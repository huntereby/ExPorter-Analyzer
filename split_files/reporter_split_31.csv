10915608,"Abstract – MUSC HARP Program
 Underrepresented in medicine (UIM) investigators are insufficiently represented among medical school
faculty. The reasons for this underrepresentation are complex, and have been attributed to such factors as
implicit bias, promotion disparities, lack of role models, and in particular, a lack of effective mentorship. As
above, population differences in clinical outcomes are well established and expected to worsen; thus, a more
diverse biomedical workforce is needed.
 The overall objective of the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) contribution to the Helping to
Accelerate Research Potential (HARP) Program in NIDDK related disease areas is to provide ready access to
quality mentoring and training - thereby enabling outstanding research in NIDDK related disease areas. Our
vision is to establish the HARP program as a sustainable resource for NIDDK related disease areas
throughout the U.S.
 Through the HARP Program in Digestive and Liver Disease, we have hypothesized that a mentoring
network for UIMs and persons with disabilities to supplement that which is present in the mentee's university
will provide additional critical and valuable mentorship. Therefore, we propose to implement innovative and
transformative researcher mentorship and training to ensure development and sustainability of the digestive
and liver disease UIM workforce. We have proposed the 3 Specific Aims as follows: Aim 1 - to establish
durable mentoring relationships and to effectively mentor a cadre of talented UIM early career scientists to
become independently funded in NIDDK related research areas through an integrated and dynamic mentorship
program. Aim 2 - Increase scholars' scientific knowledge, professional skills, motivation, and credentials to
pursue independent careers in NIDDK-related research areas via a rigorous educational and didactic program.
Aim 3 – to promote the long-term viability and success of the HARP Program in NIDDK related research areas
through rigorous evaluation, ongoing improvement strategies, and mission alignment with other HARP mentors
and centers. The MUSC HARP program will be supported not only by MUSC's CTSA, but also by its rich and
experienced institutional training programs.
 In summary, through expansion of mentorship of UIM junior investigators and promotion of interdisciplinary
exchange among mentors, Scholar's, and NIDDK leadership, the MUSC HARP Program will substantially
augment thematic NIDDK related disease research on a national level. The founding efforts proposed here
and in collaboration with the entire HARP group are expected to establish an effective, high quality,
sustainable, and multidisciplinary career development program."

The health and development of the infant is inherently linked to the health of the mother through the absorption
and secretion of nutrients. Dietary minerals, including metals (Cu, Zn, Ca, Mn, Fe) are essential nutrients
required for all aspects of physiological function. Yet the transport proteins critical for nutrient absorption and
secretion are poorly defined and there is a paucity of functional data in human tissues or in vitro models
derived from normal human cells to elucidate how and what adaptations in transporters occur to support
pregnancy and lactation. This fundamental gap must be bridged to improve health outcomes for children and
mothers. Our Transport Elucidation Center (TEC) on Minerals In Nutrition and Development (MINeD) will
capitalize on our rich scientific, clinical, and mentoring expertise to serve as a hub for discovery, bench-to-
bedside translation, and training in the area of human metal transport and nutrient uptake. The initial focus of
the MINeD center will be in the developing gut and adapting maternal intestine and breast. During pregnancy
and lactation, drastic remodeling of the mammary gland enables the synthesis and secretion of milk to sustain
and nourish the infant. Importantly, transcriptional data from human milk-derived epithelial cells point to a key
role for metal homeostasis. However, given the ethical challenges of acquiring human samples and
establishing suitable in vitro models for transport flux studies, a functional understanding of metal transporters
and their broader role in nutrient transport during lactogenesis is lacking. In Aim 1, we will address this gap in
knowledge by defining the human ‘transportome’ in lactating mammary epithelium and how it relates to the
mammary metallome to elucidate how nutrients are transported into milk. We will use human in vitro organoid
models of mammary gland function to identify functional modules of transporters that are synchronously
induced and discretely localized to accomplish transepithelial metal transport. Using gene-editing technology,
we will systematically engineer deletions in the SLC family of solute carriers to de-orphanize understudied
transporters and reveal potential new roles in milk production and secretion. In Aim 2, complementary studies
using human adult and pediatric duodenal and jejunal enteroids will determine the role of metal transporters in
intestinal adaptation and nutrient absorption to support child development, maternal pregnancy and lactation.
We will ask how pregnancy- and lactogenic hormones change intestinal proliferation, transporter protein
abundance at the plasma membrane, fat absorption, and metal content and distribution. Aim 3 of MINeD is to
build the infrastructure and fundamental discovery pipeline to support future studies on human transporters.
MINeD is well positioned to serve as a nexus for collaborations between basic and clinical research, to foster
interactions in the scientific community by sharing knowledge and resources and hosting research-in-progress
talks, workshops and seminars in the scientific areas of human transporter physiology, and to promote career
development of diverse early career scientists by providing seed funding for innovative projects."

The ability to recognize voice is an intricate feat of human audition. For the listener, the brain is able to
seamlessly extract complex linguistic and non-linguistic cues from highly variable vocal acoustic input.
Neuroimaging studies have proposed specialized regions of auditory cortex dedicated to voice perception,
including superior temporal gyrus (STG) and superior temporal sulcus (STS), referred to as “temporal voice
areas”. Functional neuroimaging studies also demonstrate these areas respond most strongly to vocalizations
of the same-species compared to other primate vocalizations and natural sounds, further suggesting
specialization of auditory cortex for vocal acoustic stimuli. It remains unknown if these regions demonstrate
true selectivity for voice, or more generally function to process the spectrotemporal features of complex
auditory stimuli, such as voice. The voice perception network has been partially described by neuroimaging
studies and suggests temporal voice areas exhibit connectivity to inferior frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus,
however these studies are limited in their ability to characterize voice areas at physiologic timescales and have
largely focused on characterizing frontotemporal white matter pathways underlying speech perception and
production. The proposed research aims to characterize local electrophysiologic responses to voice in
temporal voice areas and will describe the frontotemporal structural connectivity of the voice
perception network. I will leverage intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) from neural populations
across human auditory cortex in 15 patient-participants undergoing epilepsy surgery evaluation to examine the
neural representation of voice. Neural recordings will be acquired while participants listen to a published Voice
Localizer stimulus set optimized for iEEG research, as well as an engineered acoustic stimulus set from
modulated noise that mimick the spectrotemporal features of voice and other natural sounds, called Gaussian
Sound Patterns (GSPs). Frontotemporal connectivity of voice-selective auditory cortex will be examined across
patients using clinically-acquired diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in all patients with Voice Localizer recruited to
date (n=11) and included in this proposal (n=15). Connectivity analyses will reveal regions of frontal cortex
demonstrating connectivity to neuronal populations along STG and STS with the greatest voice-selective
responses. Together this proposal will leverage a multimodal dataset that marries local cortical iEEG
recordings at physiologic timescales and DTI structural connectivity analysis to critically examine voice
selective auditory cortex."

Obesity promotes type 2 diabetes and other adverse health outcomes, placing a significant burden on our
healthcare institutions- as well as patients with obesity. The brain contains systems that modulate feeding and
body weight over the long term. Many of these systems reside in the hypothalamus, which controls food intake
and energy homeostasis in response to a host of signals, including leptin (a hormonal signal of body energy
stores) and feeding-activated neurons in the brainstem nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). To design new therapies
to combat obesity we must understand the brain systems that control feeding and body weight, including the
hypothalamic circuits that integrate input from leptin and the hindbrain.
Prior work demonstrated that GABAergic Lepr neurons that reside in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH)
make important contributions to the control of feeding behavior, including in the suppression of orexigenic
arcuate nucleus (ARC) AgRP neurons by leptin and feeding. Additionally, our recent results showed that several
populations of food intake-suppressing glutamatergic NTS neurons project to the DMH and inhibit AgRP
neurons. While these finding suggest that a population of GABAergic DMH LepRb neurons integrates signals
from leptin and the NTS to suppress food intake by inhibiting AgRP neurons, the DMH contains many populations
of neurons with different functions, including multiple groups of GABAergic LepRb neurons. Our laboratory used
single nucleus RNA sequencing to identify known and novel populations of LepRb neurons, including a novel
population of GABAergic DMH LepRb neurons marked by glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor (Glp1r)
expression (LepRbGlp1r neurons). We found that LepRbGlp1r neurons play essential roles in the control of food
intake by leptin. We hypothesize that these LepRbGlp1r neurons represent the crucial population of GABAergic
DMH LepRb neurons that integrate signals from leptin and the NTS to suppress food intake by inhibiting AGRP
neurons. To test this overall hypothesis, we will test the notions that: (1) DMH LepRbGlp1r neurons receive direct
excitatory input from glutamatergic NTS neurons; (2) LepRbGlp1r neurons inhibit AgRP neurons and suppress
food intake; and (3) silencing LepRbGlp1r neurons will increase the activity of AgRP neurons and promote feeding
and weight gain."
10898645,"Project Summary/Abstract
The proposed fellowship plan is an interdisciplinary research project integrating training in anthropology,
medicine, and implementation science. This project is supervised by Drs. Adrienne Strong, Clarence Gravlee
(Dept. of Anthropology), Ramzi Salloum (Dept. of Health Outcomes and Bioinformatics), and Grant Harrell
(Dept. of Community Health and Family Medicine) with the resources and support of the University of Florida
(UF) College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the UF College of Medicine and the UF Clinical Translational
Sciences Institute. The proposal is designed to equip the trainee with the skills necessary to become a
physician-scientist who bridges the divide between the social sciences and clinical medicine. Social
Determinants of Health (SDH) are known to impact a wide array of physical and mental health outcomes.
However, little is known about how physicians identify and interpret patient social information, and act upon
this information in support of their patient’s health and wellbeing. This proposal will focus on US outpatient
primary care clinics for two reasons: primary care prioritizes holistic well-being of patients through the life
course and there has been a significant push in recent years to incorporate SDH interventions into primary
care clinics. Previous investigations have focused primarily on development of screening tools and limited
interventions focused on special populations or specific SDH. Such investigations pay little attention to the
informal methods providers and primary care clinics have developed to identify and address clinically relevant
social conditions in day-to-day practice, activities here collectively termed “social prescribing”. Thus, an
investigation grounded in interdisciplinary health services and implementation science literature, with an
exploratory component to allow for the description and analysis of these as yet uninvestigated practices and
beliefs relating to social prescribing is warranted. The overarching hypothesis is that patient, provider, and
clinic level factors affect primary care provider conceptualization and implementation of social prescribing
practices. The specific aims will lead to greater understanding of knowledge translation of social science
research to clinical medicine in primary care through (1) identification of factors affecting social prescribing
conceptualization among diverse primary care providers and (2) identification of factors affecting social
prescribing implementation among diverse primary care providers. Successful completion of these studies will
enhance understanding of factors affecting development, implementation, and outcomes of social prescribing
interventions across diverse care contexts. This research directly targets multiple Clinical and Health Service
Research Interest Areas defined by the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities."
10914286,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Despite notable improvements in colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment, the prognosis of patients with
metastatic CRC (mCRC) remains poor, with a median overall survival of approximately 30 months.
Immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) represents a novel therapeutic approach for a
variety of cancers including mCRC with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H). However, ICB therapy shows little
or no clinical activity in approximately 95% of patients with microsatellite-stable (MSS) mCRC. We and others
have shown that administration of either a ketogenic diet (KD) or the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB),
enhances the anticancer effects of ICB for CRC in mouse tumor models. However, whether KD/βHB can improve
ICB therapy for CRCs with MSS is not known. Moreover, the impact of altered ketogenesis on the
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) remains to be defined and represents a major gap in our
understanding of tumor immunoresistance.
 Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the major component of tumor stromal cells, play a critical role in the
tumor suppressive TME. We have shown that downregulated ketogenesis is a hallmark in CRC TME. Activation
of oncogenic signaling (e.g., WNT and KRAS) decreases ketogenesis in CRCs. Restoration of ketogenesis
inhibits aerobic glycolytic activity in CAFs and inhibits histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1)/KLF5 dependent CAF
proliferation and cytokine expression and secretion. Importantly, we showed that KD improves the
immunosuppressive TME, as noted by increased CD8+ T cell and NK cell infiltration and decreased M2
macrophage populations, and enhances the efficacy of ICB. Our findings demonstrate a previously unknown
association of downregulated de novo ketogenesis, metabolic alteration and CAF functions in the TME and have
identified cancer ketogenesis as a potential immunotherapeutic target. Based on these novel findings, we
hypothesize that downregulated ketogenesis contributes to the proliferation and immunosuppressive effects of
CAFs and thus, reprograms the CRC TME, which leads to ICB resistance and CRC progression. Our long-term
goal is to identify aberrant metabolism within the cancer and/or stromal compartments that can be used to
improve the treatment of patients with mCRC. To examine our central hypothesis, we have assembled a highly
collaborative team with significant expertise in CRC progression and treatment, tumor metabolism, tumor
immunity and neoplastic ketogenesis, and planned experiments which will determine the impact of alterations of
ketogenesis on the immunosuppressive TME in CRC, delineate ketogenic control of CAF metabolism,
proliferation, and functional potency in the TME, and define the impact of targeting ketogenic metabolism on the
efficacy of ICB for CRC. Ultimately, our findings will: i) revolutionize our concept of CRC TME and
immunoresistance; ii) significantly advance paradigms regarding the effects of KD/βHB; and iii) may provide a
novel CRC treatment strategy by targeting dysregulated ketogenic metabolism."

Developing a healthy functioning brain depends on the coordination of neuronal circuit formation by glial cells
called astrocytes. Previous work has shown that astrocytes, born from the same neural stem cells after the end
of neurogenesis, require contact with neurons to mature morphologically, functionally, and transcriptionally.
Astrocytic expression of the cell adhesion molecule neuroligin 2 (Nlgn2) is necessary for neuronal contact-
dependent astrocyte morphogenesis and synaptogenesis. These findings led us to investigate how neuronal
contact mediates astrocyte morphogenesis and synaptogenic functions. To address this question, we performed
multiplexed indexed T7 chromatin immunoprecipitation (MintChIP) sequencing to measure histone modifications
across the astrocyte genome. These experiments found that the chromatin modification landscape changes
significantly over postnatal astrocyte development. Interestingly, when we measured histone modifications in
astrocytes from Nlgn2 KO mice, we found a substantial decrease in the H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 modifications
compared to wildtype astrocytes. Based on these preliminary findings, this proposal will test the hypothesis
that epigenetic histone modifications are the mechanistic link between neuronal contact and astrocyte
transcriptional maturation. Specifically, aim 1 will test how histone modifications and transcriptional maturation
change when astrocytes are cultured with or without neurons and whether inhibiting histone-modifying enzymes
is sufficient to prevent astrocyte transcriptional maturation. Aim 2 will investigate the molecular mechanisms of
Nlgn2-dependent astrocyte transcriptional maturation. In particular, we will test the hypothesis that the chromatin
remodeler Chd8 is required for Nlgn2-dependent H3K4 methylation and that preventing this H3K4 methylation
through astrocyte-specific Chd8 knockout will prevent astrocyte transcriptional maturation. The successful
completion of these aims will determine the extent to which histone modifications regulate astrocyte maturation
and further our understanding of the molecular mechanism responsible for Nlgn2-induced gene expression
changes in astrocytes. These findings will also be highly relevant to future work in neurodevelopmental disorders
as astrocyte-regulated synaptogenesis, and epigenetic regulation of gene expression are emerging as prominent
aspects of conditions like autism spectrum disorders. Finally, this project will provide an excellent training
experience for Mr. Justin Savage through its intersection of epigenetics and glial cell biology."
10888906,"Transition-metal catalyzed cross-coupling transformations are indispensable to pharmaceutical development
and medicinal chemistry, allowing access to innumerable bond connections in extremely complex molecular
settings. Despite its power, continued reliance on transition-metal catalysis poses many challenges. For
example, a most pressing challenge in pharmaceutical synthesis is the extreme cost associated with the noble
metals that form these precious, high-powered catalysts (e.g., Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt, and Ir). Furthermore, transition-
metals are treated with strict regulation due to their elemental toxicity, imparting significant cost in the upstream
synthetic stages of delivering a drug to the marketplace. Finally, continued reliance on transition-metal catalysis
is unsustainable, threatened by the rapid depletion of raw materials at known global deposits and consistent
supply-chain disruptions. Thus, the development of alternative strategies for mild and general bond formation is
necessary for continued productivity in pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry.
 Organocatalysis is an attractive surrogate to traditional transition-metal catalysis, leveraging readily
accessible, inexpensive, and practical small molecules as catalysts. The identification of an organocatalyst with
the ability to mimic the behavior of a transition-metal catalyst forms an ideal approach; a priori, such a strategy
would be “plug and play,” invoking only a change in catalyst identity while preserving the nature of cross-coupling
partners traditionally utilized in cross-coupling chemistry. If successful, this approach would address each of the
challenges previously enumerated.
 The goal of this proposal is to design, synthesize, and develop a series of “pseudometal” organocatalysts
to facilitate a vast array of catalytic cross-coupling transformations. These catalysts are termed pseudometal to
reflect their ability to mimic the classical bond-breaking and bond-forming behavior of transition-metal catalysts.
Specifically, this research plan details the development of ortho-dithioquinones as pseudometal organocatalysts,
guided by principles of rational design, structure-activity-relationships, computational modeling, and hypothesis-
driven experimentation. Our preliminary computational results direct us to ortho-dithioquinones due to the neutral
Gibbs free energies predicted for oxidative insertion of these scaffolds into several s-bond types. In this research,
rigorous mechanistic and characterization studies will profile the key principles inherent to organocatalyst
speciation and the associated elementary steps, featuring stoichiometric studies, linear free-energy relationship
analyses, and catalytic intermediate characterization. Guided by a rich mechanistic understanding, we will
examine the synthetic capabilities of these organocatalysts through a series of cross-coupling transformations,
including examples of C–N, C–O, C–SF5, and N–CF3 bond formation. Overall, this research will establish a new
paradigm for sustainable, accessible cross-coupling chemistry, and will significantly contribute to medical
research, pharmaceutical development, and fundamental knowledge in organic synthesis."
11009493,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Functional connectivity (FC) has been found to be altered in a wide range of otherwise indistinguishable disease
states. The most common tool to non-invasively study the organization of brain-wide FC networks is functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). fMRI relies on an indirect and indiscriminate measure of activity through
the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast mechanism. By capturing fluctuations in the BOLD signal
fMRI can detect distant synchronization between brain regions either at rest or during the performance of a
specific task. These regions are inferred to be functionally connected and are thought to involve the synchrony
of neuronal populations involved in a common function that are wired together through plasticity. Interpretation
of FC networks derived from BOLD fMRI studies is currently limited by 1) the dependence of fMRI BOLD signals
on hemodynamic changes as a proxy for neural activity and 2) a limited understanding of the mechanistic basis
for FC in the context of behaviorally relevant longitudinal reorganizations. My long-term goal is to better
understand the relationship between BOLD and neural activity in behaviorally relevant multi-regional circuits to
advance brain network analysis. Once we know how both vascular and neural changes influence FC, the basis
for network dysfunctions can be exploited with fMRI providing more robust fMRI-based disease detection.
In this proposed project, I will use EMX1-Cre mice expressing a novel JEDI-1P voltage fluorescent protein in
excitatory neurons across dorsal cortex. This voltage sensor has a large spectral band, allowing us to record
both slow, subthreshold voltage activity, and fast gamma band activity. Wide-field optical imaging will be
combined with fMRI to link neuronal changes in FC to hemodynamic changes measured with fMRI. In Aim 1 I
will image these JEDI-1P at resting state to establish the correspondence between membrane voltage dynamics
and fMRI for resting state functional connectivity networks. In Aim 2 I will train these mice to perform a
sensorimotor task. I will image them during task training to assess changes in FC due to learning. I hypothesize
that the correlation between fMRI BOLD and neural activity will be regionally specific for both resting state and
task training, the latter will result in a measurable strengthening of FC between task-relevant areas. Completion
of these aims will determine how functional networks observed with BOLD relate to neural activity and will provide
insights into how FC reflects behaviorally relevant changes in the learning of a sensorimotor task. This results in
a sharper understanding of the properties of neural network activity, its dependencies, and how to harness it in
future fMRI studies."
10910876,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Racial discrimination has been identified as the primary social stressor for Black youth1 where
90% of Black youth (age 8-16) reportedly experienced at least one racial discriminatory encounter.2 As
a result of these encounters, Black adolescents experience racial stress, or race-related transactions
between individuals and their environment that are perceived as taxing or threaten well-being (e.g.,
racial microaggressions, threats of harm or injury, and witnessing harm to Black individuals).3,6 Racial
stress has been associated with an increase in depression, anxiety, and psychological distress.4 The
prevalence of racial stress among Black adolescents is alarming as it increases the likelihood of youth
engaging in risky sexual behavior and substance abuse.16To address the pervasive and ubiquitous
public health concern of the presence of racial stress in the lives of Black adolescents and their
subsequent adjustment, the overarching goal of this NRSA proposal is to utilize a multi-method
approach to (1) understand the nature of racial coping among Black adolescents, (2) identify cultural
parenting processes that predicts racial coping among Black adolescents, and (3) examine the
attenuating effects of racial coping on the association between racial discrimination and mental health
(i.e., symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress) among Black adolescents. Present understanding of
racial coping among Black adolescents is limited due to (1) the lack of inclusion of physiological
processes in racial coping measurement, (2) the use of variable-centered approaches in investigations
of racial coping, and (3) the lack of inclusion of emotion socialization in parents’ racial coping
socialization. Anticipated findings can ultimately inform the enhancement and tailoring of current and
future racial coping and mental health interventions for Black adolescents. The current project
leverages data from an existing longitudinal study on Black adolescents’ emotion regulation processes
during middle school (grades 6-8) in Richmond, Virginia: Emotion Regulatory Flexibility among African
American Adolescents Study (ERFAA; PI: Lozada, NSF CAREER Award: 2046607). The ERFAA study
collects relevant data to test the specific aims of this proposal using the assessment of physiological
and self-reported arousal and regulation while watching a video vignette of racial discrimination and
self-reported measures of racial discrimination experiences depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms.
Utilizing a person-centered approach will advance the literature by enhancing understanding of: (1)
individual differences in racial coping and (2) how those individual differences contribute to the ways
racial discrimination is associated with Black adolescents’ mental health. Additionally, I will examine a
novel observational measure of parents’ socialization to examine how Black parents' messages about
behavioral and emotional coping with racism predict Black adolescents’ racial coping profiles. Results
from the proposed research can ultimately inform the enhancement and tailoring of current and future
racial coping and mental health interventions for Black adolescents. Anticipated findings have
implications for mental and physical health development research among Black adolescent populations
and align with the key goals of the NIMH, and the NIMHD. Specifically this proposal includes the
integrative investigation of biological, behavioral, and experiential factors during an important
developmental period that can inform an understanding of the developmental pathways of health and
psychopathology."
10895431,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The goal of this proposal is to develop non-invasive single-cell technologies to improve the potency of T cell
therapies against cancer. The first 6 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies were recently approved
and >800 CAR and T cell therapies are in clinical trials. However, barriers remain in achieving durable remissions
(>1 year) for ~50% of patients who receive CAR T cell therapy. Due to the rapid development of these therapies
and a great need for process optimization, we focus on improving three translational roadblocks to effective CAR
T cell therapy: (1) screening patients whose T cells are unfit for CAR T cell manufacturing, (2) optimizing in vitro
CAR T cell production for higher potency, and (3) identifying metabolic features of potent CAR T cells in vivo.
CAR T cell therapy could be improved by enriching for naïve and stem cell memory (SCM) T cells in starting
materials and final products. Deficiencies in naïve and SCM T cells occurs in ~50% of untreated cancer patients,
and manufacturing autologous CAR T cell products from these sources has been unsuccessful. Even if SCM T
cells can be isolated, after CAR incorporation, the expansion process typically diminishes potency through T cell
exhaustion. After infusion, the presence of memory-like phenotypes in vivo correlate with better responses. To
date, there are no robust, non-destructive technologies to monitor CAR T cell manufacturing to optimize
production and assess potency in vivo at a single-cell level. These issues limit the impact of CAR T cell therapy.
Current approaches to measure T cell function are labor-intensive, destructive, or lack single-cell resolution,
which limits the frequency or specificity of these measurements. For CAR T cell therapy to realize its clinical
potential, new methods are needed to monitor T cells for optimal potency throughout manufacturing and post-
infusion. Changes in cell metabolism provide an attractive yet under-explored assay to track T cell potency.
Previous studies, including our own, show that T cells undergo drastic metabolic changes with activation, and
that naïve, exhausted, and memory-like T cells have distinct metabolic features. Our preliminary data shows that
non-invasive single-cell imaging of the fluorescence intensity and lifetime of NAD(P)H and FAD (optical
metabolic imaging, or OMI) can predict CAR T cell manufacturing conditions that produce a more vs. less
potent anti-tumor response in vivo. Given these metabolic features of CAR T cell potency, we propose to
determine whether label-free OMI of T cell autofluorescence and multivariate models can identify patient T cell
fitness, optimal in vitro expansion conditions, and in vivo cell biomarkers of potent and persistent CAR T cell
response. Overall, these technologies will streamline processes and interventions for consistently potent T cell
therapy and increase our knowledge of CAR T cell metabolism in vitro and in vivo."
10932158,"The mammalian neocortex has a remarkable ability to change over a lifetime, particularly during early
development. The development of the cortex, sensory fields and their connections are dependent on the
incoming sensory inputs from the sensory receptors in the periphery. This early, spontaneous sensory
input, together with sensory experience from the environment shapes the neocortex to generate optimal
behavior. We know from studies in humans and rodents that early loss of vision leads to massive
changes in the brain; what would normally be visual and posterior parietal cortical areas contains
neurons that respond only to somatosensory and auditory stimulation. This reorganized occipital cortex
receives ectopic input from thalamic nuclei and cortical fields associated with somatosensory and
auditory processing. The current proposal addresses several fundamental questions raised by these
previous findings: 1) How does the age of onset of blindness differentially impact cortical connectivity of
the medial and lateral divisions of the posterior parietal cortex (PPCL and PPCM)? 2) What are the
single-neuron response properties in PPCM and PPCL, and does the age of blindness onset impact
these properties? 3) What is the relationship between functional and anatomical changes PPCL and
PPCM and the compensatory behaviors mediated by the spared sensory systems? In these
experiments, bilateral enucleations in the highly altricial short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica)
will be made at two developmental milestones: 1) Prior to the onset of spontaneous activity in the retina,
before retinal geniculate axons reach the thalamus, and before thalamocortical axons have innervated
the neocortex; 2) When spontaneous activity in the retina is ongoing and retinogeniculate and
thalamocortical axons have innervated their targets. Following enucleations, animals will be assessed at
two time points allowing us to directly assess the impacts of blindness at important developmental
milestones. These data can direct therapeutic interventions to compensate for the loss of vision that
targets higher-order cortical function."
10756141,"Phenotypic plasticity is used by an incredible diversity of organisms, from plants to humans. Its ubiquity attests
to its fundamental importance in life. This project addresses the fascinating and understudied question of the
mechanistic basis of phenotypic plasticity – i.e., how developmental processes are influenced by
environmental cues to cause phenotypic differences -- and, importantly, how those processes evolve. The
focus here is on an innovative model, the pea aphid, which exhibits a textbook example of phenotypic
plasticity. This species offers an unparalleled opportunity to examine the role of nature and nurture in
phenotype determination: it exhibits dramatically different winged and wingless morphs that are induced by
environmental conditions in genetically identical, asexual females and controlled by a single genetic locus in
males. Thus, strikingly, two dimorphisms, each under different control mechanisms, exist within this single
species. The proposed experiments build on the exciting recent discoveries made by the PI about the role of
hormones and horizontally transferred genes in the female wing plasticity and about the identification of the
wing polymorphism locus in males, which has an insertion containing a duplication of a gene that influences
signaling (follistatin) and which is specific to wingless males. The proposed, vigorous research program aims to
decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and evolution of plasticity. Experiments on the
wing plasticity will examine the regulatory changes that control it, the epigenetic changes that accompany it,
and test if horizontally transferred genes are preferentially recruited into the process. Experiments on the
genetic male wing dimorphism will use functional and evolutionary studies of the follistatin paralogs to establish
how changes in these paralogs underlie male morphological evolution. Studies in females and males will be
united with experiments that will test whether or not the more recently derived male dimorphism evolved by
genetic accommodation of the female plasticity, hypothesizing that males bypass the environmental signals
used by the female plasticity. These studies will provide some of the first insights into the mechanistic basis of
genetic accommodation, where trait variation shifts from being caused by “nurture” to “nature”. These
experiments will have broad implications for understanding the mechanistic basis and evolution of plasticity,
which is significant from a human health perspective because of the numerous plastic traits that influence
human health and disease."
10928797,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The overarching goal of this project is to develop organized, sustainable clinical
research programs that enable faculty and students to conduct practice-based research at the Midwestern
University Colleges of Dental Medicine. It is expected that once students graduate from these two dental
schools, they will be adequately trained to fully participate in the National Dental PBRN. To accomplish this
goal, this project will form a partnership between the two independently operated dental schools that are part of
Midwestern University (MWU) Colleges of Dental Medicine (the College of Dental Medicine-AZ in Glendale,
AZ, and the College of Dental Medicine-IL in Downers Grove, IL)) and an inter-institutional partner: the
University of Chicago (UC) Biological Sciences Division Center for Health and the Social Sciences Program in
Oral Health (CHeSS POH). In Approach Area 1, we will leverage the expertise and resources of the UC
CHeSS POH to provide foundational clinical research training to clinical faculty and student teams at both
dental schools. Concurrently, MWU will develop an infrastructure of video recorded training materials and a
mentor network of research-oriented faculty to provide sustainability to this program by making clinical
research training a fundamental component of the institution and dental student education. In Approach Area
2, we will build upon the existing intra-institutional collaboration between both MWU dental schools, which
already share a common Research Team comprised of research-oriented faculty and laboratory technicians.
We will expand this team to include CHeSS POH members as inter-institutional partners and work
collaboratively to mentor clinical faculty and students in the conduct of practice-based research. In Approach
Area 3, we will expand the current faculty mentor-dental student pairing that occurs at both dental schools
when students enter their third year of education. Each incoming 3rd-year student is paired with a 4th-year
student already working in the clinic. These two students work for the remainder of the year as clinical
colleagues under the direct supervision of a specific clinical faculty member. By training a cohort of students
each year to conduct clinical research under the mentorship of a research-trained faculty member, the program
will produce competent clinical researchers entering the workforce as well as a research mentor network that
fosters clinical research activities in both schools. In Approach Area 4, we will provide practical experience for
the faculty/student research mentor system by conducting a practice-based research project wherein we
systematically measure longitudinal relationships between oral inflammation and functional gastrointestinal
disorders. This multisite, noninterventional prospective clinical study will provide applied training in day-to-day
study operations, including consenting, enrolling, and data collection. Upon successful completion of this
project, we will have built a sustainable, enduring clinical training program that will produce approximately 32
practice-based research trained new dental practitioners every year."

Approximately 100,000 women per year are diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia (AH) of the breast, a benign
breast lesion that is associated with a fourfold increase in risk of subsequent breast cancer. Usage of
tamoxifen as cancer prevention therapy following AH diagnosis has been linked to a greater than 50%
reduction in subsequent breast cancer incidence. However, uptake of tamoxifen and similar prevention
therapies remains low, due in part to a lack of methods to accurately determine which women are at greatest
risk for breast cancer (BC), and which women will have a beneficial response to prevention therapy. We
propose a highly translational project to address these critical barriers. We will accomplish this by identifying
molecular features in benign breast tissue that will 1) improve individualized BC risk prediction for women with
AH, 2) serve as biomarkers associated with beneficial response to prevention therapy, and 3) permit
assessment of individualized response to prevention therapy, even after a short period of treatment. In
Specific Aim 1, we will develop a breast cancer risk prediction model for women with AH that incorporates a
NanoString-based gene expression assay in combination with clinical and histological variables; in Specific
Aim 2, we will utilize a newly developed benign breast tissue cohort to identify biomarkers that predict
beneficial response to tamoxifen; in Specific Aim 3, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial of tamoxifen
versus a novel tamoxifen metabolite with less toxicity. This trial in women with AH will determine if beneficial
biomarker responses to tamoxifen are observed after only four weeks of treatment. Together, our proposed
studies will develop biomarkers that will have immediate relevance to women with AH, and implementation of
these approaches in the clinic will have a powerful and sustained impact on the field of BC prevention."
10934333,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have emerged as useful tools in research due to their capacity
to differentiate into any adult somatic cell type, including cardiomyocytes (CMs). These hiPSC-CMs have
potential use for developing preclinical models of both normal, disease-state, and even patient-specific heart
function. However, hiPSC-CM are currently limited in their clinical translatability. One of the primary challenges
in deriving cardiac tissue models from hiPSCs is heterogeneity of cardiac differentiation outcomes. Heterogeneity
in hiPSC cardiac differentiation results in low, inconsistent CM yield as well as limited control over CM subtype.
Overcoming differentiation heterogeneity will improve scalability and lower the cost of utilizing hiPSC-CM based
tissue models, as current differentiation methods achieve increased homogeneity by discarding cells that fail to
differentiate into CMs or specific CM subtypes, which is inefficient. This proposal hypothesizes that heterogeneity
in terminally differentiated hiPSCs arises from heterogeneity between hiPSC clonal lineages that leads to
variable response to differentiation cues. Accordingly, accounting for these variable responses should improve
homogeneity and consistency of hiPSC cardiac differentiation. To test this theory, a cell barcoding platform,
ClonMapper, will be used to address heterogeneity of hiPSC-CM differentiation. ClonMapper uses unique,
heritable single-guide RNA (sgRNA) barcode sequences to label cells and track clonal lineage dynamics in
response to experimental conditions, such as differentiation cues. This can be used to resolve the transcriptomic
heterogeneity of clonal lineages in hiPSCs and connect it to the transcriptomic heterogeneity of those same
lineages at different timepoints in cardiac differentiation. Aim 1 of this proposal will verify if ClonMapper is
compatible with hiPSC cardiac differentiation by labelling hiPSC populations with sgRNA barcodes and
characterizing their pluripotency. Aim 2 will connect transcriptomic heterogeneity of hiPSC lineages to
heterogeneity at different timepoints. This will allow identification of which lineages diverge from an hiPSC-V-CM
fate and when, characterization of lineages as having high (HDE) or no/low differentiation efficiency (n/LDE),
and creation of gene expression signatures associated with HDE or n/LDE lineages. The gene expression
signatures of HDE and n/LDE lineages will be used in Aim 3 to identify gene modulators that can be used as
added differentiation stimuli to shift n/LDE lineage gene expression to mimicking HDE lineage gene expression,
i.e., shift towards an hiPSC-V-CM state. The results from these studies will identify a potential source of
heterogeneity in hiPSC cardiac differentiation outcomes, elucidate the underlying mechanisms that cause this,
and establish methods for reducing heterogeneity to improve quantity and consistency of specific hiPSC-CM
subtype yield (in this case hiPSC-V-CM), advancing the clinical relevance of hiPSC-CMs."
10910877,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Many disease-associated variants in coding regions of the genome affect translated protein and enzyme
products by perturbing their folded conformation or their function, such as interactions with substrates or
macromolecular partners. However, we lack a unified predictive framework to predict functional effects of coding
variants, limiting how genomic data can be used in precision medicine. Machine learning models trained on large
sequence databases have claimed to predict deleterious effects from coding variants in several model proteins,
but to date their practical usage has been limited because of two major challenges. The first is the lack of
descriptive, “ground truth” biophysical datasets relating sequence variation to native protein properties, due to
the low throughput of traditional biochemical and biophysical experiments. The second is that there is not a well-
established method for integrating these data in state-of-the-art predictive models. To address these critical
limitations, I propose to apply cutting-edge microfluidic techniques to generate large quantitative biophysical
datasets connecting sequence variation to function in human acylphosphatase (ACYP), a model protein of the
alpha/beta fold family (found in ~10% of human proteins), and leverage these data to enhance predictive models.
This microfluidic platform (HT-MEK) contains an array of chambers that allow for parallel expression and
purification of >1,700 proteins, and provides measurements of in vitro kinetic and thermodynamic constants for
each. In Aim 1, I will engineer a series of ACYP functional assays using HT-MEK and derivative microfluidic
technologies, first testing in vitro expression, on-chip stability, and catalytic turnover of a small library of ACYP
variants and finally comparing to traditional biochemical measurements. In Aim 2, I will rapidly generate scanning
mutagenesis libraries in ACYP and make measurements across hundreds of ACYP variants on HT-MEK. In Aim
3, in collaboration with ML experts, I will use this unprecedented quantitative biochemical dataset to fine-tune a
cutting-edge deep learning to provide the first variant effects predictor enhanced by in vitro data at scale. My
preliminary data has shown that this model can generate de novo ACYP sequences that fold and are catalytically
proficient, suggesting that it will provide a strong foundation for functional prediction. Together, my results will
provide insight into the utility of in vitro, biochemical datasets from human proteins in training better predictors of
disease phenotypes. The training that I will obtain in carrying out these Aims will allow me to (1) develop skills
in research design, analysis, and interpretation of protein biophysics data; (2) learn advanced techniques in
protein biochemistry and statistical sequence analysis; and (3) obtain a competitive post-doctoral fellowship with
the long-term goal of establishing an independently-funded laboratory at a research-intensive university."
10907798,"Over 25% of children suffer from mental health problems and/or develop obesity. Mental health problems
often emerge early through a broad range of symptoms before canalizing into disorders like depression, which
affects over 15% of adolescents in the U.S. Risk for obesity also increases with age from 13% in early
childhood to 22% in adolescence. Childhood diseases greatly impact adult health, and alarmingly, rates of
child mental health problems and obesity are increasing, particularly for youth of color. Myriad early life risk
and protective factors, often inequitably distributed and made more striking by the COVID-19 pandemic, have
been associated with these outcomes; however, without large national samples and systematic identification of
priority factors, clear targets for preventive interventions remain elusive. To address these critical issues, our
interdisciplinary team leverages the unique power of ECHO Cohort data to conduct environment-wide scans
for early life predictors of adolescent depression and obesity to identify and prioritize the most powerful targets
for prevention, with a focus on sex-specific associations and improving causal inference (Aim 1). We also take
a developmentally-informed, hypothesis-driven approach to understand the intergenerational relations between
maternal childhood and pregnancy stress with childhood psychopathology risk, and if associations are sex-
specific or buffered by family and community-level protective factors (Aim 2). To do this, we calculate a new,
specialized neurodevelopmental outcome, the p-factor, which draws on multiple indicators of behavior and
mental health to generate a single latent factor of general psychopathology in childhood and adolescence. This
parsimonious, transdiagnostic measure is ideally suited for population-based child development studies that
lack deep mental health phenotyping. Finally, we retain the socioeconomically and racially diverse CANDLE
cohort (64% African American, 30% White; 700 mother-child dyads in the ECHO Program (Aim 3). Our
success collecting ECHO Cohort data and contributions to diversity are self-evident: of the 69 ECHO cohorts,
CANDLE ranks #1 in African American participants and #3 in records contributed to ECHO’s REDCap Central.
Our team strongly contributes to collaborative science, leading multiple working groups, publishing and
disseminating ECHO Cohort findings, supporting measurement development and data harmonization, and co-
leading DEI efforts. Impact: We will generate robust evidence for prevention targets, including protective
factors, to mitigate the public health impact of child mental health problems and obesity. We examine sex-
specific associations and ensure that results are generalizable to youth of color, enhancing the potential of our
findings to improve health equity. A transdiagnostic measure of pediatric psychopathology (p-factor) will be
useful to many investigators and is well-suited to the examination of multiple exposures. The CANDLE study
notably contributes to the diversity of the ECHO Cohort, and our experienced team’s continued leadership and
partnerships during the next phase of ECHO will advance collaborative science to improve child health."

NYU Grossman School of Medicine (NYUGSOM) presents an application for: (1) ongoing enrollment of
pregnancies, conceiving partners and their children from the NYU Children’s Health and Environment Study
(NYU CHES, UG3/UH3OD023305) into the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes Program
(ECHO) Cohort, (2) follow up of already enrolled mother-infant pairs and (3) piloting of the ECHO
preconception study. NYU CHES enrolls pregnant people <18 weeks gestation from NYUGSOM-affiliated
obstetric clinics. The cohort is
diverse (
50% Hispanic, 9.7% Asian, 5.2% Black; 49% Public Insurance
) and
 Over the past seven years, we exceeded our expected enrollment
by over 100% (>2000 mother-child pairs compared with the planned 1000). We sustained strong retention
despite the COVID-19 pandemic, with nearly 72-83% visit completion at each of five time points in infancy (4-7,
8-11, 12-27, 18-23 and 24-35 months) and biospecimen collection rates as high as 80% in pregnancy. We
contributed substantially to ECHO-wide science, with an emphasis on chemical/physical environmental
exposures (our Specialized Exposure area). PI Trasande was the inaugural co-chair of the Obesity Working
Group, and NYU CHES contributed specialized measures of obesity (our Specialized Outcome area) through
the application of plethysmography and dual-absorption X-ray absorptiometry. We vigorously responded to the
pandemic by co-leading the COVID-19 Working Group, completing a multi-cohort study of SARS-CoV-2
infection and birth outcomes supported by an ECHO Supplement, and obtaining funding from the NIH
RECOVER Initiative to identify long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. Our scientific
productivity is manifested not only in our 32 cohort-specific publications, but more importantly in our
contribution to a plethora of ECHO-wide publications that span all five of ECHO’s outcomes. We propose to
continue our enrollment of new pregnancies at the rate we achieved during the previous funding period (520
mother-child pairs/year). We will continue to implement the ECHO Cohort Data and Biospecimen Collection
Protocol and its central data capture system (REDCap Central) among all participants. We anticipate enrolling
200 NYU CHES mothers and their partners each year into the Preconception Pilot Study as soon as feasible
after delivery. We suggest innovative science for the pregnancy and preconception cohorts, including
expanding our study of chemical and physical exposures to include novel contaminants such as heterocyclic
aromatic amines and melamine, led by Co-I Kannan, who directs a NIEHS Human Health Exposure Analysis
Resource laboratory (U2CES026542). We apply an innovative digital platform for participant engagement,
retention and data collection developed by Vibrent Health for the NIH All of Us Study, which we recommend for
broader application in the ECHO Program. PI Trasande is an international leader in children’s environmental
health (CEH) and directs an NIEHS Collaborative Center in CEH Research and Translation.

The Navajo Birth Cohort Study (NBCS) is the first large-scale, well characterized prospective cohort study to
assess the relationships between environmental exposures, birth outcomes, and child development in a tribal
population. Representation of the Navajo population in the National ECHO cohort will contribute significantly to
the understanding of risks to Indigenous populations through comparison of exposures and outcomes with
other Indigenous populations and minority populations in ECHO, enhancing the understanding of the
contributions of cultures with respect to both similarities and differences. Through participation in ECHO, the
NBCS will build on the unique combination of characteristics to understand contributions of sociodemographic,
nutritional, cultural, and exposure variables to health outcomes as well as to positive child health. We will ask
research questions that take advantage of the size and diversity of the broader ECHO Cohorts to address key
questions about how variables such as income, education, and rurality combine with exposure variables to
contribute to health outcomes, including resiliency. We will assess language development, learning, social
communication, and neurodevelopmental diagnosis over time to understand developmental trajectories and to
ask how early-life experiences and exposures assessed through ECHO may influence these trajectories. We
also ask questions about how the COVID-19 infection and the pandemic may have affected developmental
trajectories, including potential long-covid effects. Over the course of the next 7 years in ECHO Cycle 2, we
propose to contribute data on a cumulative total of 5300 participants, inclusive of pregnancies, offspring,
conceiving partners, and current participants reconsented into the updated protocol. Our recruiting team has a
deep understanding of the culture and life circumstances that exist for our study participants and employ
multiple strategies to overcome existing barriers to participant recruitment, reconsent and retention. We
propose to recruit a minimum of 30 couples per year into the preconception pilot to address how exposures
during preconception to mixed metals or other toxicants of interest across ECHO, affect fertility, birth outcomes
and developmental trajectories of offspring. Inclusion of NBCS in ECHO provides an opportunity to assess
child health in a tribal population with diverse cultural practices and sociodemographics who experience
significant exposures to toxicants. ECHO is one of the only sources where inclusion, even at a population-
representative percentage, will allow for evaluation of child development relative to the US population overall.
NBCS contributes to the diversity of ECHO through inclusion of a group traditionally underrepresented in
population studies of this magnitude, yet adversely affected by exposures in all categories specified in ECHO,
with outcomes of clinical concern in all key outcomes addressed through the ECHO core elements."
10846813,"Summary. The ability to measure molecules and monatomic ions in the body in real-time and with high-precision
would revolutionize many aspects of both biomedical research and clinical practice. It would, for example,
provide clinicians with immediately actionable information monitoring regarding electrolyte imbalances, and the
plasma levels of drugs of dangerous narrow therapeutic windows. To this end, we are developing
Electrochemical Aptamer-Based (EAB) sensors, a demonstrably generalizable platform technology for
measuring analyte concentrations in situ in the body. Using this technique, we have already demonstrated the
real-time, seconds-resolved measurement of more than a dozen drugs, metabolites and protein biomarkers in
the veins, brains, and peripheral tissues of live rats and the subcutaneous space of human subjects for periods
of up to 24 h. Building on this, we propose here aptamer selection and aptamer-engineering approaches aimed
at improving the sensitivity of these receptors to small changes in the concentration of their target ligands. Our
first approach to this end is overcome the often-poor affinity of small-molecule-binding aptamers, thus “tuning”
of their affinities to optimally match the concentration range of clinical interest. To achieve this, we are developing
unprecedented new selection schemes, including analog-selection, an approach for obtaining initial, if
sometimes low-performance, aptamers against difficult targets, and insertion-reselection, which recursively (and
dramatically) increases the structural complexity, and thus the performance, of these initial aptamers. Our
second aim uses the excess binding energy (i.e., dissociation constants several-fold below the necessary
measurement range) afforded by these advanced selection schemes as a basis for introducing allosteric
cooperativity, a mechanism that greatly steepens binding curves. In the near term, the expected outcome of the
proposed research will be a suite of high-precision, in-vivo EAB sensors against a set of clinically important,
narrow-clinical-window drugs, metabolites, and electrolytes. The expected long-term impact of our work
however, is much broader, as our success will establish approaches by which the responsiveness of
biomolecular receptors to changing ligand concentrations can be rationally improved, a development that will
positively impact many receptor-based biotechnologies."
10745966,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Iron delivery to the brain is essential for multiple neurological processes such as myelination, neurotransmitter
synthesis and, as it is for all organs, for the utilization of oxygen for energy production. Previously, we
introduced and established the concept that brain iron uptake is regulated at the level of the endothelial cells of
the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is contrary to the widely held concept that the BBB endothelial cells serve
as a simple conduit for the delivery of transferrin. We also identified H-ferritin, classically considered an
intracellular iron storage protein, as a significant iron delivery protein for the brain. Both of these new concepts
start to address the question of how iron is acquired by the brain in a timely manner and in adequate amounts.
The importance of timely iron delivery during development is clinically manifested in the long term neurological
and cognitive impact of developmental iron deficiency. The importance of regulation to adequately manage the
amounts of iron delivered in the adult brain is clinically manifested in neurological disorders such as Restless
Legs Syndrome (too little iron) and neurodegenerative diseases (too much iron). Despite the prevailing opinion
that the BBB was a simple conduit with no apparent mechanism for regulation of brain iron uptake, we
identified age, genotype, sex, and systemic iron status as physiological factors that are associated with altered
brain iron acquisition. The immediate translational relevance of our findings will relate to treatment of systemic
iron deficiency which is treated, often aggressively, with intravenous iron injections or oral iron
supplementation. These strategies have led to considerable public health debate over concerns that these
treatments could override brain uptake mechanisms and increase brain iron accumulation leading to oxidative
stress and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the most significant knowledge gap addressed in this
application is how brain iron acquisition is regulated. The scientific premise for this proposal is that both
transferrin and H-ferritin serve as iron carriers and are taken up into endothelial cells of the BBB by different
receptors but the release of these two proteins and their iron cargo into the brain are coordinated by signals
from the cerebrospinal fluid and extracellular fluid in the brain. The major objectives for this current proposal
will be addressed using a human endothelial cell culture model of the blood-brain-barrier (Aim 1) and clinically
relevant animal models (Aim 2) to interrogate the underlying mechanisms for brain iron acquisition and
regulation, as well as to identify clinically indices of iron status on brain iron acquisition. The deliverables from
the proposed studies are: 1) how brain iron uptake is regulated which is relevant to whether a therapy can be
anticipated to work or not, 2) whether H-ferritin represents a novel iron delivery system for repleting brain iron,
and 3) what conditions affect iron uptake and thus repletion strategies."

 Additional novel therapeutic strategies based on better understanding of how specific genetic risk factors
participate in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease are necessary to further reduce
the burden associated with this major cause of death. A major genetic risk factor of cardiovascular disease is
polymorphisms in the APOE gene. ApoE is synthesized in many cell types and the importance of liver-derived
apoE in maintaining plasma lipid homeostasis is well documented. How does apoE (dys)function in other cell
type influences atherosclerosis has not been delineated completely. The goal of this project is to ascertain how
each apoE variant expressed in myeloid cells and adipocytes influences atherosclerosis. Preliminary results
showed that: (i) bone marrow cells from human APOE2 and APOE4 gene replacement mice were less effective
than APOE3 cells to reduce atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice; (ii) apoE2 and apoE4 enhance myeloid cell
inflammatory response via distinct mechanisms; and (iii) APOE2 but not APOE3 or APOE4 adipocytes are
dysfunctional with elevated intracellular cholesterol content to accelerate inflammation and atherogenesis. Our
premise is that apoE2 and apoE4 augment inflammation and metabolic dysfunctions through distinct
mechanisms, and in a cell type-specific manner, to accelerate atherosclerosis. Our hypothesis is that apoE2
causes cellular dysfunction through impaired intracellular cholesterol efflux, whereas apoE4 causes myeloid cell
dysfunction by inducing oxidative and ER stress. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that myeloid apoE2 expression
increases myelopoiesis and promote early stages of atherogenesis, whereas myeloid apoE4 accelerates
atherosclerosis advancement to later stages due to its impairment of efferocytosis and metabolic stress. Single-
cell RNA-seq will be performed on lesion smooth muscle and immune cells at 3 stages of atherosclerosis to
delineate how each apoE variant expressed in myeloid cells influences smooth muscle cell plasticity and lesion
immune cell repertoire to alter lesion composition and enhance atherosclerosis. Follow-up studies will test the
effectiveness of reducing intracellular cholesterol levels in APOE2 bone marrow cells and reducing ER stress in
APOE4 bone marrow cells in atherosclerosis protection. Aim 2 will transplant macrophage-depleted perivascular
adipose tissues (PVAT) from APOE2 and APOE3 mice to the carotid arteries of Ldlr-/- mice to test the hypothesis
that the dysfunctional APOE2 adipocytes recruit inflammatory cells to the PVAT tissue to promote inflammation,
which in turn signals to the vasculature to enhance inflammatory cell recruitment to the lesion area to exacerbate
atherosclerosis. Single-nucleus RNA-seq will be performed to compare how adipocyte-derived apoE2 and apoE3
influences adipocyte plasticity and elicit different immune cell repertoires to the PVAT and vasculature to
modulate atherosclerosis. We will also test the hypothesis that increasing cholesterol efflux in APOE2 adipocytes
will reduce inflammation and atherossclerosis. Novel mechanistic information gained from these studies can be
harnessed to design personalized intervention strategies based on APOE genotype to reduce vascular diseases."

10746397,"Technology Development Unit: PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of the U54 Northwestern University Center for Chromatin Nanoimaging in Cancer (NU-CCNIC)
is to develop and deploy a multi-scale chromatin nanoimaging platform together with molecular analyses and
computational modeling to characterize chromatin structure and transcriptional patterns associated with cancer
stem cells (CSCs) and the chemoresistance phenotype. We seek to fill three technology gaps in developing
such a nanoimaging platform. (1) The multi-scale challenge stems from the need to investigate how chromatin
regulates gene expression across a wide range of scales, from the diameter of DNA (~2 nm) to the size of
nucleosomes (~10 nm) to chromatin domains (~100 nm) to cell nuclei (~10 µm) and to a population of cells to
account for intercellular heterogeneity. (2) The multiplexed molecular imaging challenge arises due to a large
number of critical genes and molecular regulators that need to be co-registered with the 3D chromatin structural
data. And (3) The temporal dynamics challenge requires the ability to work across a wide range of time scales
to study short-term processes that may occur within minutes, such as chromatin remodeling, and long-term
processes that may progress over weeks, such as the emergence of chemoresistance in cancer cells. No single
technique satisfies all three requirements.
 Our solution to address these three challenges is to organically correlate three families of technologies:
chromatin scanning transmission electron microscopy (ChromSTEM), spectroscopic single-molecule localization
microscopy (sSMLM), and partial wave spectroscopic (PWS) nanosensing microscopy. After registering these
technologies with 1 nm precision, they will collectively satisfy the multi-scale, multiplexing, and dynamics
requirements. We will achieve three objectives in TECH. (1) Develop next-generation sSMLM that enables, in
principle, unlimited multiplexing with the highest photon utilization and at 1 nm spatial precision. (2) Develop
correlative ChromSTEM-sSMLM-PWS imaging that enables cross-modality registration at 1 nm precision
assisted by novel quantum dot-based nano assembly fiduciary markers. And (3) Develop a multi-scale
molecular modeling platform to elucidate the etiological relationship between chromatin structure and
transcriptional reprogramming in CSCs imaged with the nanoimaging platform. The proposed technology
development is driven by the needs of the Research Test-Bed unit (RTB) to elucidate epigenetic and chromatin
drivers of transcriptional plasticity in CSC processes, in particular the development of adaptive resistance to
chemotherapy, and to explore the feasibility of reprogramming CSCs out of the stem-states as a therapeutic
strategy. Continuous feedback from RTB investigators will be integrated with the TECH platform's optimization,
enabling, in the longer-term, our U54 technologies to impact the broader cancer research community within and
beyond the Cellular Cancer Biology Imaging Research Network."

The overall goal of the U54 Northwestern University Center for Chromatin Nanoimaging in Cancer (NU-CCNIC)
is to develop and deploy a multi-scale chromatin nanoimaging platform together with molecular analyses and
computational modeling to characterize chromatin structure and transcriptional patterns associated with the
cancer stem cell (CSC) and chemoresistance phenotype. The immediate application of the proposed studies will
be ovarian cancer, a malignancy of unmet need. It has been speculated that CSCs represent the reservoir from
which recurrent, chemotherapy-resistant tumors arise. The key biological question addressed by this Center is
whether reprogramming of the transcriptome through epigenetic and chromatin organization-regulated
mechanisms leads to significant transcriptional plasticity, which is critical for CSCs to withstand and survive
stressors in the tumor environment, driving tumor initiation and progression. As part of NU-CCNIC, the Research
Test-Bed Unit (RTB) will provide source materials for the nanoimaging technologies developed by the
Technology Development Unit (TECH). These resources include cells and tissues at various transition points
between stem cell and non-stem cell phenotypes and between chemotherapy-sensitive and resistant states. The
studies conducted by the RTB will test the applicability of the Nanoscale Chromatin Imaging and Analysis (nano-
ChIA) platform and provide feedback to optimize its use. In addition, the RTB will perform state-of-the-art
computational genomic analyses of CSCs and chemotherapy-resistant cells, including single-cell mRNA
sequencing and genome mapping (e.g., Hi-C, ATAC-sequencing and ChIP-sequencing). The specific
objectives of this unit are: 1) To identify CSC-specific epigenomic features and 3D chromatin packing
conformations by integrating genome-wide maps of chromatin accessibility, contact frequency and gene
expression networks with high resolution nano-scale chromatin imaging features. 2) To identify whether the
transition to a chemotherapy-resistant state promotes stemness-like chromatin packing and conformation. Locus
specific epigenetic manipulations will be coupled with high resolution imaging technologies to investigate
resistant-state specific 3D chromatin packing and its relation to the CSC state. 3) To discover how global
epigenome manipulations induced by small enzymatic inhibitors block stemness and chemo-resistance through
alterations of chromatin packing. In all, the integrated interrogation of cancer through chromatin nanoimaging
methods (TECH) and genome-wide mapping (RTB) will discover how transcriptional plasticity of CSCs and
chemo-resistant cancer cells is regulated. The project is at the forefront of the field by using highly innovative
molecular and nanometer-scale chromatin imaging technologies to better understand the relationship between
higher level chromatin structure and key drivers of stemness and chemo-resistance in a disease that remains
lethal and difficult to treat."

10876989,"The interaction between cancer cells and platelets plays important roles in regulating cancer cell function.
Understanding how platelets communicate with cancer cells to modulate cancer cell colonization at distant
organs may identify novel strategies to halt cancer spreading. We recently showed that recruitment of platelet to
cancer cells is essential for the colonization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) at the secondary organs. However,
the molecular mechanism by which platelets modulate cancer cell function to promote cancer cell colonization
remains to be determined. By analyzing RNA-seq data from CTCs and primary tumors, we found that platelet-
specific mRNA was significantly enriched in CTCs. RNAscope and Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification
(TRAP) analyses showed the delivery of platelet mRNA and translation of platelet-derived mRNA in cancer cells.
In vivo functional screening identified multiple platelet-derived mRNAs contribute to colonization of breast cancer
cell at distant organs. These results reveal the new role of platelet mRNA in mediating intercellular
communication and in promoting cancer cell spreading. The overall objective of this proposal is to define the
molecular mechanism by which platelet mRNA is delivered into breast cancer cells and determine roles of platelet
mRNA as the signaling molecular in promoting cancer cell colonization at distant organs. We showed that CD9
expression in CTCs correlated with the accumulation of platelet-specific mRNA. Silencing CD9 in breast cancer
cells significantly reduced platelet mRNA transferring and colonization of cancer cells. Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is
a small cytokine belonging to the CXC chemokine family that is highly expressed in platelets. We showed that
the transfer of PF4 mRNA from platelets to breast cancer cells enhanced stemness and colonization of cancer
cells. Based on these results, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the CD9-dependent mRNA transfer
mediates the platelet-cancer cell communication and promotes cancer cell stemness. We propose the following
two aims to test this hypothesis and achieve our objective. Aim 1. Elucidate the mechanism by which platelet
mRNA is transferred into cancer cells. Aim 2. Determine how the transfer of platelet PF4 mRNA in cancer cells
promotes cancer metastasis."
10873736,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Anxiety disorders affect approximately 30% of the U.S. population1, with over 1 in 4 adults meeting diagnostic
criteria for at least one lifetime anxiety disorder2. Anxiety disorders are a major public health burden3, as they
are associated with a decreased quality of life4, substantial functional impairment5, and an enormous economic
cost6,7. Despite these considerable ramifications, treatments for anxiety are only moderately effective8,
highlighting the need to further identify and explore risk factors that may improve prevention and treatment
efforts. Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is one important risk factor implicated in the development of anxiety
disorders9. Uncertainty permeates daily life and is generally found to be somewhat discomforting, though
individuals differ greatly on the degree to which they tolerate uncertainty. Experiencing uncertainty as
intolerable can elicit dysfunctional responses such as worry, negative mood, and avoidance behavior10,11, all of
which are thought to contribute to the development of anxiety symptoms12. Importantly, research on how IU
contributes to risk for anxiety is constrained by two main limitations. First, the definition of IU in the clinical
literature is imprecise and may conflate two distinct components of uncertainty tolerance identified by the
computational behavioral decision-making field. Further research using multimodal assessments is needed to
integrate these distinct operationalizations of IU, in line with the NIMH RDoC Initiative which emphasizes the
importance of considering multiple levels of analysis13. Second, there is virtually no research on IU using
longitudinal, within-person designs, thus limiting our understanding of how IU influences affective and
behavioral responses to real-life uncertainty. The proposed study will use novel methodologies to both address
these conceptual limitations and expand research on how IU contributes to the development of anxiety over
time. Specifically, this study will: a) compare clinical assessments of IU and behavioral measures derived from
computational modeling, b) use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to assess whether individual
differences in clinical and behavioral IU predict daily negative affect and behavioral avoidance responses, and
c) investigate whether daily affective and behavioral responses contribute to downstream anxiety symptoms.
Results of this proposed study would advance the measurement of IU, providing a better understanding of how
IU contributes to risk for anxiety and ultimately contributing to the development and refinement of treatments
for anxiety disorders. This proposal has important implications for preventing and treating anxiety. Through this
proposed study, the applicant will acquire additional training and experience in intensive longitudinal study
design, advanced statistical techniques, and multimodal assessment methods, including computational
modeling approaches. The experience gained through this fellowship will lay the groundwork for the applicant
to become an independent researcher investigating the transdiagnostic risk factors of anxiety pathology, with
the ultimate goal of identifying malleable targets for the development of more effective treatments for anxiety."
10750952,"Humans are generally social and these social relationships can promote a healthier lifestyle and
increase longevity. Yet, when these social relationships are lost or come to an end, the perceived
social isolation and accompanying loneliness can lead to significant physiological, psychological,
and social consequences that impair an individual’s ability to function and greatly impairs their
quality of life. Although it is widely recognized that social bonds contribute to health, the
mechanism(s) by which social bond disruption translates into compromised mental and physical
health are not fully appreciated. An understanding of the biological substrates that drive social
bonds, and the negative sequelae following loss of social bonds, is essential to develop a
framework for pharmacological interventions to reduce health risks associated with loneliness.
The conditions and disorders associated with loneliness have each been linked to inflammation
and metabolic disruption. The proposed studies will determine the extent to which social bond
disruption engages inflammatory and metabolic substrates in the brain of a social species. Given
that the negative effects of loneliness are not simply ameliorated by the presence of other
individuals in humans, it is essential to examine the underlying protective mechanisms of social
bonds, and the biology engaged when bonds are broken, in order to develop interventions aimed
at optimizing physical and psychological outcomes for those lacking positive social support. The
overarching hypothesis of this line of inquiry is that the neural-glial response engaged by social
bond disruption increases neuroinflammation and compromises neural mitochondrial function
through disruptions in oxytocin (OT) signaling. Using the socially and genetically monogamous
California mouse (Peromyscus californicus), we will determine the extent to which pair bond
dissolution increases the neuroinflammatory response to challenge and the extent to which
stress-related behaviors can predict the anticipated inflammatory response to pair bond
dissolution (Aim 1). We will also test whether pair bond dissolution disrupts synaptosome
mitochondrial function (Aim 2). Lastly, we will determine to what extent OT can ameliorate the
impact of pair bond dissolution on the neural-glial axis (Aim 3). The impact of social experiences
on the brain may be critical to understanding the biological drivers of mental health disorders and
neurodegenerative conditions, like Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias."
10750957,"Obesity is an important risk factor for many serious diseases including many types of cancer.2-36 In the
United States, obesity disproportionally affects underserved population groups such as racial and ethnic
minorities, persons with lower socioeconomic status, and persons living in rural areas.1,37,38 These underserved
groups are also at increased risk for developing and dying from cancer.39-42 Large clinical trials, such as Look
AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes), have shown that a multicomponent weight loss intervention combining
diet, physical activity, and behavioral modification is effective in achieving long term weight loss which resulted
in a lower incidence of obesity-related cancers.43-45 As a result, clinical practice guidelines recommend the
delivery of obesity interventions in primary care settings. However, it is unknown if such weight loss
interventions work well in underserved populations or in rural settings because of limited access to healthcare
resources and community facilities for a healthy lifestyle and/or because the target population may have
different cultural and social backgrounds.
 To overcome these specific barriers to implementing a weight loss intervention, we propose a practice-
based clinical trial to translate the efficacious Look AHEAD Intensive Lifestyle Intervention (ILI) to underserved
populations. In this project, we will modify the intervention to be delivered through Health IT specifically the
patient portal in the electronic health record (EHR) and will work with the Methodist Medical Group to
establish partnerships between the investigators and community stakeholders. This project tests whether the
Look AHEAD Intensive Lifestyle Intervention (ILI) will result in significant weight loss when delivered through
Health IT- EHR patient portal compared to a Comparison intervention. This project will be conducted in 2
stages: a formative assessment stage (Stage 1) and a clinical trial stage (Stage 2). During Stage 1, we will
modify the interactive technology-based Look AHEAD ILI that we already developed for the TARGIT study
(Active Intervention Group). We will also adapt the Look AHEAD Comparison condition (DSE group) for our
Comparison condition.56 We will also optimize the protocol for acceptability in underserved populations and in a
rural setting. During Stage 2, we will randomly assign 250 participants to either the Comparison Group or the
Active Intervention Group to address the primary aim of testing the hypothesis that a multicomponent,
behavioral weight loss intervention delivered through Health IT – EHR patient portal will lead to significantly
greater weight loss 12 months after enrollment compared with a comparison group. Our Health IT-based
intervention is potentially cost-effective and thus disseminable to any practice-based physician group with
access to an EHR with a patient portal. We have chosen the Socio-ecological Model as our conceptual model
to assist with understanding social determinants of health as related to the study intervention and weight loss."
10750960,"Project Summary
 The long-term objective of this study is to establish an autologous endothelium on the blood-contacting surface
of implantable cardiovascular devices. This is critically important for providing hemocompatibility and minimizing
the risk of thrombosis, embolism, and other adverse outcomes in order to improve patient safety.
 This objective directly supports the mission of the NHLBI to promote the treatment of heart diseases and
enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more productive lives. Many cardiovascular
diseases are treated with implantable devices. While lifesaving, these devices also carry an inherent risk of
thrombosis and embolism that requires administration of anticoagulation therapy.
 The proposed study addresses the dire clinical need for establishing an endothelium within small-diameter
vascular grafts. Patients with coronary heart disease who require bypass surgery currently undergo autologous
vessel harvest because synthetic grafts demonstrate poor patency in small-diameter applications. Autologous
vessel harvest is associated with additional cost and significant donor site morbidity. In addition, a large and
growing number of patients do not possess suitable autologous vessel for reasons including preexisting vascular
disease, vein stripping, and previous harvest. Establishment of an autologous endothelium on small-diameter
bypass grafts is necessary for achieving acceptable patency rates without autologous vessel harvest.
 The goal of the proposed research is to improve endothelial cell retention on vascular graft biomaterials by
identifying novel molecular signaling targets for molecular modulation strategies to promote cellular adhesion
strength. This is driven by our hypothesis that differential regulation of molecular signaling pathways involved in
cellular adhesion is responsible for a subpopulation of endothelial cells resisting detachment upon implantation.
 Specific Aim 1 will identify molecular signaling pathways responsible for allowing a subpopulation of endothelial
cells to remain adherent upon exposure to physiological shear stress. RNA-sequencing will be used to compare
the transcriptome of all cells and adherent cells. The transcriptomics data will be used to identify molecular
signals that are highly differentially regulated in adherent cell subpopulations.
 Specific Aim 2 will develop and test strategies to improve endothelial cell retention on vascular graft
biomaterials. A molecular modulation strategy will be developed to enhance cell adhesion by upregulating or
downregulating critical signaling molecules as appropriate. Cell retention will be compared under conditions of
physiological shear stress.
 Specific Aim 3 will assess the biological performance of small-diameter vascular grafts seeded with endothelial
cells using a preclinical model. The most promising cell adhesion enhancement strategy will be used to
endothelialize grafts, which will be implanted into the carotid circulation of swine and analyzed for clinically
relevant outcomes including cell retention, patency, thrombosis, neointimal hyperplasia, and inflammation."
10752907,"Background: Approximately 200K transitioning service members/Veterans (TSMVs) separate
from the military annually and they face elevated suicide risk levels for at least six years after
separation. Suicide risk is greatest for those with the most difficulty reintegrating into civilian life
roles at home, work, and in the community. Current research on the military-to-civilian
reintegration process suffers from a lack of systematized measurement, longitudinal studies, and
attention to modifiable factors that influence how individuals respond to disruptive life events. This
CDA-1 proposal will leverage longitudinal data from a VA research repository to address these
gaps by conducting the first in-depth psychometric investigation of the Military-to-Civilian
Questionnaire (M2CQ), followed by an investigation of how reintegration difficulties develop over
time. Further, it will evaluate DSM-5 personality functioning as a modifiable predictor of
reintegration challenges and subsequent suicide risk during the transition period. Significance:
Rehabilitation is relevant to the reintegration of all TSMVs, who share the goal of adapting to post-
military life roles. This CDA-1 will deliver recommendations for assessing reintegration and yield
critical insights for identifying TSMVs prone to reintegration difficulty. These are essential steps
for detecting intervention targets that promote positive functional outcomes and disrupt suicide
risk trajectories. Identifying modifiable predictors of reintegration difficulty will inform a future
CDA-2 application focused on developing targeted interventions to address those factors. This
CDA-1 is aligned with priorities outlined by the White House’s National Strategy for Preventing
Veteran Suicide and the VA’s National Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End Suicide. This
project is also responsive to RR&D’s request for suicide prevention research that involves
Veterans not currently receiving VA healthcare. Innovativeness: The proposed research
represents the first comprehensive psychometric evaluation of the M2CQ in a longitudinal sample
of TSMVs. Second, by incorporating the construct of personality functioning, it suggests new ways
of thinking about reintegration difficulty and its relationship to suicide risk. Third, the longitudinal
design includes pre- and post-transition timepoints, which provide a unique opportunity to directly
evaluate temporal changes in reintegration difficulties as a function of co-occurring personality
functioning problems and the major life event of separation from service. Specific Aims: Aim 1 is
(a) to investigate the M2CQ’s structural validity, reliability, and item-level properties; (2) evaluate
how well M2CQ scores/items detect meaningful and expected change in functioning over time; (3)
to determine whether total scores and items have particularly strong associations with negative
clinical outcomes. Aim 2 is to evaluate personality functioning as a potentially modifiable
individual difference factor that is associated with reintegration difficulties. Aim 3 is to examine
alternative hypotheses about the roles of reintegration difficulty, personality functioning, and
psychopathology in predicting future suicidal thoughts and behavior during the military transition
period. Methodology: This CDA-1 will use a longitudinal sample of TSMVs who participated in
two ongoing community reintegration peer-sponsorship programs. Four waves of data were
collected over a one-year period (n = ~ 515): 6- and 2-months before separation; 2- and 6-months
post-separation. Statistical analyses include factor analysis, item response theory, and latent
growth curve modeling. Next Steps/Implementation: Research results and recommendations for
assessing reintegration difficulty will be shared with the VA research and clinical community."
10906162,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Persistent hyperactivation of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway contributes to oncogenesis in over 30% of human
cancers. Trametinib (Trm) is a highly selective inhibitor of MEK1, the sole upstream activator of multifunctional
pro-survival kinases ERK1/2. Trm commonly is used in combination with dabrafenib to prolong life in patients
with melanoma; its efficacy in other common tumor types including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is being
widely explored. Trm generally is well tolerated, though it can cause cardiomyopathy that may lead to heart
failure (HF) in up to 11% of cases. The mechanisms underlying Trm-associated cardiotoxicity are unclear. Our
preliminary data show that 14-day Trm treatment abrogated mouse myocardial ERK1/2 activation and induced
reversible cardiac contractile dysfunction characterized by reduced mitochondrial abundance and compromised
oxidative phosphorylation in vivo. RNAseq analysis of Trm-treated mouse hearts revealed broad decreases in
mitochondrial transcripts and increases in immune response pathways that are molecularly distinct from other
HF etiologies. In vitro exposure of primary cardiomyocytes to Trm caused mitochondrial injury and activated
canonical inflammatory pathways. These surprising effects were not predicted by our current understanding of
MEK-ERK cardiomyocyte biology or by our understanding of the anticancer mechanisms of MEK inhibitors
(MEKi’s). Here we will use 3 specific aims to test the central hypothesis that MEK-ERK inhibition impairs
OXPHOS to induce mitochondrial injury resulting in innate immune activation, and that these effects collectively
contribute to both the cardiotoxicity and anticancer efficacy of Trm. In the mechanistic Aim 1 we will find if Trm
induces mitochondrial injury by compromising oxidative phosphorylation and inducing oxidative stress. Aim 2
will determine whether genetic or pharmacological loss of MEK function is sufficient to induce cardiomyocyte
mitochondrial injury using novel mouse models of cardiomyocyte MEK1 deficiency and other FDA-approved
pharmacological MEKi’s. Aim 3 will test whether Trm-induced mitochondrial toxicity activates innate immune
responses in cardiomyocytes and cancer cells using a validated mouse model of TNBC and a clinically relevant
combination targeted therapy. These studies will establish whether activation of pattern recognition receptors
by mitochondrial damage associated molecular patterns contributes to Trm cardiotoxicity or anticancer efficacy,
and will define whether the addition of Trm to an immune checkpoint inhibitor enhances cardiotoxic risk. The
proposed experiments have the potential to impact the fields of myocardial biology and cancer therapeutics in
related but distinct ways: (1) Expand our understanding of MEK-ERK regulation of cardiomyocyte mitochondrial
function; (2) Identify the molecular processes that contribute to Trm cardiotoxicity; (3) Determine whether
mitochondrial toxicity and innate immune activation contribute to the anticancer efficacy of Trm and other MEKi’s."
10896299,"Adverse effects of environmental contaminants on human health are a major public health concern.
We are all exposed to a complex mixture of different chemical contaminants through the air we breathe,
the water we drink, the food we eat, and the products we use. As new industrial products are produced,
leading to new direct and indirect exposures, there is a pressing need for new tools for assessing the
adverse health effects in humans associated with exposure to chemical mixtures. Challenges include huge
numbers of different possible mixtures, the curse of dimensionality in multivariate nonparametric
regression and moderate to high correlation in different exposures. Building on compelling preliminary
results from a highly successful NIEHS PRIME program R01, we develop a transformative statistical
toolbox for inferences on health effects of chemical exposures, both in the high throughput screening
context and for better disentangling health effects of chemical mixtures in epidemiology studies. The
research proceeds through the following Aims. Aim 1 develops methods for inferring synergistic and
antagonistic interactions from epidemiologic data, including for data collected longitudinally motivated
by studies of exposure effects on childhood neurodevelopment. We improve substantially over current
nonparametric regression approaches in interpretability and power to detect interactions; synergistic
interactions in which chemicals amplify each other’s effects are particularly important. Aim 2 develops
clustering methods to improve understanding of variation in exposure in relation to health. These
methods will have broad impact in dramatically improving practical performance over current model-
based clustering approaches. In addition, easily interpretable results are provided, adding additional
insights over state-of-the-art regression-based methods. Aim 3 develops new methods for inferring
relationships between chemical molecular structure and biologic activity. Given the sheer number
of chemicals lacking any direct in vivo or in vitro data, it becomes crucial to use molecular structure to
predict biologic activity. Leveraging on ToxCast/Tox21 and other data sources, we develop improved
statistical models for relating chemical structure to activity, for inferring low-dimensional summaries of
chemical activity based on molecular structure, and for optimally choosing the next chemicals to be tested.
These methods can be used to predict effects of chemicals lacking any direct in vivo or in vitro data
through targeted borrowing of information across related chemicals in the database. Aim 4 develops
user-friendly and reproducible software, while using the methods to thoroughly analyze data from the
motivating epidemiology studies, with a particular focus on the Mount Sinai Children’s Environmental
Health Study and the UNC Early Life Factors Study, which both focus on assessing exposure effects on
neurodevelopment in early childhood. We expect our methods to lead to important new findings."

Improving Cultural Competency Across the Mental Healthcare Delivery Network.
The American Psychiatric Association (APA) is requesting an Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality (AHRQ) Conference grant to support the convening of a Cultural Competency Symposium.
Through this symposium, APA aims to create a collaborative learning opportunity for mental health
clinicians to develop the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to provide culturally congruent mental
health treatment and care delivery within diverse communities. Aligned with AHRQ’s mission, this
symposium will offer a unique opportunity to assemble early career psychiatrists, trainees, students, and
key community stakeholders to share and disseminate research products, experiences, curricula, and
syllabi focused on cultural competency implementation. The proposed 2024 symposium will deliver
evidence-based engagement strategies and culturally relevant care frameworks through presentations
and panel discussions to support culturally competent mental health care delivery and practice.
APA aims to achieve the following through this symposium:
 • Support mental health providers and clinicians in developing a foundational understanding of the
 core tenets of cultural competency and health equity.
 • Create a space for clinicians and community stakeholders to engage in collaborative learning
exchanges.
 • Highlight the importance of trauma-informed care in culturally diverse communities.
 • Reinforce the importance of culturally affirming mental health service delivery for sexual and

10754549,"Malaria transmission in the field requires the production of sexual stage Plasmodium parasites, called
gametocytes, that once taken up by an Anopheles mosquito fertilize and differentiate into infectious
sporozoites. Sporozoites collect in the mosquito salivary gland and can be introduced to a new host during a
blood meal. As would be expected, higher gametocyte levels in the human host's peripheral blood increase the
chance of productive transmission to a mosquito, but gametocyte levels vary between individuals and the
factors that determine carriage are unknown. No tools are available to identify individuals that carry immature
P. falciparum gametocytes to determine the efficiency of stage V gametocyte development or to target carriers
for treatment before they become infectious. In a recent field study of 260 symptomatic malaria patients in
Ghana we developed a new assay to quantify circulating gc-rings and found a wide range of gametocyte
conversion rates. In 20% of the samples the ratio of gc-rings to asexual rings was > 4.9% with a high of 70%,
while 24% of the samples had no gc-rings, which clearly demonstrates variation in gametocytogenesis
between patients. Using this data we found that gametocyte conversion was positively associated with
parasitemia, while body temperature was negatively associated. We also found high gametocyte conversion
was associated with a specific allele of a gene previously reported to be critical for gametocyte production in
vitro, gametocyte development 1 protein (gdv1) and the upregulation of three enzymes. We hypothesize that
these factors and genes are causally associated with P. falciparum gametocytogenesis and plan to test this
directly in vitro (Aims 1 and 2). We will also extend our in vivo analysis of gametocyte dynamics to one of the
major infectious reservoirs in West Africa, asymptomatic children 5-15 years old (Aim 3). Children will be
followed longitudinally from the start to the end of the malaria season in Ghana (May-Nov) and again in the dry
season (Apr) over the course of 2 years in 2 different sites. This prospective longitudinal study design will allow
for the first time the evaluation of asexual and gc-ring production as well as gametocyte maturation/survival
and host parameters in the same individual over time. The two week sampling period is the same as the time
needed for a P. falciparum gc-merozoite invaded RBC to mature to a stage V gametocyte. The direct
comparison of gc-rings and stage V gametocytes produced two weeks later will indicate whether gc-ring levels
can be used to predict the number of stage V gametocytes found in the circulation two weeks later or whether
some individuals effectively clear sequestered gametocytes prior to maturation. Evidence for gametocyte
clearance would provide new targets for transmission-blocking interventions. Together, the data from all three
aims will allow us to determine whether the host environment or the parasite or host genotype are major
drivers of malaria transmission, providing critical information for the design of malaria control strategies."
10752825,"Chronic pain (CP) is a serious concern that disproportionately affects Veterans compared to the general
public; Veterans are diagnosed with CP at high rates (47 – 56%) with a 40% greater rate of severe pain than
non-Veterans. The negative functional outcomes of chronic pain among Veterans are wide-ranging and include
decreased ability to complete daily work activities, less social support from and closeness with family members,
increased chronic health conditions (e.g., heart disease), and higher mortality compared to Veterans without
chronic pain. Unfortunately, the use of medication for long-term pain treatment, though often utilized, has
both limited efficacy and potentially harmful outcomes. Given these concerns, there is an urgent need for
innovative and integrative approaches for non-medical pain self-management. Despite the critical importance
of effective pain self-management programs, many Veterans with chronic pain do not engage in the pain self-
management programs currently offered by VA. There are numerous reasons for this, including perceived time
and transportation concerns and pain-related barriers to attending in-person care. Thus, the development and
evaluation of innovative, evidence-based interventions for pain management that can be accessed from home is
a crucial step towards improving quality of life for Veterans with chronic pain.
 One approach with over twenty years of efficacious treatment for chronic pain is Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy for Chronic Pain (ACT-CP). ACT is a well-established and VA-approved approach to
chronic pain management, and focuses on committing to behavior change that reflects personal values, leading
to significant improvement in life functioning. Though provided at many VA hospitals, clinician-delivered ACT
for chronic pain has not had a nationwide rollout and is not available at all VA pain clinics. Additionally, many
Veterans with chronic pain do not access one-on-one therapeutic treatment due to transportation and time
issues. Thankfully, for adults with chronic pain outside of the VA, technology-delivered ACT has been found to
be acceptable, useful, and efficacious in delivering pain treatment. However, although research suggests it
could help with at-home pain management, no ACT for chronic pain online treatment exists specifically for
Veterans and their particular care needs.
 To address this treatment option gap, our research team created an online Veteran ACT for chronic pain
(VACT-CP) during the PI’s Rehabilitation R&D CDA-2 project. VACT-CP is guided by an interactive virtual
coach (Coach Anne) to help address pain-related distress and functional difficulties of chronic pain (e.g.,
avoidance, reactivity) over seven weeks of treatment. Preliminary findings demonstrate that VACT-CP is highly
usable, perceived as helpful, and can help Veterans increase their pain acceptance and pain management. The
primary outcomes for this project will be to complete a three-site, fully-powered efficacy trial comparing VACT-
CP to an active online control condition (total n = 200) to investigate whether VACT-CP can improve pain-
related functioning and quality of life. In addition, we will analyze data from the VACT-CP group to assess
whether the hypothesized mechanism of change (psychological flexibility) mediates the impact of pain severity
on pain-related functioning."
10749015,"Defects in DNA damage response (DDR) is major factor that predispose normal cells to acquire oncogenic
mutations. However, after a tumor develops, cancer cells manage their survival by repairing DNA damage
resulting from unchecked DNA replication. Cancer cells can use the alternative or backup DNA repair programs
to overcome their DDR defects. For example, cancer cells with deficiency in homologous recombination (HR)
proteins (such as BRCA1) can repair their DNA by either relying on other highly expressed HR-related proteins
(such as RAD51 or PARP1) or by using other DNA repair mechanisms such as alternative non-homologous end
joining (ALT NHEJ) and basal excision repair (BER). The addiction of cancer cells to these rescue DNA repair
pathways contributes to therapy-resistance; therefore, successful targeting of factor(s) that play critical role in
multiple DNA repair pathways will have promising clinical outcomes. Alterations in DNA repair pathways
commonly occur during breast cancer (BC) progression. For example, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) an
aggressive BC subtype that frequently relapses as distant metastases, have dysfunctional BRCA1 but expresses
high levels of RAD51. Further, estrogen receptor positive BC (ER+BC), which accounts for ~70% of all BCs,
employs ALT NHEJ, HR or BER to repair their DNA. Notably, ER+BCs acquire resistance to endocrine therapy
and DNA-damaging chemotherapy drugs by inducing expression of DNA repair genes. A key factor that is
involved in regulating multiple DNA repair pathways is FOXM1, which is highly expressed in TNBC and therapy
resistant ER+BCs. FOXM1 is known to promote resistance to chemotherapy drugs and anti-estrogen therapies.
In this proposal, we provide compelling evidence that imipramine blue (IB), a novel analogue of anti-depressant
imipramine that we recently synthesized inhibits FOXM1-associated signaling impeding DNA repair ability of
TNBCs and ER+BC. Using tumor explants from BC patients and tumor xenograft models, we have demonstrated
that IB inhibits the growth of TNBC and ER+BC without inducing any toxicity. Further, our studies have shown
that IB may sensitize endocrine resistant ER+BCs to tamoxifen (TAM) and improve the efficacy of DNA damaging
chemotherapy drugs in TNBC. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that FOXM1 is a critical component
of rescue DNA repair pathways that BCs get addicted to survive; that IB suppresses ER+BC and TNBC growth
and progression as well as enhances the therapy response by targeting FOXM1 and its associated signaling;
and that IB is a safe and effective drug for treating ER+BC and TNBC. In Aim 1, we will characterize the IB-target
protein interaction and determine the mechanism(s) by which IB regulates its target genes in TNBC and ER+BC.
In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that IB inhibits TNBC and ER+BCs growth, metastasis, and enhances therapy
response by inhibiting backup DNA repair pathways that these cancers employ to survive. In Aim 3, we will test
the safety and viability of IB by using patient derived xenografts in humanized mice and by using human breast
cancer explant studies. We will also establish PK/PD parameters required for future clinical development of IB."

In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that IB inhibits TNBC and ER+BCs growth, metastasis, and enhances therapy
response by inhibiting backup DNA repair pathways that these cancers employ to survive. In Aim 3, we will test
the safety and viability of IB by using patient derived xenografts in humanized mice and by using human breast
cancer explant studies. We will also establish PK/PD parameters required for future clinical development of IB."

Teleost fish have a natural capacity to regenerate lost retinal neurons. This is due to activation of endogenous
retinal stem cells, Müller Glia (MG), that undergo reprogramming and divide asymmetrically in response to
injury. In contrast, mammalian MG are reactive to retinal injury do not divide and replace lost cells in the
absence of exogenous stimulation. Prior research has successfully identified factors such as Achaete-scute
homolog 1 (ASCL1) and Lin-28 homologue A (LIN28A) as critical regulators of MG regenerative potential.
Intriguingly, mouse MG can be stimulated to divide by inducing expression changes in ASCL1 and treatment
with histone deacetylases, demonstrating that regenerative potential is intact. These studies almost exclusively
induce broad retinal damage prior to investigating regenerative potential. Much less is known about how retinal
regeneration is regulated following the loss of discrete cell-types that have clear disease relevance.
Selective retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration is implicated in several human diseases linked to vision
loss. Glaucoma, one example of disease caused by optic nerve damage, is the leading causing of irreversible
blindness in the world. To investigate RGC regeneration, we created a novel transgenic model enabling
selective RGC ablation in zebrafish. These fish co-express a bacterial enzyme Nitroreductase (NTR) and a
yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) reporter in RGCs. NTR converts prodrugs such as metronidazole (MTZ) into
DNA damage inducing agents, resulting in rapid targeted ablation of RGCs. Recently, we used the NTR-
prodrug ablation system to study rod photoreceptor regeneration. We identified a critical role for immune cells
in rod cell regeneration and concluded a neuroprotective drug screen. Using our new model, we propose to
identify novel factors regulating zebrafish RGC regeneration and compare function in regeneration-deficient
mouse models. I hypothesize that large-scale discovery in zebrafish will reveal novel cellular, molecular, and/or
genetic factors that regulate RGC regeneration, and that a subset of these factors will stimulate regenerative
responses in mice. Such insights may lead to transformative therapeutics for RGC degeneration diseases.
In addition to their regenerative competence, zebrafish are amenable to high-throughput screening (HTS), in
vivo imaging, and rapid genomic manipulation. We will take advantage of these strengths by characterizing our
regeneration model and determining key immune cell responders to RGC death (Aim 1), screening for drugs
that enhance regeneration or protect RGCs from cell death and testing hit drugs in complementary mouse
RGC degeneration models (Aim 2), and disrupting newly identified “regeneration-associated” genes for roles in
RGC regeneration (Aim 3). These aims, and the comprehensive research plan behind them, are aligned with
areas of emphasis articulated by the National Eye Institute (NEI): the emerging field of regeneration, the
immune system’s role in visual disease, and connecting disease-associated genes to mechanisms."

 Myocardial infarction (MI) due to underlying atherosclerosis is the leading disease
sequela that precipitates heart failure in the Western world. Our ability to treat these
patients and their heart failure has not progressed beyond a mild 20-30% extension in
life span realized some 3 decades ago with neuroendocrine-based management [1].
New therapeutic avenues are needed, the most dramatic of which would be directly
generating new cardiomyocyte to regenerate the damaged area of heart tissue.
Previous attempts to regenerate the heart through new myocyte production have not
been successful despite more than 18 years of research using adult progenitor cells.
However, studies with cardiac progenitor cells in rodent models did show a functional
benefit to the MI-injured heart, although we now understand that this is not due to
significant new myocyte production. Instead we and others have identified a novel
mechanism of benefit whereby injected progenitor cells have a rejuvenating effect on the
MI-injured heart through refinement of the immune response. Indeed, we have shown
that cell therapy injections that flank the recently injured area of the heart from ischemia-
reperfusion (7 days later) can optimize healing, reduce infarct area expansion and
augment scar borderzone physical properties (Vagnozzi et al., 2020, Nature). These
beneficial effects were mediated through selective macrophage subtype activity in the
heart, underscoring the importance of the immune response in cardiovascular health and
infarct healing and compensation. Here we propose the hypothesis that selective innate
immune response signaling pathways, and macrophage subtype polarization can be
exploited to help heal the heart. Our more specific hypothesis is that therapy has an
underlying protective component through Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in both
cardiomyocytes and macrophages, and this can be therapeutically exploited to polarize
the immune response for better healing. The specific aims are: AIM #1, To examine the
mechanism of innate immune signaling in the heart through TLR signaling. AIM #2, To
inducibly alter macrophage subtypes in the heart to reprogram the innate immune
response and healing dynamics by cell therapy. AIM #3, To determine how fibroblasts
communicate with macrophage subtypes in the post-MI injured heart to affect healing
dynamics by cell therapy. Such studies will be critical for examining how innate immune
signaling at the level of macrophages and cardiomyocytes impacts the heart during an
inflammatory injury response with the goal of modifying this response to benefit cardiac
healing in patients."
10754560,"Project Summary / Abstract
Normal skin function is thought to depend on sebaceous glands (SGs), which are paired appendages typically
associated with hair follicles. The main purpose of SGs is to secrete sebum, a lipid-rich substance that acts on
the skin to regulate barrier function and hydration, while possibly possessing anti-oxidant and anti-microbial
properties. Aberrant SGs have been associated with skin pathologies such as acne and scarring alopecia, but
their functional roles in disease remain unclear.
Although numerous genes and signaling pathways have been implicated in maintaining SGs, few studies have
characterized the mechanisms by which these factors modulate SG stem cell differentiation, and whether their
effects are direct or indirect. Our previous studies have found that Notch signaling simultaneously exerts dual
opposing effects on SGs: Whereas Notch directly promotes SG stem cell differentiation, this pathway also
indirectly suppresses SGs by regulating proper differentiation in the surface interfollicular epidermis. We
further observed that a PPARγ/K5 double-positive population likely serves as the immediate progenitors that
give rise to differentiated sebocytes in the gland.
This proposal seeks to identify some of the complex factors that regulate SG stem cells and to test the
requirement for SGs in maintaining normal skin function. In Aim 1, we will examine how Notch directly
promotes SG stem cell differentiation, and evaluate novel genes that may modulate SG function. In Aim 2, we
will determine how disruption of Notch-dependent epidermal differentiation causes SGs to enlarge. In Aim 3,
we will assess the consequences of deleting SGs throughout the skin. Altogether, these studies will
characterize how SG stem cells are regulated, both locally and from a distance, and potentially uncover novel
functions for these glands. These studies build upon the emerging concept that different cellular sub-
compartments in the skin are intricately linked and communicate with each other through a variety of signaling
cues."
10754569,"The BK channel (also known as Slo1) is almost ubiquitously expressed in the body with many important
physiological functions, such as regulating neurotransmitter release by acting at presynaptic sites of neurons.
Mutations of the channel may cause diverse diseases. Physiological functions of Slo1 depend to great degrees
on its expression level in the cell membrane and interactions with regulatory proteins. Genetic screen for mutants
that suppress a sluggish phenotype caused by a hyperactive Slo1 in C. elegans led to the identification of two
proteins required for Slo1 physiological functions in vivo, including a melatonin receptor and an ubiquitin E3
ligase. Electrophysiological and behavioral analyses indicate that Slo1 mediates melatonin’s sleep-promoting
effect in worms, and that Slo1’s physiological roles in regulating neurotransmitter release and sleep depend on
melatonin secretion and activation of the melatonin receptor. In a heterologous expression, human Slo1 is
activated by melatonin through the MT1 but not MT2 melatonin receptor. However, it remains to be determined
where Slo1 acts in the nervous system to regulate sleep in worms, and whether mammalian Slo1 in native
neurons may be also activated by melatonin through a specific melatonin receptor. Mass spectrometry analyses
identified a protein greatly increased in mutants of the E3 ligase compared with wild type. Mutations of the gene
encoding this protein led to increased Slo1 function, suggesting that it is a novel inhibitory regulator of Slo1, and
that the E3 ligase regulates Slo1 by facilitating degradation of this putative inhibitory regulator. Further studies
are needed to define a molecular pathway through which the E3 ligase regulates Slo1. This project is to
investigate 1) how the E3 ligase regulates Slo1 through the inhibitory regulator and other proteins; 2) where and
how Slo1 acts in the nervous system to regulate sleep in C. elegans; and 3) why MT1 but not MT2 may allow
Slo1 activation by melatonin in the heterologous expression system, and whether melatonin can also regulate
Slo1 in mouse brain through MT1 but not MT2. We will answer these questions using a combination of
electrophysiological, genetic, cellular, and molecular biological approaches. Results of the proposed studies are
expected to produce important new knowledge about how Slo1 interacts with other proteins to regulate cellular
excitability, neurotransmitter release, and behavior."
10752764,"Background: In the United States, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects 25-30% of adults and has
become a leading cause of chronic liver disease including cirrhosis and liver cancer. The burden of NAFLD and
its complications among patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is increasing. Most complications
occur among patients with advanced hepatic fibrosis. Treatment (e.g., weight loss) improves patients’ outcomes.
Significance: Our data indicate that most VA patients with NAFLD are undiagnosed and untreated. There is an
urgent need to address this major gap in care. Most people with NAFLD are seen in primary care settings. The
NAFLD Clinical Care Pathway (NCCP) is a multistep, algorithmic process that entails identification of patients at
risk through an e-trigger (Step 1), targeted history and lab testing (Step 2), noninvasive testing for hepatic fibrosis
using FIB-4 (Step 3), elective additional fibrosis testing with Fibroscan for those with indeterminate FIB-4 (Step
4), and subsequent recommended management. The NCCP has face and content validity based on consensus
of multiple stakeholders including VA clinicians, and high efficacy in our preliminary data. We propose to adapt
the multicomponent NCCP intervention for use in VA primary care and prospectively test its effectiveness for
identification and severity stratification of patients with NAFLD. Our approach is consistent with VA strategic
priorities to implement a more “Veteran-centered” approach that improves access to care.
Innovation & Impact: This is the first study to examine the effectiveness of any NAFLD clinical care pathway in
a VA primary care practice. The design is a cluster-randomized controlled trial with randomization at the level of
Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs) in primary care, and a state-of-the-art technique to diagnose NAFLD and
stage the severity of hepatic fibrosis. Our formative and summative evaluation will provide key information about
the feasibility, acceptability and determinants of implementation. The NCCP intervention is a paradigm shift in
NAFLD care from haphazard and sporadic care into a systematic, equitable, and evidence-based approach.
Specific Aims: Aim 1. Conduct a formative evaluation to assess feasibility and acceptability of the NCCP among
patients and providers; adapt the NCCP for prospective testing based on feedback. Aim 2. Examine the
effectiveness of the NCCP intervention compared to usual care in improving NAFLD care processes and patient
outcomes. Aim 3. Conduct a summative evaluation to identify patient and provider characteristics associated
with effectiveness of NCCP and to assess future implementation. Our hypothesis is that NCCP when adapted to
Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs) in VA primary care considerably increases the identification of patients
with NAFLD and those with high-risk NAFLD, and results in an increase in guideline-concordant management.
Methodology: The study will be conducted in primary care settings in a single large VA Medical Center. We will
conduct patient interviews and focus groups with PACTs to inform adaption of the NCCP. We will then conduct
a cluster-randomized trial of 16 PACTs in primary care to compare the effectiveness of NCCP to usual care in
improving NAFLD care, with PACTs as unit of randomization and patients as the unit of analysis. The
multicomponent intervention includes an e-trigger to identify patients eligible for NAFLD screening and calculate
fibrosis scores, a structured provider education on NAFLD management and treatment recommendations, and
coordination by an interprofessional team. The primary outcome will be a composite binary variable consisting
of NAFLD diagnosis and risk stratification. Secondary outcomes include referral to a weight loss program, referral
of patients with advanced fibrosis to hepatology specialty care, and enrollment among those referred to weight
loss and hepatology specialty care. Summative evaluation will inform future implementation.
Next Steps/Implementation: Our study will provide information needed to support future projects to implement
the NCCP in VA primary care settings. The study will also lay the foundation for a subsequent project to examine
the adopted intervention’s effect on weight loss and NAFLD biomarkers in patients with high-risk NAFLD."
10886126,"Project Summary. Fungal mediated disease progression is highlighted by populations of fungal cells that form
a community referred to as a biofilm. For therapeutic success, contemporary antifungal therapies must be
effective at the site of infection in the context of an established fungal biofilm. Critically, it is now clear that
emergent properties arise from fungal biofilms that directly alter virulence, disease progression, and antifungal
drug susceptibility. However, the mechanisms through which filamentous fungal biofilm emergent properties
impact virulence, disease progression, and antifungal susceptibility remain a significant knowledge gap. The
long-term goal of this project is focused on defining the molecular mechanisms of Aspergillus fumigatus biofilm
mediated disease progression mechanisms to inform contemporary and novel therapeutic approaches. In the
prior funding period, we made important progress that surprisingly revealed heterogeneity in A. fumigatus
biofilm morphology across clinical isolates. Differences in biofilm morphology altered virulence and disease
progression in vivo in murine models of aspergillosis. We discovered that long term growth in a low oxygen
environment gives rise to a biofilm morphology we termed H-MORPH and that a novel fungal specific gene
cluster that contains a protein with unknown function was sufficient for H-MOPRH formation. Significantly, we
identified H-MORPH clinical isolates from both acute invasive aspergillosis patients and patients with chronic
aspergillosis, suggesting H-MORPH can arise in human disease. We observed that H-MOPRH occurs in vivo
in a murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and contributes to worse disease outcomes compared to
the contrasting N-MORPH isolates. In aim 1, we will define the genetic pathway(s) that regulate A. fumigatus
the development of this unique population level morphotype utilizing the newly discovered biofilm architecture
factor (baf) gene family as a tool to dissect the underlying mechanisms. In aim 2, we will define the differences
in fungal metabolism that underly N-MORPH and H-MORPH morphotypes and test the hypothesis that H-
MORPH biofilms are carbon catabolite de-repressed which leads to increased fitness in vivo. In aim 3, we test
the hypothesis that H-MORPH strain metabolism is immune modulatory through alterations in fungal pathogen
associated molecular pattern exposure. Taken together, our proposed studies will fill significant knowledge
gaps related to the discovery of distinct A. fumigatus morphotypes that directly impact virulence. Advancing our
understanding of this knowledge gap is expected to lay the foundation for new diagnostic and therapeutic
strategies to combat highly virulent and drug resistant strains of this important human fungal pathogen."

We seek five years of funding to enhance diversity and accessibility at the Boston University Conference on
Language Development (BUCLD), which will take place at Boston University each year around the first
weekend in November.
Now in its 46th year, the BUCLD is internationally recognized as one of the most important annual meetings of
researchers in different areas of language acquisition and development, including first and second language
acquisition, language disorders, bilingualism, and literacy development. The meeting comprises oral
presentations and poster presentations selected through peer review, as well as invited keynote and plenary
speakers, a symposium on a topic of current interest, a NIH/NSF research funding workshop, a
professionalization workshop for students and postdocs, a pop-up mentoring program, and a sponsor exhibit.
The BUCLD serves as a prime venue for disseminating and inciting new scientific research; it brings together
researchers from all different areas of language development who do not typically interact or encounter each
other’s work regularly elsewhere, thus fostering substantial interaction across theoretical and disciplinary
boundaries. It also offers excellent training for students and postdocs, both in the form of access to high-quality
scholarship and in training activities such as the funding workshop.
In this proposal, we are requesting funds for student travel awards that will increase the quality, visibility,
interdisciplinary contribution, health relevance, and accessibility of the conference for students from
underrepresented populations, including women, racial/ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, and first-
generation college students. These student travel awards are a key piece not only for ensuring that the BUCLD
continues to be a high-quality venue for the above activities, but also for allowing the conference to grow in
important new directions that are demonstrated priorities for the scientific community as well as NIH."

Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and for the 1-2 % of treatment-resistant individuals with
a chronic, unremitting course, subcallosal cingulate (SCC) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an evolving
experimental strategy. Treatment responses to SCC DBS are highly variable across different clinical centers,
and objective standards are needed to help mitigate variable outcomes in future clinical trials. Connectomic DBS
modeling is one avenue that holds promise for standardizing and simplifying the administration of SCC DBS. The
pioneering work of the first 5 years of R01 MH102238 set the stage for a new era in DBS research, with the initial
identification of “connectomic targeting” for prospective surgical planning. Our novel approach to individualized
precision medicine has resulted in substantial improvements to SCC DBS' long-term outcomes, but this model-
based strategy was not available in its pivotal industry-sponsored trial, which suffered from suboptimal outcomes.
Nonetheless, multiple groups continue to develop SCC DBS. The clinical trial at Mt. Sinai (UH3 NS103550) is
combining neuroimaging and electrophysiology to optimize DBS for depression, and this proposal augments that
effort, while leveraging the unique clinical datasets associated with its subjects. Our working hypothesis is that
forceps minor and the cingulum bundle are the most probable therapeutic targets of SCC DBS. The overall
objective of this proposal is therefore to test that connectomic hypothesis with computational rigor and
electrophysiological validation. The first aim will develop a standard biophysical connectome that can be used
for customization and optimization of parameters in de novo subjects based on connectomic hypotheses. Results
from this aim will be fundamental for processing connectomic DBS strategies within standard clinical workflows
and applying SCC DBS technology on a larger scale. The second aim will refine the SCC DBS biophysical
connectome using high-density EEG collected monthly as part of a standard research protocol at Mt. Sinai, and
then we will use the connectomic model to delineate specific bioelectric scalp signatures for activation of forceps
minor and at least one cingulum bundle. The third aim will evaluate theoretically optimal directional and current-
steering strategies for SCC DBS in two use cases, energy-optimization and isolated/focal target activation. The
proposal's outcome will be a validated set of computational tools that can be used for near real-time parameter
customization and optimization in SCC DBS. Individualized, deployable model-based strategies for precision
DBS are significant because they have a realistic opportunity to simplify the process of parameter selection and
help make device programming more objective, and less variable, in future studies of SCC DBS."

 Multiple cases of MEHMO syndrome, an X-linked intellectual disability syndrome
caused by mutations in EIF2S3 that encodes a core member of the cellular protein synthesis
machinery, have recently been identified. However, the causal links between mis-regulated
protein synthesis and human disease remain poorly understood. EIF2S3 encodes the γ subunit of
translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2γ) that, along with the eIF2 α and β subunits, GTP, and the
initiator Met-tRNAiMet, plays a critical role in selection of the translation start site. Thus, patients
with MEHMO syndrome are likely to experience changes in protein synthesis on both a global
and gene specific level. The acronym MEHMO denotes the symptoms of this syndrome: Mental
deficiency, Epilepsy, Hypogenitalism, Microcephaly, and Obesity. How changes in gene
expression incurred through mutations in eIF2γ result in the presentation of MEHMO syndrome
remains unknown. Thus, there is a critical need to determine the underlying molecular
mechanism governing the phenotype and symptoms of MEHMO patients. The long-term goal of
these studies is to identify key factors and gene expression changes that underlie MEHMO
syndrome in order to develop improved strategies for treating patients. The overall objective in
this application is to determine how mis-regulation of protein synthesis contributes to the
symptoms of MEHMO syndrome. In Aim 1 ribosome profiling, an informatics-based, genome-
wide approach, and additional validation techniques will be used to identify mRNAs subject to
changes in start codon selection and translational efficiency in MEHMO-patient derived iPSCs
expressing mutant eIF2γ or isogenic iPSCs expressing wild-type eIF2g. In Aim 2 wild-type and
eIF2γ mutant iPSCs will be differentiated into neurons that will be utilized in multidisciplinary
analyses, including electrophysiological readings, immunohistochemistry, and ribosome
profiling, geared toward understanding changes in neuronal biology and function caused by the
eIF2γ mutation. In Aim 3 CRISPR Cas9 genome editing will be used to generate isogenic iPSCs
with Vanishing White Matter disease-causing eIF2B mutations. Generation of eIF2B mutant
iPSCs from the isogenic wild-type control iPSCs utilized in Aim 1 will enable direct comparisons
of the protein synthesis changes caused by mutations in eIF2γ and its guanine-nucleotide
exchange factor eIF2B. These studies will enhance our understanding of how translation is mis-
regulated by alterations in eIF2 function, and ultimately provide critical knowledge for the
development of targeted strategies for the treatment of patients with MEHMO syndrome."
10913638,"Summary
Critical periods are time windows during development when experience-dependent plasticity is most robust.
The developing visual system in the premier model for studying how circuits modified by experience-dependent
plasticity are consolidated when a critical period closes. This model is clinically relevant because the closure of
the visual critical period is implicated in the pathophysiology of amblyopia, a childhood visual disorder
characterized by deficits in spatial vision including poor visual acuity and impaired depth perception. Effective
therapy is more difficult after the critical period closes because the brain is less plastic. In animal models of
amblyopia, monocular deprivation (MD) causes lasting deficits in ocular dominance (OD), binocular depth
perception, and visual acuity. The closure of the critical period is coincident with the maturation of perineuronal
nets in visual cortex, but how these extracellular structures may limit plasticity is not understood.
 In the proposed research, we will determine the role and cellular source of aggrecan, a principal
component of perineuronal nets, in closing the developmental critical period for plasticity in visual circuits. Our
hypothesis is that aggrecan operates outside of perineuronal nets to close the critical period. We will use a
combination of behavioral assays of vision, multi-unit electrophysiology, calcium imaging in vivo, and slice
electrophysiology in vitro, and genetic manipulations to determine how aggrecan regulates the plasticity of visual
circuits. This project will improve understanding of the mechanisms by which experience-dependent plasticity is
restricted in the maturing brain and may reveal new avenues for developing therapeutic approaches to treat
developmental visual disorders such as amblyopia and central visual impairment."

Problems with pain, sleep, and mood are common among individuals diagnosed with cancer (i.e., cancer
survivors/patients), and many are turning to cannabis for symptom relief/palliative care. Recent reviews of the
literature suggest that cannabis use can indeed provide benefit for symptoms including pain interference, pain
intensity, and aspects of mood disturbance (i.e., anxiety). Cannabis may also prove less harmful/more
beneficial than other palliative care options like opiate medications, and may reduce the use of multiple
drugs (i.e., polypharmacy). Despite these promising benefits, it is also important to consider the potential
negative effects cancer patients may experience from cannabis use, including compromised cognitive function.
Research clearly demonstrates that cannabis compromises objective functioning immediately after use,
but there is mixed evidence regarding its effects long-term. This equivocation may be due to cannabinoid
content as the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is associated
with memory and other cognitive impairment, but cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid, may
attenuate these negative effects. Such effects are especially important to consider among cancer patients who
are particularly vulnerable to cognitive deficits. Differential effectiveness of CBD versus THC versus a
combination is also evident for outcomes of sleep disturbance, anxiety, and pain. Overall, as cannabis
continues to become legally available across the US and cancer patients look to cannabis for relief, more
studies are needed to better determine the efficacy of cannabis use, the role of different cannabinoid ratios,
and what side effects may arise from its use. Existing research examines synthetic cannabinoids which are
chemically homogenous and THC/CBD isolates which are unrepresentative of the whole-plant products that
are now widely available in the United States. As such, it is increasingly necessary to conduct rigorous
experimental research using more ecologically valid forms of cannabis among cancer patients. The present
proposal seeks to utilize a rigorous placebo-controlled randomized trial to understand the effects of full
spectrum hemp-derived CBD (fsCBD; CBD that contains a small amount of THC) and broad spectrum hemp-
derived CBD (bsCBD; CBD that contains no THC) versus placebo on measures of sleep, pain, mood
disturbance, subjective and objective cognitive functioning, and quality of life. These CBD products can be
legally purchased and used over the counter across the U.S., so the results of this study have immediate
application to and importance for cancer patients and their clinicians. The project aims are to 1) compare the
effects of fsCBD vs bsCBD vs placebo on sleep quality, pain intensity/interference, mood disturbance (anxiety,
depression), cognitive functioning, and quality of life over 8 weeks of sustained use and 2) compare the acute
effects of fsCBD vs bsCBD vs placebo one and two hours after use on pain intensity, current mood, and
objective cognitive task performance."

 Genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections in pregnancy pose a risk for perinatal transmission of the
virus to neonates, and HSV infections in the newborns are associated with severe morbidity and mortality. A
standard treatment of HSV infections with nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir does not eliminate
asymptomatic viral shedding and is ineffective against acyclovir-resistant HSV strains. Amenamevir and
pritelivir, the helicase-primase inhibitors, represent novel antiherpesviral medications that were developed to
circumvent the limitations of the nucleoside analogs. Both novel drugs completed Phase II clinical trials in
treatment of genital herpes in men and nonpregnant women and demonstrated superiority over placebo and
standard treatments. While amenamevir is currently indicated for the treatment of herpes zoster in Japan,
pritelivir received an FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation and has entered a Phase III clinical trial.
Pregnant women infected with genital herpes could benefit from amenamevir and pritelivir in suppressive or
episodic treatments to prevent the transmission of HSV to neonates. The first step to determine the potential
use of the novel drugs in pregnancy is to obtain preclinical data on their placental biodisposition.
The focus of the proposed investigation is to determine the biodisposition of amenamevir and pritelivir by
human placenta using ex vivo and in vitro experimental models. Meanwhile, assessing fetal safety for
amenamevir and pritelivir, as well as their effect on placental function, is imperative in clinical development of
these novel drugs for their potential use in pregnancy. While existing data from toxicity studies in animal
models suggest a favorable reproductive and developmental safety profile for amenamevir, assessment of
potential developmental hazards of pritelivir remains to be conducted. The specific aims are to
 1) Determine the extent of bidirectional transfer of amenamevir and pritelivir across term human placenta
 ex vivo, the distribution of these drugs in the placental tissue and maternal and fetal circuits, and their
 effect on placental viability and functional parameters;
 2) Determine the role of placental efflux membrane transporters in the placental disposition of amenamevir
 and pritelivir; and
 3) Determine potential embryo-fetal developmental toxicity of pritelivir in mice.
 This work will provide the preclinical data needed to determine potential use of amenamevir and pritelivir in
the treatment of newly acquired and reactivated genital herpes in pregnancy as well as in HSV suppressive
therapy during pregnancy. Amenamevir and pritelivir could be effective alternative treatments to manage
genital herpes in pregnancy to reduce the risk of mother-to-neonate HSV transmission in women with
asymptomatic presentation of genital herpes at the time of delivery and for those with inadequate response to
standard treatment with nucleoside analogs."

Understanding cellular function is intimately linked with the ability to visualize organelle ultrastructure with
molecular specificity and to observe how it is altered in diseases such as cancer, neurological disease,
ciliopathies and microbial pathogenesis. Super-resolution microscopy (SRM) has potential here as it bridges
the gap between light and electron microscopy and provides molecular specificity. However, SRM mostly offers
only a few color channels. This prohibits a comprehensive architectural map of organelles, as many are
pleomorphic and exist in multiple states depending on intra- and extracellular cues, making the combination of
datasets, each showing different subsets of labels, difficult. The SRM technique of DNA-PAINT allows, in
principle, powerful multiplexing to image 10 or more labels in one sample, but hurdles in speed, cost and ease
of use have limited its application. What is needed is a highly versatile multiplexing strategy to enable SRM of
organelles with an order-of-magnitude improvement in four key areas: acquisition speed, switching between
multiplex probe sets, spatial resolution, and cost. This requires new probes, instrumentation, enhanced
analysis, and biological validation. We will approach these tasks through three Specific Aims: 1) the
development of new versatile, DNA-PAINT probes that are both fluorogenic and provide a fast, adaptable,
low-cost framework for multiplexing, 2) a new platform for automated acquisition of multiplex DNA-PAINT data
and analytics to ‘connect the dots’ of single-molecule localization points in three dimensions and thereby create
membrane representations of organelles, and 3) the development of multiplexed DNA-PAINT ‘organelle
modules’ to validate this technology under realistic biological conditions and lower the entrance hurdle for
future biological users. Achieving these aims and their concrete deliverables will have a wide impact on the use
and accessibility of SRM to accelerate biological discovery."
10914258,"From the previous R01 funding period we have generated compelling new evidence that human Heparanase-1
(HPSE), a heparan sulfate (HS) endoglycosidase, is a virulence factor responsible for triggering angiogenesis
and inflammation in the eye during herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) infection. Our in vivo studies have shown
that HPSE presence can significantly increase HSV-1 replication and severity of ocular disease with poor
prognosis. Investigation of transcriptional and proteomic landscapes revealed a multitude of non-enzymatic roles
for HPSE during HSV-1 infection and identified new druggable targets. Upon further investigation, we found that
the significance of HPSE in corneal infection may not be limited to promoting viral pathogenesis only, but also in
the induction of inflammatory cell death in a protein kinase B (Akt) dependent manner. Making things even more
interesting and potentially more significant, our new preliminary data suggests that HPSE and Akt2 isoform
phenocopy each other both in inflammatory cell death and deficiency in virus production. Therefore, based on
our published observations of HPSE’s non-enzymatic roles and preliminary results, we hypothesize an important,
yet interconnected regulatory role for HPSE and Akt2 in HSV-1 mediated ocular inflammation, nerve damage,
and the resultant vision loss. We propose that their inhibition through small molecules can reduce disease
severity and viral replication in the eye and reduce the incidences of viral encephalitis. This proposal will focus
on understanding HPSE driven inflammatory cell death mechanisms and the role for Akt2 during HSV-1
replication, spread and disease pathology in the cornea. Successful completion of our studies will identify new
and more effective HPSE and Akt2 inhibitors that can reduce inflammation as well as virus load without causing
any adverse effects. Results generated through the proposed experiments will be broadly relevant, as aberrant
HPSE activity has been implicated in a wide array of ocular pathologies and other neurodegenerative diseases
and disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s Disease."

Multiple arrhythmia conditions manifest in the heart due to conduction disorder, a failure of conduction between
local islands of cardiomyocytes that are separated physically by millimeter (mm) to centimeter (cm) distances
of non- or poorly conductive tissue. While electronic devices such as implantable cardioverter-defibrillators
provide life-saving support for patients, their complications and lack of biological integration for long-term
conduction restoration limit their success. A novel therapeutic approach is to provide cell-based physical
connections between electrically active cardiomyocytes that could resynchronize cardiac electrophysiology to
reduce arrhythmia risk and promote efficient cardiac pumping. Our long-term goal is to re-engineer
electromechanical function of diseased hearts and specifically to address the critical need in clinical cardiac
electrophysiology practice for long-lasting, anatomical electrical connections with biological responsiveness
between disparate islands of cardiomyocytes in the heart. The objective of this proposal is to explore efficacy

confluent layer of cardiomyocytes along microthreads will create an electrical bridge via cellular gap junctions
with known conduction velocity, and that this bioelectric cell bridge will be established within one week to
enable electrophysiological synchronization and ameliorate conduction problems. Our preliminary data show
that hiPSC-CM conduction along microthreads transmits action potential signals and calcium transients across
at least 1.5 cm at 2.7 cm/s conduction velocity between two engineered cardiac tissues within 1 day in vitro.
We propose to advance the biomanufacturing of bioelectric threads using 3D bioprinting and develop an
injection-based device for precise implantation in the heart in Aim 1. We will assess our hypotheses in Aim 2
by evaluating electrical coupling and efficacy of cardiac synchrony in two different models of conduction
anomalies after implantation of bioelectric threads. The parallel aims develop critically important technologies
in tissue engineering to advance regeneration of cardiac conduction. The development of novel therapies for
durable, biologically responsive conduction is significant because failure of current approaches in patients are
associated with increased arrhythmia and mortality risk, necessitating novel solutions. This project is innovative
in its use of 3D bioprinting for biomanufacturing of bioelectric threads, development of a delivery system for
precise local implant in the heart, and evaluation of efficacy in diverse models of conduction disorder. The
successful development of this technology requires investment in this early phase, and in doing so, it is likely
that bioelectric threads will move the field of cardiac conduction repair into a new era, where regeneration of
native-like anatomy and function becomes an attractive strategy for patients with cardiac conduction defects."
10753879,"The overall goal of this proposal is to conduct a fully powered randomized controlled trial of a multi-component
intervention designed to provide education about brain aging, improve feelings of control over brain aging, and
deliver practical assistance with creation of an executable action plan (AgeWISE-Action Plan). The AgeWISE-
Action Plan (AgeWISE-AP) is intended to extend our prior AgeWISE program by adding an individualized
action plan component to increase older Veteran engagement in brain healthy lifestyle activities.
AIM 1 (primary): To determine whether AgeWISE-AP increases older Veterans’ engagement in lifestyle
factors that promote brain health. AgeWISE provides information about the differences between normal and
diseased brain aging and lifestyle factors that contribute to brain health. The action plan (AP) component will
use this foundation to collaboratively create an individualized brain health plan to increase Veteran
engagement in brain healthy lifestyle activities. H1. AgeWISE-AP participants will demonstrate increased
engagement in brain-healthy lifestyle activities compared to the control group.
AIM 2 (primary): To determine whether AgeWISE-AP improves psychological wellness. AgeWISE
provides information about the relationship between cognitive aging and affective states (e.g., depression) and
attitudes about aging, and teaches stress reduction techniques. The action plan (AP) will provide additional
individualized supports to improve psychological well-being with personalized goals and lifestyle modifications
(e.g., diet, exercise, sleep, cognitive stimulation). H2. AgeWISE-AP participants will show increases in
perception of control over cognitive aging, meaning and purpose in life, quality of life, and self-efficacy, as well
as improved attitudes toward aging and decreased loneliness, depression, and anxiety compared to the control
group.
AIM 3 (primary): To determine whether AgeWISE-AP improves cognition. Cognitive strategies to improve
cognition and functioning are presented and practiced over three AgeWISE sessions, with homework to
improve generalization to day-to-day life. Engagement in brain-healthy lifestyle activities will be accomplished
through the action plan (AP). H3. Self-reported memory contentment, ability, and compensatory strategy use
will increase and objective cognitive testing will be better for AgeWISE-AP participants compared to the control
group.
Aim 4 (exploratory): To determine whether AgeWISE-AP influences biomarkers of brain health using
structural neuroimaging methods. H4. At one-year follow-up AgeWISE-AP participants will have less
volumetric decline in dementia-related brain regions compared to the control group."

 The pathogenic Neisseria are obligate human pathogens that rely on several antigenic variation systems
to colonize and cause disease in the human population. This proposal will further our studies into the molecular
mechanisms for pilin antigenic variation in Neisseria gonorrhoeae. High-frequency gene conversion reactions
mediate extensive changes in the pilin amino acid sequence with segmental recombination between one of 18
silent pilin copies and the single expressed pilin gene. Over the tenure of this grant, we have (1) identified most
of the proteins involved in this process, (2) demonstrated that the pathogenic Neisseria carry diploid
chromosomes that may facilitate gene conversion, (3) shown that the formation of an alternative DNA structure
called a guanine quartet (G4) is necessary for pilin antigenic variation, (4) shown that transcription of a small
RNA within the G4 is necessary for pilin antigenic variation, and (5) that the small RNA forms an RNA-DNA
duplex (an R-loop). We will determine how new pilin variants replace the previous ones during pilin antigenic
variation. We will test the hypothesis that the G4 structure and associated R-loop initiate gene conversion by
altering chromosomal DNA replication. We will define how gene conversion occurs by applying various
approaches to determine the steps between the initiation of the process and the creation of the final variant
pilins by defining the molecules created and the effect of specific mutants on the generation of different
intermediate molecules. Finally, we will test whether the N. gonorrhoeae diploid chromosomes are involved in
gene conversion. The results of these cutting-edge studies will significantly impact the analysis of (1) Neisserial
pathogenesis, (2) mechanisms of antigenic variation in Neisseria and other bacterial gene conversion
mechanisms, and (4) the way programmed recombination is used in many cell types to alter gene expression
or content. These studies will move all these fields forward and continue pilin antigenic variation as a model for
diversity generation systems that use DNA recombination."

proposed Pacific Center for Genome Research (PCGR) aimed at capitalizing on the infrastructure at the
University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) and the racial/ethnic diversity of its catchment area to conduct genomic
research addressing the racial/ethnic differences in disease risks and outcomes that exist in Hawai`i and the
Pacific. The Administrative Core will build upon a number of institutional resources, both administrative and
scientific, to foster the implementation and coordination of the research in this U54. This Core will also closely
coordinate the U54 resource-building and career-development activities with those implemented by UHM, so
greater efficiency is achieved at the institutional level. Thus, this Core serves major administrative and integrative
functions for the grant. The U54 will rely on an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), consisting of key senior
scientists on genome research, to receive input on research opportunities and to facilitate coordination with
potentially synergistic local initiatives. The program will also benefit from the input of a Community Advisory
Board (CAB) composed of community leaders and patient advocates with experience in disease disparities
and/or survivorship, and who will advise on the responsiveness of our activities to community needs and
expectations. Program evaluation will heavily rely on the input of an External Advisory Board (EAB) composed
of outside investigators who are leaders in genome research. Specific Aim 1 will be to organize, integrate, and
provide administrative management of all Projects and Cores. Specific Aim 2 will be to provide project
management oversight to track milestones and timelines of the individual Projects and Cores. Specific Aim 3
will be to facilitate collaborations. The Administrative Core will play an essential role in supporting the research

Research (PCGR) has a long-term goal to ensure the Center’s consideration of equity and
ethics in the examination of genetic and other risk factors across the underserved and ethnic
minority groups including Native Hawaiians (NHs), Africans, Latinos, Europeans, and Asians,
served by this proposal. Additionally, the CEC will develop resources to support genetic
education and training for students, medical providers, and the broader community, including
the medically underserved communities identified for investigation. We will work closely with our
Genomic Workforce Development Core and the Administrative Core to build a repository of
resources for use in various formats to support the Center’s training and educational activities.
Additionally, we will hold annual workshops and seminars to build awareness of the implications
of genomic research in partnership with the community-based organizations working with these
underserved groups. The first aim of the CEC is to Provide clinical and community stakeholder
input and oversight for Project 1 objectives to use data from the Population Architecture using
the Genomics and Epidemiology Consortium, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, the
Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy, INTERVAL, Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities, UK Biobank, and Framingham Heart Study to develop genetic prediction models
to identify causally relevant biomarkers for risks of multiple diseases across African, Latino,
Asian, European, and NH groups and understand marker-risk factor interaction effects on
disease risks. The second aim is to provide clinical and community stakeholder input and
oversight for Project 2 objectives to characterize the genomic landscape, perform epigenomic
profiling and identify genomic risk factors for lung cancer in NHs by comparing them with the
genomics and epigenomics data from other ethnic groups. The final aim of the CEC is to
support student, stakeholder, and community education and awareness of the U54 PCGR. To
achieve these aims, the CEC will convene Community Advisory Boards to support the
promotion and education about the two U54 PCGR projects among physicians, content experts,
and community stakeholders. The CEC will also develop and implement a regular series of
community seminars and workshops to disseminate U54 PCGR and external genome research
leaders’ scientific findings and identify strategies for implementing risk identification methods in
clinical settings. As a result, the CEC will contribute y to the success of the U54 PCGR projects
and provide an optimal foundation for future genomic research at the University of Hawaii."
10930085,"ABSTRACT
A variety of human disease show disparities across different populations and ethnic groups, such as Africans,
Hispanics/Latinos, Asians, Europeans, and Native Hawaiians. The etiology of many human diseases is not fully
understood, despite substantial efforts to identify associated non-genetic and genetic factors, including common
and rare genetic variants. More work focusing on different layers of omic markers including DNA methylation
(DNAm), gene, protein, and metabolite markers is urgently needed. Basic research supports the important roles
of certain CpG sites, genes, proteins, and metabolites in development of many diseases. Epidemiological studies
also have identified multiple candidate DNAm, gene, protein, and metabolite biomarkers for diseases/traits.
However, conventional epidemiologic studies were conducted primarily in individuals with European ancestry,
and it is unclear which DNAm/gene/protein/metabolite biomarkers identified to date are European ancestry-
specific or pan-ancestry. Also, findings with many of these biomarkers have been inconsistent, potentially due
to major methodological limitations, such as selection bias and uncontrolled confounding. There are critical
needs to apply a novel study design with reduced limitations of conventional biomarker studies for characterizing
causally related biomarkers in blood for human diseases across populations to improve our understanding of
disease etiology and reduce health disparities. One strategy to potentially decrease limitations of selection bias
and unmeasured confounding is to use genetic instruments for assessing the relationship between
DNAm/gene/protein/metabolite markers and diseases. Our preliminary work applying conventional methods to
develop genetic prediction models has revealed promising DNAm, gene, protein, and metabolite biomarkers in
blood associated with risk of several diseases in Europeans. The proposed project will apply a series of new
studies to address these important knowledge gaps. Specifically, we will 1) develop ethnic-specific DNAm, gene,
protein, and metabolite marker genetic prediction models in blood tissue across African Americans,
Hispanics/Latinos, Asian Americans, European Americans, and Native Hawaiians by applying novel methods
(Aim 1); 2) identify putative causal DNAm, gene, protein, and metabolite biomarkers in blood for risk of multiple
diseases across multi-ethnic populations by leveraging large scale genetic and non-genetic data (Aim 2); and 3)
evaluate potential interactions between known risk factors and predicted levels of established and newly
identified markers on risks of diseases of interest (Aim 3). Our study will generate important new knowledge for
substantially improving our understanding of the etiology of multiple human diseases across Africans,
Hispanics/Latinos, Asians, Europeans, and Native Hawaiians. The proposed new methods can also be applied
to other omic markers."
10930087,"Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the United States and the leading cause of cancer-related
deaths. Significant disparities in incidence and outcome of lung cancer characterize the disease’s
manifestation among ethnically and racially diverse populations. It has been found that Native Hawaiians (NH),
Pacific Islanders (PI), and African Americans (AA) have the highest lung cancer risk and poorest survival
outcomes compared to other populations. The influence of race and ethnicity is more evident at relatively low
levels of smoking. After accounting for known lung cancer risk factors, NH and AAs remain at highest risk of
lung cancer.
 The cause of these significant lung cancer health disparities is undoubtedly multifactorial. However, an
unexplored factor is the molecular profiles of tumors arising in the NH/PI communities. In the past decade,
large-scale lung cancer genomic studies have found clear racial disparity for lung cancer driver mutation genes.
However, NHs have been strikingly underrepresented in The Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) and other
cancer genome projects. There are almost no NH lung cancer patients included in the previous projects. There
have also been no studies to compare DNA methylation changes between tumor and adjacent normal samples
from NH/PI lung cancer patients, despite the importance of understanding how DNA methylation changes
contribute to NH lung cancer development. To address the critical gap in lung cancer genomics studies and to
understand the key factors that contribute to the health disparity of NH/PI lung cancer patients, we propose the
following aims: 1. Characterize genomic landscape of lung cancer in NH patients. 2. Perform epigenomic
profiling of lung cancer tissues in NH patients. 3. Identify NH specific genomic and epigenomic risk factors of
lung cancer by comparing the profiles from NH with the published genomic and epigenomic data from other
racial/ethnic populations. This project has the potential to be translated into improved lung cancer screening,
precision prevention, and therapeutic intervention in NH and other populations. This project will also help us,
via the Genomic Workforce Development Core included in the overall proposal, to train students, researchers,
and community workers with genomics and genomic data science skills, such as whole genome sequencing
(WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES), Illumina DNA methylation microarray, and whole-genome bisulfite
sequencing (WGBS), as well as bioinformatics and data science skills related to the data analyses. The utility
of these fundamental genomic technologies, is very useful for conducting biomedical research in any human
diseases."
10899601,"Project Summary/Abstract
Antibiotics in the b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitor (BLBLI) class are among the mainstays of antimicrobial
treatment for gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Until recently, all b-
lactamase inhibitors in these combinations were themselves b-lactam compounds that lacked direct antimicrobial
activity. However, bacteria are increasingly developing resistance to all currently available BLBLIs. To address
this problem, new combinations are being developed that incorporate novel diazabicyclooctane (DBO) b-
lactamase inhibitors, which are non-b-lactam compounds that possess intrinsic direct antimicrobial activity
mediated by binding to penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2). While the expanded spectrum of these new
combinations is promising, the highly multidrug-resistant bacteria they will be used to treat are prone to the
development of additional resistance mechanisms, and PBP2-mediated antibacterial activity in particular is
known to be vulnerable to the emergence of resistance during treatment. The overall goal of this project is to
characterize the development of resistance to novel DBO-containing BLBLIs in order to discover how best to
make use of them while preventing the emergence of resistance. In Aim #1, rates of resistance to DBO-
containing BLBLIs will be assessed among a large, diverse collection of gram-negative bacterial strains including
E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae complex, and P. aeruginosa. In Aim #2, mechanisms of
resistance to these agents will be investigated using two different ‘omics approaches. First, whole genome
sequencing will be used to identify mutations in strains in which resistance has developed. Second, gene
expression profiling using RNA-Seq will be employed to investigate the transcriptomic response of both
susceptible and resistant bacteria to DBO-containing BLBLI treatment. The goal of Aim #3 is to understand how
to prevent resistance to DBO-containing BLBLIs in models that better simulate in vivo treatment conditions. A
time-kill assay, a hollow-fiber infection model, which allows for simulation of changing antibiotic concentrations
over time, and a mouse thigh infection model will be employed to identify combinations that prevent resistance
over longer periods of drug exposure, and whole genome sequencing of resistant isolates will be used to
compare resistance-conferring mutations that occur in these models to those observed in standard in vitro
assays. The proposed project, when completed, will provide a guide to the most effective ways to utilize novel
DBO-containing BLBLIs in order to effectively treat patients with MDR infections while preventing the emergence
of resistance."

Human milk provides significant health benefits for infants. Beyond nutrients, breastmilk contains antibodies for
immunity, growth factors associated with gut epithelial maturation, bacteria for establishment of the gut
microbiome, and metabolites that modulate inflammation. These important elements of human milk support
strong immune system development within the infant gut and better infant health. Unfortunately, many parents
aiming to breastfeed will supplement or wean earlier than planned and frequently report perceived low milk
supply as the reason. Increased mammary epithelium permeability (IMEP), as indicated by elevated milk
sodium, is a physiologic condition that could have significant implications for milk secretion, composition and
infant health. Lactation physiology studies have established that closed paracellular pathways, i.e., low
permeability, are essential for the establishment and maintenance of adequate milk secretion. Human studies
on permeability have focused on the period of secretory activation and persistent mammary epithelium
permeability at day 7 postpartum has been associated with perceived low milk supply. However, little is known
about IMEP during established lactation. We recently reported that IMEP among US women is more common
across lactation than previously recognized. Longitudinal US studies are needed to quantify mammary
epithelium permeability during established lactation and to investigate the extent to which increased
permeability influences lactation insufficiency. Our overall goal is to establish a clinically relevant robust
IMEP threshold, based on our analysis of sodium as a continuous variable, and determine the extent to
which IMEP is associated with suboptimal lactation outcomes and reduced infant health. We propose
that IMEP is associated with low milk supply and earlier than desired weaning. We also posit that IMEP results
in altered milk nutrient content, shifted inflammatory profiles and milk microbiome composition impacting the
infant gut immune profile and microbiome. We will enroll a diverse cohort of 400 mother-infant dyads from New
Mexico and Massachusetts. Participants will provide bilateral milk and infant fecal samples at four timepoints
spanning transitional, early and mature milk. Understanding the extent of IMEP linkage to suboptimal lactation
outcomes and infant intestinal health is of major importance because IMEP can be measured, treated and
prevented. Interventions to limit IMEP could include behavioral and dietary changes, as well as medications or
supplements. This will be the first study to determine the prevalence of IMEP and associated changes in milk
throughout the first five months postpartum, and the only large US cohort study of IMEP. Results from this
study could lead to a major change in clinical practice. Assessment of IMEP in milk could become routine,
especially among women seeking lactation counseling, and this may lead to improved outcomes. We expect
that our geographically and ethnically diverse cohorts will provide novel data on differences in risk factors for
IMEP with implications for lactation outcomes."

In this proposal, we will leverage our laboratory’s extensive expertise and experience in National Institutes of
Health (NIH) observational studies and provide kit management, specimen management, study management,
routine diagnostic testing, and specialty renal biomarker testing for the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children
(CKiD) study. The University of Minnesota’s Advanced Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (ARDL) has
become a trusted resource for clinical trial testing. Here we emphasize our ability to perform accurate and
precise iohexol measurements using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to allow
for gold standard measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) determinations in CKiD subjects. This and
routine diagnostic testing is instrumental in understanding the relationships of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to
neurocognitive development, behavior development, social development, and cardiovascular disease risk.
CKiD investigators previously developed the CKiD under 25 (U25) equation to estimate GFR (eGFR) since
adult eGFR equations do not perform well in this young demographic. Our specific aims are (Aim 1) to analyze
specimens undergoing the CKiD iohexol mGFR protocol for adolescents in the 14-17 years of age via new
recruitment to better validate and possibly improve upon the U25 eGFR equation accuracy. We are
approaching this with the hypothesis that when incorporating a larger pediatric population with mGFR results
into the U25 eGFR equation, specifically in the emerging adult population where data is sparse, the accuracy
of the U25 eGFR equation will be tested, validated, and potentially improved should the U25 equation model
need adjustment. Aim 2 involves acquiring mGFR results and specimens from a healthy young adult kidney
donor population at M Health Fairview to evaluate the U25 equation. Our hypothesis is since the current U25
equation was primarily generated from a CKD pediatric population, by evaluating young healthy patients with
this equation, the study will examine U25 equation continuity in all patients or it will assist in formulating a new
model that provides a better estimate of GFR in healthy and diseased pediatric populations. Lastly, Aim 3 sets
out to analyze routine and novel biomarkers to assess clinical interpretation and their relation to eGFR,
cardiovascular risk, social/behavioral development, and CKD progression. Our hypothesis is that biomarkers
such as creatinine and cystatin C will be input into the U25 equation and the results will allow for following CKD
progression. Biomarkers T50 and FGF23 will assist investigators in evaluating cardiovascular health in
subjects ≥14 years old with CKD at stages 4-5"
10753546,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), the gut microbiome demonstrates reduced species diversity that can
then be reversed following FMT. However, no study has identified a common pattern of microbiome alteration
that is causally related to IBD nor has any study elucidated the mechanisms underlying FMT success in the
subset of individuals with IBD that respond. In FMT, both species and strain diversity are increasing but
currently studies only track changes in species diversity, resulting in a fundamental feature of the microbiome
that is changing but not measured in trials or in cross sectional studies of comparing with healthy and IBD
microbiomes. Thus, it is unclear whether it is the increase in species or strain diversity that is critical to FMT
success or if there are unique differences in the strain-level structure of the IBD microbiome. Since microbial
functional variation is found at the strain level, a functional understanding of microbiome composition in IBD
may lie at the strain level. However, no studies so far have systematically characterized the strain-level
microbiome structure in health or disease. This proposal aims to define strain count—the number of unique
strains each bacterial species stably maintains in an individual—in healthy and IBD microbiomes and to further
investigate the functional impact of strain count in disease. We will quantify strain count by employing a high-
throughput culturing technique to isolate and sequence thousands of gut bacterial isolates for all culturable
species in a breadth-focused manner and validate our breadth-focused quantifications by using a depth-
focused approach to intensely sequence more genomes from ten of the most common gut species. For our
depth-sequencing, we will use gnotobiotic mice fed different diets to enrich for low abundance strains. This
experimental approach allows us to increase the efficiency by which we capture the strains of a particular
species and achieve a more accurate quantification of strain count. Aim 1—Based on our preliminary findings,
we anticipate that there is a limited number of strains each species can maintain in the gut microbiota and that
our method sequences a sufficient number of genomes to quantify strain count. We aim to define strain
count in healthy and IBD microbiomes which will allow for higher resolution, functional investigations
into microbiome composition in disease. In Aim 2—we will investigate the effect of increasing strain
count on colitis severity. We will combine defined communities of strains isolated from an IBD and healthy
microbiota in a gnotobiotic T cell transfer colitis model. The defined communities will allow us to specifically
increase strain count while holding species diversity stable. By studying the functional role of strain count, we
can uncover the potential contributions of microbiome strain-level architecture to the disease process and
identify appropriate targets for optimizing FMT for the treatment of IBD."

Molecular mechanisms of nucleic acid recognition and maintenance in meiosis and innate immunity
 I am a biochemist and structural biologist with a strong interest in the molecular mechanisms of genome
maintenance. Since starting my own laboratory in 2011, I have made major contributions in the areas of
chromosome organization and recombination in eukaryotic meiosis, in particular defining the molecular
architecture and assembly mechanisms of the meiotic chromosome axis. My laboratory also determined the
structure and mechanism of TRIP13, an ATPase regulator of HORMA domain signaling proteins in mitosis,
meiosis, and DNA repair. As an Associate Professor and Vice Chair of the UC San Diego Biomedical Sciences
graduate program, I contribute significantly to graduate teaching and advising. I am also active in the broader
scientific community, having participated in grant review for NIH, graduate fellowship review for NSF, and
having served on an NIH Center for Scientific Review workgroup in 2019-2020.
 My laboratory's work over the next five years will focus on a diverse but conceptually related set of
questions in genome maintenance and protein-nucleic acid recognition. Our primary interest is in meiosis, the
specialized two-stage cell division program that gives rise to haploid gametes and is crucial for sexual
reproduction in eukaryotes. Building off our work defining the architecture of the chromosome axis, we will
determine how the axis interacts with and controls the activity of DNA-binding cohesin complexes, and how the
axis recruits and controls recombination proteins to drive the formation of inter-homolog crossovers. Next, we
are pursuing collaborative projects to understand the structural basis for sequence- and structure-specific RNA
recognition in two contexts. With Gene Yeo (UCSD), we are developing a new generation of programmable
sequence-specific RNA binding proteins to target and degrade disease-associated mRNAs in diverse diseases
from cancer to neurodegeneration. With Matt Daugherty (UCSD), we are determining how IFIT proteins in the
mammalian innate immune system cooperate to specifically recognize viral RNAs and inhibit their translation.
Finally, my laboratory has begun a new effort aimed at determining the molecular mechanisms of novel
bacterial defense systems in which canonical genome-maintenance machines have adapted to new roles. In
our first work in this area, we have found that the condensin/cohesin-like MksBEFG system protects its
bacterial hosts from plasmid transformation by specifically recognizing and cleaving closed-circular DNA.
 I am fascinated by molecular machines, particularly those that maintain genome integrity in the face of
constant internal and external assault. My research program is aimed at understanding the molecular basis for
genome maintenance in diverse contexts, and in exploring how the proteins responsible for genome
maintenance have adapted to new roles throughout evolution."

engineering and business, while the Worcester campus houses the UMass Chan Medical School, the first and
only public academic health system in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Over the past five years, CAPCaT
has conducted four national calls for applications and from 441 applicants has selected, awarded, monitored,
and comprehensively supported 23 HLBS POC innovations. CAPCaT awardees have raised over $43M in
funding, refined/developed new products, generated 9 new intellectual properties, and brought new technologies
to market. In this competitive renewal, the Technology Core of CAPCaT will continue to issue broad-reaching
calls for applications and will select and support new meritorious projects focusing on later-stage POC and home-
based technologies from across the HLBS space. Selection will be based on performance and potential for
clinical impact, likelihood of implementation and addressing an HLBS health disparity. CAPCaT’s Technology
Core will support selected projects utilizing a strong collection of existing resources at UMass Lowell and UMass
Chan to help further develop and refine later-stage prototypes to the point of validation and user-testing."

Point-of-care (POC) and home-based technologies are increasingly important tools for patients, caregivers, and
healthcare providers to diagnose and treat critical health issues. In acute care settings, clinicians and caregivers
need real-time data to guide management of potentially rapidly changing health conditions; in home settings,
providers seek new ways to better communicate and engage patients in promoting health and managing chronic
conditions. The commercialization and adoption of technologies sold over the counter and intended for home
use has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and increasingly allows for the realization of more
empowered and proactive patient care. As a Technology Research and Development Center (TRDC), the goal
of the Center for Advancing Point of Care Technologies (CAPCaT) is to develop and optimize novel POC
and home-based technologies to improve the diagnosis and treatment of Heart, Lung, Blood and Sleep
(HLBS) disorders. The CAPCaT Clinical Core will contribute to this goal by leveraging core competencies to
facilitate clinical validation and usability studies, especially those that address health inequity and can be used
in underserved communities. As the primary POC Technology Research Network (POCTRN) member
responsible for leading clinicals studies for RADx Tech, CAPCaT partnered with community organizations,
practice-based and academic clinical trial networks, members of the FDA and other regulators, and industry
partners to design and execute inclusive clinical studies involving over 15,000 participants from racially and
geographically diverse backgrounds.(1) The CAPCaT Clinical Core will capitalize on its unique infrastructure and
expert team to continue to provide support for the design and execution of clinical studies to demonstrate the
usability and efficacy of devices that advance disease management. To date, the CAPCaT Clinical Core has
worked successfully with its External Advisory Committee and Data Safety Monitoring Board to monitor, engage,
and support 23 HLBS innovators by providing technical, logistical, and operational support to CAPCaT teams
conducting later-stage clinical validation and usability studies, including demonstration studies that adapt
technologies for use in lower resource environments. Our team, experience and competencies make us uniquely
suited to provide the broad array of services that facilitate clinical research and support the development of
devices to improve the diagnosis and treatment of HLBS disorders and promote health equity. Our objectives in
achieving this goal are to continue: 1) Select clinically relevant POC and home-based technologies and design

A major function of the Center for the Advancement of Point-of-Care Technologies (CAPCaT) in heart, lung,
blood, and sleep (HLBS) disorders is to train innovators developing novel point-of-care and home-based
technologies; and disseminate both those technologies and insights about the product development process to
a wide group of stakeholders. HLBS disorders are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the US, despite
decades of research and substantial improvements in treatments, prevention and outcomes. Health care is
undergoing a transformation in care delivery from medical centers and office-based settings to remote-monitoring
and home-based care. The development of POC will greatly facilitate and accelerate this transformation by: 1)
providing methods to monitor health/medical status in people as they go about their daily lives outside the clinic;
2) delivering actionable reports to the point of care; and 3) providing rapid feedback to caregivers and patients
to improve patient self-care, symptom detection, diagnosis, and treatment delivery. POCT product development
is challenging because of the need to integrate disparate disciplines such as human biology, engineering,
software, and device development. New models are emerging in both academia and industry to implement cross-
functional development teams and to speed the translational process. A key element of success is the
development of novel training programs to expose POC developers and users to the clinical and process issues
related to device development, validation and commercialization. CAPCaT will develop and lead innovative
teaching programs and leverage complementary educational opportunities to provide a comprehensive training
and dissemination plan for the POC development community. Highlights of this program will include a short-
course modeled on the I-Corps program, a dynamic educational series on the clinical and process elements of
POC development, and an annual stakeholder showcase day. The knowledge generated through these
programs will, in turn, be used to inform other core activities of CAPCaT."
10753550,"Adaptive transcriptome evolution likely underlies a substantial component of all adaptations. Here I propose to
study two main types of transcriptome evolution using Drosophila. First, we will identify genetic novelties,
focusing on reproductive tissues, including analysis at the single-cell level. We will then investigate the
functions of these novelties in two species using a variety of genetic and biochemical tools, including CRISPR
and RNAi to learn about the agents of selection acting on these novelties. Second, we will use population
approaches to characterize adaptive transcriptome divergence contributing to local adaptation within species,
and transcriptome adaptation over longer timescales between species. We will then use these results to infer
the fraction of the transcriptome evolving adaptively for multiple tissues and species. We will use genetic and
ATAC-seq experiments to investigate whether convergent expression adaptation generally has a shared
genetic basis or whether adaptation generally proceeds by different trajectories in different species."
10753565,"An estimated 53,260 new oropharyngeal cancer cases and 10,750 deaths will occur in U.S. during 2020. Unfortunately, oral
squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most challenging-to-treat human cancers. Even if surgical resections are
curative, facial structures vital for function and esthetics are sacrificed. OSCC, however, doesn't occur de novo, but arises
from initiated keratinocytes. This pre-transformation interval provides a therapeutic window for secondary OSCC
chemoprevention. Specific situations such as tobacco and/or alcohol use or diseases associated with DNA repair deficits
e.g. Fanconi anemia (FA) can render the entire oral cavity at risk to develop OSCC. Although systemically-delivered
chemopreventives should conceptually provide full mouth field-coverage, bioavailability challenges and drug-related
systemic toxicities have generated disappointing outcomes. In contrast, local delivery formulations can deliver
therapeutically-relevant levels of chemopreventives-at markedly lower doses relative to systemic administration-to target
tissue without drug-related systemic side-effects. Notably, the oral cavity is bathed in a protective, viscoelastic, adhesive
coating hydrogel (mucous). While mucous can impede local drug delivery, mucoadhesive and mucopenetrating nanoparticle
chemopreventive formulations address this issue. Nanoparticles also function to stabilize drugs, minimize off-target side
effects, prolong chemopreventive-oral epithelial contact time and facilitate delivery to the underlying keratinocytes. The
chemopreventives for this study were selected based on our results and their complementary mechanisms of action. IL6,
produced by oral keratinocytes and other cells, is a pervasive cytokine throughout the mouth including saliva. Via its
proinflammatory, pro-proliferative and proangiogenic properties, IL6 can facilitate malignant transformation of oral
intraepithelial neoplasia to OSCC. To suppress this autocrine-paracrine loop, the IL6 receptor inhibitor, tocilizumab (TCZ)
was selected. In addition, our labs have shown that the synthetic vitamin A derivative, fenretinide (4HPR), not only
possesses growth modulatory effects, but it also demonstrates high affinity binding/inactivation of signaling kinases
upregulated during carcinogenesis i.e. FAK, Pyk2, STAT3, Wnt, c-Src and c-Abl and perturbs cytoskeletal components
necessary for OSCC cell invasion. Our data also show that while single agents are beneficial, TCZ+4HPR combination
treatment enhances the agents' chemopreventive efficacy in both in vitro and in vivo models. The Specific Aims of this
proposal are: 1) Optimize Janus nanoparticles (JNPs) for targeted co-delivery of 4HPR & TCZ to surface oral epithelium,
2) Identify the lead JNP formulation by using bioassay-based in vitro studies and an in vivo PK model., 3) Conduct a Phase
0 pharmacokinetic/ADME trial in healthy volunteers. Experimental methodology will include: electrohydrodynamic co-
jetting in conjunction with dynamic light scattering, zeta sizing and electron microscopy to formulate the JNPs, ex vivo
mucoadherence studies, in vitro monolayer and raft culture functional assays, LC-MS, IHC (quantified by image analysis),
and in vivo (rabbit model) and human clinical trial PK analyses."
10750881,"Though preclinical studies indicate that HIV medications harm hearing and magnify the risk of ototoxic hearing
loss, there has been no investigation of the impact of these drugs, and their resulting mitochondrial damage, on
hearing in people taking these medications for the management or prevention of HIV. As such, there is a critical
need for knowledge of the effects of HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in
humans and the relationship between these mitochondrial mutations and auditory status. My long-term career
goal is to become a VA Career Scientist dedicated to preventing or alleviating the impacts of auditory impairment
in Veterans through studies that combine hearing loss epidemiology, mechanisms and modeling. My immediate
goals for this proposed CDA are to gain specific training in statistical modeling, genetics, and human auditory
physiology that will enable me to forecast ototoxic-acquired hearing loss in individual-patients and minimize the
auditory dysfunction resulting from these exposures. An additional goal for this CDA is to generate publications
and pilot data to support a VA Merit Review and/or NIH R01 award. My overall objective for this proposed CDA
research is to identify genetic and clinical markers of patients who are at high risk for antiretroviral-induced
hearing loss and effective alternatives to reduce and prevent that damage. The central hypothesis is that specific
ART drugs cause auditory dysfunction and mtDNA damage. The rationale for the proposed research is that once
ART drugs causing these mutations have been identified, treatment recommendations can be modified to reduce
and prevent ototoxic hearing loss for people taking antiretroviral medications. To test my central hypothesis, the
research team will pursue two specific aims: 1) Classify risk for mutations of mtDNA by ART exposure regimen;
and 2) [Estimate ART-related risk for auditory dysfunction] among patients exposed to ART. For this first aim,
[we will use data available from the Million Veteran Program (MVP) create a] cohort of patients receiving ART:
1) for the management of HIV and 2) for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection. [Using clinical
and genetic information available in the MVP data core,] the research team will identify relationships between
different ART combinations and three mtDNA mutations that have been associated with increased ototoxicity.
For the second aim, a predictive machine learning model will be created for antiretroviral-induced ototoxicity.
This model will be trained and tested on data from a cross-sectional cohort to identify key predictors of auditory
dysfunction. This model-driven approach has the advantage of detecting changes in auditory performance with
greater accuracy and speed than traditional hearing screening approaches and can be used to forecast hearing
loss due to a hypothetical exposure before the exposure occurs. Additionally, access to this large national cohort
will provide critical information for a needs assessment of current practices at the interface of HIV and audiologic
care, including most common ART prescriptive patterns and the uptake of audiological services across drug
regimens. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to identify ART regimens used in the
management and prevention of HIV that are less ototoxic and genotoxic overall. Especially given the importance
of the use of ART in stopping the spread of HIV, this research is essential in identifying and proactively reducing
hearing loss, a side effect of treatment that reduces social and emotional well-being and can lead to non-
compliance and the subsequent continued spread of HIV. These studies will provide the basis for a multi-site
study investigating these and other mtDNA mutations in a large prospective cohort which will allow for more
robust development and testing of this predictive model and genetic determinants of hearing loss."
10892265,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Death or chronic lung dysfunction from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a dreaded consequence
of acute injury to the alveolar gas exchange region of lung. Other than antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia and
in some cases anti-inflammatory medications like corticosteroids, there are no specific therapies beyond
supplementary oxygen and ventilatory support. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand how acute
alveolar injury is repaired and in cases when this is insufficient, what are the reasons for the failure to recover
gas exchange function. Once the precise cellular and molecular regenerative and maladaptive alveolar
responses are identified, we can move on to rationally engineer novel and specific treatments to promote
repair. We have recently mapped at high resolution the alveolar regenerative response to alveolar epithelial
type I (AT1) cell ablation, which revealed several unexpected mechanisms. In addition to conventional AT2
stem cell proliferation, we identified two other regenerative mechanisms. The first was immediate
transdifferentiation of AT2 cells without prior proliferation, followed by mitosis of resident binucleated AT2
progenitors found in healthy lungs. We also identified pathological responses from repeated AT1 cell ablation
consisting of excessive AT2 stem cell proliferation with loss of surfactant function and impaired AT1 cell
differentiation. Here, we plan to flesh out the molecular and cellular regulation of these regenerative programs
and to determine their physiological impact on maintaining proper gas exchange by preventing capillary leak
and pulmonary edema. In summary, we will apply precise cell type ablation and injury with state-of-the-art
experimental approaches to clarify at high temporal resolution the cellular and molecular basis of alveolar
epithelial repair."
10748293,"Project Summary/Abstract
Faithfully segregating chromosomes during mitosis relies on a properly assembled spindle apparatus with
centrosomes anchoring mitotic microtubules on both sides of it. The centrosome is a major microtubule-
organizing center (MTOC) in animal cells. It consists of a pair of centrioles surrounded by the pericentriolar
material (PCM). The PCM nucleates and anchors microtubules and thus dictates the MTOC activity of the
centrosome. Centrosomes rapidly expand their PCM at the onset of mitosis. This process, termed centrosome
maturation, is critical for spindle organization and chromosome segregation. However, there is a fundamental
gap in understanding how the PCM is assembled and regulated at the onset of mitosis. In addition, while the
framework of centrosome maturation has been elucidated at the molecular level, the fundamental principle of
PCM assembly remains elusive at the organellar level—without an enclosing membrane, what keeps the
crowded PCM proteins from dispersing? What glue holds this membraneless ensemble together as a micron-
sized centrosome during mitosis? In vertebrates, centrosome maturation is driven in part by pericentrin
(PCNT), a large PCM protein linked to human developmental disorders, including primordial dwarﬁsm,
microcephaly, and Down syndrome. PCNT acts as a scaffold in the recruitment of other PCM proteins during
centrosome maturation. Our recent work reveals that PCNT is delivered co-translationally to mitotic
centrosomes and this co-translational targeting of PCNT facilitates centrosome maturation. Our long-term goal
is to understand how the centrosome is assembled and functions. The overall objective is to elucidate the role
of PCNT in regulating centrosome maturation and PCM assembly. Based on our recent work and preliminary
studies, we hypothesize that co-translational protein targeting promotes PCNT phase separation via proximity-
driven condensation, a process that facilitates proper PCM assembly, and that PLK1 regulates the co-
translational targeting process in addition to its role at the mitotic centrosome. We will test our hypothesis in
three speciﬁc aims: (1) determine the contribution of PCNT condensation in centrosome maturation, (2)
determine the relationship between co-translational targeting and phase separation of PCNT, and (3)
determine the molecular mechanisms through which dynein and PLK1 regulate co-translational targeting of
PCNT. The molecular mechanisms underlying centrosome assembly in vertebrate cells remain to be
elucidated. Understanding these processes is the key to fully understanding how centrosome function is
normally regulated and disrupted in human disease."
10748295,"Abstract/Project Summary: High-risk medication use is essential for certain disease states, such as diabetes
mellitus, and transitions of care can be an especially hazardous time for those new to diabetes medications.
Novel delivery methods, especially for telehealth, are needed in for the peri- and post-COVID era. The sickest
population of patients, those with diabetes in the hospital, often require in depth knowledge and education
transfer, as they transition from the inpatient to outpatient setting, but currently are getting in person and/or
telemedicine training. The goal of this research project is to adapt a diabetes discharge toolkit [integrated
software (website/app/print) and hardware (3-D printed kit) system] for use in a telehealth setting, utilizing
novel learning science methods. We then propose to integrate and implement an intervention testing the newly
adapted Telehealth Diabetes Discharge Toolkit for those requiring new and/or additional DM medications, and
additional diabetes education at discharge. The goal will be to evaluate the implementation of the DM Toolkit at
discharge, and then assess the feasibility of a pilot clinical trial of the intervention on glycemic control and
glycemic excursions as well as other self-care and psychosocial measures."

This proposal represents a five-year research career development program focusing on identifying early
predictors of chronic motor control impairments post-stroke. The outlined proposal builds on the candidate’s
prior research and experience, and will contribute to the candidate’s development as an independent
researcher by supporting her training in the application of neuroimaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and
advanced biostatistical analysis in post-stroke recovery research.
Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the US. Of those who receive rehabilitation therapy,
approximately 40% have chronically impaired motor function of the upper extremity, contributing to decreased
quality of life and increased societal burden of stroke. Currently, clinical rehabilitation focus on repetitive motor
exercises, but interventions are not adapted for individual stroke lesion location or predicted trajectory of
recovery. Prior studies have identified distinct impairments of motor control that contribute to poor function at
the chronic stage and likely depend on neuroanatomical structures damaged by the stroke, but the details of
what contributes to development of these impairments and timing of when they emerge remains unclear. In
order to create optimal rehabilitation strategies and maximize each individual patient’s rehabilitation potential,
we need better methods for predicting and treating these motor control impairments.
In this proposal, we aim to use an electromyographic computer interface (ECI) to study motor impairments in
the muscle groups that control wrist flexion and extension, and perform a longitudinal study to 1) establish the
natural history of distinct motor control impairments post-stroke and 2) identify early neuroimaging,
electrophysiologic, and clinical markers that predict specific motor impairments at the chronic stage. We then
3) evaluate the feasibility of using the ECI to provide early, intensive biofeedback therapy to target the
predicted impairments of the individual patients. These studies will establish the necessary foundation for
future development of precision-medicine therapies in neurorehabilitation. Furthermore, the mentored research
and career development plan will provide the applicant with the opportunity for further training in leading
longitudinal studies, advanced biostatistical analysis, and functional and structural neuroimaging. The results of
this research and career development award will foster the expansion of her clinical research program, which
is dedicated to developing novel therapies to treat early motor changes post-stroke."

Tools to determine and analyze the structures of molecular machines in motion
Single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has transformed our ability to rapidly determine high
resolution structures of static, structurally homogeneous macromolecular complexes. However, we have not
realized cryo-EM’s potential to uncover the full ensemble of heterogeneous structures these molecules adopt as
they function. The overall objective of this work is to develop novel cryo-EM image processing tools to: 1)
determine the complete ensemble of structural states adopted by imaged complexes; 2) quantify the relative
abundance of these states; 3) monitor how the distribution of these states changes as the machine functions;
and 4) use this information to understand the molecular mechanism of how these machines assemble and
function. This objective is important as visualizing structural ensembles can be vital in developing and testing
hypotheses for how these machines function, and in developing therapeutics to modulate their activity. Here, we
specifically aim to develop two tools to facilitate achieving these overall objectives. First, we will generate
‘benchmark’ datasets that will be distributed to the methods development community to aid in building and
quantitatively assessing of the fidelity of different approaches to reconstruct 3D density maps from single particle
cryo-EM data. These benchmark datasets will include macromolecular complexes bearing elements of structural
heterogeneity we have specifically designed for this purpose, and that we have biochemically assembled and
imaged. Additionally, it will design, implement, and validate a machine learning-based computational tool that
more realistically simulates the imaging process than existent software, thereby enabling users to rapidly
construct custom synthetic benchmark datasets to test specific aspects of their own algorithms. Recently, as a
proof-of-concept, we published the first method using deep neural networks to perform 3D reconstruction from
single particle data, and this approach was particularly efficacious is revealing heterogeneous structures. Thus,
our second aim is to develop this approach into a complete software package enabling users to readily
reconstruct hundreds-to-thousands of density maps from a single dataset; to implement tools to focus the
analysis on specific structural regions; and to deploy methods guiding the interpretation of the density maps and
the construction of ensembles of associated atomic models. This work in innovative in its objective to analyze
heterogeneous structural ensembles as opposed to static structures at high resolution; in our approach to model
model conformational changes as originating from a continuous distribution of structures as opposed to isolated,
discrete states; and in our application of deep learning methods to both the generation of benchmark datasets
and in the reconstruction process itself. As a proof-of-concept, our reconstruction approach has proven
significant as evidenced by its recent application in multiple structural studies, and we expect the tools we
propose to develop here will be broadly impactful on a wide-array of NIH-funded research programs that rely on
single particle cryo-EM."
10749060,"Enhanced Imaging of the Fetal Brain Microstructure
The fetal period of brain development is critical as it involves complex processes of cell proliferation,
neuronal migration, and myelination that are particularly vulnerable to disturbances from adverse events
in utero and conditions that develop during gestation. Specifically, hypoxia caused by abnormal circulation,
is hypothesized to disrupt neuronal migration thereby causing altered brain connectivity and adverse
neurological outcomes. Abnormal brain connectivity has been depicted in newborns and adolescents with
critical congenital heart disease (CHD) using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Gross brain abnormalities
have also been identified and quantified prenatally in CHD using in utero T2-weighted magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), but the precise location and timing of disrupted neuronal migration that leads to these
abnormalities, has remained unclear due to technological limitations of in utero DWI. In this project we aim
at developing new DWI technologies that remove these barriers to improve our understanding of the
maturation of fetal brain microstructure as well as the origins and patterns of its alterations in utero. In
particular, we aim to develop new techniques to address the limitations of current fetal DWI technology by
effectively mitigating and compensating for motion and geometric distortion artifacts during acquisitions.
This project therefore seeks to create a paradigm shift in the way fetal DWI is acquired and analyzed. The
three specific aims of the project are to 1) create a prospectively motion-corrected slice navigation system
for fetal brain DWI, 2) enhance fetal DWI acquisitions with artifact reduction and compensation by
developing new imaging and image reconstruction techniques for dynamic field mapping, and 3) evaluate
fetal brain maturation in congenital heart disease. We will assess the utility and impact of the technologies
developed in this project by analyzing and comparing a large pre-existing cohort of fetal DWI scans with
the scans prospectively acquired from both typically-developing (TD) and CHD fetuses with these new
techniques. Moreover, we expect to gain important knowledge about early disruptions to neuronal
migration pathways and formation of brain connections due to compromised circulation and hypoxia in
fetuses with CHD. By making fetal DWI more reliable and robust, this study will mitigate a critical barrier to
making progress in the fields of developmental neurology and neuroscience. Improved understanding of
the impact of adverse events in utero on fetal brain growth and the trajectories of altered brain development
can help guide neuroprotective and therapeutic interventions, and enable early, more effective treatments
for neurological diseases and mental disorders. Fetal DWI plays a crucial role in establishing such an
understanding as it is uniquely able to depict the microstructure of the fetal brain in utero."
10906670,"Humans generally heal skin injuries with a fibrous scar, which results in increased skin tightness,
altered cosmesis, and morbidity when scars form over joints. Under specific and rare circumstances, humans
and mammals exhibit spontaneous tissue regeneration, which heals tissue to their original architecture and
function without a scar. Thus, the molecular machinery for tissue regeneration exists in mammals and
understanding how to elicit regeneration will help us attain our long-term goal of regenerating injured human
skin. Prior work from our group and others used ear hole closure to demonstrate that “regeneration-competent”
mouse strains, including p21–/–, wildtype aged, and skin-specific CXCL12–/– mice, close ear holes to ~90% of
the wounded size compared to control mice, which close holes to ~50%. Despite this improved healing, only
1% of regeneration-competent mice achieved complete ear hole closure. During the past funding cycle, we
increased the frequency of complete hole closure, and most recently showed that topical imiquimod activates
TRPA1+ neurons to drive complete ear hole closure in 20% of mice. This 20-fold improvement is substantial,
and we continue to aim higher. In our preliminary data, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing on wound-
edge tissue from TRPA1+ activated and aged mice to identify signaling pathways driving tissue regeneration.
Ligand-receptor interaction analysis identified a new receptor-mediated signaling pathway that promotes tissue
regeneration. Unexpectedly, mice lacking this receptor exhibited the opposite phenotype; they demonstrated
faster wound closure, decreased scar formation, and improved tissue regeneration in 3 different skin injury
models. However, topical imiquimod treatment synergizes with receptor deficient mice to increase the
frequency of complete ear hole closure to 90%. Taken together, we conclude that this newly identified receptor
regulates both speed and quality of wound repair, which counters the current paradigm that the speed of
wound closure and quality of wound healing are inversely related. Moreover, this pathway is independent from
TRPA1+ neurons to promote regeneration. We hypothesize that this receptor pathway promotes scar
formation and blocking this receptor permits tissue regeneration. In Aim 1, we elucidate the molecular
mechanism of how this receptor promotes scar formation. We will use mouse genetics and our injury models to
identify which cell types expressing this receptor are necessary and sufficient to drive scar formation. Next, we
will use mouse genetics and pharmacologic inhibitors to identify the molecular mechanisms downstream of the
receptor that promote scar formation. In Aim 2, a major gap in the wound healing field is the limited
understanding of human wound healing due to sample availability. To fill this gap, we created the infrastructure
to collect human skin in a dense time course after injury for single-cell RNA-sequencing. We expect increased
recruitment of cells expressing our receptor to the injury site, and we will compare transcriptomic changes
against our mouse dataset. Importantly, this dataset will be a resource for all wound healing researchers.
Finally, we will translate our 90% complete ear hole closure finding into human skin. We hypothesize that
combination small molecule mediated inhibition of our receptor and topical imiquimod will reduce scar
formation in human skin. We will test this possibility by using human orthotopic skin xenografts on immune-
deficient mice. If successful, this data may serve as the pre-clinical foundation for a future clinical trial. Taken
together, we continue to improve our understanding of eliciting scarless wound healing and actively translate
our findings into humans, which is applicable to all Veterans living with traumatic or surgically-created wounds."

Quitting smoking at any age can have significant health benefits which extend beyond its well-recognized
impact on cancer. The Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) World Trade Center Health Program
(WTCHP) is situated within its occupational health clinics. All participants in the FDNY WTCHP low dose
computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening program have access to a free, tobacco cessation
program (typically cessation counseling plus nicotine replacement treatment). While many are now former
smokers, 36% of LDCT program participants continue to smoke. Novel strategies are needed to engage
WTCHP members who continue to smoke into evidence-based smoking cessation treatment. In the proposed
trial, participants in the FDNY WTCHP LDCT screening program who are retired from FDNY will be
randomized to receive Standard Care: a letter with information about LDCT screening and the free FDNY
Tobacco Cessation program including varenicline treatment and cessation counselling via telemedicine or
Enhanced Care: a letter informing them that they will be enrolled in the FDNY Tobacco Cessation Program
unless they opt-out, similar access to varenicline treatment, but coupled with individually-tailored telemedicine
sessions with our tobacco treatment specialist using that person’s most recent LDCT results to personalize
cessation messaging. All participants will receive varenicline “preloading,” i.e., four weeks of treatment prior to
their target quit date followed by 12 weeks of treatment, an approach shown to decrease pre-quit tobacco-
associated reward. Each of the essential elements of this Enhanced Care method: opt-out enrollment and
individually-tailored biofeedback linked to LDCT results has been shown to be effective in other settings.1-5 This
protocol is the first to combine these elements plus varenicline treatment with preloading in a randomized trial
of high-risk smokers (defined as those meeting LDCT screening criteria plus WTC exposure) who have either
not enrolled in tobacco cessation or not succeeded in previous quit attempts under Standard Care. We
hypothesize that the FDNY Enhanced Care Program will be associated with both increased enrollment and
improved rates of tobacco treatment outcomes compared with Standard Care.
Specific Aim 1: To compare enrollment (participation in a first visit with our tobacco treatment specialist) in the
FDNY Tobacco Cessation Program by Standard Care vs. Enhanced Care methods.
 Specific aim 1a: To evaluate demographic and clinical characteristics associated with FDNY Tobacco
 Cessation Program enrollment.
Specific Aim 2: To compare outcomes (retention to study end-date, varenicline and counseling adherence and
tobacco quit rates) in the FDNY Tobacco Cessation Program by Standard Care vs. Enhanced Care methods.
 Specific Aim 2a: To evaluate demographic and clinical characteristics associated with tobacco

The human breast is a highly organized, complex organ that consists of an epithelial tissue surrounded by
stroma that regulates its proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Stroma is responsible for sustaining normal
breast tissue structure and function via a variety of signaling mechanisms that control and regulate normal
processes and suppress malignant transformation. The role of stroma in breast tumor initiation, progression,
and responsiveness to treatment as well as potential utility for targeted therapies has been widely discussed in
recent reviews. While cancer tissue stroma has been widely explored, the evidence of stromal contributions to
early stages of carcinogenesis is extremely limited. To fill these gaps, we propose a conceptually and
methodologically novel investigation that will focus on benign breast disease (BBD) and high mammographic
breast density (MBD), strong risk factors both independently associated with increased breast cancer (BCa)
risk, which presents a unique opportunity for studying early changes in the breast and elucidating underlying
molecular mechanisms. The study will be conducted by an interdisciplinary team of experts in BCa
epidemiology, breast pathology/image analysis, BCa biology, and biostatistics, with a history of long and
productive collaboration. We will use data and breast biopsy samples from three established prospective
cohorts (Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Women’s Health Repository) to address the
following aims: (1) prospectively examine associations of reproductive risk factors (e.g., parity, age at first birth)
with expression of stromal markers (αSMA, FAP, MMP14, TNC, and S100A6) in benign biopsy samples from
cancer-free women (n~1,350); (2) examine associations of stromal markers with MBD (n~1,350); and (3)
examine associations of stromal markers in women with a previous benign biopsy and the risk of subsequent
BCa in a nested case-control design (~400 cases/~975 controls). This proposal leverages established tissue
resources, use of validated multiplex immunoflourence for stromal markers, and automated image analysis for
MBD assessment. Understanding the associations of BCa risk factors with stromal markers will advance our
knowledge on its role in breast carcinogenesis in epidemiologic studies. We will generate the first
comprehensive data on the stromal markers’ expression in non-cancer breast and will identify markers that
could significantly advance future risk prediction. Stromal activity is potentially modifiable via a variety of
targeted therapies; if our project successfully demonstrates an association between stromal markers in benign
breast tissue and increased BCa risk and/or high MBD, these findings could eventually translate into
pharmaceutical interventions aimed at primary BCa prevention in high-risk women with high MBD and/or BBD.
Importantly, these findings would apply to a large segment of women undergoing routine biopsies and those
with high MBD in whom novel prevention strategies, improved risk prediction, and tailored clinical management
are urgently needed."

We recently found that World Trade Center (WTC)-exposed rescue/recovery workers who participated in the
WTC Health Program (WTCHP) experienced improved survival post-cancer diagnosis compared with
demographically similar cancer patients from New York State. This survival benefit was observed in both all-
cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality. Further, we documented this benefit both in cancers with
elevated incidence and cancers with reduced incidence compared with the general population. As part of the
WTCHP, enrollees receive medical monitoring and cancer care, including treatment, at no cost to them. We
hypothesized that the observed survival benefit was due to the level of care that these rescue/recovery
workers receive as part of the WTCHP. We could not rule out however, the possibility that rescue/recovery
workers were healthier than the reference population of New York State cancer patients prior to cancer
diagnosis and therefore more likely to have a favorable cancer outcome (i.e., due to the healthy worker effect).
However, no survival benefit was observed for WTC-exposed rescue/recovery not enrolled in the WTCHP – a
fact that argues against the healthy worker effect as the sole factor. Now, we propose to address this
knowledge gap by identifying and quantifying the sources of the observed survival benefit using an
occupationally appropriate cohort as a comparison. The overall goal of the current proposal is to investigate
cancer survival and survival-related factors such as cancer-specific pathology and treatment initiation in
WTCHP responders (firefighters and police) and non-WTC-exposed responders (i.e., firefighters and police
who met similar health criteria for hiring as WTC-exposed responders), compared with each other, by
occupation, and with the general US population. Results from this proposal have the potential to elucidate the
impact of WTCHP medical monitoring and treatment on survival post-cancer diagnoses and to help inform
health care delivery systems. Further, while the project is focused on WTC responders, its results could have
broader implications for workers occupationally exposed to environmental contaminants."

Pharmacotherapy during pregnancy is inevitable and current interventional strategies are not successful in
reducing the risks of pregnancy related disorders. A better understanding of the drug transport mechanisms
involved at feto-maternal interface (FMi) is required to improve the pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. The
expression levels of the drug transporter proteins decrease as the gestation period progresses. Our data
suggested that sodium hydrogen exchange regulatory factor-1 (NHERF-1) interacts with efflux transporter
protein, permeability glycoprotein (P-gp), and this interaction is predominantly more in the fetal membrane
rather than the placenta. Consistent with this data, efflux drug mechanism is also higher in the chorion cells of
fetal membrane than placenta trophoblast cells. On the other hand, extracellular vesicles derived from fetal
membrane are involved in the paracrine signaling that induce inflammatory changes in maternal decidua and
myometrium. Along with that, EVs carry drug transporter proteins as their cargo proteins and are involved in
modifying maternal cells for transporter protein functional activities. This proposal builds on these observations;
the central hypothesis is the NHERF-1 in the fetal membrane could be targeted to regulate the drug
transportation during pregnancy. We will determine the mechanistic network of P-gp/NHERF-1 across fetal
maternal interface using innovative FM-PLA - organ on chip (OOC) devices (Aim-1). In Aim 1, we will use the
OOC that mimic an in-utero environment to test the kinetics of P-gp substrate, Tacrolimus across the FMi in
normal healthy and disease conditions along with in presence and absence of NHERF-1. The expression of
the P-gp and NHERF-1 will be determined across the FMi. EVs derived from the fetal membrane carry drug
transporter proteins but their role in the regulation of drug transportation remains unknown. In Aim-2 we will
explore the uptake mechanism of the EVs by maternal cells and determine their role in regulating drug
transportation using P-gp knock down mice. Given the critical role of NHERF-1 and EVs from the fetal

completion of the study will provide novel insights into how the fetal membrane TPs and EVs derived at FMi

 Studies in neurophysiology have historically excluded female participants. This has resulted in a well
encompassing understanding of the neural control of movement in males, and a poor understanding of
mechanisms underlying motor control differences in females. There is great need to study female motor
physiology, as many neurological diseases progress differently between the sexes. In recent years, studies that
have included adequate numbers of female participants have found motoneuronal discharge patterns and
neuromuscular fatigue differ between the sexes but the mechanisms underlying these differences are unknown.
Descending monoaminergic input from brainstem nuclei provide and modify motoneuronal discharge and is
broadly understudied in the motor system. Our lab, however, has developed robust methods to quantify these
monoaminergic influences on motoneuron discharge in humans. Thus, to understand if monoaminergic input is
responsible for sex differences in motoneuron properties, I will indirectly quantify the amount of monoaminergic
input to motoneurons in females and males.
 Motor commands consist of excitation, inhibition, and a lesser known neuromodulatory component that result
in their subsequent discharge and activation of innervated muscle fibers. Neuromodulation is induced by release
of two monoamines, serotonin and norepinephrine, from the brainstem to the spinal cord, which substantially
alter discharge patterns of motoneurons. Sex hormones have extensive effects on many physiological systems
in the human body and differ between the sexes. Females have levels of estradiol and progesterone that fluctuate
regularly across the menstrual cycle and these fluctuations are associated with aspects motor control, including
motoneuron discharge rates and fatigue. Additionally, neurons throughout the body, including the brainstem and
spinal cord, contain estradiol and progesterone receptors. This suggests that fluctuating sex hormones may
impact motoneuron function, but, again, underlying mechanisms have not been studied. Thus, to accurately
assess sex differences in motoneuron discharge, hormonal cycles must be considered. I will use surface EMG
arrays to quantify motoneuron discharge patterns during voluntary isometric contractions to determine 1) if
monoaminergic input to motoneurons differs between males and females, and 2) whether motoneuron discharge
patterns fluctuate across the menstrual cycle in females.
 This study will assess whether the amount of monoaminergic input motoneurons receive differs between the
sexes to test a possible explanation for known sex differences, while also assessing other aspects of motoneuron
discharge. Whether or not these studies identify sex-differences, findings from this work will not only further the
scientific knowledge of how these sex hormones influence nervous system function but will highlight the critical
importance for additional studies focusing on female participants out of need, necessity, and equity."
10897769,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Survivors of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have reported a wide range of symptoms following recovery from
infection. These long-term sequelae are severe enough to interfere with their daily lives and are now collectively
referred to as post-Ebola syndrome (PES). Although post-viral symptoms have posed a serious problem in the
Ebola outbreaks of 1995 and 2013-2016, little is known about the underlying mechanism of PES pathogenesis.
Ebola virus (EBOV) RNA has been found in immune-privileged sites, such as the eye and semen, so it is
suggested that the virus may persist in tissues to cause continued antigenic stimulation over time. However, not
all cases of PES can be attributed to viral persistence. Most of the symptoms that survivors experience are
autoimmune-like, the most common being arthralgias and myalgias. Autoantibodies against common human
proteins have also been found in survivor serum, alluding to virus-induced autoimmunity. We hypothesize that
both virus-specific and autoimmune antibody responses play a role in the development of PES. Through a
collaboration with Dr. John Schieffelin at Tulane University, we propose to analyze an existing cohort of EVD
survivors and their household contacts from Sierra Leone that have been clinically characterized for development
of PES. Our preliminary findings revealed that antibodies against the immunodominant antigen, the Ebola
glycoprotein (EBOV GP), in asymptomatic EVD survivors were qualitatively different from survivors experiencing
musculoskeletal manifestations of PES. Specifically, antibodies from asymptomatic individuals induced higher
levels of antibody-dependent complement deposition and monocyte-mediated phagocytosis, but not neutrophil-
mediated phagocytosis, and differed in NK cell activation profiles compared with individuals with PES. In addition,
our data has also revealed that IgG1 levels against dsDNA, HSP-60, citrullinated histone, and IFNα are elevated
in EVD survivors and GP-seropositive household contacts (HHC) compared to GP-seronegative HHC, indicating
a correlation between autoantibodies and EBOV infection. Thus, the purpose of this proposal is to further
investigate the role of both virus-specific and autoimmune antibody-mediated innate immune cell activation in
PES, and whether this role is protective or pathologic. To do so, we propose to analyze antibodies for induction
of innate effector function against EBOV-specific proteins in Aim 1 and Aim 2 will focus on the identification of
potential autoimmune antibody responses that are elevated in individuals with PES. Together, these aims will
address the role of qualitatively different antibodies with varying specificities in shaping susceptibility
to/protection from the development of PES and may help to identify potential therapeutic targets to provide proper
and effective treatment to EVD survivors suffering from PES. In addition to providing expertise in immunology,
virology, and Ebola virus disease, my sponsor and co-sponsors, Drs. Bronwyn Gunn, John Schieffelin, and
Anthony Nicola have developed a comprehensive training plan aimed at providing me with the necessary skills
needed for me to succeed in this proposal and as a research scientist."
10754543,"Project Summary – Resource Core
 This grant proposes to continue efforts by the Nonhuman Primate Reagent Resource to develop and
distribute immune cell-depleting antibodies for use in nonhuman primate models of disease. Operational aspects
of the Nonhuman Primate Reagent Resource include seven distinct components whose overall goal is to provide
high-quality, safe, effective and affordable antibody reagents for administration to nonhuman primate.
 We will generate new monoclonal antibodies against NHP targets in conventional or transgenic mice, or from
existing cross-reactive antibodies. Cell-depleting or control antibodies will be engineered into “primatized” forms
to minimize immunogenicity in vivo, and modified to fine tune effector function or glycosylation. Existing platforms
will be used for large-scale antibody expression by transient or stable CHO cell transfection, purification and
buffer formulation. Strict release criteria will be employed for antibody products intended for use in animals. A
web-based platform will be used to disseminate information on reagents available and a marketing plan
established to assure reaching all investigators using nonhuman primate models. Meeting the needs of the
research community will be ensured through community outreach and by establishing a program advisory board.
Program effectiveness will be measured by user surveys. A web-based reagent ordering system and a well-
established fulfillment process will be utilized for timely response to reagent requests.
 These resource activities will be integrated with antibody reagent activities supported by other funding
sources."
10913608,"Abstract
In the Hospital of the Future hospitalization will be reserved almost exclusively for patients with severe acute
illness, staff numbers will be reduced, and hospitals will be built around smart environments that facilitate
consistent delivery of effective, equitable, and error-free care focused on patient-centered rather than provider-
centered outcomes. This is particularly relevant to the surgical population. While ambulatory surgical centers
are the fastest growing providers, more than 51 million inpatients procedures are performed annually in
hospitals in the US and inpatient surgery centers are taking care of sicker and older patients. While
intraoperative mortality is rare due to improvements in surgical techniques, anesthesia management, and
intraoperative monitoring, global postoperative mortality remains the third leading cause of death among
American People. Recent studies have shown that while the incidence of postoperative major complications
after major surgery is similar between hospitals (~25%), the postoperative mortality following postoperative
major complications from one hospital to the other can be up to 2.5-fold higher. This suggests that reducing
variations in mortality following major surgery will require strategies to improve the ability of high-mortality
hospitals to manage postoperative major complications and decrease failure-to-rescue. One of the solutions
identified is to leverage Health Information Technologies. The goal of this proposal is to use machine learning
approaches to develop, validate, and test real-time postoperative risk prediction tools based on multi-modal
data sources using electronic health record data, high-fidelity physiological waveform features, and genomic
data to identify patients who are at risk of developing postoperative major complications after surgery. Using
extensive electronic health record derived annotation augmented with high-fidelity physiological waveform
features and genomic data and applying state-of-the-art machine learning approaches, common patterns in
subjects destined to develop postoperative major complications and those at very low risk of developing
postoperative major complications after surgery will be characterized and quantified. These inputs will then be
used in simulated real-time bedside management to iteratively design a prototype clinical decision support tool.
This clinical decision support tool will be used at discharge from the post anesthesia care unit to identify
surgical patients who will benefit from continuous remote monitoring and early warning system on the ward to
prevent postoperative failure to rescue. The feasibility and acceptability of this approach will then be assessed
in a small-scale prospective, longitudinal pilot evaluation in sequential 10-weeks, 13-weeks, 10-weeks phases
at UCLA to help design a future, large-scale clinical trial."
10894099,"Project Summary
Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States. Patients with stroke are at increased risk of
severe pneumonia and post-stroke pneumonia is associated with poor outcomes. This multi-PI project will
leverage the complementary expertise of a Stroke Neurologist/Immunologist and a Pulmonary Critical Care
physician/Immunologist to jointly tackle the mechanisms of increased risk of severe pneumonia in stroke
patients and the mechanisms of dysregulated neuroinflammation and neurological recovery after stroke.
Preliminary work in our experimental model of ischemic stroke and Klebsiella pneumonia demonstrates that
bacterial inoculation into the lungs leads to reduced neutrophil recruitment and increased bacterial
dissemination after stroke. Furthermore, pneumonia leads to enhanced neuroinflammation and increased
interferon responses in the microglia and endothelial cells after stroke. The primary hypothesis is that stroke
leads to an impairment in neutrophil function allowing for bacterial escape and dissemination through the body,
which in turn leads to a delay in the resolution of neuroinflammation in the brain and further brain injury. The
overall goal of the proposal is to identify new treatment targets to reduce post-stroke pneumonia and improve
outcomes after stroke."
10891646,"Project Summary
Neutrophils are rapidly recruited to the sites of infection and injury to form the first line of defense against invading
pathogens or tissue injury, and play a prominent role in the initiation and progression of the inflammatory
response. However, once the pathogens are cleared, it is critical for neutrophils to be removed to avoid prolonged
inflammation and to avoid inflicting damage to the surrounding tissue. Apoptosis is essential for neutrophil
functional shutdown, removal of emigrated neutrophils, and the timely resolution of inflammation. Platelets are
anucleate blood cells that circulate throughout the body and play an important role in hemostasis, wound healing,
angiogenesis, inflammation, and clot formation. Platelets are naturally filled with secretory granules that store
large amounts of bioactive proteins that are released following platelet activation to participate in a myriad of
physiological processes, including modulating inflammatory responses. The goal of this proposal is to develop a
modular platform technology using synthetic biology to reprogram pluripotent stem cells for the production of
engineered platelets for therapeutic treatments. Towards this end, we propose to capitalize on the innate storage,
trafficking, and release capabilities of platelets to build delivery vehicles that can modulate and actively terminate
neutrophil function."

We propose to continue to follow the racially and socioeconomically diverse Henry Ford Health (HFH)
Childhood Allergy and the Neonatal Environment (CANOE) cohort. The investigative team has specific interest
in the prevention of atopic diseases – including atopic dermatitis (AD), food allergy, asthma and allergic rhinitis
– which pose a significant social, financial, and developmental burden for children and are a priority for the
ECHO program. The incidence rates and fundamental descriptive epidemiology trends of atopic multimorbidity
for children in the US are unknown, although the co-existence of multiple atopic disorders contributes to a
significant detriment in health and development, including neurocognitive deficits and poor growth. Clinical
practice also lacks an early biomarker to identify the children with atopic multimorbidity phenotypes, including
those with AD, food allergy, and asthma with or without allergic rhinitis (referred to herein as severe atopic
multimorbidity [SAMM]). Environmental factors may impact risk of atopy, and DNA methylation (DNAm) is
influenced by environmental factors and can promote immune pathways towards an allergic phenotype through
gene regulation. Limited investigations have been done on placental DNAm, a biologically relevant tissue for
assessing prenatal exposures that may influence risk of atopy and act as an early biomarker of SAMM risk. We
hypothesize that the incidence rates of SAMM vary based on demographic factors. We also hypothesize that
infants at risk of SAMM have differential placental DNAm that may be influenced by environmental factors. The
Specific Aims for this proposal are to: (1) Determine ECHO-wide incidence rates and prevalence over time of
severe atopic multimorbidity (SAMM) evident by the age of 6 years by demographic factors including age, sex,
race/ethnicity, and geography; (2) Determine whether placental DNAm alterations differentiate children with
SAMM and if they are influenced by prenatal environmental exposures; and (3) Utilize community health
workers and diversity, equity, and inclusion principles to connect and engage with study participants to
enhance and complete ECHO study activities and protocols for an additional 7 years; and utilize participant
advisors to amplify the voices of participants and overcome challenges with engagement and retention. The
data generated by this proposal, combined with ECHO-wide data, will allow for accurate estimates of incidence
rates of co-morbid atopic disease phenotypes and is an important step toward understanding how the placenta
may influence allergic disease risk. Most importantly, the data and biospecimens that will be generated by this
cohort as it ages from birth through middle childhood will be a fundamental asset for the ECHO research
platform as numerous investigators all over the country utilize these data to address child health and disease
for years to come. Continued follow-up of the HFH CANOE cohort will allow for solution-oriented investigations
into causes and contributors to health and disease."

10880611,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The past twenty years have seen a sea change in the treatment of many types of cancer, with immunotherapy-
based approaches, including checkpoint blockade and adoptive cell therapy, yielding remarkable results in some
patients. The inability, thus far, to achieve more complete responses in more patients has set off a widespread
effort to identify novel targets for improving rates and duration of response, either as single agents or together
with first-generation immunotherapies, like PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. One of the second-generation checkpoint
targets that has attracted attention from many groups, including our own, is the protein Tim-3. Thus far, mAb’s
targeting Tim-3 have under-performed in clinical trials for solid tumors, likely due in part to the fact that while
Tim-3 is expressed at high levels on exhausted T cells, it is not expressed on the TpEx cells. Obtaining a better
understanding of Tim-3 function in these various cell types may lead to more selective and efficacious Tim3-
targeting therapies, either as single agents or, critically, in combination with PD-1 pathway blockade.
 Work from our groups and others have revealed that Tim-3 appears to be particularly important for the
suppressive function of regulatory T cells (Treg) that are present in high numbers in tumors, in particular “effector”
Treg (eTreg), which are a particularly suppressive subset of Treg. These cells are enriched within solid tumors,
relative to their proportions in normal peripheral tissues, suggesting that they could be attractive targets for more
specific augmentation of immune responses within tumors. Since a significant proportion of Treg express Tim-
3, and the function of this molecule in vivo is still being elucidated, we generated a knockout model to study Tim-
3 on these cells. Thus, we found that inducible Treg-specific Tim-3 deletion results in a dramatic decrease in
both the growth of syngeneic tumors and the number of Treg infiltrating those tumors. However, Treg-specific
Tim-3 deletion did not detectably impact Treg development or immune tolerance under homeostatic conditions.
 Based on published and preliminary data, we hypothesize that Tim-3 is a critical regulator of effector Treg in
the tumor microenvironment. We will test this hypothesis with three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine
why there are fewer eTreg in the tumors of mice with Treg-specific Tim-3 KO. In Aim 2, we will define the effects
of loss of Treg Tim-3 on the tumor microenvironment. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine how the loss of Tim-3
on Treg impacts the response to PD-1 checkpoint blockade, in both mouse models, with an extension toward
the role of the interaction in the response to PD-1 blockade therapy in patients with head and neck cancer.
Together, these studies will provide the basis for more rational translation of Tim-3 as a target in the treatment
of solid tumors, in the context of existing checkpoint targets like PD-1. As such, these studies represent a logical
extension of work carried out in the previous cycle of this funded project."

We propose continued follow-up of our large, racially/ethnically diverse ECHO ELEGANT cohort (n=2130)
and to lead collaborative ECHO Cohort science. Our scientific aims focus on child obesity and adverse
neurodevelopment, two common and increasingly prevalent conditions. Our comprehensive planned analyses
take advantage of the core longitudinal data collected via the ECHO Cohort Protocol during the initial phase
and the new phase. In Aim 1, we will assess the role of in-utero exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds
(EDC) on child growth (growth trajectory), adiposity (body fat mass), obesity (body mass index [BMI]) and
neurodevelopment (autism, autism-related traits, and emotional-behavioral development [ND]), by addressing
solution oriented scientific questions that may promote precision interventions, practice recommendations and
policies. We will clarify the effects of two understudied classes of EDCs (perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and
contemporary organophosphate ester flame retardants (OPE)) and increase understanding of real-world
exposure scenarios by examining individual and joint effects. In Aim 2, we will clarify the joint effects of
multiple maternal prenatal overnutrition factors (high dietary energy intake/poor diet quality, high pre-
conception BMI, excessive gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes/diabetes) on child growth, adiposity,
obesity, and ND. While likely to co-occur, human studies on their joint effects on childhood obesity and ND are
sparse. Since child growth and development are dynamic processes, we will address the proposed
associations at different ages of the child. Our hypotheses are that prenatal exposure to EDCs and maternal
overnutrition factors adversely affect child growth, adiposity, obesity and ND by mechanistic pathways
(metabolomics, DNA methylation), and that maternal prenatal and child lifestyle behaviors, psychosocial
factors, social determinants of health, and sex assigned at birth may moderate these effects. In Aim 3 we will
maximize retention of our existing ECHO participants by implementing evidence-based strategies focused on
engaging diverse groups in clinical research and implementing the ECHO Cohort Protocol applying systematic
quality control approaches and best practices. Our experienced research team is very diverse, including
investigators from historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, disadvantaged backgrounds,
different career stages, multiple scientific fields, geographic locations, and institutions. We are committed to
providing equitable opportunities for all members of our research team to contribute to all aspects of our
proposed project and assure that they will have equal opportunity to be involved in the new ECHO phase. Our
continued involvement in ECHO provides an unparalleled opportunity to further understanding of the
developmental origins of child obesity and neurodevelopment and inform future interventions, prevention
strategies and policies to reduce the burden of these common and costly childhood disorders and possibly
their long-term impact on health across the lifespan."

facilitating information dissemination between research personnel. The third aim involves activities that will
facilitate recruitment and training of promising early career scientists into CARC labs that are focused on HIV

Community and Interpersonal Stress, Alcohol, and Chronic Comorbidities among PLWH
Aging persons living with HIV (PLWH) are a vulnerable population at higher risk for chronic illnesses and geriatric
syndromes (i.e., metabolic alterations, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, renal disease, and
osteoporosis). Higher levels of both psychosocial and physiological stress among PLWH have also been
associated with poorer immune status, increased viral load over time, faster disease progression, and higher
rates of mortality. Comorbid conditions in PLWH can be further exacerbated by at-risk alcohol use; and PLWH
are two to three times more at risk of alcohol use disorder (AUD). There is a critical need for a deeper
understanding of the roles that social determinants at the community and interpersonal levels play in chronic
comorbidities in PLWH. Neighborhoods and social spaces are important contexts through which social
determinants act to shape health and health behavior. However, there is a fundamental gap in current scientific
evidence-based knowledge about what people actually experience in these contexts, their impact on care for
PLWH, and how they may interact with other drivers of sub-optimal care such as at-risk alcohol use and clinical
comorbidities. Our preliminary data suggest a significant role of stress exposure at multiple levels on alcohol use
outcomes and comorbidities. The objective of Research Component 1 (RC1) is to determine the impact of
community and interpersonal stress on behavioral and chronic comorbidities among PLWH, and the unique role
that alcohol use plays in the pathways. Our central hypothesis is that exposure to stressors at the community
and interpersonal levels will impact clinical comorbidities, such as cardiometabolic and cognitive outcomes in
PLWH, through impacts on alcohol use and additional behavioral and coping mechanisms. Our approach will
involve the incorporation of individual level demographic and clinical data along with neighborhood data and
interpersonal exposures from PLWH and HIV- adults. We will incorporate advance modeling techniques to
determine the relation of individual, interpersonal, and community level measurable variables and latent
constructs, testing longitudinally the mediation of the effects by alcohol consumption. We will also explore in
depth individual space and time geographical momentary assessment (GMA) data collected from this cohort.
RC1’s proposed research links basic science with behavioral and social sciences, to epidemiology to determine
the role in alcohol in HIV-associated comorbidities. Our project will provide key data that will directly inform
multilevel interventions to improve the health of minority communities and neighborhoods that continually sustain
the biggest burden of HIV and associated comorbidities."

Alcohol and Metabolic Dysregulation in PLWH: Mechanisms Underlying Risk for Comorbidities
Reduced mortality rates with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and increased survival of persons living with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH), transformed HIV infection into a chronic disease that frequently coexists
with at-risk alcohol drinking. Increased longevity of PLWH is complicated with comorbidities that may be
exacerbated by at-risk alcohol consumption, unhealthy dietary behaviors, and ART adverse effects.
Compromised metabolic health is directly linked to greater risk for comorbidities afflicting PLWH and increases
progressively with time on ART. Data from our translational New Orleans Alcohol and HIV (NOAH) longitudinal
study of in-care PLWH show high prevalence of overweight, obesity, at-risk alcohol use, and poor dietary habits.
Subjects with at-risk alcohol use show greater incidence of impaired oral glucose tolerance. In addition, data
from chronic binge alcohol administered ART-treated simian immunodeficiency virus-infected nonhuman
primates (NHP) identified significant alterations in control (pancreas), effector (liver and adipose), and target
(muscle and bone) organ metabolic homeostatic mechanisms associated with impaired response to glucose
tolerance like that seen in the clinical setting. Collectively, published and preliminary clinical and preclinical data
collected by our team of investigators support the scientific premise that alcohol-induced early intestinal
pathogenesis promotes gut leak and immune activation promoting cellular energy metabolism dyshomeostasis.
We hypothesize metabolic dyshomeostasis underlies the increased risk for comorbidities in PLWH. Studies
proposed use a bidirectional translational approach to examine the mechanisms leading to metabolic instability
and how this is affected by at-risk alcohol consumption and consumption of a Western diet. The proposed
approach uses state-of-the-art techniques, combines in vivo with in vitro studies, and leverages our established
NHP model of HIV infection and the parallel NOAH clinical longitudinal study to examine the mechanisms
disrupted by alcohol in organs vital to the metabolic homeostatic axis in a virally-suppressed host. The expected
results will have a profound impact on identification of the underlying mechanisms of alcohol-associated
metabolic instability and will identify relevant targets for therapeutic interventions to ameliorate HIV/ART
associated metabolic derangements."
10746444,"Abstract LSUHSC CARC Research Component 3: Alcohol Use Disorder & Associated Neurological
Symptoms of Cognitive Dysfunction and Pain
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by neurological deficits, negative affective states, and a profound
escalation of drinking. The cognitive and behavioral deficits associated with excessive drinking are attributed to
functional and persistent changes to neuronal circuitry. Chronic alcohol induced-cognitive impairments are
associated with selective central nervous system damage in areas such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC).
Excessive alcohol exposure also damages the peripheral nervous system to produce a characteristic
neuropathy, and the resulting hyperalgesia (increased pain sensitivity) is hypothesized to potentiate negative
reinforcement processes to increase motivation for alcohol. Alcohol use also represents a major exacerbating
factor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Even in the post-antiretroviral therapy (ART) era
neurocognitive deficits remain prevalent in persons living with HIV (PLWH). HIV-associated neurocognitive
disorder (HAND) and co-occurring AUD can exacerbate these deficits. PLWH also suffer from chronic pain,
which disrupts physical and emotional function, interferes with ART adherence, and doubles the chance of
virologic failure. Pain symptoms in PLWH are associated with specific changes in the brain and correspondingly
associates with numerous psychosocial factors in this population, including depression. While cognitive deficits
and pain are closely linked in PLWH, few studies have examined the stress-related neurobiological factors that
drive these interactions or how alcohol and HIV promote this process. The PFC represents and executes the
highest forms of goal-directed behavior, and its function is compromised in motivational disorders such as AUD.
As a potential neurobiological correlate of pain and cognitive impairment in PLWH, preclinical studies from our
group and others have implicated a functional potentiation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling in
association with excessive alcohol drinking, cognitive dysfunction, and chronic pain. Heightened GR signaling
and altered excitability of vulnerable cognition- and pain-related brain areas such as the PFC may thus represent
a unifying mechanism contributing to these pathologies. Finally, emerging evidence suggests that Western diets
commonly consumed in the United States worsen both neurocognitive and pain symptomatology. Thus, the
neurobiological interaction of excessive alcohol drinking, cognition, and pain in the context of Western diet
consumption represents a critically underexplored area of HIV research in the public interest. Our overarching
hypothesis is that excessive drinking and HIV/ART exposure in individuals consuming a Western diet additively
produce cognitive deficits and hyperalgesia in PLWH in association with increased glucocorticoid signaling and
hyperexcitability within the PFC. We will examine these factors using a bidirectional translational experimental
design incorporating human and nonhuman primate models."
10746446,"RC4: PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 The HIV epidemic has transitioned from a rapidly fatal condition to a chronic manageable infection.
Persons living with HIV (PLWH) suffer an early onset of geriatric chronic diseases such as cardiovascular
disease, emphysema, cancers, and frailty. Often PLWH have multiple chronic conditions. Accelerated aging
and frailty best describe the health of PLWH. The origins of these health disparities are multifactorial but
include social, environmental, and economic challenges, and unhealthy behaviors including substance use.
Alcohol use disorders (AUDs), in particular, are highly prevalent in PLWH, interrupt the HIV care continuum,
and contribute to the pathogenesis of many comorbidities associated with HIV infection.
 In the preceding cycle of LSUHSC-New Orleans Comprehensive Alcohol-HIV/AIDS Research Center
(CARC), we confirmed that lifetime estimates of alcohol use in PLWH positively correlate with phenotypic frailty
and biological age in cross-sectional analyses of participants in the CARC’s New Orleans Alcohol Use in HIV
(NOAH) longitudinal study. Similarly, we found that alcohol use correlates with T-cell activation, senescence
and immune exhaustion. These findings support the importance of AUDs as a determinant of accelerated
aging in PLWH and are the premise for the studies proposed in the continuation of this research component
 Our primary hypothesis is that alcohol use disorder in PLWH increases CD8+ T-cell activation and
proliferation and reduces activation-induced cell death, leading to the accumulation of senescent cells. We
further hypothesize that long-term alcohol exposure results in cellular and tissue senescence leading to
clinical aging. We contend that alcohol increases cellular proliferation and decreases apoptosis leading to more
T-cell and tissue senescence. Senescent cells display a highly proinflammatory ‘senescence associated
secretory phenotype’ (SASP), which is thought to mediate tissue dysfunction to cause organ dysfunction and
frailty. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the role of alcohol use in mediating immune,
tissue, and organismal aging.
 Our hypotheses will be tested in bidirectional translational studies in PLWH and HIV-negative participants,
and in the chronic binge alcohol (CBA) simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) non-human primate (NHP) model.
Our experimental approach permits testing the impact of alcohol and HIV/SIV in cross-sectional and
longitudinal analyses. The Specific Aims of our proposed studies are: Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis
that alcohol use and HIV-infection increase T-cell senescence by increasing proliferation and decreasing
apoptosis; and Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that alcohol use and HIV-infection increase tissue
senescence and SASP leading to organ dysfunction and frailty. The expected outcome from this research is
validation of our conceptual model connecting alcohol use and precocious biological aging in PLWH. The long-
term goal of our research program is to mitigate multimorbidity and frailty due to alcohol use in PLWH."
10746426,"The critical preliminary data for this proposal is that contrary to the accepted dogma, following exposure to
endogenous immune adjuvants MyD88 delivers a negative signal to macrophages that limits tumor control by
radiation therapy. We demonstrate that in poorly immunogenic tumors, macrophages are rewired following
exposure to dying cancer cells such that they suppress multiple features of the tumor immune environment.
This includes the ability of T cells to control residual disease, and dendritic cell maturation. The aim of this
proposal is to understand the mechanisms by which this suppression occurs, identify the regulation of
macrophage suppression, and use this to identify patient populations that will respond poorly to current
therapies. We hypothesize that exposure to dying cells rewires macrophage signaling such that innate
activation of MyD88 suppresses local tumor immunity. The specific aims of this study are to 1: Test the
hypothesis that loss of MyD88 prevents NFKB driven-anti-inflammatory gene transcription and results in
increased IRF3 driven IFN transcription; 2: Test the hypothesis that signaling through Mertk-mediated ‘rewiring’
of macrophages changes the response to adjuvants limiting immune function in the tumor environment; and 3:
Test the hypothesis that MyD88 patterns of gene expression are linked to poor patient outcome. Our study
design incorporates CT-guided radiation therapy of multiple authentic pancreatic tumor models and using a
range of RT doses and fractionations. These are combined with unique knockouts and assays that allow us to
identify divergent myeloid responses in vitro and in vivo. Our analyses of clinical samples use high quality
bioinformatic approaches that allow us to evaluate effect of the tumor environment on the biological response
to innate adjuvants in patient samples."
10903883,"Accumulating evidence suggests that Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related inflammation
progresses in two different but interrelated compartments: the blood and the brain,
implying that leukocytes could lead to “brain activation,” while brain inflammation may
impact the peripheral system by inflammatory mediators. AD has predominantly chronic
neuroinflammation components that drive neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular
inflammation. However, recent studies have revealed that factors involved in acute
inflammatory response, neutrophils, contribute to pathology and cognitive impairment in
AD. Why and how neutrophils “invade” the AD-affected brain and contribute to ongoing
neurodegeneration is still largely unknown. The proposed study is designed to elucidate
critical cellular and molecular events regulating brain endothelial cell-neutrophil interaction
that can lead to neutrophil recruitment and occlusion of blood vessels and neutrophil
driven exacerbation of inflammatory processes in AD. Our preliminary data indicate that
junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A), a tight junction molecule that in inflammation
acts as a leukocyte adhesion molecule, is upregulated at the brain endothelium in AD.
Genetic manipulation of JAM-A as well as a specifically designed JAM-A antagonist
peptide reduced neutrophil infiltration and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation
in brain blood vessels and parenchyma and reduced behavioral deficits in a mouse AD
model. This proposal, therefore, highlights how JAM-A drives neutrophil-dependent
inflammatory responses in AD and specifically addresses the hypothesis that, “JAM-A
plays critical roles in neutrophil recruitment and NETs formation driving the
inflammatory and vascular injury in AD conditions”. Specifically, it will evaluate: a)
how a global JAM-A knockout affects vascular and parenchymal neutrophil accumulation
and behavioral outcomes in AD, b) the impact of endothelial-associated JAM-A on
vascular and parenchymal neutrophil accumulation and behavioral outcomes in AD, c) the
cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of JAM-A in AD and d)
the effects of JAM-A antagonist peptides on AD-induced neutrophil accumulation and
behavioral deficits. Collectively, these studies will provide new information related to the
mechanisms of neutrophil accumulation and NETs occurrence that is relevant not only to
AD but also to multiple disease states. Hopefully, this will help to elucidate novel
therapeutic strategies for treatment of AD-associated inflammation."
10903939,"COVID-19 pandemic highlights the impact of emerging infectious diseases and the global socioeconomic impact.
Alphaviruses such as the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has re-emerged along with many arthropod-borne viruses
(arboviruses) and these viruses continue to pose a significant threat to global human health especially with recent
vector expansion into non-endemic regions. CHIKV belongs to the Togaviridae family and is transmitted mainly
by Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti mosquitose. The bent-up posture caused by CHIKV fever disease and
the virus can be classified into three different lineages with distinct genotypes corresponding to their respective
geographical origins. CHIKV infections cause high serum viral loads, and therefore, high viremia also contributes
to rapid spread. Like other alphaviruses, there are no treatments for CHIKV and related viral infections. In recent
exploratory studies, we have identified two inhibitors that inhibit CHIKV and related alphavirus Mayaro virus
(MAYV). While prior studies have shown a potential role for HSP90 inhibitors, a major limitation associated with
further development of HSP90 inhibitors is that pan-HSP90 activity results in toxicity. HSP90 family consists of
4 different paralogs, two cytosolic forms HSP90α (encoded by HSP90AA1), HSP90β (encoded by HSP90AB1
gene), Grp94, an endoplasmic reticulum resident HSP90 (encoded by HSP90B1) and mitochondrial Trap1. While
pan-HSP90 activity provides the initial insights, they have many clinical liabilities. In our proposed studies, we
will develop HSP90β specific inhibitors with reduced toxicity and enhanced efficacy as a host-directed anti-
alphavirus therapeutic lead. We expect to move one or more scaffolds from hit-to-lead with selectivity index >200
and determine the mechanism of action (MOA). Collectively, we will fill a critical gap in the field."
10930887,"ABSTRACT
Wnts are a family of evolutionary conserved, secreted ligands that act at short range to coordinate morphogenetic
movements and cell fate decisions. Secretion of Wnt and subsequent recognition by its cognate receptor require
its O-palmitoleation in the endoplasmic reticulum. This modification is carried out by PORCN, that then transfers
Wnt to WLS, its dedicated integral membrane transporter. How WLS associates with Wnt in the ER, and
subsequently delivers it to the receptor Frizzled on the receiving cell remains largely unknown, and is the focus
of this Application.
Currently, there is a limited understanding of how WLS binds Wnts and transport them to the cell membrane.
Here we present as recently published data the structure of human WLS, in a complex with WNT8A, determined
using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to 3.2 Å resolution. The WLS membrane domain resembles a G
protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), albeit with one additional transmembrane helix. The O-palmitoleated Wnt
hairpin loop 2 inserts into a conserved central cavity of the GPCR-related domain, with the attached palmitoleate
protruding out into the lipid bilayer. Highly conserved patches on the outward-facing surfaces of the
transmembrane domain of WLS, adjacent to a hydrophobic gateway, suggest potential mechanisms for Wnt
transfer from PORCN and to Frizzled.
We propose to further study the interaction between WLS and Wnt, using the available structural information as
starting point. First, we will investigate how Wnt associate with WLS. We propose to determine the structure of
WLS in its apo – absent Wnt – state, as well as probe the putative site of entrance of Wnt into WLS by structure-
guided mutagenesis and biochemical assays. Our preliminary results suggest a direct interaction between WLS
and PORCN. Second, we will test how changes in sequence and glycosylation pattern can affect Wnt secretion
and destination, as well as the effect of pH on the interaction between the two proteins, using structure-guided
mutagenesis as well as Wnt transport and delivery assays in primary intestinal cells. Third, we propose to study
the release of Wnt to subsequent receptors. Our preliminary results suggest a direct interaction between WLS
and the Frizzled receptor, and we will test this hypothesis using detailed structure function analyses."

 Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. About 875,000 Americans die from heart
disease each year, of which 50-60% deaths are caused by coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD, the most
common type of heart disease, can lead to heart attack and sudden death. While the survival patients can
progress into chronic cardiomyopathy and heart failure (HF) that is featured with myocardial fibrosis.
Myocardial fibrosis is associated with adverse outcomes. Currently, there is no specific drugs for cardiac
fibrosis. Stem cell or exosome therapy has been a promising option for fibrotic disease. However, the
challenges in quality control and GMP-grade large-scale production as well as the elusive mechanisms have
hindered the translational application. One solution to address the challenges is to identify specific molecules
that underlie the antifibrotic mechanisms of exosomes, and design nanoparticle carriers to deliver them. In our
preliminary studies that form the basis of proposal, we found that transcription factor Tcf21 is crucial in
suppressing myofibroblast activation, and exosome cargo long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-TARID played as the
upstream enhancer of Tcf21 gene expression. Recently, the application of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) has
expanded in a large scope of clinical trials for nucleic acid delivery. In this proposal, we aim to develop lncRNA
LNP for treatment of cardiac fibrosis. The overarching hypothesis is that LNPs loaded with lncRNA-TARID
(LNP-TARID) can upregulate Tcf21 to suppress myocardial fibrosis and improve cardiac functions. Our original
grant focuses on microRNA cargos in the exosomes, such as miR-21 and miR-146. From the sequencing
experiments, we serendipitously encountered other non-coding RNAs in the exosomes that play an essential
role in cardiac repair. LncRNA TARID is one of them. Our preliminary studies confirmed the therapeutic role of
LncRNA TARID in cardiac fibrosis. Our renewal submission will be focusing on this RNA agent, using LNP as
the delivery carrier. Aim 1: Optimization of LNP-TARID formulations and in vitro characterization; toxicity
studies in naïve animals. Aim 2: Determine the safety and efficacy of LNP-TARID treatment in mouse models
of acute and chronic MI. Aim 3: Translate the LNP-TARID therapy into a clinically-relevant pig model of
cardiac I/R injury. Our proposal is both mechanism-driven and product-oriented. The results from our research
will pave the ground for the development of new non-coding RNA therapies to treat myocardial infarction and
help us gain mechanistic insights on the Tcf21-regulated cardiac fibrosis pathways."
10749040,"Project Summary
 Electronic biosensors have been playing increasingly important roles in medical diagnostics. Early
detections of various biomarkers are desired to provide timely diagnosis for the prevention and treatment of
diseases. However, current electronic biosensors are limited in biodetection, often attributed to nonspecific
interferences from a complicated ionic environment in bodily solutions. Specifically, charge screening has
prevented field-effect biosensors from real-time biodetection in physiological environment. We intend to bring
in and validate a new biosensor concept, which can be free of nonspecific charge interference and provide
generic solution to the specific biodetection. We also intend to apply the biosensor in the early detection of tick-
borne diseases, which have imposed serious threat to public health but lacked means in early detection for
timely treatment. Inspired by the mechanotransduction in biological organelles, we will employ a
`mechanogating' sensing mechanism that is orthogonal and hence resilient to charge interference. Specifically,
we propose to design a biosensor based on a suspended nanotransistor exposed to analyte flow; the binding
biomolecules are expected to increase the effective cross-sectional area of the nanotransistor and hence the
drag force by the fluid flow; the induced strain will lead to a conductance change through the piezoresistance
effect.
 To realize the goals, in Aim 1 we will assembly and integrate highly suspended nanotransistors as the
biosensors specifically designed for the proposed sensing mechanism. In Aim 2, we will evaluate and verify the
biosensor function and performance in high ionic strength mimicking the physiological environment. In Aim 3,
we will implement the biosensor for the selective detection of pathogens of tick-borne diseases. If successful,
the biosensor will provide a practical solution for improved/timely treatment in tick-borne diseases. The
research is expected to create a new class of biosensors, which will transcend the inability of field-effect
biosensors and realize generic biodetection in physiological environment, leading to advanced biomedical
devices for versatile point-of-care diagnostics."
10749047,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recently, it has become apparent that mechanical cues in the cellular microenvironment drive cell migration,
stem cell differentiation into distinct cell types and even how a surveilling T-cells is triggered by its correct antigen,
solidifying tension-sensing as a key regulatory switch in cellular function. Not surprisingly, alteration of
mechanical forces is an emerging factor in diseases like cancer, which makes intuitive sense given that diagnosis
often involves detecting a lump that feels harder and stiffer than the surrounding tissue. Indeed, distinct and
quantifiable “mechanical phenotypes” of normal and diseased cells/tissues have been measured. Underlying
these cellular “mechanical phenotypes” characteristic of normal and diseased cellular microenvironments are
mechanosensing proteins that convert sensed physical perturbations into biochemical signals in a process
known as mechanotransduction. These signaling pathways are putative targets of emerging “mechano-
therapeutic” strategies aimed to correct aberrant mechanical phenotypes. The overall vision of the Gordon lab
is to innovate technology to identify the molecular players underlying disease-relevant mechanical-phenotypes,
and dissect their tension-sensing mechanisms to cure disease. The greatest challenge to determining the
molecular basis of force sensing is that the technology to measure picoNewton (pN) forces sensed by an
individual protein in the context of the cell emerged only ten years ago, and is still under constant development.
This has crippled identification of new mechanosensing proteins involved in a given cellular or disease process
and also left a huge gap in testable hypotheses regarding how force alters the conformation of receptors to
trigger a biological response. Our lab has established three major areas to tackle this problem that blend
technology development and hypothesis driven questions. Program I. In combination with cellular imaging, we
develop and use molecular tension sensors (MTS) to measure forces sensed by hypothesized mechanosensing
proteins in the cellular context. We plan to combine MTS and CRISPR screens to identify mechanosensors
involved in glioblastoma and T-cell migration. Program II. Second, we aim to test the hypothesis that proteolysis
of receptors is a mechanism to convey mechanical stimuli. We will use structural biophysics to study newly
identified Notch-like proteolytic switches and use CRISPR-tagging and mass spectrometry to study global
receptor proteolysis in response to applied force. Program III. Finally, our lab has expanded into a third area-
function and application of HUH-endonucleases as “HUH-tags” to covalently link proteins and DNA. We plan to
engineer sequence specificity and RNA-binding of HUH-tags. We are poised to use HUH-tags to improve DNA-
based MTS and to link mechanosensing-domains to DNA-nanostructures to coax proteins into mechanically
activated conformations. The interleaving of new protein-DNA conjugation technology with hypothesis driven
research drives creative and innovative approaches to important problems in biomedical science and medicine.

10747498,"According to the DoD/VA Extremity Amputation Center of Excellence there were about 3,000
Veterans with transradial amputations enrolled for VA Healthcare in FY21. Veterans with arm
amputations from Post-911 conflicts number just over 200, and because the total number of
Veterans missing arms is demographically small, this very fact has limited innovation. Prosthetic
arms are often uncomfortable which is generally attributable to the fit and comfort of sockets and
harnesses and are not worn primarily for this reason. This research seeks to validate and improve
upon preliminary results from an innovative new transradial socket and harness textile-based
design inspired by advanced athletic shoe technology. We propose to employ a participatory action
design and engineering (PADE) process for the proposed K-Socket-Harness (KSH) to include
three basic phases: (1) Advance the current KSH design for manufacture and to be suitable for a
broader population of Veterans with transradial amputations; (2) Evaluate the improved KSH
design(s) with a selection of experienced Veterans with a range of different lengths and anatomies
of transradial amputations and revise design based on their guidance; (3) Enroll a larger cohort to
compare the improved KSH design to Veteran’s current prosthetic device through a series of
activities designed to illicit differences if they exist. In Phases 1-3, we will recruit 5 experienced
Veterans with transradial arm amputations to provide guidance and to assist with the design and
development. In Phase - 3, We will recruit an additional 20 Veterans with transradial arm
amputations to undergo a series of evaluative tests. We will recruit 5 Certified Prosthetists with at
least 5-years of experience working with Veterans with transradial arm amputations to provide
guidance and to assist with the design and development. If successful, the resulting KSH will
provide an alternative for Veterans or augment current devices provided to improve function and
reduce risk of injury. This study will employ an iterative PADE process involving input from
Veterans with disabilities at various stages to inform the development and acceptance of KSH.
KSH will be tested for usability and feasibility for improving comfort, function, acceptance, and
range of motion. Experienced end-user Veterans and Clinical staff will be engaged to assist with
design, develop the fitting process. Acceptance of prosthetic arms has long been a problem for
clinical prosthetics, and recent studies indicate that recent advancements have done little to
improve usage. Athletic footwear has evolved to accomplish many of the same difficult, diverse,
and even contradictory tasks that face prosthetic upper limb socket design, and footwear design
and production has evolved remarkably. With sufficient understanding of both shoe technology
and prosthetic requirements, we can accrue to upper-limb prosthetics all the benefits of the
modern materials and design/manufacturing techniques of the athletic shoe industry. Prosthetic
arms are an orphan medical device, and their improvement is both a very difficult problem, and
one shared by too small a population to create traditional economic incentives or an obvious
business case. We have submitted a full patent application for the Variable Compliance Socket
technology developed so far, patent application US16/974,120, published 30 September 2021. It
is our hope that if this research and development results in improved technology of demonstrated
efficacy that the VA can assert leadership in providing it to Veterans and helping establish its use
in the civilian market, as has happened with other prosthetic technology."
10917421,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Ischemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (iLVSD) is a leading cause of heart failure (HF) and death, for which
risk is greatest in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD). Coronary revascularization (revasc)
provides a potential means to improve iLVSD, but response is highly variable. “Viability” imaging (to differentiate
infarcted from salvageable myocardium) had been widely touted as a tool to predict revasc response, but its
utility has been challenged by recent clinical trials. One reason for observed lack of utility of imaging to predict
LV functional recovery after revasc may stem from imaging approaches used to define viability: No prior trial has
accounted for contractile dysfunction, hypoperfusion, or non-ischemic substrate in seemingly viable regions –
each of which can be uniquely discerned by cardiac MRI (CMR). Our group has conducted single center studies
showing transmural extent of infarction to be a powerful predictor of improved LV function after revasc; we have
also shown hypoperfusion to predict adverse remodeling and prognosis. Technical research by members of our
group has developed a new late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) CMR approach that uses blood suppression
(“dark-blood”) to better discriminate between infarct and blood-pool – potentially further enhancing viability as-
sessment. It is unknown if differential impact of revasc strategy on LV contractile recovery varies in relation to
infarct or perfusion phenotype, if non-ischemic substrate (extracellular volume fraction, epicardial or mid-wall
LGE) modifies revasc response, and if LV contractile recovery parallels improved prognosis. To address these
critical knowledge gaps, this observational study will leverage the newly initiated STICH3C trial - a prospective
multicenter trial comparing percutaneous (PCI) vs. surgical (CABG) revasc for patients with iLVSD and mul-
tivessel/left main CAD. Perfusion CMR will be performed pre- (<1 month) and post-revasc (12 months) in 200
STICH3C patients and analyzed via a centralized core lab. Our central hypothesis is that infarct transmurality
(LGE) and hypoperfusion will predict LV contractile response (EF) and prognosis (QOL, HF, mortality) after re-
vasc, for which treatment effect of CABG vs. PCI on LV recovery will increase in proportion to viable but hy-
poperfused myocardium on CMR. Aim 1 will test infarct transmurality and hypoperfusion for prediction of LV
recovery (improved ejection fraction, strain) after revasc; Aim 2 will evaluate if non-ischemic tissue substrate
modifies likelihood of LV contractile recovery; Aim 3 will test prognostic impact of infarction, hypoperfusion, and
non-ischemic substrate after revasc, with focus on residual myocardial tissue properties as predictors of persis-
tent LV dysfunction, impaired quality of life, and clinical events (HF readmission, mortality). Our team provides
complementary expertise in key project relevant areas - translational CMR research, cardiac surgery, heart fail-
ure, and clinical trials - and a track record of productive collaboration. Study findings are well-poised to transform
the imaging paradigm through which viability is assessed and inform mechanism for persistent LV dysfunction,
so as to improve therapeutic decision-making and clinical outcomes for millions of patients with iLVSD."
10902009,"Abstract:
White blood cell (WBC) counts and neutrophil counts are among the most commonly used medical tests. WBC
counts and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) are monitored closely in the setting of myelosuppressive therapy,
and neutropenia is often the dose limiting toxicity when dosing chemotherapy. An elevated WBC count is also
used in helping to diagnose and infection and risk stratifying patients with acute bacterial infections. Therefore,
accurate interpretation of the WBC and neutrophil count is crucial in many branches of medicine. WBC and
neutrophil counts vary substantially by race and ethnicity. African Americans, Latinos with African ancestry and
some Middle Eastern populations have lower WBC and lower ANC. We have previously mapped the genetic
variant underlying this difference. The variant maps to the promoter region of the Duffy Antigen Receptor
Chemokine (DARC/ACKR1) locus and results in lack of expression of the DARC antigen on the surface of red
blood cells. The allele which leads to loss of expression (Fya-/b- or Fy-) is the predominant allele in West Africa,
but rare outside of Africa and the Middle East. Individuals with Fy-/- genotype have WBC and ANC that is > 1
standard deviation lower than individuals with the other genotype. Despite over a decade of knowledge about
this effect, there has been little progress on incorporating this into clinical care. As a result, patients with this
genotype who are predominantly African American in the U.S. may receive lower doses of myelosuppressive
therapies and may be more likely to have reduced relative dose intensity of chemotherapy which may lead to
disparities in outcomes. Since WBC and ANC are used to diagnose and make prognostic inferences among
patients with infection, their care in the setting of severe infections may suffer. Therefore, large studies with
outcomes are needed to help guide clinicians on how to treat these patients. We propose to leverage large
biobanks tied to electronic health records to determine outcomes of patients on myelosuppressive therapies with
this genotype and to determine how to use WBC and ANC in the setting of infection. (1) We will examine
outcomes of patients on chronic myelosuppressive therapies by genotype. We will determine whether Fy-/-
genotype is associated with high incidence of neutropenia on myelosuppressive therapies and whether this leads
to dose reductions. We will examine the risk of infectious complications among patients with Fy-/- on
myelosuppressive therapies. (2) We will examine outcomes of patients on chemotherapy according to genotype.
We will determine if genotype is associated with relative dose intensity of chemotherapy and whether this is
associated with differences in overall survival among these patients. We will determine if infectious complications
are associated with genotype among patients on chemotherapy. (3) We will examine how WBC and neutrophil
to lymphocyte count ratios vary in the setting of acute infections and how this affects diagnostic and prognostic
use of these parameters. Our project will help clinicians optimize myelosuppressive therapy and diagnosis of
infection among the large number of individuals with this genotype."
10754904,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer in the United States. Though CRC cases in adults
(55 and older) have decreased, the incidence of CRC in young adults, ages 15-40, is on an alarming rise. It is
estimated that by the year 2030, a staggering 11-12% increase in early-onset (EO) cancers will be observed.
Adult cases of CRC typically harbor driver mutations in Apc, a tumor suppressor that regulates Wnt signaling, in
addition to second hits in Kras, Braf, p53 and Smad4. Apc mutations are also found in early-onset CRC (EO-
CRC), but a decrease in the typical second hit driver pathways has been reported. Therefore, there is an urgent
need to better define the root cause of EO-CRC. Moreover, clinical evidence suggests that diet is likely a root
underlying cause of the increased incidence in sporadic cases of EO-CRC. Interestingly, dietary challenge and
timing of food intake directly impinge on the circadian clock, which is our internal pacemaker that governs
sleep/wake cycles, feeding, hormonal and other cyclic rhythms. This suggests that disruption of the circadian
clock could be a major risk factor for EO cancers. In further support of this idea, clinical data indicates that clock
genes are broadly downregulated in human colorectal tumors, suggesting that suppression of the clock could be
important for transformation in the intestinal epithelium. To directly address the potential links between the clock
and CRC, we have developed a novel genetic mouse model to define how disruption of the circadian clock drives
CRC pathogenesis. Our preliminary data demonstrates that disruption of the clock in the intestinal epithelium
drives a statistically significant increase in polyp formation. Using our mouse model system, organoid cultures
reveal that clock disruption accelerates transformation in the intestinal epithelium. Based on these findings, we
hypothesize that clock disruption impinges on intestinal transformation and rewires cellular metabolism to sustain
the heightened demand of hyperproliferative cells. Aim 1 will define how the clock machinery regulates genome
instability and transformation in the intestine. Aim 2 will determine the role of the circadian clock in governing
metabolism of intestinal epithelial cells in both mouse and human organoid systems, established from EO-CRC
patient samples. Aim 3 will delineate how dietary paradigms that disrupt the circadian clock accelerate intestinal
transformation. The broader impact of our findings will outline new prevention strategies for eradicating EO-CRC
and other cancers that potentially relate to disruption of the circadian clock. Additionally, our long-term goal is to
achieve targeted pharmacological approaches to regulate the circadian clock and therefore minimize behavioral
and lifestyle factors that potentially impinge on tumorigenesis."
10883659,"Abstract
 Mayaro virus (MAYV) is the second leading cause of alphavirus-induced febrile illness in South American
countries. In recent years, MAYV has gained significant attention because its geographic distribution is
expanding north from South and Central America into the Caribbean Islands. While sporadic cases of MAYV
were reported in past years, it is still unclear why MAYV outbreaks of considerable proportion are now being
recognized more frequently in Latin America and what factors are accounting for the expansion of the virus to
new geographic areas. Recently, eco-epidemiological investigations have confirmed the presence of naturally
infected Aedes aegypti in Brazil. This raises the possibility that adaptation of MAYV to be better transmitted by
urban vectors is a major contributing factor to the emergence and expansion of this pathogen. Thus, studies are
urgently needed to assess this possibility.
 Given the expansion of MAYV into new geographic areas and the evidence supporting urban transmission,
we conducted vector competence studies with Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus and MAYV strains isolated
during years of low (2002) or high MAYV transmission (2011) in Peru. We observed that a MAYV strain isolated
during an outbreak in 2011 had greater frequency of infection, dissemination, and transmission in both Aedes
aegypti and Aedes albopictus, whereas minimal to no transmission was detected with the strain isolated in 2002,
a year of low MAYV transmission. In the studies of this proposal, we hypothesize that MAYV is adapting to be
better transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus and that evolutionary changes in the E2 glycoprotein
of the MAYV genome promote enhanced infectivity in these mosquito vectors. We will: 1) examine the vector
competence of urban vectors for circulating MAYV strains in Peru, using a susceptible animal model and 2)
conduct genetic studies to assess E2 glycoprotein mutations and their contribution to vector competence.
Completion of this study will provide critical knowledge to our understanding of MAYV transmission and will
identify and experimentally validate viral genes associated with enhanced transmission. It will also generate
powerful tools, including the development of reverse genetic systems, for studying other aspects of MAYV
infection. Therefore, this project represents an important step towards our long-term objective of understanding
the emergence mechanism of MAYV."

Evidence-based medicine faces increasingly mounting challenges. With the explosively growing scientific
literature, it will be harder than ever to identify the best evidence available, especially given the large volume of
non-traditional and emerging sources of evidence: e.g., evidence derived from trial registries and data
repositories; observational datasets; publications without peer review; and scientific blogging. Individual studies
using conventional methods for evidence generation, especially randomized controlled trials, may be significantly
flawed in their planning, conduct, analysis, or reporting, resulting in ethical violations, wasted scientific resources,
and dissemination of misinformation with subsequent health harm. Furthermore, a new randomized controlled
trial should be initiated or interpreted in the context of the existing evidence. However, clinical evidence
extraction, appraisal, and aggregation remain laborious human tasks given its free-text format. To support
evidence-based research so that new research hypothesis selection and testing can be well-grounded on the
existing scientific literature and existing evidence can be easily accessible and computable to researchers,
patients, or clinicians, we will develop novel, scalable, and generalizable methods for clinical evidence extraction
and appraisal so that we can help the public identify reliable evidence easily. We will contribute computable
evidence representations and accompanying natural language processing pipelines, achieving symbiosis
between the two to support core tasks for evidence-based medicine, such as faceted evidence retrieval (e.g.,
“retrieve all the randomized controlled trials publications about the efficacy of HCQ on severe COVID-19 patients,
with each study having a sample size over 200”), extraction and representation of clinical findings (e.g., “HCQ
for people infected with COVID-19 has little or no effect on the risk of death, and probably no effect on
progression to mechanical ventilation”), and evidence quality ranking and biases detection.
Therefore, we propose four specific aims:
Aim 1. — Represent and extract Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) information.
Aim 2. — Represent and extract clinical findings and their metadata relevant for evidence quality ranking
and study biases detection.
Aim 3. — Develop and validate an extensible living clinical evidence knowledge graph based on the FAIR
principles.
Aim 4. — Develop and validate an Augmented Intelligence (AI) system for evidence appraisal.
INNOVATION There is no scalable and generalizable informatics solution for literature-based, fine-grained
clinical evidence extraction and representation, evidence quality ranking, evidence biases detection, and user-
augmented clinical evidence aggregation and appraisal. ClinEX will be the first solution to achieve these goals."

The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language
processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an
interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss
the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this
language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language
processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic
processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery,
neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this renewal proposal, we continue with two initiatives implemented in the
first cycle of the grant which have been very successful and introduce a third initiative (“Fireside Chats on
equity in science”) to continue to build the research and training caliber of young aphasia researchers.
We continue our first initiative that involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the
field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary
backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific
feedback about the mentee’s presentation and general mentorship to the mentee about research and
academic careers. This program has received very positive feedback in the past five years of the grant cycle
with long term benefits for the young researchers. The second initiative we continue will be an hour-long
seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state-of-the-art
methodology, that has an application to the study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of
aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists
and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. The third and new initiative will be a
“Fireside Chat on Equity in Science” where each year we discuss aspects of equity in science. Our inaugural
meeting in 2022 started an important discussion on the under-representation and under-citation of publication
from women and minorities in neuroscience/neurology fields. Over the five years, we will invite editors of
journals, reviewers on different funding panels to encourage dialog about how to reduce explicit and implicit
bias in academia and encourage science from underrepresented minorities in the field.
In the last five years, the NIDCD program has changed the fabric and energy at the conference for the better
and has established a process to ensure a pipeline of highly talented and trained scientists pursuing a
research or clinical career with strong foundations in interdisciplinary research on aphasia. This renewal
application continues this important work."

 Abnormal Wnt/β-catenin signaling is associated with various types of human cancers, most notably
colorectal cancers (CRCs) due to APC and CTNNB1 (β-catenin) mutations. CRCs are the third most common
cancer worldwide and the fourth most common cause of death. Wnt/β-catenin signaling exhibits its oncogenic
activities by inducing the expression of Wnt target genes such as CCND1 (Cyclin D1) and MYC (c-Myc) through
β-catenin/T cell factor (Tcf)-mediated transcription. Although APC and CTNNB1 mutations play a critical role in
human CRC initiation and development, emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic modifications act
synergistically in human CRC initiation and development. A small subset of cancer stem cells (CSCs) or cancer
initiating cells with the ability to self-renew and maintain the tumor has been isolated from human CRCs. We and
others have found that β-catenin/Tcf-mediated transcription is hyperactivated in human colorectal CSCs
compared to non-CSC tumor cells. In this application, we identified that lysine-specific demethylase 4B (KDM4B)
that erases H3K9me3 marks was highly expressed in human CRCs. The knockdown or pharmacological
inhibition of KDM4B in human CRC cells significantly inhibited the expression of Wnt target genes. To explore
the functional roles of KDM4B in vivo, we generated Kdm4bflox/flox (Kdm4bf/f) mice that carry conditional Kdm4b
alleles. Although the deletion of Kdm4b in mice causes intestinal abnormalities and reduced crypt stem cells,
unlike the deletion of β-catenin, we found that mice can tolerate KDM4B deficiency, indicating that targeting
KDM4B might provide a safe therapeutic window for the treatment of human CRCs. Consistently, we found that
the intestinal deletion of Kdm4b completely inhibited intestinal tumorigenesis in ApcMin/+ mice which develop
multiple adenomas in the small intestine due to increased β-catenin/Tcf-mediated transcription. Additionally, we
found that KDM4B interacts with the intestinal stem cell transcription factor ASCL2 which serve as a positive
feedback to enhance β-catenin/Tcf-mediated transcription. Based on these exciting discoveries, we hypothesize
that KDM4B might epigenetically control Wnt/β-catenin-mediated oncogenesis and is required for the
tumorigenic potentials of human colorectal CSCs. Using molecular, cellular, genetic and epigenetic approaches,
we will determine: 1) Whether the knockout or pharmacological inhibition of KDM4B inhibits CRC tumorigenesis
in vivo; 2) Whether KDM4B epigenetically controls tumorigenic potentials and self-renewal of CSCs in human
CRCs; 3) How KDM4B epigenetically controls Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcription and tumorigenesis by
erasing H3K9me3. Since histone demethylases are enzymes which can be readily targeted by small molecules
inhibitors, novel findings from our studies may lead to develop novel strategies for the treatment of human CRCs
and other cancers."

Diseases that arise from mutations in components of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation can be
devastating, as mitochondria are crucial for energy synthesis. These diseases occur predominantly in infants
and children, with a prevalence of 1 in 5000. Though virtually any organ can be affected, the heart is frequently
involved, because cardiac function has such high energy requirements. These mitochondrial
cardiomyopathies have a particularly grim prognosis, with mortality rates increased nearly three-fold
compared to children without cardiac involvement, and no specific therapies available. In linking cardiac
function to mitochondrial metabolism, calcium signaling may be central to the pathological process. Calcium
influx into the mitochondria can potently stimulate ATP synthesis. In the initial period of this application, we
identified a regulatory mechanism by which dysfunction within Complex I of the electron transport chain
causes a compensatory increase in activity of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter channel, preserving ATP
synthesis. During normal physiology, Complex I promotes uniporter degradation via an interaction with the
uniporter, a mechanism we term Complex I-induced protein turnover (CLIPT). During Complex I dysfunction,
interaction with the uniporter is inhibited, preventing degradation and leading to a build-up in functional
channels. This mechanism is widespread and was seen in fruit flies, mice, and humans. Moreover, while
inhibiting the uniporter led to early demise in Complex I-deficient animals, enhancing uniporter stability
rescued survival and function. In this project period, we propose the following three aims to further study this
pathway and determine whether it can be exploited for potential therapeutic benefit. We focus on
mitochondrial one-carbon (1C) metabolism, a producer of mitochondrial antioxidant species (NAPDH),
because this pathway is substantially upregulated in mitochondrial cardiomyopathies. In the first aim, we will
examine if adenine dinucleotides (NAD+/NADP+) regulate the uniporter, and if calcium regulates critical 1C
metabolism enzymes. In the second aim, we will establish whether uniporter activity in mitochondrial
cardiomyopathies extends beyond ATP synthesis to NADPH biology, affecting redox balance and one-carbon
metabolism. In the third aim, we will test whether manipulation of the portion of the uniporter that interacts
with Complex I, the uniporter N-terminal domain (NTD), can be exploited in mouse models as a potential
therapy for mitochondrial cardiomyopathies."
10906019,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer and can drive high rates of chromosome segregation errors during
mitotic cell division, which can generate abnormal structures called micronuclei that entrap mis-segregated
chromosomes. Micronuclei are susceptible to massive DNA damage, triggering the catastrophic pulverization of
the entrapped chromosome into small DNA fragments, a process termed chromothripsis. In addition to
generating genomic rearrangements that drive cancer development, DNA fragments from micronuclei can also
mis-accumulate and persist in the cytoplasm. These cytoplasmic DNAs are detected by the cytosolic DNA sensor
cGAS, resulting in the cell-autonomous activation of the STING pathway to trigger an innate immune response.
Although the cGAS-STING signaling mechanisms are well defined, the fate of cytoplasmic DNAs following
recognition by cGAS remains a critical knowledge gap. Here I propose to investigate non-cell autonomous roles
of cytoplasmic DNAs, which hold critical implications in how genomically unstable cancer cells can elicit inter-
cellular responses with the tumor microenvironment. I hypothesize that cytoplasmic DNAs derived from
fragmented chromosomes in micronuclei become exported for uptake by neighboring cells. To test this
hypothesis, I will leverage an experimental system enabling chromosome-specific induction of micronuclei and
cytoplasmic DNA followed by tracking of specific cytoplasmic DNA fragments that harbor a selectable marker.
In Aim 1, I will determine whether and how cytoplasmic DNAs are released into the extracellular environment to
facilitate non-cell autonomous activation of the cGAS-STING pathway in adjacent cells. I will further determine
whether extracellular DNA derived from the cytoplasm of host cells can be taken up by recipient cells, which will
be monitored by live-cell imaging using a dCas9-based cytoplasmic DNA reporter. In Aim 2, I will track the
incorporation of cytoplasmic DNAs into recipient cell nuclei and determine whether these fragments can integrate
into the host genome. This will be studied using a combination of cytogenetics and whole-genome sequencing
to investigate the possibility of lateral DNA transfer between human cells. Despite occurring frequently in
bacteria, inter-cellular DNA transfer has been a longstanding challenge to test in the context of human cancer.
These studies have potential for broad impact by advancing our understanding of cancer cell interactions,
including the transfer of oncogenes and/or mutations from chromosomally unstable cancer cells to non-cancer
cells in the tumor microenvironment."

10753579,"Project Summary/Abstract
American Indians (AIs) have the highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) of any racial or ethnic group and
experience high rates of co-morbidities such as obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and chronic kidney
disease (CKD). Uncontrolled cardio-metabolic risk factors--insulin resistance resulting in impaired glucose
tolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension (HTN)--increase mortality risk. Mortality is significantly reduced by
glucose- and lipid-lowering, and antihypertensive medication adherence. Medication adherence is low among
AIs living in non-Indian Health Services (IHS) healthcare settings. Virtually nothing is known about the nature
and extent of medication adherence among reservation-dwelling AIs who primarily receive their medications
without cost from IHS/tribal facilities. Electronic health records (EHR) offer a rich but underutilized data source
about medication adherence and its potential to predict Cardio-Metabolic Control Indicators (C-MCI) such
as HbA1c, LDL-C (Low Density Lipoprotein), SBP (Systolic Blood Pressure). With the support of Choctaw
Nation of Oklahoma (CNO), we will address this oversight by using EHR data generated by this large, state-of-
the-art tribal healthcare system to investigate C-MCI. The objective of our R01 application is to characterize
the relationships among medication adherence (antihypertensive, glucose- and lipid-lowering drugs) and C-
MCI (HbA1c ≤7%, LDL-C <100 mg/dL, and SBP <130 mm Hg), patient demographics (e.g., age, sex, SDOH,
residence location) and co-morbidities (e.g., CVD, BMI>30, CKD) as well as the relationship of each C-MCI
with patient demographics and co-morbidities from the tribe's EHR (2018-2021) for the 5,970 CNO
patients who have T2D. Employing machine learning techniques, we will develop models to predict future
(2019-2021) C-MCI based on the previous year medication adherence, patient demographics, co-
morbidities, and common labs (e.g., lipid panel). Lastly, key informant interviews will explore facilitators of
and barriers to medication adherence within the context of local social determinants of health (SDOH) that are
not available in the EHR. Our specific aims are to: (1) Determine the bivariate relationships between (a)
medication adherence and C-MCIs, demographics, and co-morbidities; (b) each C-MCI and demographics and
co-morbidities; (2) Develop machine-learning models (e.g., random forest, nearest neighbors, others) for
predicting future (2019-2021) C-MCI from the previous year medication adherence, demographics, co-
morbidities, and common labs; and (3) Identify facilitators of and barriers to medication adherence within the
context of SDOH, EHR-derived medication adherence (PDC) and C-MCI (at target, above target, and for
HbA1c uncontrolled). We will share our findings with CNO leaders and other stakeholders, who will guide the
translation of the results into recommendations for evaluating T2D management and complication prevention
programs. Our findings will yield insights to improve medication adherence and C-MCI among AIs, consistent
with CNO's State of the Nation's Health Report 2017 goal of reducing T2D and its complications."
10753590,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
RNA processing is an essential cellular process that when dysregulated underlies the development of
neurological diseases. Several mutations in nuclease containing complexes cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia
(PCH), a severe neurological disorder that often leads to prenatal death. Most cases of PCH are linked to
mutations in the tRNA Splicing Endonuclease (TSEN) Complex, which is responsible for the cleavage of tRNA
introns prior to tRNA maturation, and its accessory protein, CLP1, which is a critical negative regulator of tRNA
splicing. Genetic deletion of any single TSEN protein in yeast, engineered to have tRNAs without introns, was
shown to be lethal, suggesting that the TSEN complex likely has substrates beyond the tRNAs, which may
underlie the development of PCH. Likewise, mutations in another nuclease, target of Egr 1 (TOE1), a
deadenylase and 3’-exonuclase, are also are linked to PCH. TOE1 is the only deadenylase believed to mature
snRNAs, but it also moonlights in other cellular pathways, highlighting how much is yet to understand about its
role in protein complexes.
 To determine how mutations in TOE1, CLP1, and TSEN proteins lead to PCH, there remains a critical
need to understand how these complexes assemble, recognize and process RNAs, and how their enzymatic
activity is regulated. Characterizing healthy cellular roles of these proteins is essential to determining how their
dysfunction causes PCH. We aim to address these critical questions through the following proposed Aims. In
Aim 1, Structural and molecular techniques will be used to identify how the TSEN complex recognizes and
processes tRNAs and other RNA substrates. In Aim 2, we will determine how the CLP1/TSEN complex are
regulated at the molecular and cellular level and how PCH mutations disrupt their regulation. Further, in Aim 3,
we will identify how PCH mutations alter TOE1 function and regulation, using proteomics and molecular biology
approaches.
 The proposed work is significant because it will provide a structural description for how known PCH
mutations may interfere with complex formation, stability, or function for a range of PCH-linked proteins. This
work will further provide insight into shared mechanisms by which these protein complexes cause PCH.
Furthermore, the work here will characterize new RNA processing roles for these nucleases."

Kidney diseases affect 37 million Americans, placing them at major risk for cardiovascular events, other co-
morbidities, and death. While there have been exciting recent advances in our field, to impact these staggering
numbers, it is critical to identify new therapeutic targets, expand our understanding of disease pathogenesis and
develop new methods to target specific cell types in the kidney. To do this, we must push disciplinary boundaries,
build new discovery platforms and partner with orthogonal disciplines. A major unmet challenge in kidney
research is the dearth of technologies and platforms that can incorporate the complexity and diversity of kidney
structure, cellular phenotypes and function in their design and execution. The proposed Northwestern
University National Resource Center (NU-NRC) will meet this challenge by leveraging innovations in the
physical sciences to provide unique tools, reagents, and platforms to kidney researchers. By design, these
resources take advantage of tissue and cellular diversity, making them powerful technologies for discovery-
based kidney research and therapeutic development.
The overarching theme of the NU-NRC is to adapt powerful physical sciences theory, tools, platforms, and
approaches to advance kidney investigation in a Physical Sciences-Kidney Resource Center. The major
goals of the Center are to A) harness physical science advances to provide new approaches to solve unmet
challenges in kidney research and discovery, and B) to provide easy access to physical science tools, reagents
and platforms to the broader kidney community to catalyze their research and spur innovation. We will
accomplish these goals through four specific aims: 1. Establish a Biomedical Resource Core focused on
established nanotechnology methods for cell-specific delivery of therapeutic and diagnostic payloads (small
molecules and biologics) 2. Establish a Resource Development Core focused on nascent technologies in
diverse areas of physical sciences to catalyse kidney research. 3. Establish an Administrative Core to oversee
all operations of the Center and ensure new technologies are made readily available to the kidney research
community and 4. Provide an immersive summer SciHigh research program for high school students.
A dedicated, energetic and talented transdisciplinary scientific and administrative team at Northwestern and the
University of Southern California will ensure NU-NRC fulfills its mission to transform kidney research through
physical science solutions and move us closer to realizing its bold vision: physical science solutions to cure
kidney diseases."
10914908,"PROJECT SUMMARY – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The mission of the Administrative Core of the proposed O'Brien Northwestern University National Resource
Center that will serve as the first Physical Sciences-Kidney Resource Center is two-fold: first, to create the
infrastructure, processes and procedures that are required to guide the Center in accord with the Center
framework; and second, to connect the Center with the broader NIDDK National Resource Network. The major
goals of the Center's Administrative Core are to (1) Support transdisciplinary physical sciences in kidney
research, training, and outreach; (2) Foster synergy and integration of the Center; (3) Support planning and
evaluation activities; and (4) Expand participation and diversity of investigators in kidney research. The Center
has adopted a multi-PI/PD leadership model for the Administrative, Biomedical, and Resource Development
Cores, with leadership teams consisting of physical scientists and kidney researchers to provide top-down
integration of physical sciences approaches and kidney research. The proposed administrative team of Drs.
Quaggin (Principal Investigator/Director), Alfred George (Co-PI/PD/Co-Director), and Sheila Judge (Associate
Director) brings extensive experience in developing effective strategies for management and training activities.
The Administrative Core of the Northwestern University National Resource Center (NU-NRC) will fulfill its
mission “to enable transformative kidney research through the application of physical sciences” with the following
six Specific Aims: 1. Lead, manage, and integrate all aspects of the NU-NRC and ensure that Center resources
are shared nationally. 2. Collaborate with the National Coordinating Center (NCC) and other NRCs to: (a)
Prioritize external requests to maximize access to network resources; (b) Enhance national outreach and impact;
and (c) Educate the community about kidney research. 3. Monitor emerging scientific technologies, methods,
models, and concepts and facilitate their application to the needs of the national kidney research community. 4.
Contribute to the expansion of the pool of kidney investigators. 5. Enhance the diversity of the Center and kidney
research at Northwestern. 6. Develop and implement a Summer Student Enrichment program.
The NU-NRC offers a robust infrastructure for providing established nanotechnology-based translational
capabilities for drug delivery to kidney researchers through its Biomedical Resource Core and strong oversight
mechanisms to foster new applications of physical science-based technologies through its Developmental
Resource Core. In addition, the Center will leverage a well-established SciHigh program, a wide array of training
opportunities, and pilot funding to expand and diversify the pool of talented kidney researchers and lower the
barriers to research for early stage investigators. A well-defined set of Center metrics, milestones and timeline
will aid ongoing evaluation of NU-NRC progress. Finally, NU-NRC leadership are poised to support the work of
the O'Brien Kidney Consortium and maximize the value of resource centers across the consortium."
10914910,"SUMMARY - RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT CORE
The Resource Development Core (RDC) is a major component of the proposed Northwestern University
National Resource Center (NU-NRC), whose mission is to enable transformative kidney research through
the application of physical sciences methods and approaches. The goal(s) of the RDC is to develop new
and improved research resources that will be shared by the Biomedical Resource Core.
Advances in single cell technologies have revealed the diversity of cell types that lie within the millions
of nephrons residing within the adult human kidneys and their complex spatial and functional relationships.
While this complexity has historically posed challenges in the development and delivery of therapies for
kidney diseases, recent advances in physical science platforms and engineering technologies that
consider tissue architecture, function and composition in their design provide powerful—yet severely
underutilized—solutions to advance kidney research. The Resource Development Core will function as an
incubator to advance emerging physical sciences technologies and validate their applicability, quality and
impact as solutions for key challenges in kidney research. The RDC not only leverages Northwestern's
powerhouse of physical scientists in nanomedicine, bioengineering and chemistry with demonstrated
commitment to kidney research, it also brings a robust interdisciplinary approach and strong physical science
presence into the kidney community. The goals of the RDC will be realized through the following 4 specific
aims: 1. Establish an innovative and dynamic incubator focused initially on three pilot projects that will:
advance nanomedicine approaches to deliver short RNAs to the kidney, develop microfluidic-based high
throughput genome screens to identify therapeutic targets in the kidney and further develop platforms to allow
spatial proteoform mapping of the kidney; 2. Establish a quarterly Incubator Think Tank to spur innovation
and provide a forum to promote collaborations between physical scientists and kidney researchers to
launch new pilot projects; 3. Foster robust validation of all new and improved resources; and 4. Collaborate with
the consortium to prioritize resource availability and impact."
10914912,"SUMMARY-BIOMEDICAL RESOURCE CORE
A major unmet challenge in kidney research is the inability of most traditional approaches and methods to
harness the complexity of tissue function, structure, and cellular phenotypes. Innovations in nanotechnology
provide powerful tools, reagents, and platforms that outperform traditional approaches in several areas of
medicine, as clearly shown by stunning successes including mRNA vaccine development and oncology.
Nevertheless, these resources are largely untapped by the kidney community and are unavailable in individual
labs or institutions. Northwestern University (NU) is home to global leaders and pioneers in nanotechnology
housed in the International Institute of Nanomedicine (IIN). During the tenure of the Northwestern O'Brien Kidney
Center (NU-GoKIDNEY), we leveraged this unique scientific expertise at NU to establish and optimize services
that deploy the power of nanotechnology in the service of kidney researchers in their efforts to develop more
effective treatments for kidney diseases. The proposed Core builds on the momentum established through the
Core B nanotherapeutic services offered by NU-GoKIDNEY, which includes 1) longstanding commitment to
kidney research of nanomedicine leaders at NU who served as Core leaders and members of our Executive
committee, 2) demonstrated interest in nanotechnology services by kidney investigators who requested
nanotechnology services and submitted P&F proposals focused on nanomedicine solutions. These established
services now form the basis of the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 will establish a Biomedical Resource Core
to implement a service design for precision targeting of desired payloads to specific cells and sub-regions within
the kidney; Aim 2 will establish SOPs and implement internal QA/QC and SOP protocols for all services offered;
Aim 3 will ensure national access to resources by multiple mechanisms, that operate in collaboration with the
consortium. In summary, the NU- Biomedical Resource Core will harness the power of nanotechnology to
advance kidney health and provide an easily accessed portal to Core services for investigators throughout the
US."
10905975,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application addresses targeted health issues through a Cooperative Research Agreement with the World
Trade Center (WTC) Health Program (UO1). The presence of carcinogens and inducers of inflammation in WTC
dust have raised the possibility that those exposed to WTC dust during the 9/11 attacks could have increased
cancer incidence. To date, several cohort studies indicate that total cancer rates are 6-14% above background
rates with significantly greater increases for thyroid and prostate cancer (Moir, 2016; Solan, 2013; Li, 2012;
Jordan, 2011; Zeig-Owens, 2011).
Increased exposure based on the time of arrival for workers, their proximity to early response to the WTC and
duration of exposure have been associated with increased risk of tumor progression (de la Hoz, 2008; Lioy and
Georgopoulos, 2006). Recent studies in small animal models indicate that WTC dust particles or metals are
undetectable or present at exceedingly low levels in prostate tissues compared to lung following WTC dust
exposure by inhalation or gavage (Wang, 2022; Gong, 2019), and long-term studies of rodents have not revealed
evidence of a direct carcinogenic mechanism. Instead, there is evidence from both human RNA expression and
DNA methylation analyses (Yu, 2022) and animal models (Wang, 2022; Gong, 2019) that inflammation induced
by this dust may be implicated in promoting prostate cancer. In the mouse, WTC dust exposure promotes
systemic as well as localized prostate inflammation, increased growth in PTEN deficient prostate epithelia and
promotion of genetically initiated prostate tumors (Wang, 2022).
Aim 1 will investigate whether WTC associated prostate cancer is more likely to recur independent of tumor
grade at diagnosis and if there are molecular signatures of aggressiveness at diagnosis in those who recur. We
will utilize increased biochemical (PSA) recurrence to define responders with adverse clinical response to WTC
dust following surgery or radiation therapy. We will also apply recently identified signatures by RNA expression
analysis and mass spec multiplex immunostaining of primary prostate cancer tissues to test whether these
immune/inflammatory markers correlate with increased tumor recurrence in WTC responders.
Aim 2 will focus on correlating our human findings with those in mouse genetically engineered mouse models
bearing targeted lesions to prostate that model human PC. These experiments take advantage of our strong
preliminary evidence that these models support a role of WTC dust exposure in PC progression. Experiments
will include testing whether WTC dust exposure promotes recurrence of genetically initiated PCs following
androgen deprivation therapy and/or experimental PC metastasis. We will also compare, and contrast WTC dust
associated immune/inflammatory biomarkers in the mouse with those identified in human PCs.
Our overarching goal is to translate understanding gained toward improved surveillance of WTC responders
most at risk for prostate cancer."
10760310,"Since the benefits of mammography screening are uncertain for women >75 years and there are important
harms, guidelines recommend that primary care providers (PCPs) engage women >75 years in shared
decision making (SDM). The challenge is in weighing the trade-off between potentially finding a breast cancer
early which may in turn help an older woman live longer and/or better, or instead result in her being harmed by
work-up and/or treatment of a breast cancer that never otherwise would have caused problems in her lifetime
(overdiagnosis). Ideally, screening decisions should consider an older woman's breast cancer risk, health, and
preferences. However, 56% of women >75 years are routinely screened, including many with short life
expectancy, and few are informed of the harms. In prior work we found that older women want to talk about
these decisions with their PCPs. However, PCPs feel ill-prepared and unsupported to engage older women in
SDM and request an easy to use and flexible web-based tool (i.e., a conversation aid) that could provide
personalized information on the benefits and harms of mammography screening based on each patient's own
breast cancer risk and health. Conversation aids (CAs) are increasingly used and are designed to be brief,
require minimal training, fit into clinical work flow, and facilitate SDM. They have been shown to improve SDM
and to increase satisfaction; however, despite the need, no CA exists to support SDM around mammography
screening between PCPs and older women. Therefore, we, an interdisciplinary team of PCPs, experts in SDM
and implementation science, modeling researchers from the NCI-funded Cancer Intervention and Surveillance
Network (CISNET), and other expert stakeholders, aim to develop and test an interactive web-based
conversation aid (CA) on mammography screening for PCPs to use with women >75 years, and involved
family members during a visit. In Aim 1, we will leverage two CISNET models to estimate the personalized
benefits and harms of mammography screening in women >75 years based on age, race, comorbidity, and
breast cancer risk, necessary for decision-making. Model generated outcomes will be used to populate the CA
which we will develop and revise in Aim 2 using an established iterative end-user centered approach that
includes observing use of the CA by 10 PCPs practicing in diverse settings during 30 clinical encounters. Once
we have developed a CA that supports SDM, we will pilot test the CA in a pretest-posttest trial including 40
PCPs from Boston-area community, academic, and safety-net practices, 100 women >75 years and 25 of their
family members, and 10 medical assistants. The goal of the pilot study is to show that the CA is feasible to use
during primary care visits in diverse settings and to obtain pilot data on the CA's effects to inform
implementation and a future pragmatic trial. We hypothesize that our novel CA will increase PCP self-efficacy
to engage older women in SDM and as a result older, women will make more informed, value-concordant
screening decisions thereby maximizing the benefits of screening while minimizing its harms."
10760311,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The majority of older Americans live with chronic health conditions, and pain is the most common physical
symptom experienced across conditions. Spouses of older adults with chronic pain are caregivers in a broad
sense, and often provide assistance with daily activities; however, ongoing exposure to patients’ suffering is
likely to take a toll on the health and well-being of these caregivers. Moreover, our recent research suggests
that older spouses in a close marital relationship are more affected by their partner’s pain than spouses in a
less close relationship. This intriguing finding suggests that closeness may be good for the relationship but bad
for spouses when patients are in more pain. The proposed project will test for these divergent effects and their
longer-term implications in a sample of 144 older adults with chronic low back pain (CLBP), due to the high
prevalence and treatment-related costs of this condition in the Medicare population. Patients and caregivers
will report on their daily experiences twice per day for 30 days using tablet computers. They will also complete
in-person interviews and physical function assessments every 6 months over 2 years. Aim 1 is to examine
prospective effects of patients’ daily pain experience (severity, interference, catastrophizing) on spousal
caregivers’ distress (i.e., reactivity) and controlling responses, and divergent effects of daily closeness. We
predict that patients’ pain experience will have stronger associations with spouses’ subsequent distress, and
spouses will respond with more solicitousness and pressure, on days of high closeness than on low closeness
days. In addition, we predict greater daily closeness will be associated with more marital satisfaction that day,
for both partners. Bi-directional and cross-day effects also will be examined in tests of these hypotheses. Aim 2
will use multilevel latent growth curve modeling to link daily caregiver emotional reactivity and controlling
responses with longer-term outcomes for both partners. Our prediction is that spouses who are more
distressed by patients’ pain will have more depressive symptoms over 2 years compared to those who are less
distressed. In addition, we expect that patients whose spouse is more controlling in response to patients’ pain
will have worse physical function, greater disability, and increased health care utilization over 2 years
compared to those whose spouse is less controlling. Significance of this study lies in: 1) improved
understanding of the impact of late-life pain on spousal caregivers’ well-being; 2) identification of longer-term
consequences of dynamic, dyadic experiences for both patients and caregivers; and 3) findings that will be
used to create a couple-oriented intervention for CLBP in future research. Areas of innovation include a novel
conceptualization of relationship closeness that will reveal its advantages and disadvantages for couples living
with chronic pain, a focus on older couples, and a study design that will enable strong conclusions regarding
temporal sequence of daily experiences and their longer-term consequences."

With the increased use of mobile health (mHealth) apps to improve health outcomes, protecting
private health data is becoming increasingly important. These mHealth apps are offered by
healthcare providers and used by patients for various reasons such as paying bills, scheduling
appointments, sending messages to providers, accessing lab results, and viewing prescriptions
and medical records. With patients’ increasing desire for data accessibility and app data sharing,
it is critical to ensure that patients transmit their Protected Health Information (PHI) to apps that
comply with HIPAA privacy and security regulations. Unfortunately, about 25% of healthcare
providers suffer from data breaches violating HIPAA policies caused by using mobile devices that
come with mHealth apps. These breaches result in lawsuits and loss of confidence among health
providers and patients. Earlier research has focused on mobile device security but has not
checked further how apps store or transfer data securely before being used by remote healthcare
providers or users. A total of 303,867 complaints have been received in the HHS.gov until July
2022 [95], which indicates that most developers, including mHealth apps developers, are unaware
of HIPAA security and privacy regulations. This creates the market opportunity to develop static
and dynamic code analysis tools for mHealth app developers, so their developed products meet
HIPAA security and privacy guidelines. Currently, there is a lack of an analysis framework to
check mHealth apps’ security and privacy risks following the applicable HIPAA technical security
and privacy guidelines. We have developed a framework to analyze mHealth apps for HIPAA
security and privacy compliance for Android. The tool is available both as a web-based interface
for users without knowledge of HIPAA or app security and as a plugin with Android Studio to
enable health app developers to test source code for potential data security breaches related to
HIPAA before posting to the marketplace. In addition, the tool addresses API level checking for
secure data communication mandated by recent Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
(CMS) guidelines between third-party mobile health apps and EHR systems. The analysis
framework also addresses heterogeneous health data and enables providers to comply with
HIPAA administrative and operational guidelines. We have performed two acceptance tests on
the prototype based on partnering with HIPAA experts, medical doctors, and for-profit EHR
vendors along with the effectiveness of tools for detecting health data security breaches. In Phase
II, we propose a commercial product mSPAiOS as a mHealth HIPAA checker by extending the
framework for iOS mHealth apps security and privacy assessment, plugin support for xCode
environment, and performance evaluation of the product by at least 3 for-profit organizations/EHR
vendors. The proposed tool has the potential to capture the market of the HIPAA-compliant
assessment as a unique product that is not provided by any existing tools."

Over 20 million people living with HIV (PLHIV) are receiving antiretroviral therapy and require HIV viral load
testing to identify cases of virological failure and provide actionable information to guide alternative clinical
treatment. Current methods for HIV viral load measurement rely on quantitative PCR (qPCR) or digital PCR
(dPCR), which are commonly restricted to highly resourced central laboratories and there is a need to
decentralize HIV viral load monitoring to enable rapid, clinic-based or home self-testing viral load measurements.
We have identified a novel method for implementing digital isothermal amplification that leverages the
characteristic viscous reaction buffer of recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) isothermal amplification
chemistry and commercially available porous membranes. We propose to apply amplification nucleation site
analysis (ANSA) for HIV-1 viral load monitoring to accurately quantify HIV-1 RNA over clinically relevant HIV-1
subtypes and viral loads. We propose two exploratory aims to demonstrate that ANSA can achieve the required
viral load dynamic range and quantitative precision across HIV-1 subtypes."
10765686,"With an ever-aging population and an estimated prevalence of Alzheimer disease of 5.7 million people
in the United States alone, the impetus for more targeted treatments for age-related cognitive disorders is greater
now than ever. Neuroplasticity, the ability of neural networks to adapt and remodel given experience, dwindles
with age, providing possible mechanistic insights into this decline. An important layer of neuroplasticity, unique
to a couple of discrete areas of the adult mammalian brain, is the addition of newly-generated neurons into
existing circuits, a process known as neurogenesis. While the existence and importance of adult hippocampal
neurogenesis in young adults has been well-established, we know very little about hippocampal neurogenesis
in aging brains. Importantly, hippocampal neurogenesis continues into old age although there is a substantial
decline in the number of newborn neurons. For example, in 26-month-old rodents, ~1000 proliferating cells could
be detected per day, although only half that detected in 5-month-old adult rats. A recent study demonstrated that
thousands of new neurons could be detected in the aged adult human dentate gyrus, and further, that in patients
with Alzheimer disease, newborn neurons were fewer in number and exhibited delayed maturation. As a starting
point, we ask why neurogenesis declines in the aging brain. Based on our preliminary studies, we found that
biased circuit activity may regulate hippocampal neurogenesis in the aging brain. During screening of potential
molecules biasing circuit activity, we found that one sphingolipid signaling is active in interneurons and becomes
less active in the aging brain. We propose to genetically intervene this signaling to study its role in regulating
neurogenesis in the aging brain. Lastly, we determine how biased circuit activity regulates hippocampal
neurogenesis. Our results will not only provide mechanistic insights into the understanding of neurogenesis in
the aging brain it also provides a possible strategy to intervene aging circuit activity to regulate neurogenesis."
10765687,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiome that affects ~29% of reproductive age women
and is linked with higher risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes, postsurgical infections, and sexually transmitted
infections. While lactobacilli typically dominate the healthy vagina, BV is characterized by low lactobacilli levels
and an overgrowth of diverse anaerobic bacteria, most often including Gardnerella and Prevotella. Current oral
or topical antibiotic treatments alleviate symptoms in 80% of women, at least temporarily. However, most women
will experience a recurrence of BV within one-year post-treatment. A recent clinical study showed that a vaginal
probiotic treatment regimen (with Lactobacillus crispatus), used following a vaginal course of antibiotics
(metronidazole), significantly improved long-term treatment efficacy. Unfortunately, current topically-applied
formulations require repeated administrations (once to twice daily), which can hinder female convenience and
adherence to treatment, particularly when undergoing multiple weeks of treatment (required to administer both
antibiotic and probiotics).
In this project we will use 3D printing and computational modeling, iteratively enabled by functional investigation
of prototype scaffolds in vitro and in vivo, to design long-acting products that sustain therapeutic delivery, while
enabling phased-delivery of antibiotics and probiotics to the female reproductive tract. Our team brings together
female reproductive tract-specific expertise in delivery vehicle design, computational modeling, and preclinical
BV models. The ultimate goal is to use 3D-bioprinting to incorporate different device compartments, which
sequentially release antibiotics that target anaerobic overgrowth, followed by live probiotics that restore balance
back in favor of vaginal lactobacilli. In Aim 1, we will design and characterize 3D-printed silicone scaffolds that
sustain antibiotic-only delivery. Aim 2 will design and evaluate 3D-printed silicone and gelatin alginate
composites that sequentially release antibiotics followed by probiotics, providing a “1-2 punch” strategy to kill BV
bacteria and provide a ‘healthy’ Lactobacillus alternative. Each aim will focus first on a materials-based
characterization of Met-containing silicone (1A) or Met-silicone probiotic-gelatin alginate composites (2A).
Measurements from in vitro release experiments will be used to develop and test computational models that
predict the delivery of antibiotic (1B) or dual agents (2B) in a “virtual female reproductive tract” and ultimately in
a mouse co-infection model. We will evaluate Met-silicone (1C) and Met-silicone probiotic-gelatin alginate
composites (2C) for cytotoxicity to the vaginal epithelium and ability to stimulate soluble proinflammatory
mediators and downstream histopathology. In our mouse model, we will measure levels of viable Gardnerella
and Prevotella recovered from vaginal and uterine tissues following treatment with blank or active agent-
containing 3D-printed scaffolds. If successful, this project will support the development of multipurpose platforms
to prevent and treat BV as well as other female reproductive tract applications."

The voltage gated proton channel (HV1) exists in many human tissues and plays numerous roles vital
to human health. For example, it contributes to bacterial killing by white blood cells, sperm
maturation and mobility, histamine release by basophils, B lymphocyte signaling, and airway fluid
regulation. Abnormal HV1 function has been implicated in breast cancer metastasis, brain damage in
ischemic stroke, and exacerbation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. As its gene was not reported
until 2006, HV1 is a newcomer to the voltage gated ion channel family. Its structure is unique in
resembling a crucial component of all voltage-gated ion channels, namely the voltage-sensing
domain that detects membrane potential and transduces this into channel opening or closing. Its
newcomer status, unique structure, and essential roles in human health and disease make
understanding HV1 function and dysfunction highly significant.
 The DeCoursey lab has been deeply involved in the study of HV1, from discovering its existence in
mammalian and human cells, to identifying its role in a number of human cells and tissues, to finally
dissecting the molecule itself to identify which parts perform the major functions. Over the next five
years we intend to expand our knowledge of this important molecule at multiple levels, building on our
recent progress. Structure-function knowledge is crucial both for understanding mechanisms and for
drug design. Much has been learned about structure-function relationships from mutations to the
human channel. We believe that it will be more productive in the future to explore structure-function
relationships in the highly variable naturally-occurring HV1 in diverse species. An exciting new
direction will be studying the involvement of cholesterol and membrane lipid “rafts” in the
physiological regulation of hHV1 function. Another focus will be to determine the relationship between
hHV1 mutations in B lymphocyte malignancies."

(Significance) Multiple lines of evidence have implicated mGluR5 signaling for the pathophysiology and
treatment of schizophrenia; yet possible dysregulation of mGluR5 signaling and their pathophysiologic roles
are presently unknown. Recently, we found direct evidence for reduced mGluR5 signaling in the postmortem
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of patients with schizophrenia. mGluR5 is physically connected with
NMDA receptor (GluN) complexes in the postsynaptic density (PSD) and these two pathways facilitate the
activity of each other. (Preliminary Studies) We examined the agonist-induced activation of mGluR5 signaling
in the postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) derived from 17 matched pairs of patients and
controls. We found a striking reduction in three pathways downstream to mGluR5 receptor activation; namely,
Gq/11 activation and recruitment of PI3K and scaffolding proteins compared to controls (P<0.01). This
dysregulation was accompanied by alterations in phosphorylation of mGluR5, important for receptor
desensitization, and in mGluR5 association with RGS4, Preso 1, norbin and tamalin, which are critical for
surface expression and clustering. Importantly, we find evidence supporting disruption of reciprocal facilitation
between mGluR5 and GluN signaling in schizophrenia and thus hypofunction of one can further compromise
the other. (Scientific Premise) Schizophrenia is associated with mGluR5 signaling hypoactivity mediated by
altered mGluR5 phosphorylation and protein – protein interactions (PrPrIs) in the receptor complexes. mGluR5
hypofunction can contribute to GluN signaling hypoactivity and vice versa via disruption of reciprocal
facilitation. PrPrIs in the interactome may be a point of convergence for etiologic factors. (Specific Aims) To
further characterize mGluR5 hypoactivity and its interplay with GluN signaling in schizophrenia, we will
examine molecular underpinnings for mGluR5 hypoactivity on GluN signaling and vice versa in the DLPFC of
patients compared to controls. (Aim 1). Our preliminary data and recent studies point to PrPrIs as substrates
upon which various molecular alterations converge and precipitate glutamatergic dysregulation. Combining
discovery and quantitative proteomics, we will analyze PrPrI alterations in the mGluR5-GluN interactome in
patients at the basal level and in response to receptor activation (Aim 2). PrPrI alterations in the interactome
can be traced to their etiologic underpinnings at the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic levels. Cutting
edge systems biology algorithms permit us to leverage largest genomics data sets presently available and
impute DLPFC transcriptomics data of the same number of subjects. Genetic variants, imputed transcriptomic
results, along with quantitative PSD proteomics results will be projected onto the interactome using heat
diffusion based algorithms (Aim 3). This will identify etiologically significant and potentially targetable
subnetworks in the interactome. (Impact) We will establish mGluR5 hypofunction as integral to glutamatergic
dysregulation in schizophrenia and identify etiologic underpinnings and potential points of intervention."
10766784,"ABSTRACT
The development of tissue-specific autoimmunity is a chronic process in which finely programmed autoimmune
responses progress and culminate in the target organ. Although the tissue environment is eventually dominated
by the invasive responses, regulatory elements that function to oppose such pathogenic activities remain
understudied. In type 1 diabetes (T1D), the insulin-producing β cells are targeted by self-reactive T cells
infiltrating into the pancreatic islets. Less appreciated is that before the entry of the first T cells, the islet
environment has established an intrinsic mechanism that restrains the onward autoimmune attack. Such
regulation is mediated by a specific subset of the islet resident macrophages specialized in the clearance of
apoptotic β cells, a process referred to as efferocytosis. The efferocytosis program induces anti-inflammatory
responses and when enhanced, imposes strong immunoinhibitory functions, leading to profound protection from
autoimmune diabetes. We hypothesize that the efferocytosis program may act as an original control mechanism
installed in the normal islet environment regardless of autoimmune propensity. This innate mechanism is
common in mice and humans and may considerably differ from other immunomodulatory elements (i.e.,
regulatory T cells (Tregs)), which are introduced along with the adaptive immune invasion. Therefore, examining
efferocytosis in islets will provide conceptual advances to the biological and autoimmune events taking place in
this important organ. Moreover, by analyzing the immunoinhibitory components associated with macrophage
efferocytosis, this project will provide translational and therapeutical insights relevant to human T1D. In this
proposal, we seek to thoroughly examine the efferocytic islet macrophages and define their role in regulating a
complex autoimmune process."
10767874,"The burden of perinatal morbidity and mortality related to preterm birth (PTB) is astounding. Studies show that
environmental exposures contribute to an increased susceptibility to PTB. Identification of the causative
etiology of PTB is essential to improving global maternal and child health. Our preliminary data reveal that
exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is associated with PTB. We have reported that proximity
to Superfund sites in Harris County is associated with very low birth weight, and our studies reveal higher
levels of PAHs in placentas from PTBs compared to term births specifically in women residing near Superfund
sites. In this proposal we will delve into the molecular underpinnings behind PTB and the specific
environmental exposures of PAHs through use of our established transcriptomic and epigenomic pipelines. We
will leverage our readily available serum and placental samples from a population based and PTB enriched
cohort. Furthermore, geostatistical modeling will be utilized to identify clusters of PTB throughout Harris
County. Our central hypothesis underlying our research is that PAH exposures are associated with an
increased rate of PTB, that transcriptomics and epigenomics will yield readily translatable mechanistic
information on this association, and geostatistical modeling will reveal increased clusters of PTB in proximity to
Superfund sites in Harris County."
10767879,"Project Summary
There is a pressing need for technological innovation that leads to more efficient and more sustainable
remediation of contaminated sediments at Superfund sites. This project will develop a sustainable remediation
technology to rapidly treat sediments and soils contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and
related polyaromatic compounds (PACs), including activated PAHs byproducts of environmental
transformations, in a manner that completely removes the associated health risks while adding value to the
impacted media. Our hypothesis is that pyrolysis of contaminated soils/sediments under carefully selected
conditions will reduce the concentration of all organic priority contaminants to below regulatory levels, thus
completely eliminating toxicity, while restoring soil fertility to facilitate ecosystem restoration and re-greening
efforts. Furthermore, different treatment objectives (e.g., regulatory compliance, detoxification, and soil fertility
restoration) need not be mutually exclusive and could be simultaneously achieved by selecting appropriate
pyrolytic treatment intensity (controlled through pyrolysis temperature and residence time). The Specific Aims
of this project are: 1. Demonstrate that thermal pyrolysis will reliably remove PAHs and PACs present in
Superfund site sediments and eliminate their toxicity. 2. Characterize the reaction mechanisms and end products
to guide safe and cost-efficient application. Specifically, we will use thermogravimetry and evolved gas analyses
to elucidate the physical and chemical processes occurring during pyrolysis. The possible catalytic effects of soil
components like clays will be systematically studied, and surface analysis techniques will be used to determine
the chemical composition and spatial distribution of pyrolysis products (like carbonaceous compounds).
Finally, we will carefully characterize the treated soils to determine how their key properties (like surface
chemistry, chemical stability, porosity, density, water-holding capacity, and ability to hold plant-available
water) are affected by the chosen pyrolysis conditions (contact time, temperature, %O2, moisture, etc.) to
inform reaction mechanisms and guide reactor optimization efforts. 3. Identify the operating conditions that
maximize the benefits of soil pyrolysis (PAH & PAC removal and improved soil fertility) while minimizing associated
costs. Thus, the proposed studies will build on our recent discovery that pyrolysis can add value to soil
contaminated with petrochemical wastes (including heavy petroleum hydrocarbons) by converting these
pollutants to char-like material. The expected benefits are significant. We anticipate that pyrolysis will: (a) rapidly
and reliably decrease PAH and PAC concentrations below regulatory thresholds; (b) add agricultural value
to the treated soils by improving fertility and drainage; and (c) contribute to a positive public image, facilitating
regulatory acceptance from stakeholders such as the EPA of this novel technology."
10767882,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Administrative Core 
The Iowa Superfund Research Program (ISRP) is a highly integrated research center focusing on the sources, 
exposures, toxicities, and remediation of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) congeners in air. The center’s 
integration across biomedical and environmental science and engineering disciplines requires organizational 
infrastructure to enable the frequent, regular exchange of ideas, experiments, and data among projects and 
cores. The Admin’s Core’s major goal is to maintain a structure that promotes research integration, enables 
timely communication, and supports research translation that raises the quality and impact of center activities. 
The Admin Core provides vision and direction to ensure continued success in research and stakeholder 
engagement. To meet this goal, the Admin Core has three aims: 1) Provide program leadership and 
infrastructure to ensure synthesis of findings and integration of activities. Director Hornbuckle and Deputy 
Director Lehmler are leading environmental health researchers with backgrounds in environmental engineering 
and biomedical science, respectively. The ISRP Executive Committee, composed of leaders from every 
program component and representing diverse disciplines, works with Hornbuckle and Lehmler to ensure full 
integration and coordination among projects and cores. The leadership actively promotes frequent and regular 
researcher interactions both inside and outside the ISRP through monthly meetings, seminars, and events. 
The Admin Core conducts annual assessments of productivity and effectiveness for each project and core to 
guide recommendations from the External Advisory Committee (EAC), which is composed of nationally 
recognized Superfund researchers and other stakeholders. 2) Provide administrative and fiscal services, 
support, and oversight to ensure robust stewardship of available resources. The Director, together with the 
Center Administrator and Fiscal Manager, provide programmatic and financial services, support, and oversight. 
The ISRP is housed under and supported by IIHR—Hydroscience & Engineering, which has extensive 
experience managing multidisciplinary, multi-institutional projects ranging from thousands to tens of millions of 
dollars. 3) Disseminate ISRP scientific and environmental health discoveries through effective research 
translation. The ISRP is dedicated to making center research available and accessible in consideration of the 
SRP research translation objectives: a) communication with SRP and SRP staff; b) partnerships with 
government agencies; c) technology transfer; and d) information dissemination to other end-users, with a 
particular focus on communicating in the manner most appropriate for each audience. If the ISRP is renewed, 
regular activities will include the biennial International PCB Workshop; social media news feeds; webinars and 
training workshops; decision-support tools for agencies and organizations managing PCBs in schools; web 
applications to disseminate research findings; and development of new technology and platforms to maximize 
bi-directional communication."
10767885,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Data Management and Analysis Core 
The Iowa Superfund Research Program (ISRP) tackles a highly complex issue that requires a well-integrated 
thematic approach. The Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) will provide the expertise, tools, and 
workflow optimization to support and maximize ISRP research results and impact. The DMAC and project 
leaders will develop tailored Priority Analysis Plans with rigorous Quality Assurance to assure accuracy, 
precision, representativeness, comparability, and reproducibility using appropriate statistical and analytical 
methods. As a result, ISRP projects will make high-impact discoveries, publish in high-quality journals, and 
provide timely scientific guidance to stakeholders regarding PCBs in the environment and their effect on 
human health. DMAC will have five Specific Aims: 1) develop, maintain, and automate data management, 
data-sharing, and quality assurance infrastructure for full reproducibility, transparency, and rigor in all ISRP 
studies; 2) support ISRP projects and cores with embedded expert biostatical contributions, services, and 
guidance; 3) develop novel statistical methods and associated software for data analytic challenges that impact 
all ISRP projects, cores, and affiliated sciences; 4) support the Research Experience and Training 
Coordination Core by providing guidance, resources, events, and instruction on data science and informatics to 
trainees and investigators; and 5) provide the data management and analytical foundations for research 
integration across the ISRP. Activities proposed under DMAC Specific Aim 3 address SRP mandates 2 and 3, 
which call for novel statistical methods and tools to support detection and risk assessment. Activities under 
Specific Aim 5 address SRP mandates 1, 2, and 4 by integrating data and methods from across the ISRP into 
cost-effective solutions and strategies to comprehensively assess and reduce population-scale PCB risks to 
human health. Through DMAC, the ISRP is charting new territory at the University of Iowa (UI). This work 
represents a unique opportunity to align existing resources to support interdisciplinary research. With the help 
of our UI partners, the DMAC will be an early adopter of proven enabling approaches and technologies for data 
management, data-sharing, reproducible research workflows, and informatics investigation and training. DMAC 
will lead the application of biostatistics and informatics to support and optimize ISRP research. We will provide 
expert staff, platforms, policies, and research support for all ISRP projects and cores throughout the research 
process, including training and methods to maximize research outcomes, applied solutions, replicable 
products, and sound evidence-based decision support. DMAC’s activities will enhance full ISRP integration 
and catalyze effective development, refinement, application, and sharing of innovative solutions generated by 
ISRP interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary PCB research. DMAC’s centralized services, platforms, and 
policies, along with innovative new methods, will yield economies of scale in effort and cost for data 
management, processing, sharing, analysis, and training."
10767886,"SUMMARY: Community Engagement Core 
The Community Engagement Core (CEC) facilitates bidirectional interactions between community stakeholders 
and the ISRP researchers who study polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a class of Superfund chemicals. These 
bidirectional interactions are critical to ISRP’s long-term goal of improving the health and well-being of 
populations by preventing or limiting exposure to PCBs through scientifically-informed interventions. ISRP 
studies demonstrate that inhalation of indoor air, especially in schools in the United States contaminated with 
airborne PCBs, represents a significant and current public health concern for school-aged children. The CEC is an 
important integrating core for the ISRP because it develops partnerships with communities impacted by PCBs, 
serves as a source of information and educational resources for these communities, and acts as a liaison 
between partner communities and researchers. The CEC is fully integrated with ISRP research projects and 
other cores and has existing or developing relationships with the partner communities. Columbus Junction, 
Iowa, and East Chicago, Ind., have been active participants in the ISRP AESOP (Project 3) prospective human 
cohort study since 2006, during which time the CEC has facilitated a variety of school- and community-based 
engagements. West Liberty, Iowa, is proposed as a new AESOP cohort community and will also be the 
location of several proposed Project 4 activities focused on source characterization and remediation of 
airborne PCBs in schools and homes (these activities are ongoing in Columbus Junction and East Chicago). 
More than 100,000 people live within 5 km of the New Bedford Harbor Superfund site, where the current ISRP 
Project 4 found large emissions of gas-phase PCBs. Building on this important discovery, Project 5 will 
research how to reduce PCB emissions from New Bedford Harbor, and the CEC will facilitate bidirectional 
interactions focused on “report-back” engagements designed to harvest community input and share relevant 
ISRP research findings. Our community partners in Columbus Junction and West Liberty have already 
brainstormed various health campaign designs and have agreed to assemble and maintain community 
advisory boards to inform and oversee jointly-pursued activities."

the Institute for Drug and Alcohol Studies (IDAS) at Virginia Commonwealth University has established the
expertise and resources to execute early clinical trials of potential pharmacotherapies for substance use
disorders including opioid and cocaine use disorders as well as comorbid opioid+cocaine use disorder. Under
that funding, medication development studies were carried out using preclinical models, phase I inpatient
studies, brain imaging studies, and behavioral laboratory phenotyping studies for novel compounds for opioid
and cocaine use disorders. One of the novel compounds we have examined for opioid, cocaine, and comorbid
opioid+cocaine use disorders is the 5-HT2CR agonist lorcaserin. This research was based on our preclinical
data that lorcaserin significantly reduces opioid self-administration and opioid and cocaine cue elicited
responding in rodents8. In response to RFA-DA-19-018, we propose to maintain and enhance the
established medication development infrastructure at IDAS to support Phase I and Phase 2 clinical
trials in collaboration with the Division of Therapeutics and Medical Consequences at NIDA. As a
demonstration project of the ability of IDAS to conduct early phase clinical trials, we propose to assess safety,
target engagement, and preliminary measures of efficacy, for lorcaserin in combination with buprenorphine for
opioid use disorder.
Specific Aims for Demonstration Project:
 Experiment 1 (0-18 months).
Aim 1: Examine side effects and drug interactions between lorcaserin and buprenorphine-naloxone in
participants with opioid use disorder who are in MAT with buprenorphine-naloxone.
Aim 2: Examine effects of lorcaserin on subjective measures of drug craving compared to placebo in
participants with opioid use disorder who are in MAT with buprenorphine-naloxone.
 Experiment 2 (Post Experiment I if approved by NIDA).
Aim 1: Examine effect of lorcaserin on opioid cue related brain directional (effective) connectivity compared to
placebo in participants with opioid use disorder who are in MAT with buprenorphine-naloxone.
Aim 2: Examine effect of lorcaserin on impulsivity related effective connectivity compared to placebo in
participants with opioid use disorder who are in MAT with buprenorphine-naloxone.
Exploratory Aim: Examine noninvasively, using MRI spectroscopy, the effects of lorcaserin compared to
placebo on brain GABA concentrations in opioid use disorder participants who are in MAT with buprenorphine-
naloxone."
10767779,"The proposed GCE4All Biomedical Technology Development and Dissemination Center at Oregon State
University (OSU) will optimize, develop, and broadly disseminate Genetic Code Expansion (GCE) technology –
the engineering of cellular translation to express proteins containing non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs). GCE
provides unprecedented ways to probe and manipulate macromolecular structure and function, analyze protein
malfunctions in disease, engineer bioanalytical tools, and create new precision biotherapeutics. GCE's feasibility
is well-established, but it remains difficult for researchers to access and implement, and thus remains little-used
– an ideal target for BTDD support. During its envisioned lifespan of ≤15 years, the Center's mission will be to
optimize and extend existing GCE technologies to enable facile use by non-specialists, and to broadly disseminate
them via widespread education, effective training, and by providing sustainable access to optimized technologies
via established repositories – enabling powerful GCE approaches to become standard, widely-used tools of
biomedical researchers. Advantageous for creating the proposed Center is our experience and leadership in the
groundbreaking predecessor OSU Unnatural Protein (UP) Facility (2012-21), which at a much smaller level
developed and disseminated GCE methods and trained researchers. GCE4All Center leaders are thus well-
equipped to accomplish the Center mission via its 2 Technology Development Projects (TDPs), 10 initial Driving
Biomedical Projects (DBPs), and Community Engagement (CE). The synergistic TDPs will optimize and extend
GCE methods for 1) bioorthogonal ligation applications using GCE-produced proteins, including low-
background labeling and tracking in mammalian cells, and 2) producing ncAA-proteins that contain biochemical
probes and/or native or analog post-translational modifications (PTMs) – ubiquitous but little-understood
regulators of protein functions. To ensure broad relevance, targeted technology advances will overcome barriers
faced by geographically-diverse, NIH-funded DBPs that will serve as stringent testbeds for the work. To achieve
its “GCE for All”goal, Center optimizations will bridge 4 common technological barriers that deter researchers
from adopting GCE. These 4 GCE Bridges include: effective tools for 1) incorporating ncAAs of choice; for
efficiently producing impurity-free GCE proteins in 2) E. coli and 3) mammalian cells; and 4) creation of stable
mammalian cell lines and reliable protocols for reproducible studies in cells. The CE core will provide diverse
training activities including hands-on workshops already proven effective by our UP Facility. Via the Center
website, CE will disseminate GCE methods, online training, and host a Wiki GCE-knowledgebase and a GCE4All
community networking bulletin board enabling peer-to-peer support in the GCE user community. The CE core
will also organize biennial International GCE Conferences and ensure all optimized reagents are publicly
available from repositories. The GCE4All Center will achieve these ambitious goals in Years 1-5, toward its
ultimate goal of transforming GCE from a boutique method to a standard part of the molecular biologist's toolkit."

The proposed research plan focuses on improving our understanding of the effects of acidosis on pneumonia
and establishing the conceptual basis for diagnostic and therapeutic translation. Acidosis is common in critically
ill pneumonia patients, and is associated with high mortality. The pathophysiology of acidosis in pneumonia is
poorly understood, and current therapies fail to improve major outcomes. Our studies have shown that pulmonary
microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) utilize the carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) isoform to regulate pH,
metabolism and migration. We also demonstrated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection of PMVECs induces
release of cytotoxic amyloid proteins, which disrupts the alveolar capillary membrane. These cytotoxic amyloids
induce soluble CA IX shedding from PMVECs which compromises their repair potential. Based on these
preliminary studies, we test the hypothesis that P. aeruginosa infection induces cytotoxic amyloid production that
leads to shedding of soluble CA IX in PMVECs, increasing lung injury. Specific aims test the hypotheses that: 1)
CA IX is critical to the acid regulation, metabolism and migration of PMVECs and pulmonary endothelial barrier
integrity; and, 2) P. aeruginosa infection elicits cytotoxic amyloid production, causing CA IX shedding in PMVECs,
which increases lung injury. In vitro, we will use genetic approaches and endothelial cell functional assays to
evaluate the effects of acidosis and the role of specific CA IX functional domains during physiologic and infectious
conditions. In vivo and ex vivo, we will use acidosis, pneumonia and isolated lung perfusion mouse models to
translate in vitro findings. Successful completion of this study will provide new insights into the mechanisms
underlying acidosis in pneumonia and help identify CA IX and cytotoxic amyloids as biomarkers and therapeutic
targets for pneumonia."

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the seventh most common cancer worldwide. In the oral
cavity, most cases of squamous cell carcinoma begin as a precursor lesion classified by the World Health
Organization (WHO) as an “oral potentially malignant disorder (OPMD).” Oral leukoplakia is the most common
OPMD, with a global prevalence of 4.1% and a malignant transformation rate between 0.1%-34.0%, and the
malignant transformation rate increases to 40% in oral dysplasia. These wide ranges of malignant
transformation rates suggest an unmet need to develop prognostic biomarkers that can better differentiate
benign from premalignant lesions and predict the risk of transformation of premalignant lesions to invasive
cancer. During the development of cancer, immunoediting occurs within the tumor microenvironment.
Immunoediting consists of three phases: elimination, equilibrium, and escape. We posit that there are defined
immune signatures within a lesional microenvironment that correlate with the transformation of precancerous
cells to invasive cancer based on the known phases of immunoediting. The current standard of care tools to
establish benign from premalignant oral lesions include conventional hematoxylin/eosin (HE) and single
staining immunohistochemistry (IHC), which limits the number of immune cells which can be evaluated at any
one time. Thus, we developed an innovative spatial omics technology (SAFE) that facilitates the
comprehensive and deep multiplexing of whole tissue sections and incorporates artificial intelligence and
machine learning approaches to accelerate the analysis of ~45 molecular and immune signatures within oral
lesions in a clinically appropriate timeframe. We propose to perform single-cell RNA sequencing to identify the
unique cellular and immunological transcriptional programs that distinguish benign and premalignant oral
lesions (N=60) and will assess relevant protein expression and spatial localization via SAFE (Aim 1).
Subsequently, in Aim 2, we will evaluate the defining molecular and/or immunological signature(s) in a unique
set of patients (N=55) with serial biopsies documenting transformation from premalignancy to cancer over 20
years against a separate cohort of benign and premalignant lesions (N=155). From our dataset, we will
develop an oral cancer progression model that incorporates the host immune response for the first time to
improve risk assessment for malignant progression to a degree superior to what is currently possible."
10767911,"Using the pneumococcus as a model, our lab has revealed many features of the biochemical basis of
the inflammatory response to bacteria in the brain. The important discovery of this application is the
opening of a new area of pathogenesis at the maternal/fetal interface that will inform newly discovered
cell wall/TLR2 effects as a morphogen in the brain. We have determined that cell wall, a universal
pathogen associated molecular pattern, circulates in the bloodstream of pregnant mice and traverses the
placenta to the fetal brain. The response of fetal neurons is not the well characterized inflammation and
neuronal death of the postnatal setting but the exact opposite: neuroproliferation without inflammation.
This response involves two new activities of cell wall: 1) induction of cell proliferation via TLR2 without
inflammatory signaling, and 2) remodeling of embryonic brain anatomy and changes in postnatal
behavior. We will further determine the relevance of these findings to the human brain using organoids.
 An understanding of the details of this new biology, to be investigated in this application, represents
both novel bacterial pathogenesis and an avenue of high potential for tangible medical impact. Using
single cell spatial RNASeq and knock out animal models, we propose to identify the signaling cascade
initiated by cell wall to modulate brain structure, including determining the links between TLR2/6, the
signaling node of the neuronal cilium and the neuronal transcription factor FoxG1. This will connect
innate immune receptors to nuclear transcription factors for the first time and define a new activity of
TLRs as morphogens. The involvement of the LANDO autophagy pathway will be characterized as a cell
wall trafficking/removal pathway associated with defects in cognitive function."

recognized program in infection prevention among susceptible populations. She will achieve this objective by
conducting patient-oriented research that improves outcomes from infectious diseases and reduces
transmission of bacterial and viral infections in a vulnerable older population and by educating and training a
multidisciplinary group of mentees. The majority of her professional life has been dedicated to the conduct of
patient-oriented research. During the past 5 years, she has published 90 papers, including six articles
pertaining to career development and work-life balance. Fifty-three were as first or senior author (59% of 90)
and 59 publications were mentor/mentee collaborations (66% of 90). Several of her mentees have received
career development awards including GEMSSTAR, K awards and institutional career development grants
leading to independent academic careers and tenure track positions. She has established a steady stream of
research funding and effective mentorship, with continued collaboration throughout the course of mentees’
careers.
Dr. Mody’s research brings together expertise in geriatrics and aging research, microbiology and infectious
diseases, epidemiology, outcomes research, nursing, and others. Her work on reducing infections and
antimicrobial resistance in vulnerable populations grows out of work originally funded by the NIA, AHRQ,
CDC, T. Franklin Williams Scholarship (now known as GEMSSTAR), and the Hartford Foundation. Several
currently funded grants will serve as the platform for this grant proposal, including ongoing work funded by
NIH, AHRQ, VA, and the Kahn Foundation. These studies will yield rich datasets and banked microbes that
will be utilized to educate and train mentees in patient-oriented research with extensions to molecular
epidemiology and community-based participatory research. Resources supporting the education, training, and
development include the University of Michigan Medical School, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, UM
Department of Medicine, UM Department of Surgery, Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research
(MICHR, UM-CTSA), UM OAIC Pepper Center, and the UM School of Public Health."
10767917,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Optimizing early cognitive development is critical, as children with impaired cognition are at greater risk for
neuropsychiatric disorders later in life. While it is known that breastfeeding promotes better cognitive
development, few studies have identified specific components of breast milk that are involved in this process.
One component that may be relevant is a group of non-digestible complex carbohydrates known as human
milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). Animal studies reveal that certain HMOs enhance cognitive outcomes of
memory, attention, and impulse control, and the relationship may be driven by several mechanisms. First,
some HMOs are a source of sialic acid important for brain development. Second, HMOs are a source of
prebiotics important for gut microbe development, which is likely to play a role in cognitive development and a
focus of the parent R01. Although the first year of life is a critical window for brain development, it is unknown
whether HMOs affect structural-functional organization of infant cognition. In this application, Dr. Paige
Berger’s goal is to determine associations between HMOs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures
of infant brain development (brain white matter myelination, cortical maturation). During the K99 phase, she
will build on an existing NIH sponsored study (R01DK110793) by Dr. Michael Goran. In the parent R01,
Hispanic mothers and normal birth weight infants are being followed, with frequent assessment of HMOs up to
24 months. In the proposed project, Dr. Berger will leverage the data and resources on HMOs in a subset of
exclusively breastfeeding mother-infant pairs (n=65) at 1 and 6 months. Since brain white matter myelination
and cortical maturation were not measured in the parent R01, Dr. Berger will collect these in infants at 1 and 6
months. The K99 hypothesis is that in normal birth weight infants (≥2500 g), brain white matter myelination
and cortical maturation will be positively associated with HMOs. Dr. Berger will focus her K99 training on the
development of expertise in structural-functional organization of infant cognition, and hone her skills in
conducting clinical nutrition research in mother-infant pairs. She will learn the skills and techniques needed to
complete the proposed research under her expert team (Drs. Goran, Bradley Peterson, Lars Bode, Leann
Birch, Douglas Vanderbilt). Collectively, her expert team has a strong track record of training postdoctoral
scholars transitioning to independence. In the R00 phase, Dr. Berger will apply the skills acquired during the
mentored phase to initiate a new line of work in low birth weight infants (<2500 g), examining associations
between HMOs and cognitive development. The proposed work will provide Dr. Berger with data and support
to develop efficient and effective clinical trials, with future implications to validate the roles of HMOs that may
have positive effects on cognitive development in a high-risk infant population."
10768165,"Proteogenomics Shared Resource Summary
Proteogenomics integrates now-readily-available next-generation DNA/RNA sequencing data with high-
resolution mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data to identify and quantify expressed proteins. As a
Developing Shared Resource in the current funding period, Proteogenomics catalyzed numerous new
collaborations, which allowed the development of new tools and workflows. It also contributed to several
successful grant applications.
In the current application, it is proposed as a New Shared Resource. In the coming funding period, we will
continue to offer cutting-edge proteogenomic services to MCC members conducting basic, translational, and
clinical cancer research, guided by these Specific Aims: 1) Offer customizable and flexible workflows for
integrative, quantitative analysis of next-generation sequencing data and MS-based proteomics data to identify
novel protein products underlying cancer; 2) Offer a complete informatics workflow for identifying and
quantifying peptide neoantigens with promise for immuno-therapeutic applications; and 3) Offer validated and
emerging metaproteomics tools and workflows for studies of microbiome contributions to cancer.
The Proteogenomics Shared Resource is led by Director Dr. Tim Griffin (Genetic Mechanisms Program) and
Coordinator Dr. Pratik Jagtap, who are leaders of the Galaxy for proteomics (Galaxy-P) project. Both have long
track records in the application of proteogenomic and metaproteomic informatics to cancer research.
We anticipate that 30 researchers, including 21 MCC members, will use this Resource each year. Access to
the technologies offered by the Proteogenomics Shared Resource is free to users through the Minnesota
Supercomputing Institute. Some support for staff members is requested to allow them to work with MCC
members to design studies and generate preliminary data for grant applications."
10769037,"ABSTRACT (OVERALL)
The long-term goal of this NCBIB is to establish a national resource for enabling UHF (7T and above) magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) technologies to advance biomedical research and discovery. We propose to build on
our successes in this renewal with four new closely linked technical research and development (TRD) projects.
These projects will work synergistically to realize the potential of our unique imaging resources which include
our 10.5 Tesla (currently the highest magnetic field available for human and large non-human primate (NHP)
imagining above 10T), and 16.4 Tesla for small to medium size animal models (one of two such high fields
systems in the world). TRD1 will undertake the development of a multimodal imaging with simultaneous MR and
novel electrodes and augment its current effort on large NHPs with a small NHP model, namely the marmosets,
for use in 16.4T MR and multiphoton optical imaging studies. The combination of non-invasive MR and an
invasive technology will provide access to neuronal activity from single neuron and synapse level over the entire
brain but at a coarser spatiotemporal resolution. This platform will provide opportunities for detailed studies of
brain function in NHP models and inform future human studies using MRI alone. TRD2 will develop new MR
contrasts and novel technologies for ultrahigh field applications, with a specific focus on selected technologies
that will have the greatest impact on associated collaborative and service projects. The effort will provide
unparalleled sensitivity to probe molecular and physiological parameters to characterize tissue, support
biomedical research and impact our understanding of the living system in health and disease. TRD3 has been
at the forefront of image reconstruction technologies, introducing multiple new methods for improved Deep
Learning (DL) reconstruction and training, interpretable image denoising, and fast iterative algorithms. TRD3 will
continue to tackle inverse problems through the lens of intelligent physics-driven technologies that synergistically
utilize imaging physics and advances in DL methods targeting target higher resolutions and acceleration rates
at lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), as well as to combine information across multiple nuclei or even modalities.
TRD4 provides critical engineering solutions addressing both radiofrequency (RF) coil (i.e. antennae) designs
and safety, towards capturing the significantly higher ultimate intrinsic SNR (uiSNR) provided by UHF. The effort
will employ novel RF electronics concepts including miniaturized integrated circuit low noise amplifiers and coil
clusters and explore new receiver concepts both for multinuclear and 1H imaging and spectroscopy studies at
the high magnetic fields of 10.5T, 7T and 16.4T. While the focus is on uniquely high magnetic fields, the impact
of this Center on biomedical research will extend to lower magnetic fields, as it has done so already, as well as
to fields beyond MRI (cognitive science, neuroscience, senescence, musculoskeletal disorders, neurological
disorder, cancer among others)."
10769038,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ADMINISTRATION)
The National Center for Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering delivering “Technology to realize the full
potential of UHF MRI” has an Administrative Core that coordinates all NCBIB related activities, including the
development of ultrahigh field (UHF) magnetic resonance (MR) and optical imaging/MR technologies, their
dissemination, and training of researchers in their use. The co-PIs of this core are Drs. Kamil Ugurbil and Greg
Metzger. Dr. Ugurbil is an expert in UHF MR methodology and instrumentation with longstanding experience
managing multi-center collaborations. Dr. Metzger is an expert in UHF MR technology and its application with
experience developing and managing interdisciplinary research programs. Daily operations of the NCBIB are
the responsibility of the Co-PIs in close interaction with the Technology Research and Development (TRD)
project leads. The full leadership group of the NCBIB together with key Center faculty and staff managing
resources at the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR), comprises the Operations Committee,
which meets biweekly. The main goal of this committee is to assure that access to and use of the NCBIB
resources is accomplished in a fair and transparent manner including ensuring the push-pull relationship with
the Collaborative Projects and a path for access to the technology developments for the Service Projects. The
task of the Operations Committee is facilitated by operating procedures and tools which help manage requests
and prioritize projects, including both 1) a web-based interface for requesting access to Center resources and 2)
faculty and staff support to guide users in the process. Additional infrastructure in the Center is available to
ensure projects can be carried out in a safe and successful manner including the following: Pre-IRB Review
System, Incidental Findings Review System, 3T Operations Committee, Safety Committee and Magnet Operator
Training. The progress of the NCBIB is reviewed yearly by the External Advisory Committee (EAC) comprised
of experts in the fields of our TRDs. The primary role of the EAC will be to annually review our scientific progress
and our progress in collaboration, service, training, and dissemination goals. The results from the meeting will
be incorporated into a yearly report drafted by the EAC, which will be submitted to NIBIB as part of the annual
progress report. Through the activities of the administrative core and the consistent and substantive institutional
support from the University of Minnesota, our long-term goal is the establishment of a national biotechnology
research resource for the development of unique technologies that advance biomedical research and discovery."
10769040,"ABSTRACT – TRD2
Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy are valuable modalities providing unique information for the
molecular and physiological characterization of tissue. The breadth of both endogenous and exogenous
molecular imaging contrasts in combination with high resolution functional and anatomic imaging motivate the
continued development of the methods, their biomedical applications and clinical translation. The potential to
improve MRI sensitivity to markers of molecular dynamics, metabolism, energetics, and critical processes
continue to drive the development of MRI methods to higher and higher magnetic fields. The 10.5T whole-body
MRI systems in our lab offers a comprehensive imaging platform to provide unprecedented access to molecular
and functional information non-invasively. It has been shown that sensitivity, as measured by the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), scales supralinearly with the static field strength which can be leveraged to increase spatial and/or
temporal resolution. To realize these potential gains the need remains for continued innovation with respect to
acquisition methods, MRI contrasts, RF management strategies, novel RF hardware, and state of the art
reconstruction and quantification approaches. To address this need, the overall goal of this project is to develop
novel technologies for ultra-high field applications, with a specific focus on selected methods that will have the
greatest impact on the field and advance developments made in the first phase of this NCBIB. To accomplish
this goal, we will focus on four areas. First, we will integrate dual-tuned RF coils in a parallel transmit (pTx)
enabled multinuclear platform and exploit its functionality through introducing novel RF optimization and
acquisition strategies. Second, we will introduce novel rotating frame relaxation (RFR) relaxation metrics and the
strategies that allow us to conduct these experiments at UHF. Third, we will develop strategies for obtaining high
resolution arterial spin labeling as a biomarker of angiogenesis and an important parameter towards deciphering
the neurovascular coupling occurring during brain activation. Fourth, we will explore new post processing
methods that work synergistically with UHF to provide minimally biased estimates of quantitative parameters for
domain specific applications in the presence of increasing amounts of noise as we push temporal and spatial
resolutions. Achieving these aims will advance access to molecular and physiological parameters to characterize
tissue, support biomedical research and impact our understanding of the living system in health and disease.
The challenges addressed in this project are relevant for all UHF systems including 7T which recently received
clinical approval. As such, the impact of the proposed technologies extends well beyond 10.5T."
10769041,"Project Summary/Abstract
Image reconstruction has been an integral part of MRI technology development over the past decades,
spanning techniques such as parallel imaging, compressed sensing, low-rank matrix models, methods for
novel encoding strategies/k-space trajectories, and more recently deep learning (DL) approaches. Our TRD in
the first phase has been at the forefront of these developments, introducing multiple new technologies for
improved DL reconstruction and training, interpretable image denoising, and fast iterative algorithms, which
were applied to Cartesian, non-Cartesian and novel encoding strategies beyond Fourier encoding. These new
MRI reconstruction methods have also pushed the imaging technologies in other TRDs, CPs and SPs forward
to target higher resolutions and acceleration rates at lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), as well as to combine
information across multiple nuclei or even modalities. Consequently, these targets necessitate newer
technologies for image reconstruction and denoising, an interplay with image acquisition, and new approaches
for multi-nuclei and multi-modal computational imaging. Each of these directions correspond to a specific
inverse problem with its own distinct forward operator dictated by the underlying imaging physics.
Our goal in this TRD is to link these inverse problems through the lens of intelligent physics-driven
technologies that synergistically utilize imaging physics and advances in DL methods. For accelerated high-
resolution imaging, which remains a focal point for our TRD, we will develop a new computational imaging
pipeline that explicitly combines interpretable denoising methods and physics-driven DL reconstruction. These
will be complemented by new technologies for improved denoising of MR image series, and for self-supervised
training of physics-driven DL reconstruction from few examples without ground-truth data. On the acquisition
side, we will concentrate on parallel transmit technology for UHF imaging. We will tackle issues related to the
high computational complexity and sub-optimality of existing methods by proposing an unsupervised DL
approach. We will then augment this strategy by incorporating hard constraints on maximum voltage, power
and specific-absorption-rate into DL optimization. We will further investigate new classification-type strategies
for pulse selection towards calibration-free parallel transmit. Finally, we will also pursue developments for
multi-nuclei MRI and multi-modal neuroimaging. For the former, we will develop a physics-driven DL framework
for joint reconstruction of simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclei acquisitions, using signal intensity informed
multi-coil encoding operators and an additional cyclic loss term to ensure consistency across the different
proton and x-nuclei resolutions. For the latter, we will adapt our interpretable motion-insensitive denoising
strategies to optical imaging, incorporating new forward operators and noise models, while decoupling motion
correction from denoising."
10769042,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall objective of TRD4 is to develop innovative engineering solutions required to support the other TRDs
and various collaborative and service projects in this P41 NCBIB. One of the most important issues that needs
to be addressed, particularly while developing new ultra-high field MR technologies, is to ensure the overall MR
related safety of the technology. We propose a new method for evaluating the RF safety of custom-built coils
using an automated EM field measurement system. The proposed approach will allow safety evaluation with low
power settings in a comprehensive manner.
Supra-linear gains are expected with increasing field strength, however achieving these SNR gains in real life is
a challenging engineering problem. Design and implementation of new RF coil technologies are essential for this
goal. We will focus on developing novel RF coil designs that combine different coil geometries (e.g. loops and
non-uniform dielectric substrate dipoles or sleeve antennas). We will also utilize novel RF electronics concepts
including miniaturized integrated circuit low noise amplifiers and coil clusters to improve coil performance. To
enhance SNR we will explore new receiver concepts and will investigate the possibility of harvesting the sheath
currents flowing on receive coaxial cable circuity to further improve SNR. Combining these approaches, we will
aim to capture the physically achievable limits of SNR in UHF MRI. We will translate the extensive prior
experience we have developing human brain and body as well as awake and anesthetize NHP array technology
at 10.5T along with the more recent insights to optimally capture central and peripheral SNR towards the design
of optimized multi-channel transceiver/receiver arrays for 16.4T/700 MHz studies of marmosets. Particularly
promising and impactful here is the integration of field orientation insensitive miniature IC preamplifiers of sub-
cm scale which allow for on-coil amplification without line-of-sight restrictions. Finally, we plan to expand this
extensive UHF technology expertise and the associated cumulative gains towards multinuclear coil technology
with the aim of simultaneous optimization of Efficiency and SNR for dual nuclei."
10769308,"Project Summary/Abstract: The primary goal of the Biospecimen/Pathology Core B is to facilitate
translational research related to prostate tissue-based studies. The major functions of the core are to collect,
annotate, provide quality control/quality assurance measures, develop standard operating procedures, catalog
specimens within databases, improve operations, and test and implement new technologies for interrogating
biomarkers in tissue-based studies. Core B has appropriate informatics capabilities for tracking biospecimens,
as well as linkage to clinical follow-up data sets. For the majority of our specimens in the repository, the
essential pathological, clinical and family history information is available. In addition, we utilize FFPE cell line
tissue blocks from cells with known genetic features as well as cell line tissue microarray’s (TMAs); these serve
as standardized reference specimens for biomarker validation studies. Core B has a well-established history of
supplying tissues and their derivatives to multiple investigators, performing immunohistochemical workups and
staining protocols, testing and implementing new immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization technologies,
performing research on biospecimens to determine optimal methods for preparations of DNA, RNA and
protein. New functions have been and are being further developed for laser capture microdissection of frozen
metastatic prostate cancer biopsies for genomic studies, and of FFPE tissues for immune-oncology studies
relevant to the Research Projects in the current SPORE application. These include implementation of
HALO™ algorithms for quantifying AR and MYC as well as specific inflammatory cell types in tumors using
singleplex and multiplex IHC and Digital Spatial Profiling for protein and high content RNA studies. The core
has also collaborated with and shared tools and biospecimens with many other investigators both within and
outside the SPORE program, both within our institution as well as a number of others throughout the country."
10768622,"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) affects ~190,000 patients and causes ~75,000 deaths per year
in the U.S.A. ARDS has a mortality rate of ~40% and causes significant morbidity in survivors. Respiratory
viruses, including influenza and now Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), are
important causes of ARDS with limited therapeutic options. The VA patient population has many of the risk
factors for having poor outcomes with ARDS, including older age, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic
lung and heart disease. There are no currently available pharmacologic therapies proven to be effective in
ARDS. To address this need, we developed a novel class of substrate- and function-selective p38 mitogen-
activated protein kinases (MAPK) inhibitors with anti-inflammatory and endothelial-barrier stabilizing activity.
Compared with conventional p38 catalytic inhibitors that block all downstream signaling including anti-
inflammatory pathways, our novel compounds target one of the substrate docking sites and therefore only
block certain p38-dependent processes. Together with my co-investigators, Drs. Shapiro, MacKerell, and
Fletcher, we used computer-aided drug design (CADD) to identify a lead compound, UM101, that binds a
pocket near the ED substrate docking site on p38a and exhibits a unique profile of biological activities. We
developed a second-generation analog, SF7044, with greater solubility and improved endothelial barrier-
stabilizing, anti-inflammatory, and lung-protective activities. We are currently collaborating with Gen1e Life
Sciences, LLC, which licensed the patents for these compounds, completed preclinical testing and began
clinical testing of SF7044. During our current Merit Award, we identified and screened 200 additional
compounds targeted to the same substrate docking site as UM101 using a refined CADD strategy. We
identified four new lead compounds with superior endothelial barrier stabilizing activity and p38a-binding
compared with UM101 and SF7044 and distinct anti-inflammatory effect profiles, but poor solubility. In vivo
testing in a mouse model will require reformulation or chemical modification of these new lead compounds to
improve solubility (like UM101). The overall objective of this renewal is to use the same strategy as used for
development of SF7044 to design, synthesize, and characterize second-generation analogs of the four new
lead compounds with improved activity and drug-like properties. Since the new lead compounds have greater
endothelial-stabilizing activity and p38a-binding than either UM101 or SF7044 we expect to develop second-
generation analogs with substantially improved lung-protective activity. We will utilize CADD and medicinal
chemistry principles, protein binding assays and human cell and mouse models of ALI:
1. Design and synthesize at least 20 analogs of each the 4 newly discovered lead compounds to improve
p38a-binding and drug-like properties.
2. Analyze the second-generation analogs for target binding and biological activities.
3. Analyze toxicity and effectiveness of the most active second-generation analogs in mouse models of the
exudative (LPS/hyperthermia) and fibroproliferative (bleomycin) phases of ARDS.
4. Evaluate new compounds for off-target effects
At the conclusion of this work, we will have developed second generation analogs of novel non-catalytic
p38α inhibitors with improved efficacy and safety profiles in mouse lung injury models to provide a pipeline
of new compounds that are ready for advanced preclinical testing prior to clinical testing in ARDS."
10768623,"Over half of the 5.8 million Americans who suffer from dementia have Vascular contributions to Cognitive
Impairment and Dementia (VCID), for which there are NO effective treatments. The focus on neuronal
pathologies of the disease limited our understanding of the cellular/molecular mechanisms that promote the
onset and progression of cognitive decline at the neural-glial-vascular (NGV) interface and stalled the
development of any effective therapeutic strategies. While it is known that diabetes increases the risk and
severity of VCID, the inadequate integration of diabetes experimental VCID research has widened this vast
knowledge gap. The specific objective of this renewal proposal is to address these gaps by defining cellular
mechanisms contributing to the progressive disruption of the NGV unit using diabetes and stroke as disease
models. While neurological diseases have long been categorized as vascular, neurodegenerative or
inflammatory, it is now recognized that these mechanisms are interwoven. Our exciting findings in the past
funding period led us to focus on the mechanisms of complex interaction within the NGVU: 1) diabetic male and
female rats display cognitive deficits that are worsened after stroke and accompanied by exhibit extensive
remodeling at the NGV interface, 2) cells that survive initial injury lose their neurotrophic/proangiogenic
properties and become inflamed in both sexes, 3) mature brain derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF) is
decreased while proapoptotic proBDNF & its cognate receptor p75NTR are increased in the diabetic brain and
brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs), 4) unlike control rats that show a dynamic switch between
anti/pro-inflammatory microglia after stroke, diabetic rats display sustained proinflammatory microglia and
microglia knockdown in the early poststroke period improves sensorimotor and cognitive outcomes, 5)
endothelial expression of senescent markers is amplified in diabetic rats after ischemic injury, 6) interleukin-1
(IL-1), its receptor and phosphorylated tau (p~tau) are increased in BMVECs under inflammatory stress, and
7) cilostazol, a clinically approved vasodilator with senostatic/anti-inflammatory properties that is on current
clinical trials for the prevention of progressive cognitive impairment in stroke survivors, improves endothelial
inflammation as well as cognition in diabetic rats. Two aims with translational and mechanistic studies will test
the central hypothesis is that diabetes-mediated premature endothelial senescence promotes vasotrophic
uncoupling and endothelial tau pathology, collectively propagating senescence-associated inflammation within
the NGVU after brain injury leading to progressive VCID. Aim 1 will determine the causal role of endothelial
(e)senescence in progressive VCID in diabetes by defining a) a) the impact of cell specific inhibition of
senescence via endothelial (e)p16 knockdown or intranasal delivery of cilostazol in VCAM1-tagged
nanoparticles on the evolution of NGVU senescence/dysfunction and cognitive deficits using innovative Hyperion
imaging mass cytometry and complex automated behavior analyses; b) tempora/spatial development of e-
inflammation using ultra-sensitive VCAM1-tagged molecular magnetic resonance imaging (mMRI); c) the
comparative impact of cilostazol on cognitive decline in both sexes; and d) the most effective tactics by which
elimination of e-senescence improves VCID. Aim 2 will determine the mechanisms by which e-senescence
drives NGVU senescence by defining a the role(s) of dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase
1A (DYRK1A) in IL1R1-mediated p~tau and mBDNF decrease; b) the impact of endothelial IL1R1 silencing on
cognitive deficits; and c) the impact of e-senescence on NGVU senescence and functions using creative media
transfer experiments. Given that Veterans disproportionately suffer from cardiometabolic risk factors and VCID,
identification of innovative and effective mechanism-based therapeutic approaches that would prevent, retard
and/or dampen the onset and progression of cognitive impairment, including a rapidly translatable senostatic
therapy by repurposing of cilostazol, will have a significant impact on human health and the VA mission."
10770568,"Summary
The Administrative Core supports productive interactions between the different projects and cores, and facilitates
communication and data exchange between all associated personnel and the external advisory board (EAB).
The Administrative Core monitors the progress of each project, and the effective utilization of service core
resources. Importantly, the core will provide fiscal management, ensuring that all funds are utilized efficiently to
support the Program Project’s mission. A key core activity is to organize an annual review by the EAB, in the
context of a Program Project retreat, where project leaders and trainees will report on scientific progress. This
event will complement the monthly project leader meetings, and will foster integrated scientific interactions
between scientists working in the project leaders’ laboratories and core facilities. In addition, the core will facilitate
training sessions, enabling trainees at Tulane to receive training at UF in Recombinant Viral Genetics (Core C),
and to provide hands-on bioinformatics training at Tulane (Core B) for UF trainees. We note that travel costs for
these training-specific activities will be provided as institutional support by the University of Florida. Core A will
support the timely publication of findings from the P01 components. Finally, the core will securely archive
research data, share data between groups, and disseminate results with the scientific community after
publication. To facilitate these goals, the core maintains a Program Project-specific website in close coordination
with Cores B, C, and D and Projects 1, 2 and 3."
10770570,"Summary
Computational biology is becoming increasingly integral to biological science research as relentless
technological advances increase the capabilities and depth of data that is put at arm’s reach of investigators.
Computational biology and bioinformatics resources are even more critical for the RNA-centric goals of this P01.
In the previous project period, Core B worked to provide effective and timely computational biology and
bioinformatics services to P01 investigators, resulting in 11 Core B-associated publications. In addition to Core
B working to improve capabilities and efficiency, it provided custom analysis software for project-specific needs,
and provided computational biology and bioinformatics training to junior P01 investigators. Specifically, Core B
reduced data processing times of standard analysis pipelines for RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq through
the development of automated comprehensive analysis software that operates on the Tulane University and
University of Florida High Performance Computer (HPC) clusters. These pipelines substantially cut primary data-
to-interpretation times, and their comprehensive nature provides high value to P01 personnel. The automated
nature of these pipelines also reduces Core B personnel operation time, allowing them to dedicate more effort
to other tasks, such as development of new computational methods and teaching. During the previous project
period, Core B also developed more than 7 software packages in direct response to the needs of Projects 1, 2
and 3. Lastly, Core B utilized a multipronged approach to train junior P01 investigators, arming them with
powerful computer programming and data analysis skills that will help them take advantage of the growing
importance of computational biology and bioinformatics in biomedical science. In the next project period, Core B
will continue to provide rapid and comprehensive services to P01 investigators, increase the efficiency and
capabilities of Core B, develop new software packages to meet the needs of Projects 1, 2, and 3, and continue
to train the next generation of gammaherpesvirologists in computational biology and bioinformatics."
10770484,"Abstract
Sensory perception requires the coordinated activity of tens of thousands of neurons, working together in large-
scale functional networks. Developmental events define and constrain the ultimate capabilities of these networks,
therefore it is essential to understand the mechanisms underlying their formation. In the visual cortex of primates
and carnivores, columnar networks of orientation preference extend across millimeters of cortical surface. Prior
to eye-opening, such large-scale networks are already evident in correlated spontaneous activity, whose
structure can predict future visually-evoked responses. However, a major gap in our ability to relate early network
structure to mature sensory function is the lack of knowledge of the circuit mechanisms through which millimeter-
scale correlated activity is generated in the early cortex. The experiments in this proposal will address this gap
and test the hypothesis that large-scale correlated networks in the early cortex are generated by propagating
activity through purely short-range intracortical connections and are refined through the emergence and
elaboration of monosynaptic horizontal projections. By employing wide-field calcium imaging in early visual
cortex, the experiments in this proposal will directly assess propagation in early spontaneous activity. A key
prediction of our hypothesis is the interdependence of cortical domains in generating correlated activity. We will
test this by determining whether local pharmacological or optogenetic silencing of cortical activity leads to a
global disruption of correlated network activity. In order to identify the contribution of inhibitory neurons to the
structure of correlated networks in the early cortex, we will utilize inhibitory-neuron specific labelling and 2-photon
calcium imaging, together with targeted optogenetic manipulations. Finally, as these early correlated networks
undergo refinement during the same period that long-range horizontal projections begin to elaborate in layer 2/3,
we will combine anatomical labeling with longitudinal functional imaging of spontaneous activity. This will allow
us to determine whether emerging horizontal connections link domains that are already functionally correlated,
or instead act to reshape functional networks in the early visual cortex. Together, these studies will provide
critical new insights into the circuit mechanisms governing the formation and refinement of large-scale correlated
networks in the early cortex. In doing so, they will provide a key framework for understanding how the patterns
of early cortical activity establish the organization of developing cortical networks and impact later sensory
perception."
10768105,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Preterm birth (PTB) and related intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) affects 15 million babies a year globally
(~11% of births) and is linked to chronic diseases in adulthood. Infection-mediated PTB is associated with ~40%
of all PTBs, but not all maternal infections elicit PTB. The placenta is a primary mediator of this protection and
expresses protective Interferons (e.g., IFNb) which play a critical role in placental immune regulation. Co-I Gil
Mor has shown that downregulation of protective IFNb at the site of the placenta allows for a secondary bacteria
insult to elicit an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction that would otherwise have been benign. Recent
epidemiological and preclinical work shows that certain classes of environmental pollutants are
immunosuppressive and can inhibit IFN signaling. Per-and poly fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of
ubiquitous man-made chemicals utilized for their surfactant properties in cookware, clothing, and carpets as well
as in foams used by firefighters and are found in the environment as mixtures. A handful of model PFAS have
been associated with preterm birth and decreased fetal growth. PFAS are established immunosuppressants
have reproducibly been shown to be associated with decreased IFN signaling in mice or humans and have been
linked to increased severity or incidence of infections. PFAS target the placenta and can decrease IFN signaling
in trophoblasts, but mechanistic studies investigating the role of decreased IFN as it relates to increased
susceptibility to a second hit during pregnancy are lacking. Thus, we hypothesize that PFAS exposure leads to
dysregulation of type 1 (i.e., IFNb) and/or type 2 (IFNg) responses in the placenta and is responsible for a
dysregulated inflammatory response to a secondary bacterial infection resulting in IUGR and PTB.
IFN signaling can be regulated by modulating IFN levels at the site of infection, or through regulation of IFN
receptors by post-translational modifications (PTMs), primarily by glycosylation. Biochemical labeling tools now
exist that allow for spatial analysis of glycosylated proteins at the resolution of single cells. No group has used
sugar labeling to track effects of PFAS on placental inflammation, especially as it relates to IFNs.
This Katz award will allow Dr. Petriello, a toxicologist and early-stage investigator to transition to study
inflammation within critical windows of susceptibility (pregnancy) and impacts on placental health and birth
outcomes. For this Katz award we will expose pregnant mice to concentrations of PFAS previously shown to
decrease IFN signaling as well as lead to IUGR, and then expose to a bacterial stressor which we predict will
elicit preterm delivery. Our aims are: 1. To test the hypothesis that maternal exposures to PFAS lead to
decreased IFN signaling and induce placental toxicity. 2. To test the hypothesis that N- and O-glycoprotein
distribution is altered specifically in spongiotrophoblasts of the placenta upon gestational PFAS exposure in vivo.
3. To test the hypothesis that maternal exposures to PFAS increase susceptibility of subsequent bacterial
infection and preterm delivery which is mediated through IFN-signaling at the site of the placenta."

For the past thirty years, FlyBase has provided a centralized resource for Drosophila genetic and genomic data
to enable a community of over 4000 research laboratories to further their research. Drosophila is one of the
premier model organisms that provides cost-effective help in elucidating the etiology of human genetic
diseases. FlyBase provides expert curation, controlled vocabularies (ontologies), and community access to a
broad array of Drosophila research data and resources, including genome annotations, transcriptomics data,
information about mutant and transgenic fly stocks, and much more. The value of this information extends to
the study of human health and disease. Future progress in functional genomics in Drosophila depends on
FlyBase to keep up-to-date with the literature. To achieve these goals, FlyBase works closely with other model
organism databases (MODs) and the Alliance of Genome Resources (Alliance). Our resource development
plan has three Aims. Aim 1. Improve curation and data utilization. We will: 1) improve the efficiency of
curation by assessing the priority of the curated data for the research community and focusing on the highest
priority data, and improve the technical curation process; 2) utilize the time freed up by increased efficiency to
add new data types to FlyBase to match new directions in the field; and 3) help the community make the best
use of the data in FlyBase by providing integrated summaries, including visual representations, and improved
searching. Aim 2: Maintain and strengthen the FlyBase ecosystem. FlyBase synergizes with a number of
other databases in order to enhance access to Drosophila data and tools by the research community. These
efforts help maximize the utility of resources at all sites and distribute high-quality curated information to
multiple websites, tools, etc. Our collaborators include the Alliance, the EBI Single Cell Expression Atlas, the
Virtual Fly Brain project, the DRSC Functional Genomics Resources, and the Gene Ontology Consortium. Aim
3: Harmonization and transfer of FlyBase data and processes into the Alliance. FlyBase is a founding
member of the Alliance whose goals are to harmonize model organism and human data and make it
accessible to a variety of users following FAIR plus 5 principles. We will further integrate actively curated
Drosophila data and develop processes and tools to import and export these data to and from the Alliance.
This effort will have a major impact on multiple research and clinical communities, including the fly community,
by accelerating the development of integrative analyses and approaches for fly models of human diseases."

Activities of daily living (e.g., brushing one’s teeth) require a slew of brain regions to rapidly coordinate their
responses to drive sequences of movements over long timescales. Recent progress resulting from applying
classical tools from physical science and engineering to develop theories regarding how neural activity evolves
across time has led to a number of new treatment options for movement disorders (e.g., motor prosthetics, deep
brain stimulation, etc.). Activities of daily living, however, require production of complex cognitive-motor
sequences. For example, motor cortex, which is the primary site for a large number of investigations for neural
prosthetics applications, is only sensitive to the upcoming movement. Even a simple movement involving two
arm reaches performed in succession, requires input from upstream brain regions. Thus, if we hope to restore
the ability to orchestrate long timescale actions, we need to expand our scientific focus to study network-level
interactions between brain regions. Relevant upstream areas include the supplementary motor area (SMA),
which has been implicated in tracking and coordinating action sequences, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(dlPFC), which has been hypothesized to specify the correct order in which movements should be performed.
Despite decades of research in the function of these areas, we still lack a concrete theory that describes the
computations of these areas, characterizes their interactions, and proposes a mechanism of how they work
together to orchestrate movement sequences. This project will attempt to fill this gap.
 This project will test the central hypothesis that movement sequences arise from the coordinated action
of cortical regions that divide computational labor in specific ways. In particular, this project will investigate two
fundamental questions. First, how does the brain (hypothesis: dlPFC) choose the right order in which to perform
a movement sequence. Second, how does a brain area upstream of motor cortex (hypothesis: SMA) convert an
abstract sequence of actions into movement commands that can be transmitted downstream in the right way at
the right time. This project will test these hypotheses through a combination of developing a complex cognitive-
motor task, acquiring large-scale simultaneously recorded measurements of neural activity using state-of-the-art
electrophysiology tools, performing high-dimensional data analysis, and developing sophisticated neural network
models of interacting brain regions. This project will facilitate direct interdisciplinary interactions between
experimental motor neurophysiologist and theoretical neuroscientists at Columbia University. Moreover, the
long-term objectives of this proposal will contribute to the core goal of NINDS by acquiring fundamental
knowledge about movement control as it relates to development of therapeutics.
 The outcome of this project will result in key computational principles that underlie how the interaction
between cortical regions gives rise to our ability to plan, orchestrate, and guide movements over long timescales."
10768170,"Energy homeostasis is controlled by neural circuits which sense changes in energy demands to maintain
body weight at a stable set point. Although body weight is remarkably stable in mammals, females must
temporarily increase their energy intake during pregnancy and lactation to accommodate the massive
energy demands associated with reproduction. During lactation, mice increase their food intake by 300-
400 percent, and similar changes in energy intake occur in humans during lactation. These adaptive
changes are critical for the long-term health of the mother and child, as excessive or insufficient energy
intake during lactation increases the subsequent risk of both the mother and child developing metabolic
and psychiatric disorders later in life. This is especially apparent during lactation since critical feeding and
motivational circuitry do not fully develop until the end of the lactation period in mice, and alterations in
energy intake during this period result in long-lasting perturbations in metabolic, reward, and motivational
circuitry. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to human health to determine the mechanism(s)
mediating the elevated food intake associated with lactation.
Although hypothalamic hunger circuitry, hindbrain satiety circuits, and reward based feeding circuitry are
critical for normal feeding behavior, it remains unclear how these circuits are altered during lactation.
Further, the neural circuitry and molecular mechanism(s) mediating the hyperphagia of lactation are
unknown. We hypothesize that lactation results in widespread functional changes in hypothalamic,
hindbrain, and midbrain reward circuitry, which together act to promote feeding during lactation. In this
proposal we will leverage recent advances in neural circuit manipulation, single nuclei transcriptomics,
and in vivo imaging approaches to determine the functional neuroanatomy mediating increased feeding
during lactation in mice. Together these studies will provide the foundation for therapeutic strategies
aiming to improve the metabolic health of both the mother and child, while uncovering fundamental
differences in the neural circuitry regulating feeding between the sexes."

This training program in mechanisms of viral infection will train 7 predoctoral students and 3 postdoctoral
fellows per year. The goal of this training grant is to provide students who 1) are well trained in the study of
mechanisms of viral replication, 2) can investigate human viruses causing disease, such as the human
immunodeficiency virus and herpes viruses, 3) can investigate new antiviral compounds and vaccines to
prevent or treat viral diseases, 4) can study viruses that are emerging threats to human health, and 5) can use
viruses to probe the cellular and molecular biology of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Nearly all of the
predoctoral applicants will have an undergraduate education in biology or chemistry. All of the predoctoral
trainees will be graduate students in the Program in Virology, an inter-faculty degree-granting program. The
laboratories of the training faculty are located at Harvard Medical School and affiliated hospitals, Harvard
School of Public Health, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Children's Hospital, and the Harvard University
Fairchild Laboratory in Cambridge. The Program in Virology students pursue a broad biological program of
study with courses in virology, molecular biology and genetics, biochemistry, cell biology and immunology.
These students will also attend seminars, research meetings, and perform 3 laboratory rotations. Faculty
curriculum advisors will provide guidance for the students throughout their training, and they will choose their
advisors from the Program in Virology faculty. Students will take a preliminary qualifying examination during
their second year, and within 6 months form a dissertation advisory committee to provide advice on the
progress of their research. Upon successful completion and defense of the dissertation, the student will be
awarded a Ph.D. degree in virology. Postdoctoral training takes place in the laboratories of the training faculty.
Consistent with the specialized nature of postdoctoral training, the primary program will be designed by the
faculty advisor. This training program is designed to augment that training by engaging the postdoctoral fellow
in virology program retreats, courses, and seminars. Postdoctoral trainees will form a postdoctoral advisory
committee that will meet at least annually to evaluate research and career paths. Predoctoral and postdoctoral
trainees will participate in a training program in the ethical conduct of science. An active and previously
successful program by the training faculty and Division of Medical Sciences is described for the recruitment of
underrepresented minority trainees."

The human brain is composed of an exceptionally high diversity of cells and brain function is orchestrated by
complex interactions of these different types of cells. The enormous cellular diversity and complex
organization of the brain have so far hindered our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms
underlying brain function. To date, it is still unclear how many different types of cells are present in the human
brain and how they are organized. We have previously developed a spatially resolved single-cell genomics
method, Multiplexed Error Robust Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (MERFISH), which allows in situ gene-
expression profiling of individual cells and hence in situ identification and spatial mapping of transcriptionally
distinct cell types in complex tissue, including the brain. However, the technical limitations of MERFISH still
prohibit a comprehensive spatial analysis of cell types and states across the entire human brain. In this
project, we will extend MERFISH to enable higher imaging speed/throughput, 3D volumetric imaging, and
epigenomic-transcriptomic multimodal imaging, and we will use these approaches to identify cell types and
cell states, map their spatial organization, and predict cell-type-specific cell-cell interactions in the human
brain, including the aging brain. In Aim 1, we will develop methods to drastically increase MERFISH imaging
speed/throughput (by 10-fold or more) and to enable 3D volumetric MERFISH imaging of thick tissue samples,
which will further increase the imaging throughput and greatly improve our ability to capture and map cell-cell
interactions. We will also extend MERFISH to allow spatially resolved single-cell profiling of not only histone
modifications but also DNA modifications, and combine transcriptomic and epigenomic MERFISH to enable
spatial multi-omics. In Aim 2, we will use the above-described approaches to generate spatially resolved cell
atlases and cell-cell interaction maps of several human brain regions, including several cortical regions
(prefrontal cortex, primary motor cortex, primary visual cortex, and middle temporal gyrus), several regions in
the basal ganglia (caudoputamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus), and the
preoptic region of the hypothalamus. In Aim 3, we will use the MERFISH technology, including the newly
developed capabilities described above, to study the human prefrontal cortex from donors of different ages,
including advanced ages, to characterize how the composition, cell state, spatial organization, and cell-cell
interactions of molecularly defined cell types in the prefrontal cortex change during aging. Our proposed
studies will provide fundamental insights into the molecular and cellular architecture of the human brain and
how it changes during aging."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in the
U.S. that affects 5.7 million Americans. There is no cure for AD and it has been 15 years since the latest AD
drug, Memantine, was approved by the FDA. Remarkably, AD patients show fluctuations of cognitive function
in the course of hours or days. This behavior cannot be explained by the sudden loss or gain of neurons,
neurofibrillary tangles or beta-amyloid plaques. Instead, lucid moments experienced by AD patients likely
represent emergence of normal neuronal network activity that is disrupted by pathological events in the AD
brain. In both AD patients and mouse models of AD, neuronal network hypersynchrony (epileptiform
discharges and seizures) and altered oscillatory network activity (brain rhythms) are observed. Recent
discoveries show that inhibitory interneuron dysfunction is a key upstream mechanism leading to network
hypersynchrony, decreased behavior-dependent gamma oscillatory power and impaired cognitive function in
the J20 model of AD. Deficits in inhibitory interneurons are found in both AD patients and mouse models of AD
where levels of the voltage-gated sodium channel subunit Nav1.1 are decreased in the parietal cortex. Nav1.1
is predominantly expressed in the parvalbumin (PV)-positive inhibitory interneurons, which generate gamma
oscillatory activity that increases during sensorimotor and cognitive. PV interneurons are critical in modulating
cognition-associated gamma oscillatory activity, however, the in vivo functional deficits of PV interneurons and
how PV interneurons contribute to disrupted gamma rhythms and network hypersynchrony in AD is unknown.
Using in vivo two-photon imaging, electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and behavioral assessments, the
relationship between in vivo PV cell activity and altered gamma oscillations in behaving head-fixed J20 mice
will be determined (Aim 1). Furthermore, Long-term EEG recordings will help to dissect the role of PV
interneurons in brain-state- and disease-state-dependent network hypersynchrony (Aim 2). Completion of the
first two aims during the mentored phase of this award will allow the full development of an innovative
technique, which enables a new research direction towards the interaction of inhibitory interneurons with other
cell types in the brain to determine the cause and effect of interneuron dysfunction in AD. During the
independent phase of this award, Aim 3 investigates how in vivo dysfunction of PV interneurons causes
dysregulation of excitatory neuron activity contributing to altered oscillatory activity and network
hypersynchrony in J20 mice. Genetic Nav1.1 overexpression will be used to modulate PV cell function to gain
further mechanistic insight in all three aims. The long-term goal is to understand how inhibitory interneurons
modulate oscillatory rhythms in the brain to alter cognitive function. This mechanistic insight could potentially
lead to improvement of cognitive function in AD patients by manipulating inhibitory interneurons and network
function, similar to AD patients having lucid moments, irrespective of other pathologies in the brain."
10749938,"Alpha herpesviruses, including important human pathogen Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) and zoonotic pathogen Pseudorabies Virus (PRV), are among the very few viruses that have evolved to exploit highly-specialized neuronal cell biology. During the natural course of disease, alpha herpesviruses infect sensory and autonomic neurons of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS). Upon reactivation, progeny virus particles undergo polarized intracellular trafficking and exocytosis at particular sub-cellular sites to spread from cell to cell, which is the subject of this proposal. In PNS neurons, this intracellular trafficking can include sorting into axons for long-distance transport into peripheral tissues, leading to recurrence of herpetic or zosteriform lesions, or to the Central Nervous System (CNS). The human alpha herpesviruses, and HSV-1 in particular, are leading causes of viral encephalitis. In Aim 1, we will investigate the viral factors that our preliminary data suggest modulate intracellular transport in non-neuronal cells, immediately prior to exocytosis, using existing reagents in PRV, and extending to HSV-1. In Aim 2, we will investigate the post-Golgi constitutive secretory pathway mechanisms that direct HSV-1 particle trafficking and exocytosis to particular sub-cellular sites in non- neuronal cells, and which we hypothesize also mediate polarized trafficking and exocytosis in neurons. Using innovative methods to acutely perturb particular cellular factors and directly image virus particle exocytosis, we will determine the role of secretory pathway mechanisms in intracellular trafficking and egress of virus particles, comparing non-neuronal cells to primary PNS neurons. In Aim 3, we will focus on the microtubule motor-based mechanisms that mediate axonal sorting, specifically in PNS neurons. Using a microfluidics-like chambered neuronal culture system and live-cell imaging, we will determine the roles of different kinesin motors and microtubule-associated proteins in axonal sorting of HSV-1 particles. Elucidating the basic cell biological processes that our viruses use in both neurons and non-neuronal cells will increase our understanding of how and why herpesviruses spread to and within the nervous system, lead to the identification of druggable targets and development of better therapies for viral neuropathology, and may provide fundamental insights into cell biology, particularly of the cell biology of neurons."

There are approximately 1.3 million transgender adults in the US, and about 467,000 of these individuals (~36%)
are transgender men. Transgender men are individuals who were assigned female at birth but identify as male.
Trans men may transition physiologically from female to male by receiving masculinizing hormone therapy and/or
hysterectomy. Those in the trans male community participate in diverse sexual behaviors and lifestyles resulting
in unique risks to STIs, especially HIV-1. Currently, there is a significant knowledge gap of the impact of HIV-1
on trans men, including limited knowledge regarding the effects of testosterone therapy on HIV-1 susceptibility
and acquisition. Over 70% of trans men receive testosterone to promote masculine characteristics and reduce
secondary female sex characteristics. Trans men treated with testosterone report symptoms of vaginal dryness
and loss of elasticity, which increase mucosal tissue breaks, which contribute to increased risk of HIV-1
transmission in trans men. Trans men treated with testosterone for at least one year have significantly reduced
levels of Lactobacillus comprising the vaginal microbiome, which correlates with bacterial vaginosis, and thus
increased risk of HIV transmission. Like other androgens, testosterone is a steroid hormone that interacts with
many different cell types, broadly affecting both innate and adaptive immunity through its effect on toll-like
receptors, immune-response cells, and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Testosterone has broad-ranging
effects on adaptive and innate immune functions and acts in a dynamic and often antagonistic manner with other
androgens, particularly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), to modulate the development and function of immune
response cells. The central HYPOTHESIS of this research proposal is that testosterone alters cellular and
immunologic responses in the cervical mucosa that affect susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. To interrogate this
hypothesis, we propose to characterize certain cellular and innate immunologic properties of cervical mucosal
tissue obtained from transgender men receiving gender-affirming masculinizing therapy, and undergoing
medically indicated hysterectomies, and to correlate these findings to tissue susceptibility to HIV-1 infection ex
vivo. We anticipate identifying specific alterations in the cervical mucosa that correlate with testosterone therapy
and altered susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. If successful, our findings will provide new underpinnings for future
hypothesis-driven research focused on HIV-1 prevention strategies for transgender men. The research
proposed in this R21 grant application is guided by the following SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. Determine the effects of
testosterone on the susceptibility of cervical explant tissue to HIV-1 infection and populations of T lymphocytes;
and 2. Determine the effects of testosterone treatment on cytokine and chemokine expression in cervical tissue."

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity in the US,
particularly for Black women who are at greatest risk of poor outcomes. In addition to contributions to maternal
mortality, HDP increase the risk of chronic hypertension (cHTN), which can lead to cardiovascular (CV)
disease. Neighborhood greenspace has been associated with improved CV outcomes in the general
population, but few studies have evaluated the relationship between greenspace and the development of HDP
and subsequent cHTN. The broad objective of this proposal is to fill this gap by evaluating the impact of
greenspace and a greening intervention on HDP and cHTN as well as to determine the utility of
greenspace as a racial disparities mitigation tool. We will merge GeoBirth, a cohort that will include 92,000
pregnant patients in Philadelphia, PA from 2008 to 2021, with several neighborhood greenspace datasets,
including data from a randomized controlled trial of a greening intervention recently conducted by our team.
Our overarching hypothesis is that living near greenspace lowers risk of HDP and cHTN and reduces Black-
white racial disparities for these outcomes. We propose the following aims: 1) Observational: To determine if
neighborhood greenspace is associated with HDP and cHTN after pregnancy and the extent to which
greenspace mediates racial disparities in these outcomes. We will analyze associations of residential
greenspace with risk of HDP using multilevel logistic regression adjusted for individual and neighborhood-level
confounders (1a). We will determine if greenspace exposure is associated with risk of cHTN within 5 years
after pregnancy using survival analysis methods (1b). We will quantify the extent to which higher greenspace
exposure among Black women could reduce Black-white HDP and cHTN disparities using causal mediation
and interaction analyses (1c). 2) Quasi-experimental: To measure the impact of a neighborhood greening
intervention on HDP and cHTN after pregnancy, using a quasi-experimental design. We will analyze the
impact of vacant lot greening on risks of HDP and cHTN in the 5 years after pregnancy, using a difference-in-
differences analysis of women living near lots that were greened compared to control lots between 2008-2017.
3) Experimental: To examine the impact of a greening intervention on changes in blood pressure
during pregnancy, using a previously conducted RCT. We will use data from a completed cluster RCT
(2011-2014) vacant lot greening to examine the impact of greening on blood pressure changes (trajectories are
associated with development of HDP) from 20 weeks' gestation to delivery, among GeoBirth participants living
near 541 vacant lots in three trial conditions: greened lots, trash clean-up only lots, and control lots. The
proposed study will be the largest investigation into whether neighborhood greenspace can mitigate HDP risk
and cHTN risk after pregnancy and reduce racial disparities in these morbidities."

Worldwide, one in five children under five years of age manifests undernutrition as impaired linear growth, or
stunting. Stunting, defined as having a length-for-age z-score (LAZ) < -2, is associated with poor developmental
outcomes, including impaired neurodevelopment and immune responses. Furthermore, stunting and its long-
term sequelae persist across generations, contributing to an intergenerational cycle of undernutrition. Existing
nutritional interventions fail to substantially improve stunting, highlighting the need to (i) better understand other
factors contributing to stunting and (ii) focus clinical efforts towards treating maternal undernutrition in order to
break the cycle of intergenerational undernutrition. In recent years, a subclinical disorder called environmental
enteric dysfunction (EED) has been suggested to contribute to 45% of childhood stunting globally. EED is an
inflammatory enteropathy localized to the small intestine; it is characterized histologically by loss of villi and
absorptive surface area, epithelial barrier dysfunction, and an immunoinflammatory infiltrate in the lamina
propria. While the pathogenesis of EED is poorly understood, researchers have postulated a role for enteric
microorganisms. However, the small intestinal microbiota remains largely understudied, in part due to challenges
in gaining access to samples. Moreover, few experimental models of EED exist, none of which account for the
intergenerational nature of undernutrition.
I hypothesize that perturbations in the small intestinal microbiota play a causal role in the pathogenesis
of EED and consequently undernutrition that persists across generations. To test this hypothesis, the first
aim of this proposal will use gnotobiotic mice to characterize the transmissibility of enteropathy and growth
faltering by the small intestinal microbiota of Bangladeshi children and women with evidence of EED based on
histopathology of their duodenal biopsies. Collections of sequenced bacterial strains, cultured from duodenal
aspirates obtained from these stunted children and malnourished women (BMI<18.5 kg/m2) will be introduced
into young germ-free mice. I will characterize host pathology by performing immune cell profiling, protein
immunoassays, and transcriptional profiling (whole tissue and single cell). Microbial community structure will be
quantified by shotgun sequencing of community DNA, and expressed community functions by microbial RNA-
Seq. In parallel, I will establish a novel model of intergenerational undernutrition by introducing these microbia l
communities into germ-free dams and assessing the pathology in dams and their pups. The second aim will test
prevention and/or treatment of enteropathy in the gnotobiotic mouse models through introduction of duodenal
bacterial communities derived from healthy Bangladeshi women (with normal BMI). Prevention or amelioration
of enteropathy by duodenal bacterial communities from healthy women will allow further identification of taxa
that may promote or reduce pathology. These experiments will provide a pre-clinical test of the role of the small
intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of EED and could result in identification of therapeutic targets for EED."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) currently effects around 30% of Americans and costs the U.S
approximately $103 billion annually. However, the standard of care remains lifestyle changes and liver
transplantation with currently no FDA approved therapies. NAFLD often correlates with obesity which is rising
in both developed and developing nations. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) is emerging
as a central hub for carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, with its activation having been linked to NAFLD in
mice. These recent studies have highlighted a role for mTORC2 modulation during high-fat diets in mice,
where hepatic mTORC2 ablation provides a protective effect against high-fat induced hepatic steatosis.
However, the dietary supplements that have been most attributed to the rise of NAFLD in humans are
carbohydrates, specifically fructose. While protective effects of mTORC2 ablation in the liver during high-fat
diet have been investigated, its impact on high-carbohydrate diets has been neglected. Here, I will examine the
ability for mTORC2 to protect against high-carbohydrate induced hepatic steatosis, as has previously been
seen in the context of high-fat diets. Mechanistically, I will investigate the role by which hepatic mTORC2
regulates carbohydrate derived acetyl-CoA synthesis and utilization, subsequently promoting the pathogenesis
of NAFLD. I will accomplish this by examining two distinct acetyl-CoA producing enzymes: ACLY and ACSS2.
Not only will I investigate mTORC2’s role in regulating both ACLY and ACSS2 through phosphorylation, but
also for the first time, investigate mTORC2 loss in an acute setting using an auxin degron system, which is a
plant based endogenous degradation tag. With the completion of this proposed work, I strongly believe that a
more detailed and mechanistic understanding of hepatic signaling, and metabolism will be obtained, providing
targets which could ultimately be used to treat NAFLD and other metabolic diseases."

Rural dwelling adults in the US South suffer disproportionate cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden and
mortality. The Appalachia and Mississippi Delta (AMD) regions are particularly at risk, embedded in the stroke,
heart attack and heart failure (HF) mortality belts, where the determinants are multifactorial. Echocardiography
is an ideal methodology to study CVD and determine high risk imaging phenotypes for incident heart failure
owing to its ability to noninvasively assess cardiac structure and function simultaneously. Due to the excess of
CVD in the AMD region, we therefore expect a high prevalence of abnormal cardiac structure and function
among rural adults, but this has not been explicitly shown. The NHLBI-funded Risk Underlying Rural Areas
Longitudinal (RURAL) cohort study, by assessing a broad array of phenotypic, biologic and social determinants
of health represents a unique, cost-effective opportunity to implement a study to fill the gaps described, reduce
excess CVD burden and achieve health equity for all Americans. The long-term goal of this proposal is to
understand the burden of adverse cardiac remodeling in the absence of symptoms (i.e., Stage B HF) in the
AMD region and factors contributing to it so that interventions during subclinical disease states may avert
clinical HF later in life. The overall objective of this application is to establish a unique cohort, named RURAL
Echo (Echocardiographic Determinants of Cardiac Structure and Function in Rural Residents). Using the
infrastructure of the parent study’s mobile examination unit (MEU) – ‘a clinic on wheels’ – we will perform
echocardiography on all participants at baseline to characterize cardiac structure and function using a novel
artificial-intelligence (AI) echo approach. Our central hypothesis is that there is a significant burden of Stage B
HF, which is associated with exposures spanning multiple domains. We will achieve our objectives through
these specific aims: (Aim 1) Use AI Echo and meticulous core lab analysis to extensively characterize cardiac
structure and function in the RURAL study cohort with implications for public health impact of deploying AI
echo in rural settings; (Aim 2) Determine associations of AI Echo findings with known traditional biologic risk
factors and comorbidities; and (Aim 3) Determine associations of AI Echo findings with emerging social

comorbidities. The proposed study will provide the largest and most comprehensive echocardiographic dataset
focused on rural adults, and will be the first to untangle the degree and relative importance of the association
between biologic and social factors on Stage B HF among rural adults. RURAL Echo promises to yield new
knowledge on rural cardiovascular health that is highly relevant to individual and US public health."
10773515,"Project Summary. Direct exposure to sunlight subjects cells to potentially damaging
solar radiation. For superficial tissues such as the cornea, retina, and skin this is
unavoidable. Biological circadian rhythms have evolved as a way to anticipate sunlight:
by synchronizing cellular and behavioral rhythms to the 24-hour solar cycle, or
“photoentrainment”. Most tissues in mammals contain an autonomous molecular
circadian clock, and many of these are synchronized by the brain's central clock, the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). However, we have found that some tissues located
near the body's surface, such as skin and retina, have an ability to directly synchronize
their local circadian clocks to short-wavelength light using the opsin, Opn5. In the case
of retina and skin clocks, rhythmic environmental light dominates systemic circadian
synchronization cues. The central hypothesis of this work is that opsins in cells typically
exposed to sunlight respond to short-wavelength light, causing the release of diffusible
signals which synchronize adjacent circadian clocks. This allows tissues to maintain a
phase relationship with environmental light regardless of the phase of the animal's
behavior. The specific aims of this proposal are to identify the intracellular molecular
mechanism Opn5 uses to signal the presence of light using skin and retina as model
circadian systems (Aim 1), identify the nature of diffusible signaling by which Opn5-cells
influence adjacent cells and tissues (Aim 2), and determine the physiological
significance of Opn5-mediated circadian clock synchronization in vivo (Aim 3). Our
approach will be to focus on skin as a model circadian tissue due to its physiologic
significance, its natural exposure to light, and the relative ease of distinguishing Opn5-
specific photoactivation. However, studies will be repeated in retina for analyses on the
similarity of signaling mechanisms in another photoentrainable tissue. The studies will
employ a mixture of in vivo, ex vivo (organotypic tissue explants), and cell culture
methods. The innovation of this project lies in the measurement of direct responses of
clocks within mammalian tissues to environmental light and the mechanisms opsins
employ outside of the visual system. The improvements of this proposal over past work
are the 1) assessment of Opn5 signaling cascades for which there is still a gap in
published literature, 2) assessment of tissue-level signaling dynamics and 3) a focus on
the physiologic impacts of lighting environment on tissue health."
10773606,"Half of people starting antidepressant medication experience no significant improvement with the first
medication prescribed, leading either to discouragement and dropout or months of trial-and-error. More
accurately matching individuals with specific medications could significantly increase treatment success.
While selecting antidepressant medication is one of the most common clinical decisions in mental health
and general medical care, actionable evidence to guide that decision is remarkably scarce. Matching
patients with specific medications remains no better than chance. We identify three key gaps in previous
research to personalize antidepressant selection. First, previous research has not clearly distinguished
predicting overall prognosis or nonspecific response from predicting specific response to specific
medications. Second, sample sizes have typically been inadequate to accurately detect differential
treatment response. Third, previous research has focused on response to a single episode of treatment,
and that is too “noisy” a clinical phenotype to support identification of useful endophenotypes.
 We propose to address these limitations using data resources, informatics tools, and analytic
methods developed by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network (MHRN). Records databases
include comprehensive and harmonized data concerning sociodemographic characteristics, past mental
health diagnoses and treatments, comorbid mental health or substance use disorders, concomitant
treatments, dose and duration of antidepressant exposure, and structured assessment of depression
symptoms at baseline and follow-up. We will assemble a database including over 500,000
antidepressant treatment episodes for over 200,000 patients treated since 2010 in order to:
1) Rigorously test core assumptions of previous research and treatment guidelines - Heterogeneity-of-
 treatment-effects analyses will evaluate two common beliefs regarding antidepressant response:
 a. Favorable or unfavorable prior response to a single medication predicts subsequent response
 b. Prior response to a medication in a specific class predicts subsequent response to that class
2) Identify and validate decision rules to inform selection of antidepressant treatment based on patterns
of prior treatment response – Analyses will use machine learning methods (dynamic weighted
 ordinary least squares regression) to identify and validate practical decision rules for clinical practice.
3) Identify valid treatment response phenotypes to enable future research regarding genomic- or
biomarker-guided personalization – Primary analyses will use k-means clustering to identify patterns
of response across medications and medication classes. Additional analyses will explore clinical
characteristics that distinguish response phenotypes as well as order effects. Findings will inform a
next generation of research regarding genetic- and biomarker-guided antidepressant treatment."

This is an application for a K08 award for Dr. Sellers, an Instructor of Pediatrics at Stanford University School of
Medicine. Dr. Sellers is researching ion transport in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) airway and intestine and wishes to
establish himself as a young investigator in CF translational research. The K08 award for CF research on
intestinal bicarbonate secretion will provide Dr. Sellers support to achieve the following goals for his career
development: i) to establish patient derived 3-dimensional duodenal enteroids which recapitulate native CF
duodenal tissue’s bicarbonate secretory properties, ii) to gain expertise in CRISPR/Cas9 editing techniques that
can complement pharmacologic interventions to study ion transport, and iii) to gain experience in translational
investigation into identifying new therapeutic modulators of duodenal bicarbonate secretion in CF. To oversee
Dr. Sellers’ training, he will be mentored by Dr. Calvin Kuo, an established figure in in vitro organoid models. He
will also be co-mentored by Dr. Jeffrey Wine, an expert in CF ion transport. Dr. Sellers has also formed an
advisory team of Dr. Matthew Porteus, Dr. Eric Sibley, and Dr. Kim Barrett, who will complement the expertise
of Dr. Sellers, Kuo, and Wine, and provide additional expert oversight for Dr. Sellers’ proposed research. Dr.
Sellers has surrounded himself with a group of established investigators that will ensure his success.
Cystic Fibrosis is the most common, life-shortening genetic disease, affecting approximately 30,000 persons in
the U.S. and 100,000 persons worldwide. Lung failure remains the number one cause for mortality in CF,
however, patients experience significant morbidity associated with gastrointestinal manifestations and these are
known to contribute to the decline in pulmonary function. The importance of bicarbonate secretion through the
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in CF has gained traction in recent years. There
are newly developed drugs that improve CFTR expression and function, but there are no therapies aimed at
specifically improving bicarbonate secretion, and as such an important therapeutic gap exists.
To identify new ways to increase bicarbonate secretion in CF, Dr. Sellers will use developing technologies with
3-dimensional enteroid cultures and CRISPR/Cas9 editing to investigate cellular signaling pathways that
promote bicarbonate transport. This project will close the gap on establishing a human-based model for
investigating bicarbonate secretion in CF and will also utilize gene editing tools that can delineate signaling
pathways where no specific pharmacologic tools exist. It is anticipated that this research plan will not only identify
new therapeutic bicarbonate secretory pathways in CF, but together with the training plan, will enhance Dr.
Sellers’ transition to independence as a physician-scientist in CF translational research."

 Among recent breakthroughs in treating hematopoietic malignancies, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T
cell therapy is one of the most promising advances in cancer immunotherapy. However, CAR-T cells have
shown limited success targeting solid tumors. One major hurdle is the immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment of solid tumors that promotes T-cell exhaustion. Another challenge is a poor understanding
of how CAR structure impacts the signaling mechanisms driving T cell function, which has prevented the
rational design of a superior CAR therapeutic with potent anti-tumor activity and resistance to exhaustion.
 I am a Damon Runyon Cancer Research Postdoctoral fellow at UCSF. My mentor is Dr. James Wells, an
expert in chemical biology and protein engineering, and my co-mentor is Dr. Arthur Weiss, an expert in T cell
biology. Tyrosine phosphorylation is the central component of the signaling pathways of CAR-T cells but the
tools available to study pY modifications are very limited. During my postdoctoral training, I developed an
innovative and generalizable platform called “pY-Targeting by Recombinant Antibody Pairs” or “pY-TRAP” to
engineer highly specific and tight pY binding domains. This revolutionary tool is the first in vitro method for
engineering specific binders against pY-modifications in three-dimensional protein structures. It provides a
platform for developing strategies to engineer and to rewire pY-mediated signaling pathways in CAR-T cells.
 In this work, I propose to develop pY-TRAP-based strategies to address key challenges in CAR-T cell
therapies. In Aim 1, I will determine how differing CAR structure modulates the CAR interactome using a novel
pY-dependent proximity ligation approach. This work will reveal key differences in the CAR signalosome for
various CAR designs and expose the mechanisms behind their functional divergence. In Aim 2, I will establish
a screening method to determine how varying CAR structures affect the cellular response to PD-1 signaling.
This work will further unveil how to rationally engineer CAR-T cells with enhanced resistance to
immunosuppression. In Aim 3, I will engineer a synthetic PD-1 pathway in CAR-T cells designed to counteract
the original immunosuppressive function of the pathway1. This is a fundamentally different approach relative to
existing strategies to make CAR-T cells more resistant to TME-associated immunosuppressive signals. Taken
together, the studies outlined in this proposal will lead to a deeper understanding of CAR-T cell biology,
provide knowledge to inform future CAR designs, and expose new strategies to engineer and optimize
signaling outcomes in cells to advance the development of cell therapeutics.
 With the support of my mentors, collaborators, consultants and the great research environment at UCSF, I
will receive training in proteomics, quantitative data analysis, and T cell biology. These skills will help me reach
my long-term goal of becoming the head of a laboratory performing rigorous scientific research investigating
novel strategies to engineer the human immune system.

10772073,"Cutaneous melanoma is a highly aggressive tumor type with rising incidence. Despite remarkable therapeutic
advances in recent years, metastatic melanoma remains a lethal disease for thousands of patients each year,
thus new treatments are still needed. Overcoming this challenge requires deep knowledge of the underlying
biology driving and sustaining melanoma metastasis.
We are studying a novel type of RNA species, circular RNA (circRNA), which are covalently ligated RNA loops
arising from cis back-splicing. We have observed that expression of the circRNA CDR1as is lost in melanoma
cell lines and patient tissues. In primary melanoma patient tissues, loss of CDR1as strongly associates with poor
patient outcomes, suggesting its loss may be a driver of melanoma progression. Modeling CDR1as silencing,
shRNA-mediated depletion of CDR1as enhanced invasion and metastasis of melanoma cells in xenograft
models. The precise mechanism(s) by which CDR1as silencing effects a pro-tumorigenic phenotype of
melanoma cells remains undetermined. Initial publications suggested CDR1as functions as an endogenous
inhibitor of the microRNA miR-7 in neurons. Surprisingly, in melanoma, we did not observe clear regulation of
miR-7 expression or function after depletion of CDR1as, suggesting it has additional functions. We have
preliminary data supporting a role for novel CDR1as interacting proteins, including members of the IGF2BP
family, which are known to be pro-tumorigenic in a variety of cancer contexts.
Our goals with this proposal are the following: Taking a candidate approach, we plan to dissect the contribution(s)
of the IGF2BP proteins to the functional consequences of CDR1as silencing in melanoma cells. In addition, we
plan to perform a set of unbiased analyses, such as RNA-seq, RIBO-seq, RNA pull downs and proteomic
profiling, to comprehensively examine possible mechanism(s) regulated by CDR1as silencing, downstream or
independent of IGF2BPs. We will use in vitro, xenograft models and genetically engineered mouse models
(GEMMs) to elucidate the biological processes, pathways and molecules controlled by CDR1as during
melanoma progression. Our studies might uncover novel therapeutic targets or strategies to exploit for
melanoma patient treatment."
10772123,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stress is known to be a significant factor in triggering relapse, promoting heavy alcohol (ethanol) consumption,
and producing adaptations that reduce behavioral flexibility, thereby compromising control over alcohol drinking
and elevating susceptibility to relapse. Unfortunately, mechanisms and neurocircuitry underlying the complex
interaction between stress and alcohol drinking are not well understood. As part of the INIAstress Consortium,
we developed a mouse model in which repeated brief forced swim stress (FSS) exposure interacts with chronic
intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure to selectively enhance alcohol drinking in dependent (CIE-exposed) mice.
During the current funding period we established a role for the pro-stress neuropeptide dynorphin/kappa opioid
receptor (DYN/KOR) system in stress-enhanced alcohol drinking. At the same time, we used operant
conditioning procedures to demonstrate that the anti-stress neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) reduced alcohol self-
administration and stress-induced relapse-like behavior. This research project focuses on the role of DYN/KOR
and OT systems within stress-relevant circuits in models demonstrating the ability of stress to interact with
chronic alcohol in promoting escalation of alcohol drinking, enhanced relapse-like behavior, and impaired
behavioral flexibility. The project will employ two stressors (forced swim stress (FSS) and predator odor (TMT)
exposure), two models of stress-alcohol interactions (CIE-FSS Drinking and stress (TMT)-induced operant
alcohol relapse seeking/drinking), and two measures of behavioral (in)flexibility (alcohol-biased choice behavior
and persistence of alcohol drinking despite aversion). Building on our previous work demonstrating an important
role for DYN/KOR activity in the central amygdala (CeA) and pilot data showing strong DYN input to the CeA
from the insular cortex (a stress and alcohol sensitive cortical area), studies will examine the role of DYN/KOR
signaling in insular cortical (IC) projections to the CeA (IC-CeADYN pathway). Other pilot data suggest that
the stress-buffering effects of OT may be mediated by signaling in the CeA. Thus, studies will examine OT
activity in hypothalamic (PVN) projections to the CeA (PVN-CeAOT pathway). Further, studies will examine
the potential unique interactive effects of the DYN/KOR and OT systems in the PVN on behavioral
consequences of stress-alcohol interactions. The general experimental strategy will entail utilizing transgenic
mice and pharmacological, chemogenetic, and CRISPR/Cas9 approaches to target manipulation of these
neuropeptides in specific neurons within these specific neurocircuits. Collectively, these studies focus on
adaptations in pro-stress (DYN/KOR) and anti-stress (OT) systems within stress-relevant neurocircuits using
different stressors and different drinking models, thereby directly interfacing with the overall thematic framework
of the consortium. The ultimate goal is to gain new knowledge that will inform development of more effective
interventions for treating stress-related excessive alcohol drinking and relapse."

Understanding how mutations in PKD1 and TRPP2 lead to Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease
remains a major obstacle in the search for effective therapies to treat this prevalent human disease. The protein
products of these genes (PKD1 and TRPP2) form a receptor-channel complex for which the activation
mechanism remains unknown. For this reason, investigations targeting the downstream effects of dysfunctional
complexes continue to pose a challenge. TRPP2 functions as a nonselective cation channel yet the functions
ascribed to PKD1 and to PKD1/TRPP2 as a complex are incompletely understood in an integrated or disease-
relevant perspective. PKD1 has been shown to form an ion channel subunit in the 1:3 PKD1/TRPP2 complex,
and independently has been proposed to act as an atypical G protein-coupled receptor. WNT ligands have
recently been shown to activate the PKD1/TRPP2 complex leading to TRPP2-mediated currents. This finding
presents a novel opportunity to investigate the mechanism of PKD1/TRPP2 activation and the role of PKD1. The
objective of the proposed research is to resolve the WNT-induced activation mechanism of the PKD1/TRPP2
complex. This objective will be attained by testing the hypothesis that WNT binding to PKD1 leads to the
downstream activation of TRPP2 via intermediary G protein signaling. The rationale is that information from
these studies will yield insight into PKD1/TRPP2 function and regulation. This knowledge will drive future
investigations to determine how mutations that compromise function can lead to cystic kidney disease. To test
the hypothesis, the following three specific aims will be pursued. Aim 1 will test if WNT binding to PKD1 is
necessary and sufficient for PKD1/TRPP2 channel activation. Residues within the minimal WNT binding domain
of PKD1 that are necessary for the interaction with WNT will be identified using pull-down and in situ binding
assays. Patch clamp techniques will then be used to determine if mutations that disrupt WNT binding
subsequently disrupt WNT-induced channel activation. Aim 2 will investigate the role of WNT in the function of
PKD1 as an atypical G protein-coupled receptor. This will be accomplished using NanoBRET assays to
determine whether WNT ligands induce PKD1-mediated G protein signaling and if WNT binding to PKD1 induces
PKD1 receptor desensitization. Aim 3 will determine the role of PKD1-mediated G protein signaling in TRPP2
activation. This will be achieved using NanoBRET and patch clamp to test if loss of PKD1-mediated G protein
signaling disrupts channel activation, investigate the association of G proteins with TRPP2, and determine if
inhibition of G protein signaling prevents WNT-induced TRPP2 activity. Proposed studies will provide a unique
training opportunity in biochemistry, molecular biology, GPCR and ion channel function, in the context of one of
the most common genetic diseases. The successful completion of this proposal will yield a defined model for
WNT-induced activation of the PKD1/TRPP2 complex to direct future functional analyses targeting ADPKD
pathogenesis."

Background and long-term objectives: Children and young adults with diffuse midline glioma (DMG)
harboring H3K27M mutation rarely survive longer than two years and have no proven therapies beyond
radiation. The dopamine receptor DRD2 antagonist ONC201 induces transcription of TNF-related apoptosis-
inducing ligand (TRAIL), leading to apoptosis in multiple tumor cell types. ONC201 additionally binds and
activates the mitochondrial protease ClpP, resulting in mitochondrial-mediated cell death in breast cancer cells
with active oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). ONC201 is in early phase use in H3K27M-DMG, but its
mechanism and efficacy remains unknown. In our preliminary data, ONC201 is effective in murine H3 K27M-
mutant gliomas. In our unpublished clinical data (n=50 H3K27M patients), ONC201 doubles PFS and overall
survival (OS) in some clinical sub-groups (e.g. thalamic H3K27M) with multiple sustained responses. Despite
this impressive efficacy in H3K27M-DMG, we do not know how ONC201 works in H3K27M-DMG tumor cells or
how to improve responses in resistant tumors.
 In analysis of tumor sequencing, ONC201 resistance correlates with high expression of EGFR and the
brain developmental transcription factor FOXG1. FOXG1 expression is also the strongest negative predictor of
ONC201 sensitivity in human glioma cell lines. In order to prioritize which patients should be treated with
ONC201 and to generate rationale combination therapies, there is a critical need to elucidate the mechanism
of ONC201 sensitivity in H3K27M cells. Our central hypothesis is that ONC201 is effective in H3K27M-DMG
tumors with active OXPHOS through targeting of ClpP and that EGFR signaling mediates ONC201 resistance
by inactivating OXPHOS via FOXG1. This is based on our preliminary data in K27M-DMG cells, which shows
that cells cultured in media that promotes OXPHOS have an improved response to ONC201, and (iii) EGFR
knockdown reduces FOXG1 genomic binding and improves ONC201 response.
Approach: In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the impact of: (i) ClpP mitochondrial targeting vs. DRD2
antagonism and (ii) glycolysis vs OXPHOS, in the sensitivity of H3K27M-DMG cells to ONC201. In Specific Aim
2, we will determine the role of FOXG1 in H3K27M-DMG bioenergetics. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine the
ability of EGFR inhibition to impact ONC201-induced mitochondrial stress in H3K27M-DMG and for baseline
EGFR/FOXG1 tumor staining to predict ONC201 response. We expect to define the mechanism by which EGFR
and FOXG1 impact mitochondrial bioenergetics and ONC201 sensitivity in H3K27M-DMG tumors.
Significance: This contribution is expected to be significant because it will allow clinicians to prioritize which
H3K27M-DMG patients should be treated with ONC201 and provide a platform for rationale combinatorial
treatments to improve ONC201 resistance. Our translational team will soon open a multi-site international
platform trial that can implement the results of this proposal immediately for patients with H3K27M-DMG."

from 7 graduate programs and departments across Georgetown to develop a cadre of diverse and
interdisciplinary scholars for careers in the biomedical scientific workforce. The overarching program goals are
to expand diversity of our PhD student population, build a community of interdisciplinary scholars, facilitate career
self-efficacy, and establish a community of practice in inclusive mentorship. Each year, six IMSD Trainees will
enter the program and be supported for years 1 and 2. Year 1 will consist of foundational coursework in their
respective disciplines with access to interdepartmental electives, cohort development activities, and research
rotations. All IMSD Trainees will complete a core Survival Skills course that focuses on scientific rigor, science
communications, proposal development, and responsible conduct of research. Scholars will also complete a
course in Celebrating Difference that helps them navigate institutional cultures, develop leadership skills, and
synergize their sociocultural and science identities. During year two, trainees will join thesis research laboratories
and form cross-disciplinary mentorship teams tailored to their individualized interests and career development
needs. The mentoring team structure will broaden the trainee’s scientific skills and career perspectives, as well
as foster cross-departmental scholarship. Additionally, IMSD Scholars will develop cross-sector professional
management and communications skills by completing project management and communications curriculum.
Scholars will also complete experiential immersion projects with administrative partners on campus or with offsite
partners in industry or policy sectors. Participating faculty will complete training in effective and inclusive
mentoring practices using the Entering Mentoring Train the Trainer curriculum that we’ve previously replicated
at Georgetown University. To integrate our faculty into the IMSD recruitment process, we will partner with the
University of the District of Columbia (UDC), a Historically Black College and University, to provide paid summer

Recently, the development of MR-LINACs has made high-quality online adaptative radiotherapy a clinical
reality to account for the daily anatomical variations to preserve the treatment quality. MR-LINACs, combining
modern radiotherapy linear accelerators (LINACs) with on-board magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), offer
excellent soft-tissue contrast to allow accurate organ and tumor segmentation to precisely capture the daily
anatomical changes of each patient. Coupled with advanced adaptive treatment planning systems, MR-LINAC
is the ideal platform for online adaptive radiotherapy and will bring cancer radiotherapy to a new level of
precision and personalization. However, this new format of radiotherapy also comes with new challenges for
patient safety and plan quality checks that cannot be satisfactorily addressed with traditional quality assurance
(QA) tools: 1) With the patient lying on the treatment couch waiting for the treatment to start, there is mounting
pressure on the team to move through the workflow as fast as possible, which may increase the likelihood of
making mistakes and thus an effective QA procedure is even more important. 2) Each adapted plan warrants a
new QA process, adding substantial burdens to an already extremely time-constrained process. A QA process
with high efficiency is needed. 3) Conventional QA procedures are quite complex, involving inputs from many
stakeholders, and thus are human-power demanding and error-prone. An automatic QA procedure requiring
minimal human interventions and communications is highly desired. 4) In addition to checking the quality of the
adapted segmentation and treatment plan, it is also crucial for a QA procedure to ensure their consistency with
the physician’s intentions/preferences in the original plan. 5) A QA tool that is able to predict the plan
deliverability prior to treatments, without actually irradiating the patients, is needed for online adaptive
radiotherapy. The overarching goal of this project is to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based QA system
to address these urgent unmet clinical needs for MR-LINAC online adaptive radiotherapy, with four main
components to: 1) intelligently assess the quality of the adapted target and organ-at-risk segmentations and
their consistency with those in the original plan; 2) intelligently assess the quality of the adapted plan and its
consistency with the original plan; 3) efficiently perform 2nd dose check with an AI-based near real-time
independent dose engine; and 4) predict the measurement-based QA results of plan deliverability using prior
knowledge and new adapted plan information. We have two Specific Aims: 1) System development, including
data acquisition for AI model training, and development of four AI models; and 2) System translation and
validation at multiple institutions, including developing transfer learning algorithm and package for automated
model commissioning; and translation, fine-tuning and evaluation of the developed AI systems. The successful
conduct of the proposed project will result in the first intelligent, efficient, reliable, and independent QA system
to facilitate unleashing the full potential of MR-LINAC online adaptive radiotherapy to advance cancer care."

 This proposal centers on uncovering intrinsic physical properties of DNA duplex (i.e., DNA shape) and
elucidating their roles in CRSIPR Cas9 and Cas12a target discrimination. CRISPR (Clustered-Regularly-
Interspaced-Short-Palindromic-Repeats) systems have been adapted into versatile and programmable agents
for manipulating nucleic acid targets in a genome-wide fashion, unleashing a revolution in genome editing and
manipulation that is still rapidly advancing. CRISPR-based technology is built upon specific recognition of nucleic
acids, and a major obstacle hampering its applications in therapeutic settings is the “off-target effect”, in which
uncontrolled and undesired actions of CRISPR on aberrant gene targets result in deleterious consequences.
Significant improvement of CRISPR specificity is required, and this depends on further in-depth understanding
of mechanism of CRISPR target discrimination.
 Proposed work focuses on Cas9 and Cas12a that are most widely used for engineering DNA genomes. Cas9
and Cas12a both use an effector protein-RNA complex to cleave double-stranded DNAs, and select their
cognate targets based on: (i) base-pairing between the RNA guide and a segment of the DNA target-strand
designated as protospacer and (ii) a short protospacer-adjacent-motif (PAM) within the target DNA. Ca9/Cas12a
target discrimination rely on intrinsic DNA shape, which is determined collectively by the local “core” base-pair(s)
and many other factors including (distal) peripheral sequences and topological constraints (e.g., supercoiling).
However, current studies on Cas9/Cas12a target selection focus on DNA features at the core segment spanning
the PAM and protospacer, and have not yet accounted for impacts of peripheral sequences beyond direct
RNA/DNA pairing or DNA topological constraints.
 We have developed unique site-directed spin labeling methods to obtain sequence-dependent conformation
(shape) of free duplexes as well as DNAs bound by proteins including Cas9 and Cas12a. Our recent work shows
that DNA sequences not involved in RNA/DNA pairing can modulate Cas9-induced DNA unwinding and cleavage,
and the information enables gene editing in cells with short RNA guides that are known to enhance specificity.
Building on these findings, we will investigate how DNA peripheral sequences and supercoiling modulate
Cas9/Cas12a target discrimination as well as affect the shape of free DNA core segments. Information learned
will be incorporated into algorithms for enhancing CRISPR targeting specificity, as well as for predicting three-
dimensional DNA shape from the linear one-dimensional sequence in a genome-wide setting. The project will
advance understanding on DNA specific recognition that is fundamental to biology, and will contribute to
development of the next generation of scientific workforce."
10772139,"Project Summary/Abstract
Although many human cancers share similar metabolic alterations, including the Warburg effect, it remains
unclear whether oncogene-specific metabolic alterations are required for tumor development. We identified
phospholipase A2G7 (PLA2G7) as a “synthetic lethal” partner of Nras Q61K/R mutants in melanoma cells, which
is selectively important for cell proliferation and tumor growth potential of melanoma cells expressing mutant
Nras, but not in cells expressing BRAF V600E. PLA2G7 (a.k.a. platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase
(PAF-AH)) is a secreted enzyme produced by leukocytes including macrophages, T cells, and mast cells, which
catalyzes the degradation of phospholipid platelet activating factor (PAF) and production of a biologically inactive
phospholipid product Lyso-PAF, blocking PAF-induced inflammation and vascular permeability. Mechanistically,
we found a surprising intracellular signaling function of PLA2G7. Knockdown of PLA2G7 results in decreased
S338 phosphorylation of Raf-1 in cells, which is crucial for Raf-1 activation and consequently essential for mutant
Nras-dependent MAPK activation, but dispensable for MAPK activation by BRAF V600E, which bypasses Raf-1.
This explains the selective importance of PLA2G7 only in mutant Nras-expressing cells. Moreover, Lyso-PAF, a
biological inactive form of PAF that has been suggested to be “functionless”, may contribute to p21-activated
kinase 2 (PAK2)-dependent S338 phosphorylation of Raf-1, through direct binding to PAK2, likely in the catalytic
cleft, leading to enhanced PAK2 kinase activity by stabilizing ATP binding. Thus, we hypothesize that
“functionless” Lyso-PAF has an intracellular and signaling role that is selectively important for mutant Nras
transformation by contributing to PAK2-dependent S338 phosphorylation of Raf-1, and PLA2G7 represents an
alternative therapeutic target to selectively treat melanoma cells expressing mutant Nras. We have identified and
validated a compound Succimer as a selective and potent PLA2G7 inhibitor. Three specific aims are proposed:
(1) To determine the selective importance of the PLA2G7-Lyso-PAF axis in the proliferative and tumor growth
potential of melanoma cells expressing mutant Nras, which is “bypassed” in cells expressing BRAF V600E, using
diverse human melanoma cell lines and “isogenic” cell line pairs. (2) To explore the molecular and structural
mechanisms by which Lyso-PAF contributes to PAK2-Raf-1 axis through directly binding to PAK2 catalytic cleft
and consequently stabilizing ATP binding. (3) To evaluate PLA2G7 as an alternative target to selectively
attenuate proliferative and tumor growth potential of mutant Nras-expressing melanoma cells in vitro, and in
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of melanoma in vivo, respectively, using our newly identified PLA2G7
inhibitor, Succimer, and elucidate the underlying structural mechanism for further structure-activation
relationship (SAR) studies."

Manipulation of complex objects or tool use is a hallmark of daily living, and loss of manual dexterity due to motor
impairments lead to loss of independence. Manipulating objects is particularly challenging when the object has
internal dynamics that is not directly controlled. Even the seemingly simple task of transporting a cup of coffee
has intrinsic dynamics that humans need to predict, preempt, and compensate for to avoid spilling. Control of
such complex nonlinear systems with online error corrections based on precise internal models appears
daunting, given the slow neural processes and the ubiquitous noise in the sensorimotor system. Hence, this
research tests the hypothesis that humans learn to simplify the object interactions, i.e., make the interactions
predictable. The task of carrying a cup of coffee is modeled with a cart-and-pendulum system that is rendered
in a virtual environment and subjects interact with the virtual cup via a robotic manipulandum. To gain insight
into human control strategies, this proposal develops a task-dynamic approach that affords principled
hypothesis-testing by parsing the complex dynamics into execution and result variables, with minimal
assumptions about the human controller. Eight experiments test the overall hypothesis that humans seek
solutions that are predictable, by correlating hand-object motions, and making the behavior stable and tolerant
to error and risk to obviate error corrections and prevent failure. Aim-1 tests control of internal dynamics in linear
movements and examines how humans choose initial conditions to mitigate perturbations, how they preempt
undesired ball oscillations, how they exploit intermittent contact to develop a stable rhythm, and how they modify
the object properties to facilitate stable contact behavior. To examine learning, Aim-2 scales up the
dimensionality of the task by introducing more real-life planar cup movements, which creates an exponential
increase in complexity. Four experiments test task goals that introduce new dynamic challenges, such as
combination of rhythmic and discrete movements, complex ball dynamics when changing movement directions,
adaptation and modification of object properties, all to show how humans either exploit or override internal
dynamics to achieve predictability. Aim-3 introduces a real version of the task with a custom-designed device,
the MAGIC Table. Following a comparison of the real and virtual set-ups, the MAGIC Table is used to leverage
the theoretical framework to create novel sensitive metrics to quantify motor function for clinical applications.
Specifically, we assess severity and recovery of motor impairment in a cohort of patients after stroke. As manual
dexterity is compromised in many individuals with neurological disorders, the experimental paradigm and its
quantitative analyses promise to become a useful platform to gain insights into neurological diseases."
10772143,"SUMMARY
Stress is a well-known factor in promoting heavy drinking and relapse to drinking in individuals with alcohol use
disorder (AUD), and avoidance of the negative affective symptoms of ethanol withdrawal (e.g. anxiety and
depression) is also believed to play a critical role in relapse. Further, disorders of negative affect may
predispose individuals to AUD and the interaction of these disorders may exacerbate symptoms of both. One
component of the brain stress system is comprised of the neuropeptide dynorphin and its target, the kappa
opioid receptors (KOR), and it is augmented following exposure to chronic alcohol and/or stress. We will use a
mouse model of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure combined with either chronic forced swim stress or
mouse single prolonged stress to understand the role that KORs play in the maladaptive neurobiological
changes induced by stress/ethanol interactions. Our previous work revealed that the function of the
dynorphin/KOR system in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was robustly up-regulated by chronic ethanol
exposure and withdrawal in a time/exposure dependent manner in both the CIE model in mice and in a long-
term voluntary ethanol drinking model in monkeys. In addition, in mice we found that systemic administration of
a KOR antagonist reduced anxiety/compulsive behaviors (marble burying) and withdrawal-induced excessive
drinking. Dopamine (DA) is involved in negative affective responses to stress, and DA terminals are known
targets of KOR activity. Therefore, we will use a multipronged approach to examine KOR regulation of DA
signaling in the NAc, which regulates motivation to drink alcohol, and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), which
regulates stress/anxiety-related behaviors, using conditional viral knockdown of KORs from these regions,
microdialysis to assess basal dopamine and dynorphin levels following exposure to CIE and/or stress
paradigms, and the fluorescent sensor dLight to query real-time dopamine signaling in these animals in
response to time-locked behaviors. The overall goal of this proposal is to define the role of KORs on DA
signaling in the NAc and BLA following exposure to chronic alcohol and/or stress, and how these adaptations
in stress-responsive limbic circuitry nodes that are responsible for withdrawal-associated negative affect can
be targeted for the treatment of AUD."
10772044,"Project Summary/Abstract
In normal physiology, the repertoire of human T cells includes a 10% subpopulation that expresses two, rather
than a single, T cell receptor (TCR). Despite the obvious implications of dual-specificity at the clonal level, the
function of this dual TCR subpopulation remains largely unknown. We recently proposed the novel paradigm
and provided evidence demonstrating that naturally-arising dual TCR expression is important in thymopoiesis
and that dual TCR cells have exceptional ability to recognize ligands driving alloreactivity and autoreactivity. This
reactivity is relevant to disease, as we demonstrated in mouse models and human patients that dual TCR T cells
are important drivers in graft versus host disease, a severe and life-threatening T cell-mediated complication of
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Data from other models also link dual TCR T cells to autoimmune
disease such as diabetes. Despite evidence of the importance of dual TCR cells, they have been understudied
due to the inability to definitively identify, isolate, and functionally study T cells expressing dual TCRs. To address
this, we have developed novel approaches including single-cell TCR sequencing of mouse and human cells, and
transgenic mice with fluorescent reporters for TCRα. We intend that these tools will enable us to address our
hypotheses and generate novel insights into fundamental TCR biology to identify potential avenues to improve
clinical transplantation."
10770127,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Substance abuse disorders including opioid dependence are characterized by brain oxidative stress and neu-
roinflammation. In addition to dopamine autooxidation, chronic drug consumption increases the expression of
pro-oxidant enzymes such as NADPH-oxidase (NOX), leading to excessive production of reactive oxygen spe-
cies (ROS) primarily in the form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Endogenous H2O2 can transiently and/or irreversibly
oxidize cysteinyl residues depending upon its concentration and duration of exposure. In proteins, H2O2 reacts
with redox-sensitive cysteine thiols to form sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH). Cysteine S-sulfenation has emerged as a
major post-translational modification that exerts significant effects on protein function, analogous to phosphory-
lation. A small but compelling literature suggests that changes in cysteine redox state affect mu opioid receptor
(MOR) function, as thiol alkylation, site-directed mutagenesis, and redox-modulating agents can alter ligand
binding and downstream signaling events. In addition to structural and regulatory roles, oxidation of the cysteine
thiol blocks the reaction of this residue with a,b-unsaturated carbonyls and alkyl halides, significantly limiting the
utility of conventional electrophile-fragment screening as a tool for covalent ligand discovery. To address this
issue, we have recently developed a strategy that employs nucleophilic covalent fragments to target S-sulfenated
(oxidized) cysteines. These sulfenic acid-reactive activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) probes have been cou-
pled with state-of-the-art quantitative proteomics to identify S-sulfenated cysteines in human cells, which presage
the development of covalent fragments therapeutically targeting redox-active cysteines. Here, the following Spe-
cific Aims are proposed: 1) Increase the size and structural diversity of our nucleophile-fragment libraries; 2) Map
cysteine redox reactivity changes and S-sulfenated (oxidized) cysteine ligandability in differentiated mature SH-
SY5Y neurons that are unstimulated (control) or treated with morphine agonist (stimulated). These studies are
rationalized based on proof-of-concept experiments which demonstrate that unique ligandable sites are identified
when fragments are functionalized with nucleophilic reactive groups that react with S-sulfenated (oxidized) cys-
teine residues. Deliverables from these studies are a novel chemoproteomic method, chemical matter that can
be mined as a source of small-molecule probes and as starting points for drug discovery."

10764864,"Abstract
After several decades of substantial investment in antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), the field has dramatically
expanded with the FDA approval of seven new agents in the past four years including five ADCs against solid
tumors. This recent success has reignited interest in the field, yet despite these approvals, fundamental
questions as to how these agents work in the clinic remain. One of the most important unanswered questions is
the role of the immune system in therapeutic responses to ADCs. This is a complex question given the multiple
ways in which ADCs can interact with the immune system. First, ADC payloads can drive immunogenic cell
death (ICD), which can stimulate immune cells via damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Second,
the payloads can have direct effects on immune cells following bystander uptake of payloads or Fc-gamma
receptor mediated uptake. Finally, current ADCs in solid tumors use an IgG1 framework, where the antibodies
themselves are capable of Fc-effector functions that may also contribute to efficacy. The relative magnitude of
these effects is unknown, and until this question is answered, the most effective design of ADCs for cancer and
other diseases remains unclear. For example, these results determine what protein format will be most effective
and how different protein domains can be engineered to enhance efficacy. It also highlights what therapies will
synergize with ADCs to enhance a durable immune response. The long-term goal of this research is to
understand the fundamental properties of these complex drugs in sufficient detail to rationally combine the
antibody, linker, and payload with a particular target (in a select patient population) for maximum clinical efficacy
in both cancer and non-oncologic applications. The goal for this proposal is to quantify the relative contributions
of direct payload cell killing, indirect immune stimulation from ICD, and Fc-gamma receptor mediated signaling
and payload uptake in driving a strong immune response to ADC therapy in immunocompetent mouse models.
By using antibody ‘carrier’ doses in combination with ADCs and manipulating which species can bind Fc-gamma
receptors, these studies will dissect the relative contributions from each mechanism. Quantitative single-cell
pharmacokinetic measurements are also used to independently measure payload efficacy in cancer and immune
cell populations. The results are combined with hybrid agent-based computational models to rapidly simulate
thousands of permutations for predictive insight into the role of each mechanism in animal models and scaling
to the clinic. A graphical user interface can allow other scientists to make falsifiable predictions about their own
ADCs to guide the development of ADC therapeutics against any target of interest. These targets/payloads
include non-oncological applications, such as immunosuppressive ADCs and depletion of select cell populations
in the body. The successful completion of this work will enable accurate predictions of promising ADC designs
to focus preclinical development and forecast clinical effectiveness. Together, these quantitative mechanistic
studies and predictive computational methods will permit the rapid and efficient development of novel ADCs."
10765061,"Abstract: Research in my laboratory has centered on the development and application of multi-disciplinary
approaches to study signal transduction pathways important in normal physiology and, when de-regulated,
contribute to a number of diseases. This began with our discovery and cloning of a novel signaling partner for
the epidermal growth factor receptor, the human Cdc42 protein, a small GTPase highly conserved from yeast to
humans, and continued with the identification of many Cdc42 regulatory proteins and signaling targets. The
conservation of Cdc42 throughout evolution accounts for the many fundamentally important roles it plays in cell
biology and organism development, including the regulation of cell growth and migration, and the establishment
of cellular polarity. We then discovered an unanticipated but highly significant function of Cdc42 in directing the
upregulation of glutamine metabolism and metabolic activities that generate building blocks for biosynthetic
processes required in a wide range of cellular functions. This also provides a mechanism for connecting the
various intracellular processes regulated by Cdc42 to the surrounding environment by directing the biogenesis
of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which have been implicated by our laboratory and others in mediating intercellular
communication across the evolutionary spectrum from bacteria to higher organisms. Recently, we found that
Cdc42 activates these metabolic activities through the assembly of large protein complexes. Understanding how
these metabolic/signaling nodes are assembled holds important clues to their regulation and function, as well as
sheds light on a long-standing question of how Cdc42 activates a critically important protein kinase, mTOR
(mechanistic Target of Rapamycin), which is a necessary step for cap-dependent mRNA splicing, the neuronal
differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and the survival of cancer cells under stressful conditions.
Elucidating the biochemical and structural features of these large complexes that activate glutamine metabolism
and mTOR, which are essential for cell growth and survival, and helping to move forward the field of EVs
represent major research goals for our laboratory in the next 5 years. Key gaps in our knowledge surrounding
these broad areas of study will be addressed. We want to understand how Cdc42 directs the formation of
metabolic/signaling nodes that not only play such important roles in cell biology but also have significant
implications for disease, define the mechanisms responsible for their regulation, and determine their 3D
structures. We also will set out to address challenging questions to further the development of the EV field, by
identifying the biochemical determinants and signaling cues that dictate the loading of essential EV cargo and
determining the structural features of EVs that enable their various biological functions. To achieve these goals,
we will leverage our expertise in signal transduction and benefit from a strong group of collaborators."
10767084,"PPG PROJECT 1 SUMMARY
H. pylori is the strongest risk factor for gastric cancer. One microbial determinant that augments cancer risk is the
cag type IV secretion system (T4SS) which exports an oncoprotein, CagA, into epithelial cells. Dietary factors
also modify cancer risk and we have shown with Projects 2 and 3 and Cores A and B that iron depletion
enhances the ability of H. pylori to induce carcinogenesis in transgenic INS-GAS mice and Mongolian gerbils.
Metabolomics studies with Core B subsequently identified increased gastric mucosal levels of the secondary
carcinogenic bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA) only among H. pylori-infected iron-depleted mice. These discovery-
driven results informed provocative in vivo intervention studies with Project 2 and Core A demonstrating that
DCA accelerates H. pylori-induced carcinogenesis. Mechanistically, our groups have shown that DCA 1) endows
H. pylori with an enhanced capacity to translocate CagA, 2) induces gastric epithelial expression of
proinflammatory chemokines, 3) activates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and 4) induces epithelial
proliferation. With Projects 2, 3, and Core A, we also demonstrated that iron deficiency enhances H. pylori
colonization within gastric stem cell niches, suggesting that aberrant signaling within a susceptible stem cell
population may lower the threshold for carcinogenesis. Long-lived gastric epithelial stem cells are marked by
Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (Lrig1) and, pertinent to this application, we have 1)
used lineage tracing to demonstrate that cag+ strains selectively activate Lrig1 in vivo, leading to the development
of premalignant lesions, and 2) developed primary gastric organoid models to show that H. pylori-induced Lrig1
expression is partially dependent on EGFR activation. Finally, we have full access to a unique prospective cohort
in Colombia where gastric adenocarcinoma and H. pylori infections are endemic. Full clinical, endoscopic, and
histologic data are available at baseline and at each interval follow-up out to 26 years, including frozen gastric
tissue from the 20- and 26- year timepoints from persons who either progressed histologically or remained
stable, providing a unique opportunity to define disease mechanisms. Our hypothesis is that effectors such as
DCA synthesized under iron-deficient conditions promote oncogenic interactions between H. pylori cag+
strains and Lrig1 stem cells that contribute to augmentation in gastric cancer risk. Our Aims are to:
1. Define effects of DCA on Lrig1 pathobiology within the context of H. pylori-induced carcinogenesis in vivo
2. Use primary multicellular systems to mechanistically study effects of DCA on Lrig1-driven phenotypes in
 conjunction with human validation
3. Define effects of DCA on H. pylori microbial function that influence carcinogenesis"
10767085,"PPG PROJECT 2 SUMMARY
H. pylori is the strongest risk factor for gastric cancer, the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths, and >50% of
humans harbor this infection. With the other PPG Projects and Cores, new insights into gastric carcinogenesis
from Project 2 during the current award period included a deeper understanding of the role of polyamines in
epithelial dysfunction and immunoregulation, altered immune cell remodeling/metabolism, and implication of
electrophiles in gastric cancer. By elucidating mechanisms of carcinogenesis, we will now address our goal of
new interventions for cancer prevention and treatment. We have demonstrated the essential role of spermine
oxidase (SMOX) in H. pylori-induced carcinogenesis. We have new evidence that this occurs independently of
the conversion of spermine to spermidine, and is likely due to acrolein and H2O2, also products of SMOX activity.
Acrolein is a highly reactive aldehyde and electrophile, which exhibits a half-life far longer than transient reactive
oxygen species. Acrolein and H2O2 support lipid peroxidation, enhancing generation of other potent dicarbonyl
hese strong oxidants form irreversible adducts with proteins and DNA, leading to changes in cell
signaling, somatic genomic abnormalities, and epigenetic changes, but their role

Linking SMOX-derived electrophiles to gastric cancer is a new concept.
patient-derived gastric organoids 2-
hydroxybenzylamine (2-HOBA) is a scavenger of reactive electrophiles that prevents adduct formation with
macromolecules. We reported that an analog of 2-HOBA
reduced somatic genomic abnormalities and prevented
cancer development in rodents infected with H. pylori. We will now focus on
2-HOBA itself, because: 1) it is a
natural product that is not toxic or mutagenic; 2) Phase 1 clinical trials at VUMC have demonstrated its safety;
3) we have shown that 2-HOBA prevents H. pylori gastritis and carcinogenesis in INS-GAS mice, and restricts
growth of tumor xenografts; and 4) we have a partnership with MTI Biotech for use of 2-HOBA. Our hypothesis
is that reactive aldehydes derived from SMOX activity are major contributors to gastric carcinogenesis and tumor
growth and are a therapeutic target for both cancer prevention and treatment. Through the strong integration in
this PPG we will address our Aims, which are to determine: 1) if effects of SMOX in gastric carcinogenesis are
mediated by electrophiles in vivo; we will use cancer prone INS-GAS mice +/- Smox deletion and +/- 2-HOBA
treatment, and study cancer development and its mechanisms; 2) effects of SMOX-derived reactive aldehydes
in human gastric organoids, assessing carcinogenic signaling and effects on the transcriptome/proteome and on
H. pylori; 3) if electrophiles are a therapeutic target for gastric cancer development, by investigating human
tissues along the cascade from gastritis to cancer and in disease progressors vs. non-progressors, and in human
cancer xenografts in immunodeficient mice. Our studies are expected to lead to new approaches to gastric
cancer prevention and treatment, and directly to clinical trials."
10767086,"PPG PROJECT 3 SUMMARY
Persistent colonization of the human stomach with the Gram-negative bacterium Helicobacter pylori is
associated with a markedly increased risk for the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. Gastric cancer is the
fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and H. pylori has been classified as a type I carcinogen
by the World Health Organization. The long-term goal of this work is to define the mechanisms by which H.
pylori infection can lead to gastric cancer, and to develop improved approaches for identifying individuals who
have an increased risk for gastric cancer so they can be targeted for therapeutic intervention. Our previous
studies have shown that both a high-salt diet and a low-iron diet increase the risk of gastric cancer in an animal
model of H. pylori infection. High-salt- or low-iron-induced alterations in H. pylori gene expression likely account
at least in part for the detrimental effects of these diets on gastric cancer risk. With Project 1 and Core A, we
have shown that high-salt and low-iron diets also influence the evolution of H. pylori in the stomach, selecting for
mutations that confer a survival advantage in a carcinogenic environment and potentially leading to enhanced
oncogenic potential. One such mutation encodes an amino acid substitution near the metal-binding site of Fur,
a regulatory protein that controls genes involved in iron homeostasis. The overarching hypothesis of this
proposal is that gastric cancer risk is influenced by both strain-specific H. pylori genetic features and
dietary composition. The three interrelated Specific Aims are to (i) define interrelated effects of salt and iron
on H. pylori gene expression, physiology, and fitness; (ii) elucidate interrelated effects of fur sequence variation,
dietary salt, and dietary iron on H. pylori-induced gastric pathology and gastric cancer risk; and (iii) identify
molecular alterations linked to gastric preneoplastic and neoplastic pathology. These Aims will interdigitate with
work proposed in Projects 1 and 2 and will utilize Gastric Histopathology Core A, Proteomics and
Metabolomics Core B, as well as Administrative Core C for biostatistical support. These studies will lead to
important advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which H. pylori infection, high-salt
diets, and low-iron diets promote the development of gastric cancer. Ultimately, these studies should lead to
advances in the prevention and therapy of malignancies that develop in the setting of chronic inflammation."

The primary mission of the Gastric Histopathology Core is to provide all Projects with high-quality
histopathologic characterization and quality assurance of tissues from rodent models of gastric inflammation and
neoplasia, immunohistochemistry (IHC) services with expert interpretation by experienced gastrointestinal
pathologists, access to human gastric tissues and tissue microarray services, quantitative analysis of histologic,
immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining of tissue sections and tissue microarrays, and large-
scale digital archiving through collaboration with Dr. M. Blanca Piazuelo and Dr. Kay Washington. The following
services are proposed:
1. To provide expert evaluation of histopathology of rodent models of H. pylori-induced gastric neoplasia and
 correlation with human disease.
2. To provide priority access to custom high-quality, cost-effective research histology services, including
 immunohistochemistry, multiplex immunostaining, and digital histomorphology.
3. To provide custom tissue microarray services and access to human gastric tissue samples with pathologic
 annotation and clinical outcome.
The three component Projects and Core B (Proteomics and Metabolomics Core) of this Program Project
Grant all rely heavily upon morphologic analysis of gastric tissues isolated from rodent models of Helicobacter
pylori-induced gastritis and gastric neoplasia. Dr. Piazuelo’s and Dr. Washington’s high level of expertise in
interpretation of histopathologic changes in rodent models and in human tissues, as well as in interpretation of
immunohistochemical studies, will be critical to this work, and these collaborative activities are currently not
funded through existing resources. By utilizing the resources of a GI research-related immunohistochemistry
facility, it will be possible to achieve high standards for all histologic studies proposed in this grant. This
centralization of histologic services under the supervision of experienced pathologists with a dedicated interest
in gastrointestinal pathology will also allow careful attention to quality assurance. In addition, the access to
human gastric tissues allows each Project the ability to quickly translate findings in H. pylori-infected rodent
models of gastric inflammation and cancer to human disease along the cascade from non-atrophic gastritis to
intestinal metaplasia, and cancer. Core A will continue to collaborate with Core B by coordinating tissue
annotation for imaging mass spectrometry. Core A will also work synergistically with Core B by using IHC to
localize protein targets and validate expression changes identified by proteomics analysis and enzymes
implicated by metabolomics studies."

experiments are available for the proposed analyses. In addition, advanced methods are available including:
multidimensional LC-MS/MS for protein identification from complex samples, data-independent acquisition (DIA)
for greater proteome coverage, and high spatial and mass resolution imaging methods for tissue analysis with
tissue annotation coordinated with Gastric Histopathology Core A. Conversely, Core A will synergize with
Core B by using immunohistochemistry to localize protein targets identified by proteomics analysis. Core B also
provides relative quantitation using stable isotope differential labeling strategies, such as TMT, for samples
derived from animal models, including organoids. Validation of protein expression or metabolite abundance
changes is accomplished using targeted multiple reaction monitoring LC-MS/MS methods.

mouse gastric tissue. Project 3 (Cover) will employ metabolomics methods to examine metabolite changes in
a gerbil model in response to dietary factors that predispose to gastric cancer. Project 3 will also utilize IMS
methods to measure changes in metabolites, proteins, and lipids in gastric tissue in a spatially-resolved manner
in animal models and in human tissue microarrays. In addition, Project 3 will use elemental analysis methods to
measure iron uptake in H. pylori as a function of environmental salt concentrations."
10920412,"Abstract
The exploration of genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes derived from brains with Alzheimer's disease
(AD) by powerful computational tools has developed new knowledge, including the identification of pathways
and targets that may be involved in the initiation and/or progression of the disease. The challenge is to find
drugs that impact those pathways and then validate the importance of those pathways – distinguishing primary
disease drivers from secondary events. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to probe
potential pathways in proof of concept, and ultimately therapeutic, clinical trials. In this renewal application, we
propose to discover and validate hypotheses for Drug Repurposing In AD (DRIAD) through three integrated,
complementary informatics approaches. Specifically, we will extend our systems pharmacology (DRIAD-SP)
tool of classical and network aware (prior-loaded) machine learning approaches to identify pathways and
targets altered in AD brains at different stages of disease progression using data from Accelerating Medicines
Partnership-AD available through Synapse (Aim 1); we will use chemical biology and systems pharmacology
approaches to discover the target selectivity of lead kinase inhibitors within human neuronal and glial cell types
using unbiased RNA-seq, proteomic and imaging studies followed by pathway analysis (Aim 2). We will
implement additional causal inferential strategies to emulate clinical trials in electronic health records (DRIAD-
EHR) data (Aim 3), with “prospective” outcomes using three big data sets: the UK-TRE with 20 year of
longitudinal records of 50M National Health Service patients, and the RPDR Database (based at Mass General
Brigham),and the Clalit database in Israel – each with 6M individuals followed for over 20 years. Each Aim has
two approaches: data-driven, hypothesis-generating analyses to discern disease-relevant drug signals; and
hypothesis-testing in which positive findings from one approach are evaluated using the other approaches to
assess rigor and reproducibility. This coordinated program compensates for the limitations of each individual
informatics approach to promote discovery and critical evaluation of “lead compounds” for known and novel AD
pathways. To execute this strategy, we have assembled a multi-site, multi-disciplinary team with expertise
ranging from clinical care to computer science and systems pharmacology. Some of the team members are AD
experts and others bring an outsider's perspective. Finally, as a deliverable, we will continue to produce open-
source data packages to release all the supporting evidence, software, and data with provenance in
accordance with FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible) standards through Synapse.
These data packages have lead to one clinical trial and will help to prioritize follow on clinical and translational
studies including collaborations with industry or community members at large involved in new clinical trials."

Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) constitute a large
class of natural products with a wide range of biological activities, including anticancer,
antinociceptive, antiplasmodial, and antibacterial. The biosynthetic enzymes that convert linear,
inactive peptide substrates into constrained bioactive compounds are not well understood,
especially with regards to enzyme mechanism, substrate recognition and in their utility for
producing new derivatives. The Nair research group has been engaged in research to address
these questions for the past 18 years. We seek to carry out biochemical, structural biological, and
engineering studies on several classes of RiPP biosynthetic enzymes and address questions
regarding substrate recognition, and substrate tolerance. We anticipate that this work will be of
use not only towards the discovery of new therapeutic compounds but to enable the production
of both of improved versions of these bioactive compounds, as well as new to enable production
of peptide-based compounds for which the biosynthetic pathways are not known."
10757946,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In recent decades, the emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria has greatly outpaced the discovery of novel
antibacterial agents. This research is focused on the synthesis and biological study of antibiotics effective against
these modern pathogens of urgent threat. To this end, the lincosamides have been identified as an
underexploited class of antibiotics. No new lincosamide has entered the market since clindamycin was approved
more than 50 years ago (FDA, 1970). Growing resistance to clindamycin and its propensity to induce life-
threatening Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) colitis have limited its utility in today’s armamentarium. Due to the
structural complexity of this class of natural products, semi-synthetic strategies are insufficient to support future
antibiotic drug discovery within this or related scaffolds. Here, efficient synthetic pathways will be developed and
implemented to prepare a large collection of lincosamide analogs inaccessible by any other means. These
include analogs of a lead candidate, iboxamycin, which features a novel bicyclic oxepanoprolinamide scaffold
and is efficacious in vitro and in vivo against a broad range of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria. The latter
include MDR ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.), identified by the WHO as targets
of highest priority in antibiotic development. By elucidating the mechanistic underpinnings and drivers of in vivo
efficacy of iboxamycin and future lead antibiotics, this research will deliver multiple novel antibiotic scaffolds for
preclinical exploration to target these challenging pathogens."
10760230,"RNA helicases are a class of enzymes that modulate RNA structure in living cells, functioning in every aspect
of RNA biology from transcription to decay. However, the precise biological function of the vast majority of the
~40 eukaryotic RNA helicases is largely unknown. In the previous funding cycle, we provided one of the first
identifications of in vivo enzymatic helicase targets for a DEAD-box helicase to date. Moreover, we uncovered
a novel role for RNA structure remodeling in transcription termination of RNA polymerase II in S. cerevisiae.
This activity is regulated in response to environmental cues to control the expression of metabolic genes, a role
that we found is conserved in human cells with the mammalian DEAD-box helicase DDX5. Strikingly, OBP2-
dependent non-coding transcripts termed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) form RNA-DNA hybrid structures
or R-loops upon inactivation of Dbp2 that function in gene regulation. However, the mechanism(s) linking these
multiple observations remains unknown. Filling this gap is of key importance because misregulation of
numerous RNA helicases, including DDX5, results in disease states such as neurological disorders and
cancer. Major remaining questions are: 1. How does Dbp2-dependent RNA structure impact termination? 2.
What is the relationship between R-loop suppression and Dbp2? 3. Does mammalian Dbp2, termed DDX5,
function in termination regulation through RNA remodeling? Our central hypothesis is that Dbp2 and DDX5 are
members of a novel class of epigenetic regulators that unwind RNA structures in nascent RNAs to control
transcription termination and R-loop formation in response to cellular energy status. We propose to test this
hypothesis with three, focused Specific Aims, which integrate newly established and innovative strategies with
proven experimental techniques. In Aim 1, we will define how RNA structure impacts transcriptional
termination. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanistic relationship between Dbp2 and R-loop suppression.
In Aim 3, we will identify the enzymatic targets of DDX5 in human cells and connection to transcription
termination. This research is relevant to multiple aspects of RNA biology, gene regulation, and human disease."

In a professional table tennis rally, the time between successive ping pong ball hits is around 400ms. Within
this timeframe, the players must rapidly categorize the motion and spin of the ball to appropriately guide the
ongoing motion of their paddle to successfully strike the ball. While numerous studies have investigated the
oculomotor system’s role in the visual categorization process, few have done so where the response must be
initiated in advance of relevant sensory information, such as in the aforementioned example. Thus, the
temporal dynamics of sensory modulation of saccadic decisions remain largely unresolved. To identify the
manner in which visual categorization informs ongoing motor plans, I propose recording neural activity from
populations of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), frontal eye field (FEF), and superior colliculus (SC)
while monkeys perform a saccade-based motion categorization task in which motor planning always precedes
the identification of the visual stimulus; consequently revealing the temporal evolution of a categorical
judgment with millisecond resolution. Results from prior studies identified neurons in LIP and FEF that
demonstrate categorical tuning, with increased firing rates when stimuli belonging to the preferred category
appear on screen. Additionally, a recent study from our lab demonstrates the causal role of LIP in visual
categorization in which reversible inactivation of LIP leads to significant deficits in categorization accuracy.
However, the task structure utilized by these studies precludes any attempt to uncover the manner in which
categorical signals influence ongoing motor plans, or identify differences in the timing and strength of
categorical encoding between these brain regions. To date, no study has investigated categorical encoding in
SC, thus we will be the first to identify its role in visual categorization. By simultaneously recording from large,
diverse populations of neurons with linear arrays across these interconnected brain regions, the proposed
research will provide critical insight into the temporal dynamics underlying the transformation of sensory
evidence into oculomotor decisions."

Administrative Core of the proposed BCM-TSU P20 CURED program will serve as a primary administrative unit
that oversees the collaborative research, education and associated outreach efforts between the two institutions.
The goal of Administrative Core is to ensure continuity of the strong and productive ongoing partnership between
BCM and TSU to enhance cancer research and education capacity at both BCM and TSU while promoting the
diversity of the cancer research workforce. This is to be accomplished through activities such as administrative
oversight, operational support, communications, as well as regulatory and financial oversight. The two objectives
of Administrative Core are: (1) To provide integrated administrative support, promote recruitment and increase
diversity: The pilot projects and cores will benefit from centralized activities regarding budgetary activity, including
dispensing monies, overseeing budgets, generating interim and final financial reports and resolving disputes. In
addition, the administrative core with input from the IAC will use the discretionary funds it receives each year to
support new pilot projects in both institutions. It will collaborate with the Education core (C-REP) to promote
sustainable cancer research and education capacity in P20 program. It will also facilitate C-REP to develop
systematic curriculum and educational research programs between the institutions. It will conduct planning and
evaluation of the P20 partnership, ensure the partnership follows NIH policies and guidelines and submit the
annual financial and scientific reports to the IAC, EAC and NIH. (2) To provide scientific oversight and promote
collaborations: The core will provide scientific oversight by arranging internal meetings of investigators,
assessing research progress, and providing project management support to ensure that milestones are
accomplished in a timely manner. It will also coordinate internal and external advisory committee meetings and
implement the recommendations received. It will ensure frequent interactions and promote collaborations
between members of both the institutions by conducting regular seminars and monthly meetings. It will work with
institutional leaders to promote recruitment of new workforce to ensure diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). We
expect this BCU-TSU P20 CURED program will evolve to be a highly collaborative, systematic and sustainable
partnership between the two institutions that synergizes strengths of faculty and students in cancer research,
education and community outreach."

 Every cell division requires the faithful duplication of genetic material from
mother cell to daughter cell. Defects in the proper execution of the DNA
replication program can directly result in the genome instability that is a hallmark
of nearly all cancer cells. To ensure genome stability, the machinery responsible
for DNA replication must be highly regulated. There must be enough flexibility
built into the DNA replication program, however, to accommodate the dramatic
changes in cell cycle and S phase progression that occur during the development
of an organism. Understanding this regulation is imperative to determine how
genome stability is maintained during development.
 We utilize the powerful developmental systems available in Drosophila to
identify key regulators of the DNA replication program, with the ultimate goal of
delineating the molecular underpinnings responsible for regulating genome
duplication and stability during development. Our main focus is understanding
how replication initiation is regulated to ensure genome stability. We have
defined three key projects where the strength of our system positions us to make
key insights. These include: 1) understanding the functional relationship between
nuclear pore proteins and the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC). 2) Defining the
key targets and molecular mechanisms Rif1 uses to influence replication initiation.
3) Identifying and characterizing posttranslational modifications of ORC that
affect replication initiation."

Telomeres are nucleoproteins with TTAGGG DNA repeats at the ends of chromosomes that protect coding DNA from
erosion and detection as DNA damage. Telomere maintenance is necessary for cancer cells to have unlimited proliferation
capacity. Most cancers maintain their telomeres via activation of the ribonucleoprotein telomerase. Cancers with low or no
telomerase activity often use another mechanism to extend their telomeres, the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT)
in which telomeres are maintained via homologous telomeric-DNA recombination, but the mechanism is still poorly
understood. ALT+ tumors contain extra-chromosomal telomeric DNA C-circles, which (detected with a unique PCR assay)
provides a specific and sensitive ALT biomarker. Employing the C-circle assay we have surveyed a variety of childhood
and adult cancers and found 11 cancer histologies with ALT-positivity ranging from 10% to 74% and an additional 5 cancer
histologies with 1 to 5% that are ALT+. ALT cancers have a poor clinical outcome and regardless of histology ALT+
cancer cell lines manifest high resistance to DNA damaging agents relative to telomerase+ cancers. ALT cancers have
dysfunctional telomeres, which provides unique vulnerabilities that can serve as novel therapeutic targets. We have recently
demonstrated high ATM kinase activation in ALT neuroblastoma leads to resistance to DNA damaging chemotherapy that
can be reversed with a clinical-stage ATM inhibitor AZD0156. Based on our data we hypothesize that ALT+ cancers share
both common mechanisms of resistance to standard therapies and common vulnerabilities that may be exploited for therapy.
To enhance studies of ALT+ cancer biology, discovery and validation of novel therapeutic targets, and to enable comparing
ALT+ cancers across a range of histologies we have assembled a large panel of ALT+ patient-derived cell lines (PDCLs)
and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and comparator telomerase+ PDCLs and PDXs, including pediatric cancers
(neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma) and adult cancers (triple negative breast cancer, colon cancer, soft
tissue sarcomas). Using this unique panel of patient-derived models we will demonstrate that ATM kinase activation
resulting from telomere dysfunction is a common feature of ALT+ cancers (regardless of histology). We will demonstrate
that clinical-stage investigational drugs leveraging the high ATM kinase activation in ALT+ cancers (the ATM kinase
inhibitor AZD1390 and the p53 activator APR-246) combined with irinotecan have significantly higher activity in ALT+
cancers relative to telomerase+ comparators. For cell lines and xenografts of selected histologies we will determine if
AZD1390 can reverse resistance to irinotecan. We hypothesize that ALT+ cancers tolerate ATM activation due to
dysfunctional p53, and that p53 restored to functionality by APR-246 will be activated (phosphorylated) by ATM. We will
demonstrate that APR-246 (alone or in combination with irinotecan) will be selectively cytotoxic to ALT+ relative to
telomerase+ cancer cell lines and xenografts. This project will demonstrate that the unique vulnerability conferred by the
dependence of ALT+ cancers cells on ATM kinase is common to ALT+ cancers across a range of cancer histologies. Data
from this project will inform development of histology-agnostic clinical trials seeking to enroll patients with ALT+ cancers
that are readily identifiable with a robust tumor biomarker."

The link between dietary intake/metabolism and long-term health and disease was first established nearly a
century ago. Dietary restriction (DR), defined as a decrease in caloric intake without malnutrition, remains the
most potent and reproducible intervention to improve health and longevity across multiple species.
Unfortunately, long-term DR is both relatively untested and very difficult to implement in humans, leading
scientists to better define the mechanisms through which DR improves health in an effort to mimic the benefits
in the absence of true DR. This project focuses on a family of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, flavin-
containing monooxygenases, or FMOs, that are induced downstream of DR and were recently reported to be
both necessary and sufficient to increase health, stress resistance, and longevity in the nematode C. elegans.
Interestingly, previous reports also show induction of FMO homologs in mammalian systems under DR and
other conditions known to increase longevity. Unfortunately, the mechanism(s) for the effects of these well-
conserved FMO proteins on health and longevity are largely unknown, as their primary role in phase I
xenobiotic detoxification is not clearly linked to the observed effects on health and longevity. This project will
build upon recently published and preliminary data that support a role for FMO enzymes in regulating
endogenous metabolism. Utilizing recently developed tools, including a novel food source for nematodes to
better measure their metabolism and a metabolomics based technique to use oxygen isotopes and identify
substrates of oxygenases, this project will identify the mechanisms and implications for FMO activity within the
simple nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. The preliminary data clearly establish one-carbon metabolism
(OCM) as the key intermediate metabolic network affected by FMO-2 to improve health and increase longevity.
The data produced by this project will provide evidence as to 1) what the key endogenous target(s) of FMO-2
are and how they connect to OCM, 2) how OCM flux is modified by FMO-2 expression and activity and how
this may be replicated through exogenous metabolites, and 3) what mechanisms are downstream of OCM and
how they play into understanding the intertwined nature of stress response and longevity. To ensure the
success of this project, all assays will be performed by experts in nematode biology and aging in collaboration
with experts in metabolomics profiling and data analysis. The resulting data will provide a model for the
metabolic impact of FMO enzymes that can then be further interrogated in mammalian systems. In addition,
since the pathways focused on are important for multiple age-associated diseases, they may lead to
approaches that improve health with or without exploiting the mechanism(s) of FMO activity."

Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) disproportionally affects small children, and immunopathology likely contributes
to its high mortality and physical and cognitive morbidity. Recent unbiased cross-omics studies have identified
biological pathways involved in the outcome of TBM in adults that could help development of more effective host-
directed therapy for TBM, but it is unknown if similar or other pathways are implicated in childhood TBM.
We previously identified high levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tryptophan, a nutrient for Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, and genetic traits that predict CSF tryptophan concentrations as strong markers for mortality of
TBM. By integrating large-scale clinical, metabolomics and genomics data we have strengthened these findings
and identified additional metabolic pathways implicated in outcome of TBM in adult patients. Separately, we
found that CSF levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-10), as well as genetic traits associated with CSF
MMP-10 levels, also predict mortality of adult TBM patients. This suggests that metalloproteinases may also be
implicated in TBM outcome, possibly through blood-brain barrier dysfunction resulting in cerebral edema and
influx of inflammatory cells. These findings raise the question if these biological pathways are also involved in
the immunopathology and poor outcome of pediatric TBM. Lastly, we recently showed that adjunctive aspirin
might reduce brain infarctions and death from TBM in adults. Therefore, we are conducting a separately funded
phase 3 clinical trial of aspirin in children with TBM to determine if it reduces mortality and long-term disability.
Therefore, based on our previous work we hypothesize that: specific metabolic pathways including tryptophan
metabolism influence outcome of pediatric TBM, and that this is genetically regulated (Aim 1);
metalloproteinases are implicated in the immunopathology and outcome of TBM (Aim 2); and integration of
large-scale clinical and ‘omics’ data and comparison of pediatric and adult TBM patients can predict the
therapeutic effect of aspirin, and identify novel targets for host-directed therapy of pediatric TBM (Aim 3). To test
these hypotheses, we will combine unique access to some of the largest clinical studies in TBM globally with
exceptional expertise in integration of multi-omics and deep-phenotyping data.
Our strong preliminary data, access to two large bioarchives from adult TBM, an on-going randomized controlled
trial in pediatric TBM, and expertise in integration of large-scale clinical and multi-layer ‘omics’ data promises to
provide a step-change in understanding childhood TBM pathogenesis and discovery of new targets for future
host-directed therapies."

The long term objective of the Texas Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach (Texas MiHERO) is to
expand the capacity of University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) to enhance research and
research training in minority health and health disparities by increasing the number of under-represented
students in health disparity research, providing interdisciplinary research and leadership training to junior faculty,
and increasing the number of health professional faculty involved in health disparity research. Given the
substantial need for physicians, physician scientists, and other health professionals to care for vulnerable
populations, and the critical need to study diseases and conditions that disproportionately affect these groups,
more efforts are needed to increase the participation of individuals from diverse backgrounds in conducting
research on minority health and health disparities, and encouraging them to consider careers in research and
related fields. The Texas Center for Health Disparities (TCHD), a NIMHD-Specialized Center of Excellence
developed the MiHERO program, through the NIMHD S21 mechanism, to increase health disparity research
capacity by increasing the size of the PhD workforce in health disparities, train junior faculty in interdisciplinary
research leadership, and provide opportunities for senior investigators to develop research focus in minority
health and health disparities. Four priority activities will be conducted under the MiHERO program:
 • Priority Activity 1: Support an Interdisciplinary Research Leadership (IRL) Program for junior faculty in
 Minority Health and Health Disparities
• Priority Activity 2: Recruit/Retain diverse faculty through a Health Education, Awareness and Research
 in Disparities Scholarship (HEARD Scholars) program in Minority Health and Health Disparities.
• Priority Activity 3: Increase the diversity of the biomedical, behavioral and clinical research workforce by
 recruiting a new cohort of PhD students from minority and underrepresented groups each year who focus
 on health disparities.
• Priority Activity 4: Develop a mechanism for minority health and health disparity researchers to engage
 community members in their research.
Using the endowment funds secured through this mechanism of funding, we will ensure robust training
opportunities are provided that encourage participants of the proposed program to seek careers in research and
related field that address the issue of health disparities. The impact of the endowment income will be sustainable
programs in Minority Health and Health Disparities, including health disparity curricula for PhD students, a junior
faculty development program that can be expanded to faculty from other institutions, and a cadre of health
disparity researchers who have active research projects in the area of Minority Health and Health Disparities."

Malaria cases and deaths have been unchanged for the past 6 years despite $3-4 B annual investment in control
measures. A highly efficacious vaccine would save lives by providing durable protection against infection and
support global eradication efforts by blocking transmission. Current malaria control strategies including
insecticide-impregnated bed nets, indoor residual spraying and antimalarial drugs have reduced malaria rates in
many countries, but malaria still causes 247 million cases and 619,000 deaths annually. In late 2022, the WHO
published its Preferred Product Characteristics for Malaria Vaccines. Strategic Goal 1 was, “Malaria vaccines
that prevent human blood-stage infection at the individual level in >90% of recipients.” Successful development
and deployment of a highly efficacious malaria vaccine with these characteristics would both reduce malaria
morbidity and mortality and accelerate malaria eradication efforts. The only malaria vaccines that have ever
reached this level of efficacy have been Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ) vaccines, including PfSPZ
Vaccine and PfSPZ-CVac. To achieve the tolerability and safety of PfSPZ Vaccine and the VE and potency of
PfSPZ-CVac, a 3rd generation vaccine has been created and manufactured in compliance with cGMPs. PfSPZ-
LARC2 is a late arresting replication competent (LARC) parasite, attenuated by deletion of two genes. PfSPZ-
LARC2 Vaccine will undergo clinical assessment of tolerability, safety, and vaccine efficacy (VE) in 2023 in the
US and Germany. The next steps for clinical development of PfSPZ-LARC2 Vaccine include safety and
immunogenicity testing in malaria-experienced adults with subsequent age de-escalation and additional safety,
immunogenicity, and VE testing in children living in a highly endemic area. The proposed research seeks to plan
for a two-part clinical trial in a highly endemic area of Burkina Faso. Part one will include testing in adults,
adolescents, and children, and part two will expand PfSPZ-LARC2 Vaccine testing in children. Planning activities
that will be supported by the current proposal include development of the clinical trial protocol, informed consent
form, manual of procedures, case report forms, data management plan, data and safety monitoring plan,
protocol-specific training materials and plans for study staff, trial budget, study product management plan, and

10767888,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Research Experience and Training Coordination Core 
The 20th century brought the chemical revolution and the steady increase of large-scale production of 
chemicals. Only later did the problem of environmental persistence of some of these new and useful chemicals 
become evident, and only recently did we discover the magnitude of the negative health effects caused by 
these pollutants, including brain diseases and metabolic syndrome, cancer, fertility problems, reduced immune 
system function, and even hearing loss and autism. Moreover, these pollutants may volatilize and contaminate 
indoor and outdoor air. Environmental health and engineering professionals must now deal with these legacy 
contaminants in multiple dimensions to protect humans and the environment, and to prevent future 
contamination. As a consequence, the traditional training approach designed to produce specialized experts in 
individual, narrow disciplines is clearly inappropriate to prepare trainees for leadership roles in environmental 
health and technology. Instead, future scientists and engineers need thorough training in their specific fields, 
supported by basic knowledge of diverse areas (socioeconomics, policy, engineering, and science), along with 
communication and collaboration skills to work with specialists in other disciplines and with varied stakeholders 
and affected communities. To properly prepare students and post-docs, the Iowa Superfund Research 
Program (ISRP) Research Experience and Training Coordination Core (RETCC) will: 1) identify, promote, 
evaluate, and track interdisciplinary training approaches; 2) coordinate training in ISRP methods and 
applications; 3) develop opportunities for trainee participation in the ISRP Community Engagement Core and in 
research translation activities; 4) interact with the ISRP Data Management and Analysis Core to provide 
training in data management, analysis, and data sharing; and 5) offer opportunities for professional career 
development. In the last funding circle (April 2015–November 2018), 48 graduate students and postdocs (24 
ongoing) obtained such training. To build on this success, we are creating and coordinating a unique set of 
courses, seminars, workshops, community outreach, and research translation experiences, so all ISRP 
trainees can gain insights into health effects, risk, detection, and remediation of polychlorinated biphenyls 
(PCBs), the needs of stakeholders and affected communities, and how to build a successful career. ISRP 
researchers make this possible through established, successful, supportive collaborations with colleagues 
representing diverse areas such as toxicology, occupational and environmental health, medicinal 
pharmacology, environmental and medical engineering, and urban and regional planning, along with 
extraordinary support from the University of Iowa Graduate College. The RETCC’s unique resources will 
ensure its future success of preparing a new generation of scientists and engineers to solve the environmental 
pollution challenges of the 21st century."
10767891,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Analytical Core
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are important Superfund chemicals that are known human carcinogens also
associated with neurological and metabolic disruption. The Analytical Core (AC) provides analytical services to
the ISRP to facilitate high-quality research on PCBs, including data, standard operating procedures, and peer-
reviewed publications that are standardized, efficient, and comparable across all ISRP matrices and projects.
The AC provides instrumentation and facilities, expert staff, training, data sharing platforms, and support for
method development. The AC will continue to accomplish these activities through five Specific Aims: Aim 1.
Maintain analytical quality assurance (QA) standards and protocols. Accurate, precise, representative,
reproducible, and comparable sample analysis is absolutely essential for all five ISRP projects and is a key AC
objective. The exceptional rigor of the QA protocol for PCB analysis provides a critical foundation for
discoveries by the ISRP projects. Aim 2. Facilitate high-throughput analysis in complex biotic and abiotic
matrices. The AC supports ISRP projects by extracting and analyzing samples for all 209 PCBs and 72 OH-
PCBs as MeO-PCBs in complex matrices, including: air samples collected on quartz filters, XAD resin, and
polyurethane foam; sediment, water, and pore water samples; human serum; laboratory animal tissues; plant
tissues; soils; microbial cultures; and polymers, paints, and pigments. To support new research directions
within the ISRP, we will expand our capabilities to include analyses of food matrices and the ability to quantify
all 837 possible mono-hydroxylated PCBs. Aim 3. Provide prioritized training and access to AC facilities. The
AC, in collaboration with the Research Experience and Training Coordination Core, provides prioritized,
standardized training in AC facilities and methods to graduate student and postdoc trainees, faculty, and staff
from all ISRP projects. Trainees also receive assistance in method development and use of instrumentation.
Aim 4. Support method development for complex matrices. The AC, in collaboration with ISRP projects, will
continue to develop, maintain, and update methods for high-throughput PCB and OH-PCB extraction and
analysis in biotic and abiotic samples. Separate but comparable methods are maintained across matrices to
facilitate integrated data analysis. Aim 5. Maintain analytical infrastructure. The AC maintains critical
infrastructure, including high-use analytical instruments, a sample database, and archives such as standard
solutions, samples, and sample extracts. The AC, in collaboration with the Data Management and Analysis
Core, will provide oversight to make data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) by ISRP
investigators. Overall, the AC is a fully-integrated support core that assists ISRP projects to meet all four SRP
mandates requiring methods for identifying human health hazards of superfund chemicals, detection,
assessment of exposure risk, and remediation."
10767959,"Project Summary / Abstract
Individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS) compose a significant and growing proportion of our U.S. and global
population (> 25%). It has been established that the presence of chronic diseases, such as MetS, enhances and
prolongs environmental exposure-induced inflammation. Individuals with MetS have demonstrated enhanced
inflammation due to ambient particulate matter exposures of which a significant proportion is nano-sized. The
mechanisms associated with this enhanced susceptibility represent a significant gap in our knowledge. Mounting
data from the Shannahan laboratory suggests that dysregulation of inflammatory resolution contributes to the
exacerbated toxicity and disease progression observed in MetS. Specifically, nanoparticle inhalation exposures
induce a pulmonary inflammatory response that is exacerbated and extended due to MetS. This inflammatory
response corresponds with suppression of specialized pro-resolving mediators that facilitate inflammatory
resolution. Our data suggests following inhalation, nanoparticles gain unique biocoronas on their surface that
enhance the pro-inflammatory response while inhibiting resolution signaling. Further, our preliminary data
demonstrates MetS disrupts ω-3 fatty acid metabolism impairing resolution. This proposal examines the
hypothesis that dysregulation of inflammatory resolution following nanoparticle exposure mediates the
susceptibility observed in MetS by exacerbating inflammatory responses and facilitating development and
progression of chronic disease. The hypothesis will be tested through the completion of three main goals: 1)
Delineation of pulmonary nanoparticle-biocorona alterations throughout metabolic syndrome development and
the inflammation signaling consequences; 2) Determination of inflammatory resolution and specialized pro-
resolving mediator kinetics following nanoparticle exposure in MetS and healthy mouse models; 3) Elucidation
of differential ω-3 fatty acid metabolism in MetS following nanoparticle exposure. These mechanisms represent
potential key regulators that are dysregulated in MetS, facilitating exacerbated responses and also are potential
targets of therapeutic interventions. Typically, research and treatment strategies addressing exposure-induced
inflammation focus on suppression of pro-inflammatory pathways rather than elucidation and effective
stimulation of resolution processes. Completion of the project will generate new knowledge required to
understand distinct mechanisms of toxicity in prevalent and sensitive subpopulations such as MetS. Elucidation
of these mechanisms will allow for new disease prevention and treatment strategies while also broadening public
health protections to environmental exposures."

data; clinical-molecular data integration; and interpretation, annotation, and integration of results. The Cancer
Informatics Shared Resource (CISR) provides Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) members with cutting-edge
multi-omics data analytics and translational data science, advanced natural language processing research and
application development, data storage infrastructure, and expert consulting and collaboration to support all
aspects of their research.
CISR is a combination of the previous Bioinformatics and Clinical Informatics Shared Resources. It is led by
Dr. Jinhua Wang, a Full Professor in the University of Minnesota Institute for Health Informatics and a
computational biologist with research interests in computational modeling of high-throughput cancer multi-
omics data. He is supported by Dr. Scott Walmsley, who was recruited to lead proteomics/DNA adductomics
informatics, and Dr. Steven Johnson, who heads the Clinical Informatics Shared Service (CISS). Additional
staff were recruited or promoted, and a genomics data repository was built to link genomic information with
clinical health records.
CISR will achieve its mission through 5 specific aims: 1) Support MCC researchers with advanced capabilities
in cancer multi-omics informatics and clinical data science and analytics, through a FAIR and artificial
intelligence/machine learning–ready data environment; 2) Pursue development of new methods in the areas of
single-cell multi-omics, spatial transcriptomics imaging, and AI deep learning predictive models for cancer
research; 3) Enhance clinical trial recruitment via data-driven understanding of the factors determining accrual
success and decision models to enhance accrual; 4) Develop and provide integration infrastructure and
methods towards developing cancer patient Digital Twins to support predictive oncology research and patient
care; and 5) Provide education and training in multi-omics data analytics, spatialomics data integration, and
precision oncology.
CISR also has close collaborations with the Clinical Trials Office, Translational Therapy Shared Resource,
Biostatistics Shared Resource, and the Cancer Research Translational Initiative within MCC, as well as with
the Institute for Health Informatics and the Clinical and Translational Science Institute in the larger University
community.
In fiscal year 2022, 47 individuals used CISR services, of whom 41 were MCC members."

10768163,"Genome Engineering Shared Resource Summary
The goals of the Genome Engineering Shared Resource (GESR) are to utilize state-of-the-art CRISPR/Cas9-
mediated precise genome engineering to efficiently generate desired modifications in mammalian (most
frequently human) cells in an accurate and timely manner. This will be done through the following specific
aims: 1) To provide CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing design services coordinated with the individual researcher with
the goal of generating the desired genetic modification in their model cell line; 2) To provide CRISPR/Cas9
targeting reagents to be used by clients if they have the personnel and expertise already in place in their own
laboratory for gene-targeting experiments; 3) To use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate cell lines of an
investigator's choice containing a) knockouts of non-essential genes, b) conditional knockouts of essential
genes, c) knock-in mutations, or d) gene tagging; 4) To work with the Mouse Genetics Laboratory (MGL)
Shared Resource to create mutant mice using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting; and 5) To work with the
Stem Cell Institute with the goal of offering CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of human induced pluripotent stem
cells for researchers requiring this service.
The GESR provides Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) members with convenient, cost-effective access to these
reagents and services for genetic modification that can only rarely (or very expensively) be obtained from
commercial sources. Access to these human cell lines and associated CRISPR/Cas9 technologies is critical to
the ongoing work of the MCC, especially to members of the Genetic Mechanisms, Immunology, and Cellular
Mechanisms Programs.
Over the past 7 years, the GESR has successfully generated 61 independent knockouts of non-essential
genes, 5 conditional knockouts, 20 single-nucleotide knock-ins, and 11 gene-tagged cell lines and has assisted
MGL in the generation of 8 knockout, 12 conditional knockout, 9 knock-in, and 10 gene-tagged mouse strains.
The GESR is co-led by Drs. Branden Moriarity (Genetic Mechanisms [GM] and Transplant and Cellular
Therapy [TCT] Programs) and Dr. Beau Webber (GM and TCT). Dr. Moriarity has over 10 years of experience
in gene editing using TALENs and the CRISPR/Cas9 system. His laboratory focuses on gene editing in
primary human immune cells for research and therapy. Dr. Webber has over 6 years of experience in gene
editing. His focus is to synergize genome engineering, stem cell biology, and adoptive cellular therapy to
develop cures for genetic disease and cancer. The GESR is coordinated by Walker Lahr, who brings 7 years of
experience to GESR.
In fiscal year 2022, 32 individuals used GESR services, of whom 28 were MCC members."
10768164,"Mouse Genetics Laboratory Shared Resource Summary
The Mouse Genetics Laboratory (MGL) Shared Resource provides Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) and Office
of Academic Clinical Affairs (OACA) members with access to state-of-the-art technologies required to create
and efficiently study genetically modified mice. Genetically modified mice have been vital tools for cancer
studies for many years, enabling researchers to determine the roles of specific genes in cancer-relevant traits
such as immune evasion, tumor initiation, and metastasis. MGL meets this need through the following specific
aims: 1) Produce transgenic and knockout mice, 2) Cryopreserve mouse sperm and embryos, 3) Assist with
mouse embryo manipulation, and 4) Provide scientific consultation and specialized services.
These services provide MCC members convenient, cost-effective access to genetically modified mice. Access
to these mice and associated technologies is critical to the ongoing work of MCC, particularly to members of
the Genetic Mechanisms, Immunology, and Cellular Mechanisms Programs.
MGL is led by Dr. Timothy Hallstrom, who has 15 years of experience with mouse genetics research. He is the
PI of a research laboratory focused on the cellular mechanisms controlling the retinoblastoma protein. Day-to-
day operations of MGL are managed by Yun You, PhD, who also educates users of the laboratory on policies,
protocols, and maintenance of transgenic mouse strains.
During the current period of support, MGL was able to rapidly respond to investigators’ needs during the
COVID-19 outbreak by processing many different lines for sperm cryopreservation. We introduced a new
service that allows 2-cell embryos to be frozen for later rederivation. This circumvents the usual need for
sometimes complex breeding encountered after standard frozen embryo derivation. We have also worked with
the Genome Engineering Shared Resource to significantly improve the efficacy of CRISPR with large DNA
constructs by using adeno-associated virus for CRISPR delivery of large insertions (~4.5 kb).
Services offered internally by MGL are often more cost-effective and efficient than using external providers.
MGL is supported by the University as well as CCSG funds, and MCC members are given priority over other
users. In fiscal year 2022, 34 researchers used MGL services, of whom 27 were MCC members."

10773355,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Therapeutic approaches in cancer therapies have evolved from the use of highly toxic chemotherapy agents to
precision medicine with well-defined targets and minimal toxicities. While precision medicine is highly
desirable, its effectiveness depends on the presence of the activating agents and typically target a single
pathway which is conducive to the development of drug resistance when alternative pathways and or feedback
mechanisms are used. These limitations are best exemplified by anti-cancer therapies targeting the protein
translation regulator mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR). Although these inhibitors show clear benefit in
some cancers such as mantle cell lymphomas, Renal Cell Carcinoma and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex-related
tumors they have limited efficacy as single agents in most other cancers due to compensatory feedback
mechanisms. In addition, targeting components of the general protein translational machinery that are also
essential for normal cell functions would likely contribute to normal tissue toxicity. Agents that could target
simultaneously a number of limited key pathways essential for cancer cells progression and survival would
thus be expected to decrease toxicity and resistance. To this Aim we have identified first in class small
molecule inhibitors of hnRNP A18, a regulator of protein translation in cancer cells. hnRNP A18 targets
transcripts that are involved in cancer progression, metastasis, angiogenesis, anti-apoptosis and tumor
immune checkpoint. Our working hypothesis is that small molecule inhibitors of hnRNP A18 will inhibit the
translation of specific RNA transcripts devoted to conferring growth advantages and immune protection to
cancer cells. To verify this hypothesis three complementary specific Aims have been designed: Aim 1:
Design, synthesize and improve small molecule inhibitors of hnRNP A18. Aim 2: Prioritize compounds through
in vitro methods including RNA binding, cell reporter assay, proliferation and toxicity. Aim 3: Determine in vivo
anti-tumor and ADMET properties of lead compounds, employing, xenograft, syngeneic and Patients Derived
(PDX) tumors models. A multidisciplinary team of experts composed of medicinal chemists, structural

10773669,"Advances in genome technologies ushered in vast cost reductions in DNA sequencing and increased read
lengths, the latter afforded by development of new single-molecule sequencing technologies. As a result, much
of the genome’s “dark matter” has been elucidated, and higher-quality reference genomes were made available.
In addition to genome sequencing, these single-molecule methods have enabled new applications for probing
chemical modifications in DNA, by either probing the kinetics of sequencing-by-synthesis using optical
waveguides, or by electrically distinguishing modified bases using nanopores.
Despite progress, a critical barrier in genomics is understanding the roles of RNA in biology, which demands
methods for quantitative analysis of RNA molecules in a cell. The myriad of types of RNAs in a cell, their dynamic
chemical modifications, and their elaborate structural and functional diversity, all hint at a tremendous level of
regulation and biological significance. Traditional RNA sequencing methods have primarily relied on conversion
to complementary DNA (cDNA) followed by cDNA sequencing using either high-throughput second-generation
methods or third generation single-molecule methods, the latter of which offers long reads. Using these methods,
some RNA modifications can be read through prior chemical functionalization of the RNA prior to conversion to
cDNA (for example, m6A, pseudouridine, A-to-I editing, 1-methyluridine, and dihydrouridine). However, the
chemical reactions involved in these methods are not 100% quantitative or specific, and further, detection is
often done through incomplete reads due to reverse transcription blocks, which precludes detection of multiple
modifications. The only available method for direct RNA sequencing, the Oxford Nanopore Technologies
platform, suffers from several drawbacks that include high input requirements, limited ability to probe RNA
modifications, and incomplete reads, particularly near the RNA 5’ end.
We address these limitations by developing a new single-molecule method that can be scaled to allow long read
direct RNA sequencing at high throughputs, all with very low input requirements of several picograms. Building
on zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs) originally developed by Pacific Biosciences, we have recently developed
electro-optical ZMWs (eZMWs) that allow low-input capture of DNA and RNA molecules. We demonstrated using
these devices identification of DNA fragments from low inputs by rapid capture of single molecules and their
flash sequencing. Together with the Pyle group, we are developing the integration of MarathonRT, an ultra-
processive reverse transcriptase that converts RNA molecules to cDNA molecules with high processivity and
accuracy, into our electro-optical eZMWs for direct RNA sequencing. We have already fused MarathonRT to a
streptavidin protein and demonstrated its functionality in eZMWs. Here we will build on these developments to
develop a direct RNA sequencing method that can detect single base edits and chemical modifications, all with
high coverage from single-cell inputs of a few pg per run."
10775744,"Loss or mutations in both alleles of the gene encoding ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
kinase results in early-onset cerebellar ataxia and progressive neurodegeneration in humans.
Mechanistic explanations for this phenotype, as well as for the related A-T like Disorder (ATLD)
caused by rare mutations in the MRE11 gene, have been elusive despite years of work on these
enzymes. ATM is a master regulator of the DNA damage response, controlling checkpoint
responses and survival of DNA damage in all cell types. We have previously characterized the
ATM protein kinase in vitro, using purified proteins to determine that ATM is activated at sites of
DNA double-strand breaks and can also be activated independently of breaks by oxidative
stress. In recent work we found that loss of ATM kinase activity results in the formation of
protein aggregates—detergent-resistant insoluble forms of proteins—enriched for polypeptides
with intrinsically disordered domains. These aggregates form in response to hyperactivation of
poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) that are activated at sites of transcriptional stress.
Analysis of 21 patient cerebellum tissue samples also showed massive levels of aggregates as
well as hyperPARylation in comparison to controls, consistent with these observations. Based
on this evidence we propose that protein aggregation may play a causal role in the
neurodegeneration that occurs in this disorder, similar to other forms of cerebellar ataxia and to
more common late-onset neurodegeneration in the human population. Here we propose to
characterize the origin of single-strand DNA breaks that occur in the absence of ATM function to
test the hypothesis that the combined effects of oxidative stress and transcription-dependent
damage is responsible for the strand breaks and resulting protein aggregates that are observed
with loss of ATM in human neurons. We will also characterize the locations and requirements
for strand breaks seen in neurons expressing ATLD alleles of MRE11 and test the hypothesis
that the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex promotes single-strand break repair using in vitro
biochemistry with purified proteins. These experiments will test novel hypotheses about the
functions of ATM and MRN in neurons and the origins of DNA damage during cerebellar
neurodegeneration."
10769039,"Abstract/Summary
All current techniques for the study of brain functions have limitations. Human brain activity and
functional connectivity for example, can be studied with non-invasive functional whole brain MR
methods. However, the spatiotemporal resolution and neuronal specificity of the MR technique
is limited. This limitation is imposed at two levels irrespective of the functional MR approach
employed: First, the inherent sensitivity of the MR approach limits the achievable spatial
resolution. Although the development of UHF fMRI has enabled human studies with nominal
voxel volumes of ~0.5 to1 µL to permit the detection of activity in cortical layers, columns, and
other fine scale organizations such voxels still contain more than forty to eighty thousand
neurons, capable of performing a multitude of different computations. The second limitation is
the indirect nature of the MR based functional mapping signals. Irrespective of the functional
contrast mechanism employed, they reflect physiological changes mediated by neurovascular
coupling and subsequent coupling to and perturbations of MR parameters and these
intermediary steps lead to ambiguities in spatiotemporal fidelity to neuronal activity especially at
the mesoscopic scale or cortical column and layers. More importantly, the relationship between
the MR based functional mapping signals and the underlying neuronal computations generated
by a plethora of neuronal processes and cell types organized in complex local circuits remains
largely unknown. This TRD seeks to overcome these limitations by improving the MR
measurements by exploiting advantages of uniquely high magnetic fields (10.5T and 16.4T) and
developing rigorous multi-modal (MRI-Electrophysiology and MRI-Multi Photon Imaging) data
acquisition approaches these ultrahigh magnetic fields to build sharable technologies as well as
to understand the nature of the functional MR signals."
10768746,"Neuromuscular disorders, including Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy and Pompe disease, are progressive and
often result in signiﬁcant disability and sometimes death. Encouragingly, novel enzyme replacement and ge-
netic therapies are becoming available, but they are associated with detrimental side effects and assessing their
efﬁcacy remains a challenge. Current methods used to assess muscle health are subjective, non-quantitative,
and focus on muscle quantity and strength; however, measuring muscle quantity can over-estimate the amount
of functional muscle, and muscle strength tests are affected by patient cooperation, pain, and co-morbidities.
There is an urgent and unmet clinical need for a low-cost, non-invasive biomarker to accurately assess
muscle health, monitor disease progression, and determine treatment response. Ultrasonic shear wave
elasticity (SWE) imaging methods estimate the biomechanical properties of soft tissues, and these methods
have demonstrated promise in the characterization of healthy and diseased muscle; however, commercially-
available SWE methods are limited to estimating material parameters from a 2D imaging plane, and measure-
ment variability and challenges with ﬁber alignment have limited clinical adoption. We have developed a 3D-
SWE imaging system and advanced reconstruction algorithms with which we have obtained preliminary
in vivo data that demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, the complex 3D shearwave behaviors generated by SWE
excitations in vivo in skeletal muscles, and have observed signiﬁcant differences between patients with
myopathy that are consistent with clinical strength metrics. We have developed reconstruction algorithms
that leverage the 3D-nature of these data to estimate multiple independent material properties, including: the
longitudinal and transverse shear moduli, the shear anisotropy, the tensile anisotropy, and the viscosity along
and across the muscle ﬁbers. We hypothesize that the more complete material characterization afforded by
these measurements will provide improved biomarkers of muscle health. We now propose to optimize the se-
quencing and minimize the 3D data acquisition time; to automate and validate our parameter reconstruction al-
gorithms; and to quantify the parameter measurement accuracy and precision in calibrated elasticity phantoms.
Finally, we propose a pilot clinical study in which we will quantify and compare 3D-SWE muscle parameters
in vivo in patients with myopathy and muscular dystrophy and in healthy controls, evaluate the repeatability of
these measurements, and assess their correlation with clinical measures of muscle health. Successful com-
pletion of this project will provide non-invasive quantitative biomarkers of muscle health on a low-cost
portable platform, enabling frequent measurement and longitudinal monitoring of disease progression
and treatment response which will facilitate personalized and optimized neuromuscular disease man-
agement."
10768748,"Abstract:
CMV infection in utero leads to prolonged viremia and often devastating clinical sequelae. In adults, it is
established that the T cell response to CMV is required for containment of viremia. However, the immunologic
determinants of viral control and clinical sequelae following congenital CMV infection are not known. In this
project, we will study the immune response to CMV as a window into immune ontogeny and the age-related
maturation of antiviral T cell function. We will leverage a large cohort of mother-infant pairs with samples
banked longitudinally for immunologic studies. This cohort, which includes a large number of infants infected
with CMV in utero and others infected during early childhood, affords a unique opportunity to examine the
relationship between the age-related maturation of the immune system and control of CMV viremia. Prior
studies have shown that two populations of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CD8 T and gd T cells, expand and
differentiate upon CMV infection in utero. We hypothesize that T cells generated during fetal development
(including both CD8 and gd T cells) are intrinsically biased toward rapid differentiation into terminal effector
cells. We further hypothesize that this effector-biased programming limits the ability of infant CD8 T cells to
generate the long-lived memory sub-populations that are required for sustained control of a chronic viral
infection. This hypothesis is supported by data from experimental murine models but has not been fully
examined in human infants in the context of a natural pathogen. While the CD8 response continues to mature
postnatally, gd T cells develop earlier in gestation and exhibit many innate-like qualities that could enable them
to act as important antiviral effectors in utero. Remarkably, gd T cells that express CMV-reactive gd TCRs and
pre-programmed effector functions are already present in the fetal thymus at mid-gestation. These fetal gd T
cells can be rapidly activated to produce IFNg and granzymes upon stimulation. Hence, we hypothesize that
fetal gd T cells play an important role in mediating anti-CMV effector functions in utero, while the adaptive ab T
cell response matures. In the first two aims, we will compare gd and CD8 T cell responses in congenitally CMV-
infected newborns to those of children who acquire primary CMV infection during the second year of life, in
order to identify critical pathways of immune maturation. CD8 and gd T cells will be assessed by high-
parameter cytometry, functional assays, and paired transcriptional and TCRseq profiling of individual cells in
order to identify differences in the response to CMV based on the developmental window during which
infection occurred. In Aim 3, we will relate these immunologic parameters to clinical sequelae and the
resolution of viremia during infancy in order to identify immune correlates of viral containment. Understanding
how variability in the infant immune response to CMV relates to clinical and virologic outcomes, and how age-
related differences in this immune response enable the gradual resolution of viremia postnatally, could lend
great insight into antiviral T cell function in early life."
10768750,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is one of the most important causes of infectious complications following hematopoietic
cell transplantation (HCT). Letermovir is an effective antiviral and was recently approved for prophylaxis to
prevent CMV reactivation after HCT. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis has advanced alongside
CMV prophylaxis, but the effects of novel GVHD therapies on infectious complications and immune reconstitution
patterns are unclear. Current data suggest that modern GVHD prophylaxis with post-transplantation
cyclophosphamide and sirolimus may offer an immunologic advantage over traditional prophylaxis with
calcineurin inhibitors. In this proposal, Dr. Zamora will prospectively examine how these GVHD prophylaxis
strategies influence CMV-specific T-cell and humoral immunity after HCT, and how these immunological
changes can affect overall clinical outcomes.
In the first aim of this proposal, Dr. Zamora will examine the effects of viral, host, and transplantation factors,
including GVHD prophylaxis, on polyfunctional CMV-specific cellular immune reconstitution. He will use
advanced analytical methods to compute polyfunctional T-cell responses and compare differences in immune
responses between GVHD prophylaxis regimens. Dr. Zamora will also compare the accuracy of these analytical
methods, versus traditional methods of measuring polyfunctionality, in predicting late clinically significant CMV
infection after HCT. Furthermore, he will study the immunologic influence of regulatory T cells on the
development of polyfunctional T-cell immune reconstitution after HCT and investigate whether this may be
affected by the presence or absence of CMV reactivation.
Historically, humoral immunity was not felt to be important in CMV prevention after HCT; however, recent animal
studies have challenged this notion. Therefore, in the second aim Dr. Zamora will characterize factors influencing
functional CMV-specific humoral immune reconstitution after HCT, using state-of-the-art neutralizing antibody
and cell-to-cell spread inhibition assays. He will also evaluate the kinetics of CMV-specific antibody responses
at the epitope level, using a novel serological profiling technology that can detect antibody responses to
thousands of pathogen epitopes (VirScan). Dr. Zamora will investigate the associations of CMV-specific humoral
immunity, as measured by these novel immune platforms, with the prevention of late clinically significant CMV
reactivation after HCT.
Dr. Zamora aims to define CMV-specific T-cell and humoral immune reconstitution kinetics in the current era of
advanced GVHD prophylaxis regimens and effective antiviral prophylaxis. This study has the potential to define
immunologic parameters to optimize CMV prophylaxis strategies and provide the basis for novel immunotherapy
and immune monitoring approaches."
10768921,"OVERALL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This is a revised competitive renewal application for a Program focused on high-risk neuroblastoma (NB), a
diverse and enigmatic malignancy arising from the developing sympathetic nervous system that remains lethal
in 50% of patients despite intensive multi-modal therapy. The primary goal of this multi-institutional and multi-
disciplinary Program is to achieve improved outcomes for patients with high-risk NB by 1) discovering basic
mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance to modern therapies; 2) uncovering targetable vulnerabilities
driving resistance; and 3) translating these insights into evidence-based clinical trials. The Program has been
productive, with important basic, translational, and clinical research achievements over the past 5.5 years. The
basic structure of the Program remains the same, with four Projects focusing on interrelated fundamental
problems in the broad fields of epigenomics, tumor microenvironment, and immuno-oncology. The central
hypothesis is that high-risk NBs evolve to evade therapeutic interventions but that these resistance
mechanisms can be targeted therapeutically. The motivation for the proposed research is the urgent need to
improve survival of patients with high-risk NB, and to decrease treatment-related morbidities. The four proposed
Projects will each address the three Specific Aims of the overall Program: 1) discover mechanisms of NB
therapy resistance; 2) discover tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic therapeutic vulnerabilities imparted by therapy
resistance; and 3) develop readily translatable therapeutic strategies to exploit de novo and acquired
resistance mechanisms and molecular vulnerabilities. The Projects will each be supported by two Cores: A)
Administrative core; B) Translational, statistical, and clinical trials core. Unique to the Program is the New
Approaches to NB Therapy (NANT) consortium integrated into Core B now in its 22nd year. A major goal of the
NANT is to prioritize new therapies from our Projects for Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in the high-risk NB relapse
population, with the goal of moving these to Phase 3 testing in newly diagnosed patients. The Program is
responsible for the two targeted investigational agents currently being tested in an ongoing Children’s
Oncology Group Phase 3 trial. The NANT also provides a unique resource of therapy resistant tumors and
other biospecimens for Project investigators. Importantly, all Projects have clear milestones to deliver one or
more clinical trial to the NANT, with Project specific studies designed to provide the portfolio of nonclinical data
required for efficient translation to the refractory NB patient population. This highly integrated Program
proposes a variety of innovative experimental strategies to uncover basic mechanisms of oncogenesis and
therapy resistance, but is steadfastly translational, as the investigative team is constituted of physicians who
care for children with this disease. The significance of the proposed Program is the continued discovery of
fundamental mechanisms of cancer therapy resistance leading to substantively improved probability of cure
coupled with reduced therapy-related morbidity for children, adolescents and adults afflicted with high-risk NB."

The purpose of the Recombinant Virus Core C is to generate quality controlled recombinant herpesviruses for
KSHV, EBV, and MHV68 (Projects 1, 2 and 3). The services of Core C will continue to aid the overall goal of
the program project to comprehensively analyze the role of herpesvirus non-coding RNAs as well as studies on
host cellular lncRNAs that are perturbed in response to viral infection. In addition to constructing recombinant
viruses, Core C will perform genome-wide sequencing of viral mutants. Building upon years of experience in
making a complete set of KSHV miRNA deletion mutants, our group has developed and implemented techniques
for making bacmid-derived mutants in both KSHV and MHV68, and more recently also EBV. During the first
funding period we designed, created and quality controlled more than 60 recombinant herpesviruses. Additional
services and innovations are target enriched re-sequencing of latently infected producer cell lines for EBV and
KSHV and applying innovative CRISPR technologies for mutagenesis."

IMSD at Texas A&M University: Initiative for Maximizing Student Diversity in Biomedical Sciences
This proposal is to establish a new IMSD T32 program at Texas A&M University. The overall mission of this
program is to maximize student diversity in biomedical sciences at Texas A&M by focusing on recruitment and
retention of underrepresented minority (URM) populations of trainees seeking a PhD degree who have the skills
to successfully transition into careers in the biomedical research workforce. Funds are requested to support six
pre-doctoral (Ph.D. candidates) URM trainees who are applying to one of the six major biomedical graduate
training programs at Texas A&M University: Medical Sciences, Biomedical Sciences, Genetics, Toxicology,
Biochemistry & Biophysics, and Biomedical Engineering. Texas A&M University will match NIH support with six
additional fellowships. This program will serve as a hub for unifying training-oriented diversity initiatives in
biomedical fields and establish a community of URM scholars at Texas A&M. Trainees will benefit from didactic,
research, mentoring and career development elements offered by the existing training programs, and from the
new initiatives focused specifically on this cohort of URM scholars. Our goal is to prepare trainees to function as
independent researchers and/or practitioners in a multidisciplinary setting by providing training in classroom-,
laboratory- and externship-based settings. To achieve this goal we have assembled a team of 40 outstanding
investigators who specialize in diverse biomedical fields. The program will be led by an executive committee of
co-PIs representing Office of Graduate & Professional Studies and participating Colleges (Medicine, Veterinary
Medicine, Engineering, and Agriculture & Life Sciences). The preceptors have strong records of mentoring URM
trainees and obtaining competitive support from Federal, State and other sources. This group is exceptionally
well balanced with respect to expertise, sex, and academic career level. Internal and external oversight will be
provided by eminent scholars with first-hand knowledge of diversity experiences in biomedical training and
employment. Recruitment will be conducted through external advertisement, post-baccalaureate diversity
programs, as well as Texas A&M research experience for undergraduates and masters programs. Support from
this program will be offered only in the first year of the doctoral program at the time when trainees undertake
two laboratory rotations, follow structured core academic curricula of their respective graduate programs, and
participate in regular joint activities as a group. A distinctive feature of the program is a strongly encouraged
hands-on summer (in the 1st year) externship through a broad and diverse network of academic laboratories,
state and federal governmental agencies, as well as industry and non-governmental organizations. Following
the first year, trainee support will shift to their graduate program, mentor, or other funding; however, trainees will

10769567,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cannabis consumption during pregnancy and lactation has reached 7-15% in pregnant women and nursing
mothers in recent years, and will likely rise due to widespread legalization. Increased availability of cannabis has
led to the public perception that it is a safe natural remedy for pregnancy-related ailments and postpartum mood
disorders. Yet, growing clinical and preclinical data suggest prenatal and perinatal cannabis exposure is
associated with long-term neurodevelopmental consequences in children, including sensorimotor, emotional,
and cognitive deficits, as well as increased risk for illicit drug use in adolescence and adulthood. The neural
mechanisms and sensitive periods underlying these long-term effects are still poorly understood, making it
challenging to provide accurate medical advice for risk assessment of cannabis use in mothers. To address this
challenge, our overall goal is to identify the developmental processes and circuit-specific mechanisms
underlying the effects of early-life cannabinoid exposure on the emergence of cognitive behaviors. We
will focus on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) due to its high levels of cannabinoid receptor expression during
development, and its critical role in cognitive processing. We will assess the circuit and network effects of early-
life exposure to the two most widely used and frequently combined cannabinoids, 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
and cannabidiol (CBD), in mouse pups across development. We will test the central hypothesis that early-life
cannabinoid exposure disrupts mPFC maturation by interfering with network synchronization during a
critical developmental window, resulting in abnormal neuronal activation during cognitive behaviors in
adolescence and adulthood. We will leverage our novel longitudinal 2-photon imaging technique in developing
mice to assess the impact of THC, CBD, and THC+CBD exposure through three aims. In Aim 1, we will reveal
the spatial and temporal patterns of in vivo network activity and eCB dynamics across development and
determine critical windows during which altered eCB signaling affects these network dynamics. In Aim 2, we will
assess how early-life THC, CBD, or THC+CBD exposure impacts eCB and calcium dynamics during
development using longitudinal 2-photon imaging. We will also examine the effects of cannabinoid exposure on
synaptic connectivity and the balance between excitation and inhibition in the mPFC. In Aim 3, we will assess
the impact of early-life cannabinoid exposure on the neural correlates of cognitive behaviors in the mPFC across
adolescence and adulthood. We will also systematically assess the behavioral outcomes after early-life
cannabinoid exposure longitudinally across neonatal, adolescence and early adulthood. Together, outcomes of
this project will identify neural mechanisms underlying later-life behavioral deficits as a result of early-life
cannabinoid exposure. As such, this project is expected to have a significant translational impact on clinical
efforts to provide guidelines on cannabis use in mothers and timely interventions for affected children."

 RESEARCH: The goal of this proposal is to refine and pilot test Asthma Link, an innovative, low-
cost intervention that links pediatric practices, schools, and families to deliver school nurse-supervised
asthma therapy to children with poorly controlled asthma in real-world settings. While there are successful
examples of school-supervised asthma therapy to improve asthma medication adherence in research
settings, this intervention has not been routinely adopted in practice. This is likely due to costly and
resource intense protocols that have not yet leveraged the established infrastructure of the clinical system
and schools. To address this, our team developed a new model, Asthma Link, in which pediatric providers
identify eligible children as part of their routine practice and initiate supervised asthma therapy with the
school nurse; the family picks up and delivers the asthma medication to the school: and the school nurse
supervises daily asthma medication use. This intervention leverages established infrastructure and
requires minimal resources to operate, enhancing sustainability in a real-world setting. Our preliminary
studies show that Asthma Link reduces asthma-related emergency room visits yet qualitative interviews
showed the protocol needs refinement for real-world use. We propose to refine the Asthma Link protocol for
real-world implementation and then pilot test the refined protocol in a cluster RCT of 4 pediatric practices (n=72
parent-child dyads). If proven to be effective, Asthma Link could become the standard of care for children
with high-risk asthma, with the power to transform practice, even within limited resources.

 This revised K08 proposal will complete Graham Brady, MD, PhD's training toward his goal of improving
our understanding and treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Dr. Brady is a physician and
scientist in hepatology at the University of Michigan with clinical expertise in liver disease, graduate training in
cell biology and biochemistry, and established success in the field of NAFLD. This proposal builds on Dr.
Brady's prior experience, with new training in genomics, bioinformatics, and a unique model organism
(zebrafish). His existing expertise and newly-acquired skills will be integrated to advance our understanding of
the scope and mechanisms of nuclear lamina-related NAFLD. The research will be conducted under the
guidance of primary mentor Bishr Omary, MD, PhD, and co-mentors Liz Speliotes, MD, PhD, MPH, and Jordan
Shavit, MD, PhD, with Jun Li, PhD, as a collaborator, who have expertise in NAFLD, genomics, zebrafish, and
extensive mentoring success. The 5-year career development plan includes formal coursework, professional
development, and mentored research, with defined milestones to ensure productivity and a successful
transition to independence.
 The estimated global prevalence of NAFLD is now ~25%, but medical therapies are limited in number and
efficacy, partly due to incomplete understanding of its pathogenesis. A unique group of patients with mutations
in genes encoding nuclear lamina components develop early-onset NAFLD that often progresses to
steatohepatitis (NASH) with cirrhosis. Mechanisms of NAFLD/NASH due to nuclear lamina mutations are
obscure, but their study may provide insights into NAFLD pathogenesis and avenues for future therapies. This
proposal will test the hypothesis that genetic alteration of the nuclear lamina predisposes to NAFLD/NASH by
altering nuclear protein organization and the transcriptome. The mentored research has two Specific Aims:
  AIM 1: Identify and validate variants in nuclear lamina-related genes in NAFLD/NASH cohorts.
  AIM 2: Establish new experimental models to study how LMNA variants alter the nuclear lamina,
 heterochromatin, and transcriptome to promote NAFLD/NASH.
 In completing these aims, Dr. Brady will analyze genomic data linked to electronic medical record data in
unique NAFLD cohorts and develop new disease models that will provide mechanistic insights into lamina-
related NAFLD and in vivo systems for drug screening. This will build to two R01 proposals: (1) to examine the
mechanistic basis of NAFLD-associated variants identified in AIM 1 and (2) to examine the mechanisms and
therapeutic potential of screened compounds in the models generated in AIM 2. In addition to building a
foundation for a programmatic line of research to understand the role of the nuclear envelope in liver disease,
this K08 will provide Dr. Brady with research skills applicable to additional domains of hepatology and
genomics and equip him to establish himself as an independent investigator and leader in this field."

Despite the emergence novel therapeutic modalities, including BRAF inhibitors and immunotherapies, over
7,100 people are expected to die each year from malignant melanoma, primarily from metastatic dissemination
and therapy resistance. The proposed studies leverage the expertise of the two co-PIs in tumor
microenvironment, the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) and melanoma progression to test the overall
hypothesis that as part of the adaptive response to tumor microenvironmental (TME) stress, bi-directional
interactions between melanoma cells and fibroblasts, endothelial cells and adipocytes promote survival,
metastatic dissemination, and therapy resistance. Preliminary results and published reports from the two PIs
indicate that the ISR is activated in human melanomas and that genetic or pharmacological disruption of the
ISR severely impairs primary tumor growth and metastasis in multiple experimental tumors, including
melanomas. The studies will delineate the salient roles of the transcription factor ATF4, a major transcriptional
effector of the Integrated Stress Response, in a pro-survival and pro-metastatic program mediated by the non-
canonical tumor suppressor BRN2, a transcription factor effector of multiple melanoma-associated signaling
pathways. To test the central hypothesis, we will pursue three specific aims: In Aim 1 we will use a novel,
conditional global ATF4 knockout mouse model, as well as Fibroblast (FB)-specific and Endothelial (EC)-
specific ATF4 knockout mice and cells to determine the role of ATF4 expression in each TME component on
melanoma progression and metastasis. Preliminary results with global or FB-specific deletion of ATF4 results
in a severe deficiency in tumor growth of flank melanoma tumors. In Aim 2 we will study how SRC promotes
melanoma progression via ATF4-BRN2 cooperativity. Both BRN2 and ATF4 can repress anoikis/apoptosis,
and in preliminary studies we reveal that BRN2 interacts with ATF4. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis that
Extracellular Matrix (ECM)-driven integrin signaling, and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) uptake from
adipocytes and lymph converge on SRC to impose a cooperative BRN2-ATF4 anti-apoptotic and pro-
metastasis gene expression program, driven in part by hippo signaling. Finally, under Aim 3, we will determine
how MUFAs dictate melanoma phenotype. Here we will dissect a novel mechanism underpinning MUFA-
mediated nuclear localization of -catenin and test the hypothesis that the resulting SRC-driven nuclear CAV1-
-catenin complex promotes a pro-metastasis gene expression program via BRN2-ATF4, and the contribution
of ATF4 and BRN2 to melanoma phenotypic heterogeneity and tumor immune infiltration. By delineating how
the ISR uses ATF4 to coordinate the output of the TME to shape melanoma progression, we will identify
therapeutically exploitable pathways for anti-melanoma approaches."

Recent developments in artificial intelligence and neuroscience have revealed neural codes for reinforcement
that represent predictions of a range of possible future reward outcomes, rather than a singular expected value.
This distributional reinforcement learning has enabled improved performance of artificial agents and has
straightforward implications for numerous neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly impulse control and substance
use disorders. This proposal aims to leverage our experience recording neuronal activity from the brains of
human neurosurgical patients in order to translate these recordings in a novel research direction: to understand
the mechanisms of human choice behavior. We will determine where distributional codes exist in the human
prefrontal and mesial temporal cortices, and how those codes are expressed dynamically in time as humans
make impulsive choices during the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) and a probabilistic reversal learning task.
The results of these experiments will have both important basic scientific implications and will begin to address
how distributional reinforcement learning in the human brain contributes to impulsive choices.
In order to begin translating this new area of knowledge to understand the underpinnings of human decisions,
we will first establish the presence of distributional reinforcement learning in four brain areas that comprise a
human decision-making circuit: Orbitofrontal Cortex, Anterior Cingulate Cortex, Amygdala, and Hippocampus.
Specific Aim 1 will test the three essential predictions of distributional RL: whether populations of neurons in
each of these brain areas exhibit 1) asymmetric scaling of reward prediction errors, 2) diverse reversal points,
and 3) that prediction error asymmetries and reversal points correlate across neurons. Specific Aim 2 seeks to
decode BART reward prediction distributions from neurons in the aforementioned brain areas and determine
how changes in BART reward distributions correlate with the propensity to make impulsive choices. Specific
Aim 3 will test how diversity in optimism and pessimism in each neuron recorded from the aforementioned brain
areas correlates with valuation or devaluation across trials.
The completion of these aims will constitute important basic research findings in discovering distributional RL in
the human prefrontal and mesial temporal cortices. By uncovering neural population codes that underlie
potentially impulsive choices in human decision-making circuits, these experiments also address fundamental
neural mechanisms underlying impulsive choices. This issue is central to addressing important problems for
contemporary mental health including substance use disorder and a many other neuropsychiatric disorders.
These findings will have readily translatable implications for improving targeted electrical therapies for psychiatric
disorders."
10771187,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Obesity increases risk for 13 types of cancer and now affects over 40% of the U.S. adult population, with even
higher prevalence among rural Americans. Most worrisome, the prevalence of class 3 obesity (BMI ≥ 40),
which contributes the highest cancer risk, is increasing at a rate 3 times higher in rural communities compared
to urban areas. Rural residents often lack access to weight control programs and food and physical activity
resources that promote healthy lifestyles, especially in small or remote rural areas. It is paramount that obesity
treatment be offered in rural primary care, especially to reach those who have Class 3 obesity and/or co-
morbid medical conditions who carry the highest obesity-related cancer risk. Medical management by a
primary care provider (PCP) during behavioral weight loss is essential to address co-morbid medical
conditions, evaluate obesogenic medications, and explore options for guideline-recommended
pharmacotherapy and surgical treatment. However, there has been a missed opportunity in primary care-
based obesity treatment trials for capitalizing on guideline-based medical management. The current trial builds
on lessons learned in our recently completed RE-POWER trial conducted in rural primary care clinics, which
demonstrated significantly greater weight loss with in-clinic group visits versus individual visits, and highlighted
the need for medical management by the local PCPs. RE-TOOL (Rural Engagement in TelemedTeam for
Options in Obesity Treatment SoLutions) is a cluster RCT (n = 16 clinics and 560 participants) designed to
enhance sustainable access to obesity treatment in rural communities. TelemedTeam is a novel team-based
telemedicine approach that pairs intensive telemedicine group visits with quarterly individual team-based clinic
visits that simultaneously engage the patient, the local PCP, and the lifestyle coach to help activate the patient.
This novel collaborative telemedicine solution combines the benefits of group-based treatment with home-
based telemedicine delivery, and critically, integrates team-based care in local rural clinics to capitalize on the
importance of medical management and access to local support and resources. The primary hypothesis is that
TelemedTeam will result in greater % weight loss at 24 months compared to Enhanced Usual Care
consisting of quarterly PCP visits only. Secondary outcomes include the proportion achieving ≥5% and 10%
weight loss, diet quality, physical activity, quality of life, and medical treatment process outcomes. Exploratory
analyses will assess reach, adoption, and implementation and investigate rural sociocultural and spatial
predictors of treatment effects."
10771191,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 800,000 deaths each year.1,2
Suicide rates continue to increase in the U.S.3 Most research on suicide risk factors has identified static,
dispositional factors.4 These data inform us about groups at actuarial risk, but do very little to predict with useful
precision when people will have suicidal thoughts or act on suicide thoughts. Thus, there is an urgent need to
identify proximal risk factors for suicide risk.
 Two of the leading factors distally associated with increased suicide risk are dysfunctional emotional
responses5 and decision-making deficits.6 Suicidal individuals have poorer reinforcement learning,6,7
demonstrating impaired ability to learn and modify behavior in response to reward and punishment. Individuals
at high risk for suicide (i.e., borderline personality disorder) also show difficulties learning from punishment and
reward,8,9 and the PI’s data show that negative emotions uniquely impair learning in such high-risk populations
relative to healthy and clinical controls.10 It is necessary to understand the interactive effects of emotion and
reinforcement learning as factors elevating near-term risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
 Therefore, the proposed study examines both emotional and cognitive processes associated with suicidal
thoughts and behaviors among 170 patients with a range of suicidal risk recently treated in an emergency
department for a suicidal crisis. Using innovative ecological momentary assessment methods (EMA), the
proposed study will examine behavioral measures of reinforcement learning and both physiological and
subjective measures of momentary emotions. Aim 1 identifies the main and interactive effects of emotional
responses, reinforcement learning, and emotion-related decrements in learning on recent suicidal thoughts and
behaviors among suicidal patients recently seen in the emergency department. Aim 2 examines how emotions
and learning interact to predict momentary suicidal thoughts and behaviors over four weeks. Aim 3 tests emotion-
related decrements in learning as prospective predictors of future suicide risk over a six-month follow-up.
 The research team (PI: Dixon-Gordon, Co-Is: Ammerman, Boudreaux, Rathlev; Consultants: Hackel;
Collaborator: Laws) has access to world-class expertise, with extensive experience recruiting suicidal
participants from medical settings, EMA, computational modeling, and experimental psychopathology.
 The most important challenge facing suicide prevention today is unraveling the complex emotional and
cognitive proximal drivers that transform nascent suicide risk into action. Combining state-of-the-art behavioral
measures and EMA, we will tease apart the complex longitudinal relations between dysfunctional emotional
responses, reduced capacity to learn from reward and punishment, and fluctuations in suicidal thoughts and
behaviors. Given the high societal costs of suicide, this work has important health significance. Findings will
inform the development of treatments that target emotion dysfunction and learning in samples at-risk for suicide."
10771233,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY
Glucose homeostasis is tightly controlled in animals with plasma glucose levels maintained in a narrow range.
While insulin, secreted by the beta cell, regulates by promoting efficient glucose disposal and suppressing
glucose release from the liver when glucose levels rise, glucagon, secreted by the alpha cells, counterregulates
by facilitating glucose release from the liver through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis when levels fall.
Epinephrine, cortisol and growth hormone play supporting roles in glucose counterregulation. Impaired
counterregulatory responses can lead to hypoglycemia, a potentially fatal condition. Hypoglycemia is frequently
experienced by type 1 and late-stage type 2 diabetics, which limits the use of aggressive therapies in disease
management. The etiology of this impaired counterregulation is not well understood. On the other hand, alpha
cell dysfunction (impaired inhibition of glucagon secretion by glucose) leads to elevated fasting glucose levels
and diminished early suppression of glucagon after glucose challenge. This form of impairment exacerbates type
2 diabetes and may contribute to its development and progression. I propose to study both forms of impairment.
In oral glucose tolerance tests, diminished early suppression of glucagon followed by greater late glucagon
suppression is observed in type 2 diabetics. This leads to worsened hyperglycemia followed by hypoglycemia.
If the mechanism behind persistent glucagon suppression and delayed recovery is fully elucidated, it would be
possible to protect against hypoglycemic events. I propose to explore the different mechanisms of somatostatin
and GLP-1 mediated regulation of glucagon secretion by extending the parsimonious model of glucose-insulin-
glucagon dynamics I developed. Reactive Hypoglycemia (RHG) occurs a few hours after ingesting a
carbohydrate rich meal. Plasma glucose levels drop below 55 mg/dl and the patient displays neuroglycopenic
symptoms which are relieved by glucose ingestion. There is currently no definitive explanation for this behavior.
I will extend the glucose-insulin-glucagon minimal model I developed to include the other hormones and validate
the model with data from OGTT studies of patients with RHG. I will also investigate the role of insulin in
potentiating RHG. An overarching question in type 2 diabetes pathophysiology is the nature of disease
progression from normal through prediabetic to overt diabetic state. The critical role of alpha cell dysfunction in
disease development and progression has not yet been studied. I will interface the glucose-insulin-glucagon
model I developed with existing disease progression models. This will identify the role of alpha cell dysfunction
and glucagon action in development and acceleration of type 2 diabetes. I will study the etiology of hypoglycemia
in aims 1 and 2 and the impact of alpha cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes through longitudinal modeling of
disease progression in aim 3."
10772929,"Antihypertensive and statin therapy represent imminently scalable interventions for preventing Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias (ADRD). Evidence from randomized trials for the effect of these medications on
preventing ADRD provided mixed results and has often been limited by short follow-up times, low statistical
power, and a lack of representativeness for the broader population and routine care. Using large-scale
electronic health record (EHR) data from three integrated health systems in the US as well as nation-wide data
from the UK and Denmark, this project will employ an innovative and well-validated method for causal effect
estimation to fill this evidence gap. Specifically, we will exploit thresholds in blood pressure, LDL, and
cardiovascular disease risk in clinical guidelines. Patients close to these thresholds are similar to each other
except that crossing a given threshold results in a sudden jump in the probability of receiving the medication.
Importantly, the validity of this approach can be fully verified in the data, including by comparing patients’
characteristics just above versus just below each threshold. Our datasets have follow-up times between 17 and
35 years, include detailed pharmacy records, and have minimal loss to follow-up due to complete linkage of all
US datasets to Medicare claims data and the single-provider nature of the UK and Danish health system.
Generated as part of an NIH New Innovator Award to the PI, our extensive preliminary analyses demonstrate
that this innovative approach in EHR data is both feasible and valid and that all key variables are reliably
recorded in our EHR datasets. Our approach in EHR data has also successfully replicated findings from clinical
trials on the effect of antihypertensive and statin therapy on cardiovascular disease events, giving us a high
degree of confidence that we can extend our approach to ADRD. Bringing together a team with deep expertise
in ADRD, causal inference, and EHR data, we will establish the causal effect of antihypertensive (Aim 1) and
statin (Aim 2) therapy on the incidence of ADRD. Aim 3 will determine whether antihypertensive and statin
prescriptions have adverse behavioral effects, which is critical knowledge for interpreting findings (regardless
of their direction) in Aims 1 and 2. All analyses will ascertain the causal effects both of receiving a prescription
and of long-term adherence to these medications, use novel machine-learning approaches to determine how
effects vary across detailed patient subgroups, and be compared to more common analytical approaches that
make stronger assumptions than our threshold-based method. Although validation studies have generally
found the reliability of ADRD diagnoses in our EHR datasets to be high, we will also conduct extensive
probabilistic bias analyses for potential under- and overdiagnosis of ADRD. This project will inform clinical and
public health guidelines as well as directions for the development of new ADRD preventive interventions. In
demonstrating the value of our approach, this project could also encourage efforts in EHR data that exploit
threshold-based decision making in other areas of medicine."
10749893,"Abstract. The glycopeptide antibiotics are the most important class of drugs used in the treatment of resistant
bacterial infections, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In fact, even after 60 years of clinical use,
vancomycin administration in the clinic is still steadily increasing. Consequently, the emergence of resistant
Gram-positive pathogens including vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) and vancomycin-resistant S.
aureus (VRSA) presents a serious public health problem at a time few new antibiotics are being developed.
These two pathogens rank 4th and 5th on the WHO global priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria for which
there is an urgent need for new treatments. The only clinically significant mechanism of vancomycin resistance
is its induced late stage remodeling of the bacterial cell wall precursor termini from D-Ala-D-Ala (the target of
vancomycin) to D-Ala-D-Lac. Objectives of the work have included the redesign of vancomycin for dual D-Ala-D-
Ala and D-Ala-D-Lac binding capable of treating both sensitive and vancomycin-resistant bacterial infections and
directly addressing the underlying molecular basis of vancomycin resistance. The exciting results with binding
pocket analogs designed for dual D-Ala-D-Ala/D-Lac binding and subsequently with their peripherally modified
derivatives that incorporate synergistic second and third mechanisms of action (MOAs) independent of D-Ala-D-
Ala/D-Lac binding chart a compelling path forward for the development of potent and especially durable
antibiotics not prone to eliciting resistance for treatment of deadly vancomycin-resistant and multidrug-resistant
bacterial infections. The studies in the last grant period have produced analogs worthy of comprehensive
preclinical evaluation and the challenges for the work have returned to those of their preparation. This is an area
where the PI and his group are well equipped and excited to address. The proposed studies will improve access
to the analogs through development of an innovative next generation total synthesis or semisynthetic approach,
and lay a foundation for fermentation access to the pocket modified glycopeptide antibiotics. The immediate
target of the next generation synthetic studies, which are at an advanced stage, is the synthesis of an analog
that is projected to be the most active compound in the series examined to date, bearing the most effective
pocket modification and two key peripheral modifications. A well-conceived stereochemical simplification in the
target structures will also be examined that will substantially improve synthetic access to the aglycon core
structure without compromising antimicrobial activity. Optimization of activity derived from a new, third MOA
discovered in the last grant period will be conducted and such efforts have already improved on the impressive
activity reported to date. In vivo assessments of key compounds will be conducted that build on the stunning
results to date, structural characterization of pocket analogs bound to model ligands will be pursued to confirm
the fundamental basis of the remarkable dual D-Ala-D-Ala/D-Lac binding, and a breakthrough discovery for
achieving antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative as well as Gram-positive bacteria will be examined."
10749894,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the U.S and worldwide.
There are more than 400,000 deaths of lung cancer worldwide each year, among which lung squamous cell
carcinoma (LUSC) accounts for about 30%. However, no effective treatments for LUSC are available. LUSC is
one type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) characterized by numerous DNA alterations, including
frequent amplification of the 3q26 chromosomal segment. The 3q26 segment is noteworthy because it contains
the YEATS domain containing 2 (YEATS2) gene, a gene that is frequently amplified in a number of human
cancers, including LUSC (~50%), ovarian (28%), head and neck (25%), and esophagus cancers (25%). High
YEATS2 mRNA expression is associated with a poor prognosis of NSCLC patients, indicating that YEATS2
may have a tumor-promoting role.
YEATS2 is a stoichiometric subunit of the Ada-Two-A-Containing (ATAC) complex, a conserved metazoan
histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex. YEATS2 contains an evolutionally conserved YEATS domain. We
previously showed that the YEATS domain of YEATS2 functions as a reader of histone acetylation and other
types of histone acylation such as crotonylation. Importantly, disrupting the YEATS histone reading activity
impairs the normal functions of YEATS2 and the ATAC complex, resulting in reduced histone acetylation,
decreased target gene expression, and inhibition of cell growth and survival of NSCLC. These data
demonstrate that the YEATS domain of YEATS2 is a potential drug target, and that targeting YEATS2 may
provide a therapeutic approach for treating NSCLC and other types of cancer characterized by YEATS2
amplification.
The objective of this proposal is to develop potent and specific inhibitors targeting the histone acylation binding
activity of the YEATS domain of YEATS2. For this, we will (1) conduct a high-throughput screen to identify
YEATS2 small-molecule inhibitors, and (2) evaluate and characterize hit compounds in in vitro and cell-based
assays. Through the proposed studies, we expect to identify potent, specific YEATS2 YEATS domain chemical
probes of different chemotypes. These compounds will provide the basis for further development of small
molecules for targeted therapies. Likewise, the research community will be able to use these new inhibitors as
important tools to understand the functions and mechanisms of YEATS2 in human cancers."

Sleep apnea is a common and underdiagnosed syndrome that impacts at least 4% of American adults and
is associated with heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer mortality. In patients with sleep apnea,
arterial oxygen saturation intermittently falls. Cyclic episodes are typically followed by rapid re-oxygenation.
This cycle occurs as often as 60 times per hour, resulting in chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), a dynamic
physiology that is distinct from static hypoxia. Our lab is pioneering the study of CIH’s effects on the bone
marrow, immunity, and the development of hematological malignancies and we now propose the critical
studies necessary to translate our work to human patients. We propose that CIH can cause resistance to
chemotherapy by increasing the abundance of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). In this proposal, we
aim: Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that severity of nighttime chronic intermittent hypoxia promotes TAMs
burden Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment modulates
the abundance and gene expression of CD163+ CD206+ macrophages, and Aim 3: Test the hypothesis
that chronic intermittent hypoxia decreases the probability of complete remission in newly diagnosed
myeloma. By the end of the project period, we will have established that CIH has a clinically meaningful
impact on the bone marrow, we will have performed the first deep characterization of TAMs in the context of
CIH, and we will have determined the degree to which CIH severity is linked to poor response to
chemotherapy."
10749945,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Repeated major depressive episodes are particularly problematic for older adults who have a more brittle
recovery than younger adults. Our data show that, despite antidepressant treatment, almost 60% of remitted
older adults experience recurrence within four years. Beyond simply relying on past history and reported
current stress, it is unclear what neurobiological factors are prospectively associated with recurrence risk,
when these factors trigger recurrence, and how they contribute to the high rates of cognitive impairment
observed in late-life depression (LLD). Using a model of network homeostasis, we posit that depressive
episodes are characterized by disrupted homeostasis in key neural networks involved in affect regulation and
cognitive function. Our preliminary data indicate that treatment non-remitters have residual functional network
alterations and high network instability (higher fluctuations in temporal signal-to-noise ratio). We hypothesize
that remitters with residual functional network alterations and greater instability remain at high risk of
recurrence with subsequent stress exposure. This disequilibrium contributes to subsyndromal symptoms
followed by full recurrence. These processes may also contribute to the higher rate of cognitive impairment and
decline observed in LLD. Our groups have reported elevated rates of cognitive decline in remitted LLD and an
association of recurrence with accelerated brain aging. We hypothesize that greater neural reactivity to stress
may accelerate brain aging and cognitive decline and that deficits/variability in performance on tasks
dependent on ECN may serve as markers of network alterations and signal increased recurrence risk. The
goals of this study are to A) identify neurobiological factors that predict recurrence risk, and B) examine how
cognitive performance changes are both influenced by these same neurobiological factors and also predict
recurrence risk. Our approach is to conduct a three-site, two-year longitudinal study of remitted LLD and
never-depressed elders. Every 8 months we will conduct laboratory assessments, including clinical, cognitive
and neuroimaging assessments and an in-scanner stress paradigm, along with burst ecological momentary
assessments (EMA) of mood variability, stress exposure, cognitive performance, and passive actigraphy. As
an exploratory goal, we will examine whether continuous ecological monitoring of mood and activity can
provide early detection of recurrence. A subgroup will be continuously monitored by EMA and actigraphy for
state shifts (persistent worsening) or variance shifts (increased variability) in symptom severity. When shifts in
mood symptoms are identified, they will engage in ad-hoc clinical and neuroimaging testing. Results from this
study may be translated in clinical practice through the future development of easy-to-use platforms (e.g. apps)
that signal to clinicians increased risk of impending recurrence, thus allowing for swift therapeutic intervention."

 The healthy immune system depends upon a balance of proliferation and death of white
blood cells, including B and T lymphocytes, to contain and eliminate infectious pathogens
effectively without doing unintended damage to “self” tissues. I have a long-standing interest in
elucidating the molecular mechanisms responsible for maintaining immune homeostasis in
humans, focusing on B and T cells. One way that activated T cells are instructed to die occurs
upon repeated engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR); a process known as restimulation-
induced cell death (RICD). This self-regulatory death program protects against excessive
expansion of T cells as an immune response unfolds. The long-term objective of my research
program is to define specific biochemical signals that convert the TCR signal from
proliferation and survival to death, which remain incompletely understood.
 Our research is informed in part by investigating human immune disorders, caused by
single gene defects, that result in dysregulated immune homeostasis. We previously discovered
a novel RICD defect in T cells from patients with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP),
which lack expression of SLAM-associated protein (SAP). SAP is required for proper RICD in
normal T cells. Using a variety of genetic and biochemical approaches, we illuminated a
previously unrecognized network of biochemical signals connecting SAP, NTB-A, and key
kinases (e.g. LCK, DGKa), phosphatases (SHP-1), and transcription factors (FOXP3) that
regulate TCR signaling and ultimately govern RICD sensitivity in human conventional and
regulatory T cells. However, we also learned that several other signaling molecules independent
of this network control RICD. Moreover, we discovered that dynamic changes in cellular
metabolism also play a major role. Over the next five years, our research will be focused on
determining if and how specific co-inhibitory receptors, transcriptional regulators, and metabolic
circuits “tune” RICD susceptibility over the entire human T cell response, including early stages
of rapid T cell proliferation. Elucidating these critical signaling events will improve our basic
understanding of abnormal T cell signaling and cell death in patients with immune disorders
beyond XLP. Understanding these molecular interactions should offer new therapeutic targets to
control T cell responses by manipulating RICD sensitivity, which could be applied to numerous
clinical contexts in which culling excess T cells (e.g. autoimmunity, lymphoproliferative disease)
or boosting T cell responses (e.g. infection, vaccination, cancer) could help ameliorate disease."

 After the severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in China in 2002, the virus was
traced back to animal markets and several genetically related viruses were identified in bats. This early work
into coronavirus zoonosis and the concomitant rise of next generation sequencing technologies in the early
2000’s helped initiate global research efforts to identify viruses circulating in wildlife. The genomes for tens
of thousands of novel animal viruses have now been sequenced and deposited in online repositories.
Coronaviruses are abundant in mammals and birds and comprise approximately 25% of all bat viruses
discovered to date. The highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, and middle east respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are only representative members of their respective sarbeco- and
merbeco- subgenera, which encompass hundreds of related viruses found in bats and other wildlife,
worldwide. Unfortunately, because there are few tools available for researchers to study uncharacterized
animal viruses, virus discovery studies rarely isolate viruses under laboratory conditions or perform
experiments beyond genetic sequencing, leaving some of the most essential questions about these viruses –
including if they have the potential to infect humans – unanswered. An improved understanding for what
species these viruses can infect and how they invade the cells of their hosts is essential for future pandemic
preparedness.
 The most significant species barrier for the coronaviruses that have transmitted to humans is at the
level of cell entry and studies have shown that overcoming this barrier allows for coronaviruses to replicate in
cells from diverse species. To invade cells, the “spike” glycoprotein on the surface of viral particles binds to
host cell receptor molecules. The receptor binding domain (RBD) is a small region on the distal tip of the
spike protein, capable of folding independently of spike and contains all amino acids that contact the host
receptor. We previously developed “SarbecoType” – a BSL2-compatible, viral pseudotype-based platform to
functionally screen the cell entry properties of the RBD from any sarbecovirus. This approach is highly cost-
efficient and scalable, requiring synthesis of only a small portion of the spike gene, and has allowed us to
characterize the cell entry phenotypes of approximately 95% of all published sarbecoviruses. This dataset
identified multiple clades of sarbecovirus RBDs that vary in their zoonotic properties for humans, and has
formed a foundational basis for ongoing universal sarbecovirus design. Therefore, we hypothesize
uncharacterized coronaviruses pose a threat to humans. Here we propose to functionally screen the much
larger and diverse group of merbecoviruses with similar methods (I.e., “MerbecoType”) and use this entry
data to predict the entry capabilities of novel sarbeco- and merbeco-virus sequences."

The consortium Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism: Stress and Chronic Alcohol Interactions
(a.k.a. INIAstress) is a collection of highly integrative and innovative projects and cores. The overarching
goal of INIAstress is elucidating the changes in brain circuitry and mechanisms that underlie how chronic
alcohol alters response to stress, which in turn can facilitate the transition from moderate/social drinking to
heavy/hazardous drinking and associated problems. The consortium has defined factors that contribute to an
individual's risk for the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD), revealed underlying mechanisms and
conditions that promote excessive and harmful drinking, and forged progress towards discovering more effective
and tailored treatment strategies. In the next renewal, the overarching goal of the INIAstress Consortium is to
apply cutting-edge technologies towards elucidating mechanisms of neural adaptation in key brain circuitry that
underlie how alcohol and stress interact to facilitate a trajectory toward excessive drinking, a negative emotional
state, cognitive (executive) function deficits, and harmful abstinence/relapse cycles. Through this knowledge the
consortium will advance personalized medicine approaches to facilitate recovery from AUD and, in particular,
stress-related excessive alcohol consumption. Collectively, these collaborative, cross-species studies directly
integrate behavioral, endocrine, neural, and genetic data within a scope of expertise and thematic inquiry
that would not be possible using more traditional grant mechanisms. As the lead application, the
Administrative Resource Core will provide scientific leadership on the consortium's main goals and serve as
a centralized administrative structure to facilitate and coordinate the overall management, direction and
integration of research activities within the INIAstress Consortium."

Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatocyte fat accumulation in the absence of
alcoholic or viral etiologies, and is part of a spectrum of disease ranging from isolated steatosis to
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD is estimated to affect nearly one-quarter of the world's population. As
the incidence of NAFLD-associated HCC has risen rapidly over the past few decades, it has become clear that
NAFLD is an emerging public health crisis for which there is currently no approved pharmacologic intervention.
This project will investigate the role of AKR1a1—a recently discovered protein denitrosylase—in the
pathogenesis of NAFLD through interrogation of its role in modulating hepatic lipid metabolism via reversible S-
nitrosylation of key lipogenic enzymes. Further, the potential for AKR1a1 as a novel therapeutic target to
prevent NAFLD will be investigated. To this end, the study will employ a variety of techniques including:
CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and administration of small molecule inhibitors in dietary models of murine
NAFLD; isotope tracing studies to interrogate whole-pathway and enzyme-specific effects on lipid metabolism;
resin-assisted capture to assess endogenous S-nitrosylation of enzymes; and site-directed mutagenesis to
determine the functional role of S-nitrosylation. Together, this study will provide novel insight into the regulation
of hepatic lipid metabolism and the pathophysiology of NAFLD, and identify potential therapeutic targets."

 The number of cancer healthcare providers and researchers is not expected to keep pace with the aging
population of the United States, creating an imperative to educate and motivate the next generation of cancer
professionals. Experiential research laboratory internships have been shown to be an impactful way to
incentivize students toward careers in cancer research, but often such programs are limited in number and
scope, thus impeding their potential to influence undergraduate course selection and long-term career goals.
Moreover, such experiences do not emphasize critical ancillary skills, such as scientific literacy, designing and
presenting posters and seminars, and networking. The Fox Chase Cancer Center-University of Delaware
Summer Fellowship Program seeks to provide twelve underclassmen with a residential, intensive 10-week
summer internship focused on basic laboratory skill acquisition, a cancer research experience tailored to the
student's interests, and complementary training and guidance in professional development. Students will be
recruited to this program via an introductory, day-long exposure to the Center, which will include brief research
laboratory rotations and discussion of cancer-focused, STEM-based careers; this introductory visit is open to all
University of Delaware students in the College of Arts and Sciences. Metrics of programmatic success will be
obtained through weekly meetings with mentors and students, pre- and post-internship evaluations, and long-
term tracking of student career decisions. Through this program, we aim to incorporate students into the cancer
research community, inspire them to pursue careers that are critical in the ongoing battle against cancer, and
equip them with the tools required to succeed as professionals."

Most older adults experience changes in immune system function which lead to chronic elevations in
inflammation biomarkers. Chronic inflammation leads to elevated risk of many age-related disorders, including
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); however, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. There is
a higher burden of both ADRD and chronic inflammation in African American populations, likely in large part
due to social determinants of health (SDOH) and psychosocial stress. Pro-inflammatory innate and adaptive
circulating immune cells, and inflammation related genes in these cell types, may be associated with an
increased risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia among community-dwelling older African
Americans. We propose to characterize the circulating proportions of monocytes, T and B cell, and innate
lymphocytes (>50 cellular phenotypes) and gene expression in immune cells in ~1440 African American
participants enrolled in the well-characterized population-based Jackson Heart Study, using samples collected
and stored at the upcoming Exam 4 (2021-2023). We will then evaluate associations of immune cells and
inflammation pathway gene expression with age, psychosocial stress and SDOH, plasma biomarkers of
Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based neurodegeneration and
cerebrovascular disease measures, and MCI and dementia status. We will examine these relationships both
cross-sectionally and longitudinally, using previously funded RNA-sequencing and immune phenotyping data
at the Jackson Heart Study baseline exam, and assess differences by sex, given known sex differences in
immune system function. We hypothesize that pro-inflammatory cell types and transcripts will be associated
with MCI, dementia, and its risk factors and that inflammation may statistically mediate associations between
higher psychosocial stress/SDOH burden and risk of MCI/dementia. We will also use data from immune cells
to identify putative target genes and biological mechanisms for dementia risk variants, especially for variants
more common in African versus European ancestry populations. This study is responsive to PAR-19-070
(NOT-AG-18-047: Health Disparities and Alzheimer’s Disease), as well as the January 2021 NIA approved
concept calling for increased study of adaptive immunity in ADRD. It will add unique immune function and RNA
sequencing data to one of the largest ongoing cohort studies of aging African American adults, with
longitudinal phenotyping available since 2000. The generated data will be made widely available to the
scientific community through appropriate public repositories (such as dbGaP) and can be used to address how
immune cells and their gene expression influence risk of both dementia and other important disease outcomes
in aging African Americans, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Identification of specific and non-invasive
inflammation biomarkers associated with MCI and dementia risk will improve understanding of disease biology
and inform selection of putative anti-inflammatory therapeutics for ADRD."

The availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has markedly reduced leading causes of HIV-related mortality
and morbidity in Africa, including tuberculosis (TB). Yet TB remains the leading cause of death among people
with HIV. Use of TB preventive therapy (TPT) reduces TB incidence and death, even among people receiving
ART. Although the benefits of TPT among people with HIV have been known for 30 years and international
and national guidelines provide clear prescribing recommendations, TPT is poorly prescribed. Overall in low
and middle income countries 10-30% of people with HIV eligible for TPT receive it. For those who do receive
TPT along with ART, adherence is generally good. Multiple system and provider level barriers appear to be
driving anemic TPT prescribing. Several of these barriers have caused TPT prescribing to be the exception
rather that the routine – barriers based on complex procedures implemented for inaccurate concerns. Primary
among are efforts to completely “rule-out” active TB and concerns for potential liver problems with TPT.
Notably, a study focused on more complex (and more sensitive) TB diagnosis resulted in increased mortality in
the arm with greater TB diagnosis. That arm also had delayed and lower TPT prescribing. This study seeks to
use choice architecture to make TPT prescribing the usual or “default” with not-prescribing occurring only when
the clinician has a real concern (e.g. high concern for TB disease). The effectiveness of the choice
architecture-based implementation strategy will be compared to the usual implementation in a cluster-
randomized trial. Clinics will be the unit of randomization with all patients receiving services at a study clinic
receiving uniform TPT implementation. The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients initiating ART
who also receive TPT. The underlying concept of choice architecture is that optimizing decision making can
lead to reduced cognitive load. Thus we propose to compare cognitive load regarding TPT prescribing between
study arms. We will also assess congruence of the prescribing approach with clinic work flow, acceptability to
providers, implementation measures, and patient-level implementation (e.g. receipt of TPT, adherence, patient
reported problems). This study has the potential to lead the way in reshaping the delivery of TPT and other
routine services in clinics in South Africa and similar settings. Should this implementation strategy prove
effective it will contribute to national and global goals to reduce HIV-associated mortality and TB incidence."

Much of our collective knowledge on vascular growth has emerged from efforts to understand angiogenesis,
a process by which endothelial cells depart from pre-existent vessels to form new vascular beds.
Nonetheless, once formed, vascular tubes also expand in width, length, and are able to regenerate.
Regeneration is extremely important to the repair of endothelial damage imposed by stents and other
medical devises, as well as to mediate heal after physical/chemical trauma. However our understanding of
the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate endothelial growth and regeneration within the context
of a fully functional, blood perfused and pulsatile vessel are limited. Our preliminary data show that
expansion of the tunica intima in vivo occurs through intrinsic proliferation of intimal endothelial cells in a
polarized and organized manner. In fact, a subset of endothelial cells flanking a wound are robustly induced
to enter into the cell cycle as quickly as 12 hours following injury in a highly synchronized fashion. The
process is initiated by changes in cell-cell junctions that trigger molecular rewiring and impressive
physiological changes. Important outcomes of these responses include alterations in endothelial cell
polarity, induction of chromatin remodeling, adjustments in metabolism and a quick emergence of a
transcriptional signature that is unique to regenerative endothelium. This newly identified signature is finely
tuned by the timed release of stress signals that appear to act differentially in the subsets of endothelial
cells, revealing an intrinsic heterogeneity that controls the threshold for regeneration in a given vessel. In
fact, genetic tracing analysis using endothelial-specific rainbow mice revealed the presence of cells with
different proliferative potential suggesting the intercalation of progenitors within the wall of the endothelial
monolayer. Taken together, these studies are paradigm shifting for understanding the mechanisms
controlling endothelial regeneration and their deregulations in settings like chronic/acute inflammation,
aging, chronic diseases and physical trauma.
Through this NHLBI Outstanding Investigator Award application our goals are to (1) decode the cellular and
molecular mechanisms controlling the process of endothelial expansion within a formed vessel; (2) clarify
the process involved in endothelial regeneration and repair: (3) understand how hijacking these
mechanisms might either accelerate or impair endothelial regeneration; (4) identify novel targets for
therapeutic interventions aimed at endothelial repair during stenting or other injuries. These series of
broadly defined aims have been conceptualize to fill gaps of our knowledge on fundamental biological
processes in endothelial cell biology but also to exploit this information for application during medical
interventions such as stent coverage. We are energized by the opportunity afforded by this grant
mechanism and for the potential translational impact of these studies."

Work related injuries and illnesses are both common and costly, with approximately 2.6 million
work-related injuries and illnesses costing approximately $171billion per year. State, local, tribal
and territorial (SLTT)-based occupational safety and health (OSH) surveillance systems are
essential for identifying and preventing work-related injuries and illnesses. The Council of State
and Territorial Epidemiologists' (CSTE) proposed activities will enhance non-federal
jurisdictions' capacity to collect surveillance data across the 10 National Occupational Research
Agenda (NORA) sectors and all seven NORA cross-sectors for workers of all ages. Outcomes
will include a greater visibility of OSH issues, an increase in the workforce that is able to perform
the essential public health services related occupational health epidemiology, and for more
state, local, tribes and territories to have an effective occupational safety and health surveillance
program, and ultimately, a reduction in workplace exposures, injuries and illness for all NORA
sectors/cross-sectors. As the surveillance initiatives included in this proposal address all NORA
sectors, the outcomes outlined in the proposal support all seven of NORA's strategic goals as
well the NIOSH's intermediate goal for its surveillance program (SS 1.1). There are 24 outputs
in this proposal, however many of the outputs include multiple components so the total number
of outputs are appreciably greater. Examples of outputs include: Coordination between CSTE,
state, local, tribes, territories NIOSH and other partners; Reports, how-to guides and other tools
related to Occupational Health Indicators, which enable different jurisdictions to uniformly collect
and report on occupational health, illness and risk data; communication, training and outreach
strategies, such as webinars, newsletters and consultations to disseminate information and best
practices; working groups meetings and other forums for sharing scientific information; and the
development of OSH surveillance tools and technical documents. This proposal supports the
NIOSH Research to Practice (r2p) approach by fostering collaboration among non-federal
programs and NIOSH and providing a forum by which additional research needs are identified,
and by translating surveillance data through various communication and outreach strategies.
Additionally, the activities in this proposal will help educate the non-federal OSH surveillance
workforce, which will facilitate more partnerships in each jurisdiction to share research findings,
data, and educational messages for improvement of health and safety in workplaces across the
U.S."

Approximately one-fourth of the world's population is latently infected (LTBI) with Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(Mtb) and those infected have a 10% lifetime risk of developing clinical pulmonary TB (PTB) disease over their
lifetime. Global efforts to combat TB are hampered by the emergence of extensively drug-resistant and multidrug-
resistant strains and the variable efficacy of the currently available vaccine, M. bovis Bacille Calmette Guerin.
Unfortunately, the immune mechanisms that govern progression from LTBI to PTB are poorly defined, preventing
rational design of treatments or vaccines that stimulate immune control of TB. Thus, there is an urgent need to
better understand the immune parameters that contribute to Mtb control. The tubercle granuloma is a hallmark
of TB and is important for the immune control of Mtb infection. However, not all granulomas effectively control
TB, as they are seen both during LTBI and during TB reactivation (TB-R) and PTB. During the previous R01
funding period, we used human TB samples and non-human primate (NHP) and mouse models of TB to
demonstrate an unequivocal protective role for inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT)
containing clearly defined B-cell follicles during both primary and vaccine-induced responses to Mtb infection.
Additionally, we determined that a dominant feature of granulomas during PTB is the accumulation of neutrophils
that produce proinflammatory molecules such as S100A8/A9 proteins and limit iBALT formation. Our long-term
goal is to develop clinical strategies to restrain Mtb growth and prevent progression from LTBI to TB disease.
Based on work from this funded R01, the objective of this R01 renewal is to identify the roles of granuloma-
associated B cells and neutrophils in TB infection and disease progression and to determine if iBALT is an
effective target for preventing TB progression. Towards this overall goal, we propose to use both small animal
and large animal models to address the following specific aims: In Specific Aim 1 we will investigate the role of
iBALT-residing B cells in protecting against TB; In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the role of neutrophilic
proteins such as S100A8/A9 in limiting iBALT during PTB, and to determine if targeting S100A8/A9 pathways
will reduce TB disease and improve Mtb control; Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will determine if iBALT structures
can be targeted to prevent TB progression in Mtb-infected hosts. The knowledge to be gained from these studies
is significant, as it will directly advance the development of new therapeutics and vaccine strategies for limiting
TB-R and progression to TB."

 Non-targeted analysis (NTA) provides a comprehensive approach to analyze environmental and biological
samples for nearly all chemicals present. Despite the recent advancements in NTA, the number of confirmed
chemicals with analytical standards remains fairly small compared to the number of detected features. There
is, thus, a need to further develop computational tools to derive more chemical structures and leverage the full
potential of HRMS. Enhancing our ability to derive more chemical structures will enable the discovery of new
industrial chemicals that humans are exposed to, especially in critical windows of development, such as
pregnancy. It will also enable the discovery of endogenously produced metabolites that may be related to
biological outcomes of importance, such as preterm birth. The objective of my proposal is to develop novel
computational methods to significantly advance our ability to analyze and interpret non-targeted analysis data
from high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and apply them to study prenatal exposures to industrial
chemicals and endogenous metabolites in a large cohort of pregnant women from Northern California. My
proposal builds on my expertise in analytical and environmental chemistry and my current postdoctoral
experience in computational chemistry and applications in human exposure. I seek additional training to
develop and apply innovative computational methods to better characterize the human exposome and in
particular the exposome of preterm birth. The contribution of my proposal will be two-fold: (1) developing novel
computational structure-prediction algorithms for HRMS datasets based on MS data and physicochemical
properties (equilibrium partition ratios between organic solvents and water, e.g., octanol/water,
chlorobenzene/water, diethyl ether/water etc.) (Aim 1) and apply them to derive potential structures for
chemical features detected in a HRMS dataset from 340 maternal and 340 matched cord blood samples to
complement the limited number of chemicals identified through MS/MS and analytical standards (Aim 2); and
(2) study the interplay between the exposome and the metabolome in preterm birth using molecular interaction
networks to visualize and compare how molecular interactions between industrial chemicals and endogenous
metabolites differ between preterm and full-term birth (Aim 3). The K99 training will expand my prior research
experience through coursework, research apprenticeship, and mentored reading, with specific training in: (1)
advanced analytical skills including -omics data analysis, machine learning, and biostatistics; (2) epidemiology,
risk assessment, human exposure to chemical stressors; and (3) human pregnancy and development. The
skills acquired during this award are critical to my long-term goal to advance computational methods to better
analyze and interpret non-targeted analysis data to support efforts to better characterize the human exposome.
This work will produce new scientific knowledge to greatly advance the understanding of the influence of
environmental exposures in the development of adverse health outcomes and in particular, preterm birth."

In all living organisms, transition metals are essential trace elements. Their unique chemical properties are
exploited in metalloenzymes, metalloproteins, and as signaling ions, to perform key biochemical processes.
Integrated metal uptake, distribution, storage, and sensing protein networks guarantee that essential metals are
delivered to their correct targets, while toxic metals are selectively removed from the cellular environment.
Transmembrane metal transporters and interacting metallochaperones are key hubs that selectively regulate the
fluxes of metals across cellular membranes. The chemical, molecular and structural principles that govern metal
transporter cargo selectivity, promiscuity, translocation, and substrate delivery by metallochaperones and
associated metalloproteins are elusive. We developed a strategy that leverages integrated chemical, biophysical,
and structural approaches to determine how metal selection and transport occurs in transporter families featuring
different topologies, transport mechanisms, and energetics. This MIRA application targets the study of primary
active metal pumps, secondary active solute carriers (SLC), and ion facilitators to address: i) the bioinorganic
and coordination chemistry determinants controlling substrate selectivity, affinity, and kinetic lability for rapid
translocation across membranes; ii) how conserved structural frameworks in transporter families are adapted to
diversify cargo specificity towards essential 1st-row and toxic 2nd/3rd-row transition metals; iii) how energy
transduction and conformational changes are coupled to substrate transport; and iv) the chemical,
thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural principles that control metal delivery and uptake to/from transporters by
metallochaperones. The program will target metal transporters involved in metal homeostasis, disease
progression, and pathogen virulence: 1) copper and zinc P-type ATPase pumps and their metallochaperones,
which control copper levels in humans and Cu/Zn concentrations in bacteria acting as virulence factors; 2)
TMEM205, that we discovered as a new human copper/platinum transporter involved in Cu(I)-homeostasis and
anti-cancer Pt-drug resistance, and TMEM52B as its putative chaperone; 3) Fe(II)-selective prokaryotic and
eukaryotic transporters belonging to the IroT, ZIP and CDF families, responsible for iron acquisition and virulence
in pathogens causing bacterial infections and neglected tropical diseases; and 4) prokaryotic nickel and cobalt
transporters controlling essential acquisition of scarce trace elements for Ni/Co enzyme maturation. We will
combine biophysical, spectroscopic, and structural transporter characterization in detergents with the study of
substrate translocation events in real-time in native-like lipid bilayer systems, using the innovative fluorescence
multi-probe platform that we established in our group. We expect to reveal new paradigms underlying transport
kinetics, thermodynamics and mechanism in metal transporters. By targeting neglected aspects of bioinorganic
chemistry in biomedically relevant systems with potential for translational applications, we expect to contribute
to fundamental understanding of metal transport processes across biological membranes in health and disease."

Mitochondria multitask various functions such as generating vast amounts of cellular energy and regulating cell
survival. Owing to their numerous cellular functions, mitochondria are often targeted by pathogens as a means
to promote infection. Indeed, pathogenic microbes use various means to subvert mitochondrial function in order
to survive and establish residence in their new host environment. In response to this targeted attack,
mitochondria execute various mechanisms to counter the growing infection. This includes the activation of the
mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), a stress signaling pathway that helps mitigate dysfunction to
mitochondria through transcriptional adaptation. The UPRmt stimulates mitochondrial recovery by promoting
mitochondrial proteostasis, reactive oxygen species detoxification, and metabolic adaptation, among others.
Critically, the UPRmt also elicits an innate immune response as an antimicrobial strategy to fight infection and
promote host survival. Consistently, loss of the UPRmt renders animals more susceptible to bacterial infection
while, conversely, priming animals prior to infection increases host survival times. The coupling of innate
immunity/antimicrobial defense with the UPRmt is intuitive when considering how often mitochondria are targeted
during infection. Here, we will continue to explore the fundamental question of how the UPRmt acts as a
host defense mechanism during infection. Our proposal will address three broad questions: What is the role
of diet and nutrient sensing in the regulation of the UPRmt during infection? How does microbial metabolism
impact the UPRmt and host survival during infection? What role does the UPRmt play in the mammalian immune
system to protect the host from infection? In addition to leveraging the powerful genetics of C. elegans to dissect
these intricate questions, we will implement mouse models of infection that, combined, will yield important new
and exciting insights into the UPRmt as a host antibacterial defense mechanism. Considering the significant rise
of infections by antibiotic resistant bacteria, new alternative clinical interventions may be necessary.
Understanding how the UPRmt provides protection during infection, therefore, will not only lead to conceptual
advances in the field of host-pathogen interactions, but may hold therapeutic value as well."

Immunosuppressed individuals are increasingly recognized as a focal point of the COVID-19 epidemic. They are
at increased risk of chronic COVID-19 infection, therapeutic treatment failure, severe disease and COVID-19
mortality. Evidence is also emerging that they may also be drivers of COVID-19 variant/subvariant emergence,
due to their risk of prolonged infection and accelerated viral evolution. However, the immune and viral
mechanisms by which chronic infection, viral evolution, and drug resistance occur in this population are poorly
understood. To improve health outcomes for this high-risk population and to reduce the risk of viral evolution and
drug resistance, there is an urgent need to address gaps in our understanding of which immune deficiencies
increase the risk of chronic COVID-19 infection and accelerated viral evolution. The primary goal of this proposal
is to determine the host and virologic characteristics that promote chronic viral infection and viral evolution. The
proposing investigators will an existing translational research infrastructure with experience recruiting cohorts
of immunosuppressed individuals with COVID-19 and broad expertise in clinical research, viral quantification,
viral culture, sequencing, and immunology. The results will provide critical new data about COVID-19
pathogenesis, variant evolution, therapeutic response, and inform the clinical care of immunosuppressed

 Metazoan organismal lifespan is determined by a combination of chronological lifespan (the length
of time a cell exists in a non-dividing state before dying) and replicative lifespan (the number of times a cell
divides before irreversibly arresting; most accurately studied in budding yeast [Saccharomyces cerevisiae]).
Many chemical, dietary and genetic interventions can extend lifespan. These are usually first discovered in
budding yeast, and subsequently shown to apply in metazoans. However, there is still little understanding of
their underlying molecular mechanisms for lifespan extension. A variety of interventions, including
medications, genetic manipulations, and calorie restriction (CR), have been demonstrated to extend the
lifespan of several species. However, there is a significant knowledge gap as to the identity of the ultimate
molecular changes enacted by these antiaging interventions to extend lifespan. We recently showed that
overexpression of Gcn4, the yeast counterpart of the metazoan ATF4 protein that induces multiple stress
response pathways, extended the yeast replicative lifespan (RLS) (the number of times a cell divides before
irreversibly arresting) in a manner dependent on autophagy. This finding inspired us to ask whether
autophagy is required for other antiaging interventions to extend the yeast RLS. Our preliminary findings
indicate that interventions that extend lifespan in many organisms, including rapamycin, metformin, ribosome
depletion, CR, and increased sirtuin activity, extend the yeast RLS in an autophagy-dependent manner.
Furthermore, we find that induction of autophagy is sufficient to extend the yeast RLS. Given that autophagy
induction is also sufficient to extend lifespan in metazoans, we will use the yeast model to seek ultimate
molecular targets of autophagy that promote antiaging."

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging mosquito-borne Flavivirus that recently caused an outbreak in the Americas. The
establishment of ZIKV transmission cycle in tropical/sub-tropical regions that are endemic to other close-related flaviviruses
such as Dengue virus (DENV) has raised concerns, mainly by their cross-immunological interactions and the implications
of this for development of severe clinical manifestations. Several groups have demonstrated that DENV-immune serum
from humans can enhance ZIKV infection in vitro and in vivo in an immunodeficient mice model. This phenomenon known
as Antibody Dependent-Enhancement (ADE) has been linked to severe dengue clinical manifestations. Little is known about
the effect of a previous immunity to ZIKV on a subsequent DENV infection. It is highly necessary to characterize correlates
of protection in the control of a heterologous secondary DENV or ZIKV infection in the presence of previous DENV or
ZIKV immunity in an immunological competent animal model that resemble the human immune system like the Non-
Human Primates. Our group have preliminary data showing a potential protective role of the cellular immune response in
dengue- immune or ZIKV-immune subjects during a heterologous secondary infection with ZIKV or dengue. The overall
hypothesis behind this work is that the cross-primed cellular immune response may be critical controlling the DENV and
ZIKV infection and provides heterologous protection against each other. To test this hypothesis, we propose a series of
straightforward experiments by depleting the CD4+ or CD8+ or CD20+ cells at different time points before a primary or a
secondary infection with dengue or ZIKV. This type of experiment has not been performed before in NHP. For these
experiments we will use rhesus macaques bred and housed at the Caribbean Primate Research Center that has proven to be
the purer Indian-origin macaque population of all populations in the USA or imported animals, without having a significant
level of inbreeding. For first time in any study in the flavivirus field, we will use a large data on the MHC typing of this
population to characterize specific CD4 and/or CD8 T cells epitopes playing a role in the T cells immune response against
dengue and ZIKV. Understanding correlates of protection between ZIKV and DENV is essential to anticipate the outcome
of the secondary infection, the design of diagnostics methods and more relevant, to support the design of highly effective
ZIKV and DENV vaccines in the scenario of previous DENV or ZIKV immunity, respectively. Undoubtedly, NHP provide
us with a unique immunological tool very close to the human system to provide the answers to the questions we are outlying
on this application."

support and continuity for the Partnership investigators and the communities during multiple major hurricanes,
earthquakes, and the pandemic. The AC leadership has worked closely together for the last 16 years and
possesses a wealth of institutional, Partnership, and NCI knowledge providing long-term stability. The AC will
continue to support all projects, cores, and shared resources and act as the incubator for innovative efforts to
reduce cancer disparities in Hispanic/Latino (H/L) communities. The goals of the AC are to support growth and
innovation, which is accomplished by the following specific aims: 1) Provide infrastructure for the Partnership.
The AC will provide oversight and support related to scientific leadership, fiscal oversight and management,
recruitment and retention of faculty and Partnership staff, productivity oversight, preparation of non-competing
progress reports, and conflict resolution. The AC will accomplish this aim by establishing clear expectations,
setting the overall direction of the Partnership, and developing new leaders to promote its sustainability. 2)
Facilitate communication and integration throughout all levels of the Partnership by ensuring the dissemination
of activities, opportunities, challenges, and accomplishments to all members of the Partnership, Institutional
leadership, and the broader institutional members. 3) Manage and advance the portfolio of Partnership research
projects from initial solicitation through acquiring independent external funding. The AC will stimulate scientific
discussions, set the guidelines and timing of all new project solicitations, and manage the selection and activation
of high-impact projects. The AC will provide support for scientific publications, submission of research grants to
external funding agencies, and identify additional resources for project success. 4) Support the advancement of
Early-Stage Investigator (ESI) careers. The AC will identify and recruit promising ESIs to the Partnership, foster
their development, and oversee their progress collaborating with the Research Education Core (REC) to provide
career development resources, mentoring, and sponsorship tailored to each ESI. The overall goals are to
promote the career advancement of a diverse junior faculty pool and to attract young investigators to focus on
cancer health disparities and minority health."
10933549,"ABSTRACT | FULL RESEARCH PROJECT 1
Puerto Rican (PR) Hispanic/Latino (H/L) men have the highest prostate cancer (PCa) mortality among Hispanic
populations. According to the recent PR Cancer Registry data, PCa is the leading cancer type in terms of
incidence (35% of all cancer cases) and mortality (17% of all cancer deaths) in PR H/L men. They have
significantly higher PCa-specific mortality than non-Hispanic white (NHW) and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) men;
addressing this gap constitutes our central efforts. While socioeconomic status and access to healthcare are
contributors, manifest differences in molecular features between racial groups highlight the role of tumor biology
in racially disparate outcomes in PCa. Our long-term goal is to identify DNA methylation biomarkers driving gene
expression changes that underly PCa therapy resistance and aggressiveness in at-risk populations, particularly
PR H/L men. The central hypothesis is that differences in tumor DNA methylation patterns and population
admixture are associated with drug response and aggressiveness in PCa in PR H/L men. The rationale is that
identifying the molecular basis of PCa disparities will serve to reduce the burden of lethal PCa disparities affecting
PR H/L men. Our goals will be accomplished through two Specific Aims: Aim 1) Investigate associations between
aggressiveness and methylated genes in PCa among the PR H/L population and the impact of methylation on
their expression. (1a) Investigate differentially methylated genes associated with drug resistance and
aggressiveness among PR H/L PCa patients and compare with methylation data from NHB from the Florida PCa
biobank, NHW PCa patients from MCC, and TCGA. (1b) Evaluate differential DNA methylation on gene
expression patterns. We will establish comparisons with previous data obtained from NHW men from MCC and
TCGA. (1c) Evaluate whether population admixture will modify the methylation level of PR-specific methylated
genes. Further, we will investigate whether genes that contain ancestry determinants are associated with the
aggressiveness of PCa and disparity. Aim 2. Assess the contribution of DNA methylation to PCa resistance to
standard therapies using drug-resistant PCa sublines and liquid biopsies from PCa patients progressing after
treatment. (2a) Identify differentially methylated genes associated with drug-resistant phenotypes using cell-
based models of drug resistance including castration resistance, enzalutamide resistance, and docetaxel
resistance. (2b) Evaluate the expression of differentially methylated genes in resistant sublines compared to
sensitive cell lines. (2c) Assess the effect of DNA methylation inhibition on drug sensitivity in resistant
phenotypes. (2d) As an exploratory aim, we will evaluate resistance-associated methylation profiles in blood
samples from PR and MCC patients previously treated with androgen deprivation therapy, androgen receptor-
targeting agents, or taxane-based chemotherapy. The identification and validation of novel DNA methylation
signatures associated with aggressive and drug-resistant PCa in PR men have the potential to improve risk
stratification and treatment selection in this high-risk, understudied population."
10933555,"ABSTRACT | RESEARCH EDUCATION CORE
The Research Education Core (REC) of the Ponce Health Sciences University and Moffitt Cancer Center
Partnership has built an educational program that supports participants across the career continuum preparing
them for basic or clinical oncology-related careers. The long-term goal of the REC is to increase the recruitment,
advancement, and quality of cancer research scientists and oncologists from the Puerto Rican and
Hispanic/Latino (H/L) population while advancing health disparities research focused on this population. Through
ongoing interactions with all components of the Partnership, the REC’s educational framework (2007-2022) has
resulted in: 125 participants obtaining faculty, medical, or industry/federal/academic positions with 30 in
hematology-oncology clinical practice; completion of 137 research rotations by PhD, MD or PsyD students;
guidance of 22 Early-Stage Investigators (ESIs); and the creation of new courses, clerkships, and robust cancer
and health disparities seminar series. Leveraging our prior successes the REC strategy is designed to jointly
engage participants across career levels and institutes to create a lasting peer mentoring network which will be
accomplished under the following aims: Aim 1 engages H/L undergraduate students at both PHSU and MCC,
eight total per year, in a new two-year-plus program with year-round mentoring and research experiences
combined with intensive summer research immersion to promote conceptual change in preconceived ideas of
limited opportunities and ‘fit’ for STEM and cancer research. Aim 2 establishes two-year diversity post-doctoral
scholarships at MCC for H/L fellows to support career success with a focus on cancer health disparities and
minority health; and also establishes career development scholarships for late-stage PHSU PhD students to
support career enhancement activities and successful transition to post-doctoral training. Two rolling scholarship
slots are available at each site. The scholarships are interwoven with training in cultural competency,
professionalism, scientific writing, and health disparities to successfully promote a path toward independence.
Aim 3 addresses the need to increase the number of H/L medical residents and medical students entering an
oncology career track. REC will facilitate the creation of the first urology residency program in PR, enable surgical
oncology training at MCC for two PR surgical residents per year, and immerse eight medical students per year
in a summer cancer research experience alongside PhD students. Aim 4 enhances the career development of
ESIs by providing individualized support for each ESI through collaborative interactions, health disparities
training, grant/scientific writing workshops, career development activities, identifying networking opportunities,
and tracking, and evaluating ongoing mentorship and sponsorship. In sum, REC trainees will gain cancer
research and health disparities experience through exposure to Partnership projects and Cores. The REC
outcomes will support the overall Partnership objectives by building and strengthening trainee career pathways
at critical career transition points, resulting in a more diverse pool of oncologists and research scientists."
10760182,"ABSTRACT
 The WHO Global Oral Health Status Report (2022) estimated that oral diseases affect close to $3.5 billion
people worldwide. Dental caries and cracks are two common dental diseases. Globally, an estimated $2 billion
people suffer from caries of permanent teeth and $514 million children suffer from caries of primary
teeth. Cracked tooth is a common dental hard tissue disease and is the third major cause of tooth loss after
caries and periodontal disease. While there are some adjuncts based on autofluorescence and
transillumination for detecting caries and crack, none of them can provide quantitative and internal tooth
structural information for accurate diagnosis and monitoring treatment progress.
 To address the need of a quantitative device for earlier detection and more accurate diagnosis of caries
and crack, Light Research Inc (LRI) proposes to optimize and commercialize a compact multimodal intraoral
camera which uniquely integrates polarized white light imaging (pWLI), autofluorescence imaging (AFI), optical
coherence tomography (OCT) imaging, and novel NIR transillumination imaging (NIR-TI) modalities. Four
imaging modalities with distinct and complementary contrast mechanisms will improve the sensitivity and
specificity in detecting caries and crack significantly.
 The novel system design facilitates the compact integration of four different imaging modalities and
enables the seamless transition between imaging modalities. The proposed camera is clinically innovative in
that it will screen the tooth in wide field of view (FOV) imaging modes (pWLI, AFI, and/or NIR-TI) to detect and
segment suspicious region, and then guide OCT scan to obtain internal tooth structural information of the
suspicious region for accurate diagnosis. Earlier caries and crack detection will enable the dental practitioner to
initiate early prophylactic treatment, the internal tooth structural information from OCT image and the registered
wide-FOV pWLI and AFI images will facilitate the monitoring of treatment progress.
To achieve the project goal, LRI has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in developing (Dr.
Wilder-Smith) and validating (Dr. Amaechi) optical technologies for oral diseases including caries and crack,
developing commercial dental products (Dr. Liang), and developing advanced image processing (Dr. Song).
The project team members have collaboratively or independently investigated different imaging modalities for
caries and crack detection, as well as for oral cancer detection and diagnosis. In this project, the team will first
optimize and prototype two compact multimodal intraoral cameras and develop deep learning-based image
segmentation algorithms (Aim 1), optimize system settings and evaluate the proposed multimodal intraoral
camera (Aim 2), and then conduct a pilot clinical study to evaluate performance of the multimodal intraoral
camera in detecting caries and cracks in human subjects (Aim 3)."
10762341,"The goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms underlying how negative endogenous signaling
reduces chronic inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which can provide novel therapeutic targets for
diseases related to inflammation and tissue destruction. Current therapies for RA have serious negative effects
on the patients’ immune system, and can cause malignancies, pneumonia, and tuberculosis. Positive regulators
of inflammation in RA (such as NF-κB) have been well characterized, however, the negative endogenous
regulators of RA-induced inflammation and bone destruction, especially in macrophages and dendritic cells in
RA pathological condition remain elusive. The proposed study will characterize the negative endogenous
regulators of differentiation and activity in macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) that attenuate RA-induced
inflammation and tissue destruction. We noted that Gα13 deficiency in macrophages or dendritic cells
aggravated inflammation in mouse RA model. AAV mediated overexpression of local Gna13 constitutively
active form (Gna13CA) not only significantly reduced bone destruction, but also dramatically inhibited
inflammation in RA, indicating that Gna13CA could protect against inflammation in a mouse model of RA. Our
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis showed that Gα13 may negatively regulate macrophage and DC
differentiation and activation and ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis showed the enrichment of NF-κB motif
site binding on the genome-wide promoters of the genes related to inflammation in Gα13 deficient macrophages
with TNFα or LPS stimulations. Our preliminary data showed that Gα13 deficiency promotes Akt activity, STAT3
phosphorylation and NF-κB signaling pathway activation in dendritic cells and macrophages. Based on
our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that Gα13 is a master negative regulator that attenuates inflammation
and bone destruction associated with rheumatoid arthritis through the Gα13/RhoA/AKT/IKK/NF-κB pathway in
macrophages and dendritic cells. Three specific aims are proposed to test our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will
determine the role of Gα13 in inflammation and bone destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by characterizing
the phenotypes and pathomechanism of conditional knockout (CKO) mouse models via loss-of-function
approach in RA. In Aim 2, we will define the roles and therapeutic effects of Gα13CA in inflammation and bone
destruction in RA by characterizing the phenotypes and pathomechanism of conditional transgenic
overexpression (OE) mouse models via gain-of-function approach in RA. We will characterize the molecular
mechanism by which Gα13 regulates inflammation and bone destruction in RA through Gα13/
RhoA/AKT/IKK/NF-κB signaling, STAT3 signaling, and TLRs signaling pathways in macrophages and dendritic
cells in Aim 3. The proposed study will provide important insights into the negative regulation of the cells of the
immune system to effectively target inflammation and bone destruction in RA. Knowledge gained from this study
may bring forth potential superior therapeutic means for treating RA and other inflammatory bone diseases."
10762342,"Project Summary
Periodontal disease (PD) is a prevalent oral inflammatory condition that is epidemiologically associated with
systemic disorders (comorbidities), such as, cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and type-2 diabetes.
An independent association between PD and comorbidities remains even after adjustment for confounders. A
possible factor contributing to this independent association is that PD can cause low-grade systemic
inflammation, which may in turn influence comorbidities. The relationship between PD and systemic comorbidities
is bidirectional in that systemic diseases can also promote susceptibility to PD. However, there is no known
unifying causal mechanism that can explain how PD affects and is affected by comorbidities. To mechanistically
explain the reciprocal association between PD and comorbid conditions, a novel hypothesis is proposed based
on the recent concept that systemic inflammatory stimuli can cause epigenetic rewiring of hematopoietic stem
and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the bone marrow, which enables these cells to give rise to ‘trained’ myeloid cells
that can respond more strongly to future stimuli. This concept represents a form of innate immune memory and
is known as ‘trained innate immunity’ (TII). TII can be protective in infections but potentially detrimental, hence
maladaptive, in inflammatory disorders. Thus, given that chronic inflammatory diseases are – in large part –
driven by the action of inflammatory myeloid cells, inflammation-driven transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations
in their bone marrow progenitors are likely to influence the initiation or the progression of different chronic
inflammatory disorders that emerge as comorbidities. This project involves investigation of the comorbidity of PD
with another inflammatory bone loss disorder, rheumatoid arthritis. The overarching hypothesis is that
maladaptive TII constitutes a mechanistic basis for the comorbid connection of PD and arthritis, which are studied
using validated preclinical models, ligature-induced PD (LIP) and collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA),
respectively. The objective of Aim 1 is to show that inflammation-adapted HSPCs in the bone marrow mediates
the comorbid association of PD and inflammatory arthritis. That the proposed maladaptive effect is mediated by
inflammation-adapted (‘trained’) HSPCs will be tested by bone marrow transplantation experiments. Aim 2 was
designed to investigate whether experimental PD induces transmissible epigenetic modifications in bone marrow
progenitors towards a maladaptive inflammatory phenotype that underlies the development of inflammatory
comorbidities. Further studies are proposed to show that interleukin-1β acts on HSPCs to mediate LIP-induced
trained myelopoiesis and increased disease activity (Aim 3). If successful, this project will provide a unifying
network for and mechanistic insights into the interconnection of inflammatory comorbidities and maladaptive TII
in the bone marrow. Such conceptual framework could also provide a platform for novel therapeutic interventions
targeting inflammatory comorbidities via pharmacological modulation of TII."

This proposal entails strengthening the efforts between Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center
(DLDCCC) at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and Texas Southern University (TSU), an institution
serving underserved health disparity populations and a historically black college and university (HBCU),
to establish the Baylor-Texas Southern P20 consortium or BCM-TSU P20 Collaborative Union for Cancer
Research, Education and Disparities (CURED). BCM-TSU P20 CURED will develop the infrastructure for a
cancer research program with a specific focus on cancer health disparities (including biology, outcomes,
and access to treatment) and community engagement with a joint Cancer Research Education Program.
This collaboration builds upon complementary expertise in cancer health disparities at DLDCCC/BCM
and TSU, cancer drug discovery and pharmacokinetics at TSU, and robust patient and community-
focused outreach and engagement focused on predominantly minority populations of both institutions
with complementary expertise and allowance of shared resources and ongoing joint endeavors with
both institutions.
The proposal for BCM-TSU P20 CURED includes the Center of Excellence for Housing and Community
Development Policy Research (CEHCDPR), a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Center
of Excellence, at TSU as a member of the research team. Faculty with CEHCDPR will partner with faculty
from the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology at BCM to study the associations between the
social determinants of health (SDOH) and bladder cancer to understand the racial disparities in disease
progression, in which African Americans experience more severe outcomes than Whites. CEHCDPR will
develop a SDOH interviewer-administered survey that will include questions about socioeconomic
characteristic, smoking history, and health care access, and residential and workplace history. BCM will
administer the survey to consenting bladder cancer patients. Once BCM has completed the survey,
CEHCDPR will use Geographic Information Systems software to geolocate each patient’s historical
residential location. CEHCDPR will compile data layers from existing sources, including US Census and
US EPA, on the socioeconomic and environmental conditions of the patient’s residential neighborhoods.
Concurrently, BCM will run DNA testing of tissue samples from the patients who completed the survey.
The CEHCDPR and BCM datasets will be combined and CEHCDPR will analyze the data to evaluate the
association between the SDOH and the cancer DNA data."
10761740,"ABSTRACT:
We, and others, have determined that cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferation is dependent on cardiac endothelial
cells (CECs). Proliferating CECs are spatiotemporally coupled to proliferating CMs in the neonatal mouse
heart; loss of CECs leads to decreased CM proliferation; and higher levels of the master angiogenic factor
Vegfa promote cardiac growth in zebrafish, neonatal mice, and humans. Based on these studies, our
overall hypothesis is that activated, proliferating CECs instruct CM proliferation. Here, we propose studies
to determine how CECs promote CM proliferation. We will use scRNA-seq and spatial modeling to identify
the specific subset of CECs physically associated with proliferating CMs; we will determine how Ezh2-
mediated chromatin remodeling coordinates CEC activation with CM proliferation; and we will define the
potency of CEC-induced growth factors to stimulate CM proliferation. This work will result in new cellular,
epigenetic, and paracrine mechanisms for CEC-induced cardiac growth and has high potential to inform
methods for therapeutic heart regeneration."
10778580,"With extensive application of treatment strategies, the acute mortality of patients having myocardial infarct (MI)
has significantly reduced but these patients turn to ischemic cardiomyopathy (IC). Importantly, the incidence of
IC is much higher in diabetic patients, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Despite the major advances
in cardiac interventions, diabetic IC (DIC) morbidity and mortality continue to rise. It is increasingly recognized
that integrative approaches, rather than purely focusing on cardiomyocytes, must be undertaken for DIC
prevention/treatment. Supplementation of adiponectin (APN), a protein identified as an adipokine, protects the
acute ischemic heart in animal model. However, several clinical studies demonstrate that elevated APN levels
are strongly associated with poor prognosis of chronic HF. We and others previously report that APN function is
markedly attenuated in diabetic animals and patients. Our most recent study demonstrates that diabetes injures
heart not only on cardiomyocytes, the impaired coronary endothelial cells (EC) in diabetes leading to
microcirculation dysfunction dramatically enhancing cardiac dysfunction. Our recently published work and
preliminary experiments further demonstrate that 1) in human diabetic coronary EC, APN receptor 1 knockout
(AdipoR1, prototypic APN receptor in EC) mRNA expression is unchanged, but AdipoR1 protein expression is
significantly reduced; 2) coronary vascular dysfunction (CVDy) is markedly exaggerated in diabetic animals as
well as in AdipoR1KO mice; in type 2 diabetic mice, AdipoR1 expression is significantly reduced in the coronary
EC. 3) proteomics reveal that AdipoR1 phosphorylation is the most significant post-translational modification in
diabetic coronary EC; 4) GRK5 (not GRK2), the prototypical GRK family member in EC, is markedly upregulated
in diabetic coronary EC; 5) GRK5OE in coronary EC has no effect upon AdipoR1 mRNA expression. However,
GRK5OE largely reproduces the pathologic phenotypes in human coronary EC concerning APN/AdipoR1
signaling; 6) conversely, GRK5KO restores APN angiogenic effect in diabetic coronary EC. Based upon these
exciting preliminary results, we will test a novel hypothesis that diabetic GRK5 upregulation and resultant
AdipoR1 phosphorylation plays causative roles in diabetic CVDy and contributes to the deleterious
consequences of DIC. GRK5-AdipoR1 system may be a novel therapeutic target against diabetic CVDy,
ultimately ameliorating the DIC. This hypothesis will be rigorously tested by addressing the following 3 scientific
questions: 1) what is the molecular mechanism that causes AdipoR1 desensitization and blocks AdipoR1
function in diabetes? (Aim 1); 2) How is APN’s coronary vascular protective action impaired when AdipoR1 is
phosphorylated? (Aim 2), and 3) which intervention is most effective in restoring coronary vascular function in
the diabetic heart against DIC? (Aim 3). Successful completion of proposed studies will greatly advance our
knowledge in understanding the basis of diabetic cardiac injury through integrating regulation of coronary
microcirculatory function, and identify novel therapeutic targets against DIC."
10767893,"SUMMARY: Synthesis Core
The Superfund Research Program at The University of Iowa (ISRP) supports investigations of the
consequences of sources and exposures to all airborne polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), an important class
of Superfund chemicals. ISRP biomedical and environmental research projects require a variety of study
compounds ranging from technical and synthetic PCB mixtures to pure PCB congeners and their metabolites
for studies of the volatilization, transport, exposure, toxicity, and remediation of these PCB congeners. A major
obstacle for these studies is the large number of 209 PCB congeners plus the large number of 837 possible
mono-hydroxylated (OH-PCBs), sulfated (PCB sulfates), glucuronidated (PCB glucuronides) and other PCB
metabolites. Many of these PCB derivatives are not available from commercial sources or have never been
synthesized before. Obtaining PCB mixtures or individual PCB congeners from commercial sources can also
be expensive, especially if large quantities are needed for animal studies. Moreover, information about their
synthesis is typically not available from commercial sources. To facilitate the innovative studies proposed by
individual ISRP research projects, there is a critical need to make sufficient quantities of PCBs and their
metabolites available for studies investigating the volatilization, transport, exposure, toxicity, and remediation of
PCBs. To address this critical need, the major objective of the Synthesis Core is to provide a large variety of
well-authenticated and highly-pure PCB derivatives in a timely and cost-efficient manner to ISRP and, as time
and resources allow, other researchers. To attain this objective, the Synthesis Core will synthesize and
maintain a broad range of PCB derivatives and employ rigorous guidelines for the authentication of these key
chemicals. At the same time, the Synthesis Core will continue to develop novel synthetic strategies for the
synthesis of PCB congeners and PCB metabolites as needed by ISRP researchers. The Specific Aims of the
ISRP Synthesis Core are to: 1) maintain and prepare PCB mixtures and pure PCB congeners; 2) prepare
hydroxylated PCB derivatives; 3) synthesize PCB sulfate metabolites; and 4) prepare miscellaneous
compounds, such as: PCB hydroquinones, PCB catechols, PCB quinones, and PCB glutathione and N-
acetylcysteine conjugates. The timely availability of PCB mixtures, individual OH-PCBs, PCB sulfates and
other PCB metabolites will greatly enhance and, if the respective PCB metabolites are unavailable from
commercial sources, enable the innovative studies proposed by ISRP Research Projects. Moreover, the use of
well-authenticated test compounds across several ISRP research projects will greatly enhance the rigor and
reproducibility of ISRP research."
10767896,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Project 1 – Neurotoxicity
Studies by the Iowa Superfund Research Program demonstrate that inhalation of indoor air, especially in U.S.
schools contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), represents a current public health concern for U.S.
adolescents. Although the adolescent brain is vulnerable to the toxicity of PCBs and their metabolites, information
regarding the neurotoxicity of human metabolites of airborne PCBs—which differ significantly from those formed in
rodents—is currently not available. There is, therefore, a critical need to: 1) establish mechanisms by which
human metabolites of PCBs affect neurochemistry (i.e., toxic neurotransmitter metabolites) and subsequent
behavioral outcomes; and 2) determine how metabolism of airborne PCBs and their metabolites in the brain
represents a key event in PCB-mediated neurotoxicity in adolescents exposed to PCBs. The objective of this
project is to inform future risk assessment by defining the link between neurotoxic PCB metabolites present in
the brain and neurotoxic outcomes following exposure during adolescence. Our central hypothesis is that, in
addition to the parent airborne PCBs, metabolites formed in humans are present in the brain and serve as risk
factors for altered neurodevelopment during adolescence. We propose that PCBs, and especially their
metabolites, adversely affect neurotransmitter homeostasis. This hypothesis is based on preliminary studies
showing that metabolites of airborne PCBs: a) are present in the rodent brain; b) cause oxidative stress in vitro
and in vivo; c) alter neurotransmitter homeostasis in dopaminergic neurons in culture, producing ROS and toxic
catecholaldehydes; and d) undergo further metabolism to potentially toxic metabolites in the brain. Guided by
these preliminary data, the novel hypothesis will be tested by 1) identifying cellular sites and targets of airborne
PCB metabolites vs. parent compounds responsible for neurotoxicity in vitro; 2) characterizing the region-
specific biotransformation of PCBs and PCB metabolites with in vitro models and in the adolescent rat brain in
vivo; and 3) determining the effects of human metabolites of airborne PCBs on biochemical markers of PCB
neurotoxicity and behavioral outcomes in rats exposed throughout adolescence in vivo. The proposed research
is innovative because it determines how the disruption of dopamine balance by PCB metabolites disturbs
dopamine levels and/or produces toxic dopamine metabolites detrimental to the brain in adolescence, a period
of vulnerability; and studies localized metabolism in the brain, thus challenging the scientific paradigm that
PCBs are either resistant to metabolism or metabolized only in the liver. Outcomes of the proposed studies will
elucidate the contributions of airborne PCBs and their metabolites to, and their mechanisms of action in,
neurotoxic responses. Thus, the successful completion of this research will impact public health by providing
fundamental, mechanistic insights urgently needed to advance the human risk assessment of exposure to PCBs,
with the ultimate goal of preventing or mitigating adverse outcomes following exposure to this class of Superfund
chemicals."
10767900,"SUMMARY: Project 2 – Metabolic Syndrome
PCBs accumulate in fat and are associated with the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS), yet the
specific role of PCB-induced disruption of adipose endocrine signaling in the development of MetS is unknown.
Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between exposure to PCBs and MetS, a cluster of
conditions including obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia, which increase the risk of heart
disease, stroke, and type II diabetes. The Iowa Superfund Research Program (ISRP) has shown children are
exposed to high levels of airborne PCBs in schools, putting them at potential risk for the development of MetS.
In addition, the ISRP demonstrated that airborne PCB exposure results in the accumulation of PCBs in adipose
tissue. We have shown that dioxin-like PCBs can disrupt adipogenesis, leading to aberrant adipocyte function.
How volatile PCBs affect adipose tissue to contribute to the development of MetS is unknown. We hypothesize
that airborne PCBs and their metabolites contribute to the development of MetS via a mechanism that involves
disruption of adipogenesis and adipocyte endocrine function. We have developed unique tools, including
multiple unique immortal human preadipocyte cell lines and a 3D organoid model system, that enable the study
of PCB-induced alterations in the maturation and function of human adipose tissue in culture. Human
preadipocytes cultured in the 3D organoid model system can mature, store lipids, and secrete adipokines more
efficiently than those in 2D cultures. This system challenges the status quo of 2D culture with a culture model
that is more relevant to human exposure. In Aim 1, we will utilize the 3D system to elucidate the functional
consequences of exposure to PCBs (individual congeners and relevant mixtures) on adipogenesis and
adipocyte function. In Aim 2, we will develop a human adipose-liver biomimetic on-chip that allows for human-
liver specific metabolism of PCBs for facile testing of the effects of PCB and PCB-metabolites on adipose
function. In Aim 3, we will assess how PCB11 and PCB52, two PCBs commonly found in air, affect adipose
function, adiposity, and metabolism in vivo using a rat model, comparing our results to those found with our 3D
system. The studies will be guided by other ISRP projects to determine which PCBs are most prevalent in air
and which PCBs and PCB-metabolites are present in adipose tissue. Further, our work will rely on ISRP cores
for synthesis and analytical assessment of PCBs in study samples. Our project is relevant to the SRP
mandates because it will result in the development of an innovative technology to assess how PCBs act as
endocrine disruptors through their effects on adipose tissue, which, in turn, will be important for assessment of
exposure risk to the development of MetS. Our findings will be of significant interest to regulatory agencies and
communities concerned about how PCB exposure affects MetS in children, adolescents, and young adults."
10767904,"SUMMARY: Project 3 – The AESOP Study
The Iowa Superfund Research Program (ISRP) AESOP Study (Airborne Exposures to Semi-volatile Organic
Pollutants) is a community-based participatory research study that assesses inhalation and dietary exposures
to PCBs, PCB metabolites, and potential biomarkers among cohorts of adolescent children and their mothers
in three Midwest U.S. communities. We previously reported that although intentional production of PCBs as
legacy Superfund chemicals ended in the 1970s, production continues as building material byproducts. The
AESOP Study identifies the determinants of PCB exposures, including dietary intake and airborne exposure
levels indoors and outdoors. In the proposed new funding cycle, the AESOP Study will have an unparalleled
opportunity to characterize the role of personal inhalation exposures to PCBs at home and in schools for their
contribution to the exposure burden that could result in elevated risks for hormone disruption, metabolic
syndrome, and neurobehavioral outcomes. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Collect and analyze demographic,
residential, occupational, activity, dietary, and health data from AESOP Study participants. Aim 2: Characterize
personal exposures to PCB congeners among children and their mothers and apportion exposures to
inhalation and diet at the congener level. The study will analyze blood and urine for 209 PCBs and 74
metabolites as well as for biomarkers of thyroid hormone dysfunction, inflammation, and metabolic syndrome.
Aim 3: Assess adolescent children’s time-integrated personal exposure to airborne PCBs. Aim 4: Model PCB
congener exposures and body burdens; compare modeled and measured data. The study enjoys strong
community support garnered through our Community Advisory Boards working with AESOP Study staff and
the ISRP Community Engagement Core; this support will help facilitate these aims. The AESOP Study
employs bilingual community-based field staff and has enrolled and followed 381 subjects in racially and
ethnically diverse communities, providing new insights into airborne exposures and resulting body burdens.
The AESOP Study provides human samples and data to other projects within the ISRP, providing enhanced
relevance for those projects. De-identified data are widely shared with study participants, the scientific
community, and stakeholders at EPA and ATSDR. The AESOP Study has already changed the prevailing
views on how most Americans are exposed to PCBs. We have demonstrated that children have substantial
exposure to PCB congeners from inhalation at school; their blood shows enrichment with inhaled lower-
chlorinated congeners. This has important implications for children’s environmental health that the AESOP
Study will further elucidate during the next five years."
10767907,"SUMMARY: Project 4 – Sources of Airborne PCBs
Project 4 addresses SRP mandates for improved methods for detecting and assessing the hazards of
Superfund chemicals. We will identify and characterize sources of airborne polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
within schools and homes, and near superfund sites with PCB-contaminated sediments. Sources of airborne
PCBs may include building materials contaminated with legacy Aroclor PCBs, as well as consumer products
that are inadvertently contaminated with PCBs through the manufacturing process. Our central hypothesis is
that emissions of airborne PCBs are a function of the properties of the PCB congeners, environmental
variables, and exposed surfaces in which the PCBs reside. We will examine all PCB congeners, and both
Aroclor and non-Aroclor sources of airborne PCBs. We will evaluate emissions from materials and products
found in schools and neighborhoods in our partner communities using methods that are accurate, precise, and
reproducible. Data produced by Project 4 will enable cost-effective decisions for their removal.
We will address Project 4’s central hypothesis by pursuing the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: We will develop
novel passive sampling materials. We will design and manufacture tailored electrospun nanofiber mat (ENM)
as an efficient and adaptable material for passive air sampling. We will design, calibrate, and deploy samplers
equipped with this novel material to detect and measure PCB congeners in the environment. Aim 2: We will
identify specific sources of airborne PCBs in schools and homes. ISRP research has already shown that
building materials contaminated with Aroclors, and consumer products contaminated with non-Aroclor
congeners, can contribute to high levels of PCBs in indoor air. We will measure airborne PCBs in schools and
homes of Columbus Junction and West Liberty, Iowa; generate an inventory of potential sources in the school
rooms; and measure emissions from those materials. We will also develop new laboratory methods to measure
emissions and will apply computational fluid dynamics modeling of school rooms to determine the role of each
material or consumer product as a source of airborne PCBs. Aim 3: We will characterize emissions from
contaminated waters nation-wide. We hypothesize that contaminated waters are a major outdoor source of
airborne PCB exposure nation-wide. We will use existing public data to predict emissions, dispersion, and
annual median air concentrations in communities surrounding these waters. We will test our prediction through
local measurements of airborne PCBs and communicate our findings to local communities and environmental
protection officials, including the EPA. Our studies require close collaboration with the ISRP Analytical Core,
Community Engagement Core, and Data Management and Analysis Core. Through these collaborations,
Project 4 will provide strategies to prioritize technically and economically practical remediation options that
focus on reduction of exposure to PCBs."
10767912,"SUMMARY: Project 5 – Remediation in Sediments
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are commonly encountered organic chemical pollutants of concern at
Superfund sites, which are often found in river and lake sediments near areas of industrial and commercial
activity. The Iowa Superfund Research Program (ISRP) has shown that airborne PCB emissions from open
water associated with contaminated sediment sources could pose significant inhalation risk to nearby
populations. Project 5 research is based on the critical need to develop, evaluate, and demonstrate innovative
approaches to disrupt the flux of PCBs from sediments to the atmosphere at Superfund sites. Project 5’s
central hypothesis is that black carbon materials containing PCB-degrading biofilms will enhance aerobic
biodegradation of LC-PCBs in contaminated sediments, thereby decreasing their emission into the
atmosphere. Our hypothesis is based on preliminary studies showing that bioaugmentation of aerobic PCB-
degrading bacteria into soils catalyzes improved biodegradation of certain LC-PCB congeners. We also show
that aerobic PCB-degrading bacteria form biofilms on black carbon materials, indicating their potential as
delivery vehicles for introducing PCB-degrading bacteria into sediments. Guided by these preliminary data, we
will test our central hypothesis by: 1) optimizing tailored black carbon materials with sorptive and reactive
properties toward LC-PCBs and the ability to host aerobic PCB-degrading biofilms; 2) evaluating the
performance of black carbon materials containing aerobic PCB-degrading biofilms to lower LC-PCB
concentrations in water and air under relevant environmental conditions; and 3) scaling up production of
biofilm-coated black carbon materials to demonstrate the feasibility of decreasing airborne PCB flux from
contaminated sediments at the mesocosm-scale. Our work will rely on the support of ISRP cores for synthesis
and analytical assessment of PCBs in study samples. The proposed research is innovative because the
relationship between the removal of LC-PCB congeners from sediments and PCB emissions has not been
studied. There are currently no developed or tested biotechnologies to decrease or prevent airborne PCB
emissions from sediments. Our project is relevant to the SRP mandates because we will develop advanced
methods to decrease the amount and toxicity of PCBs in the environment. Outcomes of this project will benefit
human health by reducing human exposure to airborne PCBs and realize economic benefits by demonstrating
breakthrough alternative PCB remediation approaches that minimize expensive and disruptive measures such
as dredging."

As the hub of our Superfund Research Center (SRC), the Administrative Core will advance our mission—to
understand and mitigate the effects of exposures to metals and metal mixtures found at Superfund sites on
late-life cognitive health—by providing executive oversight of all SRC activities, from scientific to fiscal to
logistical to research translation. Based in the Department of Environmental Health at the Harvard T.H. Chan
School of Public Health, the Administrative Core will comprise a Director (Dr. Quan Lu), Deputy Director (Dr.
Julie Zimmerman of Yale University), Research Translation Coordinator (Dr. Katherine von Stackelberg), and
Center Administrator and will be guided by an Executive Committee (comprising Project and Core Leaders)
and an External Advisory Committee. The Core will provide leadership and coordination to ensure that all
Research Project and Core activities align with the Superfund Research Program mandates and Superfund
mission “to solve target problem(s) related to health effects, risk, detection, and/or remediation of hazardous
substances.” The Administrative Core has four Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will organize and coordinate intra-
Center meetings and conferences, including regular seminars, monthly meetings with an Executive Committee,
and yearly meetings with the External Advisory Committee (8 members, including subject matter experts and
stakeholders). In Aim 2, we will organize seminars and meetings to serve as central integration for all
members of the SRC community—professionals who bring diverse expertise in environmental epidemiology,
genetics, molecular toxicology, environmental science and engineering, and computational and data science—
to foster interactions that will strengthen existing collaborations, generate new ideas for future cross-
disciplinary collaborations, and provide interdisciplinary research and translation opportunities for trainees. In
Aim 3, we will provide central administration, fiscal management, and quality management to ensure research
integrity, as well as compliance with NIH requirements for data and resource sharing and human and animal
institutional review board requirements. In Aim 4 we will facilitate research translation through 1) effective
communication within the SRC and with stakeholders, leveraging collaborations with regional SRCs (e.g., the
Northeast regional Superfund trainee conference and the Complex Mixtures working group); 2) partnerships
with government agencies, including a visiting scientist program with EPA; 3) technology transfer in
conjunction with the Harvard Office of Technology Development and Yale Entrepreneurial Institute, and 4)
information dissemination to broad audiences through channels including social media, newsletters, podcasts
and videos. By providing an infrastructure that facilitates communication and integration across all Center
components, the Administrative Core ensures effective integration of the SRC to better understand how early
life exposures to metals influence later life cognition, potential remediation strategies in reducing risks, and the
overall impact on public health."
10767965,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a progressively debilitating and eventually lethal disease,
whereby only the symptoms are treated by current therapeutics. A defining characteristic of PAH is the
excessive cellular proliferation and remodeling of pulmonary arteries (PA) that results in increased
vascular resistance and stiffness, and eventually failure of the right ventricle and death. PAH has a
survival time of less than five-years post diagnosis, and current treatment strategies are self-limiting in
that they do not sufficiently prolong survival time or reverse the pathologic vascular remodeling. In the
previous funding period we established an important role for Galectin-3 (Gal-3) in mediating aberrant
pulmonary vascular remodeling, and demonstrated that Gal-3 knockout rats are protected from PAH and
further showed the ability of pharmacological inhibitors of Gal-3 to prevent and reverse established PAH.
Gal-3 expression was also found in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC), where it promoted
proliferation, migration and resistance to apoptosis.
In preliminary data for this competitive renewal, we find that HIF2α robustly upregulates Gal-3 expression.
Along these lines, we have uncovered a novel HIF2α binding site on the LGALS3 promoter, and using a
capsid modified AAV2 that specifically targets lung endothelial cells (EC), we also show that increased
expression of HIF2α in PAEC in vivo increases Gal-3 and promotes pulmonary hypertension in mice. In
co-culture experiments we show that upregulation of HIF2α in the endothelium can promote increased
Gal-3 expression in the underlying PASMC and enhance proliferation. We also identified DNA
methylation as a major regulator of Gal-3 expression as the DNA methyltransferase, DNMT3A was
downregulated in PAH. Further, silencing DNMT3A increased Gal-3 expression, and a dCas9-DNMT3A
fusion directed to the Gal-3 promoter, decreased Gal-3 expression. In vitro, the combination of hypoxia
and loss of DNA methylation synergize to drive high level Gal-3 expression, and NEAT1 is a recently
described hypoxia regulated lncRNA that regulates smooth muscle cell phenotype and proliferation.
Towards this end, we found that NEAT1 expression is increased in human PAH lung as well as in PA
from MCT rats and is regulated by Gal-3 in PASMC. Our long term objectives are to 1. Determine the cell
specific role of Gal-3 in mediating vascular remodeling and PAH, 2. Investigate the role of DNA
methylation and DNMT3A in regulating Gal-3 expression and synergy with HIF2, and 3. Determine
whether Gal-3 regulation of NEAT1 in PASMC contributes to PAH."

10769305,"PROJECT 1 – PROJECT SUMMARY
Prostate cancer cells (PCa) are highly adaptable in response to the tumor microenvironment. In response to
chronic exposure to a low testosterone environment, Androgen Ablation Therapy (AAT)-resistant PCa cells
adaptively autoregulate androgen receptor (AR) levels through overexpression and gene amplification to
sufficient levels to resume AR signaling. Under increasing pressure of androgen deprivation these AAT resistant
cells become even more resistant to additional hormone therapy through overexpression of AR and other
oncologic drivers such as MYC. Paradoxically, laboratory and clinical studies have demonstrated that AAT-
resistant cells with high AR are often growth inhibited following exposure to supraphysiologic levels of androgen
(SPA). Additionally, AAT-resistant cells exposed to SPA adaptively decrease expression of AR leading to
renewed sensitivity to androgen ablative therapies like enzalutamide (Enza). Based on these results, we
performed clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of high dose T in men with asymptomatic metastatic
AAT-resistant PCa. We termed this therapy “Bipolar Androgen Therapy” (BAT) to reflect rapid cycling between
the polar extremes of supraphysiologic to near castrate levels of serum T over a treatment cycle. In summary,
in these trials we demonstrated that high dose T could be given safely to asymptomatic men with AAT-resistant
PCa. Across the studies, we observed PSA50 and objective response in ~30% of men. Time to
clinical/radiographic progression to BAT in this study and others is ~ 6 months. In the TRANSFORMER study,
195 men with AAT-resistant PCa progressing on Abi were randomized to receive BAT or Enza with subsequent
crossover to the opposite arm. Remarkably, the median time to PSA progression and PSA50 response for
patients receiving Enza after Abi was 3.8 months and 25% but was 10.9 months and 78% respectively for
patients who had BAT before Enza. These results confirm that BAT can increase the duration of response to
AAT such as Enza. Preclinical models and analysis of tumor biopsies from patients pre-BAT from patients
progressing on androgen receptor inhibitors demonstrate that AR inhibitor resistance is correlated with high AR
and MYC expression. These analyses further demonstrate that high pre-treatment AR activity predicts response
to BAT. BAT also induces a rapid downregulation of the MYC oncogene that is associated with response.
However, over time an adaptive decrease in AR and increase in MYC-expression is observed which drives
resistance to BAT. In PCa models, co-administration of BET bromodomain inhibitors with BAT produces
profound decrease/loss of MYC expression that is associated with enhanced cell killing, even in cells that have
developed resistance to BAT. Based on these results, our primary hypothesis is that the combination of BAT
with the bromodomain inhibitor ZEN-3694 will enhance cell killing due to rapid increase in AR and decrease in
MYC signaling. Additionally, the combination of BAT + BET inhibitor will downregulate AR levels and inhibit MYC
expression leading to enhanced response to Enza in AAT-resistant patients."
10769306,"PROJECT 2 – PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune-checkpoint blockade has resulted in unprecedented treatment advances in multiple tumor types, despite
yielding modest results in prostate cancer (PCa). While CTLA-4 and PD-L1 are infrequently expressed in PCa,
B7-H3 (another B7 superfamily member) is highly expressed in many PCas, modulates anti-tumor immune
responses, and is associated with worse prognosis. Targeting B7-H3 is now clinically feasible with the
development of Enoblituzumab, an investigational humanized Fc-optimized (for antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity [ADCC]) monoclonal antibody that binds B7-H3 with high affinity, and with MGC018, a
duocarmycincontaining humanized antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that also binds non-competitively to B7-H3
with high affinity. Notably, enoblituzumab and MGC018 bind to different epitopes on B7-H3, permitting rational
combination of these two agents. Here, we propose to test the hypothesis that B7-H3–targeted treatment (using
the ADC with or without the monoclonal antibody) in patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer
will be safe, tolerable and lead to PSA and radiographic responses, by modulating T cell immunity in the tumor
microenvironment (TME) as well as direct tumor killing by duocarmycin ± ADCC-directed activity. We will build
on our prior experience from our recently completed investigator initiated Enoblituzumab monotherapy trial
(n=32, NCT02923180) to test the hypothesis that therapeutic efficacy can be enhanced through a combination
of enoblituzumab’s myeloid-enhancing and T cell-enhancing activity plus direct B7-H3–targeted cytotoxicity with
MGC018’s duocarmycin payload. Our specific aims are: (1) To investigate the safety and clinical efficacy of
B7H3–targeted treatment (MGC018 alone or combined with enoblituzumab) in the mCRPC setting, (2) To assess
the pathologic and adaptive immunologic effects of single (MGC018) or dual (MGC018 plus enoblituzumab)
B7H3 targeting in PCa, and (3) To interrogate functional antigen-specific T cell repertoires induced by single or
dual targeting of B7-H3 in PCa. These studies will provide the first in-human assessment of immunotherapy-
mediated gene expression changes, both peripheral and intratumoral, in relation to targeted treatment against
B7-H3 mediated by cytotoxic (MGC018) +/- ADCC activity (enoblituzumab) to determine if synergistic anti-tumor
activity is observed. These studies will be the first to integrate novel spatial proteomic/transcriptomic, T cell
repertoires, and functional analyses in PCa patients thereby potentially identifying critical immune molecules and
pathways that can be targeted for additional combinatorial immunotherapy PCa trials in the future."
10769307,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent data have shown that PARP inhibitors are an effective therapeutic strategy for DNA repair-deficient
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The response rates to PARP inhibition have been
most pronounced in patients with a homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) alteration, specifically BRCA1
or BRCA2 mutations. Since only 10-20% of mCRPC patients harbor sensitizing HRD mutations, the group of
men that may potentially benefit from this therapy is limited. Novel strategies to unlock the utility of PARP
inhibitors for treatment of patients that lack HRD defects would therefore have tremendous impact in the
treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Based on our strong preliminary data, here we will test the innovative
hypothesis that the combination of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) and poly-ADP ribose polymerase
inhibitors (PARPi) will produce a “triple-threat” to cancer cells by inducing synthetic lethality even in HR-
proficient mCRPC patients via any of three complementary mechanisms: i) DNMTi-mediated downregulation of
homologous recombination coupled with synergistic generation of DNA damage with both drugs, each trapping
their target enzyme on DNA; ii) epigenetic and DNA damage mediated activation of immunogenic interferon
pathways to promote anti-tumor immune responses; and iii) inhibition of AR signaling, which remains vital to
support growth and survival of mCRPC. We will determine the utility and safety of this combination in different
subtypes of prostate cancer using multiple prostate cancer pre-clinical models in vitro and in vivo (Aim 1),
determine the mechanisms by which the combination induces synthetic lethality in mCRPC (Aim 2), and carry
out a pharmacodynamic biomarker-driven phase 1/1b clinical trial of the combination in men with advanced
mCRPC (Aim 3). If successful, these studies will yield a powerful new therapeutic strategy for mCRPC and
expand the utility of PARPi to men without underlying HRD mutations."
10768922,"PROJECT 1 SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neuroblastoma (NB) remains a leading cause of childhood cancer deaths, and the patients who do survive are
left with long-term side effects, many of which can be life threatening. While the paradigm of molecularly targeted
therapies holds great promise, genomic studies have revealed that NBs are characterized by extensive
intratumor genetic heterogeneity, with subclonal oncogenic drivers often selected for during standard
chemoradiotherapy. Our broad hypothesis is that NB therapy resistance is a dynamic and evolving phenomenon
that can be serially monitored and rationally treated with targeted small molecules and immunotherapies. Our
group discovered gain-of-function mutations in the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase as the etiology for familial NB,
and at the same time co-discovered with several other groups identical mutations as the most frequent somatic
single nucleotide variants leading to a potent oncogenic driver in up to 25% of newly diagnosed high-risk cases.
We have shown that activating mutations in the ALK-RAS-MAPK pathway are highly enriched in the relapse NB
genome, providing the impetus for deep and comprehensive characterization of the spatial and temporal
heterogeneity underpinning therapy resistance across the continuum of therapy. More recently, we have
uncovered epigenetic mechanisms of initial chemotherapy resistance with single cell technologies. Finally, our
recent discovery of methods to target non-mutated peptides derived from intracellular oncoproteins with cellular
therapies offers a new class of therapeutics to target key molecular drivers of NB cellular persistence. The work
proposed in this renewal application will address the challenges of intra-tumoral heterogeneity and persistent
NB cells that survive therapy and constitute a major cause of treatment failure. We will test our central hypothesis
with three Specific Aims: 1) Identify clonal and subclonal mutations in ctDNA and their evolution during therapy;
2) Develop therapies for patients with ATRX mutant/ALT-driven indolent NB; and 3) Discover therapeutically
targetable mechanisms of NB cellular persistence. We will leverage circulating tumor DNA and single cell RNA
and ATAC sequencing technologies, as well as paradigm-shifting recent advancements in developing chimeric
antigen receptors that precisely target peptides presented on the major histocompatibility complex that have the
potential to vastly expand the pool of immunotherapeutic targets and broaden the population of patients who
would benefit from such therapy. In parallel, we will develop EZH2 inhibition therapy in combination with
immunotherapy for patients with indolent NB, and develop new therapies targeting the NF-κB and other pathways
mediating NB cellular persistence. We consider this project significant because it will result in new mechanism-
based biomarker-defined therapeutic strategies that ultimately should significantly improve high-risk NB patient
outcomes. This will address the major unmet need that despite unprecedented discoveries in defining the basic
mechanisms of NB tumorigenesis, this knowledge has not yet translated into significantly improved outcomes
for patients with high-risk disease."
10768923,"PROJECT 1 SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Epigenetic mechanisms drive normal development and unsurprisingly play critical roles in the pathogenesis and
treatment of neuroblastoma (NB), an embryonal neoplasm and the most common pediatric extracranial solid
tumor. Epigenetic plasticity has also emerged as an important mechanism of therapy resistance. Adrenergic
(ADR) and mesenchymal (MES) epigenetic states in NB cells are defined by differences in super-enhancer
landscapes and transcriptional programs. The MES state is associated with resistance to both chemotherapy
and targeted therapy, including resistance to inhibitors of the ALK tyrosine kinase receptor. We discovered that
the MES state is also associated with impaired responses to the immunotherapy dinutuximab, an FDA-approved
antibody directed against GD2, a glycolipid on the surface of NB cells. We found in vitro and in vivo, that
downregulation of GD2 is a major mechanism of resistance to GD2-directed therapies. We now propose multiple
approaches to study and target the MES state by pursuing strategies to manipulate the targets of current
therapies (e.g., GD2/dinutuximab) and by identifying liabilities present in MES NB cells. To this end, we
conducted a genome-scale CRISPR screen to identify genes that regulate surface GD2 levels in NB. Multiple
chromatin regulators scored, including all three members of the PRC2 complex (polycomb proteins EED and
SUZ12 and histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EZH2) and MEN1 encoding menin, a scaffolding protein that
interacts with the histone methyltransferases KMT2A/B (MLL1/2). We have already confirmed that the EZH2
inhibitor (EZH2-i) tazemetostat increases GD2 levels on NB cells in vitro and in vivo, improving preclinical
responses to dinutuximab. We hypothesize that chromatin modifying compounds will differentiate MES
NB models into an ADR-like state, thereby increasing expression of targets critical to both small
molecule inhibitors and to immunotherapies, leading to enhanced responses. In parallel, we have
conducted genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens to identify gene dependencies enriched in the MES versus
ADR states, and we will profile the peptides presented on MHC (immunopeptidome) in MES versus ADR cells
to identify additional targets for immunotherapies. We will deploy genetic and chemical genetic approaches and
develop novel and much needed isogenic, immunocompetent, genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM)
of MES and ADR NB to test this hypothesis.
Aim 1. Develop and characterize isogenic immunocompetent models of ADR versus MES NB.
Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that epigenetic modulators can increase expression of immunotherapy
targets in NB.
Aim 3. Identify novel combination therapeutic approaches to target the NB MES state.
The ultimate deliverable will be nomination of combination therapies with GD2- or other targeted treatments to
be tested by the NANT in children with NB.

Substance abuse and misuse pose significant costs to society and represent a global disease burden.
Relapse after a period of drug-free abstinence is one of the most profoundly debilitating aspects of addiction,
occurring in 40–80% of individuals. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of drug taking and relapse
will ultimately lead to better therapeutic interventions. The ventral striatum is a network of brain structures
implicated in compulsive drug-seeking and includes the ventral pallidum, nucleus accumbens (NAc), and
olfactory tubercle (OT). The OT, like the NAc, is a site of massive innervation of dopaminergic neuron
terminals from the ventral tegmental area in the midbrain. Rodents self-administer psychoactive substances
and electrical current into the OT, and more readily administer cocaine into the OT than even NAc. Further,
our lab has uncovered that the activity of OT neurons robustly reflects reward-guided behaviors and rewards.
Despite this evidence pointing towards a role for the OT in mediating reinforcement, little is known about the
OT, and at present, the OT is not included in mainstream models of the reward system. The short-term goal
of this project is to build off both our published and unpublished studies positioning the OT in the reward
circuitry to determine mechanisms whereby the OT exerts control over cocaine seeking and taking. Our overall
hypothesis is that there is a functional organization amongst ventral striatum subregions which influences
drug seeking. There are three aims to be executed by our collaborative team of experts in addiction
neurobiology, synaptic neurobiology, and in vivo physiology and behavior. First, we will use brain slice
recordings to determine the circuitry which connects the OT with the ventral tegmental area and ventral
striatum structures. Second, we will use in vivo physiological methods to demonstrate manners whereby OT
neurons, including OT medium spiny neurons, represent drug seeking. Finally, we will employ cell-specific
optogenetic methods to determine the regulation of reinforcement and drug-seeking by OT neurons. The
results of this project will answer long-standing questions about the fundamental circuitry of the OT and its
significance in the context of motivated behavior and drug-seeking. Together this project will contribute to our
long-term goal of generating a more complete model of the brain’s reward system."
10769767,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Night shift work is common in the current 24-hour global society and is increasingly recognized as a risk factor
for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). However, we know very little about the
persistence, recovery from, or pathways through which shift work contributes to AD/ADRD. Neuronal
metabolic decline (i.e., disrupted brain bioenergetics) contributes to AD/ADRD development and progression,
and the repeated sleep and circadian disruptions in shift work compromise peripheral energy metabolism. This
K01 proposal will advance these findings by comparing indices of Alzheimer’s disease risk and brain
bioenergetics between retired night shift workers and retired day workers. N = 40 participants (n = 20 retired
night shift workers, n = 20 retired day workers) ages 65-80 from an established cohort will perform
neurocognitive assessments (e.g., episodic memory, executive function) and 7 Tesla neuroimaging. Structural
magnetic resonance imaging will assess hippocampal, posterior cingulate cortex, and retrosplenial cortex
volume and phosphorous magnetic spectroscopy will assess brain bioenergetics, including adenosine
triphosphate, phosphocreatine, and inorganic phosphate. This study will compare retired night shift workers
and retired day workers on cognitive function, brain volume, and brain bioenergetics, and will examine the
association of brain bioenergetics with brain volume among retired night shift workers. To conduct this
research, Dr. Lehrer will pursue a program of training that will advance his knowledge and skills in the
assessment of Alzheimer’s disease-related cognitive function, brain structure, and neurobiology (i.e.,
bioenergetics and AD-specific proteinopathy). He will also learn how to integrate these methods into his
emerging program of sleep and circadian rhythm and AD/ADRD research. This training, along with findings
from the proposed study, will allow Dr. Lehrer to launch his career as an independent investigator studying the
role that long-term sleep and circadian disruption plays in Alzheimer’s disease to inform impactful prevention
efforts for retired night shift workers. Study findings could influence our approach to AD/ADRD risk among
current and former shift workers, leading to early identification of at-risk individuals at the conclusion of, or
even during a career in shift work. Results will inform future studies using experimental approaches to test
causal relationships, inform development and dissemination of interventions, and elucidate precision medicine
approaches to prevent and attenuate the clinical course of AD/ADRD. Such interventions may include
potentially modifiable behavioral (e.g., sleep and circadian rhythm enhancement) and pharmacological (e.g.,
bioenergetics-boosting compounds) therapies for AD/ADRD intervention and/or prevention. The proposed
study will generate public health-relevant data that will help to reduce AD/ADRD risk and inform behavioral
and bioenergetics-focused therapies to prevent and mitigate the clinical course of Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias among a large portion of current and former U.S. workers."
10769806,"Summary
 As biotechnology advances, biomedical investigations have become more complex due to high-throughput and
high-dimensional data collected at a genomic scale. Of paramount importance is unraveling the regulatory roles
of genetic variants on genes and gene-to-gene regulatory relationships. On this ground, biomedical researchers
can identify causal Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes for complex traits and neurodegenerative
diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) to develop treatment strategies. Given the urgent need to under-
stand the progression and etiology of these diseases, particularly AD, the PIs propose to develop statistical and
computational tools for accurate estimation and inference of gene regulatory networks, with a focus on AD and
other complex traits.
 The project consists of two major components: estimation and inference of gene regulatory networks with
SNPs as instrumental variables (IVs). The main thrust will be on causal network reconstruction and inference
with IVs as interventions in the possible presence of invalid IVs and hidden confounders, with particular effort
on high-dimensional data, in which the number of variables may exceed the sample size. Concerning causal
network reconstruction, the project will develop novel methods of reconstructing gene regulatory networks as
directed acyclic graphs describing casual relationships among the SNPs (interventions), genes, and traits such
as AD. The project will develop high-dimensional inferential tools based on modiﬁed likelihood ratio tests and a
data perturbation scheme to account for the uncertainty involved in a discovery process. Moreover, it will focus
on hypothesis testing on (1) the directionality and strength of multiple (linear/nonlinear) causal relations and (2)
the presence of a pathway of causal relations. Computationally, the project will develop innovative methods and
algorithms for large-scale problems. For application, based on the reconstructed gene regulatory networks, we
will ﬁrst identify causal genes for AD and AD's risk factors, such as lipids, then infer which of the risk factors are
(putatively) causal to AD."
10769808,"Blood pressure (BP) measured in the office is used to diagnose hypertension and guide BP management for
adults taking antihypertensive medication. Guidelines recommend measuring BP outside of the office using
ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) or home BP monitoring (HBPM) to confirm office BP, averaged across
multiple visits. The evidence supporting this recommendation is weak since most prior studies compared BP
on ABPM or HBPM against office BP measured at a single visit. Guidelines also recommend that ABPM be
performed over a 24-hour period and HBPM be based on 2 measurements in the morning (AM) and 2
measurements in the evening (PM) for 7 days. Many guidelines endorse ABPM as the reference standard for
out-of-office BP monitoring, but there are few data comparing ABPM to HBPM conducted for 7 days. We
recently completed a study of 400 adults that compared BP measured during 3 office visits, on ABPM, and
HBPM, each conducted following guideline-recommended approaches. The study found (1) BP on HBPM was
associated with left ventricular mass index (LVMI), a marker of target end-organ damage, independent of office
BP and BP on ABPM, (2) office BP and BP on ABPM were not associated with LVMI, independent of BP on
HBPM, (3) HBPM was more reliable (i.e. reproducible) than ABPM and office BP, and (4) office BP was more
reliable than ABPM. These results suggest a new paradigm that HBPM is superior to ABPM and office
BP, and ABPM is not needed when office BP and HBPM are both performed. However, no one in this
study was taking antihypertensive medication, few older adults were enrolled, and a minority had high office
BP. These findings need to be tested in a larger study with broader generalizability. We propose to enroll 1,696
adults in New York, NY, Birmingham, AL, and Los Angeles, CA with screening systolic/diastolic BP <160/100
mm Hg; 50% of whom will be taking antihypertensive medication. The sample will be diverse based on age
(33% in each age group: 18-39, 40-59, and ≥60 years), sex (50% women), race/ethnicity (≥25% non-Hispanic
white, ≥25% non-Hispanic Black, ≥25% Hispanic, and ≥10% Asian), and office BP level (50% with office BP
≥130/80 mm Hg). Office BP will be measured at 3 visits. ABPM will be performed over two 24-hour periods and
HBPM will be performed with 2 AM and 2 PM measurements per day over two 7-day periods. Two markers of
target end-organ damage – LVMI on echocardiogram and albumin-to-creatinine ratio – will be assessed. We
will determine whether BP on HBPM is more strongly associated with target end-organ damage than office BP
and awake BP on ABPM (Primary Aim 1). We will determine if HBPM is more reliable than office BP and
awake BP on ABPM (Primary Aim 2). We will also determine whether the findings are consistent using asleep
BP and 24-hour BP instead of awake BP, and investigate potential differences among age, sex, and
race/ethnicity subgroups (Secondary Aims). The study will determine the best approach to measure BP for
diagnosing and managing hypertension, which has the potential to improve the health of millions of US adults."

The unifying goal of this program project is to define the biological function of noncoding RNAs in

10825608,"Project Summary and Abstract for the SEAL (Stopping Eczema and ALlergy) Study
 Food allergy (FA) is an epidemic among children in the U.S., U.K., and other countries. There is increasing
evidence that epicutaneous allergen sensitization through a dysfunctional skin barrier results in allergic
responses whereas early consumption of food allergens induces oral tolerance, as described by the dual
allergen exposure hypothesis. In the Learning Early About Peanut LEAP and Enquiring About Tolerance (EAT)
studies, dry skin and the severity and the duration of eczema or atopic dermatitis (AD) in the 1st year of life
were predictors of peanut allergy (PA) and sensitization. In the SEAL study, we aim to intervene very early in a
high-risk infant group, as soon they have the earliest onset of dry skin or eczema in the 1st 10 weeks of life,
but before they have developed allergies. By reducing the duration and severity of eczema and preventing
eczema exacerbations, we aim to prevent epicutaneous allergen sensitization and significantly reduce the
incidence of FA. Our primary objective is to test if the combination of trilipid skin emollient use early in life with
proactive topical steroids decreases the prevalence of FA compared to controls.
 We propose a randomized (1:1), controlled trial design for infants with dry skin or eczema (n=750 total) to
compare the effect of proactive treatment against a reactive treatment group for the prevention of FA, by
reducing dry skin, and the severity and duration of eczema in early infancy. We will test our hypothesis with the
following specific aims using world-class clinical research units known for excellent recruitment and retention of
patient cohorts, mechanistic testing, and state of the art research. Specific Aim 1: To determine if proactive
versus reactive treatment will reduce the occurrence of FA in a prospective, randomized, and controlled
intervention trial of infants with eczema. Specific Aim 2: To test whether the skin of children in the proactive
treatment will show improved epithelial barrier markers with increased commensal bacteria colonization.
Specific Aim 3: To determine whether proactive treatment will be associated with protective immune
responses. If the aims are achieved, our proposal will make a clinical impact by providing a new, clinical
strategy to prevent the occurrence of FA in young infants that present with the earliest signs of dry skin or
eczema."
11048301,"Project Summary and Abstract for the SEAL (Stopping Eczema and ALlergy) Study
 Food allergy (FA) is an epidemic among children in the U.S., U.K., and other countries. There is increasing
evidence that epicutaneous allergen sensitization through a dysfunctional skin barrier results in allergic
responses whereas early consumption of food allergens induces oral tolerance, as described by the dual
allergen exposure hypothesis. In the Learning Early About Peanut LEAP and Enquiring About Tolerance (EAT)
studies, dry skin and the severity and the duration of eczema or atopic dermatitis (AD) in the 1st year of life
were predictors of peanut allergy (PA) and sensitization. In the SEAL study, we aim to intervene very early in a
high-risk infant group, as soon they have the earliest onset of dry skin or eczema in the 1st 10 weeks of life,
but before they have developed allergies. By reducing the duration and severity of eczema and preventing
eczema exacerbations, we aim to prevent epicutaneous allergen sensitization and significantly reduce the
incidence of FA. Our primary objective is to test if the combination of trilipid skin emollient use early in life with

The Health Equity Academic Research in Pediatric Hospital Medicine (HEAR-PHM) Program will build capacity
to address disparities across the acute care continuum by both delivering a health equity research curriculum
to pediatric hospitalists and supporting a diverse academic workforce within Pediatric Hospital Medicine
(PHM). Disparities have been identified across the spectrum of care and conditions for the hospitalized child.
Although responses to address disparities in pediatric care need to be multi-factorial, key strategies include
developing expertise in health equity research and fostering a more diverse academic workforce. A dedicated
focus on increasing diversity in the pediatric workforce has been identified as a national priority. Cultural make-
up of the United States is changing, and data from the US Census Bureau projects by 2060 only one-third of
US children will be non-Hispanic white. Developing and maintaining a diverse academic pediatric workforce is
an important aspect to improve health outcomes in populations underrepresented in medicine (URiM). PHM is
a young subspeciality that has opportunities to address health inequities for hospitalized children and needs
specialized health equity research training. To address this critical gap, HEAR-PHM seeks to: 1) Prepare PHM
scholars (fellows and junior faculty) to lead health equity research in the care of hospitalized children. The
scholars will be equipped with a background in health equity research skills, and support completion of an
impactful, rigorous capstone research project focus on child health equity; 2) Enhance the diversity of PHM
scholars. We will recruit URiM scholars from a national applicant pool, with attention to diversity in clinical and
academic backgrounds, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and sex/gender preference; 3) Build a repository
of health-equity research resources to support the train-the-trainer model for PHM scholars. We will develop an
online platform to support the health-equity research lectures, develop a toolkit for scholars to train others, and
provide opportunities for scholars to share their experiences and knowledge locally and nationally. Children’s
National Hospital (CNH) is well-position to lead this national program as it is one of the oldest and largest PHM
programs in the country, and CNH has long-standing expertise in medical education, translational research,
and community-based programs. HEAR-PHM program directors are national PHM leaders with strong
reputation as educators and researchers, and program scholars will leave the program with enhanced health
equity research capabilities related to the mission of NICHD."

 This new T32 research training program will provide postdoctoral fellows training in sleep and circadian
research. It builds on a prior highly successful postdoctoral training program and is part of a comprehensive
succession plan for T32 leadership at the University of Pennsylvania. The fellows can have PhD, MD, VMD, or
MD/PhD degrees. The program provides support for each fellow for up to three years to provide the training they
require to reach the next level of career advancement. The program is broad in scope. It is organized into specific
tracks, each of which has a number of faculty who can act as mentors. The specific tracks are as follows: a)
basic research in sleep and circadian mechanisms; b) clinical/translational research in sleep and its disorders;
c) personalized medicine approaches that include development of biomarkers, genetics of complex traits, and
big data approaches using electronic health records (EHR). Each track has relevant didactic courses and there
are multiple Masters degree programs that fellows can pursue. There are also organized programs to teach
academic survival skills—grant writing, giving scientific talks, and negotiating for a position. The program also
offers the ability to collaborate with faculty at other institutions including Jackson Laboratory (mouse genetics),
Geisinger Clinic (big data, genetics), and Kaiser Southern California (big data approaches). Penn developed the
first medical-school wide center to facilitate sleep/circadian research in 1991 and the first multidisciplinary Sleep
Medicine Division in 2001. These developments have led to Penn training the largest number of successful
investigators in sleep/circadian research of any institution in the world. The program takes advantage of the
infrastructure that has been developed at Penn over the past 30 years for research training. This includes the
Office of Biomedical Postdoctoral Programs (BPP), the Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology, the Master
of Science in Translational Research, and the Master of Science in Biomedical Informatics."
10768958,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The decrease in the number of physician-scientists has been widely recognized as a major threat to biomedical
research, and there has been an even more dramatic decrease in the number of surgeon-scientists. The
Department of Surgery at Washington University School of Medicine is one of the nation's leading academic
surgery departments and is currently ranked #2 in NIH funding by the Blue Ridge Medical Institute. The
Department has a strong and uncompromising commitment to training academic surgeon-scientists. The
Surgical Oncology Basic Science and Translational Research Training Program is a critical component of this
overall training goal. NCI support will provide a diverse cadre of up to eight surgical trainees from general
surgery and other surgical subspecialties the opportunity to develop essential skill sets in basic science,
translational, public health, and/or disparities research. The Surgical Oncology Research Training Program has
evolved in parallel with a dynamic training environment at WUSM, and currently takes advantage of unique
resources in the Department of Surgery, Siteman Cancer Center, the Department of Surgery's Division of
Public Health Sciences, and the Institute of Clinical and Translational Sciences to develop customized and
highly structured formal didactic and mentored research experiences for individual T32 Program Scholars. The
success of the Program is demonstrated by the long-term success of T32 Program Scholars in academic
surgery. 24 of 32 Scholars (75%) who have completed the Program and clinical training in the last fifteen years
remain in academic medicine, significantly better than published metrics (16-44%). Similarly, 7 of 32 Scholars
(22%) who have completed the Program and clinical training in the last fifteen years have independent
research funding, significantly better than published metrics (1.0-2.5%). The Surgical Oncology Research
Training Program continues to evolve. Changes include changes to the program leadership, development of
two distinct research tracks (basic science track, and translational research/public health/clinical effectiveness
track), development of program-specific Work-in-Progress and Professional Development Seminar Series, and
a formal mentoring training program. These changes will ensure that the Surgical Oncology Research Training
Program will continue to maintain excellence at the forefront of two different surgical oncology research
paradigms, basic science research, and translational/public health/clinical effectiveness/disparities research.
The WUSM General Surgery residency is ranked #5 in the nation, and we have an outstanding applicant pool.
We proactively recruit T32 Program Scholars from diverse backgrounds. 51% of T32 Program Scholars in the
last 15 years are women and 16% are from groups underrepresented in medicine (URiM) (significantly more
diverse than the pool from which they are recruited). NCI support will allow WUSM to continue to provide the
next generation of surgeon-scientists with the research training required to succeed in an increasingly
competitive research environment."
10769191,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The mission of the Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program (Tri-I) is to train a diverse and empowered group of
clinician-scientists prepared to bridge the gap between laboratory research and clinical medicine. Graduates of
the program are well-grounded in human biology, pathophysiology, and clinical medicine and are endowed with
an advanced understanding of biomedical science, as well as a mastery of critical thinking and experimental
skills. These skills will allow them to undertake complex, interdisciplinary, quantitative, and collaborative studies
to elucidate basic biological processes pertaining to human health and disease and to transfer advances in
research to the understanding, prevention, and treatment of human disease. Tri-I is a joint undertaking between
Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM), The Rockefeller University (RU), and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
(MSK). Trainees complete their MD degree at Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC), and PhD training at one
of the three participating graduate schools: Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences (WCGS); the
David Rockefeller Graduate Program in Bioscience at RU; or the Louis V. Gerstner Jr. Graduate School of
Biomedical Sciences (GSK) at MSK. An integrated curriculum reinforces the students’ identities as clinician-
scientists. In the first two years in the program, MD-PhD-specific graduate-level coursework, including training
in quantitative methods, responsible conduct of research, and rigor and reproducibility, is integrated with pre-
clinical medical school courses and 18 weeks of core clinical clerkships. Students complete three laboratory
research rotations in at least two different institutions before selecting a thesis lab and enrolling in the graduate
school at which their thesis mentor has their primary appointment. PhD requirements are comparable for all MD-
PhD students across graduate institutions, and trainees may take courses for credit in any of the graduate
schools. After they have defended their thesis, trainees complete their remaining clinical training at WCMC. Over
200 participating faculty members serve as mentors and undergo training to ensure a safe training environment,
responsible conduct of research, and scientific rigor and reproducibility. Students receive multi-layered
mentorship and advising, particularly around transitions to and from the laboratory and in preparation for post-
graduate residency training. Based on Tri-I’s high trainee retention in the program and in academia and
biomedical research following graduation, this application requests funds to support 49 trainees per year. No
trainee will be appointed to the grant for more than a total of four years. The student body averages 150 MD-
PhD trainees; currently, 47% identify as women and 23% come from racial and ethnic backgrounds
underrepresented in medicine and science. Over the past 50 years, 451 MD-PhDs have graduated from Tri-I
and its predecessors. In the past 15 years, 85% of graduates have appointments in medical schools, research
institutes, or biotech/pharma. Tri-I is committed to maintaining its longstanding tradition of training future leaders
of biomedical research."
10770999,"Project Summary
Eukaryotic RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcribes ribosomal RNA, a key component of ribosomes. Pol I transcription
accounts for the majority of the total RNA in cells, and its upregulation in human cells is a hallmark of cancer while
its downregulation is a hallmark of several developmental disorders. Pol I transcription is understudied compared
to transcription by Pol II and even Pol III. Our preliminary work suggests fundamental differences between Pol I
and Pols II and III that are the basis for this proposal. Our broad long-term objectives are to determine the molecular
mechanism of Pol I transcription and how its dysregulation leads to cancer and developmental disorders. There
are major gaps in our understanding of (1) the structural organization and architecture of Pol I transcription
complexes; (2) the mechanism for how Pol I initiation factors interact with rDNA, which encodes ribosomal RNA;
and (3) the molecular function of several key Pol I transcription factors in the activation process. The first rationale
for this work is that determining the mechanism and regulation of Pol I transcription will form the molecular basis
for understanding how Pol I defects lead to human disease. Our central hypothesis is that Pol I factors use a
unique mechanism to carry out transcription and their structure and function is different from the mechanisms
governing Pol II and III transcription. The second rationale is that understanding the Pol I transcription mechanism
at the most basic and fundamental levels will translate to a better understanding of the connection between Pol I
and cancer, leading to new cancer therapeutic strategies. Our proposed research will use a conceptually and
technically innovative cross-organismal and interdisciplinary approach that employs a combination of bioinformatic,
computational, molecular, biochemical, genetic, genomic, proteomic, and structural methods in the yeast and
human cells. Guided by strong preliminary studies, we will test two specific aims: (1) Determine the unique
“coactivator” role of TATA-binding protein (TBP) in Pol I transcription, and (2) Determine the mechanism of Pol I
transcription activation. To accomplish these aims, we will use well-established and complementary approaches
to identify and map novel Pol I interactions in their native context. We will complement these studies with structural
modeling in combination with molecular, genetic, and biochemical functional assays to identify Pol I factor functions
conserved from yeast to humans. The proposed research is significant because it will lead to a detailed description
of the Pol I transcription mechanism and will provide a conceptual framework for understanding the link between
Pol I and human disease. Ultimately, this work will illuminate new avenues for diagnosis, potential interventions,
and the development of therapies targeting these novel protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions."
10768858,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited disorder where clusters of cysts
develop in the kidneys. Still, despite being most often caused by mutations in PKD1 or PKD2 (encoding the
polycystin 1, PC1, and polycystin 2, PC2, proteins, respectively), disease presentation is phenotypically
heterogeneous. Most ADPKD patients have reduced quality and length of life, and while tolvaptan was
approved as the first and only ADPKD therapy, it does not cure ADPKD, shows no benefit for other PKD
manifestations, is associated with liver toxicity, and is expensive. Novel approaches to identifying and
prioritizing ADPKD biomarkers and therapeutic candidates are desperately needed. Mitochondrial dysfunction
and preference for aerobic glycolysis (i.e., the Warburg effect) over oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos) are
suggested hallmarks of ADPKD based on both animal models and ADPKD patient tissue studies.
Mitochondrial differences have been shown broadly to account for much of the observed variation in gene
expression, alternative splicing (also known to promote the Warburg effect), translation, and, ultimately, protein
levels. Intriguingly, in PKD kidney tissues and single-cell profiles, thousands of genes are differentially
expressed, the PC1-PC2 complex can regulate oxphos directly by mediating mitochondrial calcium uptake and
indirectly through multiple mechanisms (e.g., maintaining mitochondrial DNA copy number, mtCN), and
mitochondrial abnormalities have been shown to promote cyst formation and act as a modifier of disease
progression. We anticipate that similar to other conditions where mitochondria have central disease
pathogenesis roles, cell-specific mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic reprogramming, and transcriptional
diversity are critical for renal cystogenesis and progression and are suitable disease biomarkers and
therapeutic targets. With innovative genomics and data science approaches, we will profile ADPKD mouse
model kidney tissue and patient urinary cells with mitochondrial single-cell ATAC-Seq (mtscATAC-Seq) and
long-read single-cell RNA-Seq (lrscRNA-Seq). We will test the hypotheses that a greater number of cell types
and proportion of cells are impacted by mitochondria dysfunction in rapidly compared to slowly progressive
ADPKD (Aim 1) and that proximal tubular cell alternative gene splicing and glycolysis and oxphos molecular
signatures distinguish slow from rapidly progressive ADPKD (Aim 2). This proposal is responsive to the Katz
program, does not include unpublished data, and targets research different from the Lasseigne Lab’s previous
focus and training (i.e., mitochondrial and metabolic contributions to disease, kidney cyst pathophysiology). In
addition to depositing all data in GEO and hosting version-controlled code with a digital object identifier on
Zenodo, we will develop an interactive web application to make the ADPKD mtscATAC-Seq and lrscRNA-Seq
maps widely available. Collectively these studies have the potential to transform unmet clinical ADPKD needs
by prioritizing biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and prioritizing precision-targeted therapeutics."
10770372,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are critical adaptor molecules that physically link amino acids to codons, decoding mRNA
transcripts during translation. The mammalian genome contains hundreds of tRNA genes which are classified
into families based on their anticodon. Each family contains multiple tRNA genes, suggesting that these genes
may be buffered against the impact of deleterious mutations. Recently, we have demonstrated that a mutation
that impairs processing of n-Tr20, a tRNAArgUCU gene, or its complete loss, alters gene expression and
physiological responses at both the cellular and organismal level, despite the existence of four additional,
functional tRNAArgUCU genes in the mouse genome. More specifically, loss of this highly expressed, neuron-
specific member of the tRNAArgUCU family decreases the susceptibility of mice to seizures and alters the
excitatory-inhibitory balance in the hippocampus. Loss of n-Tr20 leads to ribosome stalling on cognate AGA
codons, along with changes in the transcriptional and translational landscape, characterized by decreased
mTORC1 signaling and activation of the integrated stress response. Transgenic overexpression of the other
members of the tRNAArgUCU family genes restored seizure susceptibility, in a manner which correlated with the
level of tRNA expression from the transgene, suggesting that the phenotypes in n-Tr20-/- mice are due to a
decrease in the tRNAArgUCU neuronal pool, to which n-Tr20 is the major contributor.
Our results provide the first demonstration that mutation of an individual member of a multicopy, nuclear-encoded
tRNA family can alter the molecular landscape and physiology of neurons and provide an impetus for future
investigations of tRNA mutations in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and in disease. This proposal
expands upon our findings in several ways. In Aim 1, we will determine the cellular mechanisms underlying the
altered excitatory-inhibitory balance upon n-Tr20 loss by conditionally deleting n-Tr20 in either inhibitory or
excitatory neurons during or post-development. We will also investigate the effect of genetically increasing
mTOR signaling in n-Tr20-/- neurons on synaptic transmission. To further understand these physiological
changes, we will analyze the translatome in excitatory and inhibitory neurons of n-Tr20-/- and wild-type mice and
determine whether n-Tr20 deletion disrupts local translation. In Aim 2, we will test our hypothesis that phenotypes
derived from tRNA loss are due to the decreased level of the pool of tRNAs with the same anticodon, and we
will investigate whether the identity of the depleted tRNA family impacts these phenotypes. We will perform ChIP-
Seq from several major cell types in the brain, utilizing a novel mouse model that can conditionally express an
epitope-tagged allele of RNA Polymerase III. Based on this data, we will identify and delete other highly
expressed tRNAs and investigate the effect of their loss on major cell types in the mouse brain. Finally, we will
extend our work into humans by investigating the impact of tRNA loss on the translatome and physiology of
iPSC-derived neurons."
10770373,"Peripheral neuropathy, the most prevalent chronic complication of diabetes may affect up to 50% of
patients and critically contributes to increased pain and risk of amputations, lower physical
functioning, increased daily living burden, reduced quality of life, increased health care costs, and high
mortality risk. Although intensive glucose control was shown to delay the onset and progression of
diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in patients with type 1 diabetes, similar evidence is not available
for the very vast majority of patients who have type 2 diabetes (T2D). In spite of continuous research
a disease modifying therapy to reverse human DPN is still not available. Work in our laboratories has
provided evidence that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) found in fish oil in combination
with salsalate may be an effective treatment for DPN. Our pre-clinical studies have shown that fish oil
and salsalate slows progression of DPN and initiates nerve damage repair and reverses DPN . We
have also demonstrated that E and D series resolvins, metabolites of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)
and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), respectively, reverses DPN to a similar extent as fish oil. These
data provides the rationale to advance the fish oil-salsalate combination to DPN clinical trials. The
studies proposed in this application are the first step in this endeavor. Using participants with T2D and
DPN we will initially establish the most efficient dose of fish oil that will increase the omega-3 index
(defined as the sum of EPA and DHA, as a percentage of total fatty acids in red blood cells) to at least
8 – 12% presumed to be therapeutic. Next, we will combine fish oil and salsalate to examine their
effect on the production of pro-resolving metabolites derived from EPA and DHA. We hypothesize that
fish oil in a concentration dependent manner will increase the omega-3 index to therapeutic levels
independent of salsalate. We also hypothesize that combining fish oil and salsalate vs. fish oil alone
will more effectively increase the circulating pro-resolving mediators of omega-3 PUFA and reduce
markers of inflammation to a greater extent than fish oil alone. The lipidomics of omega-3 PUFA in
human subjects has been understudied and not at all in subjects with diabetes and DPN. Limited
studies in normal human subjects taking fish oil have demonstrated considerable variability in
circulating levels of omega-3 PUFA and this variability could have an impact on their metabolic fate.
The studies proposed will address this limitation and guide us in selecting the most effective and safe
combination dose of fish oil and salsalate for increasing the omega-3 index to a therapeutic level and
maximize production of pro-resolving lipid mediators. This will lead to design of a disease modifying
trial for DPN, with the potential to improve the quality of life for all patients with diabetes. The excellent
safety profiles of fish oil and salsalate make them an attractive choice for long-term clinical use."
10770537,"Interest in the use of optical imaging instruments in medical interventions stems from their ease of use, rapid
adaptation to clinical needs, portability, real-time feedback, and relatively low cost. Of particular interest is the
role of optical imaging in oncology. Surgery is the primary curative method for solid tumors confined to the tissue
of origin with the goal of completely removing both the tumor mass and microscopic lesions. Unfortunately, the
irregular growth pattern and infiltrations into surrounding healthy tissue prevent complete removal in many cases,
resulting in positive surgical margins (PSMs). PSMs are prevalent in oncologic surgery, increasing cancer
recurrence rates and often necessitates a second surgery to improve disease-specific survival. While PSM
occurrence is significant in advanced clinical centers, the situation is worse in many rural hospitals and resource-
limited areas due to limited histology infrastructure and workforce needed for margin assessment. Thus there is
an urgent need for an intraoperative imaging system to visualize cancer, guide tumor removal, and determine
margin positivity in the operating room (OR) in low and high resource settings alike.
 Handheld fluorescence imaging systems have been developed to aid cancer resection. Still, they suffer from
several limitations, including a significant footprint in the OR and the inability of the operating surgeon to directly
control the imaging device while performing surgery. To address these shortcomings, we developed a head-
mounted display device (HMD) cancer imaging system for real-time intraoperative fluorescence-guided surgery
(FGS). The system HMD captures near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and color images from the surgical bed and
displays accurately aligned color-NIR images in real-time, enabling FGS without disrupting surgical workflow.
The HMD has a small footprint, is intuitive to use, and is amenable for widespread use, including non-cancer
applications such as imaging of peripheral blood flow. Preliminary testing of the HMD system in human cancer
patients identified some areas for improvement that will accelerate the eventual clinical adoption of the system
worldwide. Addressing these needs requires expertise in packaging software development for medical devices
with DICOM image format and user interface development using human factors engineering. We have teamed
up with a company that has both expertise and experience in developing augmented reality/mixed reality
(AR/VR) software combined with deep machine learning in wearable devices on this project. Together, we will
optimize the system performance and ergonomics using human factors engineering. The collaborative project
will (1) develop and validate an automated fluorescence thresholding algorithm for tumor delineation; (2) develop
and validate automated registration of augmented reality in the system; and (3) develop and evaluate clinical
software to improve user experience.
 At the completion of this project, we expect to develop and validate a clinic-ready, user-friendly HMD system
with a small hardware footprint, enabling seamless integration with surgical workflow to enhance clinical
adoption. The system will increase the rates and decrease the time of successful tumor resection. Anticipated
low cost and ease of use will expand adoption in low and high resource settings worldwide. This objective
approach to cancer surgery will reduce the incidence of PSMs and improve treatment outcomes."
10770412,"Allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) is the only curative therapy for many pediatric patients
with malignant and non-malignant disorders. Unfortunately, treatment-related complications remain a major
barrier to successful outcomes. A multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) workshop convened by the
NICHD in March 2015 identified respiratory failure, the delivery of cytotoxic therapies and complications
associated with allo-BMT as three distinct contributors to MODS and death in pediatric patients. The
significance of respiratory failure occurring after BMT was recently underscored by a June 2018 NIH workshop
specifically convened to identify clinical challenges and scientific knowledge gaps regarding pulmonary
dysfunction after BMT in pediatric patients. Hence, the development of novel strategies that reduce the
incidence and severity of pulmonary dysfunction after allo-BMT remains a significant unmet need. Idiopathic
pneumonia syndrome (IPS) is a frequently fatal form of lung injury occurring after BMT. Progress has been
made to understand the mechanisms responsible for IPS; the Cooke lab discovered that TNFα contributes
directly to vascular endothelial cell (EC) injury and regulates the subsequent influx of donor cells into the lung.
These insights lead to several clinical trials testing the effects of etanercept (a dimeric TNFα binding protein) in
BMT-recipients with IPS. While successful, not all patients respond to etanercept revealing a critical need for
continued research. Proteomic evaluation of plasma sample revealed striking similarities between human and
experimental IPS and identified protein candidates that associate with EC injury and disease onset. Additional
studies revealed a here-to-fore unknown association between IPS and the protein angiopoietin (Ang)-2. Ang-1
and Ang-2 are peptide ligands for the receptor tyrosine kinase, Tie-2 and represent an agonist / antagonist pair
that regulate EC integrity. Moreover, Ang-2 sensitizes ECs to TNFα and regulates TNFα-induced adhesion
molecule expression. Hence a significant body of pre-clinical and clinical data provides the basis for the
following central hypothesis: During inflammation early after allo-BMT, the Ang1:Ang2 pathways regulate
cytokine-mediated EC activation and integrity, increased adhesion molecule expression, and development of
IPS. Pertinent to this application, EC damage and dysfunction is a common-thread among several BMT-related
complications including IPS, graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver all of
which contribute to MODS after BMT. Independent biomarker data also suggest that biologic pathways
contributing to EC injury and leak during IPS are likely operative during the development of GVHD and VOD as
well. The translational research potential of this application is therefore significant: Proposed experiments will
enhance our understanding of how inflammation after transplant contributes to vascular EC injury and organ
dysfunction with great potential to reduce the risk and severity of MODS in pediatric BMT recipients and
thereby improve outcomes and broaden the utility of this powerful form of cellular therapy to children in need."
10749895,"Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1), an autonomous human parvovirus, causes acute respiratory tract infections in young children. HBoV1 is unique among all small DNA viruses in that it expresses a noncoding RNA of 140 nucleotides from the 3' noncoding region after the capsid protein-coding region. This bocavirus-encoded small RNA (BocaSR) is exclusively expressed in the nucleus and plays an important role both in expression of viral nonstructural proteins and in viral DNA replication. HBoV1 infects and replicates in terminally-differentiated human airway epithelium cultured at an air-liquid interface (HAE-ALI), mimicking natural infection of human airways. Importantly, HBoV1 genome replication in the nondividing airway epithelial cells utilizes error-free Y- family DNA repair DNA polymerase (Pol) η and Pol κ, and BocaSR specifically interacts with viral nonstructural proteins. On the other hand, HBoV1 is a helper virus for the replication of adeno-associated virus (AAV) in HAE-ALI, and BocaSR also plays a key role in facilitating AAV Rep gene expression and DNA replication. Our central hypothesis is that HBoV1 has evolved to express a noncoding RNA to facilitate expression of the viral nonstructural proteins and their function in licensing viral DNA replication, which mimics a DNA repair process driven by error-free Pol η and Pol κ. In this application, we aim to reveal the mechanisms underlying the BocaSR-regulated expression of viral nonstructural proteins and viral DNA replication in the nucleus, and to understand the viral manipulation of the error-free Pol η and Pol κ in DNA synthesis. The BocaSR is novel as it is the first one found among all small DNA viruses and differs from other known RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcribed viral noncoding RNAs by its unique properties in regulating viral gene expression and playing a direct role in viral DNA replication in the nucleus. Studying BocaSR-regulating parvovirus replication will contribute to the understanding of the functions of other viral noncoding RNAs in virus replication. In addition, knowledge in how parvovirus employs the DNA repair machinery for viral genome replication in nondividing cells will help us understand how a small DNA virus overcomes the barrier to replicate its genome outside of the cell cycle. Dissecting the viral and host determinants of HBoV1 genome replication will help the development of therapeutic approaches to prevent acute respiratory tract infections caused by HBoV1. Finally, deep understanding AAV DNA replication will help find a better way to produce recombinant AAV (rAAV) vector and to increase the efficacy of rAAV gene delivery, in particular, to nondividing cells."
10749897,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is an aggressive disease impacting about 50,000 deaths annually in the
USA. Patients with metastatic CRC are predominantly unresponsive to existing therapies. The metastatic
process is mediated in part by dysregulated translation of oncogenic mRNAs, leading to overproduction of their
encoded proteins. Previous findings established dysregulation of cap-dependent mRNA translation downstream
of mTOR at the level of 4E-BP1/eIF4E as a key to tumor formation and metastatic progression in CRC. While
targeting mTOR is thought to be a promising strategy for CRC therapy, limited therapeutic efficacy of mTOR
inhibitor drugs correlates largely with loss of the translation repressive function of 4E-BP1. More recent findings
indicate that Snail acts as a strong repressor of 4E-BP1 transcription and cooperates with mTOR-mediated
phosphorylation (inactivation) of 4E-BP1 to significantly increase eIF4E-initiated cap-dependent mRNA
translation. These processes support tumor growth and decrease the efficacy of the mTOR kinase (ATP-
competitive) inhibitors (mTORkis) in CRC therapy. Although mTORkis effectively inhibit phosphorylation of 4E-
BP1 and restore its repressive effects on cap-dependent translation and tumor growth, treatment with mTORkis
in CRC cells can promote the active translation and expression of the immunosuppressive protein PD-L1 via
initiation at an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in a cap-independent manner. In addition, the RNA helicase
eIF4A is a key PD-L1 IRES binding protein that regulates its translation and expression. Importantly, elevated
PD-L1 levels induced by mTORkis result in evasion of anti-CRC immunity. Further, targeted inhibition of PD-L1
can restore T-cell immunity and enhance the efficacy of mTORkis. Based on these findings, the central
hypothesis of the proposed study is that CRC cells usurp the regulatory mechanisms underlying both cap-
dependent translation through co-activation of Snail and mTOR and IRES-mediated translation of PD-L1 to
escape immune surveillance in mTOR kinase-targeted therapy, thereby causing CRC resistance to mTORkis
and promoting CRC progression. To test this hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed: 1) to identify
how Snail cooperates with mTOR in translational control of CRC progression and modulation of mTOR kinase-
targeted therapy; 2) to determine the cap-independent mechanism of PD-L1 mRNA translation upon mTOR
kinase inhibition; and 3) to define the in vivo utility of co-targeting PD-L1 and mTOR to enhance CRC therapy.
The focus of this study is the innovative concept that both Snail and PD-L1 promote CRC progression by
cooperating with mTOR to modulate therapeutic response to mTORkis through dysregulation of 4E-BP1-
mediated translation initiation processes. This research will not only define the novel mechanistic roles of both
Snail and PD-L1 in the modulation of mTOR/4E-BP1-mediated translational control of CRC progression and
resistance to mTORkis, but also facilitate rational approaches for the development of new translatable
therapeutic strategies for patients with advanced CRC."

The 9/11 World Trade Center terrorist attack was a massive disaster, resulting in long-term psychological trauma
to the responders, with 17% of responders experiencing symptoms consistent with PTSD more than two decades
later. DNA methylation, the most widely studied epigenetic mark can illuminate gene-environment interaction
and provide biological insights into the etiology and maintenance of PTSD. Although a number of epigenome-
wide association studies (EWAS) have been conducted to identify CpGs associated with PTSD, many of these
studies are underpowered. Ongoing efforts to address small sample sizes of individual cohort include
establishing the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) PTSD Epigenetics Workgroup, which is the largest
epigenetic consortium to date. Large sample EWAS in peripheral blood are feasible and have the potential to
identify accessible biomarker for PTSD, however these studies also highlight the need for more data and stronger
designs. Specifically, the limitations of PGC include large methodological heterogeneity of the participating study
cohorts. The proposed study builds on existing studies by using more powerful design that will produce novel
findings, and at the same time allow new data to be combined with PGC data to further increase power and
ensure generalizability of the results. To this end, genome-wide methylation profiling with the Illumina Infinium
MethylationEPIC BeadChip arrays will be generated using biobanked blood samples on a subset of n=1,850
responders who have been genotyped. In Aim 1, EWAS will be performed to identify CpGs associated with PTSD
and PTSD dimensions. In Aim 2, genetic variants associated with methylation will be derived via methylation
quantitative trait loci analysis and integrated with PTSD genetic risk variants to identify putatively causal CpGs
and variants for PTSD. In Aim 3, results from the proposed study will be combined with the PGC results to
maximize power to detect generalizable findings. To enhance the impact of this study, an exploratory aim is
included to identify methylation subclasses associated with PTSD and health outcomes. This will be the largest
single-cohort PTSD study and is powered to identify novel epigenetic mechanisms that maintain symptoms in
chronic PTSD. This research will help to explicate pathophysiology of this disorders on molecular level, which
may become targets for treatment development."
10827529,"There is continued interest to develop novel pharmacological treatments for attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in part because of its high prevalence in the community, and lack
of optimal response to current medications, including intolerable side effects. Central nervous
system (CNS) pharmacodynamic (PD) measures have not been well characterized in pediatric
and adolescent populations, which is important for future drug development. Brain imaging tools
are ideal CNS PD measures in children because they are non-invasive and reproducible. Our
goal is to understand the neural correlates of treating ADHD with methylphenidate, specifically
in children and adolescents. First, we propose to determine the dose-dependent changes in
cognitive task-related neural activity after acute methylphenidate using functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI, Aim 1). Then we will identify the changes in brain glutamate and
other brain metabolites after acute methylphenidate using high-field strength magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and determine if these changes in brain chemistry correlate
with changes in brain function (Aim 2). Data from this study will shed light onto the
pathophysiology of the cognitive symptoms of ADHD and the neural response to treatment with
stimulants, which will guide future development of novel treatments and could serve as CNS PD
measures in future treatment trials. Furthermore, we will determine the utility of these CNS PD
measures in children and adolescents that will lay the groundwork for developing pediatric brain
imaging measures for other drugs and other CNS disorders."

Activation of sensory nerves, in particular nociceptive C-fibers, is a feature of most respiratory
viruses. Evidence of such activation is found in the classical consequences of C-fiber activation
including sneezing, sore throat, coughing, and reflex secretions. As well as causing the troubling
symptoms of viral infection, the activation of these nerves allows viruses to escape the body and be
transmitted to other hosts, i.e. nociceptor activation amplifies viral spread in a community. In addition,
activation of airway vagal C-fibers can lead to strong reflex bronchoconstriction and excessive
secretions that likely contribute to the exacerbation of asthma particularly in children. Given the
relevance to human disease, surprisingly little is known about how virus infection induces C-fiber
activation and sensitization. In theory, viral infection leads to C-fiber activation by two general
mechanisms. The first is that viral infection of epithelial cells leads to the production of a mediator(s)
that stimulates the C-fiber terminals. The second is that the virus itself directly activates the nerves.
This second mechanism will likely be dependent on the specific virus type. This proposal focuses on
this second (direct) mechanism of activation as it relates to coronaviruses. I hypothesize that the
coronavirus spike protein interacts directly with C-fiber terminals in a manner that activates and
sensitizes the nociceptive C-fibers. My preliminary data, using three orthogonal approaches, support
the conclusion that the spike protein directly activates (evokes action potential discharge) about 40-
50% of vagal C-fibers in mouse airways. My first aim is to characterize the subtype of vagal C-fibers
that are activated by spike protein and also to assess whether the spike protein, short of overt
activation, leads to the sensitization of C-fiber terminals, i.e. renders them more sensitive to other
activating stimuli. My second aim focuses on the mechanism. I hypothesize that this interaction
involves the galactin-3 fold in the spike protein, and occurs independently of the spike protein
receptor ACE2 or toll-like receptors. Irrespective of the proximal binding target, I will address our
hypothesis that activation is secondary to the opening of TRPV1 and or TRPA1 channels. These aims
will be addressed using single cell RT-PCR analysis of mRNA expression in airway specific
nociceptive C-fibers, extracellular and patch-clamp electrophysiology, and 2-photon live imaging
techniques. The results of the studies are expected to provide insights into a novel mechanism of
coronavirus induced airway C-fiber activation."

This is an R25 program renewal proposal describing the Research Training Program for Neurology and
Neurosurgery Residents at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Brigham and Women’s Hospital
(BWH) of Harvard Medical School (HMS). The program combines a broad variety of collaborative research
opportunities available at these campuses together with a dedicated group of neuroscience mentors. Further,
our mentors are aligned in a two-tiered system that includes a ‘research’ mentor who is directly responsible for
the scientific activities of the candidate and a secondary ‘gateway’ mentor who is additionally responsible for
oversight and career development of the R25 candidate. Research mentors are selected from a vast field of
research scientists at our two institutions together with those of the Boston area. The gateway mentors are
selected on the basis of research activity, experience guiding clinicians in the early stages of successful
research careers, and commitment to this program in order to develop our residents into effective physician-
scientists. In addition, a steering committee oversees all aspects of the resident research training experience
and provide guidance to trainees on mentor selection and grant submissions. This program has already proven
to be tremendously successful in its first 14 years of funding. The R25 program has sponsored 76 trainees
(including those still in the program), many of whom have produced high-impact first author publications as well
as earned foundation and K12, K23 and K08 funding soon after completing this program. Many have also gone
on to become academic faculty at institutions across the country and have developed highly productive
research careers with consistent NIH funding support. Altogether, the programmatic structure provided in this
renewal builds on the past success of our program and aims to ensure that our Neurology and Neurosurgical
residents obtain the highest level of training possible. It also aims to ensure that we continue to foster the
development of outstanding physician-scientists through our combined Neurology and Neurosurgery programs."

This career development award will establish the candidate, Dr. Katherine Arlinghaus, as an independent
investigator with expertise in the development, implementation, and evaluation of community-based,
interventions that are strategically designed to address the interconnection between physical and mental health
to optimize the reduction of risk for cardiovascular disease development among underserved youth.
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Most pediatric prevention programs focus on
key modifiable physical health behaviors like physical activity, diet, and more recently sleep. While important
components for prevention, the physical health focus can overlook the importance of mental health and
wellbeing as a preventative factor for cardiovascular disease development. The omittance of intervention
explicitly aimed at preventing depression has been highlighted by the recent substantial increases in rates of
youth depression symptoms. To reduce the number of youth at high risk for developing CVD, we need to
create accessible and appealing prevention interventions that synergistically address youth mental and
physical health needs and have realistic pathways to large-scale dissemination. To address this critical need,
Dr. Arlinghaus designed an afterschool program that uses a mentorship model to simultaneously address
mental and physical health among youth. While well-liked, challenges regarding intervention reach
encountered during the proof-of-concept study require further revision and augmentation. Dr. Arlinghaus’s K01
project will return to the design phase of intervention optimization and work with current and new school sites
to augment and revise the intervention to increase its reach and impact. Preliminary testing of the intervention
will be conducted at the new school sites to identify needs for further revisions and harmonize research
methodologies to prepare for a future fully-powered, real-world efficacy trial. Specifically, Dr. Arlinghaus will
use informative qualitative methods to collaboratively identify intervention augmentations and revision with
stakeholders to improve intervention reach and impact (Aim 1), and will then conduct a two year quasi-
experimental crossover pilot trial to characterize the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact on physical
activity and depression outcomes among adolescents and young adult mentors (aim 2). These research aims
will provide hands-on-experience for Dr. Arlinghaus to apply didactic training in qualitative methods skills,
content area knowledge of the connection between mental health and physical activity, accelerometry skills,
and community-based intervention study design and implementation. She will be supported by a
multidisciplinary team of mentors with expertise in each of these areas. This proposal addresses NHLBI
priorities to optimize novel cardiovascular disease prevention strategies and implementation research and
identify how community-based implementation strategies can address cardiovascular disease inequities."
10772169,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Von Willebrand Disease (VWD), the most common bleeding disorder worldwide, is caused by mutations in von
Willebrand Factor (VWF), a large multidomain protein. In the blood, VWF circulates as a long multimer of head-
to-head disulfide linked dimers of mature VWF. These long multimers are critical for VWF function as they give
circulating VWF polyvalency for activating and binding platelets at sites of endothelial injury, forming a hemostatic
plug to staunch bleeding. Additionally, long VWF multimers stabilize coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in the blood.
To form these long multimers, crucial for normal hemostasis, VWF forms helical tubules in the low pH of the late-
Golgi and Weibel-Palade bodies (WPB). The helical tubule templates the disulfide bond formation needed to
form long multimers by positioning D3 domains in close proximity. At the same time, VWF’s prodomain is
cleaved, generating the mature VWF that binds FVIII in the blood. Aberrancy in these maturation steps due to
VWF mutations causes several VWD subtypes. Despite the importance of the helical tubule for VWF
multimerization, the high-resolution structure of the helical tubule is not known. This fellowship proposal aims to
determine structures of VWF helical tubules at three stages of maturation, test Type 2A VWD mutations for
causing short tubules, and interrogate the implications of prodomain cleavage for FVIII-VWF tubule association.
In Aim 1, using a C-terminally truncated VWF construct, a high-resolution structure of the VWF tubule before
and after head-to-head disulfide bonds form will be determined using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and
helical reconstruction. Using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging, a three-
dimensional reconstruction of the in situ VWF tubule will be determined to test if the close packing of VWF helical
tubules inside the native WPB environment has consequences for the molecular structure of VWF in the tubule.
Guided by this structural insight, a subset of VWD mutations will be tested for their effect on robust tubule
formation and normal VWF multimer length. Aim 2 will determine the structural rearrangements in VWF upon
prodomain cleavage and test if the cleaved tubule can bind FVIII. This research will elucidate the molecular
mechanism of VWF head-to-head disulfide bond formation, necessary for VWF multimerization and normal
hemostasis. Structural characterization of the VWF tubule will lead to a molecular understanding of VWD caused
by inefficient multimerization. Identification of FVIII-VWF tubule binding will provide a novel context to understand
their association and inform therapeutic efforts to modulate FVIII-VWF binding before secretion into the blood. A
preliminary VWF tubule reconstruction indicates that additional data collection will allow atomic model building.
This research will be carried out under the sponsorship of Dr. Timothy Springer, experienced in structural
characterization of VWF, and Dr. Alan Brown, an expert in cryo-EM, creating a strong training environment for
predoctoral physician-scientist training."
10772177,"The Behavioral Health of Venezuelan Families in Diaspora:
A Cross-National Study of Migration-Related Stress and Resilience
Project Summary
The United Nations estimates that nearly 5 million Venezuelans have fled their home country since 2015. At
present, Venezuelans are among the fastest-growing immigrant groups in the United States (US), filing two times
the number of US asylum applications annually as citizens from any other country. Remarkably, almost no
systematic research—excluding our formative work—has examined the wellbeing of Venezuelan families in
diaspora. Findings from our cross-sectional formative research with convenience samples of Venezuelan youth
and parents suggest that depression and alcohol misuse are critical challenges for this population, and that many
Venezuelan crisis migrants are exposed to high levels of stress both before and after migrating. To address this
critical research gap, we aim to conduct the definitive study of the Venezuelan diaspora in the US with a
comparison sample in Colombia—a study that will provide knowledge vital to addressing the immediate and
longer-term needs of Venezuelan crisis migrant families, and inform responses to future crises. The comparison
with Venezuelans in Colombia is essential for identifying aspects of life in the US that may uniquely contribute
to risk among crisis migrants, and for informing context-specific and cross-national solutions to a hemispheric
crisis. Grounded in cultural stress theory, we examine how pre-migration factors and post-migration cultural
stress influence family functioning and, in turn, parent and youth behavioral health outcomes (i.e., depression,
alcohol misuse). We also examine how key protective factors (e.g., ethnic pride, familismo), buffer the effects of
hypothesized stressors. This research project is oriented around three specific aims:
[1] Identify pre- and post-migration risk and protective factors related to depression and alcohol misuse among
Venezuelan crisis migrant youth and their parents, recruiting dyads in the US (n = 500) and Colombia (n = 250).
[2]: Determine the mechanisms by which pre-migration factors (e.g., chronic hunger, psychosocial stress) and
post-migration cultural stress impact depression and alcohol misuse among Venezuelan crisis migrants. We
hypothesize that pre-migration adversity will amplify the impact of post-migration cultural stress on family
functioning and, in turn, increase risk of depression and alcohol misuse among Venezuelan youth and parents.
[3] Disseminate findings to accelerate efforts to support Venezuelan crisis migrant families, via bilingual reports
and in-person and online workshops to help clinical and health providers to improve practice.
Our team is at the forefront of Latin American crisis migrant research. Since 2017, we have interviewed 1000+
Venezuelan crisis migrants, and currently lead a study with Puerto Rican families displaced by Hurricane Maria.
We have designed a study that will provide critical insight to address the needs of Venezuelan crisis migrant
families immediately. Moreover, it will yield practice-relevant knowledge generalizable beyond this specific
population as crisis migration is a recurring phenomenon. Our study can serve as an important case example as
scientists, practitioners, and policymakers seek to understand and respond to the needs of crisis migrants."

10771977,"Project Summary
 To proliferate, cells must synthesize sufficient biomass, including nucleotides, proteins, and lipids. This
is particularly important for rapidly proliferating cancer cells, which reprogram metabolism to meet the increased
biosynthetic demands of proliferation. However, biosynthetic demands differ across cancer types and
physiological environments. How cancer cells alter metabolism in response to specific biosynthetic demands is
not well characterized, and better understanding these alterations will reveal metabolic liabilities that can be
targeted to inhibit tumor growth.
 To synthesize biomass, cells require electron acceptors to oxidize nutrients like glucose and glutamine
into biomass precursors, such as amino acids for protein synthesis and citrate for fatty acid synthesis. One
essential electron acceptor is the redox cofactor NAD+. The ratio of oxidized NAD+ to reduced NADH
(NAD+/NADH) influences the cellular redox state and reflects NAD+ availability for oxidative biosynthetic
reactions. Thus, a sufficiently oxidized NAD+/NADH ratio must be maintained to enable synthesis of oxidized
biomass and can limit cancer cell proliferation. We have found that increased demands for the amino acid serine
and the lipid precursor citrate elevate the NAD+ demand, yet cancer cells surprisingly maintain a similar
NAD+/NADH ratio, indicating that cells preserve NAD+/NADH homeostasis despite increased demands for
oxidized biomass synthesis. The goal of the proposed research is to determine how cancer cells maintain
NAD+/NADH homeostasis to support increased oxidative biosynthetic demands and tumor growth. I hypothesize
that cancer cells maintain the NAD+/NADH ratio by modulating NAD+ regeneration, consumption, and synthesis
to support biomass production. To test this hypothesis, I will use both cancer cell lines and mouse models to
investigate how cancer cells and tumors maintain NAD+/NADH homeostasis in lipid-depleted conditions, a
nutrient environment that increases cellular NAD+ demand for citrate production and is a physiological condition
faced by cancer cells in the body. In Aim 1, I will investigate whether cancer cells increase three mechanisms of
NAD+ regeneration to maintain redox homeostasis for lipid synthesis and tumor growth: fermentation,
mitochondrial respiration, and uncoupling mitochondrial respiration from ATP synthesis. In Aim 2, I will
investigate whether decreased flux through select NAD+ consuming redox reactions increases NAD+ availability
for lipid synthesis. In Aim 3, I will investigate if NAD+ salvage synthesis from nicotinamide helps maintain a
sufficiently oxidized NAD+/NADH ratio for increased lipid synthesis and tumor growth. The results of this study
will lead to a better understanding of how cancer cells adapt to different nutrient and tissue environments and
provide insight into a fundamental process in which cancer cells must engage to maintain redox homeostasis for
proliferation. This will improve therapeutic approaches that target cancer metabolism and lead to the
development of more effective and selective cancer treatments."

 The overarching goal of our proposed IMSD at UC Davis Training Program is to increase diversity of
the biomedical research workforce via increasing the number of diverse students that complete PhDs in
biomedical-related science fields. For this, we propose to implement a comprehensive intervention program that
has rigorous research & education activities specifically for first-year graduate students. We anticipate
that our enrichment activities will increase diversity of the life science pipeline by facilitating successful
advancement of UC Davis PhD students to the next step of their biomedical research career. We propose to
select 10 graduate students per year to participate in this program, which has four major objectives. The first is
to increase the number of diverse students awarded PhDs in life science disciplines. In alignment with this goal,
we expect that (a) the rate of acceptance of underrepresented (UR), economically disadvantaged, and disabled
students into the target graduate groups will not be less than the rate for students not in those categories; (b)
the trainees’ oral and written communication skills will be enhanced; (c) the trainees’ selection for 2nd and 3rd
year slots on other UC Davis T32 programs will be increased, further expanding their interdisciplinary vistas; (d)
time to and success rate of IMSD Fellows in advancing to candidacy will be enhanced; and (e) at least 80% of
the Fellows will complete their PhD. Our second major objective of the proposed IMSD Fellows program is
enhancement of the mentor trainee relationship. This will be accomplished by (a) implementing an annual
workshop on mentor-trainee relationships which will include advice from successful senior graduate students;
(b) implementing/utilizing an annual IDP to improve productivity and clarity; and (c) having mentors take
specialized mentor training workshops. Our third objective is to develop outreach/communication and career
skills of the IMSD trainees via (a) implementing structured interaction with undergraduate UR, economically
disadvantaged and/or disabled students, providing relevant role models for these undergraduates; b) mentoring
of entering IMSD trainees by more senior R25 IMSD and IMSD T32 graduate students; and c) development of
important career skills by implementing experiential learning opportunities. The fourth objective is to utilize
program evaluations to continuously improve the program and provide expedient dissemination of the results.
This will be done by (a) implementation of evaluations throughout the Training Program; (b) publishing our
success and failures to enhance the effectiveness of other T32 programs;(c) annually revisit the program plan
incorporating improvements suggested by program evaluations; and (d) creation of an outstanding IMSD website
for diverse graduate students."
10772003,"Project Summary
There are currently just under one million people with HIV in South Africa who have initiated antiretroviral
therapy (ART) but remain unsuppressed. South Africa has been making progress towards UNAIDS 90-90-90
targets but has only reached 47% of those infected being virally suppressed. Therefore, if effective approaches
can be found to keep patients on treatment, adhering, and virally suppressed, the impact could be significant.
In South Africa, one major barrier to consistent treatment is intimate partner violence (IPV) as nearly 50% of
women have experienced IPV. Addressing IPV could have effects in supporting patients on HIV treatment to
continue to adhere. The Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) is an evidence-based intervention
comprised of cognitive-behavioral therapy elements. It is transdiagnostic in that it can flexibly address a range
of problems and represents the current movement in global mental health as a more cost effective, scalable
and sustainable model. CETA is one of the most promising interventions to impact HIV outcomes through
addressing violence
 To evaluate CETA, we propose a randomized controlled trial of HIV-infected women, with or without
their partners, who have experienced IPV and have an unsuppressed viral load to test the effect of CETA on
increasing viral suppression and reducing violence. The study has three aims: Aim 1: Among HIV-infected
women on ART who have experienced IPV and have an unsuppressed viral load, to assess the effectiveness
of CETA vs. active control at increasing the proportion retained and virally suppressed by 12 months and at
decreasing the severity of IPV and other mental and behavioral health problems using an individually
randomized trial. Aim 2: To identify mediators and moderators of CETA’s effect on the primary outcome
(retention and viral suppression). Aim 3: To assess the cost and cost-effectiveness of CETA vs. active control
at increasing the proportion of women who have experienced IPV who are retained and virally suppressed by
12 months.
 The study question is significant given the prevalence of IPV in female patients with unsuppressed
viral loads in South Africa and the potential for improving viral suppression by addressing IPV and its sequelae.
If effective, this approach could have a significant global impact on outcomes for virally unsuppressed
women and reduce transmission to uninfected partners. It is innovative in utilizing an evidence-based
approach (CETA) shown to affect IPV as well as many other problems that contribute to poor HIV treatment
outcomes."
10772005,"Heart failure (HF) represents a final common pathway for both ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, with an annual incidence >600,000 new cases each year, a disease prevalence >6 million patients, and an estimated annual cost >$30 billion in the USA alone. Improved understanding of HF pathophysiology throughout recent decades has led to critical advances in HF prognosis through neurohormonal blockade. Despite these improvements, the HF mortality rate remains extraordinarily high (>30% within 5 years of diagnosis) and HF remains the leading cause for hospitalization in patients >65 years (a growing segment of the US population). The HF epidemiologic data suggest that the current treatment paradigm fails to interrupt one or more key pathophysiologic mechanisms of HF, and confirm the urgent need to develop novel therapeutic approaches to alleviate symptoms of HF, improve quality of life, and reduce re-hospitalization for HF. The evidence supporting the presence of inflammation in HF is overwhelming. One of the unanswered questions is whether inflammation plays a key role in the progression of HF or is merely a marker of disease. Recent data from our group and others have shown that the systemic inflammatory response in patients with HF can be inhibited with the use of a targeted Interleukin-1 (IL-1) blockers, anakinra or canakinumab. Both in preclinical and clinical studies, in parallel with reducing systemic inflammation, IL-1 blockers preserved or restored cardiac function, whether the effects on systemic inflammation and on cardiac function are intertwined and cannot be dissociated, or whether they are independent has not been explored. IL-1 is a master regulator of the inflammatory response, namely NF-kB activation, that is shared with many other cytokines and is part of the redundancy of the system. An unconventional signaling of the IL-1 receptor signaling through the phosphoinositide-3 kinase γ (PI3Kγ) has been characterized in inflammation and cancer. Whether IL-1 signaling in HF is mediated through PI3Kγ remains unknown. We hypothesize that enhanced levels of IL-1 increase PI3K p110γ expression in cardiomyocytes, that in turn results in selective induction of p87 co- signaling, and cardiac dysfunction through a scaffolding function on PDE3B. To test this hypothesis, we will determine whether IL-1 induces p110γ and p87 in cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo (Aim #1); whether PI3Kγ mediates IL-1 induced systolic dysfunction in vivo (Aim #2); and whether we can distinguish the kinase- dependent from the scaffolding function of PI3Kγ in cardiac dysfunction (Aim #3). Determining the mechanisms by which inflammation, and IL-1 in specific, contributes to cardiac dysfunction may open the way to more and better ways to prevent and treat heart failure – which is an urgent unmet need."
10772152,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The signaling pathways involving phosphoinositide-3-kinases (PI3Ks) are highly conserved and tightly regulated
to influence the activation, proliferation, and survival of all cell types. PI3K signaling plays a major role in T cell
responses to antigen due to its position directly downstream of T cell receptor (TCR)/CD28 ligation. Our lab has
recently shown that the cell surface protein TrIP (Transmembrane Inhibitor of PI3K, gene name: Pik3ip1) has a
distinctly high expression on T cells and is capable of downregulating PI3K signaling in CD4+ T cells, acting as
a negative regulator of T cell immune responses. These studies revealed that CD4+ T cells lacking TrIP
expression exhibit a more Th1 inflammatory phenotype compared to WT controls both in vivo and in vitro. These
data have led us to propose that TrIP restricts the inflammatory activity of CD8+ T cells, and that
targeting/knockout of this negative regulator may promote anti-tumor immunity. I have already obtained
preliminary data demonstrating that CD8+ T cell-specific TrIP knockout mice (TrIPfl/flE8icre) are resistant to growth
of syngeneic tumors. In addition to increased tumor resistance, we have also found that tumors harvested from
our TrIPfl/flE8icre knockout mice contain twice as many infiltrating T cells compared to their WT counterparts. We
also found that CD8+ T cells were the main drivers of this increased T cell infiltration, as their frequency was
double that of the CD4+ population. These preliminary data are the basis of our proposal aimed at further
elucidating cell-intrinsic effects of TrIP activity in CD8+ T cells, including its impact on antitumor immunity. These
studies will not only improve our understanding of TrIP as a negative immune regulator, but also inform on the
potential for TrIP as a future immunotherapeutic target."
10770274,"Project Summary/Abstract
Tumor progression – including resistance to therapy, metastasis, and recurrence – is responsible for the
majority of cancer deaths. Understanding how cancer cells survive treatment, spread to distant sites, persist
as dormant residual cells, and eventually recur is essential to improving the treatment of this disease. The
long-term goal of my research group is to identify the pathways that regulate these processes in order to
prevent or treat tumor recurrence.
To achieve, this we are using conditional genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of breast cancer that
allow for the mechanistic dissection of the processes of dormancy and recurrence. Using these models, we
have identified a functional role for the tumor suppressor Par-4 in regulating survival and recurrence of breast
cancer cells after therapy. Par-4 is downregulated in recurrent tumors from three GEM models, and this
downregulation is both necessary and sufficient for tumor recurrence. Similarly, in women with breast cancer,
low Par-4 expression is associated with a poor response to neoadjuvant therapy and an increased risk of
recurrence. We have characterized the upstream pathways that regulate Par-4 expression and function during
dormancy and recurrence, as well as the downstream pathways that Par-4 regulates to inhibit dormant cell
survival and recurrence.
This proposal will build on this work to further explore the mechanism by which Par-4 acts as a tumor
suppressor. The overarching hypothesis of the proposal is that Par-4 promotes cell death in part through
inducing actomyosin contractility, and this contributes to its tumor suppressive functions. We will explore this
hypothesis in the context of Par-4’s role in residual cell survival and the survival of invasive lobular cancer
cells. Our work will reveal new information on how Par-4 functions to regulate dormant residual cell survival
and may uncover novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention in eliminating residual cells and preventing

linear motors are absent, a widespread family of ParA/MinD (A/D) ATPases are responsible for spatially
organizing an array of genetic- and protein-based cellular cargos, the majority of which are unstudied. Of the
well-studied examples, ParA ATPases segregate chromosomes and MinD ATPases position cell division in
bacteria. Less studied is the growing list of A/D ATPases that spatially organize diverse protein-based cellular
cargos, such as bacterial microcompartments (BMCs), flagella, chemotaxis arrays, and conjugation machinery.
The long term goal is to understand how A/D ATPases drive and coordinate the positioning of such a diverse
set of fundamental cellular cargos across bacteria, including those important to human health.
 Preliminary data from the project team shows that over a third of all bacteria encode multiple A/D ATPases.
Among these bacteria are several human pathogens. The project team identified a nonpathogenic and
experimentally tractable bacterium, Halothiobacillus neapolitanus, encoding six A/D ATPases, where each
ATPase is dedicated to the positioning of a specific cellular cargo: the chromosome, the divisome, the
carboxysome BMC, the flagellum, the chemotaxis array, and the conjugation machinery. The goal for the next
five years is to use H. neapolitanus as an ideal model for probing mechanistic commonality, variation, and
coordination, among the most widespread ATPase family used in the subcellular organization of bacterial cells.
 These advancements are important for human health because several of the bacteria encoding multiple
A/D ATPases have associated cargos involved in pathogenesis. The overall objective here is to determine how
multiple A/D ATPases coordinately function to spatially organize diverse cellular cargos. The central
hypothesis is that in bacteria encoding multiple A/D ATPases, each ATPase is dedicated to the positioning of a
specific cellular cargo, with specificity provided by an adaptor protein that links the cargo to its cognate
ATPase, and that these positioning reactions are spatiotemporally coordinated. The rationale for the proposed
research is that by determining how multiple A/D ATPases coordinately function within a single bacterial
organism the project team will define the general mode of transport among this ATPase family, determine how
the mechanism is altered for disparate cargos, and identify the specificity determinants for each cargo. The
proposed research is creative and original because it has only recently been appreciated that protein-based
organelles are prevalent across the bacterial world, making organelle trafficking in bacteria a new field of study.
 The project team will leverage this knowledge in the design of minimal and modular positioning systems for
the faithful inheritance of cellular cargos in heterologous bacteria for synthetic biology approaches and
biomedical application. Finally, the project team anticipates these findings will inform identification of novel
positioning mechanisms and antibiotic targets important for bacterial pathogens."
10765129,"Project Summary: This renewal application aims to support the PI in developing an intelligent ultrafast
bioimaging program that could open a new area of investigation and lead to a series of fundamental scientific
discoveries. Space and time, two critical physical dimensions, constitute the basis of modern metrology. In bio-
imaging, as recognized by the 2014 Nobel Prize in chemistry, there have been breathtaking advances in
improving spatial resolution, resulting in an impressive arsenal of nanoscopic tools that can break the diffraction
limit of light. Despite the importance, pursuing a high temporal resolution has only recently gained attention. The
motivation to develop methods for ultrafast imaging originates from the landscape shift of contemporary biology
from morphological explorations and phenotypic probing of organisms to seeking quantitative insights into
underlying mechanisms at molecular levels. The transient molecular events occur at a timescale varying from a
few nanoseconds that molecules glow in their ""fluorescence lifetime"" to tens of femtoseconds that molecules
take to vibrate. Therefore, ultrafast imaging is essential for observing and characterizing such dynamic events.
 With support from an ESI MIRA grant, we have established a highly productive research program and
developed several ultrafast imaging tools that showed great potential for biological studies. However, several
key challenges are still yet to be addressed, such as low light-detection sensitivity at high speed. To solve these
problems and further expand the realm of our program, I propose to bring in artificial intelligence and explore a
new research direction, intelligent ultrafast bioimaging. Our core idea is to treat an optical imaging system as an
encoder-decoder pair, where the imaging system optically encodes a scene on the sensor by physical
measurements; an electronic decoder then estimates the object's properties from the raw sensor data. Rather
than directly measuring the properties of a biological system, we will acquire encoded measurements through a
computational imaging scheme. We will also develop physics-informed machine-learning methods to seamlessly
integrate data with physics models in biological systems and codesign the machine-learning algorithms with
ultrafast imaging hardware in a holistic manner as an end-to-end optimization problem. We expect that such
synergy will lead to a new generation of ultrafast imagers and ultimately reshape many fields in biomedical
research."
10765184,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 General anesthetics are essential in medicine, providing unconsciousness, amnesia and analgesia for
otherwise intolerable surgical procedures. Although general anesthetics are widely used, little is known about
how the brain recovers consciousness after general anesthesia. Consequently, there are no available
treatments for common clinical problems associated with recovery from general anesthesia, such as
emergence delirium and delayed emergence. Recent studies demonstrate that subcortical arousal nuclei are
important for recovery of arousal, but mechanisms underlying recovery of cognition have not been explored.
 There are important knowledge gaps that this research program intends to fill over the next five years.
First, the trajectory of cognitive recovery during anesthetic emergence is unknown. Specifically, it is unclear
how discrete cognitive domains recover, and how the recovery trajectory differs among commonly used
anesthetic drugs with different mechanisms of action. Second, it is unknown whether there are sex differences
in cognitive recovery from general anesthesia, and whether different stages of the estrous cycle alter the
cognitive recovery profile in female rodents. Finally, it its unknown if activating neural circuits involved in
arousal, attention, and memory facilitate cognitive recovery from general anesthesia.
 The broad, long-term objectives of this R35 (MIRA) grant are to elucidate how cognition
recovers after general anesthesia, and to develop novel approaches to accelerate recovery. First, we
will use touchscreen-based cognitive testing of rats to establish how specific cognitive domains recover after
general anesthesia. Second, we will determine whether the female estrous cycle influences cognitive recovery.
Finally, we will use chemogenetic manipulations to activate neural circuits involved in arousal, attention, and
memory to test for acceleration of cognitive recovery. These studies will inform and guide novel approaches to
accelerate recovery of consciousness after general anesthesia and treat common clinical problems associated
with anesthetic emergence. They will also provide new insights into fundamental mechanisms of
consciousness and cognition."
10765185,"Project Abstract
 Halogenated organic compounds are used extensively as building blocks, synthetic intermediates, and end
use products for pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications. The utility of these compounds, including their
biological activity, arises from the reactivity and physical properties uniquely conferred to them by halogen
substitution. The importance of halogenation and limitations associated with current halogenation methods
prompted us to develop enzymes for biocatalytic halogenation. This proposal outlines the evolution of flavin
dependent halogenases (FDHs) and Fe(II)/α-ketoglutarate dependent halogenases (FeDHs) for a range
selective halogenation and related (i.e. pseudohalogen) atom transfer reactions. Specifically, we will build on
our extensive experience with FDH engineering to expand the range of substrates and sites on those
substrates that can be halogenated. We will focus on enabling halogenation of electron deficient aromatic
substrates with high site- and enantioselectivity. These efforts will benefit from recently characterized single
component flavin reductase/FDH enzymes, and we will optimize conditions for large scale halogenation using
these simplified biocatalysts. Finally, we recently reported that FDHs catalyze enantioselective halocyclization,
and we will expand the substrate scope of these reactions to include systems that cannot be achieved using
small molecule catalysts. In the FeDH space, we will engineer enzymes with expanded substrate scope to
enable site-selective C-H azidation of natural products and pharmaceuticals. This capability will be used for
chemoenzymatic synthesis via fragment coupling reactions and other processes that leverage the unique
reactivity of azides for more extensive remodeling of substrates to generate natural product-like heterocycles.
Finally, we will use both computational design and directed evolution to enable site-selective fluorination using
FeDHs. In addition to addressing a major synthetic challenge, this effort will improve our understanding of non-
native rebound in FeDHs to improve these enzymes for different C-H functionalization processes."
10765269,"Mechanisms of Cell-type-specific pre-mRNA Splicing
Abstract:
The overarching goal of this project is to uncover cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms of pre-mRNA splicing at
the cell-type level. While single-cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) is revolutionizing our understanding of cell-
type heterogeneity in animal tissues, the extent and mechanism of cell-type-specific splicing remain largely
uncharted. The major challenges are threefold: 1) Current scRNA-Seq platforms are predominantly built on read
counts of the 3’ or 5’ end fragments of polyadenylated RNAs and do not have sufficient coverage for splice
junctions; 2) Homologous RNA binding proteins (RBPs) frequently have overlapping expression patterns and
redundant functions, making it challenging to uncover their full functions in vivo; and 3) Protein-RNA interaction
has been predominantly studied in cell lines or bulk tissues using UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation-
based approaches, and it remains a challenge to identify RBP targets in specific cell types from intact tissues.
My group uses the mouse brain as a model system and has been developing new tools to overcome these
challenges. We have made proof-of-concept progress and seek to 1) uncover cis-regulatory elements and
coordinated splicing patterns by single-cell long-read sequencing; 2) study redundant RBP functions by
multiplexed genome editing; and 3) investigate protein-RNA interaction at the cell-type level by dual RNA-
deaminase editing and sequencing. Successful completion of this project will generate new tools and datasets
to understand the mechanisms of cell-type-specific pre-mRNA processing. The MIRA funding mechanism will
permit the flexibility to integrate technological advances and study new biological questions."

Morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV/AIDS remains unacceptably high in sub-Saharan Africa,
largely due to the parallel challenges of poverty and food insecurity. Yet, health professionals are not trained to
include sustainable development solutions as part of their armamentarium to address poor HIV health
outcomes. The Sustainable Development for HIV Health (SD4H) Training Program provides intensive graduate
training for Kenyan PhD and MSc candidates with a focus on improving HIV health outcomes through
innovative food security and poverty alleviation interventions. We aspire to create a cadre of graduate trainees
who will become the next generation of HIV researchers with transdisciplinary expertise in public health, HIV
health, and development sciences in order to help address the vicious cycle of poverty, food insecurity and
poor HIV health The SD4H is a consortium among Kenyan and United States (US) institutions including
Maseno University (MU), the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), and the University of California
Global Health Institute (UCGHI).
Strengths and innovations of our program include: 1) A unified consortium that offers synergy by
capitalizing upon MU, KEMRI and UCGHI's ability to provide exceptional training and research support; 2) A
team with extensive experience in training and building local capacity including the 25 years of highly-
successful research and training collaboration between KEMRI and UCSF investigators; 3) Exceptional
transdisciplinary team of faculty mentors with expertise in diverse disciplines not typically found in a single
training program including: public health, medicine, HIV/AIDS, nursing, economics, agriculture and food
security, nutrition, environmental sciences, gender studies, development and strategic studies, and biological
and social sciences; 4) A proven mentor training program designed to strengthen mentoring capacity at LMIC
institutions; and 5) A team mentoring approach, with a primary mentor (usually from Maseno University) to act
as the trainee's supervisor, that enhances and supports transdisciplinary research mentorship to advance
careers and scientific discovery. During the five-year program, we will train 4 PhD and 9 Master's students, as
well as additional MU students who participate in the annual SD4H workshops and on-line courses, and faculty
who attend the mentoring development workshop. PhD and Master's students will receive most of their
education at MU, with doctoral students spending a year at UCSF to complete the year-long Advanced
Training in Clinical Research certificate, and Masters students taking part in online courses at UCSF and
UCGHI. In addition, doctoral students will have the options to spend a quarter at UC Davis or take additional
SD4H courses at UCSF. All students will participate in mentored research. Upon completion of the SD4H
program, Kenyan scientists will successfully engage in producing evidence-based SD4H research to improve
health among HIV-infected and affected populations, will be trained and supported to mentor the next
generation of junior scientists in this field, and will play a critical role in policy and community health practices
locally, regionally and internationally."

This new R25 program is designed to engage undergraduate students in multi-disciplinary translational
cardiovascular research directed toward the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease
(CVD). There are too few under-represented racial/ethnic minorities, individuals with disabilities, and people
from rural and inner-city locations who are pursuing careers in CVD research (all recognized by the NHLBI
task force review of research training and career development programs). This program is designed to
involve students from these backgrounds in multi-disciplinary research activities to reduce the burden of
CVD. Our 5-year proposal will enroll 12 sophomore students each year into a multi-year commitment that
combines the summer research stipend from this proposed NIH award with an educational curriculum
supported by each student’s undergraduate institution of higher learning in Virginia (including historically
minority-serving universities), and the research strengths of Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) –
including an NIH Clinical and Translational Science Award and the VCU Pauley Heart Center. Key features
of this proposed R25 program include: 1) pairing each trainee with a funded research mentor whose
research focuses on CVD; 2) outstanding multidisciplinary faculty who are seasoned mentors; 3) access to
multiple phenotypic and biologic materials from major NIH-funded basic science, prospective cohort, or
clinical trials at VCU through the supporting program faculty; 4) courses provided by the existing
undergraduate, graduate, and medical school faculty to supplement areas of CVD research not previously
experienced by students; and 5) two institutional seminar series that enhance interactions with other
students and individuals from multiple disciplines. A group of racially and gender diverse faculty from six (6)
universities who will be a part of the proposed program already have experience mentoring 12 students in a
successful and comparable program in the prior year. All faculty have NIH or VA extramural or other peer-
reviewed funding; strong institutional support (financial resources, facilities, and equipment); robust
integration with the VCU Center of Health Disparities for recruiting and training minority individuals; and
support for key professional development activities such as presentations and grant and manuscript writing.
The ultimate goal of this R25 program is to attract and train a cohort of outstanding young students from six
(6) undergraduate institutions within Virginia to become fluent in the latest developments of CVD
multidisciplinary translational research, who will be well prepared to pursue future careers in cardiovascular
health. Accomplishing this goal would augment the number of under-represented racial/ethnic
minorities, those with disabilities and persons from rural and inner-city communities into graduate
programs focused on developing new advances in multi-disciplinary translational research to treat
and prevent cardiovascular disease, a major public health issue."
10757639,"Despite an array of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to address HIV – and the 90/90/90 strategy – the HIV
epidemic in Malaysia remains volatile. With over 100,000 cumulative HIV cases, Malaysia's rapidly expanding
HIV epidemic is the fifth largest in the Asia-Pacific region and concentrated within the most-at-risk populations,
including people who inject drugs (PWID), men who have sex with men (MSM), and female sex workers (FSW).
This is attributed to an inadequate scale up of EBIs, including access to HIV testing, pre-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP), antiretroviral therapy, needle/syringe exchange programs (NSEPs) – to meet HIV prevention and
treatment efforts. Therefore, given the need to expand EBIs into the continuum of HIV care in Malaysia, it is
critical that we invest in implementation science and the next generation of researchers to curtail the burden of
HIV disease. Thus, we propose to develop and institutionalize the Malaysian Implementation Science Training
(MIST) at the University of Malaya (UM) – the first training on HIV and implementation science that
incorporates human rights training in Malaysia – in collaboration with Yale University. MIST will leverage the
combined resources of Yale University (Schools of Medicine and Public Health) with the UM, a leading research
and training university in the Asia/Pacific region. The MIST training program will use experts in implementation
science from Yale University and introduce a hybrid training program between Yale and UM to initially train UM
faculty in implementation and train the next generation of researchers and implementers to have the skills to
address the HIV prevention and treatment cascade of care. Specifically, MIST adheres to three core aims,
including: 1) train 10 Implementation Research Scholars (IRS) and 4 Implementation Research Faculty (IRF) by
integrating an advance training in HIV implementation science from Yale School of Medicine; 2) transfer
knowledge and build capacity for the UM Certification in HIV Implementation Science; and 3) develop the
Implementation Science Resource Hub to consolidate resources and build partnership for better population
outcomes. We will create a regional hub for implementation science by providing advanced training for faculty
(who are not yet expert in implementation science), doctoral level training and capacity development of students
at a renowned public health university that is at the forefront of dynamic sociocultural, religious and political
shifts. Building on over 13 years of successful collaborations and partnerships in medical and public health
research for key populations, with or at risk for HIV, we are poised to focus implementation science to overcome
health disparities for PWID, MSM, FSW, transgender populations and prisoners, and provide advanced training
to produce a phased transfer of knowledge, skills and expertise from Yale to UM over the course of five years,
resulting in a model curriculum for training in Malaysia at the top university in Malaysia is led and sustained by
regional and local faculty with strong community, government and international partnerships."
10757649,"ABSTRACT
Pregnancy-induced vascular adaptations, adequate placental vascularization, and optimal flux of nutrients
across the placenta to the fetus are critical to support fetal growth. Disruption in one or more of these
processes leads to fetal growth restriction (FGR). FGR affects up to 15% of all newborns, and no treatment is
available. The cause of FGR is not known, but the environmental exposure to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl
substances (PFAS) and its bioaccumulation in the placenta may hold important keys to understanding the
origins of the disease and the underlying causes of maternal organ dysfunction. Perfluorooctane sulfonate
(PFOS), a legacy PFAS, is the most produced and well studied PFAS. Elevated maternal PFOS is shown to be
associated with maternal vascular dysfunction and FGR in humans. Whether this increase in PFOS is directly
involved in endothelial dysfunction and manifestations of FGR is unknown. Our pilot studies show that elevated
PFOS in pregnant rats increases maternal blood pressure, blunts endothelial function, and decreases in
placental size, VEGF expression, and nutrient transport. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that
elevated PFOS levels impair maternal cardiovascular function and reduce placental vascularization and flux of
nutrients to lead to FGR. We will examine this premise in 3 aims employing in vivo animal studies, ex vivo
tissue-level functional analysis and in vitro molecular analyses. Aim 1 will first establish the functional effects of
elevated PFOS on systemic blood pressure and uterine artery blood flow and define the PFOS-mediated
signaling. To test the PFOS-mediated vascular mechanisms, EDHF, NO, and PGI2 relaxation pathways will be
determined. Also, the expression of eNOS and its activity state—signaling components of EDHF and PGI2
pathways as well as nitrate/nitrite and PGI2 production and changes in membrane potential—will be measured.
Then translational studies will test whether PFOS affects the endothelial pathways and mechanisms in
pregnant women by examining the effects in isolated omental and placental vessels. Aim 2 will examine
placental vascular effects. We will determine if elevated PFOS decreases growth, diameter, and length of
spiral arteries, central arterial canals, fetoplacental arterial branches, and umbilical arteries. We will also
measure the expression of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors in the placenta, and then determine if PFOS
disrupts signaling mechanisms in endothelial cells isolated from pregnant women. Aim 3 will examine placental
nutrient transport effects. We will determine if elevated PFOS decreases glucose, amino acid, and fatty acid
transport across the placenta to the fetus and measure the expression of nutrient transporters in the placenta.
Then, determine if PFOS disrupts nutrient transport in pregnant women by examining the effects in primary
trophoblasts. These results are expected to have an important impact because they will contribute
substantively to a mechanism-based understanding of PFOS's role in pregnancy complications and alert
environmental agencies to devise policies to curtail PFOS exposure to reproductive-age women."

Cellular oxidative stress is a risk factor for several human disease including diabetes,
cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cancer. Natural and food products have a great potential to
protect cells under oxidative stress conditions. Tef (Eragrostis tef) is gluten-free grain that is rich
in mineral nutrients, essential amino acids, and water-soluble vitamins and several bioactive
phytochemicals including polyphenols, flavonoids and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Tef
has been recognized by the U.S. National Research Council as a crop with excellent nutritional
potential and suitability to boost food security. However, the bioactivity of tef phytochemicals have
never been studied using physiologically relevant models. In this study, we propose to identify
bioactive compounds in tef grains and test their ability to combat oxidative stress, thus preventing
the pathogenic conditions associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced damages. This
initiative is based on our recent finding indicating that: 1) tef seed extracts increase glutathione
(GSH) levels in THP-1 monocytes, 2) an increase in GSH level is more prominent in brown than
ivory tef seeds, suggesting the existence of genotypic variability in the content of bioactive
compound, 3) Tef seed extracts increase the expression of the master regulator of antioxidant
pathway nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its targets including Heme
Oxygenase 1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase1 (NQO1), glutathione reductase (GR)
and the γ-glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC) and regulatory (GCLM) subunit, which play
a key role in GSH biosynthesis, 4) A bioactive fraction of tef extract contains a derivative of linoleic
acid (LA) 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (9-HODE), which is a marker for membrane lipid
peroxidation. These findings prompted us to hypothesize that tef has bioactive compounds which
have the potential to boost the antioxidant pathway under oxidative stress conditions likely via
Nrf2 signaling. Our aims are: 1) Identification and functional characterization of bioactive
phytochemicals from tef seeds, 2) Studying whether tef bioactive compounds induce oxidative
stress-responsive genes, and protect cells from ROS, 3) Understanding the genetic mechanism
regulating antioxidant properties of tef. This study will help in developing alternative medicines for
oxidative stress-induced diseases. It will also generate new information that can be used to
improve tef or transferred to major cereals to add value to these crops. This funding will boost the
capacity of the Osena laboratory to explore underutilized crops such as millets for desirable traits
including health benefits. The Osena laboratory and the environment at UNC Greensboro are
ideal for this research, and training students from underrepresented minority group."
10757656,"Abstract: SOLUTE CARRIER (SLC) PROTEINS IN EFFEROCYTOSIS AND INFLAMMATION:
It is truly remarkable that our bodies turn over on average about one million cells every second of life. The cells that
are turned over, predominantly by the process of apoptosis, include excess cells generated as part of normal
development, used/aged cells, and damaged cells arising from disease or infections. The efficient removal of such
apoptotic cells is important for ‘making space’ for replacement by living cells, preventing inflammation, maintaining
the function of the tissue/organ, and in turn, a healthy organism. The efficient removal of the dying cells occurs via the
process of ‘efferocytosis’, and is done by professional phagocytes (such as macrophages and immature dendritic
cells) or neighboring cells (e.g. fibroblasts, epithelial cells) within a given tissue. Efferocytosis, which involves ligands
on apoptotic cells and specific receptors on phagocytes, is very efficient, and actively anti-inflammatory. However,
impaired clearance of apoptotic cells results in the accumulation of dead cells, and the resulting chronic inflammation
linked to a number of pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis, lung inflammation, and inflammatory bowel
diseases. While significant progress has been made in understanding apoptotic cell recognition and efferocytic uptake
in recent years, significant gaps remain.
Solute carrier (SLC) proteins are membrane proteins that selectively conduct ions, metabolites, and aminoacids
across the plasma membrane, and specific internal cellular membranes. In the human genome, SLCs represent the
second largest family (after the GPCRs), with ~400 SLC family members. Despite ~100 human diseases being linked
to mutations in SLC genes, the SLC family is relatively understided, including in the immune system 7,8. This may in
part be because the SLCs functionally characterized have often been in isolation, and not many SLCs are studied as
part of a larger biological process. Recently, while studying phagocytes taking up apoptotic cells, we unexpectedly
came across a coordinated regulation of >30 members of the Slc gene family (Morioka et al., Nature 2018; Perry et al,
Nature Cell Biol., 2019). This proposal tests the hypothesis that SLC proteins can play key roles in different phases of
efferocytosis, and that sequential use of specific SLCs during efferocytosis facilitates communication between
phagocytes contributes to maintaining an anti-inflammatory state within tissues."

achievement of the Ending the HIV Epidemic goals requires sociostructural interventions that address social
determinants of health that contribute to inequities. Evidence-based sociostructural interventions exist that
have a direct impact on PrEP, care-related, and viral suppression outcomes, yet they have been much less
studied than individual-level interventions and their implementation poses unique methodological and
institutional challenges. Determining how sociostructural interventions can reduce health inequities, including
implications for implementation and sustainment, is an urgent public health research priority. The
Sociostructural Implementation Science Coordination Initiative (SISCI) hub will bring the best of Dissemination

foster opportunities for cross-site learning, and coordinate research, capacity building, and dissemination
efforts. We will grow the capacity of both researchers and implementers to apply D&I models and methods for
developing, testing, and implementing sociostructural interventions. SISCI investigators and consultative team
are nationally recognized experts in HIV D&I science and have a strong record of coordinating HIV D&I
projects and providing tools and training to the field. The SISCI aims to (1) Assist the companion RO1s through
collaboration, knowledge sharing, and expert consultation on D&I science and social determinants of health
models and methods. We will coordinate in person and virtual communications between companion R01s and
provide tailored methodological support to the projects based on collective needs and opportunities. (2)
Integrate implementation and effectiveness data across R01 studies to collect cross-project data and perform
integrated analyses. Using shared decision making, we will identify common data elements (CDEs) for
collections across projects and plan for integrated analyses. We will deploy data coordination infrastructure to
collect cross-project data and perform integrated analyses—whenever possible obtaining administrative data to
allow new generalizable knowledge beyond what individual projects have studied. We will disseminate findings
on implementation determinants and strategies using our popular HIV implementation science website and
newsletter, conference presentations, and a special journal issue of Companion R01 and other sociostructural
project findings. (3) Advance the field of sociostructural interventions to reduce HIV disparities by developing
and offering a combined D&I science and sociostructural training tailored to early career investigators and
implementation partners. We will further grow the capacity of the field by conducting a scoping review to build a
compendium of promising and proven implementation strategies for sociostructural interventions. We will
support the dissemination of implementation strategies identified in the Companion R01 projects by creation
and dissemination of training materials and policy briefs."

Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by the growth of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow supported
by increased angiogenesis. Despite significant advances in treatments, MM remains incurable due to frequent
relapses originating from MM cells refractory to therapy. Further, MM induces a devastating bone disease,
increasing fracture risk and decreasing quality of life. The long-term goal of this proposal is to improve clinical
outcomes in MM by defining targetable mechanisms underlying MM growth, responses to therapy, and bone
destruction. The rationale stems from work from the previous funding period demonstrating that osteocytes (Ots)
are an abundant and long-lived source of signals in the MM tumor microenvironment (TME) that supports MM
growth and promote bone destruction; and that targeting Ot-MM cell interactions decreases MM growth and
improves bone health. In studies leading to this application, we found that MM cells upregulate the expression
of Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 in Ots and discovered that Ots support angiogenesis and promote resistance
to Bortezomib-based therapies. The specific goal of this proposal is to evaluate the efficacy of targeting local
FGF23 derived from Ots to decrease tumor growth, repair damaged bone, and improve responses to therapy in
MM. The central hypothesis is that Ot-derived FGF23 promotes MM progression, bone destruction, and
refractory disease via local TME autocrine and paracrine signals mediated by the FGF23 co-receptor α-Klotho
(αKL). This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) Determine the contribution of Ot-derived FGF23
to MM tumor growth and bone disease by interfering with paracrine and/or autocrine FGF23-αKL signaling; (2)
Determine the impact of Ot-derived Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), a downstream target of
FGF23, and other osteocyte-derived pro-angeogenic factors on the pathological angiogenesis in the MM-TME;
and (3) Determine the role of FGF23 and the FGF23 target gene Heparanase (HPSE) on TME-induced
resistance to Bortezomib-based therapies in MM cells. These aims will be pursued using a combination of
innovative in vitro, in vivo, and in silico approaches, including cell-specific genetic tools, pharmacological
approaches, human MM xenograft and immunocompentent mouse models of MM, primary cells from MM
patients, scRNAseq analysis, and mining of MM patient genetic/clinical databases."

The ability to bioprint cellular aggregates, such as spheroids, in a high-throughput manner into desired patterns
or cellular microenvironments is crucial to facilitate fabrication of scalable constructs with cell densities similar to
that of native tissues and organs. Despite the progress in spheroid bioprinting technologies, the major
shortcomings associated with them, such as poor positioning of spheroids, significant loss of viability and
structural integrity, poor repeatability of the process when using non-uniform size spheroids, inability to form
complex 3D shapes, and most importantly, the lack of scalability, limit their translation. In this project, we propose
a highly unique technology, henceforth referred as “high-throughput spheroid (HTS) bioprinting,” that enables
simultaneous bioprinting of several spheroids with an order of magnitude size range and minimal cellular
damage, at a high positional precision and an unprecedented speed. The proposed technology is highly versatile
and enables the bioprinting of complex structures either (1) onto the surface of gel substrates (i.e., hydrogels) in
a scaffold-based manner or (2) within support baths (i.e., sacrificial microgels) in a scaffold-free manner for
scalable fabrication of tissues. In Specific Aim 1, we propose to develop HTS bioprinting, which has the capability
of depositing several spheroids simultaneously on 3D gel substrates, thus bioprinting a complete layer of the 3D
tissue at once in a rapid fashion (i.e., 100 spheroids can be bioprinted in <20 sec). We will couple HTS bioprinting
with extrusion-based bioprinting of gel substrates and explore the spheroid-gel interactions, across a wide range
of hydrogels, during the bioprinting process. To exemplify the technology, we will demonstrate bioprinting
intraoperatively via depositing osteogenically-committed bone spheroids for the repair of craniomaxillofacial
bone defects in a rat model. In Specific Aim 2, we will reconfigure the HTS bioprinting technology for freeform
positioning of spheroids within sacrificial support baths. Here, we will bioprint spheroids sequentially (one after
the other) in a rapid manner and pattern them according to the target design. We will explore the gel-spheroid-
bioprinting process interactions, where the effectiveness of the technology will be tested for multiple support
baths, including alginate microgels to be fabricated using the air-jet assisted coaxial flow technique along with a
commercially available benchmark. We will exemplify the utilization of the technology for fabrication of
anatomically-relevant complex-shaped human bronchopulmonary segments. In this regard, we have formed a
complementary collaboration that merges essential domain knowledge in bioprinting, bioprinting process and
instrument development, biomaterials, craniofacial surgery, and bone and lung tissue engineering with the depth
necessary to propel the proposed work towards meaningful advances that would otherwise not be possible.
Successful completion of the proposed work is anticipated to give rise to an advanced bioprinting technology for
HTS bioprinting and thereby provide a novel tool for fabrication of scalable tissues and organs."

This training program aims to train a critical mass of public health researchers to (a) work as principal
investigators leading independent research programs focused on questions of pediatric infectious diseases and
(b) teach infectious disease and nutrition research in Ethiopia. The goal of this training program is to develop
skilled researchers in Ethiopia in the area of pediatric infectious diseases and nutrition. We propose to provide
research training to public health leaders in epidemiological methods, operations and health services,
substantive topic areas, and professional skills, with a focus on childhood diarrheal diseases and acute
respiratory infections. The program will be structured to provide an appropriate balance of short, medium, and
long-term training opportunities in Boston and Ethiopia for participants from Addis Continental Institute of
Public Health and the two collaborating institutions in Ethiopia: Addis Ababa University and Haramaya
University. The principle training strategies are: 18-month postdoctoral fellowships, short-term doctoral
training, intensive short courses, and research symposia. In total, the program will train 8 postdoctoral fellows,
10 short-term doctoral fellows, and provide short course instruction to approximately 300 researchers and
professionals, of whom we anticipate at least 50 to complete a series of four courses to obtain a proposed graduate
certificate in global infectious diseases. Additionally, hundreds will be reached through annual symposia.
Trainees will benefit from exposure to ongoing epidemiological studies, clinical trials, and operations research
programs at participating institutions in Ethiopia. These activities will provide unique training opportunities for
study design and implementation, data analysis and career advancement. Research funds will be awarded to
returning postdoctoral trainees to facilitate integration into the research setting in Ethiopia. Deliverables include
manuscript and research proposal development. Research findings will be disseminated to health care providers,
policy makers, students and faculty at academic institutions, and the broader scientific community via an annual
symposium in Addis Ababa. Harvard and ACIPH faculty with extensive experience in pediatric infectious disease
and nutrition research will mentor trainees throughout the program. A senior-level Training Advisory
Committee will evaluate ongoing research progress and will be charged with program oversight. The training
program will develop a cadre of skilled public health professionals and facilitate sustainable capacity in pediatric
infectious disease and nutrition research in Ethiopia."

During cell division, duplicated chromosomes are segregated by an exquisite molecular machine, the mitotic
spindle. Our goal is to uncover how this machine operates by reconstituting spindle activities and applying
advanced biophysical tools for manipulating and tracking individual molecules. We focus on the components
most central to spindle function, kinetochores, microtubules, and spindle poles. Kinetochores drive
chromosome movements by maintaining persistent, load-bearing attachments to microtubule tips, even as the
tips assemble and disassemble under their grip. Kinetochores also somehow sense when they are
erroneously attached and, if so, they detach and generate diffusible ‘wait’ signals to delay anaphase until
proper attachments are made. Spindle microtubules are organized into a bipolar configuration by the spindle
poles, which also must sustain forces to support chromosome movements and spindle assembly. In past
work, we have developed motility assays where native kinetochores or recombinant kinetochore subcomplexes
are attached to individual dynamic microtubules. Like kinetochores in vivo, the isolated kinetochore particles
remain tip-bound even as the microtubule tips assemble and disassemble – a behavior we call ‘tip-coupling’.
We have also reconstituted attachments between microtubules and spindle pole bodies, the yeast counterparts
of centrosomes, and made the first measurements of their mechanical strength. Altogether our reconstitutions
have enabled us to make key discoveries in major areas of spindle function. By expanding our approach, we
can now attack the essence of many complex, long-standing problems in mitosis, in direct ways that would be
impossible in living cells. Over the next five years, we will focus on several important questions: (1) How do
kinetochores spontaneously self-assemble from their component parts? (2) How are forces transmitted from
the outer microtubule-binding interface through the middle of the kinetochore and ultimately to the centromeric
DNA? (3) How are dynamic behaviors at kinetochores and spindle poles affected by the forces they
experience? (4) How do kinetochores avoid making erroneous attachments? (5) How do unattached or
erroneously attached kinetochores generate ‘wait’ signals to delay the cell cycle? Our work will continue to use
the advanced, feedback-controlled laser traps that we pioneered for measuring kinetochore movement and
spindle pole mechanics. In addition, newly developed fluorescence techniques will allow us to observe
kinetochore assembly at the single molecule level and to monitor dynamic structural changes within individual
kinetochores. By combining laser trapping with fluorescence we will test directly how changes in the
composition and architecture of kinetochores and spindle poles affect their function."
10759396,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sepsis survivors carry over a 3-fold risk of new chronic brain dysfunction, including long-term cognitive and
mood disorders, but risk factors for brain dysfunction in sepsis survivors remain poorly understood. Amyloid
beta (Aβ) pathology is present in 20-50% of cognitively normal individuals over age 60 and is thus a common
risk factor even in sepsis survivors without a preexisting Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis.
Alzheimer’s disease in humans and Aβ pathology in mice increase brain levels of complement receptors which
are critical to innate immunity. The complement system is strongly activated in bacterial sepsis. We therefore
hypothesize that sepsis driven complement ligands in the presence of Aβ induced potentiation of complement
receptors enhance microglial activation and synapse loss, increasing vulnerability to new brain dysfunction. We
will examine the role of complement-driven injury and early Aβ deposition in enhanced brain dysfunction using
a murine model of amyloidosis (5xFAD mice) which have survived sepsis. Specifically, we will:
Aim 1: Determine if sepsis and presymptomatic Aβ deposition enhance complement-mediated
neuroinflammation and synapse loss in 5xFAD sepsis survivor mice. We hypothesize that chronic Aβ
induction of complement receptor C3aR combined with sepsis induced C3 expression results in microglial
activation, increased synaptic phagocytosis, and reduced synaptic transmission.
Aim 2: Determine if sepsis and presymptomatic Aβ deposition enhance complement-mediated
behavioral impairment in 5xFAD sepsis survivor mice. We hypothesize that deficits in spatial memory,
context discrimination, and motivation underly impairments in high level tasks and will determine the
dependence of these deficits on C3 signaling through C3a receptor inhibition or inducible C3 deletion.
Aim 3: Determine if synaptic phagocytosis in 5xFAD sepsis survivor mice is dependent on C3 driven
microglial activation. While others have proposed that microglial senescence contributes to
neurodegeneration, we hypothesize that microglial activation drives Aβ enhanced synapse loss in sepsis.
Using a novel microfluidic cell culture platform, we will determine if C3a signaling in the setting of Alzheimer’s
disease neuropathology is required for enhanced microglial cytokine secretion and synaptosome phagocytosis.
Understanding mechanisms of brain injury in sepsis survivors with Aβ neuropathology will provide an important
basis for personalized strategies in future trials of brain injury prevention directed at complement activation."
10759401,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Huntington’s Disease (HD) is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in exon 1 of the Huntingtin (HTT)
gene that produces mutant HTT mRNA and protein. Expression of mutant HTT leads to progressive
neurodegeneration via mechanisms that are poorly understood. Because HD is a genetically-defined disease, it
is an ideal candidate for study and therapeutic intervention by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) – which
incorporate into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to target and degrade disease-causing genes. With
the development of a divalent (di)-siRNA chemical architecture, siRNAs can be delivered throughout the central
nervous system (CNS) of rodents and non-human primates. To ensure stability in the CNS, di-siRNAs require
chemical modifications on every nucleotide. However, chemical modifications can affect siRNA activity and
cellular localization – limiting the utility and flexibility of di-siRNAs in the CNS.
The most common nucleotide modifications in siRNA replace the 2′OH of the ribose with 2′-Fluoro (2′F) or 2′-O-
Methyl (2′OMe). Recent work suggests that incorporation of 2′OMe and 2′F at certain nucleotide positions may
hinder siRNA loading into RISC or target binding/cleavage by RISC, and may alter the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic
localization of siRNAs. Yet, the limited scope of this work has made it difficult to identify general design
parameters for efficacious, compartment-specific siRNA. With guidance from Drs. Anastasia Khvorova (siRNA
chemistry), Neil Aronin (HD), Phillip Zamore (RNA biochemistry) and Athma Pai (RNA sequencing), this
proposal will systematically assess the impact of modification patterns on siRNA efficacy and cellular localization
in the CNS to optimize siRNAs as an HD therapy and research tool for dissecting HD pathology.
Aim 1 will characterize how siRNA chemical modifications impact RISC loading in vivo and target binding and
cleavage in vitro. To measure how modifications alter RISC loading, a pool of differentially-modified siRNAs will
be injected into the CNS of mice, RISC will be pulled down and loaded siRNAs will be sequenced. To determine
the effect of siRNA chemical modifications on RISC-target interactions, target binding and cleavage kinetics will
be measured for a panel of modified siRNAs using single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence
microscopy. Mechanistic insight into how modifications impact siRNA efficacy in the CNS will provide a
framework with which to design optimized siRNAs to treat HD and other CNS diseases. Aim 2 will use the same
modified siRNA pool from Aim 1 to identify optimal modification patterns for enhanced nuclear localization of
siRNA in the CNS. These data will be used to design efficacious chemically-modified di-siRNAs targeting nuclear
or cytoplasmic-only HTT RNA. These di-siRNA will then be injected into YAC128 HD mice and the effect on
motor deficits, neurodegeneration, and striatal mRNA expression will be assessed. These results will provide
valuable insight into the biology of HD and determine the potential of nuclear RNA-targeting siRNAs as a
therapeutic paradigm for repeat expansion disorders with underlying RNA toxicity."

The Cancer Research and Education to Advance HealTh Equity (CREATE) Partnership’s overarching goals
are to further increase SDSU’s cancer research capacities and expand SDSU’s and UCSD’s emphasis on
cancer health disparities research. Bi-directional community engagement is also a principal feature that is
integrated across every organizational component in the CREATE Partnership and is a strength that SDSU
has built over the last 30 years. Additional goals include developing cancer research opportunities and
pathways for undergraduate, graduate, and medical students, as well as early-stage investigators (ESIs),
which will lead to a future workforce that is more diverse and reflective of the catchment-area population. To
meet these overarching goals, the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Recruit and support diverse ESIs
who have chosen an intentional career goal to become independent, cancer-focused researchers
(Administrative Core and Transforming fAcuLty dEvelopmeNT for Equity [TALENT] Shared Resource); 2)
Conduct catchment-area relevant research and pilot research projects aligned with identified cancer priorities
for the underserved communities in the region (Research and Research Pilot Projects and Planning and
Evaluation Core); 3) Expand and implement cancer, cancer disparities, and community-engaged research
education with a focus on under-represented students across SDSU and UCSD undergraduate, graduate
programs, and medical students (Research Education Core); and 4) Integrate community engagement into all
CREATE Partnership activities (Outreach Core). To achieve these aims, the CREATE Partnership requests the
initial support for two Full Research Projects and one Pilot Research Project designed to provide insight into
the mechanisms (or behaviors) underlying cancer health disparities. All three projects will be jointly led by
SDSU and UCSD Co-Leads; Project 2 is co-led by two under-represented researchers. The Research Projects
will be integrated with the Research Education Core, providing expanded research experiences in cancer,
cancer disparities, and community-engaged research to under-represented undergraduate, graduate, and
medical students. A TALENT Shared Resource will foster the career development of Partnership ESIs. The
Outreach Core will develop new and strengthen existing community-academic partnerships to foster cancer
research, education, and tailored outreach efforts with a focus on the dissemination and implementation of
evidence-based interventions that can reduce the cancer burden. The Partnership is notably bolstered by
strong institutional commitment, an Administrative Core composed of investigators with demonstrated
leadership and organizational capabilities, and a strong Planning and Evaluation Core guided by an external
Program Steering Committee, an Internal Advisory Board, and a Community Advisory Board."
10931510,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The goal of the Administrative Core of the Cancer Research and Education to Advance HealTh Equity
(CREATE) Partnership is to provide strategic leadership and administrative oversight to advance the
overarching goal of the Partnership. This includes providing an efficient infrastructure to support all scientific,
administrative, and fiscal activities of the Partnership to ensure effective synergy within and across San Diego
State University (SDSU) and the UC San Diego (UCSD) Moores Cancer Center (MCC). Additional goals
include developing cancer research opportunities and pathways for undergraduate, graduate, and medical
students as well as early-stage investigators (ESIs), which will lead to a future workforce that is more diverse
and reflective of the catchment-area population. As a single unit, the Administrative Core provides strategic
leadership and administrative oversight to advance Partnership goals. The Core is the glue that keeps the
Partnership together, and due to its extensive experience and history, it is able to provide necessary services
to support an efficient administrative system and infrastructure under the leadership of multiple Principal
Investigators. The Administrative Core is structured so that the Partnership leaders can establish and
implement a highly integrated operation that ensures exponential benefit from the collaboration of the two
institutions. The Core works synergistically to effectively implement the CREATE Partnership activities in
cancer research, research education, early-stage faculty career development, and community outreach. To
accomplish Partnership goals, the CREATE leadership proposes the following Specific Aims: 1) Provide
leadership, coordination, and management to the scientific, administrative, and fiscal components of the
CREATE Partnership. 2) Promote evidence-based and sustainable interactions and build new research
collaborations across the Partnership. 3) Procure scientific and strategic feedback and guidance from internal
and external advisors. 4) Assist in recruitment of ESIs and work with the Transforming fAcuLty dEvelopmeNT
for Equity (TALENT) Shared Resource to support their career development. The AC is positioned to build
strong institutional commitment to cancer research and cancer disparities research, while growing the
Partnership’s research education programs and increasing outreach to the communities and their providers in
the Southern Border Region of California. By the end of this project period, the Partnership intends to grow the
cancer research base at SDSU by at least 25% and the number of peer reviewed funded cancer disparities
and/or community-engaged grants by at least 20%."

Reproductive health care in cancer patients is an unmet need in Imperial County, a medically underserved,
rural region of the Cancer Research and Education to Advance HealTh Equity (CREATE) Partnership’s
catchment area with a predominantly Hispanic population. Reproductive health is a major issue for adolescent
and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors because they can experience higher risks of infertility, adverse
pregnancy outcomes, and unmet informational needs. Reproductive health care effectively reduces risks, but
uptake is low because there are no scalable interventions to support the implementation of routine reproductive
health care in underserved, geographically remote communities. Guided by the Cancer Survivorship Care
Quality Framework, this pilot proposal seeks to adapt and pilot test a multi-component intervention to improve
reproductive health care uptake by female AYA cancer survivors. The intervention has three components
derived from our prior work: 1) a reproductive risk summary (RS) and survivorship care plan on reproductive
health (SCP-R), 2) navigation, and 3) telehealth reproductive consults. In Aim 1, we will adapt the RS and
SCP-R in English and Spanish to be responsive to the cultural, health literacy, and socio-ecological needs of
Latina AYA survivors through focus groups with AYA survivors and parents/guardians, and semi-structured
interviews with healthcare providers. We will also systematically evaluate barriers and facilitators to
reproductive health care in Imperial County and examine how to fit the multi-component intervention to this
setting, through focus groups with survivors and parents/guardians and interviews with healthcare providers
and clinic staff. In Aim 2, we will conduct feasibility testing of the multicomponent intervention in a single arm
pilot hybrid type 1 trial (evaluating effectiveness and observing implementation). The primary outcome is
engagement in reproductive health care by 15 newly diagnosed and 15 post-treatment AYA survivors.
Secondarily, we will qualitatively assess effectiveness, fit and implementation outcomes with AYA survivors,
healthcare providers and health clinic staff. The proposal directly targets a critical health disparity faced by
female AYA survivors in our catchment area and need for partnership between rural community health
professionals and urban specialists to deliver quality reproductive survivorship care. We will generate a novel,
scalable intervention and preliminary data to support a future multi-site trial on intervention effectiveness in
increasing reproductive care in rural, medically underserved oncology settings. The partnership between
SDSU, CRCD and UCSD researchers will be strengthened with collaborative learning, community
engagement, and increased capacity of trainees to support future cancer research in Imperial County."
10761770,"Project Summary / Abstract
This K01 award will allow Dr. Yi (Jody) Ye-Miller to advance her independent research career in the field of
type 1 diabetes (T1D). Dr. Ye’s overarching career goal is to understand the pathogenic mechanisms behind
the genetic and environmental influence of pancreatic beta-cells in T1D and to identify targeted pathways to
improve beta-cell function. The proposed project is carefully conceived, based on Dr.Ye’s previous work and
trains her to use novel models as well as cutting-edge technologies to study the mechanisms underlying T1D.
It is a timely opportunity and excellent training vehicle to enable an extremely talented young scientist to
achieve her career independence. The Albert Einstein College of Medicine is a national leader in medical
education, research, and health care. The institution and Dr. Ye’s mentors will provide a supportive
environment with all the necessary equipment and facilities, as well as many learning opportunities and
guidance for her professional development.
T1D affects 5% of the U.S. population with increasing prevalence in recent decades, especially among young
children. Current therapies are unable to provide long-lasting effects to improve beta cell function. The etiology
of T1D has both genetic and environmental components, but our understanding of the underlying mechanisms
is incomplete, hindering the development of novel therapies. In Dr. Ye’s previous postdoctoral trainings, she
identified two T1D loci, CTSH and PGM1, which showed evidence of genetic and environmental influence.
Both CTSH and PGM1 are expressed in pancreatic beta-cells. Her observations led to the hypothesis that
genetic and/or environment factors influence CTSH and PGM1 transcription and translation, which
alter the function and stress-response of beta-cells that consequently trigger T1D.
In this project, Dr. Ye will use CRISPR-Cas9 technology to modify the expression of CTSH and PGM1 in
human embryonic stem cells. Edited stem cells will subsequently be differentiated into pancreatic beta-cells in
vitro. Dr. Ye will investigate the effect of CTSH and PGM1 on beta-cell function with and without an
environmental stimulus such as viral infection. In addition, Dr. Ye will use a transgenic mouse model to
investigate whether CTSH or its related pathways can be targeted to prevent or slow autoimmune diabetes
development.
CTSH and PGM1 are T1D associated genes, but their beta-cells specific effects have not been thoroughly
studied. The proposed experiments are innovative and original. In a short term, funding will allow Dr. Ye to
establish her career independence in the field of T1D. In a long run, these studies will unravel the pathogenic
mechanisms associated with CTSH and PGM1 loci, allowing the development of new therapies to treat T1D in
humans."
10761774,"The advanced stage of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias is characterized by the onset infections,
which prior work suggests are widely mismanaged. Antimicrobials are extensively prescribed, most often
without evidence to support a bacterial infection. Antimicrobial exposure is the main factor leading to multidrug-
resistant organisms (MDROs); a growing public health threat. Moreover, the benefits of antimicrobials remain
unclear for patients with advanced dementia, for whom infections are often a terminal event and comfort is
most commonly the goal of care. In 2015, our group completed a prospective study of nursing home (NH)
residents with advanced dementia, the Study of Pathogen Resistance and Exposure to Antimicrobials in
Dementia (SPREAD) (parent NIH R01 for this competing renewal). Antimicrobials were prescribed for 72% of
suspected infections, but only 44% episodes met guideline-based criteria for treatment. Criteria were more
likely to be met when proxies were counseled about antimicrobials. Two-thirds of residents were colonized with
MDROs. Antimicrobial use was the major risk factor for MDRO acquisition. Motivated by these findings, the PIs
conducted a pilot study (NIH R21) of an intervention to improve management of suspected urinary (UTIs) and
lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs). With this foundation, the goal of this proposal, TRAIN-AD (Trial to
Reduce Antimicrobial Use In Nursing home residents with Alzheimer’s disease and other Dementias), is to
conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial of the intervention among 480 residents with advanced dementia
(N=240/arm) in 16 Boston-area NHs (N=8/arm). The intervention has two main components: 1. Provider
Training: In-person training, on-line course, management algorithms, and prescribing feedback, and 2. Proxy
Education: booklet. Unlike most antimicrobial stewardship programs, the intervention merges best practices in
infectious diseases and palliative care, and targets a unique population for whom the need to improve infection
management is particularly compelling. The Aims are to compare the following 12-month outcomes between
residents in the intervention and control arms (usual care) related to suspected UTIs and LRIs: Aim 1. total
number of antimicrobial courses/person-year (10 outcome); Aim 2. number of antimicrobial courses prescribed
when guideline-based criteria for treatment are absent/person-year (20 outcome), and Aim 3. i. advance care
planning about infection management, and ii. burdensome procedures/person-days used to evaluate these
episodes/person-year (20 outcomes). IMPLICATIONS: Prior work by our group has demonstrated a critical
need to improve the quality of care for suspected infections in advanced dementia patients. A cluster RCT of
an intervention to optimize infection management is the next logical step. This proposal addresses 3 federal
research priorities: Alzheimer’s disease, palliative care, and antibiotic stewardship. Thus, it has the potential to
make clinical and policy-relevant contributions by promoting patient-centered end-of-life care for millions of
Americans with advanced dementia, and reducing the growing public health threat of MDROs in NHs."

have increased the size of the vulnerable population. Our proposal aims to develop a novel broad spectrum
antifungal therapeutic targeting Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis to treat life threatening
infections due to drug resistant Candida and Aspergillus with no cross resistance to existing agents. Our
Aims are:
Aim 1 (Phase 1). Demonstrate improved efficacy is achievable by optimizing pharmacokinetic (PK)
properties of the series. Perform metabolic identification (MetID) studies on M743, M720, and the hydrolyzed
core lacking the sidechain to identify oxidative metabolic hotspots to guide a limited Lead Optimization (Lead
Opt) effort to improve PK properties of the series while maintaining potency, spectrum, target selectivity, and
minimizing cytotoxicity. Test up to 2 new analogs in a murine systemic infection model of Candidiasis with and
without 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT) PK enhancer codosing. Milestone 1. Based on MetID studies, synthesize
up to 30 new M743 analogs. An analog showing an IP-administered dose-dependent > 3 log10 reduction in
fungal burden in a murine Candidiasis model (i.e. superior to M720 efficacy) with or without ABT codosing will
identify the key (and addressable) liability of the series and warrant advancement of the program to Ph 2.
Aim 2 (Phase 2). M743 scale up, Lead Opt and in vitro characterization of compounds. Produce M743
on scale sufficient to supply a full Lead Opt effort based on MetID data and emerging SAR. Characterize
analogs as in Aim 1 with additional emphasis on PK, MOA, reduced serum binding, and cytotoxicity. Milestone
2. Obtain 3g of M743; semisynthesize up to 100 new analogs. Identify up to 3 analogs with acceptable potency
and PK (without ABT codosing), along with validated target engagement, FOR <1 x 109, in vitro synergy with
Gwt1 inhibitor, APX001A (FICI<0.5), progressible activity in serum, and acceptable toxicity (in vivo cytotoxicity
vs. HepG2, in vitro IC50>10 uM vs ion channels, CYPs, critical PANLABS targets) to advance to Aim 3.
Aim 3 (Phase 2). In vivo Characterization. Efficacy of up to 2 compounds will be tested in a murine
Candidiasis (including codosing with APX001 to evaluate in vivo synergy) and Invasive Pulmonary
Aspergillosis infection models without ABT codosing. Milestone 3. Semisynthesize 200 mg of each test
compound. Demonstrate acceptable MIC90 across Candida/Aspergillus spp. Identify suitable formulation for IP
dosing. Conduct dose-ranging studies to gauge exposures and tolerability at higher doses to guide dose
selection. Top analog achieving dose-dependent efficacy in each infection model (> 3 log reduction in burden
over therapeutic duration) and overall favorable drug-like properties will be selected as a preclinical candidate."
10932262,"Project Summary:
The goal of this project is to create two prototypes of a novel live spike sorting system which can be used by
investigators to spike sort streams of neural data recorded by multi-channel, high channel and ultra-high
channel probes. In most in-vivo extracellular recording conditions, an electrode can pick up neural spikes
from several nearby neurons resulting in so-called “multi-unit” activity in the recording trace. Spike sorting
algorithms are then used to separate this multi-unit activity into several sets of “single-unit” activities, each
of which represents the action potential firing pattern of a single neuron. This sorting process is typically a
computationally intensive process and is growing into a critical technology gap with the advent of multi and
high channel count hardware. Live spike sorting of a complete set of multichannel data has been challenging
if not impossible. On the other hand, there is a demand for live spike sorting during an experiment,
especially by those investigators who record from functionally heterogenous brain areas such as, for
example, all cortical regions. If an investigator had the ability to review live single cell data, he/she could
determine the quality of the data and adjust the electrode position or decide on next experimental steps
based on the incoming results.
We recently developed the GEMsort algorithm, which, compared to existing spike sorting algorithms, was
designed to sort neural spikes from multichannel probes with immediate sorting outcomes. These
algorithms provide powerful, accurate yet computationally inexpensive spike sorting due to a different
mathematical approach. As a result, these algorithms can spike sort complete streams of complex data,
including data recorded with high channel and ultra-high channel electrodes virtually in real time. In this
proposal, we will develop two tabletop-sized systems based on Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)
technology for laboratory use. These systems will be based on the GEMsort algorithm and add live spike
sorting capabilities to an investigator's existing recording setup."
10933468,"It is challenging to build successful research collaborations. Successful collaborations are even more challenging
when working across institutions and with early-stage investigators (ESIs). To overcome these challenges, we
developed the Capacity Building Core. The Core's goal is to provide resources and mentorship to build joint
collaborations between City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (CoHCCC) and University of California,
Riverside (UCR) ESI. We aim to build collaborations that 1) increase UCR capacity for drug development
capacity - at all stages of the drug-develop pipeline and 2) result in independent NIH-funding. The Capacity
Core will match UCR ESIs with senior CoHCCC and UCR investigators. Senior CoHCCC investigators will be
selected based on their prior proven ability to 1) successfully mentor ESIs and 2) help them attain independent
NIH funding. U54 PI, Drs. Ernest Martinez (UCR) and Victoria Seewaldt (CoH) have extensive mentorship
experience and will lead the Capacity Core. Under the Capacity Core, UCR-CoH Mini-Pilots will be 1) crafted by
ESIs under senior mentorship, 2) competed, and 3) teams awarded $100,000 for one year. Our P20 planning
grant shows us that success of a pilot project is increased when ESI have senior mentors from both CoH and
UCR; therefore UCR ESI applying for Mini-Pilots are required to have a CoH and UCR mentor. In Years 1 and
2 a total of 3 Mini-Pilots will be funded/year. These 6 Mini-Pilots will be an important opportunity for us to build
joint UCR ESI-CoH grants and capacity at UCR. In Years 3-5, $200,000 originally allocate to the Capacity
Building Core, will be re-allocated to support two new Pilots – Pilots 3 and 4. In Years 3-5, we will offer 1 Mini-
Pilot/year. CoH discretionary funds ($100,000/year) will allow us to either supplement Pilot Projects or increase
the number of Mini-Pilots offered in Years 3-5."
10761752,"SUMMARY
Lyme disease bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) is highly motile and can traverse complex environments inside
mammalian and arthropod hosts during its infectious cycle. The central hypothesis of this application is that the
motility and chemotaxis of Bb constitute a distinct paradigm and play a pivotal role in the host-vector cycle as well
as in the disease process, including invasion, dissemination, tissue tropism, and immune evasion. During the last
two funding cycles, we revealed several unique aspects of Bb motility and chemotaxis; however, their underlying
molecular mechanisms and precise roles in the disease process remain largely unknown. Building upon our
previous findings, this renewal aims to fill this knowledge gap by addressing three key questions: (1) How does Bb
control asymmetrical flagellar rotation? Due to its unique cell shape and geometry, Bb must rotate its bipolar
periplasmic flagella (PF) asymmetrically in order to run: the anterior PF rotates counterclockwise, and the posterior
PF rotates clockwise. Without asymmetrical rotation, the cells become distorted. This is a hallmark feature of
spirochete motility; however, its underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Aim 1 seeks to unravel this
longstanding conundrum by determining the function and structure of FliG1, a noncanonical flagellar motor switch
protein, using an integrative approach of genetics, biochemistry, cryo-electron tomography, and crystallography.
(2) Has Bb evolved swarming motility to facilitate its invasiveness and virulence? During the enzootic cycle,
on several occasions, Bb swims in highly viscous gel-like environments, such as mammalian dermis tissue and the
tick-gut basement membrane, which are reminiscent of the environments in which bacteria swarm, a form of
movement that allows bacteria to crawl over solid and semi-solid surfaces. It has been speculated that Bb has
evolved swarming motility to empower its invasiveness. Aim 2 plans to delineate the underlying mechanism of
swarming motility and its role in the pathogenicity of Bb, using a comprehensive approach of genetics, biochemistry,
structural biology, and in vivo animal models along with intravital imaging. (3) Does CheA1 control Bb virulence
and, if so, how? Bb has evolved unique chemotaxis to accommodate its distinct motility and enzootic cycle, e.g.,
its genome encodes multiple chemotaxis proteins such as two CheA histidine kinases (HK): CheA1 and CheA2. A
longstanding question is why Bb needs multiple chemotaxis proteins. CheA2, but not CheA1, is essential for Bb
chemotaxis. The role of CheA1 remains unknown. Interestingly, we recently found that CheA1 is required for Bb
hematogenous dissemination in mice and expression of several key virulence factors of Bb. Building upon these
results, Aim 3 proposes to elucidate the role and underlying molecular mechanism of CheA1 in Bb pathogenicity,
using a multidisciplinary approach of genetics, biochemistry, RNA-seq, and animal models. Achievement of these
aims will lead to a better understanding of Bb motility and chemotaxis as well as their precise roles in the
pathogenesis of Lyme disease. Moreover, the fundamental knowledge to be gained is highly impactful and likely to
aid understanding of these processes in other pathogenic spirochetes as well."
10912013,"1 PROJECT SUMMARY
 2 There is an urgent need for a therapeutic that rapidly deactivates and removes fentanyl from
 3 the body. As stated by Dr. Nora Volkow, “Deaths from fentanyl are increasing in spite of naloxone, and overdose
 4 requires multiple naloxone doses.” This is a nationwide crisis, with over 73,000 overdose deaths annually, and
 5 over 3M people living with opioid use disorder. Naloxone blocks mu-opioid receptors for a short period of time
 6 without affecting the level of fentanyl in the body, which can result in renarcotization. A single-dose therapeutic
 7 is needed that restores respiration immediately and removes fentanyl from the body at the maximum possible
 8 rate, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), eliminating the possibility of renarcotization.
 9 Our therapeutic agent, CS-1103, which works differently than naloxone, meets this need. After
10 injection, CS-1103 binds to fentanyl in the bloodstream, rapidly reversing its effects, and dramatically increases
11 the rate of fentanyl clearance into urine to near the GFR. In small and large animal models, we have
12 demonstrated that CS-1103 is effective against synthetic opioids, ranging from fentanyl to carfentanil, restoring
13 respiration in 2-3 min, reversing muscle rigidity in 1 min, preventing renarcotization after a lethal dose of
14 carfentanil, and rapidly lowering opioid levels in the body. Furthermore, CS-1103 causes milder opioid
15 withdrawal compared to naloxone, and does not interfere with the activity of naloxone.
16 We are currently developing IV CS-1103 to treat acute intoxication caused by drugs of abuse including
17 methamphetamine. We have completed all required nonclinical studies and anticipate completion of the First-
18 in-Human Phase 1a clinical trial in mid-2023. Based on results to date, we believe that Phase 1a has a high
19 probability of success, as CS-1103: (1) is a single use drug; (2) has an excellent safety profile in GLP studies in
20 rat and canine with rapid clearance, at doses 500x the expected human therapeutic dose, similar to the
21 sequestrants BRIDION® and Captisol®; and (3) is highly effective and safe in non-human primates (NHP).
22 Our primary goal in this effort is to develop an IV formulation of CS-1103 for treatment of fentanyl intoxication
23 and obtain FDA approval. This will be achieved via completion of Specific Aims 1-5 (UG3) and 6-9 (UH3):
24 Aim 1 will complete a pre-IND meeting with FDA for IV CS-1103. Aim 2 will establish the safety/toxicology
25 profile of IV CS-1103 in the presence of fentanyl, in rat. Aim 3 will demonstrate that IV CS-1103 lowers the level
26 of fentanyl in a dose-dependent manner, in rat. Aim 4 will submit IND for IV CS-1103. Aim 5 will establish the
27 safety/dose level of IV CS-1103, in the presence of fentanyl, in a Phase 1b clinical trial. Aim 6 will determine
28 effective clinical dose of CS-1103 to treat fentanyl intoxication in a Phase 2a clinical trial. Aim 7 will demonstrate
29 efficacy of IV CS-1103 in lowering the level of fentanyl and restoring respiration, in a pivotal Phase 2b trial. Aim
30 8 will submit NDA for IV CS-1103. Aim 9 will perform IND-enabling studies for CS-1103 suitable for IM
31 injection and/or IN administration. Aim 9 will be completed using our own funds, to expand use to field settings."

Major birth defects (BDs) affect morbidity and mortality of tens of thousands of newborns annually in the US.
Environmental (i.e. non-inherited) exposures or gene variants are estimated to explain about one-third of BDs
that occur. Since 1996, the Iowa Center for Birth Defects Research and Prevention (CBDRP) has played a
leadership role in surveillance and research of major BDs. Partnerships with the State of Iowa Department of
Health and Human Services and Iowa Registry for Congenital and Inherited Disorders have allowed the Iowa
CBDRP timely access to comprehensive surveillance data on deliveries to Iowa resident mothers for
enrollment in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study and Birth Defects Study To Evaluate Pregnancy
exposureS (BD-STEPS). Using exposure and genomic data collected, the Iowa CBDRP has made substantial
contributions to understanding the etiopathogenesis of major BDs, ranging from prevalence estimates to gene-
environmental interaction effects, with this work being disseminated in high-impact journals. Findings published
support multifactorial inheritance patterns that vary among BDs across system groups and among BD
subtypes within a system group. These findings of a heterogeneous etiopathogenesis reinforces the need to
continue to investigate major BD phenotypes individually. With this application, the Iowa CBDRP proposes to
continue its successful participation in BD-STEPS by timely ascertaining and classifying pregnancies with and
without specific major BDs (Aim 1) and developing and evaluating novel modes of exposure data collection
(Aim 2). Using data collected, the Iowa CBDRP proposes to expand the traditional epidemiology approach by
integrating a multi-omics systems epidemiology approach to more fully investigate risk factors for specific
major BDs (Aim 3). The traditional epidemiology approach will be used to examine associations between BD-
STEPS exposure data and defects, with international datasets used to conduct confirmation analyses. The
systems epidemiology approach will incorporate state-of-the-art genomic studies and machine learning
analytics to improve characterization of child phenomes and exposomes and examine gene-environmental
interaction effects. Concurrent with the proposed study activities will be training bachelor’s, predoctoral and
postdoctoral research scholars to advance the next generation of birth defect researchers (Aim 4). The
proposed research and training are not only consistent with BD-STEPS required activities (RFA-DD-23-001)
but expands and innovates such activities by improved delineation of exposure pathways and genetic
susceptibilities influencing development of specific major BDs. The interdisciplinary expertise of our key
personnel and collaborators, along with access to rich exposure and biological data from independent
populations, provides the Iowa CBDRP unique resources among all CBDRPs in disseminating novel findings in
peer-reviewed publications. Findings generated will provide critical insights into modifiable risk factors for major
BDs and be used for family education, treatment improvements, and application of prevention strategies."
10767865,"Enteric pathogens represent a major group of disease-causing agents, and must overcome the physical and
immunological barrier of the gastrointestinal tract. The resident microbiota presents with a large array of ligands
and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) which can prime immune defenses, through pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs), both on enterocytes and immune resident cells. Indeed, microbial-derived TLR
ligands are necessary for the development and maintenance of the intestinal barrier and immune homeostasis.
Moreover, the microbiota is not static and imbalanced bacterial communities, termed dysbiosis, impact immunity,
in particular during aging. Aging is associated with increased susceptibility to enteric pathogens, and how the
dysbiotic microbiota alters susceptibility is largely unknown. The complement of microbial-derived ligands that
are sensed and that can prime antiviral immunity is incomplete. A better understanding of the molecular
mechanisms by which immunity is maintained, how the microbiota and epithelia interact, and how this impacts
infection and pathogenesis has the potential to reveal novel strategies to treat enteric viral infections. Studies
exploring the role of the microbiota and host genes in the context of aging in enteric infections are challenging
in small animal models due to costs and technical hurdles. To overcome our gap in knowledge of the molecular
mechanisms that control enteric viral infection, we developed an oral model of infection using the powerful
genetic model organism, Drosophila. We found that the gut presents a high barrier to infection: young wild type
flies are refractory to oral challenge with human viruses, while inoculation into the body cavity, which bypasses
the gut, results in robust infection. The spectrum of antiviral pathways engaged in the gut, and how the microbiota
shapes immunity in the intestine is incompletely understood. Preliminarily, we found that Drosophila STING
controls infection in the intestine; dSTING mutants are more susceptible to enteric viral infection. STING is known
to be activated by cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs). While cGAS can produce CDNs endogenously, STING can also
be activated by bacterially derived CDNs. This led us to explore the possibility that commensal bacteria-derived
CDNs may impact innate defenses in the gut through STING, as it is known that microbiota-derived CDNs are
present in the gut. Our new data identifies a role for microbiota-derived CDNs in antiviral defense. Ablation of
the microbiota in young animals leads to increased infection, and feeding these microbiota-deficient flies CDNs
was protective. In Aim 1 we will define the role of dSTING in antiviral defense and in Aim 2 we will define the role
of commensal-derived CDNs in antiviral defense in young and old animals."
10767867,"Project Summary
 The conformation of chromatin is a primary mechanism by which the cell regulates DNA-templated
processes. Consistent with this broad role, aberrations in the enzymes and structural components responsible
for controlling chromatin dynamics have been linked to an extensive range of human diseases, including the
majority of cancers and an increasing number of genetic and developmental disorders. Recent technological
advancements have increased our knowledge of how the positions of nucleosomes on DNA are regulated and
how chromatin forms large three-dimensional (3D) loops called chromatin domains. 3D chromatin structure is
hypothesized to be capable of both promoting and inhibiting transcription depending on context. However,
understanding the mechanisms and functions of these types of chromatin structures has been difficult due to
the low resolution of current methods, which have made it almost impossible to determine chromatin structure
within cells at scales necessary to determine its relationship to the expression of single-genes. As a result, the
long-held hypothesis that 3D chromatin structure at this level regulates transcription has been largely untested
in a physiological context. To examine 3D chromatin structure in cells in which it is expected to function
extensively, the candidate has implemented a genomics method capable of mapping 3D chromatin structure
genome-wide at unprecedented single-nucleosome 150 base pair resolution in quiescent S. cerevisiae.
Quiescent yeast bear conserved hallmarks of quiescent cells, in particular widespread transcriptional
repression and chromatin condensation, which make them an excellent model for determining the mechanisms
by which 3D chromatin structure represses transcription. Preliminary results have led to the hypothesis that in
quiescent cells, the condensin complex represses transcription by inducing quiescence-specific 3D chromatin
structures. Aim 1 of this proposal will determine how condensin is targeted to form chromatin domains during
quiescence using genomics, microscopy, and a single-molecule magnetic tweezer assay. Aim 2 will examine
the conformation of chromatin within domains to determine if it is folded into 3D structure at a smaller scale
and investigate whether chromatin structure at this scale is the mechanism by which transcription is repressed
during quiescence. The mentored component of this work will be completed under the sponsorship of Dr.
Toshio Tsukiyama, an expert in the chromatin field, at one of the premier institutes for basic science and
cancer research, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. The candidate will also be trained in single-
molecule biochemical assays under the supervision of Dr. Sue Biggins, and will expand her proficiency in
bioinformatics through coursework and independent study. This research and training will provide the
candidate with an exciting model system and the skills necessary for a successful independent career."
10767925,"Project Summary
The cerebellum is part of the mammalian hindbrain which plays important roles in motor control and some
cognitive functions, such as language and spatial memory. Although these functions are complex, the continued
development after birth and simple structure of the cerebellum make it unique model for understanding
postnatal regulation of gene expression, proliferation, and differentiation. Interestingly, the same signaling
pathways that play a role in normal cerebellar development are commonly hijacked and altered in cancers, such
as medulloblastoma (MB) – the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor. MB is divided into four
subgroups, where mutations in these signaling pathways are known to occur in the SHH and WNT subgroups,
with very few recurrent alterations in Group3 and 4 tumors. Recent studies, however, have identified a number
of overexpressed developmentally regulated genes that are attractive therapeutic targets. Y-box binding protein
1, YBX1, recently identified to control proliferation/differentiation in the developing embryonic brain, is highly
expressed in the cerebellum during both proliferative and differentiation phases. Further, YBX1 levels are high
in all subgroups of medulloblastoma with the highest expression seen in high-MYC expressing MBs (Group3-
G3). Therefore, understanding the functional role of YBX1 in both cerebellar development and in
medulloblastoma is highly relevant. Our preliminary studies show that YBX1 is required for proper specification
of the cerebellum and that loss of Ybx1 diminishes the growth of G3 MB in vivo. The three aims of this proposal
are to: 1) determine the role and function of YBX1 in regulating proliferation/differentiation of cerebellar
progenitors, 2) assess the requirement of YBX1 in initiation and progression of medulloblastoma using both
human and mouse models, and 3) identify target genes and epigenetic alterations downstream of YBX1. Finally,
I will assess if direct antagonism of YBX1 can inhibit tumor growth. This study will uncover new gene regulatory
networks of cerebellar development as well as those which regulate MB initiation and progression, leading to
the identification of novel targets. The integration of neurodevelopment, stem cell biology, biochemistry, and
cancer biology make this an innovative research proposal that will be significant for increasing knowledge about
the normal functions of YBX1 as well as solidifying it as a pharmacological target in G3 MB. This proposal builds
upon my strong background in epigenetics, stem cell biology, and cancer biology from both my pre- and post-
doctoral fellowships. My short-term career goal is to obtain a research faculty position at a leading institution
where I will focus on understanding epigenetic mechanisms in normal development and tumorigenesis. With
assistance from core facilities here at St. Jude and my future institution as well as collaborations both old and
new, this award will allow for further training in CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and bioinformatics analysis.
Completion of this proposal will put me in a perfect position to continue work towards my long-term goal of
fulfilling the NCI mission “to advance scientific knowledge and help all people live healthier, longer lives.”"
10767930,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Valvular aortic stenosis (VAS) accounts for approximately 3-6% of all congenital heart defects,1 and if left
untreated can lead to congestive heart failure in neonates and young infants. Non-invasive, percutaneous
balloon valvuloplasty (BVP) is the preferred first step of treatment in pediatrics with the intent to postpone
definitive surgery. Outcomes show that while BVP significantly reduces aortic valve (AoV) peak gradient within
the first 24 hours in the majority of patients, by the 2-3 year follow up more than half re-stenose and require
surgical intervention to repair or replace the dysmorphic and failing valve.2, 3 Therefore, while BVP is favorable
in some patients, others are diagnosed with poor clinical outcomes and it is not clear why.
 Studies report that BVP can injure or even rupture the AoV,4, 5 and studies in rabbits have shown that
balloon inflation specifically injures the endothelium.6, 7 Furthermore, our work in mice strongly suggests that
direct injury to, or targeted dysfunction of the valve endothelium causes structural deterioration and functional
impairment of the AoV, consistent with histological studies in humans reporting poor endothelial integrity in
diseased valve tissue.8-11 Taken together, these studies suggest that endothelial damage is a significant
contributor of valve pathology, and this may underlie poor outcomes observed in VAS patients following BVP.
This raises the question: Can restoring endothelial function be an effective therapeutic strategy to treat structural
and functional deterioration of the AoV in susceptible individuals? To explore this, we developed a surgical
mouse model of AoV endothelial injury that causes structural and functional deterioration. Using this model, we
show that in response to injury, young healthy mice activate a beneficial intrinsic reparative response that leads
to endothelial restoration, while this response is impaired in aging mice with known endothelial dysfunction.12 In
addition, we propose a mechanism underlying these diverse responses. This proposal will test the overall
hypothesis that: The beneficial intrinsic reparative response of the injured valve endothelium requires Tgf1-
Cthrc1 signaling between valve endothelial, and underlying valve interstitial cells to promote proliferation and
migration of neighboring uninjured cells, leading to endothelial restoration.
 To test this, we propose three specific aims: 1) Determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms
involved in the beneficial intrinsic response following AoV endothelial injury; 2) Determine the requirement of
endothelial-Tgf1 for the beneficial intrinsic reparative response of the injured AoV endothelium; and 3) Identify
interstitial-Cthrc1 as a critical factor for the beneficial intrinsic reparative response of the injured AoV
endothelium. Successful completion will define innovative mechanisms of the intrinsic reparative response as a
result of AoV endothelial injury that can be applied to the therapeutic design of mechanistic-based compounds
to promote endothelial restoration and prevent structural and functional deterioration, particularly in susceptible
individuals."
10768166,"Translational Therapy Shared Resource Summary
Transitioning sophisticated laboratory assays and the manufacturing of biotherapeutic products to the clinic
often represents a significant hurdle for translation of laboratory studies to patient care. The purpose of the
Translational Therapy Shared Resource (TTSR) is to provide state-of-the-art translational research support
services to Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) members to facilitate the monitoring of clinical trials and the
development of novel cellular and immune-based therapies. TTSR works directly with members of the
Scientific Programs at the preclinical, clinical, and laboratory levels, with the goal of developing clinical trials to
test novel therapies. It does this through the following specific aims: 1) To provide immune monitoring and
biorepository management for clinical studies and trials, 2) To provide a cGMP-compliant facility to
manufacture therapeutic biological products, and 3) To develop novel cellular and immune-based therapies.
TTSR has 2 major components: the Translational Therapy Laboratory (TTL) and Molecular and Cellular
Therapeutics (MCT). TTL provides immune monitoring and biorepository management; it is the central
laboratory that processes research blood samples from patients enrolled in clinical trials. MCT is a cGMP-
compliant production facility. TTSR collaborates with investigators in the Immunology and Transplant and
Cellular Therapy Programs to first procure, select, and manipulate cellular products in the basic or preclinical
research setting and then in large-scale preclinical validation runs leading to the production of these products
in the GMP facility. Once trials begin, TTL processes samples from the trials and provides biologic correlates of
how the products created by the MCT facility are performing. TTSR also collaborates with the Clinical
Informatics Shared Resource and the Cancer Research Translational Initiative to assist investigators in
correlating clinical outcomes with product characteristics and any alterations in host immune function.
Martin Felices, PhD, Associate Professor of Medicine (Immunology Program), and John Wager, MD, Professor
of Pediatrics (Transplant and Cellular Therapy Program [TCT]) co-lead TTSR and are supported by David
McKenna, MD, Medical Director of MCT (TCT), and Rose Wangen, Coordinator of TTL. In fiscal year 2022, 38
people used TTSR, including 33 MCC members."
10768685,"Neuro-Oncology Program
Project Summary / Abstract
Neuro-Oncology has been a CCSG disease-based Program since 2005, with the mission to improve standards
of care for cancers of the nervous system. The Program features a broad portfolio of research initiatives in the
general clinical disciplines and in therapeutically relevant scientific areas. Over the past two funding cycles, we
prioritized work on astrocytomas – the most lethal brain tumor of adults and the most common brain tumor of
childhood. Going forward, we will extend our work on astrocytomas and broaden our clinical and translational
profile with an initiative on hereditary and sporadic neoplasms driven by loss-of-function mutations in the
Neurofibromin 2 (NF2) gene. We will also explore new therapeutic opportunities from the emerging field of
cancer neuroscience. In accord with the Director’s Strategic Vision, contemporary tools of medicinal chemistry
will be brought to bear upon “undruggable” oncogenic drivers and tumor-specific, epigenetic, and metabolic
vulnerabilities will be exploited as therapeutic targets. The immunosuppressive glioma microenvironment will
be targeted with personalized, synthetic peptide neoantigen vaccines and with bi-valent CART cells that
release anti-EGFR antibodies within the local environment of tumor cells.
Skill sets of the leadership team (T. BatchelorBWH, D. Haas-KoganDFCI/BCH/BWH, S. PlotkinMGH, and M. SuvaMGH)
align with Program strategies and research priorities. The Program’s 98 members (87 primary and 11
secondary) draw from all seven DF/HCC institutions and 15 academic departments. Peer-reviewed funding in
2019 was $13.1 M (direct costs, representing an increase from $12.2M reported in 2014), of which $8.9 M was
from NCI. Components of the support package include a renewed SPORE grant on glioma a K12 training grant
on Neuro Oncology. From 2016 to 2019, Program primary members generated 955 peer-reviewed
publications. Inter-programmatic collaborations are reflected in 41% of these publications and intra-
programmatic collaborations in 27%, while 26% represent inter-institutional collaborations.
Going forward, we have five specific aims across the lifespan of central nervous system cancers. Aim one
targets epigenetic vulnerabilities for diffuse midline glioma (DMG) - a uniformly fatal pediatric brain cancer. Aim
two exploits “addictions” to druggable chromatin modifiers and metabolic pathways in grade 4 IDH-mutant
astrocytomas of young adults. Aim three is to advance immunotherapy for IDH WT adult glioblastoma beyond
the currently limited paradigm of immune checkpoint blockade. Aim four targets genetically validated protein
kinases that may serve as downstream effectors of proliferation in NF2-deficient CNS tumors including
meningiomas, schwannomas, and ependymomas. Aim five targets gliomagenic functions of microglia and
electrically active neurons within the tumor microenvironment."
10768688,"Gastrointestinal Malignancies Program
Project Summary / Abstract
The overarching goals of the Gastrointestinal Malignancies Program are to prevent, detect early, and manage
more accurately and effectively the treatment of GI malignancies, while addressing key issues related to health
disparities. The Program will apply cutting-edge genomic technologies to identify genetic and epigenetic
changes that are important in initiation and progression of GI cancers, as well as their response to therapy.
Discovery and application of molecular and genomic biomarkers, identified in part through advances in cell-free
DNA technologies, represent one important focus. The Program’s scope extends across a range of cancers:
esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, hepatobiliary, and colorectal. Many of these cancers have disproportionately
high burdens or incidence in our catchment area (Massachusetts) or among historically disadvantaged
populations; accordingly, DF/HCC has designated these cancers as a high priority for the Center to tackle.
The Program’s 112 members (82 primary and 30 secondary) represent all seven DF/HCC institutions and 14
academic departments. In 2019, peer-reviewed grant funding attributed to the Program was $4.4 million in
direct costs from the NCI and $7.0 million from other sponsors. During the current funding period, primary
Program members published 1,461 cancer-relevant papers. Of these, 24% were inter-institutional, 23% were
intra-programmatic, and 43% were inter-programmatic collaborations between two or more DF/HCC members.
These numbers reflect the Cancer Center’s emphasis on collaborative research guided by a strategic vision.
For the next CCSG finding period, the Program’s 5 specific aims are to : 1) Leverage genome-scale analyses
and laboratory and patient-derived models to identify novel molecular vulnerabilities and precision oncology
strategies in GI malignancies; 2) Harness emerging technologies and collaborative translational efforts to
define the impact of tumor heterogeneity and mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies in GI cancers; 3)
Define the tumor microenvironment in GI cancers and identify key mechanisms of response or resistance to
immunotherapies; 4) Design and execute novel targeted therapy and immunotherapy clinical trials and key
correlative studies for GI malignancies; and 5) Develop early cancer detection approaches and early cancer
intervention clinical trials for GI cancers cross multiple populations, especially underserved communities. To
execute these Aims, we will take full advantage of DF/HCC’s collaborative infrastructure, core facilities, clinical
trials apparatus, and structured processes for community engagement and cancer research training."

Project Summary / Abstract
The Lung Cancer Program conducts innovative research on lung cancer causes and pathogenesis, focusing
on discoveries that improve prevention, diagnosis, and therapy. The Program leverages expertise across all
DF/HCC institutions in smoking cessation, lung cancer screening, genetic susceptibility, genomic changes in
lung cancer, preclinical and clinical studies of novel therapies, and molecular analysis of tumors before and
after targeted and immunotherapeutic agents. A core strength of the Program is an integral bidirectional link
between the laboratory and clinic, which has enabled insights into drug resistance and accelerated clinical
development of agents to overcome newly identified vulnerabilities. Community engagement is embedded in
the Program’s laboratory, preventive, cancer screening, and clinical efforts.
The Program’s 69 members (51 primary and 18 secondary) represent six DF/HCC institutions and 11
academic departments. In 2019, peer-reviewed grant funding attributed to the Program was $6.5 million in
direct costs from the NCI and $2.6 million from other sponsors. During the current funding period, primary
Program members published 1,004 cancer-relevant papers. Of these, 27% were inter-institutional, 27% were
intra-programmatic, and 42% were inter-programmatic collaborations between two or more DF/HCC members.
To achieve the Program mission, we propose the following Specific Aims during the next CCSG funding
period: 1) Identify environmental, social, and genomic determinants of lung cancer risk and their role in
susceptibility, pathogenesis, and prognosis of lung cancer, both in underserved and broader populations; 2)
Define pathogenic mechanisms that underlie the development and evolution of lung cancer; 3) Exploit the
discoveries in cell biology to characterize signaling pathway activated by driver oncogenes to develop novel
therapeutic approaches to thoracic malignancies; 4) Characterize the mechanisms of primary and acquired
resistance to targeted therapy and develop new methods to overcome resistance; and 5) Identify critical
tumor-intrinsic, tumor microenvironment, and host determinants of response to immunotherapy across lung
cancer subtypes.
Each of these Aims is intimately related to the DF/HCC strategic plan. To achieve them, Program members
will depend heavily on CCSG support in the form of shared resources, a clinical trials infrastructure,
exceptional collaborative opportunities, processes for community engagement, and established structures
to train junior investigators."

seminal contributions to both the basic understanding of melanoma and the management of patients, with
direct impact on vastly improved clinical outcomes. Our collaborative research is embodied in part in a
patient biopsy program coordinated by surgical and medical oncologists and dermatopathologists. Well-
annotated tumor samples before, during, and after therapy enable deep understanding of genomic and
molecular evolution in melanoma and address questions related to treatment responsiveness; this tumor
bank is widely shared with investigators within and well beyond the Cancer Center. Beyond this resource,
the Program has deep roots in basic research, translation, pivotal clinical trials, and in training outstanding
melanoma researchers.

The DF/HCC Kidney Cancer Program performs innovative basic research into the molecular basis of kidney
tumors. Scientific efforts within the current funding period focused on identifying meaningful biomarkers for
early detection and prognosis, underlying mechanisms of disease biology, novel therapeutic targets for the
various kidney cancer populations, and improved preclinical models for preliminary validation of these findings.
The Program has made notable advances in mechanism-based classification and treatment of kidney cancers,
rewarded by marked improvements in patient outcomes and with the 2019 Nobel Prize in Medicine awarded to
longstanding SPORE co-leader W.KaelinDFCI for his seminal discovery of the mechanism by which cells sense

10778208,"A subset of cytochrome P450 enzymes perform the first and rate-limiting step in the clearance of foreign
small molecule drugs and toxins from the human body, while others play key roles in endogenous pathways. Of
necessity the former evolved the flexibility to bind and oxidize a broad range of small molecule chemical
scaffolds, while the latter appear to be less flexible and have more substrate specificity. What we know about
the structures of all of these membrane proteins has been determined solely by X-ray crystallography. This
approach provides detailed information about atomic-level protein/ligand interactions, but has not been applied
across the human spectrum of P450 enzymes and does not capture the range of conformations these enzymes
are capable of adopting or their interactions with other proteins. Thus application of a cross-section of structural
techniques is essential to provide the information needed to understand which P450 enzymes bind which small
molecules, how they are bound, and what the products will be. This information is critical for understanding
drug/toxin metabolism to forms that may be either active or inactive, adverse interactions of two drugs at the
same P450 active site, and endogenous pathways related to diverse diseases.
The applicant's long-term research goal is to promote understanding of the structure/function principles that
control substrate and inhibitor interactions with P450 enzymes, in order that this information can be exploited to
more effectively prevent and treat human disease. The objective of this proposal is to generate structures of new
human cytochrome P450 enzymes with the critical components of the catalytic system: their ligands·, redox
partner proteins, and eventually the membrane. A number of human cytochrome P450 enzymes do not have
structures available and none have structures with their catalytic partner proteins. These are gaps we propose
to bridge using the following approaches, building on our previous structural expertise with more than 20 human
cytochrome P450 enzymes and a collaboration with cryo-electron microscopist Dr. Melanie Ohi.
Specific aim 1: Determine structures of human P450 enzymes.
A structure exists for only about half of the 57 human cytochrome P450 enzymes. Many of those without
structures are involved in key homeostatic pathways involving bile acids, fatty acids, eicosanoids, and vitamins,
impeding our understanding of a number of corresponding diseases. We take advantage of this R37 extension
opportunity to propose a small-scale structural genomics project to ""close the gap"" by determining structures of
as many of these P450 enzymes as possible. As we have done successfully for many other human P450
enzymes, we will 1) engineer synthetic genes in ways that usually produce P450 holoproteins, 2) undertake
expression and purification trials, and 3) subject those yielding enough active P450 protein to crystallization for
X-ray structure determination. We will initially focus on those responsible for bile acid and fatty acid synthesis
as we have additional expertise and tools to support success in these areas. As specific ligands can be critical
for stability and crystallization, we will use a range of nonspecific luminescent P450 substrates to screen ligands
that bind each P450 tightly and are likely to facilitate crystallization, as has been successful for CYP1A 1. In
cases where protein is generated but crystallization does not occur (CYP2S1, CYP2W1, CYP3A7, CYP2F
currently in hand), we will initiate structures using cryoEM. Preliminary studies in collaboration with Dr. Melanie
Ohi have very quickly yielded a small data set for CYP3A4 with 2D resolution good enough to visualize alpha
helices. Even if crystallization is successful with a particular P450 enzyme, this latter approach is independently
valuable as it is likely to reveal P450 ""open"" conformations that must exist but are usually not obtained in crystals.
Specific aim 2: Determine structural effects of cytochrome bs and reductase binding to human P450
enzymes.
There are no structures of b5 or reductase binding to any human P450 enzymes. Over the last grant period
we used NMR to identify the two b5. surfaces that differentially bind individual cytochrome P450 enzymes. The
next step proposed is to use NMR to identify the opposing surfaces on individual P450 enzymes and the effects
that b5 binding has on the conformation of these P450 enzymes and their interactions with ligands. We know
from our previous studies that when b5. binds CYP17 A1 that major conformational changes occur on the opposite
face of the P450, which is normally involved in membrane binding and ligand entry/exit from the active site. It is
unclear if this is generally true. Advanced labeling techniques and substrate-directed NMR will be used to answer
these questions. Finally, we will employ our P450/redox partner fusion constructs to elucidate the feasibility of
determining structures of selected complexes using cryoEM.
Overall, our ability to probe P450 structure using orthogonal techniques, supported by the preliminary data
and expertise already developed under this grant, uniquely qualify us to expand research into these areas. Upon
completion, we expect to have significantly expanded the structures available for multiple human P450 enzymes
of significant interest with respect to a broad range of human diseases."

Basal-like carcinoma is a rapidly-progressing and highly variable subtype of breast cancer that arises
spontaneously (often in African Americans) or in genetically predisposed women. Such tumors are believed to
arise from the functional loss of the BRCA1 and TP53 tumor suppressors in uncommitted basoluminal
progenitors of the breast. However, it has been challenging to dissect the origins of the disease for lack of
appropriate tools, making it difficult to conceive of how the cell-state variability of premalignant mutants gives
rise to basal-like breast cancer. The long-term goal of this work is to identify the critical cellular and molecular
transitions underlying basal-like breast cancer genetics. The current application deploys a novel genetically
engineered mouse model called mosaic analysis of double markers (MADM), which randomly deletes murine
Brca1–Trp53 in transit-amplifying progenitors of the mammary gland. In MADM, stochastic deletion is
genetically defined by coexpression of GFP, allowing locally expanded premalignant lesions to be visualized
within the gland before the onset of basal-like disease. We found that premalignant expansion is accompanied
by extensive recruitment of specific immune subsets, suggesting they play crucial roles in tumorigenesis. Our
objective is to combine MADM with innovative methods for dissociation-free transcriptomics that will identify
cell-state variabilities within mutant epithelial cells and the infiltrating immune lineages of a premalignancy.
The hypothesis is that epithelial-cell plasticity and the stromal microenvironment coordinately diversify mutant
lesions, revealing premalignant transcriptional states that ultimately progress to basal-like cancer in the breast
and mammary gland. The aims of the proposal are: 1) To define shared premalignant trajectories of
basoluminal diversification triggered by BRCA1–TP53 deficiency in mice and humans. 2) To deconvolve the
immune heterogeneities that are locally paired with specific premalignant ecosystems for basal-like breast
cancer. 3) To functionally validate cell states important for progression by using genetic, pharmacologic, and
paracrine perturbations that homogenize intrinsic or extrinsic variability of premalignant cells ex vivo. Co-PIs
Janes and Zong are thought leaders in their respective fields of intratumor cell-state heterogeneity and
genetically engineered mouse modeling with a multi-year track record of collaboration. Together with a pair of
senior clinicians, the team is poised to have a significant overall impact on our understanding of basal-like
breast tumorigenesis."

10768618,"Summary
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), with medical or surgical castration, is the long-standing frontline treatment
for advanced prostate cancer. Phase 3 trials show a profound survival benefit for addition of 1 of 4 agents
(abiraterone, docetaxel, enzalutamide or apalutamide) to intensify treatment with ADT. Unfortunately, drug
resistance eventually occurs, and disease almost always progresses as lethal castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC). Regeneration of potent androgens that stimulate the androgen receptor (AR) is a major driver
of resistance, as is evidenced by the survival benefit conferred by blocking androgen synthesis (e.g., CYP17A1
inhibition) or directly blocking AR with potent antagonists. 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the major androgen
that binds AR, and clinical studies of CRPC have consistently shown that intratumoral DHT is elevated to
physiologically relevant levels. Genetic clinical evidence now demonstrates a clear role for 3β-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase-1 (3βHSD1) in treatment resistance. The regeneration of DHT during ADT is due to intratumoral
androgen synthesis from precursors that may originate via de novo steroidogenesis from cholesterol or utilization
of adrenal precursor steroids. There are at least 3 possible pathways to DHT synthesis which all require
CYP17A1 - the pharmacologic target of abiraterone. No biochemical pathway of androgen synthesis is
known to circumvent this requirement for CYP17A1. Further, all pathways for the synthesis of
testosterone (T) and/or DHT require 3βHSD enzymatic activity. Clinical data from > 800 patients showing
that a genetically hyperactive form of 3βHSD1 is associated with resistance to CYP17A1 inhibition led us to
pursue the possibility that a CYP17A1-independent pathway exists that bypasses next-generation hormonal
therapy blockade. We have identified an oxysterol that prostate cancer uses as a substrate for androgen
generation via a pathway that is impervious to CYP17A1 inhibition. In contrast, this same pathway is
blocked by 3βHSD1 inhibition. Our further data suggest that 3βHSD1 phosphorylation is absolutely essential for
enzymatic activation. We propose to determine the role of alternative steroidogenesis pathways that utilize
3βHSD1, thus circumventing the requirement for CYP17A1 and enabling resistance to next-generation hormonal
therapies. We will determine the role of CYP17A1-independent androgen synthesis in next-generation anti-
androgen therapy resistance. Furthermore, we will identify and exploit phosphorylation sites that are required for
3βHSD1-dependent and CYP17A1-independent androgen synthesis. Impact: Prostate cancer is the second
leading cause of cancer death in U.S. men. Our studies will pave the way to mapping out an entirely new
biochemical pathway of androgen synthesis that will define a major mechanism of treatment resistance and new
targets for therapy. Our work is highly innovative because this pathway is entirely novel, and we will identify
precursor metabolites for androgen synthesis using an approach that, to our knowledge, has not previously been
utilized for this purpose."

Relapse to drug abuse is the single greatest challenge in addiction treatment. Relapse can occur even after
prolonged abstinence and is often preceded by robust drug craving precipitated by exposure to drug-paired
stimuli and environments. Aerobic exercise is a novel and promising behavioral treatment for drug addiction
and relapse. However, the precise mechanism of its therapeutic effects is unknown. The long-term goal of this
project is to characterize the striatal network dynamics that mediate the effects of exercise on addiction and
relapse. The current aims of this proposal are to examine the impact of chronic wheel running on rapid
subsecond dopamine release dynamics and dopamine terminal function as well as on the longitudinal
development of phasic dopamine signals that promote cocaine-seeking behavior and on the recruitment of cell-
type specific neural processing of cocaine seeking and cocaine-paired cues. It is hypothesized that chronic
wheel running will (1) attenuate cocaine-evoked subsecond dopamine release in the striatum, (2) decrease
striatal phasic dopaminergic signals accompanying cocaine-paired cues and cocaine seeking, and (3)
attenuate D1-MSN and potentiate D2-MSN encoding of cocaine-paired cues and cocaine seeking. These
experiments will employ a sophisticated mouse model of cocaine relapse, state-of-the-art in vivo fast-scan
cyclic voltammetry recordings, in vivo multiple single-unit electrophysiological recordings, and chemogenetic
and optogenetic technologies to examine these questions in behaving animals. The proposed experiments aim
to increase our understanding of the neurobiological substrates that mediate drug craving and relapse and
identify the neurochemical and neurophysiological mechanisms of the beneficial effects of exercise."
10769577,"The overall objective of the cardiovascular disease (CVD) epidemiology and prevention postdoctoral training
program at Northwestern University is to prepare academically-oriented MD and PhD trained investigators for
research-intensive careers in CVD epidemiology and prevention. This ongoing multidisciplinary research
training program is entering it’s 19th consecutive year and proposes to continue supporting 4 postdoctoral
trainees for a training period that is typically 2 years in duration. At the completion of training, our alumni will be
prepared for independent research careers in many sectors including academia, government and industry. We
will achieve these outcomes by advertising our training program openings and using a rigorous selection
process to identify promising candidates from a diversity of academic backgrounds (MD and PhDs from
methodologically rigorous graduate programs). In addition to academic diversity, we will continue our targeted
actions to attract candidates who have been traditionally underrepresented in science and medicine. Our
program will continue to provide training in epidemiology, prevention, biostatistics, nutrition, behavioral
medicine, vascular medicine, endocrinology, cardiovascular imaging, health services research, dissemination
and implementation and the study of molecular mechanisms of disease (including ‘-omics). The home for the
training program is the resource-rich environment at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.
The department where the program is housed, is home to multiple cohort studies that include persons across
the lifecourse and capture a breadth of cardiovascular outcomes. Program faculty are well-funded and highly
research active. As a result, there are additional opportunities for trainees to participate in data collection and
the implementation of rigor and reproducibility in study design and analysis. Trainees will work with their
mentors to identify SMART (Specific, Measurable, Action-Oriented, Realistic and Time-Bound) training goals in
their individual career advancement plan (ICAP). These goals and plan for training to achieve them is based on
the program competencies in knowledge, skills and professional growth. The ICAP is reviewed and updated
quarterly and feedback is provided by the trainees’ mentoring committee which is comprised of at least 2
program mentors. The centerpiece of the training program is trainee engagement in mentored research
projects that yield scientific products such as manuscripts and presentations for dissemination to the scientific
community and lay community (whenever applicable). The Program Director, Associate Director and mentors
are a highly experienced team who has worked together for many years. The program administration is
supported by an administrative infrastructure that provides input on the program vision and mission, selection
of trainees and curriculum. Ongoing evaluation allows for programmatic modifications in order to maximize the
effectiveness of the program."
10770413,"A central problem in ovarian cancer is late diagnosis, which causes the 5-year survival rate to plummet
below 50%. Ovarian cancer symptoms are vague and nonspecific, and current screening is generally not
effective. Because ovarian cancer is so deadly, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is often
recommended for women at high risk; however, RRSO has fertility and health consequences. It is now
believed that ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) may begin in the fallopian tubes (FTs) as serous
tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), and that precancerous changes are detectable before metastasis to the
ovary and peritoneal cavity occurs. Our preliminary data indicate that there are significant changes in serum
protein biomarkers in HGSC cases 12-84 months prior to diagnosis. Further, we have also shown that changes
occur in multispectral fluorescence image markers of normal and cancerous ovaries and FTs, and that we can
build a thin falloposcope suitable for traversing the uterus and FT for imaging and cell collection.
 We will address the unmet clinical need for a minimally invasive test for STIC and early (stage I/II) ovarian
cancer. Currently, no methods enable the detection of ovarian HGSC with a lead time of more than 12 months.
Overall, our work will meet the need to detect aggressive cancers at the earliest possible stage. Our initial
target population is women at high risk for ovarian cancer who wish to delay or avoid RRSO. We will combine
blood screening for protein markers with a minimally invasive falloposcopy for optical imaging and FT cell
collection. Our procedure will be tested in a study of women at high risk undergoing bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy with hysterectomy, which will enable us to obtain and compare test results to gold standard
histology. The specific aims are to:
 1) Develop and validate biomarkers that detect STIC and early epithelial ovarian cancer. We will improve
upon our existing cut-off based algorithm with newly-discovered markers as well develop a velocity-based
biomarker algorithm. The algorithm that detects disease 12-84 months prior to diagnosis will be confirmed in
an independent, blinded set of clinical blood samples.
 2) Develop endoscopic imaging and pathomics markers. We will improve our prototype falloposcope
system with higher resolution multispectral imaging and improved cell collection ability. We will develop
imaging and karyometric markers from the FT images and the cells collected, and perform a pilot in vivo study.

Mothers of preterm infants experience elevated stress compared to that typically associated with new mother-
hood. Indeed, up to 70% of mothers of preterm infants experience postpartum depression compared to 12.5%
of those delivering term infants. This is important because mental stress in women is linked with poor maternal
and infant health as well as (in breastfeeding women) altered circulating levels of bioactive proteins that can
transfer into milk. This project will use rigorous approaches to generate new scientific knowledge with
the potential to improve clinical outcomes for breastfeeding mothers of preterm infants living in north-
ern Idaho, a region classified as being rural as well as ‘frontier and remote.’ Understanding modifiable
factors predisposing mothers of preterm infants to extreme stress and finding ways to lower this stress and
prevent its negative impacts on maternal and infant health are important public health challenges. Serum vita-
min D concentration is inversely correlated with risk of postpartum depression in women delivering term in-
fants, yet interventions with vitamin D supplements have yielded inconsistent results. In addition, there have
been no vitamin D intervention studies in mothers of preterm infants. There is a critical need to determine ways
to lower stress, response to it, and/or depression in the vulnerable population of mothers of preterm infants.
Our long-term goal is to develop interventions to improve maternal and infant health – particularly in the con-
text of preterm births. The primary objective of this proposal is to determine if maternal vitamin D supplementa-
tion improves mental health in mothers of preterm infants living in the Idaho panhandle. Secondarily, we will
assess the impact of supplementation on human milk composition. Our central hypotheses are that 1) vitamin
D supplementation improves mental health in women delivering prematurely; and 2) vitamin D supplementation
beneficially modifies human milk vitamin D and immunomodulatory composition. We will test our hypotheses
through a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with 120 mothers of preterm in-
fants. Mothers will be randomized to consume either a placebo control (corn oil supplement) or vitamin D sup-
plements (2,000 IU/day vitamin D3). Maternal stress and depression will be assessed by measuring sali-
vary/milk cortisol and oxytocin as well as administering validated stress, depression, and self-compassion
questionnaires. Vitamin D status will be assessed using serum vitamin D concentration, dietary intake ques-
tionnaires, and concentration of vitamin D in milk. Holistic milk composition will be assessed by proteomics and
targeted protein analyses. This study is significant and innovative because it will, for the first time, document
the effects of vitamin D supplementation on stress, depression, and milk composition in mothers of preterm
infants. Should our hypotheses be supported, this research will improve clinical care for mothers of preterm
infants in Idaho, other rural Western states, and possibly other regions. If findings are replicated in mothers of
term infants, our results may also extend to this broader neonatal population."

Worldwide, the prevalence of diabetes is increasing, largely due to increasing occurrence of overweight and
obesity. Approximately 10.5% of the US population has diabetes, and this rate is higher among women and
some racial/ethnic minorities, including Hispanics (17%). Hispanic women experience higher proportional risks
of mortality and complications from diabetes compared to Hispanic men. Hispanic diabetes disparities are
mainly attributed to limited access to healthy foods and poor access to healthcare; however, factors increasing
diabetes risk in Hispanic women are complex and not fully understood. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or
delayed through lifestyle changes that include weight loss and greater physical activity. Our long-term goal is to
improve women’s health through developing effective health promotion and disease treatments related to nutri-
tion and lifestyle. The primary goal of the research proposed here is to understand the complex intersec-
tions of nutrition, gender roles, ethnicity, and mental health as they relate to the development of diabe-
tes and treatment-seeking behaviors among Hispanic women living in Idaho. Idaho women are at ele-
vated risk for many poor health outcomes because large portions of the state are rural and are categorized as
‘remote and frontier.’ These regions are sparsely populated and have limited access to basic goods and ser-
vices – including grocery stores and health care. We will use a novel, intersectional, mixed-methods experi-
mental design that acknowledges systematic discrimination due to interwoven identity-based characteristics,
such as gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, immigration status, socio-economic status, and disability, which
create overlapping barriers to opportunity, resulting in poor nutrition and inadequate healthcare access. This
intersectional mixed-methods study includes 1) an online survey to identify associations between type 2 diabe-
tes control and dietary intake, food security, physical activity, selfcare, caregiving, medication use, and expo-
sure to stress and discrimination among Hispanic Idahoans; 2) qualitative interviews documenting women’s
self-expressed life stories that may capture experiences contributing to development of type 2 diabetes; and 3)
statistical testing of the final intersectional model that integrates associations between type 2 diabetes in His-
panic women and their nutritional, physical, mental, and socio-emotional health. This research is significant
and novel because it will use, for the first time, an intersectional mixed-methods approach to understand nutri-
tional, physical, mental, caregiving, and socio-emotional factors contributing to the development of diabetes
among Hispanic women living in Idaho. The results from this study will identify areas for interventions to im-
prove diabetes control and prevention programs. Also, the innovative intersectional mixed-model method may
be applied to further understanding diabetes development and progression, and even more broadly to other
nutrition-related chronic health concerns for women, Idahoans, and the nation."

The goal of the annual Jackson Laboratory Short Course on Experimental Models of Human Cancer is to train
graduate students, postdocs, and junior investigators in the basic science and application of experimental models
of human cancer. The training program will immerse participants and faculty in a unique and highly integrated
scientific environment and empower the next generation of scientists tackling human cancer. The integrated
program will cover advances in three critical areas: experimental cancer models, modern technology to assess
mechanisms and outcomes, and the interplay of the tumor and host genetics as well as tumor microenvironment
and the immune system. It will teach classical approaches to mouse and human genetics, modern molecular
genetic methodologies, computational and bioinformatics concepts, ontological standards, and scientific and
medical ethics. Trainees will participate in lectures, workshops, multi-disciplinary scientific debates, networking
and career development sessions, and poster sessions. They will receive practical training in bioinformatics,
statistical genetics, and the use and analysis of PDX models. This course will take place at The Jackson
Laboratory (JAX), which hosts an NCI-designated Basic Laboratory Cancer Center and is a global resource of
mouse models. The proposed 8-day intensive, immersion course focused on graduate students, postdocs, and
new investigators will promote active interaction and networking between the participants as well as with the
outstanding cadre of lecturers and trainers. Additionally, the Short Course will be delivered in a hybrid format,
with online/virtual access to the seminars and, where practical and feasible, the workshops: this was successfully
piloted in 2022. The hybrid format enhances inclusivity by reducing barriers to participation for individuals who
could not otherwise attend. JAX is deeply committed to training a diverse group of biomedical scientists and we
will continue to promote diversity in both the recruitment of participants and in the tools being generated to study
cancer. Diverse attendees will be actively recruited, scholarships will be provided to enable in-person
attendance, and an inclusive virtual option will enable participation by those that are unable to travel. Diversity
will also be emphasized in the context of best practices for cancer research to address ongoing health care
disparities, the need for studies of genetically diverse models, and representation of diverse backgrounds within
genetic databases and samples."

Substance use—including substance misuse and use disorders—and chronic pain are very
common conditions in the US and constitute an important public health problem. Substance use
and chronic pain commonly co-occur, are highly interrelated, and often disproportionately
impact marginalized communities. Given the degree of interconnectedness between substance
use and chronic pain, addressing these conditions together is an important opportunity to
improve outcomes for both. At the same time, impactful scientific inquiry is best accomplished
by interdisciplinary and diverse teams; therefore, there is an urgent need for research teams to
become more diverse. The mission of this new NIDA T32 training program entitled “BUilding an
InterprofessionaL and Diverse workforce in substance Use and Pain” (BUILD-UP) will be to
provide personalized and rigorous training to postdoctoral fellows who plan careers at the
intersection of substance use and chronic pain. BUILD-UP’s mission includes prioritizing
recruitment of postdoctoral fellows from diverse backgrounds, including people who identify as
being from a group excluded based on ethnicity and race, being from a disadvantaged
background, having a disability, or being LGBT+, and will also recruit individuals from a variety
of training backgrounds. Once enrolled, BUILD-UP fellows will be mentored on a longitudinal
research project by experts in the field from the University of Pittsburgh, a hub for research at
the intersection of substance use and pain; participate in a rigorous, comprehensive curriculum
based on core clinical and translational science competencies that includes tailored career
development sessions, the option to complete a Master’s of Science in Clinical Research, and
seminars on pain and substance use-related topics. Fellows will come together in person for
annual retreats, in-person conferences, and short-term research experiences. A critical and
innovative aspect of BUILD-UP is that the majority of this 3-year training program will be
conducted remotely, as a means to promote equity by reducing the barriers presented by having
fellows move to a research hub. There are few training programs at the intersection of
substance use and chronic pain, and even fewer remote postdoctoral fellowship options. In
addition to being novel within this field, this program can serve as a model training program for
others who wish to create a diverse workforce and build capacity for equitable research training
not only at major hubs, but throughout the US."

We seek to continue a postdoctoral research training program for anesthesiologists, now in its 45th
year, in order to develop skilled physician-scientists who will expand knowledge and ultimately improve
clinical delivery of patient care in core practice areas of anesthesiology: perioperative medicine, critical
care, perinatal care, and pain management. We propose to offer ten carefully selected
anesthesiologists the opportunity to train with an outstanding investigator-mentor in one of the research
programs at the Harvard Medical School or its affiliated institutes and hospitals, for a period of 2 or 3
years. A national pool of candidates is recruited, with Harvard-affiliated academic anesthesiology
programs providing an enriched source of highly capable and motivated residents and fellows. Special
efforts are made to establish and maintain diversity through recruitment and retention of individuals
from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, disabled individuals, and those from disadvantaged
backgrounds. The training program is structured as a tutorial, individualized to meet the specific needs
and research interests of each trainee. Research areas include, but are not limited to: biochemistry,
bioengineering, biophysics, clinical outcomes, endocrinology, epidemiology, genetics, immunology,
metabolism, molecular biology, neurobiology, nutrition, pharmacology, physiology, and toxicology. To
best match the needs of trainees, faculty mentors are selected or recruited, based on their expertise
and experience, funding record, and demonstrated ability to help mentees succeed in achieving
research independence, including independent extramural support. Trainees will also undertake
course-work tailored to their individual experience, needs, and goals, which may include the completion
of graduate certificates or degrees. Training in responsible conduct of research and research rigor will
be required. The program’s long-term goal is to increase the number of anesthesiologists with the
knowledge, skills, and determination to become independent researchers focused on questions of
importance to anesthesiology and the basic sciences upon which it rests. The participating Harvard-
affiliated academic anesthesiology departments, in which trainees will hold clinical appointments, are
committed to their long-term career development beyond completion of this program. These trainees
are expected to enrich the next generation of research leaders and mentors, as the needs of patients
evolve and the medical discipline of anesthesiology optimally responds."

Biomaterial scaffolds represent a promising approach for material-based tissue regeneration. We previously
developed microporous annealed particle (MAP) hydrogels - a flowable, microparticle-based hydrogel in which
neighboring hydrogel particles are linked in situ to form a porous scaffold that accelerates wound healing.
Recently, we found that a relatively simple modification to the crosslinker peptide from L-enantiomer to D-
enantiomer resulted in substantial skin regeneration and that this regeneration only occurs when the adaptive
immune system is intact. Further investigation revealed that although D-chiral peptides were poor activators of
macrophage innate immune signaling, D-chiral peptides within MAP (D-MAP) elicited significant antigen-specific
immunity. In this proposal, we will further investigate the ability of our D-MAP material to activate the adaptive
immune system and lead to skin tissue regeneration. Aim 1 will focus on further understanding any role of the
innate immune system and the ability of MAP scaffold microstructure to dictate macrophage phenotype. Aim 2
will focus on testing our hypothesis that the adaptive immune system is activated by our material and leads to
regenerative wound healing. Aim 3 will investigate other biomaterial approaches to present D-peptides and
further control immune system activation."

A century of research has shown that the adult central nervous system is incapable of self-repair after injury or
disease. Indeed, adults with traumatic spinal cord injuries maintain chronic functional deficits that impact all
aspects of their lives. However, increasing evidence suggests that the adult CNS retains some ability to initiate
a growth program and functionally re-organize in response to activity, experience and mild trauma and
particularly after intensive rehabilitative therapy. In this proposal we have used in vivo viral tracing in
combination with FACS and single cell RNA sequencing to develop a comprehensive anatomical and
molecular atlas of the adult corticospinal tract (CST). We plan to leverage this atlas to define the molecular
mechanisms that drive axon growth in specific subsets of corticospinal tract neurons during rehab in the

understanding of the intrinsic molecular mechanism that initiates and sustains rehab-mediated axon growth
within defined subsets of CST neurons can then be exploited to design novel therapies to repair the acutely
and chronically damaged spinal cord."
10881965,"Current antiretroviral therapies (ART) are successful in suppressing HIV-1 replication in most individuals.
However, cessation of ART results in emergence of HIV-1 from a latent viral reservoir, thereby requiring a
lifetime ART regime. The best-described HIV-1 reservoir is that of CD4+ T lymphocytes in circulating blood
and lymphoid tissues that contain a transcriptionally silent but replication-competent virus. The brain is also an
important viral reservoir site, but it is poorly characterized due to the challenges in obtaining specimens for
analyses. Despite its effectiveness, multiple toxicities are associated with ART, especially the high prevalence
of HIV-associated neurocognitive deficits. The research described in this application will use human autopsy
specimens to investigate two key issues regarding HIV-1 infection of the brain: 1) epigenetic mechanisms that
regulate active and latent HIV-1 infection in the brain; 2) mechanisms underlying neuropathogenesis and
neurocognitive deficits in HIV-1-infected individuals on suppressive ART. Brain specimens from prefrontal
cortex and hippocampus from HIV-1 infected individuals treated with ART death will be obtained from the
National NeuroAIDS Consortium. Matched HIV-1-negative control specimens will be obtained from the
UTHealth Brain Collection. Single cell RNA sequencing technology will be utilized to identify long noncoding
RNAs (lncRNAs), mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs) that are dysregulated in HIV-1-infected individuals.
Validation experiments will be performed in HIV-1-infected microglia cells to identify dysregulated lncRNAs and
miRNAs that contribute to HIV-1 replication, latency, and neuropathogenesis. Completion of the proposed
work is likely to identify therapeutic approaches to treat HIV-1 infection of the brain."
10806198,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Poor muscle function is a pressing public health problem: half of all U.S. older adults meet criteria for muscle
weakness. Poor muscle function, defined by low muscle strength and power, is a major risk factor for a host of
negative health outcomes, including functional limitations, disability and multimorbidity. Neighborhood
characteristics predict functional limitations, disability and death, but the biologic mechanisms are poorly
understood. Muscle function and its underlying physiology, including mitochondrial bioenergetics, are a
biologically promising, but unexplored mechanism linking neighborhoods and disability. While previous
research has examined neighborhood effects on disability, almost no prior work has explored neighborhood
effects on muscle function and no research has evaluated connections with skeletal muscle mitochondria.
Neighborhood factors represent an untapped opportunity in musculoskeletal health research directly aligned
with NIA's strategic goals to “assess the interplay among environmental, sociocultural, behavioral, and
biological determinants to understand and prevent disease” while “exploring the relationship among
mitochondrial biogenesis and musculoskeletal function”. Understanding how neighborhood characteristics get
`under the skin' and contribute to poor muscle function, reduced physical activity, and alter mitochondrial
bioenergetics will enhance our understanding of what social and biologic risk factors matter most for muscle
function and could be targets for interventions.
This study proposal leverages data from two well-characterized datasets, the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS) and the Study of Muscle Mobility and Aging (SOMMA) to identify which features of the neighborhood
environment are related to muscle function, physical activity and mitochondrial health in older adults. This
proposal seeks to: (1) assess which predictors of the neighborhood environment affect muscle function in older
adults; (2) examine the relationship between the neighborhood environment and skeletal muscle mitochondrial
bioenergetics, and; (3) test the hypothesis that mitochondrial bioenergetics and physical activity mediate the
link between the neighborhood environment and muscle function.
Complementing this research, a detailed training plan, carried out at the University of California, San
Francisco, will build on the applicant's prior training in social and clinical epidemiology to include (1)
neighborhood research on planning/design; (2) the assessment of skeletal muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics,
and; (3) causal mediation analysis. This integrated sociobiologic training will prepare the applicant for a
successful independent research career focused on incorporating the social determinants of health into the
study of musculoskeletal research. Findings from this proposal will provide critical insights into understanding
the complex, multifactorial social and biologic contributors of poor muscle function in older adults."
10784609,"The highly orchestrated muscle activation sequences during motor behaviors are achieved directly through the
fine-tuned firing of motor neurons in the ventral spinal cord. These motor neurons are mainly regulated by spinal
interneurons present in all mammals, which are, in turn, connected to other spinal neurons as well as various
types of descending neurons from the brain, such as corticospinal (CS), reticulospinal and rubrospinal neurons.
Until recently, the identities and functioning of the interneuron subtypes and descending neurons participating in
individual circuits had remained elusive. What remains lacking is knowledge of the arrangement and functional
role of the spinal interneuron subtypes in individual circuits. There is, therefore, a critical need to determine the
anatomical and functional connectivity of these spinal interneuron subtypes and how they regulate motor
behaviors. Our overall objectives in this application are to (i) map anatomical and functional connectivity of
different classes of spinal interneurons (Aims 1 & 2), and (ii) elucidate how those interneurons effect motor
behaviors (Aim 3). Our central hypothesis is that each interneuron subtype will exhibit preferential connections
with distinct descending neurons to control discrete forms of locomotor and skilled movements."
10784610,"ABSTRACT
Severe forms of congenital heart disease such as transposition of the great arteries (TGA) are common birth
defects. Outcomes for TGA have significantly improved with restoration of normal cardiovascular physiology
after the newborn operation. Despite this, children with TGA experience significant neurodevelopmental (ND)
impairments across the lifespan suggesting that prenatal and neonatal physiology may have a lasting impact
on ND outcome. Newborns with TGA are known to have delayed brain development beginning in utero and are
at increased risk for acquired neonatal white matter injury (WMI) with the majority observed before the
neonatal operation. These observations and our preliminary data suggest that circulatory adjustments during
perinatal transition from fetal to neonatal life may play a significant role in the susceptibility to WMI after birth.
Perinatal transition is a key time period with potential for neuroprotective interventions such as delayed cord
clamping, which has been demonstrated to provide neuroprotection to term and preterm newborns. In this
proposal, we aim to fill a significant gap in our field related to how physiologic changes in cardiovascular and
cerebral hemodynamics during perinatal transition affect brain health in patients with TGA. Our two centers’
experience with fetal and neonatal neuroimaging and neuromonitoring, uniquely positions us to take a
longitudinal approach beginning in fetal life to first identify a prenatal biomarker of poor brain maturation and
second to examine the impact of transitional physiology on acquired neonatal WMI. We will test the
hypotheses that decreased cerebral tissue oxygenation in utero predisposes to brain immaturity, that the
resulting immaturity increases susceptibility to acquired neonatal WMI due to perinatal circulatory features of
TGA, and that this could be modified by improving perinatal cerebral oxygen delivery through delayed cord
clamping. Our long term goals are to use data from this proposal to design neuroprotective trials focused on
the transitional time period that have the potential to optimize ND outcomes in this patient population."

Mutations in CaV2.1 pore-forming 1A subunit cause a spectrum of neurological diseases including epileptic
encephalopathies (EE), familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1), episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), spinocerebellar
ataxia type 6 (SCA6), and intellectual disability (ID). The ClinVar database has entries for >1000 CACNA1A
mutations most of which (437) are classified as variants of unknown significance (VUS), pathogenic (137), or
likely pathogenic (61). There are several challenges for efforts to develop effective therapies for CACNA1A
channelopathies: 1) the large number of dmutations that give rise to disease make it unclear whether common
therapies can be found; 2) the full scope of functional alterations due to individual mutations and how these relate
to disease etiology are ambiguous; and 3) lack of novel therapeutics targeted to CaV2.1 functional deficiencies.
We hypothesize that the hundreds of distinct CACNA1A mutations fall into a few discrete functional groups that
can be targeted by novel bioengineered molecules tailored for each class. Our long-term objective is to gain an
in-depth perspective on how distinct CACNA1A mutations give rise to a spectrum of neurological disorders and
to develop molecules that can address the functional deficits as potential therapeutics. Here, we propose an
inter-disciplinary, multi-level proposal spanning single-channel and whole-cell Ca2+ channel biophysics, patient-
specific induced pluripotent stem cell neurons (hiPSC-neurons), mouse models of CACNA1A neurological
disease, and development of corrective molecules. The breadth of the proposal is enabled by collaboration and
combining resources between two labs− the Colecraft lab (Columbia University) has strong expertise in
molecular physiology and biophysics of CaV channels and developing innovative tools to regulate their functional
expression; the Rossignol lab (Montreal University) has expertise in generation and functional characterization
of CACNA1A mouse models of neurological disease. Dr. Rossignol is a clinician-scientist with a cohort of
CACNA1A patients who thus also brings a clinician’s perspective to the project. We propose three Aims all of
which are supported by strong preliminary data. 1) Determine holistic functional impact of distinct CACNA1A
mutations on recombinant CaV2.1 channels, and develop tailored approaches to correct different classes of
mutations. 2) Develop human ipsc-neurons to model and elucidate mechanisms of CACNA1A channelopathies
and to evaluate efficacy of novel potential therapeutic molecules. 3) Utilize mouse models to determine
mechanisms of disease and evaluate efficacy of novel tailored approaches to treat disease."
10771936,"The complex relationship of cone photoreceptor cells with retinal circuits, Müller glia, and retinal pigment
epithelial (RPE) cells is essential to normal vision. Yet for the cones in the very center of the fovea that mediate
peak visual acuity these relationships are poorly characterized. A longstanding barrier to a comprehensive
understanding of cellular and subcellular foveal structure is the myriad interactions among a great diversity of
cell types embedded and miniaturized within a complex three-dimensional architecture. The broad long-term
objective of this new research program is to elucidate foveal microstructure directly by application of new
methods of volume electron microscopy (connectomics). We will utilize retinal tissue acquired from an
innovative organ donor program that will permit pre-recovery optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to
assess retinal health status and foveal pit morphology and to guide connectomic reconstruction. Preliminary
data from two donor eyes demonstrates feasibility of complete reconstructions of foveal cones and their
associated synaptic pathways, Müller cells, and RPE cells. The first reconstructions of cone microcircuits from
an adult born preterm indicate that the critical cells and synaptic pathways for foveal vision differ dramatically in
structure and localization anticipated from previous work on non-human primates. Therefore in Aim 1 we
propose to localize, identify and reconstruct quantitatively the synaptic visual pathways that arise from
the central-most foveal cones. We will characterize all of the bipolar and ganglion cell circuits arising from
these cones and test the new hypothesis that the dominant “midget” pathway subserving spatial acuity may be
highly variable across individuals in both circuitry and pit localization. We will further test the hypothesis that
beyond the midget circuit the foveal center gives rise to over twenty distinct but as yet uncharacterized visual
pathways. The first reconstructions of Müller cells revealed the intimate wrapping of cone axons and
abundance of processes in the plexiform layer and foveal floor. In Aim 2 we propose complete
reconstructions of Müller cells to test the hypotheses that the foveal floor contains a novel Müller cell type
restricted to inner retina and that morphology of individual Müller cells and their foveal distribution accounts for
the macular pigment distribution. The first reconstructions of RPE cells provided new insights on the
distribution of organelles important in clinical OCT and autofluorescence imaging. Therefore, in Aim 3 we
propose to reconstruct and enumerate organelles in RPE cells in the cone-only fovea and the mixed
rod-cone perifovea. We will directly test the hypothesis that RPE organelle content and distribution differs
between cone-only fovea and rod-rich perifovea, accounting for the appearance of OCT bands and for
topography of autofluorescence signal in clinical imaging. This proposal combines expertise and innovation in
neurobiology, pathology, imaging, and connectomics. Outcomes will impact retinal neurobiology, clinical image
interpretation, and pathophysiology of macular diseases, especially age-related macular degeneration."
10771937,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application is an ancillary study to the NASH Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) which has
conducted several important clinical studies including landmark clinical trials. However, the studies conducted
by the NASH CRN have systematically excluded individuals with HIV infection as their liver disease is thought
to be distinct from general population due to ongoing HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy, and concomitant
medications and recurrent infections. This exclusion of HIV infected persons led to a large knowledge gap
related to fatty liver disease in this population. Recent cross-sectional studies have shown that there is high
prevalence of fatty liver disease in HIV infected adults and importantly their risk for advanced fibrosis may be
significantly higher than the general population. In order to address the critical knowledge gaps plaguing the
field of NAFLD and NASH in HIV, we are proposing the following broad specific aims in our R01 application in
response to the PAR-18-042. Specific Aim 1: To examine the prevalence of hepatic steatosis in a cross-
sectional study on large cohort of HIV infected individuals. This cross-sectional study will identify both non-
genetic and genetic risk factors associated with hepatic steatosis in HIV infected individuals. A robust biobank
consisting of plasma, serum, genomic DNA, PBMC, stool and urine will be established. All participants will
have (a) liver biochemistries; (b) VCTE; and (c) plasma and genomic DNA collected. Specific Aim 2: To
conduct a prospective observational study of 400 HIV infected individuals with histologically characterized
NAFLD. Participants in this HIV-NAFLD cohort will be compared to non-HIV infected individuals with NAFLD in
the ongoing NASH CRN adult database 2 (DB2) studies for baseline clinical characteristics and demographic,
anthropometric, metabolic and cardiovascular risks. Participants will be followed longitudinally on an annual
basis according to a scheduling mimicking the DB2 protocol. Specific Aim 3: To carefully characterize liver
histology in HIV infected individuals with biopsy proven NAFLD. Key objectives of this aim are (a) to validate
the widely used NASH CRN histological scoring system and European SAF scoring systems in population of
persons with both HIV and NAFLD and (b) to assess histological similarities and dissimilarities in liver histology
between HIV infected and non-infected individuals with NAFLD. NASH CRN Pathology Subcommittee will
review liver biopsies from HIV infected individuals. Specific Aim 4: To conduct a multicenter, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of a novel PPARα/γ agonist in 160 HIV infected individuals with
biopsy proven NASH. Primary end point will be resolution of NASH with key secondary endpoints being (a)
improvement in NAS by 2 points; (b) improvement in fibrosis; (c) improvement in aminotransferases; (d)
improvement in cardiovascular risks; and (e) safety and tolerability."
10771943,"Abstract:
Although often overlooked as a significant health problem, pulmonary infections with fungal pathogens present
a clinical problem of growing concern. Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) and Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) are two
clinically important fungal pathogens that affect immunosuppressed patients worldwide. Both infections are
difficult to treat and are associated with high mortality rates. A better understanding of immune mechanisms of
host defense against fungi hold the promise of providing the basis for the future development of novel, immune
based interventions to improve patient outcomes. Pulmonary macrophages are critical, front-line mediators of
host protection against fungi and other pulmonary pathogens. Despite the well-defined role of lung macrophages
as crucial initiators of immunity to diverse sets of pathogens, our understanding of how previous infection history
shapes subsequent macrophage responses to fungal infection in the lung remain poorly defined. Moreover, an
emerging body of literature has now revealed that macrophage populations in the lung are more heterogeneous
than originally appreciated and can undergo innate training; an enhanced response to diverse secondary
challenges. It is now also understood that alveolar macrophages present in the lung can originate from embryonic
precursors (tissue-derived alveolar macrophages-TD-AMs) or from blood monocytes (monocyte-derived alveolar
macrophages-Mo-AMs). Whether TD-AM and Mo-AM are equally capable of undergoing innate training is
currently unclear. It is also unknown whether innate training is a conserved response to any infectious stimuli or
regulated by specific pathways. In preliminary studies, we uncovered that priming with an immunogenic strain of
Cn (HK-fbp1) could confer heterologous protection against infection with Af even in the context of drug-induced
immunosuppression and in a T cell-independent manner. Preliminary data gathered, suggest that neutrophils
and STAT1-dependent signals are important regulators of antifungal monocytes and their differentiation into
monocyte-derived cells. Based on our aggregate observations, the central hypothesis of this project is that:
CCR2+mo are critical mediators of antifungal immunity and can be instructed by HK-fbp1 into trained mo-AM via
the coordinated actions of neutrophils and an interferon (IFN) cascade. We will address two related but
independent aims: Aim 1: Investigate the impact of HK-fbp1 immunization to pulmonary innate cell priming and
training to promote antifungal immunity; Aim 2: Decipher the contributions of neutrophils in the regulation of
antifungal trained immunity."
10771944,"Summary and Abstract
HCC is one of the most common cancers worldwide, accounting for an estimated 600,000 deaths annually.
The incidence of HCC has increased in the United States over the past 25 years and the incidence of and
mortality rate for HCC are expected to double over the next 10 to 20 years. The increased incidence rate
is exacerbated by high mortality rate of HCC. The overall five-year survival rates of patients with HCC in
the United States are around 16%, making HCC the most lethal cancer type after pancreatic cancer.
Despite its importance, HCC is understudied compared to other major lethal cancers, and hence, our
knowledge of the genetic or epigenetic alterations associated with the initiation, progression, and clinical
outcomes of HCC is still fragmentary. Furthermore, there is only a limited arsenal of treatment options for
HCC as less than one-third of patients with HCC are eligible for potentially curative treatments such as
resection, transplantation, or percutaneous ablation. Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic
and anti-proliferative effects, has been shown to improve survival in these patients, and has become the
standard of care in advanced HCC. However, unfortunately, benefit of sorafenib treatment appears to be
marginal extending only 2.8 months of overall survival and a dismal response rate of only 2%, highlighting
the urgent need for new targeted agents or finding new ways to overcome resistant to sorafenib.
 By analyzing proteomic and genomic data from human HCC, we uncovered three molecularly and
clinically distinct proteomic subtype of HCC. Analysis with integrated proteomic data with genomic data
further showed that PEA15 is highly amplified in HCC genome and its amplification and expression are
significantly associated with poor prognosis. Its amplification is not limited to HCC as amplified in bladder
cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer. We demonstrated that PEA15 is up-regulated in vast majority of
HCC cell lines and it is essential for proliferation and survival of HCC cells. We further demonstrated that
PEA15 promotes invasion of cancer. Our study also showed HCC cells with high PEA15 expression is
accountable for angiogenesis.
 In proposed study, we aim to (1) determine roles of PEA15 in HCC developments. (2) determine
roles of PEA15 in angiogenesis. (3) determine if PEA15 is good therapeutic targets for treatment of
HCC. If successful, this will open up new opportunity for development of novel therapeutic approaches for
poor prognostic patients with HCC. Furthermore, knowledge obtained from this study can be used in other
cancer type (i.e. bladder cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer) in which PEA15 is highly amplified and
associated with survival."

We propose that early endosomes function as a nexus between mitochondria and plasma membrane to
regulate a wide variety of cellular processes including receptor-mediated endosomal trafficking, signaling and
iron homeostasis. Determining how endosomal alterations on a subcellular level affect specific cancer-related
cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness is the focus of this research proposal.
Here, we will test the hypothesis that alterations in the early endosomal pathway can modify receptor-mediated
signaling as well as iron cellular homeostasis in a reciprocal manner to enhance the proliferative and survival
properties of cancer cells. We expect that the unravelling of the complex relationship between early
endosomes, mitochondria, iron and signaling and cancer progression will provide new tools for cancer therapy
and diagnosis. However, current approaches that investigate subcellular cancer cell biology of early
endosomal pathway on human breast cancer cells grown in 2D culture are not adequate to fully understand
how early endosomes can be re-programmed to support and enhance cancer cell proliferation, survival,
migration and/or invasiveness. Since 3D growth has been shown to affect organelle morphology, the analysis
of the morphology and function of organelles in 3D tumor systems is the new frontier of cancer cell biology.
Here, we will tackle this challenge by studying early endosomes, a complex and dynamic organelle, and their
interaction with mitochondria, in a comparative manner across 2D-culture cancer cell lines, 3D breast tumor
systems and human tumor frozen tissue sections. In summary, to advance our basic understanding of breast
cancer cell biology on a subcellular level, we will investigate the role of the morphology and function of early
endosomes and their interaction with mitochondria on the regulation of iron homeostasis and receptor-
mediated signaling pathways in 3D breast tumor systems."
10772158,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed team-based Medical Device Design and Innovation course will prepare undergraduate junior
and senior biomedical engineering students with a robust toolkit to be innovators of medical technologies with
the skills necessary to design devices that reduce medical errors and device failure hazards. A summer clinical
immersion, with a focus on identifying potential sources of preventable complications from medical device
adverse events and failures, will provide the students a widened perspective regarding the safe delivery of
healthcare. In addition, training during the semester long course in analyses of common causes of medical
device failure will provide the students the skills to develop devices responsibly.
The program will start in the summer with a clinical immersion for up to 10 students rotating through an 8-week
long rotation with Yale physicians and surgeons from 6 different specialties. Students will work with their
physician mentors to identify causes of preventable medical/surgical errors, device user-related hazards and
device failure hazards, with the goal of addressing these preventable complications with medical device design
projects. In addition, students will participate in didactics with a structured summer curriculum focusing on
needs identification, assessment and risk management.
In the Fall, the 10 summer students will continue their clinical immersions by shadowing 1 day a week, and
participate in a campus wide “device design speaker series”. Within the Spring semester course, each summer
Fellowship student will form the nucleus of a design team of 3-5 members. Based on needs / problems /
preventable medical errors identified within the summer and fall clinical immersion, the students, following the
biodesign innovation process, will design a functioning prototype and commercialization plan. Concurrently,
throughout the Spring semester, students will work on a separate failure analysis project to learn how to
pinpoint and simulate potential critical medical device failure mechanisms. Didactic lectures will include topics
such as the device design process, regulatory affairs, human factors engineering, responsible conduct of
research, and off-campus trips to medical device R&D facilities. At the end of the course, open access content
will be published as a free online curriculum, and students will submit papers to PubMed indexed journals.
The innovation of this application is to embed engineering students within a clinical environment, exposing
them to potential sources of preventable medical complications and device failures, as well as teaching them
how to identify, simulate and model critical failure mechanisms. This course, which seeks to attract
underrepresented minorities, will result in an improved pipeline of future scientists whose practical experience
in a clinical environment will facilitate their entry into biomedical engineering careers. The course will utilize the
engineering, innovation and medical research resources at Yale University. The University biomedical
engineering ecosystem will also benefit from collaboration between engineering faculty and clinicians."

Disruption of supraspinal regulation causes reduced sympathetic and unopposed parasympathetic activity,
leading to cardiac and hemodynamic disorders after high-level spinal cord injury (SCI). We recently reported that
renewal of serotonergic regulation over hemodynamics could be achieved with transplantation of embryonic
raphe nucleus-derived neural progenitors/stem cells (RN-NPCs) in a rat SCI model. It was previously showed
that exercise, a viable therapeutic intervention, heightens neuronal activity, axonal regrowth, and production of
neurotrophic factors after SCI. Accordingly, we posit that transplanting serotonergic NPCs in the injured spinal
cord will reestablish serotonin regulation to improve cardiac function, and combining RN-NPC grafts with
exercise will enhance the recovery of cardiac activity, hemodynamics, and autonomic dysreflexia after SCI. In
Aim 1, we will determine whether integration of transplanted serotonergic NPCs with spinal cord circuitry will
restore sympathetic regulation to improve cardiac electrical conduction following SCI. In Aim 2, we will test
whether combining RN-NPC transplants with exercise will further enhance the reconstitution of sympathetic
modulation to restore cardiac activity, hemodynamics, and autonomic dysreflexia. Overall, this project will
provide novel insight into therapeutic strategy following SCI."
10765053,"The overall goal of research in my lab is to deepen our understanding of the roles of post-transcriptional gene
regulation in the mammalian nervous system and how its dysregulation underlies human disease. In the next
five years, we will build upon our previous work on neuronal mRNA metabolism and translation control and
focus on three interconnected areas: 1} The impact of microsatellite repeat expansion on mRNA processing
and translation. We will conduct targeted and genome-wide analyses to systematically identify the cis-elements
and trans-factors that modulate noncanonical processing and translation of repeat-containing RNAs. 2} The
functions and regulation of alternative translation initiation. Through our in-depth investigation of a conserved
bi-functional mRNA that encodes two proteoforms of the neuronal pentraxin receptor (NPR}, we hope to
uncover general principles that will inform our understanding of the regulatory impact of alternative start codon
usage. 3} Quantitative measurement of mRNA translation efficiency (TE}. While ribosome footprint profiling, or
Ribo-seq, is widely used to measure TE at a transcriptome scale, our recent findings suggest that conventional
Ribo-seq procedures may not accurately capture the magnitude of TE regulation. By comparing Ribo-seq to
directly measure TE data and optimizing Ribo-seq procedures, we will reexamine fundamental questions about
translation control in mammalian cells. Results from these analyses may challenge existing dogmas and open
up new lines of investigations."

Experimentally induced animal models of disease play a critical role in the development, evaluation and
optimization of therapeutics for human disease. With the advent of genetic engineering, such model systems
have substantially improved; however, translational failure rates remain high for most disease entities. One
promising approach involves using pet dogs with spontaneous disease to evaluate treatment strategies for
diseases such as cancer, heart failure and neurodegeneration prior to human trials, with the goal of improving
clinical outcomes. Beyond their inherent biological relevance, translational advantages of this model include
longitudinal assessment of individual patients using diagnostics and interventions that parallel human processes,
compressed disease timelines that permit rapid evaluation of therapeutic impact, and the freedom to study
unique treatment combinations in lieu of standards of care. As human medicine progressively adopts strategies
designed to prevent disease progression through early detection and intervention, studies in pet dogs have the
potential to contribute valuable preclinical information. Several resources now support such work including the
NCI Integrated Canine Data Commons, SMART IACUC for multi-site studies, the CTSA One Health Alliance and
a markedly improved canine reference genome (CanFam4) and associated key omics tools. Despite these
advances, effective alignment and integration of data generated from pet dogs with human health systems
remains a substantial challenge. To begin addressing this gap, we developed a veterinary data model that is
harmonized with the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOPv5+ CDM) and
generated tools for core research infrastructure including, TRANSLATOR (TRanslational ANimal Shared
ColLAboraTive Observational Research). In the current application, we will build upon our prior work and
use pet dogs to develop, validate, and optimize tools for early disease detection, and in parallel, resource
these studies to iteratively advance methodologies for improving connectivity and application of such
data sets to human health processes. To accomplish this, we will 1) credential a liquid biopsy assay for early
detection of cancer relapse in pet dogs and rapidly test innovative strategies to prevent progression; 2) validate
an integrated ultrasound/exosome diagnostic for early detection of cardiac cachexia in pet dogs and assess
novel approaches to halt wasting; and 3) further enhance the utility of our OMOPv5+ CDM and related informatics
tools to realize the translational potential of pet dog trials. An outstanding team blending human and veterinary
medicine, comparative genomics, biomedical engineering, research informatics infrastructure and preclinical
translational modeling, supported by an advisory panel of human health experts, will facilitate successful
completion of stated milestones. Importantly, the proposed work integrates with and is supported by the parent
UM1, ensuring that scientific advancements for early disease detection and intervention co-evolve with
methodologies that improve fundamental processes necessary for interpretation and future utility of the science."

Scripps Research is becoming a leader in the field of translational research. This leadership establishes
itself on three strengths: the quality of its faculty, its outstanding and holistic training programs, and its
interdisciplinary culture. Ours is one of the few institutions in the US where a basic science idea can be
taken seamlessly to a drug candidate and a clinical trial. Reciprocally, we can also bring patients' data
or specimens from the clinic to the most basic aspects of science, including genomics, structural
biology, and chemistry. This translational ability requires early career scientists to be trained across
disciplines and in many emerging areas of data acquisition and processing. These areas include single
cell data acquisition, genomic studies, big data analysis, sophisticated biological measurements, and
animal models, and ultimately a deep knowledge of the disease being studied. In addition to this
interactive scientific multilayered education, our program benefits from our efforts to recruit, include,
retain, and support scientists from underrepresented gender, ethnic, and racial backgrounds.
Involvement in outreach initiatives towards underprivileged communities and patient-based
organizations is a mandatory requirement for our students. Advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion
(DEI) through curricula, training, and expanded recruitment partnerships, will be promoted by dedicated
T32 (one each from predoctoral and postdoctoral cohorts) DEI Liaisons. The DEI liaisons will
communicate directly with the Scripps Research Diversity Advisory Committee and will be involved in
recruitment activities. The probability of success of our efforts is enhanced by the integration of the
post-doctoral training program within the larger educational goals of the Scripps Research CTSA,
including interns, predoctoral students, and clinical research fellows. This mentee to mentor approach
is exemplified by the pairing of each T32 postdoctoral scholar with two T32 predoctoral scholars, and
a K12 scholar, and the T32 trainee summer supervision of interns from the SURF program. This aspect
of our training program will be enhanced by an already existing mentorship structure and an added
mentor training program. Our T32 funding will support three T32 postdoctoral trainees for 2-3 years
and will train them for a successful career in translational science and medicine. A particular emphasis
will be put on individual grant writing and submission to establish research independence. Translational
science coursework, created and directed by SRTI research team leaders, will incorporate protocol
design, literature review, ethical research practice, transdisciplinary teamwork, effective
communication, and advanced translational methodologies."
10766188,"Pneumonia causes adverse outcomes including hospitalization, intensive care, and death. Host response is
pivotal, with immune activities and cell dysfunctions responsible for pathophysiologies including but not limited
to excessive microbial growth, alveolar flooding, and septal destruction. Many diverse biological pathways can
lead to adverse outcomes within the infected lungs. A better understanding of the immunological and cellular
activities occurring inside severely infected lungs is needed, to distinguish sub-phenotypes of disease and
improve the development and application of host-directed therapies. In the proposed studies, we will leverage
large sets of post-mortem human pneumonic lung samples collected via rapid autopsy for defining pneumonia
sub-phenotypes based on their pulmonary pathobiology. We will integrate semi-quantitative histopathology
(scored by board-certified pathologists), quantitative multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry (mfIHC; to
enumerate and localize immune cells within these lungs), and single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq; to
broaden and deepen cell and molecular resolution of these lungs) in order to differentiate distinct lung
pathobiologies during pneumonia. In addition, we will examine multiple current and emergent experimental
models of severe pneumonia to determine which if any recapitulate elements of these pulmonary
pathobiologies. We propose to test the central hypothesis that severe pneumonias cluster into distinct
lung pathobiology sub-phenotypes, by pursuing the following specific aims: Aim 1) To test whether humans
dying with pneumonia segregate into lung pathology sub-phenotypes, using rapid autopsy samples analyzed
via histopathologic scoring and quantitative mfIHC. Aim 2) To validate and elucidate pneumonia sub-
phenotypes using an independent cohort with microscopy matched to snRNA-seq for defining cell-types and
cell-specific gene expression in infected human lungs. Aim 3) To test whether established and emerging
experimental models of severe pneumonia recapitulate some and which elements of human pulmonary
pathobiology. The proposed studies will be significant for generating discoveries from lung and blood samples
of pneumonia cases in elderly subjects, an especially high risk group for pneumonia. Proposed studies will
increase resolution into the heterogeneity of pneumonia, a currently pressing research priority. Results will
reveal whether sub-phenotypes or select features measured within the pneumonic lungs differ between
pneumonias caused by pneumococcus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Defining sub-types of pneumonia with
distinct molecular and cellular changes in the lungs will improve the development and use of host-directed
approaches for treating or preventing pneumonia."

modification, transcriptional regulation, mRNA splicing, processing, translation and degradation. Each of these
processes are regulated by nucleic acid-protein interactions (DNA-protein and RNA-protein). Accordingly, there
have been tremendous efforts in the scientific community to comprehensively map these interactions, including
major international research efforts (e.g. ENCODE, RoadMap Epigenomics) focused on generating reference
maps for specific cell types. However, because these binding maps are highly specific for individual cell types,
there is a critical need to enable the generation of comprehensive genomic maps for any cell type of interest –
including primary cell types, disease models, or other rare cell populations – within an individual lab. This goal
remains challenging because existing assays can only map interactions of a single protein at a time and are
therefore prohibitively expensive.
To address these issues, this proposal will develop a highly innovative technology based on our split-pool
barcoding strategy (SPRITE) that maps multiway protein-nucleic acid interactions using high throughput
sequencing. The proposed Hi-P technology will be used to establish: (i) a highly multiplexed eCLIP-seq method
to map up to hundreds of RNA binding proteins simultaneously to their RNA binding sites, (ii) a highly multiplexed
ChIP-seq method to map up to hundreds of DNA binding proteins and histone modifications to their DNA binding
sites, and (iii) methods to map these multiple protein-nucleic acid interactions across many samples, among
these rare cell types, simultaneously.
The proposed technology represents a major advance – it will dramatically increase the scale of existing methods
and create new capabilities that are currently not possible. These tools will empower individual researchers to
generate detailed genomic datasets in specific biological and disease contexts that are comparable in size and
complexity to those generated by the ENCODE project at a tiny fraction of its cost. More generally, we anticipate
that these tools will lead to critical new insights into gene regulation and human disease."

10757446,"BRCA1/2 mutation carriers have highly elevated odds of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, as
may their first- and second-degree relatives. The National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine’s
Genomics and Population Health Action Collaborative highlights the testing of carriers’ relatives and their uptake
of screening and risk-reducing surgeries as a primary way that genetics can contribute to the reduction of
population cancer burden. Patterns of testing over the past decade have shifted to include more younger and
cancer-unaffected women to capitalize on this cancer prevention opportunity. However, interventions have not
kept pace with this changing landscape, as there are currently no funded trials that meet the unique clinical,
developmental and psychological needs of young adult relatives (YARs) of mutation carriers. Our pilot data
suggests that YARs report high levels of distress and desire to seek HBOC risk information and emotional
support beyond their healthcare providers and families—especially support from knowledgeable peers who can
relate to their experiences and offer neutral grounding and objective guidance about coping strategies. Peer
support is a promising psychosocial cancer care approach that could fill this void. However, few evidence-based
standards inform its practice. In response to this cancer control challenge, we developed a new, fully
manualized/scripted intervention for YARs called “Peers and Cancer Empowerment” (PeACE). PeACE is
grounded in evidence-based psychosocial telephone counseling protocols for HBOC distress reduction. We
adapted those protocols for our target population through a systematic approach without contradicting their core
features. PeACE includes streamlined telephone counseling delivered by well-trained community peer coaches.
Session content incorporates coping training for HBOC stress reduction, and decision making and problem
solving training about confronting and managing cancer risk. We will rigorously test PeACE’s efficacy in an RCT
to improve HBOC-related outcomes for YARs. Trial participants are randomized to an intervention or equated
control condition, and followed for up to 12 months. We hypothesize that PeACE better reduces cancer-specific
and general distress, uncertainty, and decision conflict, as well as increased uptake of genetic counseling. This
innovative project expands capacity to address psychological distress management and related outcomes in
persons living with HBOC risk."

 This proposal centers on the role of the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) in mediating the
impact of early life adversity (ELA) on reward-seeking behaviors later in life. I will identify and characterize PVT
neuronal populations that are engaged by ELA, test the hypothesis that these neurons execute the enduring
effects of ELA on reward-seeking behaviors, and investigate a potential mechanism behind this process. Early
life adversity (ELA) consisting of factors such as poverty, trauma, or chaotic environment impacts the lives of
over 30% of children in the United States. ELA is associated with poor cognitive and emotional health and
increased risk for affective disorders, including depression, PTSD, and addiction, which involve aberrant reward-
circuit function. Studies in animals have demonstrated causal relations between ELA and impaired reward-
seeking behaviors and enable the establishment of underlying neurobiological mechanisms. It is crucial to
understand these associations, because ELA and its consequences, unlike genetic contributors to vulnerability
to psychopathologies, may be amenable to prevention or mitigation.
 The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is an important component of the reward circuit that
encodes remote emotionally-salient experiences to influence future reward-related behaviors. However, it
remains unknown if the PVT encodes experiences as remote as ELA and whether PVT neurons activated during
ELA contribute to deficits in reward-seeking behaviors later in life. Building on my robust preliminary data and a
potent validated naturalistic model of ELA in mice, which provokes deficits in reward-seeking behaviors later in
life, my central hypothesis states that PVT neuronal populations are activated during ELA and contribute to ELA-
provoked deficits in reward-seeking behaviors later in life. To test this hypothesis I will (a) capitalize on a
transgenic mouse for activity-dependent genetic labeling [Targeted Recombination in Active Populations
(TRAP2) mice] to determine the the location of neuronal populations within the PVT that are activated by ELA
and establish their molecular identity; (b) use chemogenetics to probe the role of PVT neurons activated during
ELA in governing reward behaviors later in life; (c) establish the differential PVT activation during reward-seeking
behaviors in adult ELA and control mice, with a potential role in the observed behavioral impairments. Together,
the proposed experiments will provide critical information about the developmental functions of the PVT and its
contributions to the impact of ELA on reward-seeking behaviors, significantly advancing our understanding of
the neurobiological mechanisms underlying reward-related psychopathologies."

To improve women’s and children’s health and make progress in addressing the U.N.’s Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs), there is a need to continue researching sustainable, cost-effective health
interventions and strengthening research infrastructure and public health intervention capabilities in
developing countries. The NICHD Global Network (GN) is critical to helping the U.S. government address the
SDGs to reduce maternal mortality and end preventable newborn and child mortality. There is a crucial need
for an independent Data Coordinating Center (DCC) to provide statistical and operational expertise that
helps the GN complete high-impact research to influence policy. RTI has been the GN’s DCC since 2001
and proposes to continue in this role for the next cycle. We will maximize the global impact of the GN and
ensure a productive and accessible GN by collaborating with study investigators—both within and outside
the Network—to develop rigorous and relevant Network research protocols and budgets. We will ensure
seamless incorporation of research protocols developed by both GN and non-Network investigators through
systems developed to inform study design using knowledge of the GN sites. (1) Optimize the scientific
quality and operational efficiency of GN studies by supporting protocol design, training, implementation, and
study monitoring; developing rigorous statistical analysis plans; incorporating common data elements; and
effectively procuring external services, as needed, to support the research implementation. (2) Ensure high-
quality data collection and data management, rigorous monitoring of study progress, quality, and participant
safety. (3) Maximize the validity and scientific impact of Network research by providing timely, accurate
statistical analyses of GN research to support publication of study results; ensuring timely dissemination and
public sharing of data at study completion; and supporting study oversight by the Data Safety Monitoring
Board, the Steering Committee, research units, NICHD. (4) Enhance the efficiency, productivity, and
outreach of Network operations to Network and non-Network investigators by providing broad logistical
support, including telecommunications, meeting coordination and organization, web-based internal and
external communication systems, and regulatory support. Dr. Elizabeth McClure, the proposed PI, has
extensive experience in maternal and newborn studies, and will be assisted by senior research staff with
significant GN experience. This application has unique strengths to help advance the GN research agenda:
(1) a highly qualified, collaborative PI and staff with in-depth knowledge; (2) proven track record of scientific
productivity and leveraging the GN infrastructure to address emerging issues to advance NICHD scientific
goals; (3) robust data systems customized for the GN to ensure data quality for harmonized research; (4)
experts in biostatistics, epidemiology, community health, nutrition, infant development, and health
economics; and (5) a flexible administrative structure to help realize the NICHD vision to optimize the GN."
10895494,"Metastasis is the primary cause of breast cancer-related morbidity and mortality. During metastasis, cells from
primary tumors shed into the bloodstream as circulating tumor cells (CTCs). CTCs travel to distant organs to
establish secondary tumors. CTCs that form clusters exhibit a drastic increase in metastatic potential compared
to single CTCs. While previous studies have described E-cadherin as a key mediator of adhesion in CTC clusters
and metastasis, many breast tumors, including tumors of the highly metastatic triple negative breast cancer
(TNBC), express little to no E-cadherin. Thus, an alternative, E-cadherin-independent mechanism must exist to
mediate clustering between CTCs, thereby promoting metastasis and disease progression. To investigate CTC
clustering mechanisms, we developed an in vitro tumor cell clustering assay that incorporates physiological
shear force and mimics in vivo conditions. Using this assay, we found that E-cadherin-negative metastatic breast
cancer cells can form cellular interactions with characteristics similar to cell adherens junctions. Speculating that
extracellular matrix (ECM) components from tumor cells may contribute to CTC clustering, we analyzed ECM
components by breast cancer subtypes. We found that hyaluronic acid synthase 2 (HAS2), which is the primary
enzyme responsible for hyaluronic acid (HA) production in breast cancer cells, is significantly upregulated in
TNBC. We further observed that HA mediates clustering between TNBC tumor cells and confers them with the
ability to overcome insults present in the bloodstream, including shear forces. Importantly, we detected HA
enrichment at the cell-cell junction of interacting CTCs in TNBC patient blood specimens. Mechanistically, our
preliminary results suggest that metastatic TNBC cells upregulate HAS2 expression in a chromatin looping
mechanism mediated by PRDM6, a transcriptional regulator and putative histone lysine methyltransferase.
Collectively, these preliminary findings lead us to hypothesize that in aggressive TNBC, high levels of HA
augment CTC clustering via HA-dependent adhesive interactions between neighboring cells. We further
hypothesize that the PRDM6 upregulates HA levels through epigenetic modulation of HAS2 expression,
including chromatin looping interactions. We propose to study our hypotheses through two specific aims: 1)
determine the role of HA in TNBC tumor cell clustering and metastasis and 2) elucidate the epigenetic regulation
of HAS2 that impacts breast tumor cell clustering. To investigate our hypotheses, we will utilize novel in vitro
clustering assays and in vivo mouse models along with electron microscopy to reveal the structural
characteristics of CTC clusters. In addition, we will utilize integrative multi-omics data analysis to elucidate the
co-regulatory network governing HAS2 expression during CTC clustering. Importantly, our results will be
extensively validated in blood specimens from metastatic TNBC patients. Consequently, successful completion
of our proposed work will not only identify a novel mechanism that mediates strong cell-cell interactions, but also
pave the mechanistic groundwork for identifying novel therapeutic options to suppress CTC clustering."

This K24 Mid-Career Mentoring Award supports my further career development and 50% protected time for
mentoring and research. My patient-oriented research has bridged the intersection between HIV and geriatric
medicine, through which I have developed a research program to describe the epidemiology and underlying
mechanisms of HIV and aging, and introduced interventions focused on the successful aging of people with
HIV (and other infectious diseases). Through the K24 award, I propose to take my research from the bench
and the bedside into the clinic and community by gaining training in dissemination/implementation and
community-based research principles (Training Aim 1) and health equity and inclusion in research,
mentorship, and leadership (Training Aim 2). To provide hands-on training for these career development
aims, I will focus on improving methods for measurement of muscle mass and quality in physical activity
interventions (Aim 1). In Aim 2, I will work to improve methods for pragmatic and feasible interventions through
a systematic review of existing interventions, input from key informants, and an environmental scan, with a
focus on what is feasible and acceptable. We will conduct a systematic review and individual or group
interviews, and used mixed methods to incorporate these findings with data from the parent R01, HEALTH.
Lastly, I will use knowledge from Aims 1 and 2 to enhance existing physical activity programs for greater
dissemination and implementation (Aim 3). I will be supported by mentors with expertise in dissemination/
implementation and health equity, in addition to three ongoing mentors with cross-disciplinary research
programs, outstanding mentorship accolades, and leadership positions within their institutions. Lastly, my
institution has provided me with the additional support, most critically in time protected from additional clinical
or administrative duties. In summary, the proposed K24 will leverage my current R01 to serve as a training
platform for trainees and incorporate my career development objectives, ultimately advancing the science of
interventions to preserve physical function in older people with HIV and support patient-oriented researchers."
10890181,"The goal of this K24 revised application is to build and enhance a research and training program focusing on
investigating mechanisms and potentially related therapies for vascular contributors to cognitive aging and
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The scientific basis for focusing on this area of Patient-Oriented Research (POR) is
that increasingly, alterations in both systemic and brain vascular systems are being identified as risk factors and
potentially involved in the causal pathway for both age-related cognitive decline and dementia, including AD.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) share many risk factors, such as hypertension and
diabetes. A common potentially unifying hypothesis is that both CVD and AD involve an endothelial dysfunctional
state that affects multiple brain processes such as perfusion, hemodynamic regulation, blood-brain barrier
permeability, atherosclerotic progression and immune-inflammatory pathways leading to cognitive decline and
AD pathology. From a therapeutic perspective, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have a pleiotropic effect on
the endothelium and my studies conducted over the last few years suggest it has a therapeutic potential. My
career aims under this application is to (a) establish a POR training program focused on clinical trials into my
current and future funded research activities; (b) Identify and train clinician and non-clinician investigators,
particularly from underrepresented minorities, interested in being engaged in POR; and (c) enhance my research
skills- through learning new proteomic methods and cell biology for development of biomarkers in AD clinical
trials, and mentorship skills in POR. To achieve these career goals, I will leverage an excellent research and
training environment at Emory University and build on a robust ongoing and NIH-funded set of studies (1 cohort
and 2 active clinical trials) to experientially learn and teach these new skills. Specifically, I propose ancillary
studies to my active research that aim to: (d) validate endothelial-based proteins discovered in untargeted
proteomics in the CSF collected from individuals in my ongoing 3 studies and investigate if they are altered after
1 year of angiotensin receptor blocker treatment; and (e) to investigate the effect of ARBs on progenitor cells,
linked to AD, and perform a pilot study to assess if using scRNAseq on peripheral blood (with and without
pharmacological bone marrow mobilization) reveals differential functions of these cells. The success in
mentoring clinicians and scientists in POR to date and the robust and productive research activities ensures my
success. This K24 is a critical step in my midcareer to ultimately reach my leadership and independence goals."

Efforts to accurately estimate the prevalence of pain and quality of pain management in the
population of patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) have met with
varied success. Communication about pain can be extremely challenging for patients with
advanced dementia, and the etiology of pain difficult to determine. In addition, patients may
resist pain treatments due to their inability to understand the purpose of analgesia and may
receive decreased benefit from analgesia due to the disruption of the placebo effect. Family
caregivers (family members, spouses, friends or others who assume the critical caregiving role)
are at high risk for chronic stress, deteriorating physical health, financial difficulties, and
premature death. They suffer from high rates of depression, anxiety and grief; pain
management for their patients has been one of the most commonly expressed concerns. Based
on preliminary work whereby we examined pain management challenges and needs of
caregivers of patients with ADRD, we designed a behavioral intervention entitled ENCODE to
assist caregivers in effectively identifying and communicating their pain management challenges
and needs. We propose a 5- year randomized clinical trial in which caregivers of patients with
ADRD will be randomly assigned to a group receiving standard care with the addition of “friendly
calls” (attention control group) or a group receiving standard care with the addition of the
ENCODE intervention (intervention group). The specific aims are to assess the impact of the
intervention on caregiver outcomes including quality of life, health, anxiety and depression, and
their perceptions of the intervention. Additionally, in order to facilitate the adoption of the
intervention in practice we will conduct a cost analysis demonstrating the costs associated with
its delivery and identify barriers and facilitators to adoption."
10760234,"ABSTRACT
Older adults represent a fast-growing segment of medical marijuana (MM) users in this country, with chronic
pain as the most cited reason for use. There is a critical need to systematically examine MM’s short- and long-
term effects on the core outcomes including pain intensity, physical, emotional, and cognitive functioning, and
overall quality of life, and to track its side effects in older adults (NOT-DA-20-014). While the ubiquity of mobile
technology provides a unique opportunity to measure MM use and its outcomes in vivo, it has not been applied
in MM and pain research. In addition, our research shows that telomere length, a measure of cellular aging, is
negatively associated with chronic pain stage, but no study has used telomere length as a biomarker to
examine MM’s long-term effects on biological aging in older adults. Further, while contributing to the
differentiated response to MM, individual differences (e.g., sex, baseline pain phenotyping, expectancy) have
not been adequately explored in prior research. To address these gaps, we propose the first prospective
cohort study that innovatively combines technology-based ecological momentary assessments (EMA) and in-
person visits over 12 months to obtain both subjective and objective data on MM’s effects. The main goals of
this project are to 1) determine MM’s short- and long-term effects on pain, physical, emotional, and cognitive
functioning, and quality of life in older adults, and 2) identify MM product characteristics and patient subgroups
associated with improved outcomes or side effects. To accomplish these goals, we will recruit and follow 440
older adults (³ 50 years, 50% male) with chronic pain as some initiate MM (n=330) and other do not (n=110).
Subjective and objective data will be collected at in-person visits (baseline & 12 months) and via smartphone-
and sensor-based measurement bursts at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months. The specific aims are: 1) Determine whether
MM use leads to short-term changes in pain intensity level, physical and emotional functioning measured in
real-time; 2) Determine whether MM use leads to longer-term changes over 12 months, including pain
intensity, emotional, physical, and cognitive functioning, health-related quality of life, and telomere length; and
3) Among those initiating MM, examine which MM product characteristics (i.e., THC:CBD ratio, administration
route, dose) predict more improvements in outcomes defined in Aims 1&2 or more side effects, and whether
individual differences (e.g., sex, baseline pain phenotyping, expectancy) moderate the relationship. With
multisource data collected in real-time and over 12 months, our results will contribute to the greatly needed
scientific evidence on: 1) whether MM can reduce pain and improve physical/emotional functioning in short
term among older adults; 2) whether effects of MM last for 12 months and demonstrate quality of life
improvements or cognitive changes; 3) whether health benefits and consequences differ by MM product type;
and 4) which subgroups of patients may benefit more from MM use."
10760312,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The skin serves as a primary barrier to the external world and is thus often injured. As such, rapid repair
of tissue damage is vital for organismal survival. Failure to repair wounds results in the formation of chronic or
non-healing wounds, which affect over 2% of the western population and cost an estimated 25 billion dollars to
manage annually. Immunosuppression is one major predisposing factor to chronic wound formation, indicating
that signals derived from immune cells are necessary for optimal repair. Yet, there is a significant gap in our
understanding of exactly how immune cells are activated and precisely how they crosstalk with the epithelium to
direct repair.
 Normal skin comprises a myriad of “homeostatic” immune cell types that actively patrol the tissue in
health and we find are rapidly activated and recruited to the site of injury. These include type 17 immune cell
subsets that have only been uncovered in the last 10 years and whole function in repair has not been studied in
immunocompetent animals. We systematically ablated each type 17 cell type to determine their role in activating
the wound edge epithelium and found that in type17-γδ T cells, but not other subsets are absolutely necessary
for wound -re-epithelialization. This crosstalk is mediated by the prototypic cytokines IL-17A/F signaling directly
into the epithelium via their receptor IL-17RC. Surprisingly, we uncovered that IL17RC signaling activates HIF1a
protein, and that this signaling axis is required for optimal HIF1a activation at the wound edge even in the pres-
ence of hypoxia. Loss of epithelial HIF1a profoundly disrupts wound re-epithelization indicating that this tran-
scription factor is a master regulator of epithelial activation at the wounds edge. While type17-γδ T cells have
been studied in pathogen responses, how they are recruited and activated in wounds is poorly understood.
Additionally, exactly how IL17 signaling induces HIF1a is unclear and the molecular targets of HIF1a that drive
repair require elucidation.
 We will address these fundamental questions in two independent aims: (1) How are type17-γδ T cells
recruited to and activated at the wound’s re-epithelizing front? ; (2) How does inflammatory HIF1a control re-
epithelialization programs downstream of IL-17? Decoding the molecular interactions between wound-associ-
ated lymphocytes and would edge epithelium, as we propose here, is an essential first step in finding immune-
based therapies for chronic non-healing wounds. Moreover, many inflammatory conditions and cancers, driven
by type 17 immunity, co-opt features wound repair. Thus, our studies will not only unearth fundamental mecha-
nisms of immune-epithelial crosstalk in repair, but may also provide novel therapeutic targets for a range of
type17 immunity-mediated epithelial pathologies."
10761695,"Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) affects almost one in five VA patients overall and almost one in
four VA patients who are racial and ethnic minorities. Adherence to medication regimens and lifestyle factors
(such as diet and exercise) is important to improve outcomes in T2D. Adherence to these factors and subsequent
achievement of outcomes is related, at least in part, to effective communication in medical encounters.
Empowering and activating patients to use more effective communication behaviors with their providers leads to
better adherence to treatment and better biomedical outcomes. However, interventions to improve
communication have not been adopted in practice largely due to the cost of trained personnel to deliver the
training. Thus, there is a gap in effective interventions that can improve communication related outcomes. In a
recent VA HSR&D funded trial we showed efficacy of the Speak Up! video. Veterans watching the video had
significantly higher self-efficacy to communicate and lower hemoglobin A1c at follow-up.
Significance: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is common, expensive, and chronic. Estimates put the prevalence of T2D
at almost 20 percent. The proposed study is highly significant because the condition under study, T2D, is highly
prevalent and has negative impacts for Veterans with the symptoms and sequalae of T2D. Our objective to
activate patients’ communication to achieve goals of care and to improve outcomes of T2D is responsive to VA
priorities to improve customer service, primary care practice, and care of complex chronic diseases.
Innovation: Our proposal to engage patients in communication in medical visits is innovative because
addressing patients’ communication as contrasted with providers’ communication is unique in the VA. It is also
innovative because activating patients facilitates patient-centered care and shared decision making which are
key goals in the VA/DOD guideline for the management of T2D and contributes to VA’s commitment to the Whole
Health model. Also, our intervention could be a paradigm for encouraging patients with other conditions to use
active participatory communication. Specifically, the design and communication content of Speak Up! could
serve as a model for the development of activation interventions for Veterans with other conditions.
Specific Aims: Our proposed Hybrid Type 2 study has two specific aims: Aim 1. Implementation aim – In
partnership with key clinical staff develop a strategy to deliver the Speak Up! video in VA outpatient primary care
clinics using a facilitated Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) process. Aim 2. Effectiveness aim – Examine the
effectiveness of the Speak Up! video using the RE-AIM framework to evaluate Reach into the patient population,
Effectiveness to improve outcomes (Hemoglobin A1c, communication self-efficacy, diabetes distress), Adoption
by providers and clinics, Implementation (completion, fidelity, and intensity), and Maintenance after the end of
external facilitation. Hypothesis 1. Patients will have improvements in outcomes (A1c, diabetes distress,
communication self-efficacy) from before to after watching the video. Exploratory Hypothesis 2. Patients that
are at higher risk of having challenges communicating with physicians (patients with low health literacy, African-
American patients, patients with depression) will also have improvements in outcomes.
Methodology: The proposed study is a Hybrid Type 2 effectiveness – implementation trial of the intervention
using a cluster-randomized stepped-wedge design in six clinics. We will test our implementation strategies using
a formative evaluation guided by the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS)
framework, and we will use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM)
framework: to examine effectiveness of the Speak Up! Video; to supplement the formative evaluation from
PARIHS; and to conduct a summative evaluation to evaluate success of the implementation strategies.
Implementation/Next Steps: This proposal will test the feasibility of implementing the Speak Up! video in
primary care and if successful will generate the evidence to justify widespread dissemination of the video."

The lack of effective pain treatments has catalyzed the opioid epidemic in America, causing an estimated 93,000
deaths in 2020, calling for more effective and non-opioid based management. One alternative pain treatment is
via nerve stimulators, which are devices placed near a peripheral nerve or on the spinal cord and use electrical
signals to modulate the perception of pain. Most nerve stimulators are surgically implanted and made of
permanent metal wires. A pulse generator and battery pack are also surgically implanted under the skin. These
devices can provide effective pain relief to patients, but have excessively high complication rates of 30-40%,
resulting from the wire moving, breaking, not working, or the implantable battery pack or permanent wire causing
new sites of pain. These complications require yet another surgery to correct the problem, increasing costs for
the patient and the healthcare system. Temporary nerve stimulators can mitigate some of the complications,
but these are made of permanent materials and must be removed after 60 days, while the removal causes 10-
15% lead fracture leaving the lead permanently in the body. Vanish Therapeutics proposes a bioresorbable, non-
surgical peripheral nerve stimulator to treat chronic pain. Once inserted, the device will provide electrical
stimulation for up to 60 days, after which it will be safely degraded by applying an anodic electrical stimulus
resulting in resorption by the body, eliminating the need for any revision surgeries. This Phase I project will
establish feasibility and produce safety/efficacy data for a Phase II application. Towards this goal, we will
1) Develop the minimally invasive stimulation lead composed of entirely bioresorbable components. The
electrochemical properties and degradation profile will be characterized and optimized to meet the application
needs. Stimulation will be tested in physiological saline solution, and the electrode must be capable of delivering
at least 550,000,000 stimulation pulses, equivalent to 60 days of full-time clinical stimulation. The degradation of
the device will then be accelerated with an anodic electrical stimulus. The toxicity of the material/device and
degradation products will be evaluated following ISO standards.
2) Design the wearable external pulse generator with programmable stimulation current profiles and an active
impedance measurement circuit. The device will deliver the electrical stimulations for pain relief and drive the
degradation of the wire after the end of stimulation.
3)Validate the stimulation efficacy and degradation safety of the integrated stimulator in a rat neuropathic pain
model. Using the previously developed pulse generator and injectable electrode, animals will be stimulated for
60 days, with weekly electrochemical and electrophysiological measurements to monitor the electrode function.
After stimulation, the electrode will be subjected to electrically driven degradation, resulting in rapid bioresorption
of the device. Histology up to 180 days post-implant will be performed to evaluate the long term safety and
degradation profile."

10767791,"PROJECT SUMMARY
B cells have an important pathogenic role in neurological autoimmune disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (MS)
and neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NP-SLE), one of the most disabling manifestations of SLE.
The relevance of B cells in central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity is underscored by the therapeutic
efficacy of mAb-mediated B cell depletion in MS. How autoreactive B cells are generated and infiltrate the CNS
remains enigmatical. The CNS is enclosed within three membranes: pia, arachnoid, and dura. Between the
arachnoid and pia lies the subarachnoid space, which contains cerebrospinal fluid that harbors assorted immune
cells, including B cells. During neuroinflammation, blood lymphocytes infiltrate the meninges to mount local
humoral and/or cellular responses. Thus, meningeal B cells are thought to exclusively derive from the systemic
circulation. However, we recently showed that in young adult mice meningeal B cells mainly derive from the bone
marrow of cranial flat bones, known as calvaria, through special vascular channels. During aging, in contrast,
age-associated-B cells (ABC) migrate from the periphery into the dura, where they may differentiate into Ig-
secreting plasma cells. We hypothesize that meningeal B cells that derive from calvaria and differentiate locally
are tolerant to CNS-Ag. By contrast, B cells that originate from the periphery and hence are not educated by the
local antigenic milieu, may differentiate into autoreactive plasma cells upon CNS-Ag encounter. In Aim 1, we will
investigate mechanisms of meningeal B cell tolerance to local antigens under steady-state. Preliminary data
suggest that self-Ag experience during B cell development induces meningeal B cell depletion. Alongside, we
will examine meningeal B cell activation upon foreign Ag encounter. Finally, we will investigate the impact of the
microenvironment in dura B cell development, focusing on CXCL12 produced by dura fibroblasts. In Aim 2, we
will investigate autoreactivity of meningeal B cells and plasma cells in the SWAP-70/DEF6 double knock-out
(DKO) model of lupus. Preliminary data show accumulation of plasmablasts in the meninges of DKO mice. We
will compare the transcriptional profiles and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires of B cells and plasma cells from
the dura and spleen to determine whether systemic B cells clones disseminate equally in lymphoid organs and
meninges, or whether the CNS environment recruits specific clones that further differentiate into plasma cells. In
parallel, DKO mice will be examined for behavioral alterations and CNS pathology. We will also identify the
utmost expanded BCR clones in the dura of DKO mice and generate monoclonal antibodies to ascertain
specificity for autoantigens. In Aim 3, we will obtain a single-cell transcriptomic profile of human dura immune
cells isolated from autoptic specimens, filling a critical gap in our knowledge of human meninges. Overall, this
proposal will advance our understanding of B cells in the CNS and mechanisms that promote neuroinflammation.
To achieve this, we will leverage the complementary expertise of the Colonna lab, which studies
neuroinflammation, and the Pernis lab, which studies autoimmunity in both humans and mouse models."

 Age is the greatest risk factor for a host of chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular
disease and neurodegeneration. The mechanistic basis for this shared risk and its continued increase as a
function of age is not well understood. Caloric restriction (CR) without malnutrition has been proven to delay
aging in diverse species, and in mammals it delays the onset of numerous age-related diseases, increasing
healthspan. The Aging and CR in Rhesus Monkeys study at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center
established the efficacy of CR in improving health and survival: CR monkeys live longer, have lower incidence
of age-related diseases, are more active, and maintain better glucoregulatory health. Molecular profiling studies
suggest that CR induces a major reprogramming of metabolism, with changes in key cellular homeostatic
pathways coordinated across transcriptional, proteomic, and post-translation modification regulatory
mechanisms. Our limited studies to date have identified novel aspects in CR's mechanisms including lipid
metabolism and signaling, and the role of RNA-based regulatory mechanisms including transcript processing
and coordination of the CR response through microRNA. The proposed studies have potential to uncover further
regulatory mechanisms engaged during aging and CR at the tissue specific level, derive interaction networks
within and among tissues to define the molecular details of how CR works, and relate these data to whole animal
physiology, health, morbidity, and survival. This unique cohort of monkeys presents an unprecedented
opportunity to advance our understanding of aging biology. Although the intervention of CR may not be a
reasonable choice for clinical application, the proposed unbiased high-resolution studies are certain to reveal
new insights into how aging itself might be targeted clinically.
 There are three Specific Aims:
 Aim 1. Determine shared and tissue-specific mechanisms engaged by CR.
 Aim 2. Determine the life stage-resolved systemic response to CR.
 Aim 3. Integrate the physiological, systemic, and molecular responses to CR.
Our study is designed to define the integrated response to CR within and among tissues and at the whole
organism level in primates, and to determine how these CR-engaged mechanisms might coordinate to confer
enhanced longevity. Rhesus monkeys are a highly translational model for human aging, in particular with regards
to the timing of onset of age-related diseases and disorders and the dynamics of functional decline. Our cohort
is derived from a unique study of effective implementation of CR, with physiological data and specimens in hand,
along with substantial longitudinal clinical data, health records, and end of life pathology. Integrative analysis of
high-density molecular profiles within and among tissues will present a new perspective in aging biology at the
systems level, and by linking to clinical outcomes will deliver translational insights for human aging."

Project Summary
Human cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is the major and most clinically relevant drug-metabolizing enzyme,
notoriously known for its extreme substrate promiscuity and allosteric behavior. Drugs and other xenobiotics
can also stimulate and inhibit CYP3A4 activity, which frequently leads to undesired drug-drug interactions
(DDIs), chemical toxicity and therapeutic failures. Despite extensive investigations, the CYP3A4 inhibitory and
activation mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This proposal centers on using structural biology
approaches to address key issues in both areas of CYP3A4 research. Aim 1 is set to investigate the CYP3A4
inhibitory mechanism via rational structure-based design of analogues of ritonavir, an HIV protease inhibitor
whose ability to potently inhibit CYP3A4 was purely coincidental. We will identify structural determinants
required for potent inhibition by rationally designing and investigating structure-activity relations of ritonavir-like
compounds and, based on our findings, build a 3D-pharmacophore model for a potent CYP3A4-specific
inhibitor that can be used for early prediction/elimination of the inhibitory potential in drug candidates and for
development of more effective pharmacoenhancers. Aim 2 will utilize an integrated biochemical, chemical
labeling, structural and computational approach to investigate the CYP3A4 substrate binding cooperativity and
allosterism. Our recent structural findings confirmed the importance of the previously mapped peripheral area
and identified three novel inner sites that could serve for substrate/effector docking. We will evaluate the role
and relative importance of these areas by assessing how their modification/disruption affects CYP3A4
conformation, substrate binding cooperativity, stoichiometry and metabolism. The research outlined in this
proposal is important from both the basic and translational science perspectives, because it will fill the
knowledge gaps and provide fundamental insights into plasticity and adaptability of CYP3A4 to structurally
diverse ligands, clarify molecular mechanisms underlying the complex ligand binding behavior and oxidative
kinetics, and help develop better tools for in silico prediction of protein-ligand contacts, metabolic stability and
DDI potential in drug candidates to improve their efficacy and reduce off-target effects.

Project Description
MOTIVATION AND OBJECTIVES
 Complex genetic mechanism of quantitative traits may include gene interaction effects commonly referred to as
epistasis and multiple genetic factors with small effects. This is among the most difficult genetic areas due to difficulties
to discover and the need of large samples to detect many small effects. The U.S. Holstein cattle have the largest genomic
evaluation program in the world with 3,852,580 genotyped cattle by March 2021, and the number of genotyped cattle
increased at a pace of ~600,000 per year. Among the genotyped cows, phenotypic records were available for 43 traits
covering production, reproduction, health, longevity, and body shape and structure. Majority of these traits have been
collected and evaluated for decades. In addition, more new traits may become available continuously. The unprecedented
sample sizes of the genomic selection data of U.S. Holstein cattle provide an unprecedented opportunity for understanding
and utilizing complex genetic mechanisms of quantitative traits. Preliminary results using 294,076 Holstein cows for 8
traits already had interesting discovery that would have been unimaginable, including a single chromosome region
interacting with all chromosomes, intra-chromosome epistasis covering an entire chromosome, and nearly exclusively
inter-chromosome epistasis for one trait. With methods and computing tools to study complex genetics developed by PI’s
group as well as encouraging preliminary results, this proposed research is an unprecedented large-scale study on genomic
discovery and prediction for 43 traits mostly with one million cows using complex multigenic models that have never been
attempted before, are expected to generate many new discoveries, and have potential to advance multigenic knowledge to
a new level. The long-term goal of this project is to identify multigenetic factors underlying quantitative traits, to
understand how multigenetic factors affect phenotypes, and to apply multigenetic mechanisms and factors to predict
phenotypes. Specific aims are as follows.
 Aim 1: Large-scale discovery of global pairwise epistasis effects for 43 traits covering production, reproduction,
health, and body shape and structure by testing four types of epistasis effects per SNP pair, additive × additive, additive ×
dominance, dominance × additive, and dominance × dominance using million cow genome-wide association study
(GWAS) for most of the 43 traits. These tests will identify the most important epistasis type underlying each trait, and
chromosome regions and genes with the most significant epistasis effects for epistasis network with unprecedented
statistical confidence. All four types of epistasis effects will be further analyzed as intra- and inter-chromosome epistasis
effects to investigate their potential association with the trait heritability and response to genetic selection. Selected
chromosome regions with important epistasis effects will be subjected to fine mapping using increased sample size and
high SNP density by imputing.
 Aim 2: Evaluation of the contributions of complex genetics effects to the phenotypic variance and the accuracy of
genomic prediction. Genomic heritability of each type of genetic effects will be estimated as a measure of the contribution
to the phenotypic variance. Observed prediction accuracy from validation studies is used as an objective measure for the
relevance of any type of genetic effects to the accuracy of genomic prediction, and any genetic effect affecting prediction
accuracy is considered relevant to the phenotype. The combination of this genomic estimation and prediction under
complex model with the GWAS approach will yield uniquely high confidence results of multigenic mechanisms underlying
quantitative traits.
 Aim 3: Evaluation of prediction accuracy of complex models for traits that benefit from any or a combination of
dominance, global epistasis and locally high-order epistasis effects using large sample validation studies. This process will
lead to recommendations for routine applications of the prediction models with complex genetic effects in genomic
evaluation.
BROADER IMPACTS
 The novel discoveries in multigenic mechanisms of quantitative traits in Holstein cattle are expected to advance the
understanding of complex genetic mechanism of quantitative traits in diploid species and benefit the scientific community
in research, teaching and training. The research approach will facilitate opening new direction for studying and utilizing
multigenic mechanisms of quantitative traits. New methods for genomic prediction with complex genetic mechanism may
increase the efficiency of genetic selection for some of the most difficult traits facing the dairy industry such as fertility
and health. Solutions from this project will enhance collaboration between academics and U.S. dairy industry, and
increased prediction accuracy of genomic prediction using complex genetic effects may translate into substantial economic
benefits for U.S. dairy industry.

10767871,"Project Summary Abstract
Despite extensive research linking poverty to mental illness, there is a dearth of studies examining
mechanisms of resilience against complex proximal stressors in low-resource settings. Our
previous work, conducted during Dr. Swahn’s Fulbright Award and via long-standing
collaborations with Makerere University, demonstrates that urban youth in Kampala, Uganda,
particularly Adolescent Girls and Young Women (AGYW) experience many adverse social
drivers which contribute to their poor mental health.
 Our proposed TOPOWA project (meaning empowerment) will used a mixed-methods
approach to examine the mechanisms for which Socioeconomic Strengthening Targeted
Training (SeSTT) moderates the pathway between the adverse effects of poverty (proximal social
and environmental stressors) and mental illness among AGYW in Kampala. Previous, but
limited, research demonstrates the positive impact of SeSTT on employment and improved
mental health among AGYW. Building on the Social Determinants of Mental Health (SDoMH)
and the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) frameworks, we will target AGYW ages 18-24 years,
the age period when most mental health symptoms are manifested and expressed. Embedded
within the SDoMH conceptual model we will focus on stress, operationalized through the RDoC
framework as Negative Valence -Acute, Sustained Threat and Arousal and Regulatory Systems.
 Using a multicomponent 27-month, parallel prospective cohort design of AGYW, we will
recruit 300 participants to determine the pathways and mechanisms of mental health outcomes
using 10 quarterly, tablet administered survey assessments (Time 1-10). Participants will be
those enrolled in a community-based intervention program (n=150and an age- and location-
matched non-intervention community sample (n=150). The objective is to determine the
mechanistic changes of SeSTT on the proximal social stressors and mental health outcomes
(i.e., anxiety, depression, suicidality and substance use symptoms and disorders) among
AGYW."

Atherosclerosis is a progressive disease characterized by the development of lipid-rich, inflammatory plaque
lesions within vessel walls. It is the underlying basis of cardiovascular diseases including myocardial infarction,
stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. However, the ability to reliably detect the vulnerable plaque and identify
high-risk patients has been a challenge. Further, there is no imaging agent to detect the eroded plaques, a less-
known subtype accounting for one third of clinical events. Chemokines and chemokine receptors play important
roles in atherosclerosis from initialization to clinical event by directing leukocyte trafficking. We have developed
chemokine receptor targeted positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents and demonstrated the
specific detection of monocyte trafficking in vivo and track plaque progression and regression. To further
explore the potential of these imaging agents for translation, we would like to propose a research program to
develop novel PET tracers with potential to identify vulnerable plaques, detect plaque erosion, and more
importantly to track the treatment response to improve patient outcome. Specifically, we will firstly optimize the
design and synthesis of a portfolio of PET tracers targeting plaque-relevant targets including CCR2, CCR5,
CXCR3, CD44, and TLR2 to improve the radiolabeling and scale-up capability through controlled
radiochemistry and bioconjugate chemistry, and binding affinities by varying the charge, surface chemistry and
polymer coating materials. Secondly, we will perform in vivo biodistribution studies and PET imaging in
atherosclerosis progression/regression and complication mouse models, as well as rabbit atherosclerosis
models to assess the imaging specificity, sensitivity, and capability to track the immune cells in vivo and
correlation with targets expression and plaque characteristics. Thirdly, we will assess the capability of
developed imaging probes to determine treatment response for improved outcome and binding to ex vivo
human plaque tissue for future translation. We propose to submit multiple exploratory investigational new drug
application to FDA and have two PET tracers ready for human trials at the end of grant period. The
establishment of this research program will not only promote the development of targeted PET tracers for
atherosclerosis translational imaging, but also broader applications in other diseases within the NHLBI mission."

innovative basic and translational research and the conduct of impactful clinical trials. The Program’s members
work collaboratively to advance knowledge across the continuum of breast cancer: from prevention, screening,
and early diagnosis to treatment and survivorship. The goals are to increase cure rates and reduce morbidity
among those who ultimately succumb to the disease and those who live with the late effects of therapy.
The program has 117 members (73 primary and 44 secondary), representing all seven DF/HCC institutions
and 16 academic departments. In 2019, peer-reviewed grant funding attributed to the Program was $8.1 million
in direct costs from the NCI and $2.4 million from other sponsors. During the current funding period, primary
Program members published 936 cancer-relevant papers. Of these, 28% were inter-institutional, 22% were
intra-programmatic, and 42% were inter-programmatic collaborations between two or more DF/HCC members.
To achieve the Program’s mission, our Specific Aims are to 1) Define and address the heterogeneity in
triple-negative breast cancer; 2) Characterize the biology to improve outcomes from breast cancer
metastases to the brain; 3) Improve the efficacy of immunotherapy for breast cancer; 4) Improve
personalized local-regional therapy; and 5) Ensure that Program advances serve Massachusetts and the
nation by addressing racial disparities and access to cancer care.
These Aims align closely with the DF/HCC Strategic Plan and will be achieved through the established and
invaluable CCSG infrastructure for collaborative transdisciplinary research, Shared Resources, and a unified
clinical trials apparatus that accelerates translation of the Program’s laboratory discoveries to the clinic."

Project Summary / Abstract
The Prostate Cancer Program seeks to improve outcomes for all prostate cancer patients by bringing together
a multidisciplinary team of investigators across the DF/HCC consortium to catalyze and accelerate research
leading to clinical benefit. A founding premise of the Program is that genuine progress in the management of
prostate cancer requires iterative fundamental discovery through research in model systems and in patient-
derived samples, clinical translation, and subsequent analysis of patient-derived clinical samples to assess
mechanisms of action and sensitivity or resistance in vivo. The Program harnesses CCSG structures and
resources to achieve this iterative cycle. Additionally, the Program addresses the diversity of our catchment
area (Massachusetts) and pays particular attention to training the next generation of basic and clinical
investigators across the consortium.
The Program’s 66 members (42 primary and 24 secondary) represent seven DF/HCC institutions and 11
academic departments. In 2019, peer-reviewed grant funding attributed to the Program was $2.6 million in
direct costs from the NCI and $3.4 million from other sponsors. During the current funding period, primary
Program members published 840 cancer-relevant papers. Of these, 27% were inter-institutional, 30% were
intra-programmatic, and 31% were inter-programmatic collaborations between two or more DF/HCC members.
To achieve the Program mission, our Specific Aims for the next CCSG funding period are to 1) Improve
detection and early treatment of aggressive prostate cancer; 2) Identify mechanisms of resistance to
current therapies and identify further targetable vulnerabilities; and 3) Exploit tumor specific vulnerabilities
through biomarker driven clinical trials that include diverse patient populations. The disproportionate burden
of prostate cancer on African American men underlies key elements of each Aim, which therefore depend in
part on the Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) functions of the Cancer Center. In addition,
Program members rely heavily on Center collaborative and clinical trials structures and shared resources."

large and vibrant membership includes investigators with a broad range of scientific interests spanning all
major aspects of cancer genetics and epigenetics. Particular areas of focus include: 1) cancer gene discovery
and functional characterization; 2) technology development and application (e.g., massively parallel

CG&E members published 1,227 cancer-relevant papers. Of these, 34% were inter-institutional, 11% were
intra-programmatic, and 50% were inter-programmatic collaborations between two or more DF/HCC members.
These numbers reflect the Program’s extensive interactions with DF/HCC’s clinical, population science, and
other basic science Programs, nurtured under the aegis of the Center strategic plan. Since the last CCSG
renewal, the emphasis on epigenetic aspects of cancer has expanded considerably, prompting changes in
both name (the Program was previously called Cancer Genetics) and leadership (C. KadochDFCI is now one of
the three co-Leaders).

spectrum of cancer driver gene mutations, rearrangements, and amplifications and translate them to enable
precision medicine; 2) Determine the chromatin state and epigenetic architecture in multiple cancers, and
determine how specific aberrations affect transcription and interact with oncogenic mutations; and 3) Discover
the germline, somatic, and chromatin determinants of response and mechanisms of resistance to anticancer

Project Summary / Abstract
The mission of the Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) Program is to facilitate and conduct research that
ensures the delivery of high-quality, patient-centered care to individuals with all types of cancer. Advances in
cancer diagnosis, screening, prevention, and treatment are usually tested and reported in defined and
relatively small groups of research subjects. Members of the CCDR Program measure the extent to which
interventions are effective when the reported advances are scaled population-wide. The Program develops,
refines, tests, and implements strategies to maximize the impact of discoveries. A particular point of emphasis
is the degree to which the benefits of research discoveries extend to patients from racial and ethnic minority
backgrounds and to those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged.
The Program has 66 members (56 primary and 10 secondary), representing all seven DF/HCC institutions and

CCDR’s emphasis on improving the experience, efficiency, and equity of cancer care ensures that innovations
in cancer treatment and care realize their full potential throughout populations and care settings. To meet the
Program mission, CCDR members have built successful collaborations, developed new research methods,
constructed data sources, and trained the next generation of clinical investigators. Our Specific Aims for the
next CCSG funding period are to: 1) Assess the quality, effectiveness, and value of new and established

10768677,"Developmental Therapeutics Program
Project Summary / Abstract
The Developmental Therapeutics (DT) Program comprises a highly collaborative effort across consortium
member institutions. It focuses on the earliest phases of bench-to-bedside preclinical and clinical evaluation of
promising new anti-cancer drugs from the NCI, from DF/HCC research laboratories, and from industry. Among
clinical trials, the Program focuses on disease-agnostic Phase 1 trials, many with expansion cohorts or Phase
2 components that cross cancer types. Strategically, the Program is tightly integrated as a DF/HCC “hub.” On
the one hand, it aligns closely with the Center’s basic science Programs in such areas as signal transduction,
DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, epigenetics, and immuno-oncology. On the other hand, it partners effectively
with DF/HCC’s disease-based Programs: once early evaluation is completed to satisfaction, DT transitions
drugs for later phases of development in disease-specific Programs.
The Program’s 77 members (30 primary and 47 secondary) represent six DF/HCC institutions and 12
academic departments. In 2019, peer-reviewed grant funding attributed to the Program was $4.6 million in
direct costs from the NCI and $0.9 million from other sponsors. During the current funding period, primary DT
members published 636 cancer-relevant papers. Of these, 30% were inter-institutional, 9% were intra-
programmatic, and 62% were inter-programmatic collaborations between two or more DF/HCC members. This
scope of inter-Program interactions reflects DT’s role as a genuine “hub” within the Cancer Center, where the
Program also hosts NCI-sponsored U54, UM1, MATCH, and other cooperative agreements for collaborative
early drug development.
Three Specific Aims are planned over the next CCSG funding period: (1) Design and conduct early phase
clinical trials of the most promising new anti-cancer agents and combinations with safety, pharmacokinetic,
pharmacodynamic and preliminary efficacy endpoints, with incorporation of biomarkers for drug response,
resistance and toxicity; (2) Increase participation of minority and underserved populations in early phase
clinical trials; and (3) Provide mentoring and career development support for early career investigators in early

Project Summary / Abstract
The mission of the Cancer Risk, Prevention, and Early Detection (CaRPED) Program is to decrease the
burden of cancer by (a) focusing a broad array of research around the critical period of cancer initiation and
early growth, and (b) devising clinically effective strategies to intercept this process among people at risk. The
Program’s scope ranges from the general population to high-risk groups to individuals with pre-cancerous
lesions or targetable mutations.
CaRPED is a new Program that evolved from a previous Program in Cancer Risk and Disparities (CaRD). Its
mission relies on leveraging DF/HCC expertise in cancer biology, epidemiology, prevention, and the science of
implementation, together with the breadth and depth of the Boston ecosystem for technological innovation. The
Program is committed to the translation of scientific advances and the dissemination of knowledge into
sustainable community-based practices as well as the alleviation of cancer-related disparities. Training a new
generation of researchers with transdisciplinary, quantitative, clinical, technological, and implementation skills
is an important Program focus.
Our 86 members (55 primary and 31 secondary) represent all seven DF/HCC institutions and 17 academic
departments. In 2019, peer-reviewed grant funding attributed to the Program was $5.7 million in direct costs
from the NCI and $6.7 million from other sponsors. During the current funding period, primary CaRPED
members published 914 cancer-relevant papers. Of these, 23% were inter-institutional, 9% were intra-
programmatic, and 43% were inter-programmatic collaborations between two or more DF/HCC members.
These numbers reflect the breadth of inter-Program interactivity stewarded by Program and senior DF/HCC
leaders in close alignment with the Cancer Center’s strategic plan.
For the next CCSG funding period, the Program’s Specific Aims are to 1) develop and validate new
technologies for pre-cancer and early cancer detection, 2) develop personalized and precision approaches for
cancer interception using new technologies for risk assessment and pre-cancer and early cancer detection,
and 3) apply personalized and precision approaches for cancer interception through multidisciplinary teams.
DF/HCC’s extensive infrastructure for transdisciplinary collaboration, innovative clinical trials, community
engagement, shared resources, education, and training will be instrumental in achieving these concrete goals."

Project Summary / Abstract
The mission of the Cancer Cell Biology (CCB) Program is to facilitate basic cancer research and accelerate the
application of basic science discoveries in the clinic through a deep understanding of the cellular and molecular
factors that underlie tumor formation, progression, and metastasis. Program members develop and utilize a
wide variety of cutting-edge technologies to address fundamental problems in cancer cell biology with the goal
of clinical translation. These technologies include molecular, biochemical, cell-based, and in vivo approaches
aimed at better understanding basic mechanisms of tumor behavior and therapeutic vulnerabilities.
The Program’s 120 members (90 primary and 30 secondary) represent all seven DF/HCC institutions and 18
academic departments. In 2019, peer-reviewed grant funding attributed to the Program was $19.3 million in
direct costs from the NCI and $13.4 million from other sponsors. During the current funding period, primary
members of the CCB Program published 1,240 cancer-relevant papers. Of these, 23% were inter-institutional,
15% were intra-programmatic, and 36% were inter-programmatic collaborations between two or more DF/HCC
members.
For the next CCSG funding period, the Program has three Specific Aims: 1) Elucidate the pathophysiology of
cancer; 2) Develop and disseminate new technologies for cancer research; and 3) Foster synergy between
clinical translation and basic research. These Aims will be achieved through established CCSG channels that
enable meaningful and productive scientific interactions between CCB and the Cancer Center’s ten disease-
specific Programs, three Basic Science Programs, three Programs in classical population sciences, and two
unique Programs in cancer risk, prevention, and early detection (CaRPED) and Developmental Therapeutics.
Overall, the Program is deeply committed to training future generations of basic and translational scientists,
including those from underrepresented minority backgrounds, and to translating our members’ fundamental
laboratory findings into proof-of-concept testing in DF/HCC clinical trials."
10768572,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a devastating disease with high mortality and no treatments. Common causes
of AKI in the VETERAN population include sepsis, trauma, drug/toxicant exposure, and ischemia/reperfusion
(IR). The long-term goal of our laboratory is to uncover novel mechanisms of AKI and develop therapeutics to
promote recovery. Following AKI, a marked reduction in renal microvasculature is observed and results in the
loss of oxygen and nutrients to extravascular tissue needed for tissue repair. In addition, there is persistent
mitochondrial dysfunction following AKI. Pathways mediating vascular repair and mitochondrial biogenesis (MB)
are under-studied. We previously confirmed the presence of the 5-HT1F receptor in renal proximal tubular cells
(RPTC) and identified the pathways of 5-HT1F receptor-mediated MB. The 5-HT1F receptor knockout mouse has
altered renal mitochondrial homeostasis and impaired renal recovery following IR-induced AKI, while the 5-HT1F
receptor agonist lasmiditan stimulated MB and improved renal recovery.
 Unlike RPTC, endothelial cells (EC) primarily derive their energy through aerobic glycolysis with limited
mitochondria and oxidative phosphorylation. Stimulation of MB via the 5-HT1F receptor in EC may promote
vascular recovery following AKI. Our preliminary data reveal that (i) primary cultures of mouse renal peritubular
endothelial cells (MRPEC) express the 5-HT1F receptor, (ii) treatment of MRPEC with lasmiditan induces MB and
increases mitochondrial function, (iii) lasmiditan stimulates MRPEC branching and wound closure, (iv) lasmiditan
stimulates MB in EC in mice, (v) lasmiditan decreases vascular leakage and improves renal recovery, (vi) mice
lacking the 5-HT1F receptor have decreased renal vasculature, and (vii) lasmiditan does not induce renal MB in
mice lacking the 5-HT1F receptor. Thus, our previous and current work suggest a role for the 5-HT1F receptor in
stimulating MB and angiogenesis in EC followingAKI.
 We hypothesize that lasmiditan, a recently FDA-approved drug, induced activation of the 5-HT1F receptor
in renal vascular endothelium promotes MB and angiogenesis, resulting in decreased vascular rarefication,
increased vascular function, and promotion of renal recovery from AKI.
 We will test this hypothesis with the following specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the 5-HT1F receptor
signaling pathway(s) responsible for MB and angiogenesis in response to the 5-HT1F receptor agonist lasmiditan
in MRPEC. Aim 2 will determine the effects of normoxia, oxidant exposure, and pro-inflammatory conditions on
MB and angiogenesis, and elucidate the efficacy and mechanism of lasmiditan in restoring mitochondrial function
and angiogenesis in MRPEC. Aim 3 will determine the role of 5-HT1F receptor expression in EC and RPTC in
vascular and renal recovery in the presence and absence of lasmiditan following IR injury AKI."
10768729,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive cancer in adult patients. Adult T-ALL is frequently
the Early T-cell Precursor (ETP-ALL) subtype that manifests with treatment-resistance and high risk of relapse.
The demographic of adult T-ALL matches that of young Veterans so this grant has the potential to impact the
diagnosis and care of this Veteran population. Like many aggressive human leukemias and lymphomas, T-ALL
can be put into remission by cytotoxic chemotherapy yet the majority of patients relapse. We have learned from
our studies that targeted therapies against mutant oncogenes stimulating proliferation, like JAK1/3, also induce
responses that are short lived. In these cancers, the high rate of complete remission followed by the high rate of
relapse is explained by the presence of treatment-resistant leukemia-initiating cells (LIC) that have hematopoietic
stem cell-like features. The LIC lie dormant and survive during chemotherapy and then expand after remission-
induction. Hence, targeting this LIC population is crucial to achieving cures. LIM domain Only-2 (LMO2) is a
major driver oncogene in T-ALL, where it confers stem cell characteristics upon normal T-cell progenitor cells.
Targeting LMO2-induced T-ALL LIC will involve targeting the LMO2 complex. Towards this end, we have
biochemically characterized the LMO2 complex to understand its structure and function. In preliminary data, we
show that LMO2’s oncogenic function requires it to act as part of a multisubunit macromolecular complex.
LMO2’s direct binding partners include the basic helix-loop-helix proteins, TAL1 or LYL1, and the GATA motif
binding proteins GATA1, 2, and 3. We discovered that LMO2’s ability to induce T-ALL is exquisitely dependent
upon another protein, LIM domain binding 1 (LDB1), to which LMO2 is constitutively bound. LDB1 has its own
interaction partners, namely the Single Stranded Binding Proteins SSBP1-4. Importantly, LMO2 complex
formation confers protein stability. In the course of our studies, we made observations that could hold the key to
better understanding LMO2’s induction of the LIC and to better targeting of the LMO2 complex. Although LMO2’s
induction of the LIC in mouse models has been extensively studied, this has not been translated to human cells.
We hypothesize that LIC properties are conferred by the LMO2 complex upon T-cell progenitor cells.
Furthermore, our proteomic studies reveal a panoply of paralogous proteins in the LMO2 complex but we do not
believe they are functionally equivalent. We hypothesize unique functional roles for the various paralogues of
the LMO2 complex, TAL1 v. LYL1, GATA factors 1-3, and SSBP factors 2 v. 3. We will investigate this in a novel
human modeling system. Lastly, we hypothesize that targeted therapy against LMO2 will involve perturbation of
the LMO2 complex. The Specific Aims of this grant will advance our understanding of how LMO2 functions and
how it may be targeted in these aggressive leukemias."
10769255,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Uterine cancer (UC) incidence and death rates are both significantly increasing in the United States. Most UCs
are endometrial cancers which arise from the inner lining of the uterus and are defined by several different
histologic subtypes, the most common of which is endometrioid. Additionally, survival outcomes are worse for
black women. Because of the worsening survival of women with advanced and relapsed endometrial cancer,
this P01 grant is focused on targeting replication stress (RS) in order to improve therapeutic outcomes in these
patients. RS is defined as the slowing or stalling of the replication fork progression during DNA synthesis and is
widely recognized as a significant cause of genomic instability and a critical feature of cancer cells. This P01
grant investigates 3 different strategies for targeting RS in UC with the goal of translating these into effective
salvage therapies for women with advanced/relapsed UC. We have assembled a team of internationally
recognized researchers from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, both in
Boston MA, with multidisciplinary expertise in UC, DNA repair and RS, immunotherapy, preclinical models,
biostatistics, computational biology, gynecologic pathology, drug development and clinical trials. This P01 grant
is being led by Drs. Panagiotis Konstantinopoulos, Joyce Liu, and Ursula Matulonis who are recognized
international leaders in the field of gynecologic cancer and endometrial cancer research.
This P01 grant consists of 3 Projects and 4 Cores. The leadership team for each Project is comprised of paired
investigators with complementary expertise in basic science and clinical/translational research. Project 1 focuses
on studying the mechanism of WEE1 inhibition in recurrent USC or p53-mutated UCs and the correlation of
WEE1 activity with functional and immunohistochemical (IHC) measures of RS. Based upon the results of a
clinical trial of the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib which previously demonstrated significant clinical activity in USCs,
this project leverages a collection of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), patient-derived organoids (PDOs), and
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of p53-mutated/null endometrial cancer to examine the effects
of WEE1 inhibition on functional and IHC measures of RS in the in vitro and in vivo setting. Additionally, through
a biopsy-driven investigator-initiated protocol of the WEE1 inhibitor ZN-c3 in USC, Project 1 will examine the
effects of WEE1 inhibition on measures of RS in co-clinical PDOs and correlation of these measures with clinical
activity. Project 2 focuses on the hypothesis that inhibition of the PI3K pathway can increase RS and therefore
create synergy with ATR inhibitors. In previously performed PRISM and CRISPR screens, inhibition of PI3K
signaling together with ATR inhibition was identified as potentially synergistic and subsequent experiments have
demonstrated synergism between the PI3K inhibitor copanlisib and the ATR inhibitor elimusertib. Project 2 will
examine in PDX, PDO, and GEMM model systems the potential for synergy between ATR and PI3K inhibition
and will explore the clinical activity of this combination in a Phase 1b dose escalation clinical trial with dose
expansion in uterine serous and ARID1A mutated uterine tumors, both enriched in concomitant PI3K pathway
alterations and genomic alterations associated with high RS. Project 3 focuses on further investigating
preliminary data showing that targeting the RS response through inhibition of DNA damage checkpoint kinases
ATR and WEE1 leads to increased DNA damage and activation of the STING/TBK1/IRF3 pathway, resulting in
enhanced anti-tumor immunity and improved response to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). Based on these, a
novel strategy is proposed to extend the benefit of immunotherapy in mismatch repair proficient (MMRP) cancers
by using DNA damage checkpoint kinase inhibitors in combination with ICIs. The main hypothesis is that priming
the immunologically “cold” MMRP UCs into “hot” tumors using DNA damage checkpoint kinase inhibition,
combined with ICIs to overcome tumor-mediated immunosuppression, will lead to effective antitumor immunity
against MMRP UCs. The 4 Cores in this grant include Administrative; Biostatistics and Computational Biology;
Preclinical Model Systems; and Pathology. Review of our P01 grant external to the Project and Core teams will
occur through an External Advisory Board (EAB), an Internal Advisory Board (IAB), and an advocate core."
10769256,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
PROJECT 1 – WEE1 inhibition in uterine serous carcinomas or p53-mutated uterine cancers
Uterine serous carcinomas (USC) are a distinct histologic subtype of uterine cancer with poor prognosis,
comprising up to 40% of uterine cancer deaths. Similarly, data from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
has shown that p53-mutated uterine cancers are often “serous-like” and have decreased overall survival
compared to other subtypes of uterine cancer. Therapeutic options for this group of patients are limited; in the
recurrent setting, chemotherapy has limited activity and few effective therapies have been identified beyond
the recently FDA-approved regimen of combination pembrolizumab and lenvatinib. Molecularly, these cancers
are characterized by features that suggest the frequent presence of concomitant cell cycle dysregulation
(alterations in TP53, CCNE1, RB1) and high oncogene-driven replication stress (alterations in MYC,
KRAS/NRAS, ERBB2), which might make these cancers particularly vulnerable to targeting replication stress
via WEE1 inhibition. A previous clinical trial of the WEE1 adavosertib in USC at our institution demonstrated
significant clinical activity with a response rate of 29.4%, although targeted next generation sequencing did not
reveal any correlation between specific molecular alterations and clinical activity. The overall objectives of this
project are to (a) assess the correlation between anti-tumor activity of WEE1-targeting agents with functional
and IHC measures of replication stress, (b) explore how IHC measures of replication stress correlate with the
activity of WEE1 inhibition in PDX and GEMM models of p53-mutated endometrial cancers and clinical
samples, and (c) evaluate the correlation of functional and IHC measures of replication stress with clinical
activity of WEE1 inhibition in uterine serous cancer in a biopsy-driven trial. We hypothesize that sensitivity of
p53-mutated uterine cancers is correlated with levels of replication stress and/or the effect of WEE1 inhibition
on replication stress. To test this hypothesis, we will investigate in vitro the effect of WEE1 inhibition on
replication fork dynamics in established endometrial cancer PDO models and the correlation between
functional and IHC measures of replication stress with sensitivity to WEE1 inhibition in these PDOs. We will
further investigate how IHC measures of DNA damage or RS, including γH2AX, pRPA, pKAP1, or pCHK1,
change in vivo after exposure to WEE1 inhibition and whether these measures correlate with in vivo activity
across a panel of established endometrial cancer PDX and GEMMs. Finally, we will assess the correlation of
functional and IHC measures of RS with clinical activity in a biomarker study of the WEE1 inhibitor Zn-c3 in
USC through the establishment of co-clinical PDO models from trial biopsy samples. The findings from these
studies will provide important mechanistic insight into how RS underlies sensitivity to WEE1 inhibition and can
also further inform the development of this novel therapeutic target and potential future biomarker development
for targeting WEE1 in USC and p53-mutated uterine cancers. These findings may also provide insight into
extension of WEE1 inhibition as a strategy in other cancer types."

Platelets play a key role in both hemostasis and thrombosis and contribute to COVID-19 pathology. Platelet
αIIbβ3 is the paradigmatic integrin receptor and a validated drug target, with abciximab, developed under this
grant, the first FDA-approved αIIbβ3 antagonist. In the current grant period, we rationally designed and
synthesized novel αIIbβ3 and αVβ3 antagonists that lock the receptor in the inactive conformation, which may
confer therapeutic benefits. The αIIbβ3 antagonist (RUC-4; zalunfiban) is now in Phase 2 human studies for pre-
hospital therapy of heart attacks and the αVβ3 antagonists are being developed for pre-clinical testing. We also
began studying key gaps in our understanding of how αIIbβ3: 1. Binds its medically important ligands, including
fibrinogen, polymerizing fibrin, von Willebrand factor (vWf), and cross-linked fibrin. 2. Initiates clot retraction to
confer resistance to thrombolysis. 3. Transitions from its inactive to its active state. Thus, we studied the
interaction of αIIbβ3 with fragment D-dimer and used a novel functional assay to dissect the interaction of αIIbβ3
with polymerizing fibrin. In addition, we obtained high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structures of
αIIbβ3 in complex with abciximab and with the activating monoclonal antibody (mAb) PT25-2, providing data on
each antibody’s mechanism of activation. We also initiated hydrogen-deuterium exchange-mass spectroscopy
(HDX) studies of αIIbβ3 to provide peptide-level dynamic structural information on ligand binding and receptor
activation to complement cryo-EM data. The new Specific Aims build on the PI’s long-standing collaborations
with Dr. Marta Filizola, an expert in computational methods, and Dr. Thomas Walz, an expert in cryo-EM.
 Specific Aim 1. A. To determine high-resolution cryo-EM structures of D-dimer and of αIIbβ3 in complex
with: 1) fibrinogen fragment D100 and fibrinogen γ-module; 2) vWf C4 domain; 3) D-dimer. B. To obtain peptide-
level solvent-exposed area data by HDX on αIIbβ3 alone and in complex with the ligands. C. To obtain
complementary structural and dynamics information from computer simulations to guide mutational analysis and
mAb production to validate the proposed mechanisms of binding, as well as to develop novel ligand-specific
small-molecule antagonists. Specific Aim 2. To utilize currently available and future cryo-EM data sets in concert
with computational and HDX data to define intermediate structures of the integrin leg domains along the αIIbβ3
activation pathway. Specific Aim 3. To utilize our novel functional polymerizing fibrin assays using platelets and
HEK293 cells expressing native and mutant forms of αIIbβ3, in concert with mAbs and small-molecule αIIbβ3
antagonists, to define the unique αIIbβ3 ligand-specific binding mechanisms and develop ligand-specific
inhibitors. A. To produce mAbs to D-dimer that inhibit platelet-fibrin, but not platelet-fibrinogen interactions. B.
To identify mutations that selectively impair fibrinogen, fibrin, or vWf binding, and examine their impact on clot
retraction. C. To test predictions derived from the structural and computational studies with mAb and small-
molecule ligand-specific inhibitors as a prelude to animal and ultimately human studies."

The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC) vision is that “Alaska Native People are the healthiest
people in the world”. To achieve this vision and to address the many health disparities faced by our Alaska
Native (AN) people, ANTHC recognizes the need for research. Current health research activities at ANTHC
build on a 65-year history of research with AN people and encompass a wide spectrum of health issues.
Research has made a dramatic contribution on the lives of the AN people and ANTHC recognizes the
importance of maintaining a robust research department with staff who are dedicated to research with AN
people and who understand the importance of Tribally driven research.
The overall goals of the proposed Alaska Native Center for Health Research (ANCHR) are to develop a
cadre of investigators in Alaska engaged in research to address health disparities in the Alaska Native
population; expand the capacity for health disparities research in Alaska; and encourage the recruitment of AN
investigators into health disparities research careers at ANTHC and other organizations in Alaska. These goals
fully align with the ANTHC vision and mission through partnerships with communities, tribal health
organizations (THO), academic institutions, and others to optimize health through addressing AN health
disparities. Hiring of new staff, particularly Alaska Native or American Indian (AN/AI) individuals will expand our
capacity to achieve our goal. We will accomplish these goals through the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Develop a cadre of ANCHR investigators based at ANTHC and other THOs and academic institutions
in Alaska engaged in research to address identified AN health disparities, through ensuring robust and
sustained mentorship of research project leads (RPLs), recruitment of AN individuals as Project Leads and
support to RPLs in generating preliminary data and in writing research proposals to secure independent
funding.
Aim 2: Strengthen capacity to support the RPLs and other investigators through the Research Core in
research design, epidemiology, biostatistics, data management, qualitative research methods, research staff
and community engagement and ensuring there is Tribal engagement, consultation, and oversight throughout
the duration of all projects.
Aim 3: Establish and fund training/educational opportunities to expand the skills of RPLs and other
investigators and actively recruit AN people into health research careers, including participation in the NARCH
funded Alaska Indigenous Research Program and NIH grant writing training and grant mock reviews.
COBRE funding for research projects and the opportunity to hire and train new investigators, will empower the
ANCHR to expand our capacity to conduct research to address health disparities in the AN population."
10770964,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Research Project 3: “The effect of high efficiency particulate air
(HEPA) filters on high particulate rural Alaska Native homes”
Alaska Native and American Indian (AN/AI) residents of rural Alaska experience a higher burden of acute and
chronic respiratory disease than the general US population. Many AN/AI people living in rural Alaska
experience poor indoor air quality (IAQ) because of substandard housing, household crowding, tobacco and
woodstove use, and inadequate ventilation. Poor IAQ harms respiratory health, especially in arctic climates
where residents spend approximately 90% of time indoors, and these factors have all been associated with
respiratory disease.
Portable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters effectively reduce indoor particulate matter
concentrations. Limited studies have evaluated the effectiveness of HEPA filters at removing particulate matter
in rural Alaska but excluded homes in which smokers reside. Because poor indoor air quality in the homes of
smokers and woodstove usage causes a high burden on respiratory health, it is important to evaluate the
performance of HEPA filtration in these “high particulate” homes.
The objective of this research is to evaluate the impact of HEPA filtration units among “high particulate” AN/AI
homes in rural Alaska, where woodstoves are utilized for heating or a smoker resides in the home. We
hypothesize that the use of HEPA filters will improve indoor air quality significantly and will decrease
respiratory signs and symptoms of residents. We will enroll 15 participants and test our central hypothesis
through the following aims:
(1) Measure the effect of HEPA filters on air quality in “high particulate” homes.
(2) Evaluate the impact of HEPA filters on reported respiratory symptoms for participants.
(3) Assess acceptability and feasibility of personal exposure monitoring devices among rural Alaska Native
participants, describe personal exposure to air pollutants other than PM2.5 that are known to be harmful to
human health, and assess whether HEPA filtration changes personal exposure to these pollutants.
This study will provide valuable information on the effects of HEPA filtration on indoor air quality and
respiratory health outcomes in an indigenous population with a high burden of lung disease and unique risk
factors that have been excluded from other studies – those living in “high particulate” homes. Additionally, we
will assess the acceptability and feasibility of wearable personal exposure monitoring devices, a new
technology that has not been utilized among AN/AI populations."
10770978,"PROJECT SUMMARY – TISSUE ANALYSIS CORE (TAC)
Cardiovascular material and device developments require a detailed understanding of human tissue physiology,
pathophysiology, structure, mechanical, and biological characteristics in relation to age, sex, race, and risk
factors, but these data are scarcely available. Procurement and processing of human tissues are challenging
and require well-developed experimental and modeling frameworks with seamless interaction between organ
procurement specialists and biomechanists. Our cardiovascular team in the Department of Biomechanics was
able to circumvent these issues and has assembled a unique database of human artery mechanical, structural,
and biological characteristics that allowed our researchers to perform advanced constitutive modeling analyses
and quantify arterial physiologic and pathophysiologic characteristics in relation to age and disease. The Tissue
Analysis Core (TAC) will build on this experience and support the needs of our Research Project Leaders (RPLs)
in soft tissue analysis while helping them develop new collaborations with the scientific and device manufacturing
communities. To achieve this, TAC will use a two-pronged approach. First, it will provide centralized services for
mechanical, structural, and biological analyses of soft tissues using multi-ratio planar biaxial and inflation-
extension-torsion testing, vapor and gas permeability assessments, structural evaluations using μCT, Duplex
and Intravascular Ultrasounds, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and histological/immunohistochemical analyses
of the main cellular and extracellular compositions. The TAC will also assist CRiB Center members and RPLs
with constitutive modeling of tissue behavior that will inform the design and development of targeted materials
and devices for vascular and endovascular repairs and post-surgical recovery. Second, TAC will ensure its long-
term sustainability and promote collaborations with the scientific community and the biomedical device industry.
Self-sustainability will be achieved through direct and indirect costs from federal research projects and industry
contracts, user fees, and a fee-for-service menu. The TAC will also offer annual workshops and micro-
credentialing opportunities in tissue analysis techniques to increase the awareness of its capabilities and
services, and to facilitate interactions between RPLs and other members of the Center. Interaction with the
scientific community will be strengthened by the development and publication of experimental protocols and the
establishment of standardized procedures for specimen and data sharing. To ensure that our TAC continues to
satisfy the needs of our RPLs and other CRiB Center members, it will collect feedback and suggestions for
improvement from users. Our TAC will provide a unique centralized resource for comprehensive soft tissue
evaluation that is not available anywhere in the United States. This will facilitate exciting new collaborations that
will support the Center and the TAC Core, help our RPLs become competitive for extramural funding, and allow
our Center to solidify its reputation as a world leader in soft tissue biomechanics."
10770442,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Relaxometry is among the most used MRI technique for quantifying tissue properties. Multi-component
relaxometry measures the relaxation characteristics of multiple water components, thus delivers both sensitive
and specific MR biomarkers for evaluating composition and microstructure of tissues such as cartilage and
myelin. However, due to the need to fit a complicated noise-sensitive MR signal model, multi-component
relaxation mapping requires repeated scans with a long scan time, limiting its widespread clinical use. The goal
of this research proposal is to develop a novel method via leveraging the latest deep learning techniques for
realizing accurate and high-quality multi-component relaxation mapping at a rapid, clinical feasible acquisition.
While many recent deep learning reconstruction studies have focused on rapid imaging for static MR images
with promising results, applications of deep learning for accelerated relaxation mapping have been limited. In
this project, we propose to develop, optimize, and evaluate a new deep learning technique that enables
accurate characterization and quantification of tissues with multi-component relaxation properties. Building on
the foundation of our newly developed deep learning method for rapid imaging, our proposed approach will
utilize an efficient end-to-end convolutional neural network to directly convert undersampled MR images into
accurate parametric maps for multi-component relaxation. A novel numerical Bloch-simulation based algorithm
is applied to precisely model the multi-component relaxation behavior to ensure accuracy, reliability, and
robustness in the deep learning training process. Generative adversarial network will be incorporated to further
enhance the reconstruction performance to ensure high-quality multi-component relaxation mapping at high
acceleration rates. This proposal will also explore new data augmentation approaches by using synthetic
image datasets to create a widely generalizable deep learning model. This ensures that the proposed deep
learning method can be applied to different relaxation types (e.g., T2, T1 and T1ρ) in many body regions, even
if limited training datasets are available. Our proposal includes two specific aims: (i) to develop model-based
deep learning method for rapid multi-component relaxometry, and (ii) to investigate the use of synthetic image
datasets for training deep learning model. The overall hypothesis is that the proposed reconstruction technique
can offer a unique opportunity to explore the acceleration of multi-component relaxometry by leveraging the
latest deep learning techniques, resulting in an accurate, efficient, and reliable model that can be widely
generalizable. Successful completion of the project will provide a clinically applicable multi-component
relaxometry technique for better studying, understanding, and staging diseases such as osteoarthritis and
multiple sclerosis. This concept could significantly advance quantitative MRI for clinical translation."

There are significant obstacles facing promising young physicians who are considering careers as clinician-
neuroscientists. Fostering the simultaneous development of research and clinical acumen during residency
training requires an intentional effort on the part of a training program and its associated faculty mentors. The
UT Southwestern Advancement of Neuroscience Research Careers (UT SWANS) program has been
developed to provide focused, dedicated, purposeful, and combined clinical and research training, mentorship,
and multidisciplinary resources to prepare clinicians-in-training for future careers as clinician-scientists. In the
initial funding cycle, UT SWANS was successful with its first trainees and now has a growing pipeline of
promising physician-neuroscientists. As detailed in our proposal, we have identified several definable
opportunities to enhance our program with this resubmission. Furthermore, with the appointment in the past 2
– 3 years of NIH-funded departmental chairs, the UT Southwestern Departments of Neurology and
Neurological Surgery have enhanced recruiting, mentoring, and academic training opportunities to take
advantage of the unique academic and research-training resources available at UT Southwestern. By
simultaneously offering outstanding clinical training at state-of-the-art facilities, a slate of 29 diverse, talented
and invested research and career mentors, and a collaborative neuroscience community, UT SWANS is
positioned to train clinician-neuroscientists who not only are capable of conducting outstanding clinically-
relevant research, but also achieving balance between academic and clinical demands. Our goal is to provide
a program that will catalyze the careers of clinician-neuroscientists who will be future leaders. Trainees will be
prepared to identify high impact research questions, conduct rigorous research, and achieve independent
funding. To achieve this overall goal, UT SWANS proposes to accomplish the following specific aims: (1)
Recruit clinician-neuroscientist trainees of outstanding potential in neurology and neurosurgery. (2) Foster a
culture of inquiry. (3) Cultivate and deliver outstanding research and career mentorship. (4) Provide
comprehensive training in neuroscience research methodology, research rigor, and responsible conduct of
research. (5) Ensure trainees conduct high-quality research. (6) Promote communication skills, including grant
writing and speaking. Likelihood of success is enhanced by our mPI structure, which provides complementary
and new scientific leadership from Drs. Louis (an accomplished neurologist-scientist and mentor) and
Pouratian (an accomplished neurosurgeon-scientist and mentor). The program draws on a diverse faculty
across multiple departments to provide broad opportunities to pursue research careers across numerous
disciplines. Finally, UT Southwestern is well positioned as an institution to accelerate training opportunities for
clinician-neuroscientists, having just completed a $1Billion drive to support the Peter O’Donnell Brain Institute,
which has committed additional resources for innovative multidisciplinary neuroscience research and training."

The Cardiology Division at Vanderbilt has a long and outstanding track record of training cardiovascular scientists
across a broad array of disciplines in cardiology. Over the last 5 years, the Division has experienced (1) major
growth in research funding, with >$20 million NIH funding last year ($1.4 million increase over previous year)
and over $28 million in total funding last year (26% increase); (2) success of our investigative faculty through
transdisciplinary collaboration; and (3) increase in trainees applying for/attaining K-series (or similar) funding.
We propose to continue this trend under a transdisciplinary Vanderbilt University Cardiovascular Medicine T32

to foster career development of cardiovascular investigators by training individuals from diverse backgrounds by
an accomplished, committed faculty. Vanderbilt houses unique resources central to the success of our trainees
and mentors, including (1) intense institutional commitment via divisional financial support and an NIH CTSA
(Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical/Translational Research [VICTR]) that centralizes mentor/trainee education and
wellness and guidance and support during K/R-series application (among many other services); (2) integrated
electronic health record/OMICS platform (“BioVU”, “Synthetic Derivative”) successfully used by our trainees in
research; (3) broad faculty interests across multiple areas of cardiovascular research, basic and clinical; (4)
training in leadership and integrity, including responsible conduct of research, with an emphasis on methodologic
rigor, reproducibility, and diversity/inclusion; among others. Our recruitment programs focus on our clinical
fellowship (with a “short-track” Harrison Society program for those dedicated to careers as physician-scientists)
as well as internal and external recruitment efforts, with dedicated programs and faculty roles for outreach to
women and individuals under-represented in cardiovascular science. We have demonstrated success in
recruitment/retention and attainment of career development funding to date. Training is mentor-supervised
research (>85%), supplemented by core didactics, conference series, and opportunities to develop leadership,
communication, and scientific training (including funding for formal Master’s training). Mentors are selected by
trainees prior to matriculation, with training (including a “mentor-in-training” program) to ensure mentor
development. A consistently updated Individualized Development Plan (IDP) and meetings with an Individualized
Primary Mentoring Committee and PD/PIs will help guide trainees to success and serve as quantitative metrics
to measure T32 effectiveness. Administration is led by 2 PD/PIs (Freedman; Shah), supported by an (1) External
Advisory Board and (2) Internal Executive and Steering Committees to guide trainee selection and provide
oversight. VUCM-T32 success is ensured by significant institutional support by Vanderbilt, via VICTR, Office of
Biomedical Research and Training, and Department of Medicine. We envision VUCM-T32 will provide trainees
expertise to sustain life-long investigation, starting with attainment of research-focused positions and funding."
10770488,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Many neurological and psychiatric disorders are essentially connectionist disorders: certain sets of neurons
have abnormally increased or decreased connectivity with other sets of neurons. Deep brain stimulation
(DBS) therapies target small, unique populations of axons and/or cell bodies in order to treat brain disorders
and normalize connectivity. Thus, mapping the wiring diagram of the brain is an important goal. Macroscale
connectivity has been studied indirectly in humans using noninvasive neuroimaging. In order to develop a
much higher resolution connectivity map of the brain, this project will develop depth-resolved polarized light
imaging to visualize axons and fiber tracts. Since brain imaging and mapping at microscopic resolution is
feasible with intrinsic optical contrasts (e.g. polarization-based) and depth-resolved block-face imaging is
desired before histological processing, we have developed the serial optical coherence scanner (SOCS) for
large-scale or whole brain imaging with microscopic resolution. SOCS combines a polarization-maintaining
fiber based polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography and a tissue slicer. This project will create a
novel SOCS system that can image axonal tracts at the micron scale spatial resolution using unbiased optical
contrasts (Aim 1). The approach will be evaluated, refined, and compared in the same brain tissue to neural
tract-tracer labeling of tracts associated with DBS targets for brain disorders, in nonhuman animal models
(Aim 2). The approach will then be applied to DBS targets in the human brain (Aim 3). The physical scales at
which this project investigates the brain microstructure are unique (1-10 μm resolution across centimeters of
tissue). This project will pave the way for the foundation of a future human connectome at the micron scale,
which is the highest resolution achievable with current optical technology for imaging an entire human brain."
10770794,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY – ALTERATION AND RENOVATION
 Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Nutrition and Women’s Health
As part of this the COBRE in Nutrition and Women’s Health, a new and unique Nutrition Analytics Core La-
boratory (NACL) will be created. This facility will operate as the hub for equipment and expertise that serve
various aspects of nutrition- and health-related analyses and approaches. The NACL will be a “one-stop-shop”
for faculty and students who wish to conduct nutrition and health research. The University of Idaho has com-
mitted substantial space for the NACL that will be improved by alterations and renovation. Our goal is to alter
and renovate several adjoining spaces in the University of Idaho’s Food Research Center that will constitute
the “hub” of the NACL. We will accomplish this goal through two aims: 1) Alter or renovate rooms in the Uni-
versity of Idaho’s Food Research Center to house the NACL that will be used by research project leaders
(RPLs), Pilot Project awardees, Technology Access Grant (TAG) recipients, and new and existing faculty and
students conducting research related to nutrition and women’s health, and 2) Delineate and justify all major
fixed equipment items requested for the renovated area. The NACL is innovative as it will eventually provide a
comprehensive facility that addresses nearly all aspects of data collection and analyses pertinent to nutrition
research. It spans the needs of scientists conducting basic biological experiments to those focused on social or
behavioral aspects of nutrition to those developing novel computational approaches to understand impacts of
nutrition on women’s health. Our approach is significant and impactful because it allows researchers (regard-
less of their fundamental primary research focus) unparalleled ability to study the broad range of nutrients,
physiological conditions, and health outcomes that encompass nutrition and women’s health."
10771303,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
As large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) rapidly identify associations with neurodevelopmental
and psychiatric traits, the major defining challenge of the post-GWAS era is to rigorously define the
neurobiological mechanisms underlying disease-associated genetic variation at scale. To this end, we and others
have recently developed methods to directly integrate GWAS results with large-scale tissue-specific expression
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) reference panels, enabling a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) – a
powerful approach to identify genes whose expression is associated with genetic risk for disease. In parallel,
emerging evidence has strongly implicated alternative splicing – a form of genetic regulation capable of
generating an exponential number of unique RNA transcript isoforms from a single gene – as an important
mechanism that exhibits dynamic patterns across development and is disrupted in the brains on individuals
affected by psychiatric diseases, including autism and schizophrenia. Yet, no studies have systematically
characterized the genetic regulation of isoform expression in human brain or its association with genetic risk for
psychiatric disorders. This proposal seeks to develop a novel, isoform-level TWAS approach (iso-TWAS) to
identify transcript-isoforms whose cis-regulated expression is associated with psychiatric disease risk. We will
compile a large-scale functional genomic reference panel incorporating genotype and isoform quantifications
from RNA-seq data of more than 3800 human brain samples, which we will leverage to perform iso-TWAS along
with traditional gene-level TWAS for a host of neuropsychiatric traits. We will directly integrate isoform
quantification uncertainties as well as probabilistic fine-mapping within our iso-TWAS framework, in order to
ensure the robustness of resulting associations. We hypothesize that isoform-level characterization will provide
substantially greater resolution to detect candidate biological mechanisms underlying psychiatric GWAS loci.
Finally, predicted SNP-isoform-disease associations will be experimentally validated using genome-engineering
in primary human neural progenitor cell (phNPC) lines followed by long-read RNA-sequencing and detailed
cellular phenotyping. Together, these studies will systematically characterize a critical, yet underexplored area
of genomic regulation in human brain, thereby providing novel insights into psychiatric disease mechanisms and
identifying potential neurobiological targets for therapeutic development and intervention."
10771308,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Substantial therapeutic advances have been made in NSCLC subsets harboring specific genomic alterations
and targetable with small molecule kinase inhibitors. Unfortunately, a similar strategy has been unsuccessful
for the ~30% of patients with mutated KRAS. Similarly, immune checkpoint inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis
provide durable response to ~20% of NSCLC patients, but the majority of patients do not benefit from this
single-agent approach. There is a knowledge gap about the regulation of MAPK pathway signaling in mutant
KRAS tumors, and the interplay between oncogenic signaling and the immunosuppressive microenvironment,
which translates into a major unmet therapeutic need.
 The members of our multidisciplinary team (Gibbons, Heymach, Wistuba, Draetta and Wang) have a
track record of productivity in studying KRAS mutant lung cancer and represent expertise in mouse modeling
of human lung cancer, clinical oncology, immunotherapy, molecular pathology of lung cancer, drug
development and bioinformatics. The Investigators have developed preliminary data from analysis of human
lung cancer specimens and preclinical Genetically Engineered Mouse Models (GEMMs) of KRAS mutant
NSCLC that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) status of tumor cells is critical to their therapeutic
response to MEK inhibitors, with the epithelial state producing profound sensitivity to MEK inhibitors and the
mesenchymal state producing resistance, even in mutant KRAS tumors. Further, we have published that the
microRNA-200-ZEB1 axis regulates EMT, the immune microenvironment of tumors and subsequent response
to immune checkpoint inhibitors.
 Based upon preliminary data, we hypothesize that: 1. Tumor cell EMT produces heterogeneity in KRAS
mutant tumors by suppressing MAPK pathway signaling, 2. The altered tumor immune microenvironment
resulting from tumor cell EMT confers targetable vulnerabilities to new immune therapies, 3. Combination
immune checkpoint inhibitors and signaling pathway inhibitors will provide an effective complementary
targeting strategy for mutant KRAS NSCLC. We will address these hypotheses by: i) evaluating the role of
EMT in de novo and acquired resistance to MEK inhibitors in preclinical models of lung adenocarcinoma, ii)
determining the effects of MEK inhibitors on the tumor immune microenvironment and testing the efficacy of
their combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors to enhance response in preclinical models of KRAS
mutant lung adenocarcinoma, and iii) characterizing the relationship of EMT to MAPK pathway activation in
human lung cancer samples, and the markers of sensitivity/resistance to combination anti-PD-L1/MEK inhibitor
treatment in clinical trial specimens."
10773818,"Asian Americans (including Indian Americans) comprise 6% of the U.S. population and represent the fastest
growing population group. The incidence of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease is higher among
racial/ethnic minorities, especially in first-generation immigrants. Immigrant populations spend a greater
proportion of their later years with cognitive impairment and dementia than native born U.S. populations. Yet,
there are few epidemiological and biological studies of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in immigrant
populations such as Indian Americans. In this first of its kind study, we propose to clinically and biologically
phenotype 400 older first-generation immigrants from the southern Indian state of Kerala residing in the tri-state
area (New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut) to better understand risk and protection against Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias in this fast-growing U.S. population segment. We also have an unique opportunity
to compare Kerala American first-generation immigrants with a native Kerala based cohort of 800 older adults in
our NIH funded Kerala-Einstein study. This cross-national study of a single racial/ethnic group from Kerala in
native and immigrant settings using the same protocols will reduce variability and enhance discovery of
Alzheimer’s disease and dementia mechanisms. We hypothesize that immigration related sociocultural factors
in older Kerala Americans will influence biological/vascular aging, which in turn will impact cognition.
Aim 1: Determine role of immigrant/cultural factors and social relationships (networks and support) that
contribute to Alzheimer’s disease and dementia risk in older Kerala Americans. Immigrant/cultural factors
include age at migration, residency duration, migration reasons, sex, education, acculturation, etc. Primary
outcome is global cognition (Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination: ACE). Secondary outcomes include
individual cognitive domains, mood (depressive symptoms, anxiety) and quality of life. To address the ‘healthy
migrant’ effect, we will examine coping and resilience mechanisms that may help preserve cognition.
Aim 2: Determine the contribution of immigrant/cultural factors and social relationships to biological
aging in older Kerala Americans. Biological aging is quantified using epigenetic clocks.
Aim 3: Determine the impact of immigrant/cultural factors and social relationships on vascular aging in
older Kerala Americans. Outcomes include cardiovascular (BP/ electrocardiogram) and cerebrovascular
disease indices (MRI small vessel disease). We will compare U.S. and Kerala cohorts on vascular aging.
Our proposal is very responsive to NOT-HL-23-001, which seek applications to understand health in Asian
Americans. Studying Kerala Americans can provide insights into risk and protection of Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias in other immigrant groups with high prevalence of cardiovascular disease."
10931750,"Project Summary/Abstract
Vector-borne disease surveillance requires monitoring the geographic distribution of infected vectors and is a
costly process that typically involves collecting vectors in the field and subsequently testing them for the presence
of various pathogens. These costs are often prohibitive to financially strained public health labs and local
municipalities, thus leaving the geographic distribution of many vector-borne diseases poorly understood. This
is especially true for emerging diseases and those with expanding geographical ranges. Firmly understanding
the spatial distribution of vectors infected with various pathogens is critical for healthcare providers who are using
potential exposure to guide diagnostic and treatment decisions. To provide these assessments, this project will
develop multiple cost-efficient vector-borne disease surveillance strategies, including both active and passive
strategies. The active strategy reduces cost by leveraging pool testing techniques; i.e., rather than testing vectors
one-by-one, multiple vectors are physically amalgamated to form a pooled specimen which is tested for the
pathogen of interest. These techniques have the potential to drastically reduce testing cost, especially for
surveillance efforts, but do so at the expense of a far more complicated data structure. To overcome this
complication, we will develop a novel suite of spatial and spatio-temporal regression models which can be used
to analyze pool testing data with an end goal of being able to better understand the geographic distribution and
expansion of various vector-borne diseases. The passive strategies will leverage existing information, as well as
data collected through this proposal, to develop ‘nowcasts’ of vector activity levels. These nowcasts will
assimilate climate and habitat suitability, weather patterns and other key environmental factors to forecast
activity, and therefore can be updated in real time without any associated cost. These nowcasts are intended to
supplement active surveillance efforts and field collection, especially in areas where large scale collection is not
feasible. To validate our surveillance strategies, we plan to undertake an ambitious study aimed at collecting and
testing ticks for spotted fever group Rickettsia along the expanding geographic range of A. maculatum (South
Carolina) and A. americanum (the Midwest). The data from this study will be used to validate and inform the
design of both our active and passive surveillance strategies. In summary, our proposal seeks to transform the
paradigm of vector-borne disease surveillance by reducing costs, improving accuracy, and quantifying risk in
real time, while elucidating the spatio-temporal patterns vector infection by spotted fever group Rickettsia
species."

Technologies to deliver macromolecules across the plasma membrane and bypass endosome degradation are
not only instrumental for elucidating gene function but also hold enormous potential for therapeutics. Proteins,
nucleic acids, and ribonucleoproteins (RNP) have become indispensable tools for biomedical research, however,
their applications in human therapeutics are largely limited to modulating targets reside in the extracellular space.
Only a few percent of exogenous macromolecules can get through the cellular barriers and make it into the
intracellular space. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly being explored as potential vehicles for
intracellular therapeutics delivery since they transport bioactive molecules natively between cells. Cell derived
EVs are heterogeneous in size and composition and, consequently, exhibit low specific activity for delivering
cargo of interest. To address these problems, we developed an innovative macromolecule delivery system
based on engineered extracellular vesicles called gectosomes (G protein ectosomes), designed to co-
encapsulate vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) with bioactive macromolecules via split GFP
complementation. The reversible tethering of cargo to VSV-G provides efficient cargo loading and endosomal
escape simultaneously. Gectosomes demonstrated efficient delivery of catalytic enzymes, interference RNA,
and Cas9 RNPs to the cytosol and nucleus and successful modifications of cellular phenotypes. We aim to
develop a versatile and broadly applicable platform technology that allows rapid production of highly specific
gectosomes capable of modulating intracellular targets in vitro and in vivo. The objective of this application is to
demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by improving the homogeneity of gectosomes through CRISPR
engineering of the producer cells and by creating gectosomes that deliver engineered nanobodies or ubiquitin
E3 ligase CRBN intracellularly to alter protein aggregation or degradation. We will also examine host immune
responses to gectosomes and elucidate the efficacy window of gectosome delivery in vivo, which will help refine
application areas. The feasibility of proposed studies is supported by our published results showing that active
loading of gectosomes reduces passive incorporation of cellular proteins while CRISPR engineering of producer
cells improves EV homogeneity. Three specific aims are: SA1: Develop new producer cell lines via CRISPR-
mediated cell engineering to improve the homogeneity and specificity of gectosomes; SA2: Develop gectosomes
to deliver antibodies or agents designed for promoting targeted protein degradation in cells, and SA3: Determine
adaptive immune responses to gectosomes and general toxicity profiles of gectosomes. The proposed studies
will overcome current limitations in delivering biologics to the intracellular space. The improved delivery platform
will also provide more accessible research tools for the wider scientific community in their endeavors to elucidate
gene function or develop new therapeutic strategies for treatment of human diseases."

10750972,"Project Summary (Core 1, Administrative Core, Sil)
 Our goal is to establish a vibrant and productive Coccidioidomycosis Collaboration Research Center
(CCRC) entitled Molecules and Pathways at the Coccidioides Host-Pathogen Interface. We are bringing
together a cadre of basic scientists, clinical investigators, and technologists who will interrogate the pathogenesis
of Coccidioides and the nuances of the host response in model systems, in chronic coccidiomycosis, and in
coccidioidal meningitis. Taken together, we will provide insights that will bridge gaps in diagnostics, therapeutics,
and potentially vaccine design for coccidioidomycosis.
 The Administrative Core is key to integrating the findings of each project, fostering synergy between our
groups, and recruiting junior investigators to the coccidioidomycosis field via the mentored Developmental
Research Program initiative. We will provide scientific, organizational, and administrative leadership as well as
financial oversight. Scientific progress will be fostered and evaluated by extensive review of data at quarterly
meetings attended by all of the CCRC members. In addition, we will have an annual in-person meeting for all
participants. All investigators affiliated with each project and core will evaluate the scientific progress of each
group and give constructive feedback that will support trainee development while fostering scientific excellence.
Additionally, if this CCRC is funded, we will establish an external scientific advisory board (SAB) comprised of
experts in basic mycology, microbiology, immunology of fungi, infectious disease, and host response. Thus we
expect a unique synergy between all elements of this proposal that will allow us to support both seasoned and
junior investigators in the Coccidioides field and make novel and critical contributions to diagnostic and
therapeutic strategies to combat coccidioidomycosis."

Core 3: Clinical and Diagnostics Core Co-Directors: (Thompson and Kenyon)
The Core 3 will provide infrastructure and assays to support interdisciplinary discovery and translational research
objectives proposed in the Projects of this application. The Core 3 resources will support the investigation of
immune and metabolic correlates of the spectrum of disease encountered in coccidioidomycosis and treatment
outcomes (Project 3). Through the collection of CSF and peripheral blood samples, Core 3 will provide samples
for investigating host transcriptomic response in disseminated Coccidioides (Project 2). Core 3 will support an
evaluation of the diagnostic potential of Coccidioides antigens identified in Projects 1 and 2 and host biomarkers
identified in Project 2.
The Specific Aims of the Core 3 are the following: (1) To develop Coccidioides patient sample repositories that
link to clinical patient information through unique databases that support discovery and translational research on
coccidioidomycosis. (2) To increase coccidioidomycosis research collaborations by leveraging resources
available through the UC Davis Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC), West Coast Metabolomics
Center (WCMC) and other technology cores.
In summary, Core 3 will play a critical role in supporting the research investigations for the Projects 1, 2 and 3
by providing well defined clinical samples from patients with Coccidioides infection. In collaboration with the
CTSC, Core 3 will provide clinical (deidentified) data and serological findings from the Coccidioidomycosis
Diagnostic laboratory. Thus, Core 3 will serve as an important source of the clinical samples including serum,
CSF and PBMC samples. Additionally, Core 3 will evaluate the diagnostic potential of Coccidioides antigens
identified in the Projects 1 and 2 and host biomarkers identified in Project 2. If these candidates show promise,
further studies will be performed through the Diagnostic laboratory so that these reagents can be advanced to
the clinic."
10750979,"Project 1 Summary: Virulence Gene Discovery in Coccidioides
 The focus of Project 1 is virulence gene discovery in Coccidioides. Despite the impact of Coccidioides
infection, the molecular understanding of virulence mechanisms in this fungus is limited. Only a handful of
Coccidioides genes have been implicated any virulence-relevant traits. Given the need to accelerate drug
discovery and resolve the public health crisis posed by this fungus in the endemic areas, it is imperative to dissect
virulence strategies used by Coccidioides to manipulate the host. Here we apply powerful systems-level tools to
identify virulence-relevant genes. Such a landmark discovery effort will help open up the field at long last,
providing a rich source of virulence genes to serve as new therapeutic targets.
 The ability of Coccidioides to cause disease depends on an elaborate developmental transition from
saprophytic soil form to host form. Specifically, the hyphal form of the organism produces arthroconidia, which
disperse easily and can be inhaled by mammalian hosts. Once inside the host lung, arthroconidia germinate,
enlarge, and undergo nuclear division and segmentation to form large spherules filled with vegetative
endospores. Rupture of the spherules allows release of endospores and dissemination of the fungus to other
sites. Here we bring together a powerful team of scientists with expertise in the basic biology of thermally
dimorphic fungi and statistical genetics, and in successful application of drug screens to target the growth and
development of microbial pathogens, including fungi. Given the critical role of spherule development in disease
progression, a major focus of this project is the genomic and genetic dissection of this process. We will identify
candidate genes that govern spherulation by taking advantage of three complementary approaches: (1)
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS); (2) high-resolution transcriptomics and proteomics of spherulation;
and (3) drug repurposing to identify chemicals that inhibit spherulation and/or fungal growth. Taken together,
these approaches will allow us to elucidate critical molecular events that take place during spherule development
in the context of infection as well as identify new candidate therapeutics."
10750983,"Project 2 Molecular and Cellular Analysis of Host Response to Coccidioides
Project Summary
 In project 2, we will apply sophisticated technologies to interrogate the host response to Coccidioides.
Coccidioides infections cause a broad range of disease outcomes ranging from subclinical infection to a
community-acquired pneumonia, to disseminated central nervous system disease. It has been postulated that
variation in the host response, including potential differences in innate and/or adaptive immune responses,
contributes to the spectrum of disease manifestations. The long-term goal of Project 2 is to apply transcriptomics,
mass cytometry, single-cell RNAseq, and phage display to analyze the molecular and cellular response to
Coccidioides infection using both in vitro infection models and patient samples.
 Our goal is to examine the host response in three critical areas that benefit from the expertise and
resources available to the investigators. We will establish a baseline profile of the macrophage response to
Coccidioides by comparing the transcriptional profile of these host cells to infection with either wild-type or
avirulent Coccidioides strains (the latter generated in the CRISPR and Virulence Core). To characterize and
compare the human response to chronic infection we will use mass cytometry and single-cell RNAseq to
interrogate lung nodules from Valley Fever patients in the endemic region of California. These studies would be
challenging for most investigators and are made possible here by the sophisticated infrastructure available at
the UCSF CoLabs (see letter of support). Additionally, we will take advantage of a rich set of clinical samples
(from UC Davis, Project 3 and Clinical and Diagnostics Core) to profile cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients
with disseminated coccidioidal meningitis. Additionally, to determine which elements of the host response can
be utilized for diagnostic applications, we will use high-resolution epitope-mapping technology to identify the
most immunogenic regions of the Coccidioides proteome. Notably this project will draw new investigators into
the coccidioidomycosis field. Taken together, we hope to amplify our understanding of the molecular and cellular
constituents of the host response to Coccidioides infection, providing a critical foundation for the development of
future diagnostics and therapeutics."
10750985,"Coccidioides infection leads to acute or chronic pulmonary disease (Valley Fever) with a wide spectrum
of disease severity. However, the mechanisms of coccidioidomycosis severity and therapeutic failures are not
fully elucidated and correlates of disseminated or unresolved infection are not well established. The overall
objective of Project 3 is to investigate the immune and metabolic correlates of Coccidioides infection and disease
spectrum and to identify mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. Our preliminary data of immune responses and
metabolomic profiles in samples from patients infected with Coccidioides identified the metabolic signature of
key dysregulated pathways. We hypothesize that Coccidioides infection-induced metabolic changes reflecting
the major dysregulated host cellular pathways can predict disease severity and clinical outcomes. We propose
to build on our collective strengths in coccidioidomycosis diagnostics and clinical care of large patient cohorts
with Coccidioides infection at UC Davis to determine the pathogenic mechanisms of coccidioidomycosis and to
investigate a prognostic biosignature that can identify the future course of disease progression. This project
leverages the availability of clinical sample collection from patients with coccidioidomycosis and database,
resources from the existing Centers, technical and scientific knowledge of immunological and metabolic
analyses, mouse models of coccidioidomycosis, strong preliminary data and a multi-disciplinary research team.
 There are three specific aims. Aim 1: To determine immune and metabolic correlates of the disease
spectrum and infection outcomes and identify pathways for therapeutic targeting. Longitudinal samples from
newly diagnosed patients with Coccidioides at UC Davis will be evaluated for immune and metabolic changes
and the key dysregulated cellular/metabolic pathways and correlates of disease outcomes will be identified. Aim
2: To identify immune and metabolic correlates of treatment failures and determine mechanisms contributing to
this treatment failure. Disseminated Coccidioides infection with severe disease is associated with
morbidity/mortality. Clinical samples from patients with disseminated Coccidioides receiving clinical care at UC
Davis will be enrolled in this prospective study. Aim 3: To investigate the pathogenic determinants of
Coccidioides that promote induction of immune and metabolic dysfunction and lung pathology in vivo. We will
utilize the mouse model of coccidioidomycosis to investigate the development of lung pathology, eosinophilia
and metabolic dysregulation by Coccidioides wild-type and mutant strains and map the pathogenic determinants.
An integrated analysis will be performed of host responses to Coccidioides in vivo through clinical (Project 3),
metabolic (Project 3) and transcriptomic (Project 2) data and to Coccidioides mutant strains in vitro and in the
mouse model (Core 3, Projects 1 and 2) Collectively, our proposed studies will (a) fill the gaps in our
understanding of the role of both pathogenic determinants and host factors contributing to the disease spectrum
of Valley Fever and (b) identify potential correlates of disease outcomes and targets for therapy."
10772561,"There is a significant prevalence of kidney diseases and hypertension in the United States, which is associated
with a tremendous economic burden. This coincides with a well-documented decline in the nephrology workforce,
leading to a critical shortage of nephrologist to care for the growing patient population, and a decrease in the
number of physician-scientists as well as percentage of NIH dollars committed to kidney-related research. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to enhance the training of a scientific and clinical workforce in nephrology
to meet the growing healthcare need of patients afflicted with kidney disease and/or hypertension. We will
accomplish this goal through three educational specific aims: 1) expose pre-clinical medical students early in
their career decision-making process to applied renal physiology research to demonstrate how basic science
discoveries can translate into meaningful patient outcomes; 2) establish a nephrology Learning Community (LC)
comprised of basic scientists, physician-scientists, and nephrologists who will provide structure and oversight of
enrichment activities and mentoring to promote interest in a career in nephrology; and 3) establish proficiency
conducting hypothesis-driven renal basic science and/or clinical research. The proposed program, named
Research and Education in Nephrology for Undergraduate Medical students – Florida (RENUM-FL), will
provide 12 rising second-year medical students with 10 weeks of hands-on research education in foundational
concepts of renal physiology and will establish a LC to foster engagement in nephrology for the duration of their
medical education. Participants will gain a deeper understanding of how the kidney maintains homeostasis,
engage in experimental methods to elucidate kidney function, and see first-hand how basic science and clinical
research translates to the patient bedside. We will introduce participants to role models in the field of nephrology
who will familiarize them to the life of a nephrologist and physician-scientist. The RENUM-FL program will consist
of a 1-week Fundamental Concepts in Renal Physiology didactic course comprised of 5 formal training modules
in applied renal physiology (glomerular function, tubular function, renal transport, implications of renal disease,
and acid-base & electrolyte disturbances in renal disease) and a 9-week immersive research experience where
participants will be matched with a mentor to conduct a kidney-related research project. The LC will include
activities such as clinical shadowing, journal club, biomedical ethics case discussions, seminars, work-in-
progress, career mentorship sessions that occur during the summer but also throughout the remainder of the
participants’ medical education. At the conclusion of the summer program, students will present their research
findings at the RENUM-FL Research Symposium. One of the main long-term outcomes is how many of the
RENUM-FL participants 1) entered a nephrology specialty, and/or 2) continued to engage is kidney research."

Understanding the nature of the molecular interactions involved in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-
1) replication continues to provide important insights into the fundamental nature of retrovirus replication. Beyond
the importance of such basic science investigations in addressing crucial knowledge gaps in the field, such
studies can inform antiretroviral target identification, and have broad applications towards therapy and cure. One
of the key aspects of HIV-1 replication that has remained underexplored has been virus particle assembly. The
reasons for this have included the challenges associated with the detailed behavior of Gag translocation to the
plasma membrane, the engagement of particle assembly sites, the molecular interactions that drive virus particle
assembly, and subsequent particle biogenesis and morphology. Integrative, comparative retrovirology has been
particularly informative in gaining a deeper understanding of these steps in retroviral replication. For instance,
immature particle morphology and the flexibility of the immature Gag lattice differs among retroviruses, which
have been insightful for understanding the role of gaps in the Gag lattice and its relationship to relieving stress
of lattice curvature. Furthermore, the recruitment pathways for retroviral Gag punctum formation, as well as the
role and nature of the actin cortex on assembly site selection and biogenesis also remain poorly understood
aspects of the retrovirus assembly pathway. In this application, we propose to investigate comparative analysis
of HIV particle morphology and particle biogenesis through innovative state-of-the-art experimental approaches.
In particular, we propose to employ cryo-electron microscopy/tomography (cryo-EM/ET), total internal reflection
fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM), dual-color z-scan imaging and
double helix-point spread function (DH-PSF) imaging to perform 3D super-resolution imaging and 3D single
particle tracking in living cells to investigate 1) high-resolution comparative structural analysis HIV particle
morphology and maturation, 2) investigate Gag puncta biogenesis at particle assembly sites, and 3) investigate
the role of the actin cortex as a physical barrier in human retrovirus particle assembly. These novel studies
harness innovative technologies in order to provide new insights into a highly significant yet poorly understood
aspect of the HIV-1 life cycle, address important knowledge gaps in the field, provide insights into potential
targets for therapeutic intervention, and inform efforts toward next-generation HIV therapies."
10936533,"Project Summary:
Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) replaces haploid meiotic chromosomes in metaphase (MII)-arrested
oocytes with diploid interphase chromatin from somatic cells. Such SCNT oocytes are diploid and are not suitable
for fertilization due to triploidy. However, our preliminary studies indicate that SCNT oocytes are capable of
forming premature meiotic spindles consisting of paired single-chromatid chromosomes and subsequent
activation or fertilization can induce segregation of somatic chromosomes into a pseudo polar body. Our research
will determine if somatic homolog pairing and recombination in mouse SCNT oocytes can be induced by DNA
double strand breaks and develop future therapeutic approaches for infertility treatments."
10771947,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most heritable human cancers, with inherited risk estimates of up to 60%;
however, the underlying inherited genetic architecture is still largely unexplained. Our unique access to a
collection of 446 blood specimens from 211 PCa families has enabled an innovative family-based approach to
identifying novel disease-susceptibility loci. To date, we have collected targeted sequencing data from a panel
of 48 “cancer risk genes” using samples from all of the PCa families, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) data
using samples from a subset of the PCa families. We identified 45 familial loss-of-function and missense
mutations in 32 DNA damage response and repair genes. Most of these gene products are known to participate
in homology-directed DNA repair (HDR), an error-free type of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. DSBs can
result from androgen receptor (AR)-induced transcriptional stress and increase cancer risk in androgen-
responsive tissues, such as the prostate. In response to androgen stimulation, both TOP2B topoisomerase and
LINE-1 endonuclease are recruited to active transcription sites and induce DSBs. Accumulated evidence
suggests that loss of HDR will promote other error-prone repair pathways, such as alternative non-homologous
end joining, causing mutation accumulation and genomic instability. The mutations we have identified are all
germline mutations, representing potential causal genetic factors. We therefore hypothesize that functional
deficiency in the HDR pathway, due to loss-of-function and missense mutations in HDR genes, contributes to
genomic instability and PCa. We have designed the following three specific aims to test our central hypothesis:
1) To determine the functional defects in DNA damage response and HDR caused by PCa-associated HDR
gene mutations; 2) To define the roles of nucleases EXO5 and EXD2 and helicases HFM1 and FANCM in
resecting DNA ends at AR-induced, TOP2B-linked DSBs for HDR in prostate cells; 3) To assess the biological
significance of AR signaling and the HDR pathway in PCa tumorigenesis. Our strong research team includes Dr.
Binghui Shen (contact PI, City of Hope [COH]) and Dr. Xiaochun Yu (mPI; COH), both experts in the fields of
DNA damage repair and cancer genetics, and recognized PCa biologists Dr. Zijie Sun (mPI; COH) and Dr. Ming-
Fong Lin (co-I; University of Nebraska Medical Center). We will test the role of HDR gene mutations as risk
factors for PCa and define the underlying molecular mechanism(s) linking HDR gene mutations to illegitimate
DNA repair and PCa development. Completion of the proposed work will significantly advance our understanding
of the role of HDR in cancer, especially PCa. We will use an innovative approach to identify novel PCa-associated
HDR defects based on familial inheritance and evaluation of both loss-of-function and missense mutations.
These insights will impact the field by increasing the availability of biomarkers for early diagnosis and providing
molecular targets for anti-cancer drug development."
10771959,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Prescription of opioids for treatment of pain has nearly quadrupled from 1999 to 2014 leading to an epidemic in
addiction and overdose deaths in the United States. Morphine and its synthetic and more potent counterpart,
fentanyl, bind to opioid receptors in the peripheral and central nervous system, producing feelings of sedation
and euphoria in addition to analgesia. Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) caused by the activation
of opioid receptors on neurons in the brainstem respiratory centers may lead to cardiorespiratory collapse and
ultimately death. Naloxone, a competitive opioid receptor antagonist used to treat opioid overdose, blocks the
effects of opioids but may cause rapid and severe opioid withdrawal, which is itself a medical emergency.
There is substantial inter-individual variation in response to opioids, resulting in variation in sensitivities to
opioid overdose and treatment responses. However, the collection of factors and underlying mechanisms that
determine the variable responses to opioids remain unknown. The long-term goal is to define the biological
basis of opioid overdose risk and to discover safe and effective novel reversal agents. The overall objective of
this proposal is to define the molecular mechanisms underlying individual variability in respiratory responses to
opioids that indicate specific sensitivities to opioids and pharmacological alternatives to naloxone. Preliminary
studies using the founders of the advanced, high-diversity mouse populations, the Collaborative Cross (CC)
and Diversity Outbred (DO), have revealed strain differences in opiate lethality and respiratory sensitivity
modeling the individual variability to OIRD in humans. The overall objective will be attained by pursuing three
specific aims: 1) Map genetic loci that underlie the variability in morphine and fentanyl sensitivity in the DO
mouse population; 2) Define the in depth physiological components of OIRD in CC mice using PiezoSleep and
plethysmography; and 3) Define the mechanisms that underlie the variable response to morphine and fentanyl
by profiling the brainstem transcriptome in CC mice. Under the first aim, quantitative trait loci for survival time,
recovery time and depth or respiratory depression due to morphine or fentanyl treatment will be mapped in the
DO population. Under the second aim, comprehensive respiratory phenotyping will be performed in naïve,
morphine-treated and fentanyl-treated CC mice. Under the third aim, expression QTL in the CC mice will be
mapped, gene co-expression network modeling will be performed, and gene expression will be correlated with
phenotypic variation. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a new and substantive
departure from the status quo by using methods that enable unbiased discovery of new pathways and
mechanisms of opioid overdose vulnerability and remediation. The proposed study is significant because
understanding the mechanisms that underlie the variability in the respiratory response to opioids will address
the opioid crisis both through prediction of individuals in whom opioids are contraindicated due to overdose
vulnerability and through identification of targets for opioid receptor-independent reversal agent development."
10771960,"Overcoming metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy remains a major unmet need for colorectal cancer
(CRC), despite significant progress made in the molecular characterization and understanding of metastatic
CRC. RAS and BRAF mutations (occur in 50% and 10% of CRC patients, respectively) are known to have
worse overall prognosis and/or clinical outcome. However, no inhibitors, including those against RAS pathway
and BRAF mutation, are able to overcome CRC progression. Increased adipocytes and lipids associated with
obesity/diet that accumulate at tumor sites as in CRC are recognized as critical for cancer metastasis and
resistance to therapy. Although CD36 is well-documented as a lipid transporter that plays an important role in
initiating metastasis and therapy resistance, our preliminary studies indicate that CD36 is only partially
responsible for lipid uptake in CRC tumor cells. Moreover, MDR1, known for its function in pumping out drugs,
co-expresses with CD36 and plays a role in lipid uptake into metastatic initiating/chemo-resistant CRC cells.
The nature of lipid species transported by CD36 and MDR1 critical for initiating metastasis and resistance to
apoptosis is unknown. We therefore propose to (1) determine the specific roles of MDR1 and CD36 as fatty
acid receptors and elucidate the oncogenic lipids they transport in mediating tumor metastasis in CRC; (2)
investigate how excess lipids fail to cause lipotoxicity while promoting metastasis and resistance to apoptosis
of CRC cells with RAS and BRAF mutations. Our published data demonstrate that STAT3 upregulates fatty
acid oxidation (FAO), leading to increased cancer cell stemness, which is important for metastasis and drug
resistance. We further demonstrated in preliminary data that extra acetyl-CoAs, generated by increased FAO,
activate STAT3 by acetylation, which in turn upregulates Acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSL), supporting lipid
catabolism and phospholipid biogenesis. We will test the hypothesis that the fatty acid receptors, CD36 and
MDR1, mitigate lipotoxicity and resist apoptosis through enhanced phospholipid biosynthesis and heightened
mitochondrial integrity. Our preliminary data are indicative that acetylated STAT3 is critical for metabolizing
excess lipids and for fatty acids-mediated resistance of CD36+MDR1+ CRC cells to apoptosis by increasing
mitochondrial membrane potential, which will be further validated in Aim 2. We therefore propose to (3)
validate acetylated-STAT3 as a target for controlling CRC metastasis and chemo-resistance in highly
metastatic CRC xenografts and in metastatic patient-derived xenografts (contain either RAS or BRAF
mutations). To this effect we will utilize our newly developed cell-penetrating acetylated-STAT3 decoy peptide
that effectively and specifically targets activated (acetylated) STAT3. Our proposed studies will provide
mechanistic insights into tumor progression mediated by increased lipids in the tumor microenvironment. They
may also lead to more effective therapeutic interventions for CRC with various genetic mutations."
10771975,"SUMMARY
Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) is one of the most prevalent myopathies affecting
males and females of all ages, and currently there is no cure or therapeutic intervention available. The
long-term goal of this project is to determine the epigenetic mechanisms leading to pathogenic gene
expression in FSHD, and identify regulatory components that are viable targets for therapeutic
development. FSHD is a complex genetic and epigenetic disease caused by chromatin relaxation of
the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat array at chromosome 4q35, which leads to aberrant expression of the
DUX4 gene from the distal-most repeat unit. The DUX4 protein, in turn, activates a host of genes
normally expressed in early development, which cause pathology when mis-expressed in adult
skeletal muscle. This established model of FSHD pathogenesis has stimulated the search for DUX4-
based therapeutic targets, including approaches to block DUX4 expression. While normal
mechanisms of D4Z4 repression have been well-characterized, very little is known about the factors
and pathways responsible for facilitating aberrant activation of DUX4. Previously, we showed that the
degree and stability of epigenetic dysregulation at the FSHD-associated 4q35 locus is the key
determinant for DUX4 expression, clinical presentation, and severity of FSHD pathology. Thus,
targeting epigenetic dysregulation in FSHD is a potentially powerful therapeutic avenue. Such an
approach would be greatly aided by a better understanding of the factors facilitating DUX4
expression, each of which represents a potential target for therapeutic inhibition. In a candidate-based
screen, we identified several epigenetic regulators with druggable domains that function as novel
activators of DUX4. Here, we will characterize these epigenetic facilitators of DUX4 expression and
validate their potential as therapeutic targets in FSHD. We will determine the global effects of
reducing the expression of these factors on skeletal muscle health and development using primary
patient cells and novel animal models. Finally, we will test the translational potential of inhibiting these
DUX4 regulators in an FSHD human xenograft mouse model derived from FSHD patient myoblasts
with their endogenous D4Z4 arrays. DUX4 regulators will be inhibited by CRISPR inhibition and
assayed for specificity. Successful completion of this project will provide key insights into the
mechanisms of epigenetic dysregulation in FSHD and validate the translational potential of novel
therapeutic targets in vivo."
10772083,"Cancer development, tumor formation, progression, invasion and metastasis all involve selective mRNA
translation but much of the understanding by which oncogenic translation occurs remains to be characterized.
We recently discovered a new mechanism of cap-dependent mRNA translation that established a new paradigm
for translational regulation, in that it is cap-dependent but does not involve the canonical pre-initiation machinery.
We showed that the canonical eIF4E/eIF4GIfactors are not required for approximately 20% of mRNAs that use
the translation initiation complex known as DAP5/eIF3d, which utilizes the cap binding activity of translation
initiation factor eIF3d rather than eIF4E and eIF4GI homolog, DAP5. We found that DAP5/eIF3d is essential for
breast cancer metastasis in animal models and strongly associated with human breast cancer metastasis. Here
we propose to study the role of DAP5/eIF3d-mediated mRNA translation in breast cancer development and
metastasis. We will determine the roles of DAP5/eIF3d-mediated mRNA translation in tumor development,
invasion and metastasis, using syngeneic mouse mammary cancer models, human xenotransplant breast
cancer cell line models and a heterogeneous patient derived xenograft model, the latter two models carried out
in immune impaired mice. We will characterize the requirement for DAP5/eIF3d versus eIF4GI/eIF4E initiation
of translation on cancer cell epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), stromal tissue invasion, vascular
intravasation, extravasation, migration, prevention of apoptosis resulting from cell detachment and migration,
and colonization. Other studies will characterize by genome-wide trancriptomic and translatomic analyses the
mRNAs selectively translated by DAP5/eIF3d and required for progression to metastasis, compared to mRNAs
translated by eIF4E/eIF4GI in animal models. These studies will further our understanding of the role of DAP5-
selective mRNA translation in driving specific oncogenic pathways involved in metastatic tumor progression. We
will also test the importance of specific DAP5 mRNA translation targets in DAP5-mediated metastatic tumor
progression. Finally, studies will be carried out to understand the mechanism(s) for DAP5/eIF3d-mediated
selective mRNA translation. Studies will focus on the role of a specific form of mRNA modification by methylation
known as m6A because we have found strong preliminary data in support of its importance."

Background: Sleep disturbances, particularly insomnia, are prevalent in cancer patients
undergoing chemotherapy. Our clinically based Brief Behavioral Therapy for Cancer-Related
Insomnia (BBT-CI) is a new approach for treating insomnia symptoms during cancer care and
can serve as a model for other behavioral interventions during medical treatment. Our design
allows us to capture patients just as they are developing insomnia symptoms, but before their
problems become chronic and require more intensive intervention. Our behavioral intervention
is innovative because we can deliver it in tandem with patients’ biomedical treatments, at the
bedside, which significantly reduces patient burden. BBT-CI is a brief (2 face-to-face meetings,
four 15-minute phone calls), feasible and acceptable intervention that has shown promise in
reducing insomnia and other cancer-related side effects and in improving circadian rhythms at
four community oncology clinic sites.
Methods: The proposed project will test the efficacy of a novel BBT-CI in multiple private
practice clinical oncology settings (n=20) across the country through the University of Rochester
Cancer Center NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP). We propose to
randomize 400 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy to either BBT-CI or Healthy EAting
Education Learning for healthy sleep (HEAL). Our HEAL control condition has been tested in
our preliminary trial and is matched to BBT-CI for time and attention while excluding active
components of the BBT-CI intervention (i.e., stimulus control, physical activity, circadian
entrainment). The proposed innovative study will: 1) test the efficacy of a novel BBT-CI
intervention in a community setting (NCORP network), 2) train nurses and clinical assistants to
deliver the intervention in the infusion clinic, making it easier to disseminate in the future, and 3)
elucidate the psychophysiology of insomnia and treatment response by collecting physiological
circadian and autonomic nervous system markers. The proposed study aims to change the
paradigm of how behavioral treatments can be delivered by creating and delivering the
intervention in tandem with acute cancer care."
10772134,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Pathologic dysregulation of the coagulation system is a major contributor to human morbidity and
mortality, resulting in either excessive bleeding or clotting. Significant progress has been made in the
identification of genetic regulators of the coagulation cascade, but many unknown modifier genes contribute to
the variable disease severity and penetrance observed among patients and families with hemostatic and
thrombotic disorders. Understanding such modifiers could help classify patients at higher risk for pathology as
well as identify novel therapeutic targets. Although major improvements to treatment of hemorrhagic and
bleeding disorders have been made with blood products and human derived or recombinant coagulation
factors, these have limited shelf life and storage conditions, and require intravenous infusion. Anticoagulation
has seen a surge in recent years with many new direct acting oral anticoagulants, but their mechanisms of
action are limited to the coagulation cascade. Building on our previous work, this project will take advantage of
powerful genetic tools, including genome editing nucleases, next generation sequencing, and the zebrafish.
We will conduct a large scale interrogation of the genome to discover hemostasis regulatory genes with the
potential to modify the severity of human coagulation disorders. We have developed a panel of clotting factor
mutant zebrafish using robust genome editing nucleases (TALENS and CRISPR/Cas) and conducted chemical
mutagenesis experiments that have identified potential suppressor mutant lines harboring prospective
thrombosis and hemostasis modifier genes. This panel of mutant fish will also be used for unbiased assays to
identify novel lead molecules that suppress hemorrhage or thrombosis. The approaches described in this
proposal will lead to the identification of the key non-canonical factors regulating hemostasis and
thrombopoiesis, some of which will likely prove to be important genetic modifying factors in humans, or will
suggest novel species-specific but biologically insightful regulatory mechanisms. This will shed light on the
regulatory mechanisms of hemostasis, and the modifiers will also be candidate diagnostic and therapeutic
targets for human thrombotic and hemorrhagic diseases. These targets will be utilized to develop potential
innovative agents and new therapeutic classes for treatment of hemorrhage and thrombosis that could benefit
the general population, as well as patients with bleeding and thrombotic disorders."

A critical step in the success of adoptive cell transfer (ACT) T cell immunotherapy in solid cancers is achieving
trafficking and persistence of T cells at tumor sites, while avoiding toxicities due to T cell attack of off-target
tissues and organs. Non-invasive quantitative imaging would be a powerful tool to understand mechanisms of
action and failure of T cell immunotherapies, evaluate the impact of T cell modifications and delivery routes,
monitor off-target T cell accumulation, and stratify response to therapy on the basis of measures of T cell tumor
accumulation. This Bioengineering Research Grant project will pioneer non-invasive and quantitative tracking of
adoptive T cell cancer immunotherapy using magnetic particle imaging (MPI), a new molecular imaging modality
that enables non-invasive, unambiguous, and tomographic analysis of the whole-body distribution of
superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). Preliminary results demonstrate non-invasive
quantitative tracking of ACT T cells in solid intracranial tumors, synthesis of tracers with enhanced MPI sensitivity,
and current sensitivity of 5x103 T cells. The proposed work aims to improve sensitivity to 5x102 T cells and
demonstrate the accuracy of MPI in quantifying T cell biodistribution in mouse models of cancer. Modeling of
MPI physics by the PI demonstrates that tracers optimal for MPI must have uniform physical and magnetic
properties and low magnetocrystalline anisotropy, to enable fast dipole switching at large SPION diameters. The
PI has developed a new synthesis that yields defect-free SPIONs with uniform magnetic properties and low
magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The proposed work (Aim 1) will couple this new synthesis with modeling of MPI
physics and comprehensive physical and magnetic characterization to gain fundamental understanding of the
relation between SPION properties and MPI performance and to obtain SPIONs with superior sensitivity. Imaging
approaches to track T cells must not compromise their viability or function and T cells pose unique challenges
for nanoparticle labeling. The proposed work (Aim 2) will define an upper limit for labeling primary T cells with
MPI tracers without compromising viability or function using tracers that associate with T cells through charge
interactions. Preliminary studies demonstrate non-invasive tracking of T cell biodistribution in mice using MPI,
and that SPION-labeled T cells reach solid tumors after systemic administration in murine models. The proposed
work (Aim 3) will validate in vivo tracking of ACT T cell therapy using MPI against T cell counting using flow
cytometry and will evaluate dynamics of T cell accumulation in tumors longitudinally using MPI. The proposed
biomaterials-development research plan is enabled by the complementary expertise of the PI (SPIONs and MPI
physics) and Co-I (ACT T cell therapies) and access to state-of-the-art instrumentation to characterize SPION
MPI performance ex vivo and in vivo. Achieving the target sensitivity of 5x102 T cells will provide an order-of-
magnitude improvement in quantitative cell tracking sensitivity over other whole body quantitative imaging
technologies, establishing MPI as a powerful tool in the immunoimaging toolbox."

Alpha-thalassemia is one of the most common monogenic diseases in the world; while the carrier
frequency is highest in those with South East Asian heritage, there is an expanding health burden in
the US due to immigration patterns. Although the most severe form of disease, α-thalassemia major
(ATM, in which all four alpha-globin genes are deleted), was formerly often lethal in utero, numerous
patients are now surviving to birth after intrauterine blood transfusions, often with excellent neurologic
outcomes. However, these patients have a severe chronic disease that requires monthly transfusions
or a stem cell transplantation after birth. Patients with a three-gene mutation (such as those with
Hemoglobin H-Constant Spring, HbH-CS) can also have severe disease requiring chronic transfusions.
While several gene therapy treatments have been developed for patients with β-thalassemia, there are
no such therapies for patients with the most severe forms of α-thalassemia, indicating a major unmet
medical need. Due to the similarity to β-thalassemia—lack of functional hemoglobin tetramers and
formation of toxic globin aggregates in absence of the corresponding binding partner—we believe we
can adapt gene therapy strategies that have successfully corrected β-thalassemia in the clinic into
analogous approaches for correction of α-thalassemia. These strategies include: 1) CRISPR/AAV-
mediated genome editing to replace a copy of β-globin with an α-globin transgene (Aim 1, conducted
by Drs. Matthew Porteus and Kyle Cromer at Stanford); 2) Lentiviral delivery of an α-globin cassette
with erythroid-specific expression (Aim 2, conducted by Dr. Donald Kohn at UCLA); and 3) CRISPR-
mediated de-repression of ζ-globin, the embryonic precursor to α-globin (Aim 3, conducted by Drs.
Tippi MacKenzie and Bruce Conklin at UCSF). Our multi-institutional team has been actively
collaborating to develop these strategies and the preliminary data presented in this grant. All three
independent strategies will be developed in vitro and assessed based on their ability to normalize the
globin chain imbalance and restore functional hemoglobin tetramers to α-thalassemia-derived HSCs
(obtained from patients with ATM and HbH-CS cared for at UCSF). Furthermore, primary and
secondary mouse transplantation experiments will be performed to ensure that edited HSCs retain their
ability to engraft and reconstitute hematopoietic lineages in vivo. The expected outcome of the
proposed work is a significant advancement toward a universal cure for α-thalassemia by generating
substantial pre-clinical data (for one or more approaches) that may be developed into an IND with the
FDA for an innovative first-in-human phase I/II clinical trial for ex vivo correction of this disease."

The unique characteristics of the training needed for today’s biomedical engineers to face complex and cross-
disciplinary problems impart difficulties in curriculum design. The need to accommodate a sufficiently strong
background in foundational science and engineering as well as the diverse areas of biomedical engineering often
results in a full set of technically-heavy didactic courses with little opportunity for experiential training prior to the
capstone senior design course. As a result of the lack of practical experience, biomedical engineering graduates
entering the workforce may struggle due to under-developed soft skills, critical thinking, or the clinical mindset
needed to succeed in a professional biomedical team setting. To address this need, we propose to enhance our
curriculum by facilitating earlier exposure to hands-on team based design and experiential learning in clinical
and industry relevant practice. We will specifically implement new components of a team service-learning design
course at the sophomore level, a summer clinical immersion program with local hospitals and emergency medical
services at the junior level, and a team-centered workshop led by local industry experts on the translation and
commercialization of medical devices to augment the senior design experience. Providing students with needs-
based service-learning design projects will prepare them in developing technologies that will not only address
public health concerns but also be welcomed by the community and enhance their understanding of the
importance of engineering in service to society. Building upon this through new partnerships in the proposed
program for clinical immersion, students will gain proficiency in identifying and evaluating unmet clinical needs
as well as gain meaningful perspectives related to human factors and expectations for design of a quality medical
device. Students will also benefit from a design team-centered workshop series that will be led by local industry
experts through activities that will improve their understanding of the industry-relevant practices for development,
and how to navigate the regulatory approval processes to translate and commercialize their senior design
technologies. Through this three-tiered enhancement to our program that takes students through the complete
progression from needs finding to commercialization, students will gain the practical experience early on and
repeatedly throughout their undergraduate studies. By strengthen their skills spanning engineering, medicine,
and business this program will help our graduates meet the needs of the biomedical workforce and serve as the
next generation of entrepreneurs in the biomedical industry."

Lupus is a chronic, often debilitating autoimmune disease that predominantly affects young women. Damage to
the kidneys (lupus nephritis) is a serious and common complication of lupus, affecting approximately 50% of
patients, and has been linked with poor patient prognosis and increased risk of premature death. Current
treatments for lupus are based on suppressing the immune system and inflammation. Unfortunately, these
treatments, which include corticosteroids, have serious side effects and in many patients do not adequately
protect the kidneys, highlighting the need for new treatment approaches. Iron is an important component of the
body, but when present in excess can cause damage to cells. Evidence suggests that iron metabolism may be
abnormal in the kidneys of lupus patients, with a growing body of literature indicating that several iron
metabolism proteins can serve as urinary biomarkers of lupus nephritis. Our published report demonstrates
that iron accumulation is increased in the kidneys and that reducing body iron levels helps to protect the
kidneys from developing injury in a mouse model of lupus nephritis. This proposal investigates the
mechanisms by which iron promotes kidney injury in lupus, with our goal being to specifically block these
damaging effects while maintaining normal iron homeostasis. Specifically, we propose that in lupus nephritis,
enhanced filtration of iron sources, including transferrin, leads to glomerular and tubular injury including iron-
induced cell death (ferroptosis), contributing to the progression of kidney injury in lupus nephritis. Ferroptosis is
a recently described form of cell death and has never been studied or targeted in lupus. Our preliminary data
show that one of the key mediators of ferroptosis, the enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member
4 (ACSL4), is dramatically upregulated in glomeruli and renal tubules around the onset of albuminuria in mice
with lupus, with further increases evident as injury progresses. We will conduct experiments in genetic and
inducible mouse models of lupus nephritis to test the role of iron and ACSL4 in promoting both glomerular and
tubular injury in lupus nephritis, and whether drugs targeting iron accumulation or players in the ferroptotic
pathway can stop further progression of renal injury. Together, these experiments will provide important novel
insights into the disease mechanisms underlying the progression of renal injury in lupus, and offer potential
new therapeutic approaches to treating lupus nephritis."

Approximately 12.4% of patients >75 years of age have aortic stenosis (AS) and 3.4% have severe AS.
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a safe and effective therapeutic option for
patients with symptomatic severe AS. More than 50,000 TAVRs are now performed annually across >500
hospitals in the United States (US). Despite stringent patient selection criteria and standardized procedural
techniques, there remains significant hospital variation in outcomes, including mortality, morbidity, and
readmissions, following TAVR in the US. However, the reasons underlying hospital variation in TAVR
outcomes remain poorly understood. Identifying organizational practices and processes of care associated with
better outcomes is critical to improve the overall outcomes of patients undergoing TAVR. The overarching
objective of this proposal is to perform a mixed methods study using a positive deviance approach to
understand determinants of hospital variation in TAVR outcomes and to identify modifiable practices
associated with improved outcomes. In Aim 1, we will use data from the Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry
to identify high- and low-performing TAVR hospitals based on variation in two key patient-centered outcomes
after TAVR – 30-day major adverse events (MAE, defined as a global ranked composite of mortality, stroke,
major/life-threatening bleeding, acute kidney injury stage 3, and moderate/severe paravalvular leak) and 30-
day readmissions. In Aim 2, we will conduct in-depth, semi-structured interviews of key clinical and
administrative staff involved in the care of TAVR patients in a representative sample of high- and low-
performing hospitals. The qualitative data will be analyzed to identify specific themes associated with high
performance, and to develop two distinct conceptual models of factors influencing MAE and readmissions,
respectively, after TAVR. This study will identify ‘best practices’ that can be adopted by low-performing and
new TAVR programs to improve their patient outcomes. Further, this research has the potential to identify clear
evidence-based structure and process measures that can inform guidelines and policies on evaluation of the
quality of TAVR and other transcatheter valve intervention programs. This research will be accomplished in the
setting of a comprehensive career development plan designed to provide Dr. Kolte, an early career
investigator, with the training and skills necessary to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming an
independent clinician-investigator with expertise in cardiovascular outcomes and mixed methods research in
the field of transcatheter heart valve interventions. An outstanding mentoring team and scientific advisory
committee of established investigators in the fields of valvular heart disease, outcomes research, quantitative
methods, and qualitative/mixed methods research will guide Dr. Kolte in his transition to independence over
the course of the award period."

the notochord, a conserved axial structure that provides developmental cues for the development of other organs
and serves as a structural scaffold for the embryo in all chordates. Importantly, in vertebrates, the notochord also
attracts osteoblast precursors that give rise to the vertebral bodies of the spine. The vertebrate notochord is
composed of a core of highly conserved vacuolated cells that is surrounded by a thick extracellular matrix that
acts as a corset for the notochord rod. Importantly, loss of notochord vacuole function has been shown to cause
defects in vertebral formation and spine morphology that resemble congenital scoliosis (CS) in humans. While
genetic and embryological evidence clearly showed that the structural role of the notochord is conserved,
whether vacuolated cells function in vertebral patterning in mice as shown in zebrafish is not known. Moreover,
following vertebral patterning, notochord vacuolated cells form the nucleus pulposus (NP) at the center of the
intervertebral disc (IVD), where they remain until adulthood. However, little is known about the function of
vacuolated cells within the IVD. Also not known are the mechanisms that regulate notochord vacuole biogenesis
and integrity and how these are linked to IVD degeneration during aging. The proposed studies will investigate
mechanisms regulating notochord vacuole biogenesis and function in zebrafish and mice and will investigate the
role of notochord vacuoles in spine formation in mice. Altogether, these studies will bring important new insights
into spine morphogenesis and the origin of pathologies such as CS and disc disease."

This project aims to explore the genetic component of cardiovascular diseases contributed by repeats in
human genomes. Cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of death in the US, have sizeable genetic
components which remain unexplained by association studies. Recent studies of coronary artery disease,
ischemic stroke, and atrial fibrillation explain less than a quarter of the heritability in these diseases observed in
family studies. The gap between observed and explained heritability has persisted despite large increases in
the sample sizes in genome-wide association studies. This ‘missing heritability’ hinders the understanding of
the genetic basis for cardiovascular disease, and the development of genetically-informed therapies.
A potential contributor to the missing heritability is structural variation in genomes, which is usually omitted
from association studies. Genetic association studies typically focus on single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs)—i.e., single base pair changes—and do not account for structural variants—i.e., mutations affecting
large stretches of the genome. Structural variants are difficult to resolve using short-read sequencing or array-
based genotyping technologies. While structural variants are rarer than SNPs, they are responsible for more
base pairs of variation per individual due to their large length.
The proposed research program will quantify and characterize the cardiovascular impact of variable number
tandem repeats (VNTRs), an understudied class of structural variants in which a specific nucleotide sequence
is repeated a varying number of times in different individuals. The human genome contains thousands of
VNTR regions, a few of which are already known to influence common diseases. The proposed research will
leverage existing genotyped cohorts consisting of hundreds of thousands of individuals to conduct a systematic
study of the role of VNTR length variation in cardiovascular diseases. These cohorts are genotyped using
arrays which do not directly assay VNTR lengths. The PI will develop statistical methods to impute VNTR
lengths into large cohorts, and characterize the contribution of VNTR variation to cardiovascular disease.
Additionally, the PI will refine the genetic architecture of Lipoprotein(a), a protein encoded by a gene with a
VNTR whose length is known to influence cardiovascular disease risk."

The intestinal mucosa has a rich immune microenvironment capable of responding rapidly to invading pathogens
while maintaining a regulated homeostatic state to commensal microbiota and dietary proteins. Tissue-resident
memory T cells are critical for immune homeostasis at mucosal surfaces based on their ability to rapidly respond
to invading pathogens. The CTLA-4 and PD-1 receptors inhibit T cell function and have become major
therapeutic targets for boosting T cell-mediated immunity in cancer patients. However, targeting of these
inhibitory receptors frequently induces inflammatory adverse events, and colitis is one of the most common and
severe inflammatory adverse events induced by checkpoint inhibition (CPI). We recently reported an in-depth
single cell analysis of immune cells in the mucosa of CPI colitis patients and healthy subjects. This analysis
demonstrated dramatic accumulation of CD8 T cell populations with highly proliferative and cytotoxic states in
all studied CPI colitis patients. We used the T cell receptor (TCR) sequences of CD8 T cells to investigate the
origin of these clonally expanded T cells. Interestingly, we discovered that a large fraction of colitis-associated
cytotoxic CD8 T cells had the same TCR sequences as tissue-resident memory CD8 T cells. We therefore
hypothesize that the CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibitory receptors hold tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm) in
check, and that loss of these inhibitory signals can induce massive clonal expansion of Trm, a major
step in the development of CPI colitis. Antibody blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 receptors in individuals with
immunologically normal mucosa thus provides insight into the physiological function of these receptors in
humans. In Aim 1, we will investigate how the CTLA-4 and PD-1 receptors regulate the function of Trm cells,
both in humans and murine models. We will investigate whether targeting of inflammatory pathways may revert
T cells from highly proliferative, cytotoxic states back into a Trm state by performing an in-depth single cell
analyses on colon biopsies from CPI colitis patients enrolled in a separately funded randomized phase 2 clinical
trial that evaluates TNFα blockade versus corticosteroids. Our single cell analysis demonstrated upregulated
TNF gene expression signatures in CPI colitis, and retrospective clinical data indicate that TNFα blockade is
efficacious in CPI colitis. We will also investigate this hypothesis in murine models by evaluating the impact of
CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies on the activation and cytotoxic states of CD8 T cells in the gut mucosa. In Aim 2
we will study the spatial interactions of T cell populations with immune, epithelial and stromal cells in the intestinal
mucosa using the CODEX technology that enables highly multiplexed immunofluorescence analysis of tissue
sections using panels of DNA-barcoded mAbs. This high-dimensional imaging approach affords an opportunity
to study the cell – cell interactions in the healthy gut mucosa and in CPI colitis, including biopsy specimens from
the clinical trial described in Aim 1. This project thus addresses a fundamental question is mucosal immunology.

10774306,"Cadherin clustering is a unique molecular process that mediates and controls cell-cell adhesion. In
addition, it also regulates the actin cytoskeleton, polarity, proliferation, and apparently other structures
and signaling pathways. Cadherin clusters reinforce weak individual adhesive bonds and generate
functional cell-cell adhesion links. By connecting to F-actin, they determine the overall organization
and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. Finally, they provide specific structural scaffolds for various
signaling pathways. Despite such incredibly important functions, which obviously play out in nearly
every aspect of tissue morphogenesis, the molecular mechanisms and regulation of cadherin
clustering remains to be studied. This proposal will shed light on how cadherin clusters form and how
they participate in such diverse array of cellular mechanisms.
The work done under this proposal in previous years showed that adherens junctions (AJs), the major
cell-cell adhesion structures in vertebrates, consist of numerous transient but highly adhesive
cadherin nanoclusters. The short lifetime of each cluster makes AJs adhesive and flexible at the same
time. The continuous generation of these clusters is apparently based on a remarkable reaction –
cooperative binding of the cadherin-associated protein α-catenin to actin filaments. The assembly-
disassembly cycles of both cadherin clusters and associated F-actin are tightly coupled thereby
synchronizing cadherin and actin dynamics in adjacent cells. Finally, we found that cadherin clusters
could be structurally diversified by cadherin/catenin-bound proteins. Diversification of cadherin
clustering is based on the fact that each of these proteins provides specific modes of lateral cadherin-
cadherin interactions. A variety of these interactions results in formation of an array of distinct clusters
each of which might have particular functions. The advances in understanding cadherin clustering
allow us to come up with this proposal, which includes: (i) the role of cadherin in clustering and
function of two proteins, signaling protein Erbin, and adaptor protein PLEKHA5; (ii) molecular
mechanisms interconnecting extracellular cadherin binding events with α-catenin-binding to F-actin;
and (iii) the role of cadherin clustering in some examples of tissue morphogenesis."

Advances in sequencing have greatly improved our capacity to discover the genetic causes of human diseases.
Many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and exome sequencing projects have uncovered thousands of
candidate genes linked to human diseases. However, how these genes contribute to disease pathology is still
unclear. Researchers use zebrafish to validate these candidate genes and identify pathologically relevant genes
to understand the pathophysiology better. CRISPR/Cas9 technology has significantly impacted functional
studies in zebrafish, enabling the generation of loss-of-function alleles. Gene knockout generation is efficient,
but point mutations remain challenging to create in a high-throughput manner. Understanding disease
pathophysiology through knockout alleles is informative but hypomorphic, and gain-of-function alleles require
advanced methods like CRISPR base editors. These tools are underutilized due to limited targeting coverage
and low efficiency, but expanding their coverage would benefit the research community. In the first aim, we will
use a knockout library of 80 mutants to develop a high-throughput phenotyping pipeline. Then in the second aim,
we will optimize and expand the targeting coverage of CRISPR-based base editors that can induce single
nucleotide changes in the genome in a targeted manner. We will then use the candidate genes and phenotype
data from the Aim 1 to test these base editors on a larger number of loci. These aims will generate 80 disease
models and robust base editing tools tested on a diverse set of genes. Completing these aims will result in 80
disease models and improved base editing tools that will be accessible to the research community via the
Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC)."

While opioid drugs are very effective for controlling pain, they are highly addictive. The current clinical decision
making for post-surgical opioid prescribing is still based on oversimplified information. Both opioid use disorder
and opioid-related pain response have strong genetic underpinnings. A better system is needed to guide the
clinical use of genotype data and facilitate better-informed opioid prescribing decision-making.
Electronic health record (EHR) offer a largely untapped source of information to conduct clinically oriented
studies. By integrating genomic data and EHR dataset in large-scale clinical Biobank, we can now perform
""clinical-driven genomic research"". This approach is particularly robust for complex diseases with a genetic
susceptibility.
I propose to develop a model to recommend optimal opioid dosage (oral morphine milligram equivalents) for
post-surgical pain relief and predict the risk of post-discharge harmful outcomes. The large-scale clinical and
genomic databases from the Mass General Brigham (MGB) healthcare system, including eight hospitals that
share a centralized database, will be utilized for model development. The proposed research will not only have
strong immediate potential to improve clinical practice in this urgent area but will also provide strong
preliminary work to support my first NIH R01 application.
From the previous projects, I have developed opioid use disorder clinical phenotypes and identified associated
genetic markers. I have also developed machine learning models to predict risks of complex diseases and
explored clinical application potentials. The proposed project will combine my existing analytical skills with the
newer expertise that I seek to develop through this award program, including a nuanced understanding of
analgesic strategies, addiction, and implementation of clinical decision support systems, as well as artificial
intelligence applications in healthcare system.
I have invited several established investigators to form a strong, multi-disciplinary mentorship team. They
include experts in the fields of addiction, pain management, genetic analysis, implementation methods and
artificial intelligence techniques. With their support, I intend to dedicate my longer-term research career to
study functional genomics in the fields of opioid addiction and pain by using integrated analysis of harmonized
big data. The K01 program outlined in this application will provide timely and strategic support for my continued
advancement towards those goals."
10764606,"Project Abstract
Chromatin looping is thought to play a critical role in gene regulation, human development, and response to
external stimuli by connecting regulatory loci with gene promoters. Most chromatin loops are thought to form
via loop extrusion; however, recent work has uncovered loops and other chromatin structures formed via phase
separation. How these loops form and how they impact gene transcription and other phenotypes remains
poorly understood in part because they have only been studied in a handful of contexts and in part because
we lack the adequate tools to study them. The goal of this research is to develop new computational and
experimental tools to study 3D chromatin structure and to apply these tools to understand the mechanisms
and impacts of phase separation-driven chromatin loops. We will map and characterize phase separation-
driven chromatin loops formed in response to various external stimuli (project 1). We will develop experimental
tools to manipulate these loops and apply them to explore their mechanisms of formation, quantify their
impact on gene transcription, and identify molecules that can disrupt them (project 2). And we will develop
computational tools that will enable robust analysis, interpretation, and visualization of these newly discovered
3D chromatin structures (project 3). The results of this research will determine both the scope and general
principles of phase separation-driven looping and provide new tools for the gene regulation community."
10885208,"HIV transmission continues in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), especially among key affected
populations (KAP) and in settings of high stigma and discrimination. In Malaysia, a LMIC in SE Asia, HIV
incidence and mortality is increasing. HIV is concentrated among KAPs, especially people who inject drugs
(PWID), a group that has substantially lower ART prescription and viral suppression (VS) levels relative to other
KAPs, undermining HIV treatment as prevention (TasP) goals. PWID are especially vulnerable to overlapping
and intersectional stigmas due to criminalization drug use and sex work, experiences with incarceration, social
class and the presence of HIV itself. Our preliminary studies confirm high levels of negative stereotypes,
prejudice and stigma toward PWID among medical students and HIV experts, with clear evidence of intention to
discriminate against PWID by withholding ART prescription. Stigma-reducing interventions have mostly centered
on educational and contact-based strategies. Such strategies, however, appear less effective where stereotypes
and stigma are deeply entrenched, as in Malaysia, thus requiring the introduction and testing of alternative
strategies. Behavioral design interventions are potentially effective ways to address stigma in such settings.
Behavioral design interventions use tools like framing, nudges, and choice architecture, which can be used to
re-design how physicians behave – or make non-discriminatory healthcare decisions. Rapid start antiretroviral
(RS-ART) is an evidence-based strategy to initiate ART immediately, thereby supporting TasP goals by reducing
time to VS, achieving VS and improving individual health. It has not been tested among PWID. It fits the criteria
for behavioral design interventions by re-arranging clinician decision-making by first focusing on eligibility criteria
(i.e., presence of opportunistic infections) rather than inaccurate perceptions of ART adherence or
deservedness. Behavioral design interventions have not been tested in HIV stigma research, nor has they been
assessed longitudinally or infusing clinically relevant dyads analyses of patients and clinicians. To guide the
behavioral design of RS-ART among PWID, we will use the Delphi method to develop guidelines. Then we will
use nominal group technique, a rank-ordering mixed method strategy to assess the multi-level barriers and
facilitators to RS-ART for PWID, in order to adapt existing RS-ART protocols for PWID. Once the new guideline
concordant RS-ART protocol is developed, we will pilot test it in 125 PWID over six months and conduct a
longitudinal dyadic analysis of patients and clinicians of stigma, physician trust and social support. The RS-ART
protocol will be refined further during pilot-testing to determine its utility as a stigma-reducing intervention that
can be tested in a future implementation trial. This proposal brings over 17 years of productive collaboration
between Yale and University of Malaya, with expertise in clinical HIV and addiction treatment, participation in
clinical guidelines development, mixed methods research, intervention development and refinement, multi-level
stigma assessment and intervention and dyadic analyses."
10909290,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The current lack of effective, targeted cancer therapies reflects a gap in knowledge surrounding the
mechanisms that promote tumorigenesis and emphasizes the need for new therapeutic approaches. For
decades, genetic drivers were thought to be the sole mechanism that promote tumorigenesis. Recent
advances have established epitranscriptomics, which details the regulatory and functional roles of RNA
modifications, as an emerging mechanism of tumorigenesis and potential therapeutic avenue. N6-
methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent modification on messenger RNA (mRNA) and serves key roles in
gene regulation and expression. However, our understanding of how mRNA m6A methylation contributes to
tumorigenesis is limited and warrants further investigation. The F99 phase of my proposal will determine the
novel role of ALKBH1, a member of the AlkB family of Fe2+/𝛼𝛼-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, in
regulating mRNA m6A methylation in arsenic-induced skin tumorigenicity. Chronic exposure to inorganic
arsenic through contaminated drinking water is a major carcinogenic driver of skin cancer. However, the
mechanisms that underlie arsenic-induced skin tumorigenicity remain poorly understood and few therapeutic
targets have been identified. I hypothesize that ALKBH1 promotes arsenic-induced skin tumorigenesis by
demethylating m6A on mRNA and regulating gene expression post-transcriptionally. The F99 phase of this
proposal will address critical gaps in knowledge surrounding the molecular mechanisms that underlie arsenic-
induced skin tumorigenicity and establish ALKBH1 and/or its targets as therapeutic targets for arsenic-induced
skin cancer. The K00 phase will address a broader question and profile the dynamic role of m6A methylation in
malignant transformation. Malignant transformation is a dynamic process. However, our understanding of the
mechanisms that drive malignant transformation is limited to static comparisons across non-transformed and
transformed cells and the transitional states that mediate the transformation between these cell types remain
uncharacterized. The K00 phase will address this gap in knowledge by using m6A-sequencing to longitudinally
profile the m6A-dependent epitranscriptome using validated models of in vitro transformation across a panel of
carcinomas. I hypothesize that the m6A-dependent epitranscriptome changes dynamically throughout
malignant transformation and that I will identify novel m6A-dependent targets that will increase our
understanding of the processes that underlie the transformation from a normal cell to a tumorigenic cell.
Successful completion of the F99 and K00 phases of this proposal will establish novel mechanisms of m6A
regulation and function and identify new therapeutic targets and potential biomarkers of cancer development.
My ultimate career goal is to become an independent investigator and run an interdisciplinary lab conducting
NIH-funded work that investigates the interplay between epitranscriptomics and cancer."
10873292,"The ability of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) to ‘bounce back’ after stimuli may indicate hemodynamic resilience, a property not reflected by resting BP or HR. Information on BP and HR resilience in humans is lacking. High-dimensional response-recovery curves (RRCs) for phasic beat-to-beat BP and HR data after perturbations can aid the formulation of dynamic indicators of resilience (DIORs). Thus, stochastic diurnal fluctuations in BP and HR may be DIORs reflecting micro-recoveries from small natural perturbations during daily activities (micro-stressors). RRCs for BP and HR after stimuli that evoke distinct hemodynamic responses (mental tasks, posture change, and exercise) may identify complementary DIORs that reflect risks of hypertension (HTN), BP-sensitive target organ damage (TOD), brain aging, impaired cognition and preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We hypothesize that: a. reduced hemodynamic resilience is associated with altered BP and HR responses to stressors marked by greater autocorrelation, increased variance and delayed recovery after a stimulus; b. BP and HR resilience metrics (DIORs) cluster within families and are influenced by antecedent trajectories of risk factors, arterial stiffness, prevalent target organ damage (TOD), brain aging, impaired cognition and preclinical AD, and subclinical atherosclerosis; c. DIORs of BP and HR will enhance prediction of adverse brain imaging, neurocognitive (including AD) and cardiovascular outcomes. We will test these hypotheses by measuring BP and HR responses to four standardized, graded and complementary stressors (mental stress [Stroop test], orthostasis; isotonic [handgrip] and isometric [3-minute walk] exercise) in 3374 participants in the third Generation (Gen3) and minority (Omni2) Framingham Study cohorts. Our aims are three-fold: Aim 1. Characterize the phasic beat-to-beat BP and HR responses to four optimally sequenced standardized perturbations in 3374 middle-aged Framingham Gen3/Omni2 participants at their fourth exam (2021-2024). We will plot dynamic RRCs for each stimulus and describe patterns by age, sex and cohort (white vs. minority). We will estimate DIORs, formulate age-specific reference limits and quantify their heritability. Aim 2. Evaluate the cross-sectional relations of BP and HR responses to the four standardized perturbations. We will relate RRC metrics and related DIORs, and binary BP responses to the following: CVD risk factors; renal function; longitudinal trajectories of resting BP and HR, arterial stiffness, and cardiac mass; subclinical atherosclerosis; prevalent BP-sensitive TOD including MRI brain aging indices; neurocognitive test scores, preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related disorders, and prevalent CVD. Aim 3. Relate RRC metrics for BP and HR to incident HTN, mild cognitive impairment, pre-clinical/prodromal AD, and CVD. We will identify a parsimonious set of incrementally predictive DIORs. In summary, we will characterize hemodynamic resilience and relate DIORs to brain aging traits, preclinical AD and CVD in a well phenotyped community-based cohort."
10861874,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal is to determine the role of fetal vs. adult wound healing programs – and the switch from
one to the other that occurs around birth – in the response to fetal/early neonatal extrahepatic bile duct injury,
such as occurs in biliary atresia (BA). BA is a rare disease occurring worldwide that it is thought to occur from a
prenatal environmental insult – affecting only the fetus – to the extrahepatic bile duct (EHBD). Babies appear
healthy at birth, but undergo rapid progression of the disease to fibrosis and obstruction of the duct and cirrhosis
of the liver. There are three major unanswered questions that motivate this proposal:
  Why does an EHBD insult during pregnancy affect only the fetus?
  Do some babies with fetal EHBD injury recover, and if yes, why recovery rather than fibrosis?
  Why does the disease progress so rapidly after birth?
Our preliminary data suggest that prenatal EHBD injury leads to a program of fetal wound healing in the initial
response of the fetal EHBD to injury. Fetal wound healing, which has been reported in multiple tissues, results
in regeneration rather than scarring and is particularly notable for the deposition of high molecular weight
hyaluronic acid (HA) rather than type I collagen, with a growth factor milieu that includes IL-10 rather than TGF-.
The switch from a fetal to an adult wound healing program occurs late in gestation.
We hypothesize that fetal and adult wound healing programs, in sequence, determine the response to fetal
EHBD injury; that both have the potential to enhance damage and injury progression; and that co-opting these
responses would have a major therapeutic benefit. We propose to test these hypotheses through 2 specific
aims that study wound healing in sequence from the fetus to the newborn, including the impact of natal stress
on the transitional program between fetal and adult: 1) Define the nature of fetal wound healing and its impact
on the injury response in the fetal EHBD; and 2) Determine the impact of birth-associated stress and the switch
to an adult wound healing program in the context of an HA-laden EHBD after the events of fetal wound healing.
The proposed work introduces a new concept – fetal wound healing – to the study of BA. Understanding fetal
wound healing in BA, both its positive and negative effects, will be essential in the development of potentially
transformative treatments."
10916437,"Environmental exposures profoundly shape lifespan health and disease trajectories. Preconception and pre-
perinatal exposure can permanently alter the developing brain and associated regulatory systems to increase
susceptibility to a host of diseases and developmental challenges. Protective and promotive environmental
factors can promote well-being, even amidst adversity. The ECHO Consortium of Cohort Study Sites, Cores,
and Centers is dedicated to mapping the impact of early exposures on child health and development. Good
science depends on good measurement. Our proposed ECHO Measurement Core will advise, orchestrate, and
frame the coordinated, sensitive measurement of exposures, developmental processes, and health outcomes
central to achieving ECHO's objective. We propose three aims. Aim 1 is to develop and refine measures for the
ECHO Cohort Protocol (ECP), including methods to implement the measures. We will lead efforts to optimize
the measurement of exposures and outcomes, mindful of best measurement practices as well as respondent
and staff burden. We will lead the timely development of a preconception section for the Protocol by drawing on
diverse expertise across the ECHO Network to ensure feasible, robust, and culturally sensitive assessment of
critical data elements in the preconception period that have direct import for the primary ECHO child health
outcomes (pre-, peri-, post-natal, airways, obesity, neurodevelopment, and positive health). We will leverage
novel psychometric and technological methods such as computer adaptive tests, wearable sensors, and other
innovations in remote assessment, to reduce barriers to study participation and enhance participant retention.
Aim 2 is to assist the ECHO Consortium in implementing and evaluating the ECP. We will further collaborate
with everyone in the Consortium to finalize the protocol and establish a standard implementation strategy that
can be implemented across the diverse Cohort Study Sites, including determining optimal study visit structure
and choreography, developing Manual(s) of Operating Procedures (MOPs), and creating, supporting, and, when
appropriate, leading training. Aim 3 is to lead strategic decision-making and operational strategies to incorporate
new and revised measures to advance ECHO Cohort science while minimizing participant and staff burden. We
propose to optimize measurement decisions by maintaining collaborative communication, rapidly deploying data
and biospecimen collection for time-sensitive needs, identifying and evaluating important measurement
developments, creating a technology pipeline for rapid adoption of innovative approaches to data collection, and
ensuring data collection strategies are validated for diverse populations. Our measurement science expertise
within and outside of ECHO, paired with our participant-centered approach, enables us to bridge reliable and
valid assessment with practical feasibility and ultimately allows us to bring ECHO scientists together toward our
shared goal of mapping the impact of early exposures on child health and development."
10745919,"Genomic and biochemical studies indicate the central role of ERK signaling as the key driver of
colorectal cancer (CRC) proliferation. Yet selective RAF/MEK/ERK pathway inhibitors have
been ineffective in the treatment of CRC thus far. We hypothesize that profound ERK inhibition
is required to suppress the growth of ERK activated tumors and that high basal receptor-driven
RAS activation in CRC causes rapid adaptive and acquired resistance to ERK inhibition that is
not overcome with current inhibitors due to their narrow therapeutic index. Additionally,
augmenting this high basal receptor-driven RAS activation could provide sufficient ERK
activation to stimulate tumor growth, providing a selective pressure for genomic alterations that
amplify upstream signaling in CRC. In this proposal, we will define the spectrum of genomic
alterations in CRC that amplify ERK signaling and could be targeted with ERK inhibition and will
functionally and biochemically characterize novel alterations in the RAF and MEK proteins. We
will devise strategies that profoundly inhibit ERK by co-targeting ERK activation and receptor re-
activation and by using novel combinations and dosing schedules that expand the therapeutic
index of ERK inhibition. We have shown that high receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling in
CRC has consequences for response to targeted therapies as (1) response rates to RAF plus
RTK (i.e., EGFR) inhibitors is better than for RAF inhibitors alone in patients with BRAF V600E
CRC, (2) wild-type RAS amplification, a recurrent mechanism of resistance to RAF inhibitor
combinations in CRC never detected in the large number of analyzed RAF inhibitor-resistant
melanomas, increases activated RAS in an RTK-dependent manner, and (3) low activity BRAF
mutants in CRC can act as oncogenes by increasing signal transduction from activated RAS
and amplifying EGFR signaling. This proposal will now apply an understanding of these specific
lineage properties to define the molecular profiles that depend on ERK signaling and devise
effective strategies to inhibit ERK signaling in CRC in the clinic. We believe these studies will
guide the development of new treatments for CRC and improve the outcomes of patients with
these tumors."
10840885,"The combined degeneration of both “lower” motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord and “upper”
motor neurons (UMNs) in the cerebral cortex is an important hallmark of ALS. Almost all cases of ALS are
eventually fatal, and the rapid progression of the disease makes it particularly terrible, with over 80% of
patients dying within five years of diagnosis. No cure exists for ALS and the only available treatments slow
disease progression by merely a few months. Therefore, a great need exists for more effective and specific
therapies that can stop or even reverse neurodegeneration. Innovation for such therapies will only arise from a
better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathological process, especially since most
genes linked to ALS are ubiquitously expressed yet only specific populations of cells degenerate.
Understanding why certain cells are uniquely vulnerable and mapping cell type specific pathways that are
dysregulated during disease are crucial milestones. This has posed a considerable challenge for the spinal
cord projecting UMNs since they are difficult to distinguish from other pyramidal cell types and are therefore
often overlooked in preclinical studies. Because of this, the basis for their selective vulnerability to ALS-causing
mutations has remained a mystery.
 The proposed study aims to overcome this by building on recent work that identified two highly similar
yet molecularly distinct subpopulations of projection neurons in layer 5b of motor cortex, where UMNs reside.
These populations have overlapping projections to pons, but non-overlapping projections to the spinal cord or
thalamus. Examining these cells in preclinical models of ALS revealed that the corticospinal projecting neurons
(CSTNs) were vulnerable to degeneration, while the corticopontine-only population (CPN) did not degenerate.
The selective vulnerability of the CSTNs was likely due to dysregulation of mitochondrial function since a
dramatic upregulation of genes related to oxidative phosphorylation and mitophagy was observed at
symptomatic stages of disease. Aim 1 of this grant will employ an integrative multi-omics approach to address
whether differences in the properties of mitochondria between CSTNs and CPNs drive differential responses to
disease using a novel, viral-based strategy to isolate cell type specific mitochondria during disease progression
in two preclinical ALS models, SOD1G93A and FUSP525L. Aim 2 focuses on dissecting the cellular role of
identified candidate genes that are enriched in CSTNs and cell type-specific bioenergetic pathways, linking
them to mitochondrial function and disease vulnerability. To increase the translational significance of this work,
Aim 3 will leverage novel markers for CSTNs and CPNs for a detailed anatomical analysis of postmortem
tissue from ALS patients to perform transcriptional profiling on cell type specific nuclei isolated by fluorescence
activated nuclear sorting (FANS) from postmortem patient tissue. Results from this study will yield novel
mechanisms underlying selective vulnerability of UMNs in ALS."
10759402,"Background: As many as 30% of the ~10 million Americans prescribed long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) are
estimated to misuse opioids. Receiving LTOT is associated with opioid-related harms, and misuse leads to an
increase in the dose consumed and other risky behavior, further worsening outcomes. However, there is a gap
in knowledge on how to identify and treat this patient population particularly when they do not meet diagnostic
criteria to be treated by medications for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). In recent years, guidelines from the
Centers for Disease Control and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have effected widespread tapering
to reduce misuse. Buprenorphine, a medication used for both pain and OUD, may also be effective in reducing
opioid-related harms while controlling pain for patients on LTOT with misuse; however, buprenorphine is yet to
be tested rigorously in this patient population. Therefore, studies are needed to identify patients on LTOT with
misuse and to compare the efficacy of different treatments on patient outcomes.
Significance: Chronic pain, LTOT for pain, and opioid misuse are common among Veterans and lead to
multiple health-related harms. The VHA has made improving pain care and reducing opioid harms a major
priority of clinical initiatives, and this proposal responds to the Health Services Research and Development
(HSR&D) Funding Announcement #HX-21-024 to address those opioid-related priorities. By filling a crucial
evidence gap, this proposal will significantly impact the way we treat pain and minimize harm for Veterans with
opioid misuse.
Innovation and Impact: This proposal is innovative and impactful in many ways. First, this project will utilize the
unique capabilities of the VHA’s Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) to develop a novel algorithm to identify
patients on LTOT with misuse. If successful, this automated identification process has the potential to be
scaled to VHA sites across the country. Second, the comparative effectiveness of different treatments will be
determined by an emulated trial, an innovative and efficient study design that can lead to greater
generalizability than standard trials, which suffer significantly from selection bias in this area. The treatments
being evaluated in the emulated trial are readily available, so if specific treatments are found to improve patient
symptoms and reduce adverse outcomes, it will be feasible for Veterans with opioid misuse to access these
treatments nationwide. Finally, we will gather feedback from providers and Veterans to understand the best
strategies and interventions to scale the identification process and better inform Veterans and providers of
evidence-based treatment options.
Specific Aims: This project aims to 1) Classify a cohort of patients on LTOT with opioid misuse but without
OUD by a) building on a previously developed augmented chart review methodology and b) applying an
algorithm to structured data; 2) Conduct an emulated trial to compare the effectiveness of pharmacologic
treatment options on patient-centered and patient safety outcomes; and 3) Understand current practices and
how to translate our findings into improved care via semi-structured interviews with providers and Veterans.
Methodology: The study population is VHA patients on LTOT with opioid misuse 2014-present. The proposal
uses mixed quantitative and qualitative methods including augmented structured chart review, large dataset
classification using ordinal elastic net regression, emulated trials, and qualitative interviews.
Next Steps/Implementation: We expect findings to be of use to VHA leaders, prescribing clinicians, and
patients with chronic pain. If successful, the automated identification process from Aim 1 could be scaled to
VHA sites, and if treatments evaluated in Aim 2 are effective in improving symptoms and reducing adverse
outcomes, these could also be implemented widely. In Aim 3, we will gather Veteran input on how to best
implement findings from Aims 1 and Aim 2 into clinical practice in a variety of settings."
10760316,"The University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) proposes to develop a new T32 training program that
will train predoctoral graduate students from groups that are underrepresented in biomedical
research to become successful scientists pursuing careers in the biomedical workforce.
Underrepresented (UR) groups include students from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds
(underrepresented minorities or URM) as well as students with disabilities. The mission of our
training program is to facilitate the transformation of our trainees into independent scientists who
are active producers of new biomedical knowledge and are adept at solving the complex
problems of disease and illnesses that adversely affect human health. To accomplish this
mission, we have established the following six objectives: Objective #1: To increase the
participation of UR students in the participating biomedical predoctoral programs from the
current level of 16% to 20%, such that our programs reflect the diversity of the state of
Missouri’s population. Objective #2: To improve the PhD completion rate of UR students in the
participating biomedical predoctoral programs from the current level of 84% to 90%, such that
UR students complete their PhD at the same rate as students from well-represented
backgrounds. Objective #3: To equip our trainees with the skills to communicate their science,
such that 30% of UR trainees in the participating programs are awarded external fellowships
during their predoctoral training. Objective #4: To increase the number of publications by our
trainees, such that our UR PhD graduates will publish, on average, 2 first-author papers while
contributing to, on average, 2 additional publications over the course of their doctoral training.
Objective #5: To strengthen the inclusive and supportive nature of our training environment, as
well as improve the mentoring skills of our faculty. Objective #6: To develop robust levels of
science self-efficacy, science identity, perceived supports, and satisfaction with mentoring
relationships among UR trainees, all of which are predictors of academic satisfaction and
persistence outcomes among students from UR backgrounds. The IMSD T32 program will
implement a wide-ranging set of programmatic activities to achieve the stated Objectives. The
programmatic activities, based on best practices for retention of students from UR backgrounds,
as described in the literature, will develop the technical, operational and professional skills
that will enable our trainees to flourish in their independent scientific careers."
10760319,"Epileptogenesis is a pathological process that transforms a normal brain into an epileptic brain, typically
initiated by genetic mutations and neurological insults such as status epilepticus (SE). There is an unmet need
to understand epileptogenesis because it remains nearly unpreventable. Brain inflammation triggered by
neuronal injury is increasingly recognized as a contributor to epileptogenesis. Microglia, generally considered
as resident macrophages, are highly proliferated and activated in response to epileptogenic insults and thought
to play a primary role. Besides resident microglia, other immune cells in the peripheral system and CNS
lymphatic system also infiltrate the CNS compartment and likely contribute to epileptogenesis. It remains to be
understood how CNS resident and non-resident immune cells interact in response to epileptogenic insults and
how the injury-triggered changes in the immune network impinge on non-immune cells such as astrocytes and
neurons, thereby contributing to epileptogenesis. This proposal is built on our observation that IL22Rα1 is
strongly up-regulated in astrocytes in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. This induction depends
on brain inflammation. Moreover, the induction of IL22Rα1 is critically involved in astrogliosis, an excessive
proliferation and activation of astrocytes frequently seen in epileptic brains. These findings lead to our central
hypothesis, that up-regulation of IL22/IL22Rα1 signaling promotes astrocyte proliferation, which in turn
contributes to epileptogenesis. Three specific aims are proposed to test our hypothesis. Aim 1 will determine
how IL22Rα1 expression is up-regulated in astrocytes. Aim 2 will elucidate how IL22-producing immune cells
are recruited into the CNS compartment. Aim 3 will determine if blocking IL22 signaling attenuates astrogliosis
and modifies the process of epileptogenesis. Our study will not only improve our understanding how IL22
signaling regulates epileptogenesis, but could also identify druggable targets to prevent epileptogenesis."
10760322,"Underrepresented-in-medicine (UIM) physician-neuroscientists, when compared with their representation in the US population, are inadequately represented among medical school faculty, are less likely to receive NIH research awards, and are less likely to be promoted likely due to significant cultural, societal, and financial pressures, as well as restricted access to role models and community support. A well trained and sustained workforce of URM faculty is essential to clinical neurosciences research because URM faculty are more likely to engage in research that affect increasingly diverse communities, help recruit minority individuals for participation in research; and contribute a disproportionate amount of effort to mentoring URM trainees and early career faculty. The Training in Research for Academic Neurologists to Sustain Careers and Enhance the Numbers of Diverse Scholars (TRANSCENDS) program is a collaborative initiative between the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). TRANSCENDS will offer a two-year innovative, evidence-based mentored learning experience to UIM clinical neuroscientists. The involvement of the AAN brings to this important effort, wide access to neurology disciplines, strong commitment to diversity, volunteer engagement from leaders in the field, worthwhile in-kind resources, and proven experience in implementing high impact programs. Focusing particularly on post-residency subspecialty fellows and early career faculty (no more than 3 years out of training) from among racial/ethnic minorities and individuals with disabilities, the specific aims of the program are: 1) To select and retain a group of highly promising diverse junior faculty or post-residency fellows from a national pool of applicants who are committed to pursuing research careers in the field of clinical neurosciences; 2) To increase mentees' knowledge, skills, and motivation to pursue academic careers through intensive research training (comprehensive online Master of Science in Clinical Research degree program and AAN annual meeting Diversity Poster Session); 3) To enhance mentoring benefits and networking opportunities for UIM Scholars (congruent one-on-one mentoring approach, AAN annual meeting mentoring and networking activities); 4) To evaluate the effectiveness of the Research Education Program. Measures for assessing Scholars' achievements will be monitored following program completion and will include position(s) held; number of presentations at professional meetings and peer-reviewed publications; leadership positions held in academia and public service; and funding for investigator-initiated research projects or career development awards. TRANSCENDS will address a critical deficiency in the academic workforce by mentoring UIM scholars to pursue independent careers in clinical neuroscience research. Successful execution of the program will establish a network of 24 well-trained URM neuroscientists, as well as a broader community of diverse clinical neuroscientists fully engaged in clinical neuroscience research, thereby expanding our collective capacity to reduce the burden of neurological diseases and build several next generations of UIM neurologists."
10760238,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic care models (CCM) that deliver evidence-based practices (EBP) by multidisciplinary provider teams
with primary care physicians (PCP) and behavioral health (BH) providers (as care managers, CM) have
improved BH outcomes in adults1-3 and children/teens, but their widespread application is impeded by
implementation barriers at multiple levels. As an example, our clinical trials document the benefits of a
simplified cross-diagnosis CCM protocol for child behavior problems and ADHD (Doctor Office Collaborative
Care; DOCC; MH064372), but DOCC requires targeted implementation support to enhance uptake and
address practical barriers at the care team (e.g., low coordination) and practice/leadership levels (e.g., low
priority). Further, meta-analyses suggest that science provides few answers for how to overcome such
obstacles as trials have not tested implementation strategies to scale-up a pediatric CCM. As a theory-based
implementation intervention, Facilitation delivered by an outside expert with providers/teams (external) or
practice manager/leaders (internal) has enhanced provider competency to deliver an EBP and leadership or
organizational-level commitment to EBP implementation. External facilitation strategies applied to a care team
(TEAM) may engage validated targets (i.e., team functioning), whereas internal facilitation strategies applied to
leaders (LEAD) may engage practice-level targets (i.e., implementation support) to enhance uptake. They may
interact to enhance EBP uptake and patient outcomes. This R01 application proposes a randomized, hybrid
type 3 effectiveness-implementation trial to: 1) test the main and interactive effects of TEAM and LEAD
facilitation augmentation on provider implementation and clinical outcomes, 2) test for target engagement and
mediation at the team and leadership levels, and 3) examine selected practice, provider, and family
moderators of implementation. The state-wide sample includes 24 primary care practices from the medical
home program of the American Academy of Pediatrics-Pennsylvania Chapter. After standard training in the
DOCC EBP, all practices will be randomized to one of four conditions: 1) No TEAM or LEAD; 2) TEAM only; 3)
LEAD only, and 4) TEAM+LEAD. TEAM and LEAD facilitation will be delivered via videoconference on a
graded schedule over 18 months. Care teams will deliver DOCC to 25 children who meet the clinical cutoff
(75th percentile) on the Pediatric Symptom Checklist-17 Externalizing scale and their caregivers. We will collect
practice/provider measures from 175 practice staff (0, 6, 12, 18, 24 months) and 600 caregivers (i.e., 0, 3, 6,
12 months) to support all analyses. Collection of generalizable data to routine pediatric practice will yield new
knowledge about the impact, mediators, and moderators of CCM implementation. In one of the first large-scale
pediatric trials of a service system intervention to address these aims and respond to RFA-MH-18-701 and the
NIMH’s Strategic Plan (4.2), this trial will advance the implementation science knowledge needed to refine
promising strategies for accelerating the delivery and scale-up of DOCC in a pediatric medical home."
10760243,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The blood-retina barrier (BRB) protects the retina by limiting extravasation of solutes and immune cells and by
providing active transport mechanisms for required nutrients and hormones. BRB dysfunction is implicated in
retinal diseases including diabetic retinopathy, choroidal neovascularization, retinal occlusive diseases, uveitis,
macular telangiectasia, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, and Coat’s disease.
Although the key role of canonical Norrin and WNT7A/B signaling in inducing and maintaining blood-CNS
barriers has been identified, highly potent and therapeutically amenable agonists of these pathways that could
promote or restore BRB function are lacking. Signal initiation by Norrin requires the receptor Frizzled4 (FZD4)
and two co-receptors, low-density-lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) and tetraspanin-12 (TSPAN12).
Here, we use an entirely novel agonist to activate canonical (i.e., beta-catenin-dependent) signaling in
endothelial cells. The agonist is a human antibody modality that functionally mimics Norrin and WNT7A/B. The
mechanism of action and its efficacy in distinct types of BRB defects are not known. We will conduct cell-based
experiments to test the hypothesis that the agonist activates signaling by inducing complex formation of
receptor and co-receptor molecules. To understand which types of BRB defects can be restored by the
agonist, we will use multiple mouse models with BRB defects that have distinct characteristics. We will
determine the efficacy in restoring the BRB in each model, perform transcriptomic experiments and immuno-
histochemical analyses to identify mechanism of BRB restoration, and quantify vascular density. BRB defects,
e.g., in macular edema, are treated with anti-VEGF or anti-inflammatory drugs. However, anti-VEGF therapies
are not effective in all patients, and other patients may develop resistance. The novel agonist used here has an
entirely different pharmacodynamic profile compared to anti-VEGF and anti-inflammatory drugs. Therefore, it is
important to evaluate this drug candidate for its therapeutic potential."
10760245,"Kaposiform lymphangiomatosis (KLA) is a devastating congenital lymphatic anomaly with a 51% survival at
5 years, and 34% overall. KLA patients suffer from pleural and cardiac effusions and coagulopathy leading to
the high morbidity and mortality. The histopathology of KLA features lesions containing clusters of spindle-
shaped endothelial cells accompanying malformed lymphatic vessels typically in the lungs, spleen, abdomen,
and/or liver. The role, origin and function of these characteristic spindled endothelial cells is unclear. Definitive
diagnosis of KLA is often delayed due to the complex symptoms and the risks of biopsy due to the
coagulopathy. As part of a clinical trial using sirolimus (rapamycin; mTOR inhibitor) we were the first to identify
a blood biomarker for KLA, angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2), that may provide important insights into the underlying
disease mechanisms. ANG-2, which can act as a pro-angiogenic factor, was highly elevated in KLA patients
and decreased with sirolimus treatment suggesting that dysregulation of ANG-2 in KLA is dependent on
mTOR signaling. Additional possible insights into pathogenesis of KLA have come from the identification of a
somatic mutation NRAS Q61R in lesion tissue from patients. Q61R is an NRAS activating mutation in >20%
of melanomas and other cancers; however, its role in human endothelial cells and vascular malformations is
unclear. Our preliminary studies with human endothelial cells suggest that NRAS Q61R is upstream of ANG-
2 and induces the spindled endothelial cell morphology in KLA lesions. Proposed studies will identify the
processes and pathways involved in this regulation and help move the understanding of KLA pathogenesis
forward. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that NRAS Q61R mediates the pathogenesis
of KLA by increasing MAPK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, inducing spindled endothelial cells,
upregulating ANG-2 expression, and so driving abnormal lymphangiogenesis. We have developed
unique in vitro and in vivo models to test this hypothesis and preliminary data from our laboratory strongly
supports this proposed mechanism and demonstrates the feasibility of our approach. These studies will
address a critical knowledge gap in KLA. We will test new therapeutic targets since the current treatment,
sirolimus, at best only induces a partial clinical response. Our long-term goals are to elucidate the cellular and
molecular pathogenesis of KLA and identify new therapeutic targets. We are uniquely positioned having the
expertise and experimental models in hand."
10760323,"Degeneration or breakdown of the myelin sheath that wraps and insulates axons of the central nervous system,
as well as peripheral nerves, is a factor in a large array of neurological disorders. These include multiple
sclerosis, stroke, age-related neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, and in non-neurodegenerative age-
related cognitive impairment. To date, myelin breakdown has been assessed indirectly with neurophysiological
assays of conduction, post-mortem myelin staining, or in-vivo diffusion MRI. In the normal aging rhesus monkey,
post-mortem electron microscopy (EM) has confirmed myelin breakdown at the ultrastructural level; however,
EM studies cannot be scaled up to evaluate the entire 100-cc monkey brain or the larger human brain. Myelin
stains suffer from various technical and practical limitations that impede quantification. Other methods, like label-
free spectral confocal reflectance imaging (SCoRe), and coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS), are
promising, but like EM, are expensive, slow and difficult to apply to large brain sections. While SCoRe and CARS
microscopy work in reflectance, opening the possibility of in-vivo imaging through a cranial window in the small-
animal brain, a complementary method is needed that is validated, quantitative and high-resolution, to survey
the status of myelin in whole-brain sections of monkey or human brain. Here we propose to optimize and
validate quantitative birefringence microscopy (qBRM) for high-resolution imaging of normal and
abnormal myelin. The qBRM image provides, for every pixel, two quantitative measures: a) the relative phase
retardance, which is linearly proportional to the density of the birefringent medium and the organization of its
anisotropy; and b) the local orientation of the optic axis of the myelin, which corresponds to the direction of the
structural anisotropy. Archived brain tissues from two rhesus monkey models of myelin damage are available for
this project at the Boston University Medical Campus (BUMC). In Aim 1 we will automate the function of our
birefringence microscope with computer-controlled, motorized polarizer components and stage-positioning, to
facilitate fast, automated image acquisition (montaging) of large tissue sections (up to 40x40 mm). We will also
employ massively-parallel computing resources at BU to rapidly render the multi-megapixel quantitative images.
In Aim 2 we will validate our qBRM image measures by comparing them, in the same sections, with myelin
identified by myelin stains, such as FluoroMyelin Red, and with label-free spectral confocal reflectance (SCoRe)
microscopy. In Aim 3, We will demonstrate the untility of qBRM for quantifying myelin by imaging tissue sections
from three monkey models of myelin pathology: a) behaviorally characterized young and old monkeys with
cognitive assessment; b) behaviorally characterized old monkeys with impaired hand movement produced by
motor-cortex injury and treated with mesenchymal stem-cell derived extracellular vesicles (EVs); c) behaviorally
characterized old monkeys with demonstrated cognitive impairments treated with EVs. Together this will
establish the validity and utility of qBRM for assessing myelin in the central nervous system in health and disease."
10761792,"Abstract
Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CME) is one of the most important opportunistic infections affecting people
with HIV/AIDS. The importance of this disease is due not only to its high incidence and mortality in this and
other patient populations but also to the fact that symptoms of CME are a common sentinel event leading to
the diagnosis of HIV/AIDS. Thus, many patients must first survive CME before they can benefit from the
advances in HIV therapy. Unfortunately, the outcomes for CME therapy are far from acceptable, particularly in
resource-limited regions with high burdens of disease. Consequently, effective and widely available therapies
for CME are an unmet clinical need of global importance. Cryptococcus spp. are basidiomycetous yeasts
whose primary niche is the external environment. As such, only strains and species of Cryptococcus that can
transition to, and replicate within, the human host are able to cause disease. Our central premise is that an
understanding of the biological mechanisms required for Cryptococcus to survive in human beings could
provide new targets for therapy in the same way as studying tumor biology informs the design of new anti-
cancer drugs. An important environmental distinction between the human host and the natural niche of
Cryptococcus is the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2). We hypothesized that adaptation to host levels of
CO2 may represent a critical step in Cryptococcus pathogenesis. To specifically test this hypothesis, we
compared the growth of C. neoformans var. grubii strains under conditions that varied only in the concentration
of CO2. Consistent with our hypothesis, the growth rate was reduced at concentrations of CO2 experienced in
the host. Next, we tested the CO2 tolerance of a set of environmental strains with known virulence properties
in a mouse model; strains with reduced growth in the presence of host concentrations of CO2 were avirulent
while those with growth rates that matched clinical isolates from human patients were virulent. We, therefore,
have discovered that CO2 tolerance is a previously unrecognized host environment-associated
virulence attribute of C. neoformans. Accordingly, the goal of this proposal is to identify the genetic,
transcriptional, and regulatory responses that allow specific strains of C. neoformans to respond to host
concentrations of CO2 and, thereby, cause CME. To accomplish these goals, we propose the following
specific aims: Aim 1. Characterize the virulence, transcriptional, and genomic distinctions between CO2-
tolerant and -non-tolerant C. neoformans strains; Aim 2. Identify genes required for CO2 tolerance through
targeted and large-scale genetic screening; and Aim 3. Determine the molecular mechanisms of genes
required for C. neoformans CO2 response. Successful execution of these aims will not only further our
understanding C. neoformans pathogenesis and host survival but also identify new molecular targets for future
exploration as drug targets."
10930103,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia with 1 in 85 adults affected worldwide. The lack of
disease-modifying therapies or mechanistic biomarkers to reliably monitor treatment are key unmet needs.
Current standard of care (SoC), i.e., acetylcholinesterase or NMDA receptor blockade, provides limited
symptom-relief. Current evidence indicates that an inter-related, mechanistic triad is formed in AD by oxidative
stress (OxS), mitochondrial (mt) dysfunction and inflammation. This pathological trio occurs early and is
fundamental to AD. OxS primarily arises from unproductive mt-respiration and promotes mt-dysfunction.
Oxidized guanine (8-oxo-dG) is the most prominent oxidative and mutagenic DNA lesion, particularly in mtDNA.
Excessive amounts signify insufficient repair. Improving mt-function by enhancing mtDNA repair will modify AD
progression. Repair of 8-oxo-dG is an indispensable, mitochondrial quality control mechanism that largely occurs
by base excision repair. Accumulation of 8-oxo-dG leads to double-stranded breaks which cause mtDNA
deletions and fragmentation and culminates in loss of bioenergetic capacity and cell viability, a prominent AD
pathological feature. Fragmented mtDNA is expulsed to stimulate multiple proinflammatory pathways. Although
there are mt-approaches with potential for AD treatment, there are presently no therapies that target base
excision repair of oxidative damage. Luciole Pharmaceuticals’ approach is to improve DNA repair using small
molecules to enhance the catalytic activity of the DNA glycosylase, OGG1. In the first step of base excision
repair, OGG1 excises 8-oxo-dG while recruiting other pathway enzymes to complete repair in the nucleus and
mitochondria. Increasing OGG1 activity will result in the efficient removal of 8-oxo-dG to prevent strand breaks.
Ultimately, energetics and inflammation will improve to preserve neuronal function and slow AD progression.
Recent publications using either physio- or pharmacological approaches in AD murine models support our
hypothesis. Building on our previous success in discovering novel OGG1 activators (OAAs), we will develop
“first-in-class” orally available, small molecule OAAs that are differentiated from AD SoC drugs to modify AD and
advance patient quality of life in a multi-billion-dollar market. In this Phase I SBIR project, we plan to progress
OAA chemistry and in vitro screening assays to improve OAA potency and in vivo efficacy. If successful, our
Phase II project will include; 1) advancing a lead to candidate selection, 2) testing optimized compounds for
mtDNA expulsion in challenged human-derived iPSCs and murine AD models, 3) early safety assessment and
4) generating a novel mutant mouse model for testing the candidate compound."
10765634,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 In the U.S., trauma is the leading cause of death for those 1-45 years old and hemorrhage remains the largest
contributing factor to preventable death. Providers must rapidly identify those suffering from hemorrhage to
optimize outcome, but internal bleeding remains difficult to diagnose even for experienced clinicians. Little is
known on presentation about those suffering from occult hemorrhage and providers must quickly make treatment
decisions in these time-pressured, time-sensitive clinical scenarios. This proposal seeks to develop through
artificial intelligence, a type of advanced machine learning, prediction algorithms that could be deployed
at the bedside of patients to assist clinicians with more timely recognition of hemorrhage. By doing so,
we hypothesize that this approach (integrating diverse data sources that have not previously been combined to
one another) could identify patterns in our patients that far surpass current capabilities to quickly detect and act
on the critical components contributing to outcome. The ability to rapidly pinpoint these patterns and display
them to the bedside clinician could allow more timely intervention and precise therapeutic approaches for
hemorrhage control.
 Beyond the challenges in rapidly identifying bleeding, current treatment of hemorrhage is rudimentary with
a standard resuscitation approach for all patients. This reflects attempts to optimize outcome based upon the
average treatment effect, rather than being adaptable for unique patient phenotypes. Hemorrhage is believed to
initiate a complex chain of events involving crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems that
are hypothesized to play a key role in outcome. Trauma has a known time zero of onset, making it an ideal model
to study the immediate pathophysiologic changes associated with hemorrhage. This complex, individual patient
biology is believed to explain why those suffering similar injury have differing outcomes. However, to date, these
individual characteristics are poorly understood and not factored into initial treatment approaches. Through this
proposal, I also seek to define novel digital biomarkers representing patient phenotypes that require
precision resuscitation approaches to maximize outcome. Fundamental to reducing hemorrhagic deaths is
the need to elucidate a deeper understanding of these mechanistic models of patient states. Strategies that help
to identify novel patient phenotypes that could benefit from more tailored treatment pathways may provide
important advances in decreasing preventable death.
 The net result of this proposal will be a deeper insight into the mechanistic models contributing to
evolving patient states following hemorrhage, and identify the key phenotypes or digital biomarkers
associated with mortality, complications, and occult hemorrhage. Finding solutions to advance our
resuscitation approaches following hemorrhage has potential to decrease complications, save lives, and reduce
health care costs."
10765635,"Title: Chemical synthesis and non-chromatographic purification of long RNA oligonucleotides containing
naturally occurring modifications.
ABSTRACT:
 Solid phase synthesis of RNA is an important genomic tool, which offers precise control over the
oligonucleotide sequence and offers an opportunity for site-specific incorporation of RNA modifications,
fluorescent labels and biochemical tags. Discoveries of the twenty-first century created a strong need for a robust
synthesis of RNA strands, that are 100-200 nucleotides (-nt) in length. A major limitation of otherwise highly
optimized process is purification, which is notoriously difficult, labor intensive and requires expensive HPLC
instrumentation. As the result, solid phase synthesis of long oligonucleotides containing RNA modifications is
rarely attempted. This technology-development proposal aims to address this limitation by developing a non-
chromatographic RNA purification method which will be 10-times faster and 2-orders of magnitude cheaper and
will allow isolation of strands that are 100-200-nt long in good yield and 98% purity.
 The proposed purification strategy is based on bio-orthogonal inverse electron demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA)
chemistry between trans-cyclooctene (TCO) and tetrazine (Tz) that allows to selectively tag and purify
structurally complex and increasing long RNA strands from the failure strands that accrue during solid phase
synthesis. TCO and Tz are highly selective for each other and have minimal cross-reactivity with other functional
groups found in RNA. The bio-orthogonal click chemistry is highly efficient, even at very low concentrations of
TCO and Tz. During preliminary studies we have shown that our strategy allows efficient synthesis and
purification of 76-nt long tRNA and 101-nt long sgRNA with yields that were 10-times higher than conventional
purification methods.
 During the proposed research program, we aim to improve a number of important elements of our design to
bring the overall process to under 7 hrs, further improve the overall yield and purity of the isolated RNA. In Aim
1, we propose to expedite the process by developing a new photolabile linker that will allow fast photocleavage
using visible light. To improve purity and yield of isolated RNA, we propose to optimize the solid phase synthesis
procedure to ensure that all failure sequences are fully capped during each synthetic cycle. The optimized
process will be applied to increasingly longer RNA strands, from 76-nt tRNA to 188-nt long U2 snRNA. In Aim 2,
we plan to illustrate the power of our technology by synthesizing a 144-nt long artificial mRNA, containing m1A
and m6A modifications near the start codon. This will be the longest reported oligonucleotide containing RNA
modifications. The artificial mRNA will be utilized to investigate the impact of RNA modifications on the rate of in
vitro translation. We plan to work with NHGRI technology development team to make the proposed technology
widely available to researchers."
10765707,"Project Summary/Abstract
Persons with HIV (PWH) in the western world have a life expectancy near that of the general population, yet
they remain at a significantly elevated risk of developing cognitive impairments. Such impairments are the most
common neurological complication of HIV disease, and research targeting these comorbidities is one of four
overarching priorities identified by the Office of AIDS Research (NOT-OD-20-018). Recent human neuroimaging
studies have broadly shown that the milder impairments more frequently observed in virally-suppressed PWH
arise from multiple cortical circuits, which is a major paradigm shift from the putative subcortical origins of the
severe cognitive impairments observed earlier in the epidemic. However, despite this progress, we still have a
limited understanding of the molecular precursors and pathways that lead to dysfunction in these cortical circuits,
and virtually no viable therapeutic options, with only limited potential avenues (e.g., cannabis) on the horizon.
This proposal responds to RFA-DA-22-012, which calls for applications that “define HIV-associated persistent
inflammation and its causal link to HIV-related comorbidities such as … neurological disorders,” “explore the
interaction between HIV immune activation and cannabinoid use as it pertains to neurological disorders,” and
“characterize and validate the potential anti-inflammatory, immune stabilizing (beneficial) properties of canna-
binoids in chronic HIV infection.” The proposed project responds to this call with an innovative, large-scale,
dynamic neuroimaging and molecular markers study that leverages multiple recent discoveries to identify the
impact of cannabis use on the mechanisms and pathways underlying HIV-related persistent inflammation and
decline in cognitive and brain function in virally-suppressed PWH. Each of our aims builds on a major discovery
in 2021. Specifically, Aim 1 examines whether cannabis use modulates the superoxide-sensitive mitochondrial
redox environment and neuroinflammation in PWH, which follows on the heels of our finding that mitochondrial
function differentially modulates superoxide in PWH compared to controls, and that the latter predicts neuro-
inflammation and cognitive function. Aim 2 identifies whether attention- and motor-related neural oscillations
are directly modulated by the same superoxide-sensitive pathway in PWH, which builds on our major discovery
featured in PNAS that the superoxide-sensitive mitochondrial redox environment predicts cognitive performance
and the underlying neural oscillations in controls. Finally, Aim 3 builds on our recent breakthrough that cannabis
suppresses the pathological spontaneous cortical activity that is observed in PWH, and further accentuated in
cognitively impaired PWH, by examining whether these cannabis-induced alterations are mediated by the
superoxide-sensitive mitochondrial redox environment. These recent, major scientific advances provide an ideal
foundation to directly address the key objectives of this RFA through an innovative project that utilizes state-of-
the-art neuroimaging and systems biology methods, and builds on an established model of neuroinflammation
in PWH that has been linked to cognitive and neural function in healthy adults and cognitive decline in PWH."

The mitochondrial Ca2+ transport system includes three members in the mitochondrial inner membrane:
the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, and the H+/Ca2+ exchanger. These Ca2+
transport proteins work together to regulate mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis, oxidative phosphorylation,
cell-death pathways, and cytoplasmic Ca2+ signaling. Abnormal mitochondrial Ca2+ transport can induce
severe pathological conditions, such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, neurodegenerative disease, heart
failure, and cancer metastasis. The goal of this project is to close critical knowledge gaps about the
molecular mechanisms of these proteins. The mitochondrial calcium uniporter is a multi-subunit Ca2+
channel that conducts cytoplasmic Ca2+ into the mitochondrial matrix. Here, we will employ combined
biochemical, biophysical, electrophysiological, and structural-biology methods to (1) establish the
mechanisms by which a poorly-studied, neuron-specific MICU3 subunit potentiates the uniporter, (2)
identify the functional roles of the MCUR1 subunit in the uniporter complex and characterize its
molecular properties, and (3) determine how small-molecule compounds inhibit or activate the uniporter
to unveil novel pharmacological mechanisms to manipulate uniporter activities. Mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+
and H+/Ca2+ exchange, mediated by NCLX and Letm1, respectively, export matrix Ca2+ back to the
cytoplasm. The molecular basis of NCLX/Letm1 ion transport and regulation remains mostly unknown
to date. We have now established liposome reconstitution and electrical-recording tools to subject these
proteins to detailed functional scrutiny. Our aims include (1) establishing Michaelis-Menten kinetics of
NCLX in a sided system, (2) investigating how NCLX can be pharmacologically inhibited and regulated
by oxidation of conserved cysteines, and (3) testing an innovative hypothesis that Letm1 catalyzes
H+/Ca2+ exchange using a similar antiport mechanism as CLC H+/Cl- exchangers. Completing this
research will fundamentally improve our knowledge about the mechanisms governing substrate
transport, regulation, and pharmacological modulation of the mitochondrial Ca2+ transport process.
These efforts can provide mechanistic information guiding future endeavors to design new therapeutic
strategies to treat diseases related to abnormal mitochondrial Ca2+ transport and homeostasis."

Black/African-American communities, and diverse cohort of research mentors, the TBS Program will prioritize
the selection and training of predoctoral trainees belonging to URM groups (women, racial/ethnic minorities,
individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, and individuals with disabilities). In doing so, the program will
intentionally promote workforce diversity to achieve health equity. The TBS Program will be co-directed by
three, highly-regarded translational researchers with leadership roles in clinical and translational research
education at VCU and housed within the Wright Regional Center for Clinical and Translational Science to
provide trainees with a breadth of training and career development opportunities as well as exposure to a
transdisciplinary, collaborative, and translational research environment. A cadre of mentors comprised of select
faculty from 15 different departments at VCU whose research addresses all stages of the translational
spectrum as well as Translational/Community advisers will create a fertile training environment that
encourages the development of researchers who are confident working with a variety of collaborators. During
the funding period, two highly-qualified trainees will be appointed to the TBS Program annually (total of 10
trainees over the 5-year funding period). In summary, the TBS Program will provide a comprehensive
educational experience that prepares a diverse group of trainees for successful, independent research careers
in the broad area of translational science as well as equips them with the skills to work across disciplines and
with stakeholders to design, disseminate, and implement their research."

The Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) is an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center dedicated to cancer
research, education, and patient care for the citizens of Minnesota. Since the time of the first award in 1997,
there has been growth of the membership and research base. In our original application, there were 89
members; this has increased to 245 members from 49 departments and 11 colleges and schools of the
University of Minnesota. Since our last renewal, there has been growth in cancer-related direct funding from
$71.8M to $88.1M, a 23% increase.
The MCC is organized into 6 Programs that focus on specific scientific themes: Screening, Prevention, Etiology
and Cancer Survivorship; Carcinogenesis and Chemoprevention; Genetic Mechanisms; Cell Mechanisms;
Immunology; and Transplant and Cellular Therapy. These programs are supported by 10 Shared Resources.
The past funding period has seen increased emphasis on developing our translational pipeline. The resources
available to members for effective translation have been reorganized under the leadership of a single
Associate Director (AD) with oversight of both the fiscal resources and “idea generating” Translational Working
Groups. Close collaboration between the AD for Translational Research and our AD for Clinical Research has
led to the emergence of multiple new interventional trials from the science of MCC.
MCC is a successful matrix organization in a large public research university that engages its faculty to focus
on the problem of cancer. As such, MCC has engaged the community within our entire catchment area,
established a longitudinal training pathway for learners, and is developing a plan for enhancing diversity within
our workforce and patient population. Our current period of support has been characterized by growth in NCI-
funded research; stability in our leadership; enhanced engagement of our community; and creation of several
new cancer-focused initiatives including a statewide cancer clinical trials network, a global cancer prevention
institute, and a developmental therapeutics initiative.
Together, these activities fulfill our aims to 1) conduct high-impact population, basic, translational, and clinical
research focused on eliminating the burden of cancer, especially in underrepresented populations; 2) provide
the administrative and research structure at the University of Minnesota to engage our partners in the conduct
of cancer research; 3) build multi- and transdisciplinary teams to address complex cancer problems; 4)
educate the next generation of cancer researchers with special emphasis on enhancing diversity within the
workforce; and 5) engage local, state, national, and international partners in helping MCC solve the problem of
cancer."

10768584,"Summary
Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects an estimated 71 million people worldwide. Chronic HCV
infection frequently leads to liver cirrhosis and predisposes infected individuals to liver cancer.
Approximately, 400,000 die from HCV-related complications a year. While a cure for HCV has recently
been developed, access to and affordability of this treatment is limited. Furthermore, less than 20% of
chronically infected individuals are aware of their diagnosis. Therefore, to eliminate HCV, a vaccine is
still urgently needed. Because of the genetic variability of the HCV, to date HCV vaccines that have been
tested clinically have not been successful at preventing chronic infection. This study takes advantage of
recent structural data of HCV antigen complexes, computational methods to optimize antigen structure
presentation, multivalent presentation of those antigens on self-assembling nanoparticles, and preclinical
testing in a nonhuman primate model that has demonstrated strong predictive value of human antibody
responses. Core C: NHP, based at the Southwest National Primate Research Center, will evaluate the
immunogenicity of rationally designed HCV vaccine antigens and nanoparticles using a non-human
primate (NHP) model, rhesus macaques, and collect blood and tissue samples to enable in-depth
analysis of the immune responses elicited by the vaccine antigens in this P01 research program."
10768587,"Project Summary
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects 1-2% of the world population and poses a significant threat to public health.
Recent studies have identified a panel of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) and their genetic preferences.
The crystal structures of various HCV E2 constructs in complex with bnAbs and non-nAbs provide a structural
basis for rational vaccine design. In Project 2 of this P01 proposal, we will combine structural optimization of
HCV antigens, nanoparticle engineering, in vivo assessment, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of B-cell
repertoires to assist in rational design of HCV vaccines that can elicit a bnAb response. The Specific Aims in
this project are: (1) To develop vaccine antigens to target multidonor class antibody responses. The
major virus neutralizing site, the E2 neutralizing face (E2 NF), is a well-known multidonor class antibody target
on HCV. E2 NF is conformationally flexible and is surrounded and protected by immunodominant variable
loops and N-glycans. The antigenic surface at and around E2 NF will be optimized by computational modeling
and mutagenesis scanning to “lock” E2 NF into desired neutralizing conformations. A rigid E2 NF, together with
modifications to improve protein folding and to minimize the decoy effect of immunodominant epitopes, should
improve the immunogenicity of vaccine antigens and as a result elicit multidonor class bnAbs to the conserved
neutralizing epitopes. (2) To develop E1E2-based vaccine antigens. In addition to E2 NF, the native E1E2
complex also present other conserved bnAb epitopes. We will apply scanning mutagenesis to the interface of
E1 and E2 ectodomains and design novel E1 and E2 fusion constructs to improve the stability and production
of the soluble E1E2 complex for the elicitation of bnAbs targeting the quaternary structure of the complex. (3)
To develop self-assembling antigen-presenting nanoparticle vaccines. The engineered E2 and E1E2
complex will be fused with the scaffold proteins of different nanoparticle platforms to identify a platform optimal
for the multimeric display of HCV antigens to the immune system. Based on our preliminary data, this strategy
will greatly improve the immunogenicity of vaccine antigens and elicit a rapid and potent nAb response. (4) To
evaluate immunogenicity and antibody responses of vaccine candidates in the mouse and non-human
primate (NHP) rhesus macaque models. The engineered E2, E1E2 antigens and nanoparticles will first be
studied in mice to confirm their immunogenicity in vivo and their ability to elicit antibodies that can bind and
neutralize HCV. The antigens and nanoparticles with the best properties in vitro and in mice will be studied
further using the NHP model. We have recently shown that rhesus macaques react to E1E2 immunization in a
manner highly reminiscent to that used by humans and develop bnAbs against E2 NF with genetic similarity to
human bnAbs. Here, we will immunize NHPs, identify bnAbs, and perform repertoire NGS to evaluate selected
antigen designs. The outcome of Project 2 would be a set of well-characterized HCV vaccine candidates."
10768663,"Leukemia Program
Project Summary / Abstract
The mission of the Leukemia Program is to improve patient outcomes through innovative translational research
on acute and chronic leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and antecedent
premalignant states. Our longstanding objectives are to (a) discover cell-intrinsic and microenvironmental
drivers of these conditions, and (b) translate laboratory discoveries into investigator-initiated early-phase
clinical trials. To develop novel therapeutics, Program members leverage effective and fruitful collaborations
between leukemia biologists, chemists, immunologists, and clinicians. These interactions depend critically on
the Cancer Center’s collaborative infrastructure, shared resources, outstanding systems for clinical trial review
and conduct, and the deep culture of bench-to-bedside investigation across the consortium. Community
outreach and training in cancer research are deeply embedded in the Program’s laboratory, translational, and
clinical efforts.
The Program’s 89 members (69 primary and 20 secondary) represent six DF/HCC institutions and 10
academic departments. In 2019, peer-reviewed grant funding attributed to the Program was $8.9 million in
direct costs from the NCI and $8.3 million from other sponsors. During the current funding period, primary
Program members published 1,129 cancer-relevant papers. Of these, 27% were inter-institutional, 26% were
intra-programmatic, and 41% were inter-programmatic collaborations between two or more DF/HCC members.
For the next CCSG funding period, we propose the following two Specific Aims: 1) Identify novel mechanisms
that contribute to the pathogenesis of acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative
neoplasms and premalignant states, and 2) Advance therapeutics that target vulnerabilities in these diseases."
10768731,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The purpose of this K01 proposal is to provide Alina Schnake-Mahl, ScD MPH with the protected time and
resources to pursue the additional training needed to reach her long-term goal of an independent academic
career in health policy and social epidemiology, focused on generating evidence to inform law and policies that
reduce health inequities in infectious diseases. This proposal builds on Dr. Schnake-Mahl’s background as a
social epidemiologist with expertise in health policy. It also leverages her experience with applied health care
research and evaluation, and a cohesive mentorship team, to improve our understanding of the social
determinants of COVID-19 and influenza disparities. Over 878,000 people have been hospitalized for COVID-
19 over the last year, and between 140,000 to 710,000 people are hospitalized for flu annually. Studies have
found wide disparities in COVID-19 and influenza, but gaps remain with respect to the interactions between the
social determinants of these disparities. This project uses diverse and multi-disciplinary approaches to
examine the determinants of disparities and effects of policy exposures on disparities. The specific aims are to:
1) use multilevel analysis to describe the social determinants of racial and geographic disparities in influenza
and COVID-19 outcomes in US cities; 2) use non-experimental causal inference methods to estimate the effect
of PSL and rent control laws on rates and disparities of influenza and COVID-19 outcomes in US cities; 3) use
agent based modeling to understand mechanisms linking two key social determinants, occupational exposures
and housing overcrowding, and influenza disparities. The training goals are designed to expand skills and
knowledge through training in infectious disease epidemiology, casual inference methods for policy analysis,
and systems approaches including agent-based modeling. Training in this set of complementary approaches
will position the candidate to pursue innovative research in the area of infectious disease disparities as part of
a future R01. The proposed work has substantial potential to make a significant public health impact as these
aims will advance our understanding of the social determinants of COVID-19 and influenza disparities and
provide a strong evidence-base for policies and interventions that may address these inequities and reduce the
overall burden of COVID-19 and influenza. Furthermore, this K01 develops specific topic area (infectious
disease) and methods (advanced causal inference for policy analysis and systems dynamics) expertise whose
extension to other infectious disease indicates applicability beyond the scope of this proposal. The proposed
work is feasible and realistic within the award period and will allow Dr. Schnake-Mahl to continue to build
research skills, extend professional networks, generate numerous publications, and compete for other NIH
funding. In summary, this K01 award will support and stimulate the career development activities of Dr.
Schnake Mahl and allow her to successfully move into the next phase of her career as an independent
investigator."
10804677,"Project Summary:
Ventricular tachyarrhythmias are responsible for 300,000 sudden cardiac deaths a year in the US. The
mechanisms underlying these arrhythmias in the majority of cases are ventricular tachycardia (VT) and/or
ventricular fibrillation (VF). The ever-increasing prevalence of obesity also poses a significant burden on
the health care system with increased morbidity and mortality. Importantly, obesity has been associated
with cardiac arrhythmias with increased risk of sudden cardiac death linked to increased adiposity.
However, the mechanisms by which obesity could result in ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) remain
incompletely understood. In this proposal, I plan to use a multimodal and multiscale approach to
characterize VT/VF in donor human hearts associated with sustained obesity. In the mentored phase of
this project, I will use donor hearts to investigate the role of epicardial adiposity in promoting VT/VF via
paracrine signaling, while also getting specialized training in bioinformatics and adipocyte biology. In the
independent phase of this project, I will use donor hearts to investigate the role of epicardial adiposity in
generating arrhythmogenic triggers. The experiments outlined below will advance our understanding of
VT/VF mechanisms and also serve as proof-of-concept for future experiments designed to develop new
markers to predict and treat VT/VF vulnerability in a clinical setting."
10768463,"The University of Washington has a long and robust tradition of training residents in the neurosciences for
careers as physician-scientists in academic medicine. This renewal proposal will combine the efforts of the
Departments of Neurological Surgery and Neurology to provide longitudinal interdisciplinary neuroscience
instruction, mentorship and support for residents engaging in dedicated research. The ultimate goal of the
project is fourfold: 1) Provide longitudinal interdisciplinary instruction on neuroscience research; 2) supervise
and mentor residents during dedicated 6-12 month research increments (extendable to up to 18 months); 3)
Prepare neurosurgery and neurology residents for careers as academic faculty physician-scientists with
independent research funding; and 4) Endeavor to recruit and retain diverse faculty and residents. Candidates
will pursue research with experienced faculty mentors in one (or more) of three research cores: Acute Neural
Injury/Neuroengineering, Neuro-Oncology, and Neurogenetics/Neurodegenerative Disease. Residents will
receive sustained scientific mentorship, formal instruction and career guidance throughout residency, including
specific instruction on the responsible conduct of research, rigor, integrity and ethics. Participants will develop
their own research hypotheses and experimental design, engage in high-quality, collaborative research both
during and beyond their dedicated research increments, and prepare an application for a mentored K-award or
similar independent funding in preparation for the transition to junior investigator. The leadership, resources,
environment and residents from both departments, when combined with the broader university-wide research
infrastructure, ensures that participants will be well-prepared to become leaders in collaborative research as
the next generation of neurosurgery and neurology physician-scientists."
10769194,"Summary
Epilepsy affects over 70 million people globally and more than 3.6 million Americans, 1/3 of who are not
controlled by medication. While new technologies like laser ablation, implantable devices, high bandwidth
intracranial EEG (iEEG), and multimodal imaging have improved therapies, meaningful data sharing is lacking
which limits clinical progress and translational research. There is a tremendous need to aggregate, share and
collaborate on increasingly large and complex multimodal data from patients with medication-resistant epilepsy
to advance these efforts, but a lack of novel mechanisms to share and explore these data in a meaningful way.
Our central hypothesis is that a scalable, self-sustaining Epilepsy Data Ecosystem (EDE), which integrates
multi-modal datasets and is responsive to the changing needs of the epilepsy community, will dramatically
accelerate translational research and impact clinical care. The EDE will also accelerate the fields of Machine
Learning, Neuroscience and Computer Science, communities that depend upon large, multimodal data from
these patients for their research. Over the past 14 years our group has focused on building tools and community
to accelerate translational epilepsy and neuroscience research through two major efforts: (1) through our open-
source platform iEEG.org, for sharing data and computational tools in epilepsy. Seeded by a grant from NINDS
from 2009-2013 and supported by a group of over 200 scientists focused on Engineering and Epilepsy Research
(the ICTALS group), the platform now has almost 6,000 users and is self-sustaining, paid for by groups who use
it for their research needs. It shares over 1,000 published data sets free of charge, and it has generated scores of
publications. Advances to care, data standards and platform technologies as well as the significant increase in
data volume require that iEEG.org be updated. (2) Led by Dr. Joost Wagenaar, The Pennsieve Platform was
independently developed over the last 7 years as an open-source, cloud-based data management and sharing
platform for large volume, multi-modal data in the Neurosciences, with a focus on standards, scalability, and
sustainability. It is currently used as the data core for several NIH programs (e.g. SPARC and REJOIN) and is
ideally suited to replace iEEG.org as the next generation repository for multimodal data in Epilepsy research.
Our goals for this proposal are: (1) To migrate all data, tools, and users from iEEG.org to Pennsieve, to ensure
continued impact of iEEG.org public datasets by updating the data to adhere to current standards, (2) To tailor
Pennsieve to the Epilepsy Community's needs, to develop seamless mechanisms for submitting, finding,
sharing, accessing, and publishing high impact Epilepsy Datasets in line with all FAIR requirements and
standards in the age of big integrated data, (3) To build community and prospective data contributions to the
EDE through educational workshops, seminars and web content, and (4) to leverage Pennsieve's workflows and
existing model to ensure sustainability. This project leverages an established collaboration between
investigators across Medicine and Engineering at Penn, and the International Epilepsy Community."
10770997,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Neuroimmune signaling is strongly implicated in the development and progression of alcohol use
disorder (AUD). Innate immune molecules are upregulated in human postmortem brains from alcoholics and
are correlated with lifetime alcohol use. Human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) also link
immune/inflammatory genes to alcohol dependence. We hypothesize that alcohol consumption initiates a
positive feedback loop involving neuroimmune activation and proinflammatory responses that promote
excessive alcohol consumption. Neuroimmune signaling also regulates voluntary alcohol consumption in
rodent models and activation of specific pathways results in escalation of drinking. Our recent work shows that
immune signaling in glial cells have emerged as key regulators of alcohol drinking. Using single cell and spatial
transcriptome technologies, we are now able to precisely define the role of individual types of brain cells in the
context of excessive alcohol consumption. Our overarching hypothesis is phenotypic changes characteristic of
escalated alcohol consumption and preference are due, in part, to spatially distinct and cell-specific molecular
mechanisms that significantly reshape the neuroimmune transcriptome. Multi-omic genetic changes at the
cellular level from human and animal models will reveal new gene candidates and therapeutic targets."

extracurricular experiences are stellar, including substantial research experience and proven commitment to
service. We plan to appoint MSTP trainees to the T32 during their first two years in the program. We will also
appoint students returning to medical school after completing their PhD who do not hold F30 awards. Through
our UNC MSTP, students will be able to pursue their graduate training in 15 individual departments and 5
curricula representing the Schools of Medicine, Public Health, Pharmacy, and the College of Arts and Sciences.
Our leadership team includes Dr. Toni Darville and Dr. Mohanish Deshmukh, who serve as Co-Directors and
Alison Regan, who is the Assistant Director. Our program emphasizes strong education in clinical medicine that
is well integrated with superb research opportunities not only in biomedical sciences but also in other important
areas of public health. Throughout their training, we promote a framework that compels students to define clinical
implications of their research, and how research affects clinical care. Our program leverages resources from the
UNC Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA), the Biological and Biomedical Sciences Program (BBSP),
links students with physician scientist role models, and structurally integrates research and clinical work in the
thesis process, and in research-in-progress and clinical case conferences. During the PhD phase of training,
students are engaged in a longitudinal clinical clerkship to maintain clinical skills. Graduating PhD students
participate in the Extra Practice to Transition to Application Phase course to promote clinical confidence upon
returning to medical school. These mechanisms help ensure that our students learn essential skills including
conducting rigorous and reproducible research, oral presentation, and manuscript writing. Critical grant writing
skills are taught through a rigorous F30 bootcamp and mock review sessions. Additionally, we meet extensively
with each student throughout their training to ensure that they have a complete support system for research,
clinical, and career mentorship via peer colleagues and faculty. Finally, we expose them to leadership and
career development opportunities to prepare them for careers as Clinician Scientist leaders. Training outcomes
include receiving a high percentage of honors for clinical rotations, obtaining first author publications,
successfully competing for a variety of awards and independent funding (e.g., F30 awards from the NIH),
completing the dual degree program with the average time of 8.1 years, matching at outstanding academic

10769020,"Project Summary/Abstract
Academic enrichment opportunities supporting the development of critical biomedical research skills are not
widely available to college students from low-income and underrepresented minority (URM) backgrounds. This
is particularly problematic for infectious disease research since infectious diseases disproportionately impact
communities of color. In short, the current training system all but excludes the individuals who have the most
relevant lived experiences and are among the greatest stakeholders from key decision-making roles, which has
been shown to negatively affect public health. The lack of diversity at the highest levels has recently garnered
more attention—with many people pointing to a “leaky” pipeline for URM education and training. One key “leak”
that has received relatively little attention despite its enormous impact on URM student participation is the
transition from community colleges to four-year universities. With very few opportunities for specialized training
or research experience at community colleges, a vast majority of URM students at these institutions do not
pursue education beyond an associate’s degree. More than 40% of the total URM collegiate student population
is lost at this two- to four-year university transition. This partnership between investigators at Rice University and
Houston Community College (HCC) will begin “plugging” this leak by providing auxiliary professional, technical,
and experiential support for URM students enrolled at HCC—a Minority-Serving Institution that is also the fifth-
largest community college system in the United States. Importantly, this program will not only support URM
students through their transfer to a four-year university but also provide career-long mentorship to minimize drop-
out at higher levels of education and training. This program aims to Augment Community College Education,
Leverage Experiential Research, and Advance Training Equity (ACCELERATE) by recruiting, training, and
supporting diverse cohorts of biology and engineering students on the path to four-year universities, graduate
studies, and high-level job placement in the infectious disease workforce. Our program includes professional
development seminars; literature review training; a high-touch series of scaffolded laboratory modules for
technical skill-building; mentored summer research internships in labs at Rice University and the Texas Medical
Center (TMC); multi-tiered concurrent mentorship from the Program PIs, HCC faculty, TMC investigators, and
Rice postdocs and graduate students; and career development resources for HCC faculty who wish to become
research active. Through these initiatives, we will enhance students’ skills and knowledge, assist students in
building mentor and peer networks to build resilience and foster a sense of belonging, equip students with the
professional savvy necessary to pursue a career in biomedical research, support students’ applications to
transfer to four-year universities, and train faculty on how to better support URM students and scientists with the
ultimate goal of diversifying the infectious disease workforce."
10769058,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The fields of emergency medicine and hospital medicine deliver rapid diagnosis, treatment, and transitional
care for the most common acute heart, lung, and blood disorders in the hospital setting. Despite being the
foundation of hospital-based care, these fields are underrepresented in scientific career development efforts.
These are complex conditions with systemic challenges requiring interdisciplinary approaches to engage
patients and health system stakeholders, develop new knowledge, and translate this knowledge into practice.
Building on Vanderbilt’s strong infrastructure and track record of training research fellows, we propose the
Vanderbilt Interdisciplinary Hospital-based Systems of Care Research Training ProgrAm (VISTA). This
two-year training program will train three postdoctoral investigators per year, with a focus on patient-oriented
and health systems research for acute heart, lung, or blood disorders in the hospital setting. The program is
rooted in the model of learning health systems, which are designed to “generate and apply the best evidence
for the collaborative healthcare choices of each patient and provider, drive the process of discovery as a
natural outgrowth of patient care, and ensure innovation, quality, safety, and value in healthcare.”
We will provide junior investigators with role models and forums that demonstrate the intellectual productivity
and practical benefits of multidisciplinary research in advancing human health. We endorse a team-based
approach to filling knowledge gaps and translating discoveries into application. A robust and diverse pool of

10769092,"Project Summary. Research performed in Puerto Rico (PR) provides an opportunity to advance knowledge of
cancer risk, and cancer prevention and control among Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations in the United
States (US). Since 2019, the Cancer Prevention and Control (CAPAC) Research Training Program at the
Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences of the University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer
Center has sought to increase the pool of master’s degree graduates and other health professionals who
pursue a doctoral degree and/or a career in cancer prevention and control research with a focus on Hispanic
health and cancer health disparities. CAPAC increases trainees’ understanding of the spectrum of cancer
prevention and control research, strengthens their research skills and experience, as well as their cultural
awareness and sensitivity to disparities and Hispanic populations. We recruit participants from all racial/ethnic
groups and cultural backgrounds to participate in a 10- or 15-week hands-on research experience with a
Hispanic population and cultural environment during the summer. Trainees are selected based on their merit
(academic performance, letters of recommendation, and research interests) and are matched to a mentor
based on their research interest in basic, clinical/translational, and population-based research. Educational
activities include seminars and workshops to strengthen the trainee’s skills (i.e. successful interview
techniques, manuscript writing, and leadership) to increase their interest in pursuing a doctoral degree and/or
careers in cancer prevention and control research. Given its need, and building on the program’s success
(2019-2023), for this new cycle the CAPAC Research Training Program aims to: 1) Recruit 25 masters-level
and health professional students (and recent graduates from these programs) annually to participate in
mentored hands-on cancer prevention and control research experiences in PR, with a focus on Hispanic health
and cancer disparities; 2) Provide trainees with the skills to pursue a doctoral degree and/or a career in cancer
prevention and control research; and 3) Conduct process and outcome evaluation of short-, intermediate-, and
long-term goals. For this second cycle of the CAPAC program, we propose an annual increase from 20 to 25
trainees participating (n=125 total) and to integrate new topics and activities based on lessons learned in the
first cycle. These are intended to strengthen participants’ interactions with one another and their cultural
competency and sensitivity in clinical and research settings. In addition, among the 25 trainees, we will recruit
annually 1-2 former CAPAC alumni for a second-time experience as peer-to-peer mentors with new program
participants. Our outcomes of interest include (1) recruitment of trainees from underrepresented groups, (2)
trainee and mentor satisfaction with the program, (3) trainees who become co-authors in scientific
presentations and/or manuscripts, (4) trainees who present their research work in scientific meetings, and (5)
trainees who continue doctoral studies and/or careers in cancer prevention and control research."

Gene regulation is the foundation of nearly all aspects of biology and human disease. The Eukaryotic Gene
Regulation (EGR) Predoctoral Training Program will train a future generation of scientists in experimental,
molecular and computational sciences to understanding the mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation. EGR
connects and further develops trainees and faculty from five established graduate programs: Biochemistry,
Microbiology and Molecular Biology (BMMB), Chemistry (CHEM), Biology (BIOL), Molecular Cellular and
Integrative Biosciences (MCIBS), and Bioinformatics and Genomics (BGEN). The EGR training program
builds upon a successful 5-year period of prior support and is led by a close-knit group of 22 highly productive
faculty. We seek funding for 4 new trainees/yr, supported for two years each in the 2nd and 3rd years. A
generous institutional match will fund 1-2 additional trainees/yr, strengthening recruitment efforts to diversify
the trainee pool and allow for a strong cohort of 8-10 predoctoral students/yr. Students will be prepared for
laboratory training in gene regulation through a carefully crafted curriculum, including foundational courses in
molecular sciences and specialty courses in gene regulation, computation, statistics, and ethical and rigorous
research methods. Students will be trained by faculty and interact with peers using structural biology,
computation and genomics, molecular and cellular biology and biophysical techniques in their research,
preparing them to perform outstanding cross-disciplinary research. Activities include weekly meetings to build
presentation and data analysis skills, monthly trainee-run meetings, a yearly retreat, and cohort-strengthening
activities. Comprehensive and continuous RCR and rigor and reproducibility instruction are provided by the
faculty and are incorporated into activities throughout the training program. Exemplary institutional match
supports enhancements and innovations to the current EGR, including internship opportunities through an
industry-academic partnership and a new Alumni Mentor Program for career development. Trainee leadership
skills will be built through student-organized monthly meetings, and a new peer mentoring program, which we
predict will contribute to increased retention through improved trainee satisfaction and feeling of belonging.
An evidence-based assessment plan has been developed to track program effectiveness and guide future
improvements. Mentor training and close attention to student progress and tracking will improve the overall
experience for students and help recruit future cohorts. Trainees will obtain a thorough understanding of the
scientific process, learn to conduct research responsibly and rigorously, gain fluency in innovative research
methodologies, learn to utilize bioinformatics and statistical tools in advancing genome-wide experimental
approaches. The impact of EGR will extend well beyond those supported by this grant by allowing unfunded
students to participate in the training activities and by modeling best practices in training, RCR and rigor and
reproducibility instruction and preparing a diverse cohort for careers in the biomedical sciences."
10771136,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The majority of older adult patients who seek physical therapy have pain. Physical rehabilitation for many
painful orthopedic and neurologic conditions often involves the use of motor learning strategies, in which new
movement patterns are taught using repeated trial-and-error practice. However, preliminary data from our lab
suggests that pain may negatively affect the retention of newly learned motor patterns. If correct, this would
suggest that the presence of pain may limit rehabilitation outcomes sought through motor learning-based
interventions. To date, the effects of acute or chronic pain on motor learning have not been thoroughly
investigated in clinical populations. Further, it is not known how pain affects motor learning in older adults
specifically, despite the fact that cognitive declines, which are well-documented in the elderly, could also
negatively affect learning and motor memory. Broadly, the purpose of this research is to investigate the impact
of both acute and chronic pain on locomotor learning and its retention in young and older adults as well as
older adults with chronic low back pain. Our central hypothesis is that both acute and chronic pain impair
retention of locomotor learning and that in older adults, these deficits are worsened and are related to the
degree of cognitive decline. We will investigate this hypothesis with three aims: (1) using our experimental pain
paradigm, to compare effects of acute pain on retention of locomotor learning in healthy young and healthy
older adults; (2) to determine whether older adults with chronic low back pain have impaired retention of
locomotor learning; and (3) to assess relationships between chronic pain, cognition, and motor learning
retention capacity in older adults. Motor learning and its retention will be assessed using our novel visually-
driven locomotor learning paradigm. Several aspects of cognition will be quantified with a cognitive battery,
with special focus on attention and working memory. Finally, pain will be quantified with assessments of
intensity, interference and sensitivity. Results from this work will provide much needed data concerning the
relationship between pain and motor learning in older adult clinical populations. Given that many rehabilitation
interventions utilize motor learning-based strategies to recover normal movement patterns, gaining this new
knowledge is likely to fundamentally improve delivery of rehabilitation in multiple patient populations that
experience pain."

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a rare, debilitating and fatal disease for which there is currently no
available cure. There is compelling evidence that NAD-dependent signaling via NAMPT is a novel and
therapeutic target for PAH. To facilitate the translation of current in vivo and in vitro observations on the
role of NAMPT dependent signaling in PAH pathobiology, this proposal will explore the hypothesis that the
NAMPT/NAD signaling axis regulates physiologic, cellular and molecular pathways in PAH that result in
pulmonary vascular remodeling. SA1 seeks to define the role of pulmonary artery endothelial cell NAMPT in
the regulation on metabolic reprograming associated with the PH response. SA2 define the role of NAMPT in
regulating mitochondrial dynamics in pulmonary artery endothelial cells. SA3 will seek discover and validate
biochemical and genetic NAMPT-centric biomarkers of PAH susceptibility and prognosis."
10773833,"Project Summary
The proposed project will examine the mechanisms by which ethanol-related dementia is greater in older
subjects. We live in a rapidly aging society which as been designed the “Silver Tsunami” of individuals aged 65
or older (i.e. advanced age, aged). Accordingly, the number of chronic diseases, including age-related dementia,
is increasing and 90% of dementia cases are sporadic and driven by environmental cues. Approximately forty
percent of aged adults consume alcohol and the prevalence of binge drinking in older adults is on the rise.
Despite these trends, there are significant gaps in knowledge related to the health impacts of alcohol use and
misuse in individuals with advanced age; this proposal aims to fill these gaps in knowledge. Chronic inflammation
is a critical driving factor of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline and is independently increased by both age
and alcohol. We and others hypothesize that heightened inflammatory responses predisposing older individuals
to alcohol-induced end organ damage is at least partly attributed to the effects of low-grade chronic inflammation
that increases with age, termed ""inflamm-aging."" Because both inflamm-aging and alcohol independently and
negatively impact the resident macrophages in the brain, the microglia, is our working hypothesis that relative to
young, older subjects have heightened inflammatory responses that fail to resolve, leading to excessive systemic
and neuroinflammation and damage to critical organs like the brain. Accordingly, the associated hippocampal
damage will drive accelerated cognitive decline and early onset dementia. In this proposal, we will explore how
age and alcohol impact the expression of regulatory miRNAs in microglia, and determine if these changes result
as 1) a direct effect of ethanol toxicity and 2) an indirect effect via the gut-brain axis. To investigate the role of
alcohol and age on neuroinflammatory responses, in Aim1 we will make use of a novel mouse model of binge
ethanol exposure to establish the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on disease progression and early onset dementia
in aged mice. We will also make use of primary microglia from young and aged mice and profile the
microRNA/mRNA landscape in response to in vivo ethanol exposure. In Aim 2, we will examine the role of
miR223 as an important regulatory factor modulating inflammatory responses in microglia and will establish if
gene therapy replacement of miR223 will prevent ethanol-induced neuroinflammation and dementia in aged
mice. Finally, Aim 3 will focus on the gut-brain axis and will be able, for the first time, to monitor age-related shifts
in the microbiome and determine if age-related intestinal dysbiosis can predispose neuroinflammatory responses
to alcohol, via elevated systemic inflammation and changes to regulatory miRNAs in microglia. These studies
will expand our understanding of how components of “inflamm-aging” lead to dysregulated miRNA profiles in
immunomodulatory components in the brain, which are critical sensitizing factors during bouts of ethanol
exposure and withdrawal. Importantly, this work may highlight/discover novel targets leading to the development
of therapeutic strategies to improve or prevent early onset dementia in patients of all ages."

Inorganic arsenic (iAs) produces significant reproductive toxicity in adult males leading to decreased sperm
quality. Aside from workplace exposure, individuals are exposed to high levels of iAs near hazardous waste sites
and in geographic areas enriched with iAs. A recent study revealed that transient prenatal exposure to a high
dose of iAs impaired sperm quality in multiple generations. However, it is not known whether paternal exposures
to environmentally relevant dose of iAs during adolescence or early-life (gestation to weaning) produce adverse
inheritable reproductive outcomes. We posit that adolescence and early-life are windows of susceptibility during
which exposure to iAs negatively impacts not only the individuals being exposed but also their offspring. However,
the molecular mechanisms mediating paternal intergenerational transmission of exposure-induced traits remain
unclear. Recently, sperm-borne small-RNAs and their specific 5'-methylcytosine (m5C) modifications were shown
to mediate the paternal transmission of diet-induced disorders. Yet, similar studies on environmental toxicants such
as iAs are absent. In our pilot study, we discovered iAs-induced changes in pseudouridine (Ψ) and m5C abundance
in sperm small-RNAs. Ψ and m5C were found to be the most abundant RNA modifications in sperm small-RNAs,
and we hypothesize that these modifications mediate the paternal inheritance of poor sperm quality associated
with iAs exposure, particularly during the developmental windows of adolescence (Aim 1) and early life (gestation
to weaning) (Aim 2). We will determine if adolescent (Aim 1A) and early-life (Aim 2A) iAs exposure are windows
of susceptibility conferring the intergenerational inheritance of impaired sperm quality. We will identify the
mediating role of sperm small-RNAs and their modifications, Ψ and m5C, in adolescent (Aim 1B) and early-life
(Aim 2B) exposure-induced paternal inheritance of impaired sperm quality by performing zygotic microinjection
(ZI) of sperm small-RNA isolated from exposed or control mice to generate offspring from naïve zygotes. We
expect the offspring of the adolescent exposure group to have poorer sperm quality, as in exposed fathers and
sons produced by natural mating. To validate the functional role of specific modifications in our sperm phenotype
inheritance model, we will isolate Ψ- and m5C-enriched sperm small-RNA fractions by RNA immunoprecipitation
for zygotic microinjection. We will determine if microinjection of specific modification-enriched sperm small-RNAs
during adolescent (Aim 1C) and early-life (Aim 2C) can reproduce the paternal sperm phenotype. We expect the
ZI-produced offspring exposed to Ψ- or m5C-enriched sperm small-RNAs from adolescent and/or early-life
exposure groups can recapitulate the poor sperm quality phenotypes. We will use Nanopore native RNAseq to
map sperm Ψ and m5C modifications and identify small-RNA populations associated with the exposure window-
specific intergenerational inheritance. Finally, we will correlate RNA epitranscriptomic and transcriptomic
changes with the intergenerational effects of adolescent/early-life iAs exposure on sperm quality."

High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGS-OvCa) is the most malignant form of ovarian cancer. Among the
most aggressive HGS-OvCa tumors are those that harbor genomic amplification and overexpression of CCNE1,
the gene that encodes for cyclin E1, a key cell cycle regulator. This challenging HGS-OvCa subset carries poor
outcomes after standard cytotoxic chemotherapy, and is associated with high proliferative rate, rapid
development of platinum resistance, and de novo resistance to poly ADP (ribose) polymerase inhibitors. Despite
intense efforts, targeted therapies for the treatment of CCNE1-amplified HGS-OvCa remain elusive, in part, due
to the paucity of druggable molecular targets. As such there remains an urgent unmet medical need for the
development of new therapies for CCNE1-amplified HGS-OvCa and other cancers marked by CCNE1
overexpression. Promising preclinical evidence demonstrates that knockdown or inhibition of cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK2), the catalytic kinase partner of cyclin E1, selectively kills CCNE1-amplified ovarian cancer cell
lines, highlighting a potential dependency associated with CCNE1 amplification. However, efforts to directly
target CDK2 with pharmacological agents have been plagued by difficulties in achieving specificity for CDK2.
We recently employed an alternative strategy of selectively inhibiting CDK7, a key upstream activator of CDK2,
to achieve selective killing of CCNE1-amplified ovarian cancer cells. In proof-of-principle studies, YKL-5-124, a
new CDK7 inhibitor with superior selectivity over existing inhibitors of its kind, led to pronounced tumor shrinkage
in a human xenograft mouse models of CCNE1-amplified HGS-OvCa. The primary goal of the proposed research
is to expand on our preliminary findings by elucidating the underlying principles governing CCNE1-amplified
HGS-OvCa sensitivity to CDK7 inhibition. This knowledge will then be leveraged to guide further preclinical
inquiry into targeting CDK7 in CCNE1-amplified HGS-OvCa. Herein we propose to identify (1) HGS-OvCa
cancer cells and genetic backgrounds that are sensitive to YKL-5-124; (2) biomarkers that correlate with drug
response; and (3) combination strategies that augment or expand drug response (Aim 1). While YKL-5-124
displays potent in vivo activity in mice, we will continue to optimize these CDK7 inhibitors for improved
pharmacokinetics to further the preclinical development of this chemical series (Aim 2). Lastly, we will evaluate
YKL-5-124 (or a further in vivo optimized analog) in mouse models of CCNE1-amplified and non-amplified HGS-
OvCa (Aim 3). To accomplish these goals we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in
medicinal chemistry (Nathanael Gray, Stanford); cell and systems biology (Caitlin Mills and Peter Sorger,
Harvard Medical School); mouse models in ovarian cancer (Panagiotis Konstantinopoulos, DFCI); and
translational and clinical ovarian research (Ursula Matulonis, DFCI). This research describes a new approach to
selectively target CCNE1-overexpressing tumors and identifies novel small-molecules that will enable the
preclinical evaluation of this strategy for the treatment of CCNE1-amplified HGS-OvCa."
10775690,"Slow walking speed is highly prevalent among Veterans beginning in midlife. It is a major predictor of
functional independence, independent of disease status and a predictor for subsequent hospitalization,
disability and death. While rehabilitative care is the standard treatment for those with slow gait speed, the
optimal mode of treatment is not yet identified. We have strong clinical support that a new model of physical
therapy care known as Live Long Walk Strong (LLWS) may be an efficacious treatment for those screened
with slow gait speed. LLWS is highly innovative, as it prioritizes unconventional treatment targets not typically
addressed in standard care, including impairments in: 1) leg power; 2) trunk muscle endurance; 3) gait
coordination (smoothness of walking); and 4) self-efficacy to engage in exercise. Through prior research, we
identified that each of these four therapeutic targets are linked to mobility decline when impaired and that
improvements in each alone can lead to mobility gains that surpasses standard care. No treatment targeting
these attributes collectively is established, though LLWS is conceptually designed to do so. [Thus, we propose
a phase II randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) among Veterans 50 years and older to identify if LLWS
care enhances these attributes and if by augmenting each, sustained improvements in gait speed result.]
 In a civilian-based clinical demonstration project, clinical proof of concept of LLWS was observed.
LLWS targeted community-dwelling older adults. At the completion of LLWS care, we observed large
improvements in mobility performance that exceeded clinically meaningful differences. These differences were
observed even after accounting for health factors that may mitigate rehabilitative gains. [LLWS has great
significance for the VA, because slow gait speed is prevalent in middle aged Veterans and improvements of
the magnitude we observed are predictive lower health care costs and disability. However, while LLWS was
clinically conceived to improve gait speed by enhancing each of these attributes, it is critical to know if two
basic suppositions are true: 1) Are each of these four attributes improved by LLWS? and 2) Do these
improvements induce immediate and sustained changes in gait speed among veterans beginning in midlife?
Therefore, this study will establish efficacy and proof of concept of LLWS among Veterans beginning in midlife;
an age-range largely ignored in prior clinical trials targeting gait speed.]
 LLWS has tremendous relevance for the VA. [For example, in our preliminary work among 174 Veteran
primary care patients aged 50-98, >50% manifested a gait speed < 1.0 m/s, a speed indicating a heightened
risk for adverse health outcomes.] Given Veteran’s higher levels of impairment compared to aged matched
civilians, care should be as parsimonious and efficacious as possible. Thus, the major goal of this proposal is
to establish LLWS as a non-invasive, new therapy targeting slow gait speed across a variety of VHA settings.
 In the proposed phase II RCT, we will recruit [198 community-dwelling, Veterans 50 years and older]
from the outpatient clinics of the VA Boston Healthcare system that manifest slow gait speed (< 1.0 m/s) and
randomize them to either 8 weeks of LLWS or 8 weeks of usual care for those with slow gait speed after which
LLWS will be initiated for 8 weeks. Both groups will be followed for outcomes 16 weeks after LLWS treatment
ends. [The primary outcome for all 3 aims will be change in usual gait speed. Secondary outcomes will include
changes in the targeted attributes after 8 weeks of treatment.]
 We will address these aims:
[Aim 1: To conduct a phase II RCT of LLWS in comparison to controls and evaluate its efficacy among
community dwelling Veterans 50 years and older.
Aim 2: Evaluate the attributes that lead to improved gait speed after 8 weeks of LLWS treatment.
Aim 3: Identify the attributes that are associated with sustained gait speed gains 16 weeks after LLWS ends.]"
10775692,"Project Summary
Alternative polyadenylation (APA) generates highly diverse transcriptome and proteome in the brain to
maintain proper neurological functions. Recent works from others and us revealed a complex and dynamic
APA landscape in the brain with many cell type-specific APA regulations and an emerging role of APA in
neurological disease. However, APA alterations in neurological disorders remain largely unexplored and
rigorously designed in vivo high-throughput APA studies in brain disease are especially lacking due to
technical difficulties. We broke the technical barrier in 2017 by developing the cTag-PAPERCLIP technology,
which simultaneously profiles more than 20,000 poly(A) sites in individual cell types from intact mouse brain
and preserves the in vivo transcriptome better than other sequencing strategies that require cell purification.
Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is characterized by activation of the mTORC1 signaling in the brain with severe
neurological symptoms. Interestingly, mTORC1 activation was recently shown to cause global proximal
APA shift through regulating an APA factor in non-brain cells, which suggests that aberrant APA is a
previously unknown cellular phenotype of TSC. In this application, we propose to conduct a proof-of-
principle study in which we apply cTag-PAPERCLIP to investigate APA in TSC by incorporating new tools
that we recently developed. We will identify changes in APA isoform expression in response to acute loss of
Tsc1 and activation of mTORC1 signaling by in vivo cTag-PAPERCLIP profiling in 3 brain cell types:
excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons and astrocytes. We will use our established bioinformatics pipeline to
identify robust and biologically important APA changes in each cell type. We will perform RNA-seq to
provide independent validations for the observed APA changes. APA can alter the cellular signaling network
through production of truncated proteins or loss of 3′ UTR regulation from RNA-binding proteins and
microRNAs. For APA changes predicted to carry such effects, we will experimentally validate the predicted
quantitative or qualitative protein changes in common cell lines and primary neuron cultures. Lastly, we will
also investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for APA changes from mTORC1 activation in
primary neuron cultures. Upon completion of the proposed project, we expect to reveal for the first time how
mTORC1 activation in TSC alters the cellular APA landscapes in excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons and
astrocytes in addition to addressing a key question—how APA dysregulation contributes to TSC
pathogenesis. Our results will also provide new insights into the knowledge and clinical management of
TSC and other neurological disorders with mTOR pathway dysregulation (“mTORopathies”)"
10775809,"Quality survival after brain injury is currently the greatest challenge for critically ill or injured infants and
children. A universal contributor limiting quality survivorship is the devastating impact of hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy (HIE), either as a primary consequence in cases of cardiac arrest, stroke, or intracranial
hemorrhage or as secondary sequelae in cases of status epilepticus, circulatory or septic shock,
neuroinflammation, or traumatic brain injury (TBI); with the principal cause of HIE spanning from infancy
through adolescence a consequence of cardiac arrest. As to-date a cure for HIE has not been discovered, a
paradigm-shifting strategy is likely necessary to improve neurological outcome for victims of HIE.
 Accordingly, we have developed a new class of therapeutics to treat HIE via preservation of critical
cellular energy stores by selectively targeting poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in mitochondria (mtPARP),
linking the mitochondria-targeting moieties hemi-gramicidin S (XJB) or triphenylphosphonium (TPP) to PARP
inhibitors used clinically. Ischemia-induced PARP overactivation triggered by DNA damage consumes NAD+,
generating branch chain poly(ADP-ribose) polymers (PARylation) resulting in ATP depletion, energy failure,
and cell death by necrosis and/or apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF)-mediated parthanatos. As mitochondria are
the major source of ATP and NAD+ in aerobic organisms, preservation of mitochondrial energy stores
represents a logical “druggable” target for mitigation of HIE. We recently reported that the mitochondria-
targeting PARP1 inhibitor XJB-veliparib preserves NAD+ stores and prevents neuronal death after oxygen-
glucose deprivation (OGD) in vitro at nanomolar concentrations. Importantly, XJB-veliparib selectively targets
mitochondria and thereby does not impede nuclear DNA repair in vitro. We present provocative pilot data
suggesting that XJB-veliparib and the readily translatable mitochondria-targeting compound TPP-veliparib may
be efficacious after cardiac arrest in post-natal day (PND) 17 rats, a developmental age equivalent to a young
child and a time associated with peak cerebral metabolism. This new class of therapeutics has the advantage
of preventing PARP-mediated energy failure and cell death by selectively targeting mtPARP while sparing
PARP1-facilitated nuclear DNA repair and provide a tool to definitively establish (or refute) a role for mtPARP
in the pathogenesis of HIE.
 If proven effective, mtPARP1 inhibitors would represent novel, safe (in terms of nuclear DNA repair),
and translatable therapies to mitigate HIE, with special potential in the highly vulnerable, developing brain
where metabolic rate is at its peak."
10775812,"Abstract
Predicting recovery from anoxic brain injury and coma after cardiac arrest is challenging. Although patients
resuscitated from cardiac arrest are intensively monitored in critical care units, clinicians use only a tiny subset
of available data to predict potential for recovery, making neurological prognostication both slow and imprecise.
This is a specific example of a ubiquitous problem in modern medicine: routine clinical monitoring generates
vast quantities of rich information, but tools to transform these data to useful knowledge are lacking.
This project will leverage expertise in post-arrest critical care, information science, statistical modeling and
machine learning to make a system that rapidly delivers actionable prognostic knowledge. We have cleaned,
organized and aggregated a large, highly multivariate time series database with physiological and clinical
information with over 170,000 hours of quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) features for >1,850 post-
arrest patients. We will refine and optimize analytical tools that predict recovery in this patient population more
rapidly and accurately than clinical experts. We will use innovative approaches to minimize risk of bias during
training of models introduced by outcome labels created by fallible human providers.
In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will use novel approaches to create informative and interpretable features from
heterogeneous clinical data including EEG waveforms, vital signs, medications and laboratory test results. We
will use deep learning to identify interpretable and parsimonious sets of these features that predict outcome.
We will train, test and compare the performance of multiple analytical tools. In Aim 2, we will prospectively
compare the best performing model(s) against a panel of expert clinicians. Models that confidently identify
patients with near-zero prospect of recovery with greater sensitivity or faster than expert clinicians can serve as
decision support systems. Improving the speed and accuracy of post-arrest prognostication will save lives,
allow appropriate resources to be directed to patients who are likely to benefit, avoid long and difficult care for
patients who cannot recover, and spare families the agony of uncertainty."
10775817,"Lung cancer has a 5-year survival rate of 21% and more than 80% of all new patients are diagnosed at an
advanced stage. Finding small lung nodules representing the early stages of lung cancer are critical, but
diagnostic error can be as high as 50% in harder-to-detect lung nodules. Nodule detection is the outcome of a
difficult search task which employs both conscious and non-conscious brain processes that radiologists spend
years of training enhancing. Currently, detection is constrained to those processes that become conscious. A
critical need is characterizing and utilizing these non-conscious processes to improve nodule detection beyond
conscious detection limits. This proposed RO1 will use an innovative new paradigm to isolate non-conscious
processes during lung nodule searches in CT images. Using eye-tracking, the project will show clear and
reliable biomarkers of non-conscious detection for “missed” nodules in the absence of any conscious detection
or consideration of the nodule. These biomarkers will be used to train Machine Learning (ML) to detect
“missed” nodules. The innovation of this application is capitalizing on the full expertise of the radiologist by
utilizing these biomarkers of non-conscious detection to develop ML to read the radiologist and not the image;
disrupting the status quo of ML in radiology, and creating ML that can detect “missed” nodules. The central
hypothesis will be tested in three Specific Aims: 1: To evaluate the extent to which identified biomarkers of
non-conscious detection of missed nodules can be used to train and refine ML models to increase nodule
detection; 2: To quantify the extent that feedback of the locations that ML models indicate are missed nodules
can increase nodule detection; and 3: To specify the extent that trained ML models can generalize to a novel set
of radiologists on a novel set of chest CTs to detect missed lung nodules and increase nodule detection. These
Aims will be carried out by testing radiologist on lung nodule searches in CT images using high-speed eye-
tracking and our innovative paradigm that allow us to isolate non-conscious processes during misses and
demonstrate that non-conscious processes are successfully detecting the “missed” nodules. ML models will be
trained on these non-conscious biomarkers to detect “missed” lung nodules. The ML models will provide
significant feedback to the radiologists to reduce the number of nodules missed by the limits of conscious
detection. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide strong scientific justification
for the use of non-conscious processes in diagnostic visual search, and to create ML models capable of
detecting otherwise “missed” lung nodules; hence, changing clinical practice, reducing nodule misses,
improving early detection, and increasing lung cancer's 5-year survival rate."
10772930,"Abstract - This is a renewal of our successful 2019-2023 PREP program. UC Santa Cruz PREP is in its 8th year
and has supported 50 scholars (43 completed training and 6 currently supported). Of our seven cohorts of PREP
scholars that completed training, 3 enrolled in master’s programs, and 32 of 43 (74.4%) have been admitted to
top-ranked biomedical Ph.D. programs throughout the country. Of the 32 accepted into Ph. D.s programs, 34%
have completed their Ph.D. training, 16% have received their Master’s, and are currently in leadership positions
in academia and industry. 50% are at different stages of their doctorate studies. Two honorable mentions and
five scholars received prestigious NSF graduate fellowships. Ten additional scholars received coveted graduate
fellowships at their universities. 19 co-authored peer-reviewed publications were produced by PREP scholars
based on their research at UCSC. The current cohort of 6 scholars has just received numerous graduate school
invitations, and we are optimistic that they will be accepted into Biomedical Ph.D. programs. Of our 50 scholars
(30 female/20 male), 86% were first-generation college students, 8 were African American, 34 were Hispanic, 3
were Southeast Asian, and 3 were Native American. In this renewal application, we plan to maintain the same
class size, admitting yearly cohorts of 6 post-baccalaureate scholars from underserved and underrepresented
minority populations. Based on our extensive involvement with this program, we continue to modify and improve
the PREP experience for our scholars. Specifically, we propose to increase our state and national recruiting
efforts. In addition, we will foster collaborations, retreats, and seminars with the three other Bay Area PREP
programs. While great strides have been made over the past 20 years toward increasing the participation of
historically marginalized groups in science programs at the undergraduate level, similar increases have not been
realized at the doctoral level. The UC Santa Cruz PREP program is well suited to meet this urgent national need
to expand diversity and increase participation of historically marginalized students in Biomedical Ph.D. programs.
The outstanding research environment at UC Santa Cruz will provide PREP scholars with state-of-the-art
resources and faculty who are leaders in their disciplines. Our scholars will also benefit from UCSC’s experience

10746811,"Ischemic stroke is the 4th leading cause of death in the U.S. and a major cause of disability. The etiology
of stroke is multifactorial and poorly understood. Genetics is a potentially powerful tool for better understanding
disease etiology as it can highlight biological mechanisms underlying disease and point the way to improved
prevention, treatment, and outcome. Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of ischemic stroke (IS)
populations have been successful at identifying stroke-risk-associated loci with small effect sizes, however,
the role of copy number variation (CNV) variation in stroke susceptibility has yet to be explored, and is the
premise of our proposal. Studying CNV has revealed important insights for numerous other complex diseases.
Further, we recently demonstrated that a higher CNV burden genome-wide is associated with poorer stroke
outcome at 3 months. We therefore hypothesize that CNV analyses of existing GWAS and exome data will be
a highly effective and cost-efficient methodology to identify novel associations illuminating stroke mechanisms,
treatment targets, and outcome drivers. We further speculate that these analyses will identify CNVs of large
effect size in ischemic stroke, as suggested by the existence of numerous monogenic, syndromic and complex
diseases associated with CNV and that CNV may help explain the ‘missing heritability’ known to exist in stroke.
 For this application, we have already assembled over 24,500 well-phenotyped IS cases, including IS
subtypes, and over 43,500 controls, all with readily available genotyping on GWAS and exome arrays, with
case measures of stroke outcome. To evaluate CNV-associated stroke risk and stroke outcome we will: 1)
perform Risk Discovery using several analytic approaches to identify CNVs that are associated with the risk of
IS and its subtypes, across the age-, sex- and ethnicity-spectrums; 2) perform Risk Replication and Extension
to determine whether the identified stroke-associated CNVs replicate in the ethnically diverse TOPMed
Consortia and then using existing TOPMed and GeneStroke Consortium biomarker data (e.g. methylation,
proteomic, RNA, miRNA, etc.) evaluate how the identified CNVs exert their effects on stroke risk, and lastly;
3) perform outcome-based Replication and Extension analyses of our recent findings demonstrating an inverse
relationship between CNV burden and stroke outcome at 3 months (mRS) in these additional datasets, and
then determine the key CNV drivers responsible for these associations using existing biomarker data.
 Our study will leverage the numerous advantages of using existing case-control data sets, exploring the
relationships between CNV and IS and its subtypes, and outcome at 3 months, across the sex-, age- and
ethnicity-spectrums. The proposed study creates a new training network for junior investigators and establishes
a unique resource for the continued study of the genetic basis of IS. The successful identification of novel
genes, pathways and drug targets has the potential to transform our understanding of the stroke
pathophysiology leading to more effective prevention, treatment and outcome strategies."
10749898,"Molecular features associated with time-to-event outcomes, such as overall or disease-free survival, may be
prognostically relevant or potential therapeutic targets. Therefore, analyzing data from high-throughput genomic
assays with clinical follow-up data has been of growing interest. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Project has
collected baseline demographic, clinical characteristics, and follow-up data for 11,125 patients for 32 different
cancer types and corresponding tissue samples were processed for examining SNPs, copy number, methylation,
miRNA expression, and mRNA expression. Because the number of variables (P ) exceeds the sample size (N),
one strategy frequently employed when associating molecular features to survivorship data is to ﬁt univariable
Cox proportional hazards (PH) models followed by adjustment for multiple hypothesis tests using a false discovery
rate approach. However, most chronic conditions and diseases, including cancer, are likely caused by multiple
dysregulated genes or mutations. It is therefore critical to ﬁt multivariable models in the presence of a high-
dimensional covariate space. Traditional statistical methods cannot be used when the number of features exceeds
the sample size (e.g., P > N), though penalized methods perform automatic variable selection and accommodate
the P > N scenario. Penalized approaches including LASSO, smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD),
adaptive LASSO, and Bayesian LASSO have all been extended to Cox's PH model for handling high-dimensional
covariate spaces. However, when modeling survival or other time-to-event outcomes, the Cox PH model assumes
that all subjects will experience the event of interest, which is violated when a subset of subjects are cured.
Instead, when a subset of subjects in the data are cured, mixture cure models should be ﬁt. Although mixture
cure models have been described for traditional settings where the number of samples exceeds the number
of covariates, limited variable selection methods and no methods for high-dimensional model ﬁtting currently
exist for mixture cure models. Therefore, this project will overcome a critical barrier to progress in this ﬁeld
by developing penalized parametric and semi-parametric mixture cure models applicable for high-dimensional
datasets. The speciﬁc aims of this application are to: (1) Develop penalized parametric mixture cure models
for high-dimensional datasets; and (2) Develop a penalized semi-parametric proportional hazards mixture cure
model for high-dimensional datasets. For both aims we will characterize the performance of the methods using
extensive simulation studies, develop software, and distribute R packages to CRAN. In aim (3) we will identify
molecular features associated with cure and survival using our large unique AML dataset from the Alliance for
Clinical Trials in Oncology and assess robustness of ﬁndings using AML datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus
and The Cancer Genome Atlas project. This research will ﬁll a critical gap as there are currently no mixture cure
models for high-dimensional data. We anticipate application of our methods to our AML data will enhance existing
risk stratiﬁcation systems used in daily clinical practice that determine treatment intensity and modality."
10749899,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Metastatic colorectal cancers (CRC) are the second leading cause of cancer death in the US. While advances
in targeted therapies have transformed the treatment of many cancers, CRC has proven largely refractory to this
approach. Thus, while agents targeting BRAFV600E and the KRASG12C mutation have dramatically improved the
treatment of lung cancer and melanoma, they have only shown limited impact in CRC.
CTNNB1 transcription is upregulated in >75% of CRC via APC inactivation and other mutations. As CTNNB1 is
a common mediator of drug resistance and has been shown to be sufficient to maintain CRC proliferation, we
hypothesize that it is a key mediator of intrinsic resistance to KRAS inhibition in CRC. Although multiple agents
target CTNNB1 regulation via the WNT pathway, these have proven too toxic for human use to date.
Thus, we have used proteomics to map the signaling response to KRASG12C inhibition in CRC cell lines and
kinome-wide knockdown to identify kinases whose suppression synergizes with KRASG12C inhibition. By
integrating these two approaches, we were able to uncover several kinases that function as signaling links
between KRAS and CTNNB1, and whose inhibition synergizes with direct KRAS inhibition to reduce CTNNB1
target gene expression. As KRASG12C inhibitors do not impact normal KRAS signaling, this exciting preliminary
data suggests that we may be able to preferentially downregulate CTNNB1 in tumors without systemic toxicity.
We will build on this key preliminary data in this project: In Aim 1, we will expand our analysis of the kinase
response to KRASG12C inhibition to additional CRC cell lines and the assess the impact of key kinases on
CTNNB1 transcription. In Aim 2, we will use CRISPR in patient-derived xenografts (PDX) to circumvent the
limitations of available small molecules to validate the role of CTNNB1 in APC-mutant CRC PDX. We will further
use CRISPR or small molecules (when available) to test kinases already found to modulate CTNNB1 or emerging
from Aim 1 in CRC treatment models and to determine their role in in vivo CRC biology. Finally, in Aim 3 we will
develop KRASG12C CRC organoid and cell line models with mutations in PIK3CA, a common CRC mutation that
co-occurs with KRAS mutations and is likely to cause resistance to KRASG12C inhibitors, but for which there are
no models currently available. These tools will allow us to stratify the impact of PIK3CA mutation on our current
treatment strategies and to optimize a regimen engineered specifically for this combination of mutations.
This rigorous study of KRAS-driven signaling in CRC leverages new small molecules and robust quantitative
approaches to unmask links between KRAS and the mechanisms that support CRC after KRAS inhibition.
Uncovering the basis of resistance to direct KRAS inhibition in CRC will yield rational combination strategies
primed for translation into clinical trials."

Little is known about virulence mechanisms for most emerging fungal pathogens. Coccidioides immitis and C.
posadasii, are of specific concern due to rapid increase in disease (coccidioidomycosis, aka Valley fever)
incidence in the US, with a more than 10-fold increase in reported disease over the last 20 years. The Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that average cost for treating Valley fever is $50,000 per patient,
including extensive hospital stays and treatment regimes. Use of CRISPR/Cas9 and functional assessment of
targeted gene deletion on virulence can help improve our understanding of mechanisms of pathogenicity and
represent the foundational framework that is necessary for development of these approaches. We propose to
functionally delete 10 gene targets in Coccidioides posadasii strain Silveira and assay these deletions for loss of
virulence. We will further investigate pathogenicity in C. immitis strain RS for those genes that show a loss of
virulence. Currently, few specific mechanisms of virulence have been investigated in Coccidioides. Analysis of
these data will provide new insights into functions of Coccidioides genes, which will increase our understanding
of fungal pathogenesis mechanisms. Finally, we will work to develop tools to engineer fluorescently labeled live
strains for Coccidioides using mCherry expression that will increase tools for interrogating host:pathogen
interactions in an in vitro cell culture assay. In total, this proposal represents needed improvements in functional
assessment of virulence in an important, yet understudied, fungal pathogen."

Justice-involved youth (JIY) living in the community experience disproportionately high rates of suicidal thoughts
and behavior (STB) and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) compared to adolescents in the general population. Many
JIY lack access to evidence-based treatment specifically designed to treat NNSI and STB, thereby increasing
the overall risk of suicide in this population. Further, even when JIY do have access to evidence-based treatment,
treatment initiation in this population is low. The current proposal aims to reduce STB and NSSI among JIY, and
thus reduce mental health disparities in this vulnerable and underserved youth population. Our primary aim is to
implement a systems-level intervention designed to increase access to evidence-based treatment strategies
specifically designed to treat STB and NSSI behaviors for JIY referred to outpatient care by the Rhode Island
Family Court. We will conduct a cluster randomized stepped wedge trial in which 9 distinct community mental
health agencies (CMHA) who serve JIY in the state of Rhode Island will be randomized to receive a standardized
training program. A select number of CHMA administrators and providers will complete semi-structured
qualitative interviews pre-implementation to assess agency/system-level and provider-level factors that may
promote or hinder the uptake of evidenced-based treatment strategies for STB and NSSI in CMHAs serving JIY
living in the community. Quantitative data will assess organizational, provider, and youth characteristics and will
be collected through questionnaires CMHA providers complete and from the electronic medical record pre-
implementation, immediately post-implementation, and 9-months into sustainment. It is hypothesized that at the
systems level, the training program will be sustained for at least one year and up to 3 years by CMHA
administrators. At the provider level, it is hypothesized that training in the use of evidence-based treatment
strategies for STB and NSSI will significantly increase both the use of these strategies and the quality of their
delivery over a year’s follow-up period. At the patient level, we hypothesize that the training program will improve
parental adherence to outpatient treatment and reduce rates of adolescent STB and NSSI that require
emergency medical/psychiatric care in our healthcare system. Our secondary aim is to examine factors that
influence treatment initiation among JIY living in the community. We will enroll 180 caregivers of JIY youth who
screen positive for recent NSSI/STB to test the hypothesis that JIY whose caregivers are randomized to the
psychoeducation/action plan condition, compared to an educational video, will be significantly more likely to
initiate treatment at a CMHA. Caregivers will complete follow-up assessments at 3- and 6-months post-baseline
to assess whether their adolescent initiated treatment and how many sessions the adolescent attended. This
application has strongly aligns with NIMH’s Strategic Objective 3.3: “Test interventions for effectiveness in
community practice settings,” and the goals of the RFA-MH-21-187 to test effective “systems-level strategies for
the detection and prevention of SIB and/or NSSI specifically among underserved children and adolescents.”"

Prevention of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (HIV-NCI) remains elusive, despite the efficacy of
cART in suppressing viral replication within the CNS. Although cART initiated immediately after HIV infection
(INSIGHT START study) profoundly reduced disease progression, there was no neurocognitive advantage
over delayed cART. Acute brain injury occurs within weeks of infection (HIV, SIV), before cART suppression is
typically achieved. Spontaneous limited recovery may occur thereafter, suggesting a therapeutic window for
rapid-acting neuroprotective treatments. These have not yet been tested. Our overall objective is to determine
the ability of a rapidly-assimilated neuroprotective drug (dimethyl fumarate/DMF, FDA-approved), in
combination with cART, to reduce injury and promote recovery in acute SIV infection in rhesus macaques.
SIV/HIV injury is linked to oxidative stress and inflammation, which DMF can target through enhancing Nrf2-
driven antioxidant enzyme expression and associated antioxidative/anti-inflammatory pathways. In our human
brain autopsy studies, HIV-NCI associated with reduced expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an
antioxidant enzyme with two isoforms (HO-1 and -2), and with increased neuroinflammation. Moreover, HIV
infection without HIV-NCI associated with increased HO-1 levels, consistent with a neuroprotective role for HO.
In a separate cohort of persons living with HIV (PWH), we showed that an HO-1 promoter variation ((GT)n
dinucleotide repeat)) that enhances HO-1 expression, associates with lower neuroinflammation and lower HIV-
NCI risk. In acute HIV infection (in vitro) we showed that DMF induces HO-1 and other Nrf2 antioxidant
enzymes in infected macrophages, and reduces TNF and glutamate release, thus linking enhanced enzyme
expression with neuroprotection. In acute SIV infection in rhesus macaques, we defined a potential therapeutic
window for DMF enhancement of antioxidant responses. We identified unique patterns of acute synaptic injury
linked to low antioxidant enzyme levels, and changes in expression. Brainstem injury associated with higher
neuroinflammation, lower enzyme levels, and progressive loss of HO-2. Recovery associated with stable HO-2
and increasing HO-1 levels. In our pilot macaque treatment study, DMF induced brain antioxidant enzymes,
including HO-1, reduced oxidation of DNA and proteins, and produced a less-oxidized brain redox state. These
findings support testing DMF as an adjunct to early cART. We hypothesize that DMF therapy concurrently with
cART in acute SIV infection will reduce oxidative stress and acute neuronal injury while enhancing neuronal
recovery throughout the brain. We will determine effects of concurrent DMF/cART on: (Aim 1) regional brain,
oxidative injury, inflammation, neuronal integrity, signaling and recovery, and association with plasma markers
of injury, oxidative stress and microbial translocation; (Aim 2) brain localization of immune cell infiltration, cell
activation and oxidative injury in immune, endothelial, glial, and neuronal subtypes; and (Aim 3) infiltration of
SIV-infected immune cells in brain and lymphatic tissue, in acute SIV infection of rhesus macaques."
10783759,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Physical frailty (hereafter simplified to “frailty”) refers to a clinical state associated with an
individual’s increased risk of dependence or mortality when exposed to a stressor and has
emerged as a major predictor of poor health outcomes in the elderly. Unfortunately, the
mechanisms contributing to the exacerbation of normal aging that precipitates frailty are largely
unknown. In this regard, recent epidemiological studies find that elevated circulating levels of
kynurenine, a product of tryptophan metabolism that accumulates in blood with aging, strongly
associate with poor physical function and elevated risk of frailty. However, a causal relationship
between elevated kynurenine and poor physical function/frailty has not been tested. Our
preliminary data show that kynurenine causes atrophy and impaired mitochondrial function in
skeletal muscle cells that can be rescued by increasing the capacity for kynurenine
biotransformation into the neuroprotective metabolite, kynurenic acid. Since kynurenine is also an
agonist of the ligand-activated transcription factor known as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR),
it is noteworthy that we find that transcripts regulated by the AHR are upregulated in aging muscle,
and that AHR knockdown blunts kynurenine-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Finally, we also
show that chronic AHR activity alone is sufficient to induce atrophy, mitochondrial dysfunction and
neuromuscular junction degeneration in young mice, which are hallmarks of aging that are
exacerbated in frailty. On this basis, the first goal of this project is to determine if elevated
kynurenine levels accelerate the physical function decline and frailty with aging in mice. Secondly,
we will determine if enhancing kynurenine metabolism attenuates the decline of physical function
and frailty with aging in mice, with or without elevated kynurenine. Thirdly, we will test if knockout
of the AHR attenuates the decline of physical function and frailty with aging in mice, with or without
elevated kynurenine. Finally, we will test if chronic AHR activity in muscle alone is sufficient to
accelerate physical function decline and frailty with aging in mice. By doing so, our studies will lay
the foundation for future testing of therapies that augment kynurenine metabolism and/or inhibit
the AHR as a means of attenuating frailty with aging."
10772011,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is projected to double in prevalence by 2040 and yet there are no current therapeutic
approaches that delay or stop disease progression. A broad role for leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)
mutations in familial and idiopathic PD has emerged, elevating its status to a central disease target. Ultimately,
prevention of LRRK2 neurotoxicity will require a detailed understanding of the key mechanisms driving
neurodegeneration. One of the most frequent neuronal defects associated with the common LRRK2 G2019S
mutation in vitro is a loss of neurite length and complexity. Yet, the nature of these defects in vivo, their
underlying cause, and their relationship to dopamine neuron death are all unknown. This creates a major
roadblock to understanding disease etiology. An unbiased screen for genetic modifiers of LRRK2 G2019S
neurodegeneration lead to the discovery of three genes; prospero, cut and pbl, which all have roles in neurite
outgrowth and maintenance. This generates the hypothesis that prospero, cut and pbl drive LRRK2 G2019S-
induced dopaminergic neurite defects, and that these defects are necessary and sufficient for dopamine
neuron death in aged animals. In the proposed studies, the impact of LRRK2 G2019S on dopaminergic neurite
growth and maintenance across aging in Drosophila will be determined using conditional transgenics that
overexpress LRRK2 G2019S. LRRK2 G2019S expression will be induced either throughout the life span or
restricted to development or aging to determine how this impacts dopaminergic neurite defects observed in
aged flies. Mechanisms involving prospero, cut and pbl in LRRK2 G2019S neurite defects through altered
cytoskeletal regulation and their role in neuronal death will be examined. The contribution of the mammalian
orthologs of prospero (PROX1), cut (CUX1) and pbl (ECT2) to substantia nigra dopamine neuron loss will be
assessed in a rat adenoviral model of LRRK2 G2019S-induced neurodegeneration. Successful completion of
the proposed research will contribute to the understanding of (i) molecular mechanisms of LRRK2 G2019S-
induced neurite defects in vivo (ii) the nature of these defects across development and aging in vivo (iii)
whether these defects are necessary and sufficient for age-related dopamine neuron death and (iv) whether
the mammalian orthologs of the identified modifiers also contribute to LRRK2 G2019S neurodegeneration. This
contribution is expected to be significant because it will provide a major advance in understanding the
mechanisms driving LRRK2 G2019S neurodegeneration in PD. This proposal incorporates a number of
conceptual and technological innovations to achieve a detailed study of the nature and mechanisms of LRRK2-
related neurite defects, their dynamics across aging and their connection to established PD-related
phenotypes."
10772043,"Adaptive control of cognitive behaviors in response to changes in uncertainty about future rewards is
fundamental for survival. It is not surprising that uncertainty-related maladaptive behaviors, such as
maladaptive risk seeking or avoidance, are observed in a wide range of psychiatric disorders. But, to date, the
neural mechanisms of uncertainty-mediated risk seeking or risk avoidance are unclear. And, anatomically
targeted treatments for many risk-related behavioral states have not been developed. The overarching goal of
the current renewal is to uncover the neuronal and behavioral mechanisms of risky decision making under
uncertainty. Aim 1 will uncover the mechanisms by which single neurons regulate risky decisions under
uncertainty. Our previous work showed that the ventral pallidum (VP) transmits a risk signal before risky
decisions. This raised crucial new questions. How does VP compute its risk signal? What is its function in
decision making? We hypothesize that VP computes the subjective value of risk in order to govern risk-
reward tradeoffs in decision making, and that decision making is controlled by a major recipient of VP
projections - the lateral habenula (LhB). Aim 1 will (i) test among leading mechanistic accounts of risky
behavior and assess how the subjective value of risk is governed by distinct forms of reward uncertainty and
by reward timing, (ii) determine whether VP neurons' activity is necessary and sufficient to control decision
making under uncertainty via these mechanisms, and (iii) determine whether and how VP risky decision related
activity is reflected in the LHb. Preliminary data indicate that risky decisions arise due to a change in subjective
value of risk mediated by uncertainty-sensitive neurons in the VP, and that representations of total subjective
value ultimately guide choice through the LhB, downstream of VP. Aim 2 will shed light on the behavioral
and neuronal mechanisms through which risk tolerance and value-based decision making are
mediated by time. We found that monkeys' behavior closely resembled human decision making: monkeys are
more willing to accept risks when they can resolve the resulting uncertainty early instead of having to live with
the uncertainty for a prolonged time, and this risk tolerance was reflected in VP and LhB neurons. We
hypothesize that timing information that is computationally necessary to control this risk tolerance is encoded in
dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) – a modulatory input to VP and LhB. Aim 2 will (i) characterize how neurons in
DRN process the timing- and uncertainty-related variables that govern risk tolerance and (ii) transiently
manipulate population activity in the DRN to assess the impact on decisions. Preliminary data show that DRN
neurons encode information about time and uncertainty in a manner that is sufficient to control risk tolerance.
The Aims offer an unprecedented opportunity to (i) understand the mechanisms of risky decision-making and
(ii) study the neuronal activity in brain areas tightly linked to psychiatric disorders that have not been studied in
during decision making in the closest animal model to human beings."
10772103,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Methylation of cytosine in the context of CpG dinucleotides is an essential and highly conserved chromatin
modification. It plays a critical role in gene regulation, cell differentiation and organismal development. Aberrant
patterns of DNA methylation are commonly observed in human diseases including cancer. CpG islands (CGIs),
regions with a high frequency of CpG sites found at the promoters of ~40% mammalian genes, are devoid of
DNA methylation in normal tissues but become hypermethylated in tumors, leading to the silencing of many
tumor suppressor genes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CGI hypermethylation in cancer
remain poorly understood, and therefore therapeutic strategies that specifically target CGI hypermethylation are
lacking. DNA methylation is established by the DNMT3 family of de novo DNA methyltransferases. The DNMT3
family includes two catalytically active members, DNMT3A and DNMT3B. DNMT3A has two splice variants
DNMT3A1 and DNMT3A2. While DNMT3A2 and DNMT3B are expressed during early development, DNMT3A1
is the main de novo DNA methyltransferase expressed in differentiated tissues. We and others have previously
demonstrated that DNMT3A1 contains regulatory domains interacting with histone post-translational
modifications (PTMs) to guide its genomic targeting to regions marked by H3K36 di- and tri-methylation
(H3K36me2/3). Our collaborative preliminary studies have identified an additional functional domain unique to
DNMT3A1 that facilitates its interaction with histone H2AK119 mono-ubiquitination (H2AK119Ub), a PTM
catalyzed by Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1). These findings resonate with meta-analyses of patient
tumor samples, which revealed a strong correlation between CGIs that gain methylation in cancers and those
regulated by Polycomb complexes in normal tissues. We will pursue a hypothesis that the redistribution of
DNMT3A1 from H3K36 methylation to H2AK119ub-marked CGIs drives CGI hypermethylation and neoplastic
transformation. To test this hypothesis, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach that leverages the
complementary expertise of Armache and Lu labs, spanning from chromatin biochemistry, structural study to
cancer biology and epigenomics. These studies will reveal the molecular mechanisms of DNMT3A1 regulation
by H3K36 methylation and H2AK119Ub and uncover how the balance between these PTMs mediates the
recruitment, activity and function of DNMT3A1 in healthy tissues and tumors. Expected results will provide an
enhanced understanding of the dynamics, cause and consequence of CGI hypermethylation – a molecular
hallmark of human cancers that remains a key focus of the field. Furthermore, they will lay the foundation for
developing inhibitors that target the interaction of DNMT3A1 with H2AK119Ub to specifically reverse cancer-
associated CGI hypermethylation, which are expected to show less toxicity compared to current FDA-approved
unspecific DNA hypomethylating agents."
10772146,"This proposal aims to develop a first non-cryogenic fieldable multichannel system to enable interleaved
measurements of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the ultra-low field (ULF) regime (<< 1 T) and magneto-
encephalography (MEG) of the human brain. The combination of the two modalities is uniquely capable of linking
the sources of biomagnetic brain activity (MEG) to the specific anatomical brain structure (ULF MRI) with both
excellent temporal and spatial resolution. In addition, the combination essentially eliminates co-registration errors
based on the common MEG-MRI coordinate system. This advanced biomedical technology will enhance
understanding of human brain function, aid in diagnosis and treatment of multiple brain disorders such as the
epileptic focus, and improve neurosurgical planning. Previously, the MEG-MRI combination was realized only
using multiple cryogenic superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) sensors. However, the demand
for cryo-cooling and a shielded room is a major drawback. We will build a more practical device by replacing
SQUIDs with a novel type of atomic magnetometers (AMs). Based on lasers and alkali-metal vapor cells, AMs
are currently the most sensitive cryogen-free magnetic sensors. Specific aims are to: (1) Develop an original
compact 16-channel AM module for MEG. It delivers a large number of sensing channels based on a single large
vapor cell and two broad nearly parallel laser beams. This new approach leads to significant cost reduction
compared to commercial SQUID-based MEG systems. (2) Construct a wearable full-head MEG helmet. We will
produce 15–20 compact AM MEG modules for mounting on a helmet for full-head coverage with up to 320
channels. Due to the laser-to-fiber coupling, the module positions will be adjustable for different head geometries
for closer proximity of sensors to the head. This will result in improved localization and sensitivity. We will obtain
functional brain maps with the MEG helmet. (3) Construct a new multichannel ULF MRI device based on a single-
module multichannel AM coupled to multiple flux transformers (FTs). For MRI, the AM design will be modified to
allow orthogonal laser beams, and a bias magnetic field will be applied to tune the AM to target MRI frequencies
of ~200 kHz. Each FT will be composed of two connected coils, one located near the human head and the other
near the AM vapor cell, to transfer MRI signals to the AM. The FT coils can be flexibly arranged around the
human head to enhance an MRI signal. We will demonstrate ULF MRI measurements of the human head with
an optimized FT array. (4) Combine the full-head MEG helmet and the ULF MRI device in a single instrument.
The combination will be achieved by attaching the MRI FT coils to the MEG helmet. The device will be installed
in a shielded room for a proof of feasibility and then in a human-sized cylindrical mu-metal magnetic shield for
enabling mobile applications. We will perform interleaved imaging of brain activity and structure with high
temporal and spatial resolution. We will also develop MEG and MRI algorithms for data acquisition/analysis and
high accuracy biomagnetic source localization."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has remained a considerable clinical challenge due to the
lack of efficacious genetic targets. We need unique effective therapies and accurate biomarkers
that can be used to predict patient responses in TNBC. We find that the ARF tumor suppressor
is lost alongside p53 mutation in 60% of TNBC. Potentially stemming from the dual loss of ARF
and p53, we have observed that type I IFN signaling is elevated in TNBC. We show that this IFN
production is being kept in check by the ADAR1 enzyme. Notably, we discovered that ADAR1 is
a novel binding partner for ARF. The central premise of this proposal is that the novel ARF-ADAR1
interaction provides key insights into how these two proteins function in the etiology of TNBC. The
research application focuses on the role of this interaction in regulating the type I interferon
response and sensitizing TNBC cells to cell death and immune recognition. The overarching
hypothesis of the proposed research is that loss of ARF and p53 results in elevated type I IFN
signaling and sensitizes cells to ADAR1 depletion.
In Aim 1, we will define the functional interaction of ARF and ADAR1. In the absence of functional
p53, ARF protein expression is induced. In this setting, we find that ARF can fully titrate all the
cellular ADAR1 into ARF complexes. We will test the hypothesis that ARF mechanistically traps
ADAR1 in the nucleolus to prevent ADAR1 from repressing the type I interferon pathway. In Aim
2, we present data that TNBC cells are sensitive to ADAR1 depletion. Importantly, this sensitivity
is dependent on type I interferon signaling. We will test the hypothesis that activation of IFN
production and signaling will combine with ADAR1 depletion to produce synthetic lethality in vitro
and in vivo. We will utilize both agonists of the IFN pathway and synthetic ARF peptide mimics.
In Aim 3, we will assess how the ARF-ADAR1 interaction influences the tumor microenvironment.
While type I IFN release is a major component of the anti-viral response, chronic IFN- release
by tumor cells can both alter the local immune environment and expression of PD-L1 on tumor
cells. We will test the hypothesis that hyperactivation of the type I IFN pathway by ADAR depletion
will result in gains in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and elicit an anti-tumor immune response that
will prevent metastasis. These studies are paramount to informing new approaches in treating
TNBC through activation of IFN signaling in the tumor microenvironment."

The National Dementia Workforce Study (NDWS) will be launched by a national team of experts in clinical care
of persons living with dementia, survey research, and health workforce research. The goal of the NDWS data
infrastructure is to allow researchers and policymakers to ask and answer scientific questions to help build the
workforce of clinicians and other professional care providers required by the growing population of persons
living with dementia in the U.S. The Administrative Data Transfer, Masking, Access, and Ethics Core will
oversee linking of the NDWS survey data with other sources of administrative and secondary data in
combinations that can maximize scientific insights while still preserving respondent and facility privacy.
Specifically, the Administrative Data Transfer, Masking, Access, and Ethics Core will: 1) Use Medicare,
Medicaid, and assessment data to derive process and quality outcomes to characterize care delivery to PLWD
for the clinicians, facilities, and agencies in each survey of the NDWS; 2) Prepare administrative and other
secondary information sources in data sets that can be linked with NDWS respondent survey data to gain
further insights into factors that influence the workforce as well as PLWD care outcomes; 3) Establish
guidelines for restricted data access to safeguard respondent privacy."
10778201,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
The administrative core of this program is integrated into the Gene and Cell Therapy Program within the Wells
Center for Pediatric Research at Indiana University. It provides the mechanism for pre- and post-award
administration of the program, for regular and effective interactions of the investigators who constitute the key
personnel of the projects and cores, and for assembling the Internal and External Advisory Committee to provide
ongoing peer review and input to all programmatic initiatives. The administrative core interacts at all levels with
the central administration of Indiana University School of Medicine and the Wells Center for Pediatric Research.
The Administrative core will foster reproducibility and rigor in scientific progress through provision of statistical
support, organization of data collection and access, exchange and coordination of scientific progress, and
inclusion of trainees and mentees in web conferences, meetings, and symposia. The Core will provide budgetary
oversight over the program and also coordinate and maintain documentation of institutional regulatory approvals,
arrange for the resolution of potential conflicts, facilitate electronic file sharing for administrative and scientific
purposes and for preparation of publications, as well as sharing of reagents, protocols, and experimental models
within the program and with others in the scientific community. Further the Core will facilitate integration of
trainees and mentees and help enrich their training experience through inclusion in scientific activities and
discussions, a seminar series, and an annual symposium."
10778202,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Gene therapy for hemophilia A holds promise to accomplish a lasting cure. Adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene
transfer of clotting factor FVIII to the livers of males can achieve therapeutic correction but this is not sustained.
The reasons for hepatotoxicity and the decline in FVIII expression in clinical trials are unclear. The AAV therapies
currently under investigation target hepatocytes in the liver. There is, however, a limited understanding of the
interactions between the vector and hepatocytes as well as effect of FVIII expression and immune responses.
Core B will provide primary human hepatocyte models to address these basic and mechanistic questions related
to the biology of AAV and FVIII. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that multiple interconnected features
of AAV and FVIII biology limit durability of therapeutic expression and pose serious safety concerns. The
objectives of Core B, the Human Hepatocyte and Discovery Core, is to provide three primary human hepatocytes
models to study AAV vector and FVIII biology. The first model is primary hepatocyte cultures that retain stable
hepatocyte functions in 2-dimensional format. These will be used for in vitro studies. The second model is
chimeric mice whose livers are highly repopulated with primary human hepatocytes. These will be used for in
vivo AAV studies. And the third model is mice doubly engrafted with hematopoietic stem cells and livers for in
vivo studies of human immune cells in the liver. Core B will provide these services to investigators to address
major unanswered questions in FVIII biology, gene therapy for hemophilia, liver-directed gene transfer, and
molecular and immunobiology of AAV vectors."
10778205,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Deficiency of clotting factor VIII (FVIII) causes the bleeding disorder hemophilia A (HA), an X chromosome-linked
bleeding defect affecting 1/5,000 males world-wide. Although bleeding episodes are prevented by prophylactic
administration of FVIII preparations or novel molecules that bypass FVIII, there is no effective long-term cure.
Gene therapy through adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated ectopic FVIII expression in hepatocytes has
emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for HA, but has met with two hurdles: 1) A requirement for very
high vector doses to drive FVIII expression in hepatocytes; and 2) Declining therapeutic transgene expression
over time accompanied with transient liver damage after vector injection, both of which may be directly linked to
the fact that FVIII is prone to misfolding, aggregation and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We
demonstrated that increased FVIII synthesis does not equate to increased FVIII secretion. Since isolation of the
FVIII gene in 1984, we have discovered many detrimental cellular responses as a consequence of heterologous
expression of wildtype FVIII or B-domain deleted FVIII (BDD), presently the FVIII derivative in clinical gene
therapy studies for HA. These responses include: 1) Formation toxic aggregates in the ER; 2) Hepatosteatosis;
3) Activation of an innate inflammatory response; 4) Activation of the ER unfolded protein response that leads to
cell death; 5) Production of detrimental reactive oxygen species; and 6) Potential development of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). Moreover, we and the Xiao lab (Project 2) discovered two BDD variants that efficiently fold
and are secreted from the cell. “F309S” BDD-FVIII has a single amino acid change at Phe309 to Ser so it does
not aggregate in the ER. Another BDD-FVIII variant “X5”, which exchanges 5 amino acids in human BDD for
corresponding porcine residues, is also secreted more efficiently than wildtype BDD-FVIII. We hypothesize that:
a. FVIII expressed in hepatocytes by AAV delivery forms aggregates in the ER and activates stress responses
resulting in cell death and potential HCC; and b. Novel FVIII molecules that more efficiently fold and are secreted
will exhibit less toxicity in vivo are improved options for HA gene therapy. These hypotheses will be tested in 3
aims: 1. Delineate the cellular responses induced by AAV-BDD expression in hepatocytes of mice and define
their pathophysiological consequences, especially HCC development; 2. Fully evaluate the potential of BDD
variants F309S and X5 as more efficacious, safe and durable options for HA gene therapy; and 3. Characterize
innate responses upon FVIII expression in primary human hepatocytes in humanized mice (Core 2). Our in-
depth understanding of these issues should encourage the design of more optimal AAV-BDD vectors for HA
gene therapy (Project 2) and increase our understanding of the impact of cellular stress and systemic
inflammatory responses associated with AAV-BDD transduction in vivo (Project 3). Completion of this project
will likely provide essential information required for development of a safe and durable long-term cure for HA."

The molecular evolution underlying cell type diversity and function has facilitated the increased cognitive capacity
of humans. While significant progress has been made to uncover cell type specific gene expression programs
in the brains of rodents, only a modest amount of progress has been made in human brains. Moreover, the
majority of the existing cell type genomic datasets focus on gray matter. Our recent work has identified important
human-specific gene expression patterns relevant to non-neurons, especially oligodendrocytes. Human brain
imaging studies in disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia have identified alterations in
white matter tracts that are primarily comprised of oligodendrocytes. We therefore propose to profile white matter
tracts that are anatomically comparable across primates: pyramidal tract, optic chiasm, cerebellar white matter,
and corpus callosum. Because oligodendrocyte maturation varies between gray and white matter, we will profile
tissue across development. This comparative cell type profiling between human and non-human primate brain
will provide spatially defined epigenomic and transcriptomic data through the following four Aims: 1) Profile single
cell level transcriptional maps and chromatin states of white matter tracts and functionally associated gray matter
in human brain across development; 2) Profile single cell level transcriptional maps and chromatin states of white
matter tracts and functionally associated gray matter across development in two non-human primates: rhesus
macaque and the common marmoset; 3) Profile single cell level transcriptional maps and chromatin states of
white matter tracts and functionally associated gray matter in additional tissue from adult great ape and monkey
brains; and 4) Validate observed differences in white matter composition at the cell type level in human and non-
human primates. Together, these aims will molecularly define understudied cell types from human and non-
human primate brains."

Nuclear RNAi is an evolutionarily conserved epigenetic silencing pathway that targets transposons and other
foreign DNA. The defining features of this pathway are small RNA-guided chromatin modifications and
transcriptional repression at a target gene. In C. elegans, nuclear RNAi is essential for genome stability and
promotes germline immortality. Nuclear RNAi can be conveniently triggered by feeding worms with dsRNA,
which leads to heritable silencing at the target gene for multiple generations. These features, together with
powerful genetics and genomic tools and a three-day reproductive cycle, make C. elegans a highly tractable
system to study transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) in animals. Project 1. Investigating the
biochemistry and cellular function of a novel histone modification H3K23me3. The broad and long-term
objectives of this project are to comprehensively identify and characterize the histone post-translational
modifications and corresponding chromatin enzymes in the context of TEI. In the proposed funding cycle, this
application will investigate the function and enzymology of a novel histone modification H3K23me3, which can
be induced by nuclear RNAi. H3K23me3 is an understudied heterochromatin mark even though it is conserved
from plants to mammals. This application will take combined genetic, genomic, and biochemical approaches to
(1) determine the functional relationship between three key heterochromatin marks: H3K9me3, H3K23me3,
and H3K27me3, (2) understand why the nuclear RNAi pathway is required for C. elegans germline immortality
under heat stress, and (3) identify additional H3K23 histone methyltransferases in C. elegans. The results will
advance the histone code theory and provide mechanistic insight into nuclear RNAi and TEI. Project 2.
Investigating how C. elegans germline distinguishes self and nonself siRNAs. The broad and long-term
objectives of this project are to dissect the diverse functions of small RNAs in C. elegans and understand how
cells distinguish self and foreign genetic material. As a short-term goal, this project will investigate a newly
identified genetic activity termed “siRNA suppression”, which enables C. elegans to distinguish siRNAs that
target self-genes from ones that target nonself DNA such transposons. Both classes of siRNAs play important
but different functions in animal development. This project will identify the protein factors, subcellular location,
and molecular rules of siRNA suppression. As an overall significance, this application will identify new
components in chromatin and small RNA, both of which are fundamental to our understanding of
transgenerational epigenetics and long-term environmental impacts on human health."

 The goal of this FOA is “to improve our understanding of how vaccines against infectious agents
lead to durable protective immunity.” This project seeks to address this objective through a detailed
characterization of immune responses in the early phase post-vaccination to identify components that
distinguish durable from non-durable responses to vaccination with a live attenuated vaccine against
dengue virus (DENV). To date, a single dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) has reached licensure and others
have shown promising efficacy data, but there remain important gaps in the safety and efficacy of these
vaccines, particularly around the issue of the durability of protective immunity. This project leverages
blood samples available from dengue vaccine trials, in particular a longitudinal study of participants from
a phase III trial of CYD-TDV that has been ongoing since 2011. The project addresses the overall
hypothesis that functional, transcriptomic, and epigenetic profiles of DENV-specific T and B lymphocytes
early post-vaccination predict the establishment of long-lasting DENV-specific serologic immunity
through the following Specific Aims: 1) Identify T and B cell functional responses to DENV associated
with the long-term persistence of binding and neutralizing antibodies after receipt of CYD-TDV; 2) Identify
gene expression and epigenetic profile(s) in DENV-specific T and B lymphocytes associated with the
persistence of antibodies after receipt of CYD-TDV; and 3) Validate the immunological signature of
durable antibody responses in recipients of CYD-TDV and compare this signature to other dengue
vaccines and to natural and experimental DENV infection."

Protein-DNA interactions are crucial for life. Dysfunction of DNA-binding proteins often causes human
diseases because these proteins are vital for cells to regulate gene expression and to maintain genomic
integrity. Therefore, a deep understanding of protein-DNA interactions is biomedically important. In the
past decades, knowledge about three-dimensional structures of protein-DNA complexes has
tremendously increased, largely due to methodological advances in structural biology. However,
structure information alone is not sufficient to truly understand protein-DNA interactions because they are
inherently dynamic. The overall objective in this project is to deepen our understanding of dynamic
aspects of molecular processes whereby DNA-binding proteins scan DNA and recognize their targets.
Using unique and powerful nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods along with various other
biophysical methods, the research team of this project will investigate the dynamics of protein-DNA
interactions at molecular, sub-molecular, and atomic levels. At a molecular level, the research team will
examine how DNA-binding proteins overcome traps and obstacles that impede the search process
whereby the proteins find targets on DNA. The dynamics involving intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs)
and transient microscopic dissociation/re-association will be investigated using NMR and stopped-flow
fluorescence methods. At a sub-molecular level, the research team will study the mechanisms whereby
IDRs exert strong influences on DNA-binding proteins. Recently, the research team has developed a
unique NMR method to directly determine local electrostatic potentials for each residue of biomolecules
without any use of structural information. The research team will take full advantage of this method in
conjunction with other methods and investigate dynamic long-range communications between IDRs and
the DNA-binding domains as well as the electrostatic impacts of post-translational modifications in IDRs.
At an atomic level, the research team will investigate the dynamic behavior of various counterions around
DNA and proteins using special hardware for diffusion NMR spectroscopy. This information is important
because the release of counterions makes a major entropic contribution to the binding free energy for
protein-DNA association. This project will illuminate the dynamic aspects of protein-DNA interactions and
will help develop therapeutic strategies for human diseases caused by dysfunction of DNA-binding
proteins."

tissues. Thus, we devised the first long-read approach for thousands of single cells (Single-cell isoform RNA
sequencing, ScISOr-Seq, Gupta, …, Tilgner, Nat Biotechnol’18). We then devised novel statistical isoform-
testing and the first spatially defined long-read sequencing approach (Slide-isoform sequencing, Sl-ISO-Seq,
Joglekar, …, Tilgner, Nat Comms’21 – funded by NIGMS). We complemented this R package with a
visualization tool for single-cell isoform expression (ScISOr-Wiz, Stein, …, Tilgner, Bioinformatics’22 – funded
by NIGMS). Most recently, we are applying ScISOr-Seq across five adult mouse brain regions and three
developmental time points to define the developmental timelines leading to brain-region specific splicing
(Joglekar, …, Tilgner, to be submitted to Nature by March – in smaller parts funded by NIGMS). We devised
methods to remove intronic cDNAs and artifactual non-barcoded cDNAs introduced by 10xGenomics, enabling
single-cell splicing research in frozen tissues (Single-nuclei isoform RNA sequencing, SnISOr-Seq, Hardwick,
…, Tilgner, Nat Biotechnol’22 – funded by NIGMS). We recently enhanced our SnISOr-Seq to define
dysregulation of AS in neurons and glia from frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases. We show that the strongest
FTD-associated splicing events occur in restricted cell subtypes and that ~20% of these events detected in a
cell type cannot be observed in all cells jointly (Belchikov, …, Tilgner, in review – funded by NIGMS).
 Separately, we defined error sources in long-read data. Specifically, we used barcoding technologies to
sequence two cDNA representations of the same RNA molecule on both Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and
Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). We found highly specific error patterns (Mikheenko, …, Tilgner,
Genome Research’22 – funded by NIGMS). Using the knowledge on such error patterns, we then created
accurate isoform detection software (Prjibelski, …, Tilgner, Nat Biotechnol’23).
 We have described the field in reviews on long-read sequencing (Hardwick, …, Tilgner, Frontiers
Genetics’19) and single-cell isoform research (Joglekar, …, Tilgner, in review – funded by NIGMS). Upon
invitation by Nature Methods, in honor of their naming of long-read sequencing as the method of the year 2022,
we detailed advances and future directions (Foord, …, Tilgner, Nature Methods, in press – funded by NIGMS).
 Over the next 5 years, my lab will advance what is measurable in single-nuclei and spatial experiments.
For example, we will define TSS at single-nucleotide, single-cell and single-molecule resolution using long reads.
Moreover, we will measure DNA methylation, open chromatin, gene expression and splicing in individual cells to
decipher how these layers influence each other in health and disease. More generally, we will advance what can
be measured in single-cell and spatial biology, including but not limited to spliceosomal RNAs, miRNAs and
protein-protein interactions that are governed by alternative splicing."

The sense of movement (kinesthesia) provides an interoceptive internal readout of our physical actions in space
and is essential for our ability to move fluidly and effectively through our environment. Despite kinesthesia's
importance in motor function and self-reference, our understanding of this sense is plagued by glaring knowledge
gaps and inconsistencies. Movement sensations are traditionally believed to be a specialized function of type Ia
muscle spindle afferents. Yet, the apparent disconnect between the peripheral coding properties of this receptor
and the sensory stimuli known to evoke a sense of movement have raised questions regarding their primary role
in kinesthesia. Although proprioceptive interventions provide functional motor improvements for many conditions
such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, focal dystonia, peripheral neuropathies, and musculoskeletal injuries, the
lack of a clear scientific foundation for kinesthesia impacts our understanding of sensory-motor deficits and
prevents important breakthroughs from translating into clinical successes and targeted intervention strategies.
From our recent work we have multiple lines of evidence that suggest there may be sensory muscle receptors,
outside of the traditional muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs that exhibit features consistent with a
kinesthetic sensor. First, our peripheral electrophysiological recordings in rat demonstrate a population of fast-
conducting rapidly-adapting afferents, that are distinct from muscle spindle and Golgi tendon organ afferents,
yet are selectively activated in the frequency bandwidth associated with kinesthetic illusions. Second, our
immunological analyses in mouse skeletal muscle reveal a new population of large caliber Calbindin28k+
afferents that do not associate with muscle spindle or Golgi tendon organ receptors but instead terminate in free
endings that spread out alongside extrafusal muscle fibers. In a movement-perception study with human neural-
machine interface amputees, we found that vibration-induce illusory kinesthetic percepts were linked to muscle
contraction not elongation. These results were corroborated in a human stroke model where we amplified
kinesthetic perception linked to active muscle contraction which resulted in improved reaching trajectories. With
these observations we hypothesize that there are candidate muscle sensory afferents, distinct from type Ia
afferents, which selectively respond to muscle fiber contraction.
The studies in this proposal will explore the relationships between the response properties and physical
characteristics of these candidate kinesthetic receptors and the traditionally defined muscle sensory receptors
using genetic, histological, and electrophysiological approaches. Additionally, we will examine this systems
functionality with respect to contractile features and its ability to serve as a stimulus for active movement sensing.
The discovery and evaluation of the cellular basis of kinesthesia will fundamentally transform our understanding
of sensory-motor control and, by extension, will impact design strategies for advanced neural-machine interface
prosthetic devices for amputees, as well as other disorders with sensory-motor deficiencies such as stroke."

The health of animals often depends on their ability to form symbioses with bacteria that are acquired from
environmental reservoirs. Bacteria that express specific traits that increase host fitness, and in many cases,
hosts that lack these beneficial symbionts are at increased risk for developing disease. As part of our long-
term goal to understand how these symbioses are established and maintained, this proposal will investigate
several factors that impact the ability of the beneficial symbiont Vibrio fischeri to colonize and be maintained by
its natural host the Hawaiian bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes. The focus will be on three areas: 1)
interference competition among beneficial symbionts, 2) the role of sulfur metabolism in symbiont physiology,
and 3) evolution of signaling systems in bacterial symbionts. Progress in understanding these areas will
provide new insights into the mechanisms enabling bacterial symbionts to colonize and be maintained by their
hosts. The findings associated with this project may contribute to the strategies employed to improve host
health by manipulating beneficial symbionts."

 One third of eukaryotic proteins transit the secretory pathway for sorting to specific locations, including
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, plasma membrane or extracellular milieu. Since misdirected proteins
cannot function, the secretory pathway is critical for establishing and maintaining normal cell and tissue
physiology. The COPII coat protein complex, which mediates anterograde trafficking from the ER, is a key control
point for protein targeting. Indeed, mutations in COPII genes cause a range of human diseases, including cranio-
lenticulo-sutural dysplasia (CLSD), a subtype of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), hematologic disorders and myriad
neurological defects. Detailed knowledge of COPII trafficking is required to understand its role in cell physiology
and to treat disorders in which it is disrupted. However, while the core COPII machinery is well defined, little is
known about how vertebrate cells regulate COPII activity in response to normal or pathological signals or stress.
 We and others have found that several COPII proteins are modified by O-linked b-N-acetylglucosamine
(O-GlcNAc), a dynamic form of intracellular protein glycosylation. At the start of the prior project period, the
effects of O-GlcNAcylation on COPII remained almost entirely unknown. Since then, we have defined the scope
of O-GlcNAcylation in the core COPII system, identified functional effects of O-GlcNAc cycling in vesicle
trafficking, devised new quantitative glycoproteomics methods to profile O-GlcNAc changes in response to
secretory pathway stress and other stimuli, and demonstrated that particular Sec23A O-GlcNAc sites are
required for endogenous collagen trafficking in cultured human cells and in the chondrocytes of developing
zebrafish. Together, these results demonstrate that site-specific O-GlcNAcylation of COPII proteins governs
cargo trafficking in vertebrate cells and tissues. However, major unanswered questions remain, including the
mechanistic effects that O-GlcNAc exerts on COPII proteins, the upstream stimuli that modulate COPII O-
GlcNAcylation and the global landscape of O-GlcNAc signaling in the early secretory pathway. Here, we propose
to address these important questions in the next award period.
 In Aim 1, we will dissect the molecular mechanisms by which O-GlcNAc cycling influences COPII vesicle
trafficking. In Aim 2, we will identify upstream stimuli that control COPII protein O-GlcNAcylation and determine
the downstream effects of this signaling in protein secretion and cell cycle progression. In Aim 3, we will use our
glycoproteomics methods to canvass proteome-wide O-GlcNAc signaling in response to COPII cargo trafficking,
and provide an integrated picture of crosstalk between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation in protein secretion.
Our work will shed new light on how O-GlcNAc regulates trafficking in cells and tissues, and may reveal new
opportunities to treat diseases of COPII dysfunction by manipulating protein glycosylation."

 Children with poor early language skills are at risk for academic, social, vocational, and health challenges
across the lifespan (Botting & Conti-Ramsden, 2008; Conti-Ramsden, Durkin, Toseeb, Botting, & Pickles,
2017; Norbury & Sonuga-Barke, 2017; Pace, Alper, Burchinal, Golinkoff, & Hirsh-Pasek, 2019). This at-risk
group includes approximately 1.6 million children under five with primary developmental language disorder
(DLD) and 300,500 children with DLD and an autism spectrum disorder (ASD+DLD; Bishop, 2010; Norbury &
Sonuga-Barke, 2017; U.S. Census Bureau, 2017b; Xu, Strathearn, Liu, & Bao, 2018). Parent-implemented
early language intervention is a cost-effective option to address this public health issue. However, these
interventions yield large individual differences in outcomes and limited scalability (Roberts & Kaiser, 2011).
Variable intervention effectiveness could result from many factors including parent-level differences in
language skills and behavioral awareness. Despite differences in interaction quality across parents (Hirsh-
Pasek et al., 2015), and potential heritable components of language disorder (Bishop, 2009), there has been
little to no exploration of the role of these parent-level factors in early language interaction and intervention.
 This project will address this critical gap in the evidence. Parents' language skills will be examined in
relationship to the quality of parent–child language interactions (Aim1). Furthermore, this research will explore
whether parents' behavioral awareness predicts their modifiability after brief training (Aim 2). Finally, predictors
of early language interaction quality and modifiability will be compared in dyads with typically developing
children, children with primary DLD, and with ASD+DLD (Aim 3). The long-term goal of this research program
is to increase intervention effectiveness and improve child outcomes by extending the social-interactionist
framework to scaffold parents. Differences between the DLD and ASD+DLD groups could inform disorder-
specific intervention recommendations. Behavioral data will be collected from three groups of parent-child
dyads—children with primary DLD (Aim 1,2,&3), children with ASD+DLD (Aim 3), and age-matched controls
(Aim 1,2,&3). Inter- and intra-group analyses will be conducted to explore the relationships between parent-
level factors, the quality of parent–child interaction, and parent modifiability following parent training.
 These aims will support the long-term career development goal of improving the language, academic, and
health outcomes of at-risk children through family-centered early language intervention research. Three
specific areas of career development have also been identified: 1) examining individual-level factors that
impact early language interaction and intervention outcomes, 2) applying family-centered intervention to
specific disorder groups, and 3) analyzing multi-level and longitudinal data. The career development will take
place at an R1 university with support from an accomplished, inter-disciplinary mentorship team."

Current NIAAA strategic plan calls for efforts to identify novel molecular actions of alcohol and new remedies to
mitigate alcohol-impacted brain regions. Ever-changing research tools have exponentially accelerated our
understanding of brain regions and circuits affected by alcohol use and comorbid affective disorders. However,
efforts towards the understanding of molecular mechanisms for altered neural activity in these impacted
regions have lagged behind. To fill in this gap, we will explore a previously unknown molecular mechanism
whereby ethanol modulation of brain cholesterol in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) leads to aberrant mGluR2
function and glutamate transmission in a rodent model of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure. This
modulation may thus contribute to alcohol drinking and anxiety-like behavior, commonly observed in patients
with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Using a CIE rodent model, we show that CIE increases glutamate release in
the PFC along with increased alcohol drinking and anxiety-like behavior. Further, we and others report that
ablation of PFC neuron projection to subcortical regions (e.g. BLA or NAc) abolishes these behaviors. Thus,
the PFC is a critical hub for regulating dependence-related neural and behavioral activity. However, the
molecular mechanisms underlying CIE-induced disruption of glutamate transmission in the PFC remain
elusive. Our preliminary data strongly suggest mGluR2 involvement in this region: a) CIE spatially segregates
mGluR2 from Gαo subunit and reduces mGluR2 stimulation of Gαi/o; b) CIE abolishes mGluR2 inhibition of
Gβγ-mediated presynaptic glutamate release and postsynaptic intrinsic excitability of PFC neurons; and c) CIE
impairs mGluR2 inhibition of anxiety-like behavior. Such a deficit in mGluR2 function may be governed by
membrane cholesterol. We found that CIE drastically increases cholesterol content in the PFC by enhancing
the activity of HMG-CoA-reductase (HMGCR), a cholesterol synthesis enzyme. Importantly, reduced, CIE-
dependent mGluR2 function can be reversed by ex vivo cholesterol removal and mimicked by ex vivo
cholesterol addition to naïve tissue. We hypothesize that blockade of cholesterol increase will attenuate CIE-
dependent disruption of mGluR2-mediated G-protein activation, neurophysiology and dependence-related
behaviors. We will use CRISPR/Cas9, cellular, electrophysiological and behavioral approaches to test our
hypothesis. The proposal is conceptually and technically innovative and significant, investigating a largely
overlooked and potentially impactful effect of CIE exposure on cholesterol modulation of mGluR2 function,
glutamate transmission and anxiety-like behavior."

 The Colorado Learning Disabilities Research Center (CLDRC) is a long-standing interdisciplinary, multisite
research program that investigates the genetic and environmental etiologies, neurobiology, neuropsychology,
classification, and outcomes of specific learning disabilities (SLDs) and related disorders such as
attention/deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The unifying themes of this proposal for renewal of the
Colorado Learning Disabilities Research Center are (1) to continue to produce innovative and impactful basic
science to understand the shared risk factors that explain why specific learning disabilities (SLDs) are so often
comorbid with other SLDs and disorders such as ADHD and anxiety, and just as importantly to identify the
specific factors which contribute uniquely to each SLD; (2) to explicitly integrate cutting-edge research with
state-of-the-art clinical training, facilitating the development of project-based career-enhancing opportunities for
CLDRC mentees, (3) to expand bidirectional engagement efforts with the community to remove barriers that
prevent equitable access to services, maximizing the impact of our Center for all individuals with SLDs and
their families, and (4) to disseminate the results of the CLDRC effectively to all stakeholders, including families,
practitioners, educators, other scientists, and policy communities.
 In addition to our ongoing efforts to publish our results for the scientific community, the CLDRC continues
to expand our efforts to translate and disseminate results from the CLDRC to a broader audiences of
practitioners, educators, and individuals with learning disabilities. The CLDRC infrastructure also provides an
unprecedented opportunity for interdisciplinary mentorship and project-embedded career enhancement
opportunities for the next generation of LD investigators. The Engagement Core describes the specific
strategies we will use to continue to support and expand these opportunities, including specific strategies to
enhance the recruitment and retention of mentees from groups that are underrepresented in research careers.
In addition, one of our most important objectives over the next five years is to expand our bidirectional
engagement efforts by integrating community members in contributing roles on all projects.
 The most distal long-term research objective of the CLDRC is the development of a comprehensive model
of LDs that is based on a complete understanding of LDs at the genetic, environmental, neurobiological,
cognitive, behavioral, and instructional levels of analysis. This is a daunting challenge that cannot be
accomplished by a single scientist or research lab working in isolation. Instead, this work will require the
successful integration of diverse approaches and strategies. The ongoing and long-term objective of the
CLDRC is to continue provide a place where this synergistic integration can occur to promote interdisciplinary
LD research and to develop the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists and practitioners."

Buprenorphine has been proven as an important therapy in helping patients overcome opioid addition and in preventing
overdose. Past usage of BUP has been shown to be both extremely safe and effective. Unfortunately, one of the
major problems with all medication assisted treatment is noncompliance. To combat this issue, additional longer acting
biodegradable systems must be develop to deliver BUP for longer durations than currently available. With the basis of
this program supporting the discovery and development of medications to prevent and treat opioid use disorders and
overdose, rapid advancement towards a viable product for new dose regimens and ease of administration for increased
adherence should be one of the first, scientifically sound, and robust choices moving forward.
PLGA-based drug delivery systems have been used successfully in a number of small molecule products and are the
most widely utilized and studied biocompatible polymer systems in controlled release to date. Therefore, the
regulatory and development hurdles with the FDA will be ‘lower’ than with other novel excipients or technologies.
The goal of this research and product development plan is to perform a pilot pharmacokinetic clinical trial in healthy
volunteers. Our preliminary data indicates a biodegradable rod formulation can be fabricated with release profiles
similar to that of Probuphine®, and will be optimized over the duration of this project.
The Specific Aim of this project is to develop and optimize a biodegradable BUP rod formulation that provides
therapeutic kinetics for ≥3 months. The Milestones for the UG3 phase are: (i) Illustrate the critical process parameters
and material attributes that dictate the in vitro release kinetics of a ≥3-month; (ii) Successful demonstration of ≥3-month
in vivo pharmacokinetics in the dog model from a single biodegradable BUP rod (iii) Confirmation of regulatory
requirement and pathway through a preIND meeting with the FDA; and for the UH3 phase are: (iv) Successfully transfer
the formulation and manufacturing of the ≥3-month candidate formulation a demonstrated through in vivo studies in the
dog model, (v) Completion of GLP local tolerance study (if required by FDA), (vi) IND submission and clearance from
the FDA, and (vii) Demonstrate ≥3-month pharmacokinetics above the Cmin and below the Cmax in healthy volunteers.
The innovation in this technology is the ability to control the BUP release kinetics in a biodegradable format while
minimizing the initial burst; based on our mechanistic understanding of the PLGA microparticle formation process,
using PLGAs with specific molecular properties, and providing tight control over the manufacturing conditions.
Utilizing extrusion, biodegradable polymer, and compression will enable readily technical transferability as these
processes are already heavily utilized in the pharmaceutical industry, allowing for a seamless transition from academia to
industry. Furthermore, extrusion-based processes are already scaled in that it is a continuous process, and PLGA-based
formulations have previously have been shown to be safe based on the approximate 20 FDA approved products currently
on the market. The significance of this research and product development is the final outcome of this project will
ultimately provide a new, readily viable, essential tool to help patients overcome opioid use disorder."
10757900,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Most children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) also have below-age vocabulary knowledge. These deficits are linked to their poor social communication skills. Vocabulary knowledge in the preschool years is a powerful predictor of outcomes. It is therefore crucial to understand how preschoolers with ASD can acquire new vocabulary. In the current proposal, we study how preschoolers with ASD and typically-developing (TD) children learn vocabulary in situations that place minimal demands on social communication skills to see if these can provide an alternate avenue for vocabulary instruction.

Specifically, we study whether children can learn new words in overhearing contexts in which they are not directly addressed, but instead are witnesses to a conversation between two adults, one of whom introduces a new word to the other. Prior work has shown that TD children can learn new words in such situations, and there is preliminary evidence from the PI’s; work that children with ASD can as well. We also examine whether children can learn from these interactions when they take place on video, and whether they can acquire verbs and pronouns as well as nouns from these interactions.

This research will shed light on the mechanisms underlying language learning in ASD and in TD and will support the development of effective language interventions."
10759404,"The conditioning of ethanol’s (EtOH) reinforcing effects with environmental stimuli is a major factor in the abuse
potential of this drug. EtOH-related stimuli elicit strong EtOH seeking in animal models of relapse and these
models are widely employed to study the neurobiological basis of EtOH craving and relapse. However,
behavioral and neurobiological information on conditioning factors in EtOH seeking derived from animal models
is limited to that from EtOH nondependent animals or, in animals with a dependence history, use of stimuli
conditioned to the reinforcing effects of EtOH before dependence induction without consideration of conditioning
factors related specifically to EtOH consumption in the dependent state. In alcoholics, a significant positive
correlation exists between the history and degree of dependence and the severity of drinking urges induced by
alcohol-related environmental stimuli. One process to explain this observation is that repeated consumption of
EtOH during withdrawal states allows for learning of the negative contingency between EtOH consumption and
adverse withdrawal symptoms, modifying an individual’s reinforcement history to include learning about
amelioration/avoidance of adverse states as a novel and essential aspect of EtOH’s reinforcing actions. This
proposal is designed to address the implications of this process with regard to EtOH craving and relapse, with
the major hypothesis that a consequence of withdrawal-related learning (WDL) the conditioned effects of EtOH-
associated environmental stimuli come to exert more powerful control over EtOH-directed behavior than stimuli
conditioned to the positive reinforcing effects alone, and thereby play a dominant role in eliciting and maintaining
compulsive EtOH seeking. In support of this hypothesis, preliminary data that provide the basis for this proposal
show that stimuli conditioned to EtOH availability during withdrawal (WDL) elicit significant reinstatement in a
manner that is punishment- and effort- resistant, whereas EtOH seeking induced by stimuli conditioned to EtOH
in the nondependent state in rats without a withdrawal-related learning (N-WDL) history is not. The purpose of
the proposed project is to solidify and extend the preliminary findings across three Specific Aims: (1) to establish
the significance of environmental conditioning to withdrawal relief by EtOH (WDL) in initiating and maintaining
compulsive EtOH seeking, (2) to identify neuronal ensembles mediating compulsive ethanol seeking linked to
WDL and to confirm their role in this behavior via activity-dependent pharmacogenetic neural inactivation, and
(3) to establish the neurochemical/phenotypic profile of behaviorally critical neuronal ensembles in WDL- vs. N-
WDL-motivated EtOH seeking utilizing RNAscope®. Successful completion of this project is expected to
establish WDL as a major previously not well recognized factor in relapse vulnerability and provide the necessary
foundations for future studies to uncover the learning and neuroadaptive and mechanisms responsible for the
control of EtOH seeking by stimuli linked to WDL."
10759413,"Caregiver Speaks: A Technologically Mediated Storytelling Intervention for Family Caregivers of
 Individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease and Other Dementias
ABSTRACT
This randomized controlled trial will test an intervention for an understudied population – family caregivers of
persons living with dementia (PLWD). This project is the first of its kind to longitudinally follow family caregivers
of PLWD into bereavement. Furthermore, the intervention, Caregiver Speaks, employs an innovative
storytelling approach – photo elicitation (the use of photos to elicit thoughts, feelings, and reactions to a
person’s experience) – to encourage family caregivers to make meaning of their caregiving and bereavement
experiences as a way of reducing depression, anxiety, and ultimately grief intensity. Caregiver Speaks is
deployed via a readily available social media network (Facebook), which allows easy access for already
overburdened family caregivers of PLWD, and can improve their social support. Preliminary work
demonstrates that 1) this project is feasible as an RCT intervention study of caregiver experiences, 2) the
research team can conduct this type of storytelling intervention via Facebook, and 3) family caregivers use
(and want to use) social media during active caregiving and into bereavement, despite their heavy care
burdens. The research team will base the proposal on Park and Folkman’s meaning-making model of stress
and coping. This model illustrates how individuals cope with adverse life events (i.e., trauma, or death of a
loved one) by reconstructing and transforming the event’s meaning and incorporating the reappraised meaning
into one’s larger self-narrative. Caregiver Speaks uses storytelling in the form of photo-elicitation, in order to
facilitate this meaning-making. Caregivers share photos and discussions regarding their caregiving and
bereavement experiences in a private, facilitated Facebook group. This model suggests that caregivers’ ability
to make sense of (meaning making), and find benefit in an adverse life situation (caregiving and bereavement)
will be validated through social support, and result in reduced depression, anxiety, and grief intensity.
Caregivers will be randomly assigned to either: 1) Group 1, which will receive the Caregiver Speaks
intervention, or 2) Group 2, which will receive standard care, including the standard care for bereavement. The
research team will use both quantitative and qualitative methods in parallel and equal status to measure the
intervention’s efficacy. The overall hypothesis is that participating in Caregiver Speaks during caregiving and
into bereavement will reduce caregivers’ depression and anxiety, and as a result will reduce grief intensity in
bereavement. The three specific aims are to: 1) determine the efficacy of the Caregiver Speaks
intervention in reducing depression and anxiety among family caregivers of people with dementia, 2)
examine the intervention’s effect on grief intensity among bereaved family caregivers of people with
dementia, and 3) describe how caregivers made meaning of their caregiving and bereavement
experiences."
10759417,"Biological clocks play a key role in how organisms adapt to daily (circadian), monthly (circalunar), and annual
(circannual) changes in the environment by regulating rhythmic fluctuations in metabolism, hormone and
neurotransmitter release, sensory capabilities and behaviors, including sleep. Disruption of circadian rhythms
(e.g. shift work, time zone changes (“jet lag”), or social jet lag), can result in significant physiological
consequences including sleep and metabolic disorders, as well as increased risk of stroke and cancer. Recent
data indicate that the circadian clock is developmentally regulated and that its time-keeping activity is
suspended in differentiating tissues to allow clock components to function in a “developmental clock”, that
regulates stem/progenitor cell biology and differentiation, among other processes. However, it is not known
how this functional shift from circadian to developmental activities is achieved, nor is it known how clock
components control normal or malignant stem/progenitor cell behaviors. The mouse mammary gland is a
powerful models system for the study of circadian rhythms, development, and stem/progenitor cell biology.
Lineage tracing studies have demonstrated that the mammary gland harbors dynamic cell populations in which
self-renewing unipotent basal and luminal stem cell lineages give rise to their respective lineages during ductal
elongation, and are responsible for breast cancer cellular heterogeneity. We have shown that PER2, a
transcription factor in the circadian clock, is differentially expressed during mammary gland development, and
is required for branching morphogenesis, suggesting a circadian clock-independent developmental role. Our
recent data using Per2-/- mouse mammary glands suggest that PER2 may play a critical role in mammary
epithelial cell lineage commitment and homeostasis, and may do so by regulating the expression of EYA2 as
well as influencing Wnt/b-catenin and TGF-b signaling. Moreover, we have found that circadian disruption in
mice results in down regulation of Per2 expression in mammary epithelial cells and increased EYA2 expression
and activation of Wnt/b-catenin. Based on these new results, we hypothesize that PER2 functions to integrate
the circadian clock with the developmental clock to control homeostasis of mammary epithelial cell types during
ductal elongation and branching morphogenesis. To address this hypothesis three Specific Aims are proposed.
Aim 1 will test circadian and circadian disruption dependent changes in stem and progenitor cells in the
developing mammary gland. Aim 2 will focus on the role of PER2 in lineage commitment using genetic reporters
to trace mammary cell differentiation and examine the effect of PER2 on stem cell homeostasis. Studies in
Aim 3 will determine PER2-dependent regulation of EYA2 gene expression and regulation of b-catenin in
mammary gland morphogenesis. Upon successful completion of this aim we will have a better understanding
of the molecular mechanisms that govern the interaction of PER2 and EYA2 as well as the effect on WNT/
TGFb signaling in branching morphogenesis."
10852934,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this project is to develop a novel therapeutic for the treatment of pemphigus.
Pemphigus involves blistering of the skin or mucosal surfaces and can lead to difficulty in
swallowing, very painful lesions, and a ~2-3 fold increased risk of mortality. About 90-95% of
pemphigus cases can be accounted for by pemphigus vulgaris (PV) or pemphigus foliaceus (PF).
Autoantibodies of the IgG class that are specific for desmogleins 1 and 3 (Dsg1 and Dsg3) disrupt
the desmosomal-mediated adhesion of keratinocytes and are the causative agents of disease.
PV can present as a mucosal-dominant form involving Dsg3-specific autoantibodies, or a form
with both Dsg1- and Dsg3-specific autoantibodies that affects skin and mucosal surfaces. PF is
a skin-dominant disease, involving only Dsg1-specific autoantibodies.
 Current treatments for pemphigus, such as the combination of corticosteroids and the B cell-
depleting antibody, rituximab, have associated adverse effects such as osteoporosis and
hypertension. In addition, the onset of action of rituximab takes several months since this
therapeutic agent targets B cells, rather than the autoantibodies themselves. The combination of
rituximab with tapered corticosteroids is also accompanied by a significant relapse rate (25-60%)
and increased infection risk due to the immunosuppressive effects of B cell depletion. Other
therapeutic approaches for pemphigus include the use of intravenous gammaglobulin,
plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption, and can lead to undesirable side effects. Consequently,
there is an unmet need to develop therapies for pemphigus that have rapid onset and high
specificity for the autoantibodies.
 This application seeks to address the need for new and improved therapies for pemphigus by
generating engineered, antibody-based reagents that specifically and rapidly deplete Dsg-specific
antibodies. Importantly, these depleting agents are highly selective and do not affect the levels of
other antibodies that have a protective role against infection. This first-in-class, novel technology
has been named Seldeg technology (for selective degradation).
 The Specific aims of the study are:
 1. To design and express Seldegs to target Dsg-specific antibodies.
 2. To analyze the stability and binding activity of the Seldegs.
 The proposed approach could be transformative for the management of pemphigus, and also
has relevance to the use of Seldeg-based strategies for multiple other clinical settings where
pathogenic antibodies cause disease."

The use of platelet transfusions has increased dramatically since 1980s, but a safe, long-term platelet storage
method remains missing. Current practice has platelets stored at 20 to 24°C after preparation, which has a
limited lifetime up to 5 days primarily due to concerns about bacterial contamination, because cold storage of
platelets results in complex molecular lesions that are recognized by host macrophages and hepatocyte
counterreceptors, leading to phagocytosis and clearance upon transfusion. In prior NIH SBIR phase 1 funded
studies, we demonstrate functionally that murine, human and Rhesus-macaque washed platelets, when stored
in refrigerated conditions for 7-14 days in the presence of a reversible RhoA GTPase inhibitor, G04, can fully
maintain function to a level like that of room-temperature stored platelets. We hypothesize that reversible
inhibition of RhoA via the G04 pharmacologic inhibitor can be translated to a new regimen for safe, cost-efficient,
and fully functional long-term storage of platelets in refrigeration. This project will develop our product, the RhoA
inhibitor S-G04, an enantiomer of G04, in a Platelet Additive Solution contained in a medically available bag, for
human platelet cold storage up to 14 days. Based on a previous discussion with the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), we aim to assess the pharmacokinetics and ADME of S-G04 in our product and to
determine the GLP stability and safety of S-G04 in FDA IND-enabling studies. The deliverables will include an
established safety and efficacy of this product in a commercially available platelet storage PAS/bag, and that
this revolutionary technology can be available to all blood centers/hospitals needing PLT transfusion as a single
inventory, like that for plasma and red blood cell supplies."
10765710,"SUMMARY: Acceleration of Circulatory and Neurological Aging due to Wildfire Exposures
Wildfires pose an increasing threat to a growing and aging global population, notably in the Western United
States. Little is known about the influence of inhaled environmental pollutants, such as from wildfire smoke
(WFS) exposure, on molecular pathways governing cerebrovascular and neurological aging in the etiology of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dementia. Yet, parallel molecular changes are induced by aging and inhaled
toxicants within the blood, raising the potential for their negative interaction. This includes increased
metalloproteinases, serpins and inflammatory factors that can directly promote age-related neurological
pathologies. Moreover, our research documents how inhaled pollutants cause blood compositional changes,
particularly as protease-induced peptides, that promote vascular dysfunction and neurological inflammation.
Inhaled toxicant induced circulating factors promote blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeation, glial activation and
pro-inflammatory secretion and recruitment, and elevation of AD markers such as amyloid beta. Inhaled
toxicant and age-related BBB deficits and associated sequelae show common involvement for vascular cell
adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), which is directly increased on cerebrovascular endothelial cells following
exposure to WFS. Thus, we hypothesize that WFS augments pathological aging outcomes of senescence-
associated secretory proteins in the circulating milieu to advance BBB compromise, neuroinflammation, and
prime AD pathogenesis principally through expression/activity of cerebrovascular VCAM-1. To test this
hypothesis, our team proposes the following aims: 1. Assess interaction between WFS exposure-induced and
aging-related circulatory changes as drivers of BBB impairment, neuroinflammation, and early evidence of
amyloid and tau proteinopathy. Serum compositional changes caused by aging x WFS exposure will be
comprehensively assessed at the protein, peptide and metabolite levels and paired with in vivo histopathology
and functional ex vivo phenotyping of major hallmarks of neurological and cardiovascular aging. 2. Delineate
the role of cerebrovascular endothelial receptors, namely CD36, as intermediates in WFS-induced
neuroinflammation. CD36 is clearly involved in acute responses of the BBB to inhaled toxicants, and likely to
upregulation of VCAM-1, which has been recently implicated as a mediator of aging-related neurological
sequelae. 3. Pharmacologically attenuate accelerated aging from WFS exposure using a sirtuin-1 activator
(resveratrol) with an NAD+ booster (NMN) and/or a senolytic cocktail to reduce aging-related circulating
factors. These permutations will target the key outcomes of circulatory changes from WFS exposure in target
cells (vascular, neural) to reduce early pro-AD pathogenic BBB compromise, neuroinflammation and
proteinopathy related outcomes. Together, findings will detail the influence of WFS in advancing age-related
AD pathogenesis by generating vascular-compromising and glial-stimulating factors in the circulation, and
evaluate counteracting therapeutics for use following unavoidable WFS exposure."
10765640,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We cloned TIM 3 as a molecule differentially expressed on IFN-g producing T cells and has emerged as a major
inhibitory molecule necessary for the termination of effector T cell responses. Tim 3 expression is increased on
effector T cells in human chronic viral infections and cancers, rendering them dysfunctional. In contrast, in human
autoimmune diseases, there is loss of Tim 3 expression on effector T cells, rendering them highly pro-
inflammatory and pathogenic. Because of its role in T cell exhaustion, Tim 3 is being targeted in multiple clinical
trials for cancer. Tim 3 is also expressed constitutively on dendritic cells (DCs), however, the role and function
of Tim 3 on DCs is not well understood and this is especially important to understand, in the view of clinical trials
that are underway with anti-Tim 3 antibodies.
As in T cells, Tim 3 is co-expressed in DCs with its adapter protein Bat-3, where Bat-3 acts as a molecular “gate-
keeper”, that restricts Tim 3 signaling and function. To understand the function of Tim 3 in DCs, we have
generated conditional “knock-out” mice of both Tim 3 and Bat-3 in DCs. Initial studies indicate that unrestricted
signaling of Tim 3 in the absence of Bat-3, makes Bat-3-deficient DCs tolerogenic such that they do not effectively
induce inflammatory T cell responses and the mice are resistant to development of autoimmunity. Based on our
preliminary data, we hypothesize that unabated Tim 3 signaling in DCs promotes generation of tolerogenic DCs.
To address this hypothesis, we propose two specific aims:
1. Determine how the Tim 3/Bat-3 interaction regulates development of tolerogenic DCs. We have observed
 that unopposed signaling of Tim 3, by deleting Bat-3, specifically in DCs inhibits development of multiple
 autoimmune diseases including Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) which is the focus
 of this proposal. Using conditional “knock-out” mice for both Tim 3 and Bat-3 in DCs, we propose to
 determine whether resistance to autoimmunity in Bat-3 cKO mice is partly or completely restored by
 deletion of Tim 3 from the same set of DCs. Furthermore, this will also allow us to determine how loss of
 Bat-3 regulates DC phenotype and function.
2. Determine the molecular mechanism by which interaction of Tim 3 and the Smad/TGF-b pathway
 promotes the generation of tolerogenic DCs. Using an unbiased proteomic screen to identify molecules
 that bind to the Tim 3 tail in the absence of Bat-3, we identified Smad-2, a transducer of TGF-b pathway,
 as a Tim 3 interacting protein. This novel observation allows us to study the mechanism by which Tim 3
 mediates its inhibitory function, specifically we will be able to determine the molecular basis by which Tim
 3/Smad/TGF-b pathway promotes the development of tolerogenic DCs. Using high density temporal
 transcriptional analysis of the Tim 3 and Bat-3 deficient DCs, we propose to develop transcriptional
 networks by which the Tim 3:Bat-3 pathway mediates its inhibitory function in DCs.
The proposed studies will identify how the Tim 3:Bat-3 pathway makes DCs tolerogenic, providing critical
information that could be exploited to benefit multiple human diseases. While repressing Tim 3 function could
augment immune responses in chronic viral infections and cancer, boosting Tim 3 signals could dampen
autoimmune diseases and promote antigen specific tolerance."
10765642,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Both neutropenic (NTP) fever and bloodstream infections (BSIs) are common complications in patients
receiving treatment for hematologic malignancy and are associated with increased length of stay, cost of care,
and mortality. Chemotherapy and neutropenia result in the disruption of the gastrointestinal mucosa, leading to
translocation of commensal bacteria from the gut, causing NTP fever, and in some cases BSI. The study of the
impact of the gut microbiome is critical to understanding the pathogenesis of, and risk for, NTP fever. To
prevent BSIs and treat NTP fever, patients are exposed to both prophylactic and empiric broad-spectrum
antibiotics. However, the decision for antibiotic prophylaxis and the choice of therapy with empiric antibiotics
are typically based on provider preference. This is due to a lack of data to inform antibiotic treatment and
selection of specific agents for individual patients. Utilizing the gut microbiome to predict NTP fever and BSI
may allow for personalized antibiotic decisions, to determine which patients will benefit most from antibiotic
prophylaxis while limiting excess antibiotic exposures in those at low risk of NTP fever and BSI.
 The candidate plans to study the ability of the early gut microbiome before and change after
chemotherapy to predict NTP fever (Aim 1.1). This includes an investigation of the impact of the gut
microbiome on measures of gut mucosal integrity and microbe-induced inflammation. This proposal also aims
to discriminate microbiome features of patients with NTP fever who ultimately develop BSI from those patients
who do not (Aim 1.2). This will be accomplished through longitudinal collection of patient samples, focusing on
a broad patient population at risk of these events, specifically patients admitted for chemotherapy and stem cell
transplantation for treatment of hematologic malignancy. In addition, the candidate will investigate the impact of
specific antibiotic exposures on the gut microbiome over the course of admission to understand how specific
antibiotic choices, including prophylaxis, impact the gut microbiome (Aim 2).
 The results of this study may allow future clinicians to utilize early gut microbiome features in patients
receiving treatment for hematologic malignancy to predict NTP fever and BSI. This knowledge will help inform
the decision for antibiotic prophylaxis using individual patient factors and will help guide selection of specific
antibiotics used for the treatment of NTP fever that also reduce the risk of microbiome disruption. The aims are
combined with a robust training plan that includes formal training and education in bioinformatics, molecular
epidemiology, and biostatistics, the development of advanced analytic skills for microbiome data, formal
benchmarks for progress including presentation at seminars and international conferences, and extensive
research experience under the guidance of an expert mentoring and advisory team. This proposal will form a
strong foundation for the candidate's continued development toward a career as an independent investigator
with a program of research focused on the prevention of infection in patients with hematologic malignancy."
10765714,"Activated synovial macrophages (M[phi]s) are major producers of pathogenic cytokines, and play a key role in
RA pathogenesis. The long term goals of this project are to understand mechanisms that regulate the
balance between activating and feedback inhibitory signaling pathways that are activated in human M[phi]s by
inflammatory factors that drive RA synovitis. An associated goal is to use this knowledge to therapeutically
modulate balance and crosstalk between signaling pathways to promote resolution of inflammation.
 Important activators of RA synovial M[phi]s include autocrine TNF, immune complexes, T cell factors,
and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) generated by tissue damage and cell death. DAMPs
that activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are amongst the most potent activators of M[phi]s and
inflammatory genes such as TNF, IL6, and IL1B, have emerged as important drivers of RA synovial M[phi]
 activation. RA synovium contains abundant DAMPs including nucleic acids (NAs) derived from dying cells
that activate intracellular RNA and DNA sensors. Interestingly, RA synovium also abundantly expresses
molecules that bind NAs and potentiate activation of endosomal NA-sensing TLRs (eTLRs: TLR3/7/8/9).
 Of the eTLRs, TLR7 and TLR8 are highly expressed in RA synovial macrophages, potently drive
inflammatory cytokine production including in RA synovial explants, and have been most closely implicated
in pathogenesis of RA and inflammatory arthritis models. Human TLR8 is selectively expressed in myeloid
cells and potently drives inflammatory cytokine production, but has been relatively understudied as mouse
TLR8 is non-functional; interestingly, BAC-transgenic mice expressing human TLR8 (hTLR8) exhibit
increased arthritis associated with erosive synovitis, high TNF, and macrophage infiltration that models RA.
 In the previous project period we focused on regulation of the balance between activating and
feedback inhibitory pathways downstream of TNF and TLR8 in human M[phi]. We found that the balance of
TLR8 signaling was shifted towards superinduction of inflammatory genes including TNF and IL6 by CXCL4,
which is highly expressed in RA synovium. CXCL4 was previously shown to augment eTLR-mediated IFN
and cytokine production in DCs by binding NAs and promoting their delivery to endolysosomal
compartments. We identified novel and complementary mechanisms whereby CXCL4 activated signaling
and chromatin remodeling in human M[phi]s to boost TLR8 responses. Our overarching hypothesis is that
CXCL4 and eTLRs like TLR8 cooperatively activate signaling and epigenetic mechanisms that result in
synergistic inflammatory gene activation, and that these mechanisms are operative in activated RA synovial
M[phi]s. We propose to investigate mechanisms underlying CXCL4-TLR8 synergy and their pathophysiological
implications for inflammatory arthritis. We anticipate our studies will yield insights that can be used to
attenuate pathologic M[phi] super-activation while leaving basal TLR responses intact for host defense."

 The development of a new pharmaceutical agent often requires the screening of millions of compounds. Such
compounds are typically derived from high-throughput syntheses, which tend to utilize a relatively small set of
reliable reactions. The limited scope of synthetic methods used in discovery chemistry has led to an
overpopulation of certain types of molecular shapes and properties, to the exclusion of others. The challenge is
to generate new classes of compounds with both diversity and complexity in a manner that is accessible to
medicinal chemists. Such methodologies would open new, more prolific chemical space for exploration in both
traditional SAR studies and the generation of fragment libraries. Research in the Harman group concentrates on
the preparation of stereochemically complex alicyclic compounds derived from simple aromatic precursors.
While previous studies from our group have included dearomatization of pyridine, furan, and pyrrole
heterocycles, this MIRA application describes the preparation of functionalized cyclohexenes from benzene. The
otherwise inert benzene ring is chemically enabled through its dihapto-coordination to the tungsten complexing
agent {WTp(NO)(PMe3)}. Over the next five years we will explore the full range of nucleophilic and electrophilic
fragments that can be added to a benzene core, as enabled by this tungsten complex. Specifically, we describe
in this application the development of a general route to the addition of so-called ""π-nucleophiles"", such as
phenols, anisoles, furans, thiophenes, and indoles, generating new sp3 stereocenters from the benzene ring
carbons. Further, we are targeting the addition of more complex nitrogen-based functional groups including
amides, imides, sulfonamides, uracils, carbazoles, and triazoles. Significantly, these nitrogen additions to the
benzene ring that create new stereocenters are practically unknown. Another research thrust in the next five
years will be to surgically manipulate the regiochemistry and stereochemistry of the cyclohexene targets,
developing general routes to 3,4- 3,5- and 3,6- disubstituted cyclohexenes with either cis- or trans-
configurations. A third major thrust will be the assembly of polycyclic cores with well-defined stereochemistry.
Using the foundations that we have developed, we are pursuing several different approaches to structurally
complex and biorelevant tri- and tetracyclic lactams and lactones. The ultimate goal of our program is to provide
access to a broad and diverse class of enantioenriched organic cyclohexenes and cyclohexanes, all prepared
from a single, logical, and highly modular platform. This dearomatization methodology will open more fertile
chemical space-- fragment libraries that feature a diverse range of complex three-dimensional architectures with
many of the functional groups common to proven pharmaceuticals. This approach not only increases the
chances for finding new lead-like compounds for pharmaceutical development with increased affinity for a
targeted binding site, but more importantly, increased specificity for that site."

Throughout the course of coevolution within their host organisms, viruses have evolved to
become masters of the cell- manipulating and exploiting cellular signaling, transport, and
trafficking pathways. Studies of basic virology offer the prospect of illuminating cellular biology
through the lens of a natural cell biologist, often (and historically) unveiling new aspects of cellular
form and function. Here we propose work to elucidate the membrane spanning and subcellular
trafficking mechanisms used by the human papillomavirus (HPV) L2 capsid protein during the
course of early infection within endo/lysosomal, retrograde transport, and Golgi compartments.
Here we will work to understand the role(s) of the local membrane microenvironment, membrane
curvature and tension, ion flux, cellular gamma secretase, and specific L2 elements (amphipathic
helix, transmembrane domain, C-terminal cell penetration peptide) in L2 membrane spanning. We
have also recently discovered that a small peptide derived from cellular sorting nexin 1 (SNX1)
potently blocks the retrograde trafficking of HPV, and we propose work to elucidate the inhibitory
mechanisms of the peptide and unveil the role(s) of the cellular SNX-BAR family of sorting nexin
proteins on L2 membrane spanning and retrograde trafficking of virus. Combined, this work will
unveil new insight into cellular biology of protein-membrane interactions, protein transport across

The human gut is a metabolic organ where anaerobic microbial pathways run at high capacity, expanding the
biochemical landscape of the human body. Exploiting members of the gut microbiota and the metabolic
pathways they encode represents an exciting new strategy to treat genetically encoded biochemical defects in
humans such as Phenylketonuria. There are three reasons why identifying new microbiota probiotics should
be a priority: 1) Gut microbes represent an important yet untapped resource for new metabolic pathways that
influence human biochemistry. 2) Microbiota pathways are present in healthy individuals, and their metabolic
end products are unlikely to be toxic to humans. 3) Native, non-genetically modified strains are likely to have a
straightforward regulatory pathway for use in humans. While this proposal is focused on identifying microbes
and pathways to reduce blood phenylalanine levels to treat phenylketonuria, our long-term goal is to lay the
foundation for an entirely new approach to treat inborn errors in metabolism: controlling metabolic circuits via
the gut microbiota. Our proposal is organized into the following two aims: In Aim 1, we will use gene cluster
searches, transcriptomics, genetics, and metabolomics to identify and characterize anaerobic pathways for
phenylalanine metabolism by gut bacteria. In Aim 2, we will assess the ability of microbial pathways to reduce
plasma Phe levels in a gnotobiotic mouse model of phenylketonuria (PKU). Our results will not only provide
new insights into how the microbiome expands the biochemical landscape of the host but will also lay the
groundwork for a new approach to treating inborn errors in metabolism."
10767812,"Genetic analyses of polygenic brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and schizophrenia
(SZ), have revealed “synaptic dysfunction” as a key cellular substrate for these disorders. Yet, translating this
synaptic hypothesis to in vitro disease modeling and extracting disease-relevant biological information has
been challenging. The PI has previously established a human neuronal model of SZ, combining isogenic
genome engineering, patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and induced neuronal
differentiation (iN cells). Human neurons bearing mutations in the synaptic cell adhesion molecule Neurexin-1
(NRXN1, 2p16.3), a bona fide risk allele for SZ, display deficits in excitatory synaptic strength and
neurotransmitter release probability as well as a consistent upregulation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent
serine protein kinase (CASK) protein level, by which the mechanism is currently not understood. It remains
unclear how these phenotypes arise and lead to synaptic pathology and abnormal neuronal networks
implicated in the disease. In this grant, we aim to understand the cell type- and developmental-specific
functions of NRXN1-CASK interaction in normal synapse development and their mechanistic contributions to
SZ. Using synaptic molecules as a proxy, we will dissect how disruptions in the synaptic pathway can prime or
actively participate in SZ. We will achieve this by studying aberrant CASK signaling in NRXN1 mutant
background (Aim 1), investigating CASK’s normal function at human synapses using CASK KO induced
neurons (Aim 2) and by revealing key cellular events mediated by NRXN1 and CASK during human forebrain
development using KO cortical spheroid models (Aim 3). Our work integrates techniques in imaging,
electrophysiology, biochemistry and single cell RNA-seq with rigorous experimental designs using isogenic
engineered and patient-derived iPSCs from multiple genetic and gender backgrounds, differentiation of pure
induced neuronal subtypes with defined synaptic characteristics and differentiation of 3-D cortical spheroids

molecular and cellular underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders and such information will translate to other
disorders of the synapse, including intellectual disability, ASDs, and bipolar and mood disorders."
10768143,"Cancer Research Training & Education Coordination Summary
The goal of Cancer Research Training & Education Coordination (CRTEC) is to ensure that Minnesota has a
continuous, robust, and diverse cancer workforce. We curate existing cancer education resources at the
Masonic Cancer Center (MCC), and identify gaps and create new programs to fill them. To improve our
abilities to attract, develop, and retain a diverse cancer workforce, we will create career stage–specific
paradigms containing common and unique resources. Common resources include evidence-based education
and professional development activities proven necessary for success at a given career stage from high school
through senior faculty. Unique resources will be customized to meet participants’ special needs as identified by
individual development plans. Shared and individualized resources will be combined to address 3 specific
aims: 1) Recruit a diverse cadre of students to cancer-focused programs; 2) Develop the academic and clinical
careers of trainees and professionals; and 3) Retain trainees and professionals in cancer-focused fields by
providing the appropriate educational, research, and collaborative environments. All efforts will be coordinated
with, and shaped by, MCC’s offices of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion (DEI) and Community Outreach and
Engagement (COE).
With CRTEC support, MCC contributes to numerous R25 and cancer-specific T32 training programs, funds
community-based participatory research, and takes advantage of training programs sponsored by the
University of Minnesota CTSA-funded Clinical and Translational Science Institute. It also supports members
with the development of grant applications.
Christopher Pennell, PhD, (Immunology Program), the Associate Director for Cancer Education & Training, has
directed the Education Office since its inception and has a long history of leading training programs, obtaining
education grant supplements, and directing education programs aimed at diverse groups from community
members to high school students to doctoral students. He also has an endowed professorship for innovative
education. He is supported by Kiara Ellis, MSW, who has directed MCC’s COE and CRTEC Offices for the
past 7 years, and Cathleen Drilling, MS, who has an Advanced Teaching Certification and direct experience
with education.
Future plans include the creation of an Education Advisory Board consisting of representatives from local
community colleges, public school science specialists, MCC Research Programs, and CTSI-Education to help
assess existing programs and to address newly identified needs. Near-peer mentoring will be implemented at
each level. Existing programs will also be expanded and improved."

How to ensure adherence to computerized cognitive training in unsupervised circumstances (e.g., at-home, self-
administered) in older adults at risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or AD related dementia (AD/ADRD) is
understudied. The objective of the R61/R33 is to refine and test a novel facial expression-based personalization
engine (FPE) for monitoring and modulating real-time effective engagement, with an ultimate goal of enhancing
long-term adherence in unsupervised cognitive training in older adults at risk for AD/ADRD. Here, Effective
engagement is defined as the extent to which someone is actively engaged and performing with significant
attention and enjoyment while training, addressing a balance between adherence and cognitive gains/plasticity
from the training. Based on previous work, including ours, we hypothesize that (1) mental fatigue revealed in
facial expressions will reflect a trainee’s degree of effective engagement, which can be modified by modulating
task novelty; (2) our proposed FPE will ensure the effective engagement in cognitive training by monitoring
trainee facial expressions and modulating training in response, promoting the trainee’s long-term adherence to
the training and cognitive plasticity. In R61 (Y1-Y2), we will generate the FPE for monitoring and modulating real-
time engagement in cognitive trainings in older adults at risk for AD/ADRD by refining our established application
programming interface using a Stage I design. In R33 (Y3-Y5), we will conduct a Stage II intervention efficacy
study comparing effective engagement and adherence in unsupervised cognitive training between training
programs with vs. without FPE in older adults at risk for AD/ADRD. We will address milestones proposed in
both stages to (a) ensure the readiness of the proposed FPE for R33 (R61 milestone) and (b) evaluate and
further revision of FPE for future implementation test (R33 milestone). Impact: the proposed FPE may assist in
monitoring and improving effective engagement and adherence in older adults with unsupervised cognitive
training. In the current application, we will test FPE in a cognitive training program called speed of processing
training. However, such FPE may be embedded to any computerized cognitive training in future studies to help
address adherence related issues."
10768586,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronically infects ~1% of the global population, predisposing patients to chronic liver
disease and liver cancer. To control and eventually eradicate this major public health threat, a molecular
understanding of the HCV surface antigens is one of highest priorities in HCV research to aid in rational design
of effective vaccines. The HCV surface envelope proteins (Env), comprised of heterodimers of the E1 and E2
glycoproteins, are responsible for viral attachment and entry into host cells and for assembly of infectious virus
particles. The E1 and E2 glycoproteins are also the main targets of neutralizing antibodies in the immune system.
The overall goals of Project 1 of this P01 proposal are to determine high-resolution structures of HCV envelope
glycoproteins and engineered vaccine antigens by X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy. The Specific
Aims of this project are (1) To determine the antigenic landscape of E1E2 immune epitopes; (2) To
determine the structure of E2 in complex with host receptor CD81; and (3) To determine the structure of
E1E2 complex. These structures will be critical for understanding the HCV entry mechanism and the immune
response at the atomic level which in turn will enable structure-based approaches for rational design and
engineering of E1E2-based vaccine candidates in Project 2 of this P01 proposal."

Project Summary / Abstract
The DF/HCC Program in Cancer Data Sciences (CDS) fosters a broad range of research in statistical,
computational, and mathematical questions that arise in cancer investigations. The interests, expertise, and
research approaches of the members contribute to the aims of the Program and DF/HCC directly and through
inter-disciplinary projects of Program members with others across population, clinical, and basic cancer
research. The focus on innovation, grant-supported research, formal training, and transdisciplinary
collaboration distinguish the CDS Program from the service focus of the Biostatistics Shared Resource.
The Program’s 62 members (46 primary and 16 secondary) represent all seven DF/HCC institutions and 13
academic departments. In 2019, peer-reviewed grant funding attributed to the Program was $9.2 million in
direct costs from the NCI and $4.0 million from other sponsors. During the current funding period, primary CDS
Program members published 1,123 cancer-relevant papers. Of these, 37% were inter-institutional, 8% were
intra-programmatic and 57% were inter-programmatic collaborations between two or more DF/HCC members.
The Program’s Specific Aims are to 1) develop and disseminate Data Science that responds to emerging
unmet needs regarding study design, data organization, data integration, and data analysis in population,
clinical, and basic cancer research studies, and 2) develop innovative new software for implementation of
these methods. To realize the full potential of these Aims, Program members collaborate extensively across
the consortium to help achieve the Cancer Center’s strategic goals. We also aim to equip a new generation of
researchers, including those from underrepresented minority backgrounds, with the creativity and quantitative
skills necessary to tackle difficult cancer problems."
10768576,"The goal of this proposal is to determine whether systemic reduction of the facilitative glucose transporter,
Glut1 (Slc2a1), prevents the major microvascular complications of diabetes: diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic
kidney disease (DKD) and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and/or augments the current standard of care
for Type 2 diabetes. Each microvascular complication is mitigated by tight glycemic control, but efforts to maintain
euglycemia in diabetic patients has been elusive. Here, we will investigate whether the systemic reduction of
Glut1 using a genetic approach prevents DR, DKD and DPN phenotypes in mouse models of both Type 1 and
Type 2 diabetes for the following reasons: (1) Glut1 is highly expressed in the retina and the cells that comprise
the inner and outer blood retinal barriers, throughout the nephron and tubules of the kidney and in the paranodal
region of the peripheral nerves as well as the Schwann cells that surround the nerves. (2) Reduction of Glut1 in
the eye via pharmacology, siRNA or genetic approaches reduces hallmarks of DR and reduction of Glut1 in
mesangial cells of the nephron prevents DKD phenotypes in mouse models of Type 1 diabetes. (3) Inhibition of
the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (Sglt2) is insufficient to fully prevent DR, DKD and DPN phenotypes. (4)
Small nucleotide polymorphisms in Glut1 are associated with increased risk of both DR and DKD. (5) Intensive
insulin therapy, which lowers prevalence of DR, DKD and DPN can regulate Glut1 at both transcription and post-
translational levels. Because Glut1 is elevated in the diabetic retina and kidney, reduced Slc2a1/Glut1 expression
and increased Glut1 turnover may contribute to the mechanism by which intensive insulin therapy reduces DR,
DKD and DPN.
 These observations form the premise for our hypothesis that reduction of Glut1 will prevent the
microvascular complications of diabetes, augment the current standard of care for Type 2 diabetes, and
contributes to the mechanism by which intensive insulin therapy confers protection against DR, DKD
and DPN. We will test this hypothesis with the following specific aims. In Aim 1 we will utilize the Glut1+/- mouse
which harbors a hemizygous Glut1 deletion to determine if systemic reduction of Glut1 prevents DR, DKD and
DPN in a STZ-induced mouse model of Type 1 diabetes or in the Leprdb/dbeNOS-/- mouse model of progressive
Type 2 diabetes. We will further determine if the addition of systemic Glut1 reduction to the current standard of
care for Type 2 diabetes, treatment of hyperglycemia (metformin), hypertension (ramipril) and inhibition of Sglt2
(empaglifozin), augments protection from diabetic phenotypes. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that intensive
insulin therapy regulates Glut1 by utilizing the STZ-induced mouse model of Type 1 diabetes. Activation of the
Forkhead Box O transcription factor, FOXO1, downstream signal transduction molecules, and Slc2a1 mRNA
levels will be measured in each microvascular tissue to determine if Glut1 can be regulated by insulin
transcriptionally. Activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and Glut1 protein levels will additionally be
measured to interrogate post-translational control of Glut1 by insulin.
 These experiments will reveal whether Glut1 contributes to the development of DR, DKD and DPN in
Type 1 and/or Type 2 diabetes and if targeted reduction of Glut1 can be considered for the future development
of novel therapeutics for the treatment of these pathologies. Nearly 25% of veterans are affected by diabetes,
making the care and treatment of DR, DKD and DPN of great significance for the VHA."
10768577,"Obesity continues to escalate as a significant public health problem and as the leading preventable cause of
death. Stark data from COVID19 pandemic shows obesity is an independent risk factor of severity with 33%
mortality rate. Obesity per se is not fatal but is the major health risk factor promoting severe diseases including
cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and certain cancers. 42% of adult population in US is obese
(CDC NCHS report 2020). Healthcare costs related to obesity account for greater than 10% of total US
medical expenditures and has risen to $254 billion per year (1). Alarmingly 78% of the Veteran population is
obese, a notably higher percent compared to civilian population(2).
 Adipose tissue is an important endocrine regulator of energy homeostasis and metabolism. During
adipogenesis, the adipose stem cells (ASC) differentiate into adipocytes and replenish the body’s need for
new adipocytes. Normal adiposity is exaggerated in obesity and is accompanied by adipocyte hyperplasia
and hypertrophy. Previously this lab demonstrated that obesity changes the human adipose stem cells’ niche
such that it promotes a microenvironment conducive to developing obesity-associated comorbidities. A
significant finding was that the expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) differed in the obese ASC
compared to lean subjects which contributed to the aberrant metabolic processes, insulin resistance and
chronic low-grade inflammation observed in obesity. Using an unbiased transcriptomic screening, this lab
identified lncRNA GAS5 as an important regulatory gene that is depleted in human obese adipose tissue,
ASC and mature adipocytes compared to lean. Prior research has demonstrated that GAS5 regulates insulin
receptor and glucocorticoid receptor mediated pathways. However, the importance and impact of low GAS5
levels on the metabolic pathways in obese adipocytes has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Hence, it is
hypothesized that low levels of GAS5 substantially contributes to the manifestation of comorbidities
associated with obesity. Towards the overarching goal to determine if GAS5 supports healthy adipocytes, the
proposal will evaluate the underlying mechanisms and role of GAS5 in human obese ASC and adipocytes
using a multi-disciplinary approach including pre-clinical, physiological, cellular and biochemical experiments.
Specific Aim 1: Determine the role of GAS5 in ASC and adipocytes: It is hypothesized that manipulating
GAS5 levels will affect the metabolic health of ASC and adipocytes. GAS5 siRNA or over-expression plasmid
will be used to evaluate the genetic and metabolic parameters pertaining to adipocyte health and function.
Specific Aim 2: Elucidate molecular mechanisms regulated by GAS5 in obese adipocytes: GAS5 levels are
low in ASC and adipose tissue in obesity. A small molecule that stabilizes GAS5 has been recently developed.
It is hypothesized that stabilizing GAS5 levels could alleviate the metabolic stress and the project will use this
compound as a molecular tool to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms with functional readouts.
Specific Aim 3: Investigate the impact of GAS5 stabilization in vivo in an obese mouse model: The in vitro
data shows that the small molecule targeting GAS5 increases IR levels, restores insulin signaling and
regulates GR-target genes. This aim will systematically elucidate the physiological effects of stabilizing GAS5
with the novel therapeutic in a diet-induced obese mouse model.
 Overall, this project fills significant gaps in knowledge to understand the role of lncRNAs in the
metabolic processes affecting adipose tissue in obesity in humans. Identification of GAS5 as a druggable
RNA target in a metabolic disease has led to successfully develop a small molecule therapeutic that stabilizes
GAS5 (a frontier in genomic medicine) with a high potential of promoting the metabolic health of ASC and
adipocytes in obesity. This project will have a considerable impact to prevent or treat metabolic dysfunction
associated with obesity, thus impeding the ascent of obesity as the most preventable cause of death."
10768658,"Abstract
The insulin receptor substrate proteins Irs1 and Irs2 mediate insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) throughout the body—
including the brain—and mice that lack Irs1 and Irs2 develop insulin resistance and metabolic disease. While
substantial evidence exists that peripheral insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) exacerbate age-related
cognitive decline and ADRD (Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia), ascertaining causation by either
impaired central IIS or ‘metabolic sequelae’ of peripheral metabolic disease requires model systems that can
yield mechanistic insights. Above all, experimental systems are required that allow measurement of
parameters relevant to human cognitive impairment across a range of well-controlled conditions. Our approach
satisfies this imperative through routinized analyses of hippocampal function—including partially hippocampus-
dependent spatial learning in the Morris water maze (MWM) and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the
hippocampus (DG). These assays are validated by our preliminary studies on mice lacking Irs2 in neurons
(nIrs2-/- mice), and extended in our approach to mice with unique central (neuronal) and peripheral (e.g.
pancreas or liver) expression of Irs1 and Irs2, plus down-stream Foxo1. We moreover analyze directly central
IIS mediated by Irs1 and Irs2 in the hippocampus, together with its possible feedback regulation by multi-site
serine/threonine phosphorylation of Irs1 and Irs2 (pS/TIrs). AIM1 tests the possibly unique roles of neuronal Irs1
and Irs2 to mediate central IIS—answering whether the benefits to hippocampal function of attenuated
neuronal IIS via Irs2 seen in nIrs2-/- mice owe to compensatory upregulation of neuronal IIS via Irs1. AIMs 2-3
focus on the mechanistic significance of metabolic sequela. Since high blood glucose and compensatory
insulin hypersecretion are prominent metabolic sequelae of T2D, AIM2 takes a novel approach to restore Irs2
expression in beta cells (reducing glucose) or liver (reducing glucose and insulin) in diabetic Irs2 knockout
mice. AIM3 exploits our established LDKO and LTKO mouse models—which lack hepatic Irs1 and Irs2
(diabetic) or Irs1 and Irs2, plus Foxo1 (non-diabetic). First, AIM 3 compares hippocampal function in LDKO vs
LTKO mice created acutely using viral Cre. Second, since our published work supports a role of hepatic FoxO1
and increased liver-secreted hepatokine follistatin (Fst) in propagating hepatic insulin resistance to other
tissues, AIM 3 employs viral methods to restore FoxO1 expression in LTKO mice, or to knock down expression
of Fst in LDKO mice, investigating in detail the effects on hippocampal function. How insulin resistance and
diabetes promote cognitive decline is an important clinical and research question. Together, the proposed
experiments can elucidate connections between metabolic disease and cognitive dysfunction by dissecting
roles of neuronal Irs1 and Irs2, and determining the specific influences of impaired peripheral insulin sensitivity
and associated metabolic sequelae upon hippocampal function."

Children’s socioeconomic status (SES) is strongly associated with disparities in cognitive, linguistic, and
academic development. Understanding the precise environmental and neurodevelopmental mechanisms that
underlie these disparities is critical for developing maximally impactful interventions to reduce and ultimately
ameliorate achievement gaps. This proposal will test an innovative developmental model in which specific
features of children’s early language input engage the development of cascading frontotemporal neural networks
that ultimately scaffold multiple aspects of social-cognitive development, including children’s language abilities
as well as executive functioning and social cognition—critical school readiness skills that are known to contribute
to SES achievement gaps in school. Two multimodal longitudinal studies will evaluate evidence for this
hypothesis at multiple time scales, while also providing the candidate with crucial training to promote transition
to research independence. Study 1 (K99 phase) will conduct novel analyses on existing data from a densely
sampled longitudinal study of over 300 SES-diverse children across 10 years from preschool through late
childhood/early adolescence. Aim 1 will investigate the role of specific features of early language input (linguistic
vs. interactive) on SES differences in developmental trajectories of executive functioning and social cognition as
they emerge across the preschool years (ages 3-5 years). Aim 2 will extend this investigation into long-term
neurocognitive outcomes by evaluating whether early language input acts as a long-range mechanism
influencing brain structure and functioning later in childhood that supports continued cognitive and social
development, which may ultimately underlie SES disparities in academic achievement. Study 2 (R00 phase) will
deepen the specific investigation of the dynamic development of these neurocognitive mechanisms in preschool
through longitudinal study of a new cohort of children at ages 3 and 4 years. Aim 3 will specifically examine the
influence of features of early language input on plasticity of interactive frontotemporal neural systems supporting
linguistic, executive, and social cognition through preschool and the transition to Kindergarten. Results from both
studies will help identify the precise components of early linguistic stimulation that drive development across
multiple neurocognitive domains during a critical period of brain development, and determine the mechanisms
by which exposures to specific social and environmental factors affect long-term neurodevelopment,
neuroplasticity, and cognitive outcomes. Further, this work has direct translational implications to inform
interventions that may help close and ultimately prevent income-achievement gaps and provide optimal
neurodevelopmental outcomes for children from all backgrounds. This award will also provide the candidate,
who has a strong background in the cognitive neuroscience of language development, with critical training in
other domains of cognitive development and advanced analysis techniques to promote a successful transition
to an independent research career."

Disparities in the incidence and prognosis of cancer in the United States are widespread, well documented,
and persistent. Still, there remains a critical need to thoughtfully examine and address the myriad factors
contributing to these disparities. For the past 20 years, we have conducted a Training Program in cancer
prevention and survival (15 years as an R25, 5 years as a T32), with an emphasis on the roles of nutrition,
lifestyle factors, and genetics in cancer. We have had substantial success in trainee degree completion,
recruitment of trainees from underrepresented backgrounds, and placement of pre- and postdoctoral fellows in
research-related positions. With this renewal, we are proposing to reframe the focus of our Program to support
trainees in the pursuit of research on cancer health disparities and the social determinants of health that drive
those disparities. The objective of this Program is to advance opportunities for trainees, particularly those from
underrepresented backgrounds, in research for the reduction and elimination of cancer health disparities. In
pursuit of this objective, we will provide trainees with 1) formal coursework in cancer epidemiology, social
determinants of health, and cancer disparities, 2) experiences in epidemiologic research, with an emphasis on
cancer epidemiology and health disparities research, and 3) skills and practice in grant writing, disseminating
scientific findings, and developing a long-term career plan. Together, these activities will support our trainees in
preparing them for careers in impactful research. We propose to train 4 pre- and 3 postdoctoral trainees each
year. Formal coursework and degrees will be based in the University of Washington (UW) Department of
Epidemiology. Trainees will gain practical experience in epidemiologic research within the UW Department of
Epidemiology and at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. Trainees will have access to considerable resources
and 26 exceptional faculty mentors at these two partner institutions. New faculty mentors have been added to
provide expertise in health disparities and social determinants of health, along with several junior faculty co-
mentors with innovative research directly relevant to the goals of this Training Program. This Training Program
will be led by two Program Directors, both of whom hold joint appointments at the two participating institutions
and share a history of collaborative research in studies of cancer disparities: Dr. Amanda Phipps is an
Associate Professor and Associate Chair at the UW Department of Epidemiology; Dr. Christopher Li is a
Professor, the Vice President for Faculty Affairs and Inclusion, and Associate Director of the Office of Diversity,
Equity, and Inclusion at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. Through the support of Drs. Phipps and Li, the
oversight of knowledgeable internal and external advisors, and the guidance of outstanding Program faculty
mentors, trainees who complete this Training Program will have the knowledge and skills to conduct impactful
independent research addressing the root causes and consequences of cancer health disparities."
10929447,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Remarkable gains have been made in the treatment of pediatric cancers over the past 60 years resulting in a
growing population of long-term survivors of childhood cancer that is currently estimated to exceed 500,000.
Many long-term survivors experience chronic health conditions and poor health behaviors, which significantly
contributes to medical burden and impacts functional outcomes and quality of life. Research on long-term
survivors of pediatric cancer is continually informing the design of new treatment approaches for newly
diagnosed patients, with the objective of minimizing long-term therapy-related morbidity and mortality. As the
majority of children diagnosed with cancer will become long-term survivors and will be at risk for experiencing
multiple complications following treatment, continued research is needed to enhance health and functional
outcomes. Future research efforts will require well-trained independent investigators from the fields of oncology,
epidemiology, behavioral and social sciences, biostatistics, cancer biology and genetics, health services, and
other allied health disciplines. While some T32-funded cancer training programs offer training opportunities in
cancer survivorship, few academic institutions possess the resources and large multidisciplinary team that St.
Jude does to provide in-depth post-doctoral research training focusing on pediatric cancer populations.
Currently, we have the only NIH-funded training program with a primary focus on pediatric cancer survivorship.
The purpose of our training program is to develop the next generation of scientific leaders with the
interdisciplinary skills and knowledge that is necessary to become world-class competitive scientists in the area
of pediatric cancer survivorship. The key elements to the program includes: a Scholarship Oversight Team
comprised of primary and secondary mentors and a clinical collaborator; a Management Committee to review
program progress; an Advisory Committee; clinical and research training relating to cancer survivorship and
pediatric oncology; a formal but flexible MSc curriculum in clinical investigation and a MPH curriculum in
epidemiology, biostatistics or health systems policy; training in scientific writing, grant preparation and grant
review; and a detailed evaluation that will track the ongoing progress of the trainees in their subsequent
careers. We have just completed the 4th year of the new program and have graduated four postdoctoral
fellows, three of whom have gone into academia and one into industry. We have a new class of trainees
progressing well. Of note, one of the former trainees and one of the current trainees are under-represented
minorities, Black and Hispanic respectively, and one comes from an economically disadvantaged background.
For this competing renewal, we have significantly enhanced the program with required “light”, and optional
“deep”, experiences in both Global Health, which has been part of the program from the start but is not
formalized. The innovation and uniqueness of the program includes its comprehensive focus on pediatric
cancer survivorship across the lifespan of the survivor."
10770435,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Experiments in this proposal will advance our understanding of mechanisms responsible for the development of
precise neural circuitry in the mammalian brain. Patterned activity is critical for normal development of neural
circuits, and deficits in activity-dependent circuit refinement are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders
such as Fragile X syndrome, autism, and amblyopia. Amblyopia is the most common cause of monocular visual
impairment among young and middle-aged adults, with approximately 3 in 100 children effected. Amblyopia is
characterized by a range of deficits in spatial vision, spatial contrast sensitivity, and other tasks. However, the
mechanisms of this maladaptation are not well understood. We will employ a broad range of techniques,
including molecular biological, cell biological, neuroanatomical, electrophysiological and advanced optical
imaging techniques in vitro and in vivo. We focus our experiments on neural circuits in the midbrain superior
colliculus and visual cortex of the mouse. Beyond the retina, these areas are the largest visual structures in the
brain. The superior colliculus is a sensory motor structure that has emerged as an ideal model system for the
examination of neural circuit development and function. The visual cortex is a canonical model system for the
study of higher order brain function and development in mammals. It is widely hypothesized that molecular cues
are responsible for the establishment of gross brain circuit features, and activity dependent processes
subsequently refine these circuits to functional precision. The emergence of visual circuit features before the
onset of sensory experience suggests that visual map formation is first initiated by activity-independent
mechanisms, such as axon guidance molecules, then refined by pre-vision correlated spontaneous activity, and
later maintained and sharpened by visual experience after eye-opening. Spontaneous bursting of retinal ganglion
cells results in propagating waves of activity that change with age based on their primary excitatory drive. Initially
characterized in vitro, stage I waves occur before birth and are mediated by gap junctions between retinal
ganglion cells. Stage II occur from birth until around P10 and are mediated by cholinergic starburst amacrine
cells. Stage III waves are glutamatergic in origin, with bipolar cells providing the primary excitatory drive onto
retinal ganglion cells from P10 until eye-opening. This project aims to examine the specific spatiotemporal
features and the underlying cellular mechanisms by which retinal waves are instructive for the development of
higher order circuits and neuronal response properties, in both subcortical and cortical circuits, prior to eye
opening."

the ANCHR, including a diverse group of internal and external experts with a spectrum of interests that align
with our Center’s priorities and values. Dr. Thomas is responsible for overseeing the Center as PI, and the
Administrative Core is led by Dr. Ferucci. The specific aims of the Administrative Core are to: 1) Provide
scientific, administrative, and fiscal support and oversight to all components of the Center; 2) Develop and
implement comprehensive training to build the research skills and knowledge essential for the success of
current and potential research project leads (RPLs), mentors, and the Center’s research community; 3)
Coordinate with the Advisory Committee to obtain regular input on the Center, including at least biannual
review of the Center's progress, guidance on recruitment of new RPLs, and review and selection of
replacement research projects; and 4) Evaluate and monitor all Center activities, including RPL development
and mentoring, according to the proposed timeline and evaluation plan. Our long-term goal is to strengthen
ANTHC and Alaska’s research capacity to address health disparities among Alaska Native people, ultimately
to improve the health of the population in alignment with ANTHC’s vision that Alaska Native people are the
healthiest people in the world. The proposed ANCHR has the potential to significantly improve the capacity of
ANTHC and other organizations to conduct research that will improve the health of Alaska Native people and
reduce health disparities in Alaska. Having a tribal health organization lead this Center is innovative and makes
the ANCHR well-poised to address health disparities in a culturally informed manner."
10770963,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Research Project 2: “A public health practice investigation
exploring the impact of community water fluoridation among American Indian and Alaska Native
populations in Alaska”
Recent trends towards community water fluoridation (CWF) cessation raise concerns regarding potential oral
health disparities and the drivers of community decisions regarding CWF. Policy makers, dental and health
providers and public health practitioners’ evidence-based recommendations, to facilitate informed CWF
decisions and ensure oral health promotion efforts are appropriately prioritized. The long-term goal of this
project is to strengthen evidence-based, audience-specific recommendations regarding oral health program
planning especially among American Indian and Alaska Native populations who may suffer disproportionately
more negative oral health outcomes secondary to state and local water policy processes. The objective of this
application is to conduct a quantitative retrospective study to assess measures of decay prevalence utilizing
electronic health records, and identify health provider, policy-maker, and community characteristics associated
with local water policy decisions, and ballot box outcomes, respectively, as they relate to CWF. The rationale
for the project is that analysis of changes in oral health outcomes and associated economic impacts when
CWF is ceased is limited. Similarly, an understanding of the predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors that
drive CWF policy decisions in Alaska is lacking. The project will pursue three specific aims: (1) Explore utilizing
electronic dental records as a population health surveillance tool for specific age groups by region and
exposure to optimal or sub-optimal levels of CWF.; (2) examine, via survey, health care providers’ knowledge,
beliefs, and practices associated with CWF, fluoride applications and other supplementation and any patterns
associated with demographics and fluoridation status in their community of practice; and (3) Analyze local
policy-making processes and community characteristics associated with CWF through a systematic review of
publicly available documents and policy-making actions through mixed-methods analysis of relevant
government agency and public utility databases, traditional and social media, and local governing body

surveillance strategy and it reignites a body of research on the topic of provider, policy-maker, and community
characteristics and their association with CWF decisions amidst a modern social, political, economic, and
technological landscape. The proposed research is significant because the results can inform health equity-
oriented public policies that prioritize American Indian and Alaska Native health, support Tribal Health
Organization dental and health providers with training and communication tools, and may yield a set of

10770977,"PROJECT SUMMARY – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Administrative Core will provide organizational, fiscal, and scientific management of our Center for
Cardiovascular Research in Biomechanics (CRiB) and help it obtain national and international recognition. The
Core will implement multi-level mentoring strategies for faculty development, a pilot project program, and
strategic planning and comprehensive evaluation that will help our CRiB Center achieve its three goals of 1)
advancing research supporting the development of better cardiovascular materials and devices, 2) instituting an
effective multidisciplinary mentoring program for junior faculty, and 3) developing self-sustainability. To
accomplish this, the Administrative Core will use a five-prone approach. First, it will provide direction and
administrative support to the CRiB Center projects and the Tissue Analysis Core (TAC), help our Research
Project Leaders (RPLs) stay on track with achieving their goals, and manage fiscal and personnel matters.
Second, the Administrative Core will coordinate a comprehensive mentoring program for RPLs leading the CRiB
Center projects by pairing each junior investigator with senior NIH-funded clinicians and basic scientists, thereby
enhancing their ability to obtain extramural funding while ensuring that their projects remain translational. Third,
the Administrative Core will support the functions of the Advisory Committees, which will include the External
(EAC), Internal (IAC), and Administrative (AAC) components. The AAC will advise on operational issues and
strengthen the ties with IDeA-funded partners. The IAC will assist in strategic decisions, coordinate with local
administration, and help facilitate the mentoring program. Feedback from the AAC and IAC will inform the EAC,
which will provide oversight, guide strategic planning, coordinate mentoring, select pilot projects, approve new
faculty hires, and facilitate RPL professional development. Fourth, the Administrative Core will maintain a
pipeline of high-quality RPLs for the Center by recruiting new faculty to CRiB and attracting new members
through the pilot project program, outreach activities, seminar series, journal clubs, Annual COBRE Research
Day Conference, and presence at national and international conferences. Lastly, the Administrative Core will
organize Center-wide scientific and career development activities for RPLs, including grant writing workshops,
professional meetings, “mock panel” grant reviews, solicit input from external grant reviewers and grant editors
to provide feedback to the RPLs on their applications, and support RPL graduate students with scholarships.
Together, these activities will ensure the smooth operation of our Center, promote effective leadership under the
direction of the PD/PI and the Associate Director, and ensure the synergistic function of the Advisory Committees
that will all contribute to the sustained growth of our program."

Over 1 billion people around the world will be significantly impacted by a neurological disorder during their
lifetime. Better understanding of the underlying pathobiological mechanisms and the development of new
treatment paradigms is critical to mitigate the impact and/or cure these diseases. Neurosurgeon-scientists
have a unique opportunity to fundamentally advance understanding into ineffectively treated or untreatable
neurologic disorders. Specifically, neurosurgeons can directly access human physiologic data, acquire
nervous system lesions/tissue, develop/employ new surgical treatment technology, as well as make direct
associations between the operating room and clinical findings. Moreover, they have the potential to
collaborate with scientists from other disciplines to most effectively advance critical discoveries and develop
new therapeutic paradigms. Consequently, defined and robust training of neurosurgeon-scientists is urgently
needed.
To enhance research training and best support the successful transition from residency to an independent
neurosurgeon-scientist career, we are applying for National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
(NINDS) R25 in Neurological Surgery at the Ohio State University (OSU). The overarching objective of this
program is to provide research training to neurosurgery residents in the basic, translational and/or clinic
sciences that will drive their successful transition to independent National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded
neurosurgeon-scientists after residency. This program is led by 2 senior investigators (Drs. Herson and
Lonser) who have implemented a research curriculum and programmatic changes to maximize the impact of
the R25 on selected neurosurgery residents at OSU. The training plan is supported by senior faculty with a
track record of mentoring/funding success and leverages the research infrastructure across the OSU campus."

nearing a steady state goal of 120). The current 5-year proposal requests 30 NIH-funded positions with the
following intended training outcomes: 1) acquired knowledge, skills, experiences and attitudes leading to
successful physician-scientist careers impacting a wide range of health-related research needs; 2) established
scientific expertise and published rigorous and impactful research work guided by strong mentorship; 3)
thriving ,resilient and diverse graduates retained in the physician-scientist pipeline through professional and
career development; 4) timely completion of training in 8 years or less facilitated by curricular innovations that
have further streamlined dual degree training; and 5) recruitment of a diverse and inclusive cohort of trainees
best positioned to address current disparities in health and disease outcomes in our Nation."
10770555,"Project Summary/Abstract
MicroRNAs are critical gene expression regulators implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS)
and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, specific miRNA pathways
that directly connect clinical activity with pathogenic and regulatory immune mechanisms in EAE and MS
remains unclear. Recently, we identified a clinically relevant miRNA, miR-92a, whose expression is highly
increased in MS patients and strongly associated with clinical disease activity and pathological immune
mechanisms in EAE and MS. Specifically, our data suggest miR-92a promotes CNS inflammation by inhibiting
Tregs and promoting Th17 and Th1 effector functions. MiR-92a levels are increased in EAE, and that miR-92a
loss strikingly attenuates EAE. This attenuation is associated with increased Treg and decreased Th17
frequency, as well as decreased Th1/Th17 pathogenic effector molecules, notably GM-CSF. Mechanistically,
miR-92a appears to inhibit Treg differentiation, stability, and suppressive function by directly targeting Foxo1.
MiR-92a also promotes Th17 development by modulating Foxo1. In non-pathogenic Th17 cells, miR-92a
inhibition of Foxo1 relieves RORgt from Foxo1-mediated inhibition, which in turn upregulates the Th17
transcriptional program. In pathogenic Th17 cells, miR-92a targeting of Foxo1 relieves IL-23R and IL-1R from
Foxo1-mediated inhibition. This then enhances responsiveness to IL-23 and IL-1b, as well as GM-CSF
production. In Th1 cells, miR-92a is dispensable for initial differentiation, but also promotes GM-CSF by
targeting the Foxo1. Accordingly, T cell-specific deletion of miR-92a is sufficient to attenuate EAE, and miR-
92a inhibitor therapeutic effectively ameliorates EAE. Analogous to mice, miR-92a inhibits Tregs, while
promoting Th17 development, in humans. Most importantly, miR-92a is increased in MS patient sera, which
correlates with disease across multiple clinical parameters, including neurological symptoms and brain atrophy.
We also show an increase in miR-92a in MS CD4+ T cells, which is associated with altered Treg/Th17 markers
in MS. These findings suggest the pathogenic miR-92a-mediated pathways that mediate EAE may also
modulate MS pathogenesis. Therefore, we will test our hypothesis that miR-92a promotes neuroinflammation
in EAE and MS by two interlinked mechanisms: 1) inhibiting the development and function of Tregs; and 2)
promoting pathogenic Th17/Th1 effector functions. In Aim 1, we will investigate the molecular mechanisms by
which miR-92a control the balance of regulatory and inflammatory T cells in EAE and test the therapeutic
efficacy of silencing miR-92a in clinically relevant EAE models. In Aim 2, we will investigate in humans the
molecular mechanisms by which miR-92a controls the development of regulatory and inflammatory T cells and
also study miR-92a as a biomarker, and miR-92a function, in MS and MS patient T cells. MiR-92a is of unique
significance because it constitutes a single target modulating multiple T cell pathways in EAE/MS. Our findings
will help navigate critical miR-92a-related mechanisms in MS that could underlie new therapeutic avenues."

This application seeks to renew the funding for the T32 training program at Washington University for physician
and doctoral scientists pursuing a career in anesthesiology-related research. The practice of anesthesiology is
complex and far reaching. The research interests of anesthesiology span this broad clinical realm and have the
potential to impact medicine as a whole. Developments in basic and clinical science have made the fundamental
unsolved problems in anesthesiology research scientifically tractable. Despite the potential of its research
programs for broad scientific and therapeutic impact, anesthesiology lags behind other specialties in training
physicians and basic scientists in research. Our program is directed at meeting this need. The overarching goal
is to train a diverse group of anesthesiology scientists with appropriate scientific skills to address the research
priorities in anesthesiology-related science. To accomplish this, we focus on: (i) recruiting and training a diverse
group of talented early stage anesthesiology scholars; (ii) identifying training opportunities in high priority and
high yield scientific areas; (iii) providing expert, accountable and dedicated research mentorship; (iv)
programmatically and systematically enhancing research training; (v) assessing trainee’s personalized goals and
progress; (vi) providing state-of-the art curricula and facilities as well as networking and educational
opportunities; and (vii) providing ongoing mentoring to T32 alumni to facilitate their transition to careers as
independent investigators. The Washington University Anesthesiology Department is among the highest funded
and most research productive anesthesiology departments in the United States. T32 trainees in the
Anesthesiology Department are typically selected from a cohort of research residents, which is one of the largest
nationally, based on the vibrant and highly effective Academic Scholars Advancement Program and the Scholars
track. Graduates from our T32 have published high impact research, obtained competitive training grants, and
continued in academic faculty appointments. Two program directors (PDs), an associate program director (APD)
and an executive advisory committee (EAC) administer the training program. Mentors for the program have been
carefully chosen based on the quality and relevance of their science and demonstrated mentorship experience
and success. Trainee-mentor pairing is facilitated and approved by the PDs, APD and EAC. Trainees and
mentors are formally evaluated twice annually for progress and satisfaction. Emphasis during these evaluations
is placed on progress towards development of an independent research program, acquisition of career skills and
attaining milestones such as manuscript and grant submissions. The PDs, APD, EAC and the trainees evaluate
the training program annually, and make ongoing recommendations for improvements. Our program also plays
a leadership role in the Early Stage Anesthesiology Scholars (eSAS) initiative and in collaborative ventures with
other national T32 programs. Therefore, our T32 trainees also develop key networking and leadership abilities."
10769119,"Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) progressively impair essential cognitive and mental functions, resulting in significant emotional, physical, and financial burdens. Genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of loci contributing to the risk of more than a hundred serious mental and neurological disorders (SMND), including AD/ADRD and others such as schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. Integrating risk loci with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for molecular traits, such as gene expression and epigenome regulation, in human brain tissue, has been widely adopted as an analytical strategy to nominate causal mechanisms for AD/ADRD and SMNDs. So far, large-scale integrative analyses using this approach have utilized homogenate brain tissue, which is composed of multiple cell types, and therefore cell-type-specific QTLs are not fully captured. This is an important limitation given that risk variants for AD/ADRD and SMNDs act through cell-type-specific biological mechanisms. Initial efforts have included cell-type-specific QTL analysis in the human brain by utilizing single-cell data, but the sample size of such studies is hindered by the increased experimental costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose to establish the brain single-cell xQTL (BrainCellQTL) Consortium that brings together existing resources of more than 10,000 single-cell libraries from more than 3,000 unique brain donors, as well as expertise in single-cell biology, neuroscience, statistical genetics and machine learning, to facilitate the harmonization of brain single-cell data, QTL generation and data sharing with the scientific community. Activities will be organized around the Synapse Data Platform by Sage Bionetworks, an NIH-Designated Generalist Repository that supports dozens of research consortia, focused on neurodegeneration, neuropsychiatric disease, cancer, rare disease, and other research areas. The Synapse Data Platform will be utilized to receive data, validate it against metadata and data standards, and harmonize them for downstream analysis. To increase the reproducibility and transparency of BrainCellQTL consortium research, we will use CAVATICA by Seven Bridges for data processing and analysis. CAVATICA is a secure, scalable, and extendable data commons platform that empowers collaboration and scientific analysis. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, we expect to construct a cell type-specific QTL atlas for the human brain, which we will use to derive genetically driven gene dysregulation in AD/ADRD and SMNDs, thus, enabling us to: (1) increase our mechanistic understanding of dysfunction in AD/ADRD and SMNDs; (2) better prioritize significant genes and molecular pathways for future mechanistic studies; (3) provide a valuable resource that can be applied in ongoing and future genome-wide association studies; (4) provide preprocessed and harmonized single-nucleus brain omics data that can be utilized by the research community to address other biologically-driven questions; and (5) establish a mechanism for data sharing and harmonization across consortia and projects, which can be utilized in future studies to perform single-cell mega-analyses and meta-analyses."

 Children with medical complexity are a growing population of medically fragile patients with disability.
Children with medical complexity experience ~70% of unplanned hospital readmissions and have a 10x
higher odds of mortality compared to other children. These children’s daily survival requires parents and home
nurses to safely administer intricate medication regimens through implanted devices, such as a tube inserted
into the stomach. While we know that medication errors or device-related adverse events are happening
at home, no home healthcare reporting or response standards exist to address and prevent them.
Voluntary reporting does not equitably capture events in children of minority backgrounds or necessarily
address prevention. Parents express fear of losing their child’s nursing care or their child’s custody if they raise
safety concerns, especially those of racial minority backgrounds. While home is an essential healthcare site for
CMC, no scientific approaches exist to make sure healthcare safety events do not happen at home. There is a
critical need to identify, communicate, and prevent safety errors and adverse events that occur in the home by
diverse parents and home healthcare providers in a manner that will make sure the children are okay, notifies
the children’s care providers, prevents recurrence, and is equitable to all patients and families.
 Our specific aims are to 1) construct the SafeCare@Home4Kids multidisciplinary lab of experts,
including in patient safety, human factors engineering, nursing, pediatrics, HHC, informatics, and lived family
experience to work together to design innovative, effective, and equitable approaches to prevent healthcare
safety errors and adverse events experienced by diverse CMC at home; 2) determine how family caregivers
and home nurses currently identify, communicate, and prevent medication and device-related errors
and adverse events in the context of the home work system; and 3) co-design, implement, and evaluate a
safety toolkit that addresses these elements of medication and device safety using input from families, home
nurses, prescribing providers, and our lab experts, to improve patient safety at home.
 Our pediatric PSLL will be an innovative paradigm shift in safety research by focusing on the home as a
fundamental healthcare practice setting for CMC. This work is significant because SafeCare@Home4Kids
serves intersecting AHRQ priority populations who may not otherwise be empowered or supported to
address the safety of their healthcare and addresses common reasons children with medical complexity
use the emergency department or are hospitalized. By using a human factors engineering approach with
national interdisciplinary experts, partnering with patient family leaders, and recruiting a linguistically and
racially diverse participant population, we will advance whole-person 360-degree by equitably impacting the
safety of care no matter where a child calls home."

Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and its product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) are major mediators
of inflammation in cancer cells. In this competitive renewal application, our new
directions are built on discoveries made during the previous funding period. With
imaging we uncovered the role of COX-2 in mechanotransduction, its impact on
attracting cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), altering collagen fiber structure and
function, and increasing metastasis. We found that COX-2 overexpression in tumors
impacted tumor and spleen metabolism that opens the possibility of spleen dysregulation
contributing to tumors escaping immune surveillance. In our efforts to downregulate
COX-2 in tumors with siRNA delivery, we found that most nanoparticles (NPs)
significantly increased COX-2, until we developed a biocompatible translatable dextran
NP that successfully delivered COX-2 siRNA to effectively decrease COX-2 and PGE2 in
cancer cells and tumors. These observations have resulted in our three new aims that
focus on advancing our understanding COX-2 in cancer, and in developing translatable
strategies to target COX-2 and CAFs. In Aim 1 will investigate the role of COX-2 in
altering extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and composition, and the impact of
eliminating CAFs that are a source of COX-2, on the ECM and on tumor immune cells
and metastasis. In Aim 2 we will identify the causes of the metabolic changes in the
tumor and spleen caused by COX-2, and the effects of eliminating CAFs on tumor and
spleen metabolism, and splenocytes. In Aim 3 we will downregulate COX-2 in
established tumors with siRNA and determine the impact on the ECM, metabolism, and
immune cells. A small component of this Aim will include developing cytokine
scavenging NPs that are based on the modified dextran NP we developed. We will
evaluate the ability of these NPs to reduce cytokines in tumor interstitial fluid. The
studies will be performed with triple negative breast cancer models genetically
engineered to overexpress or downregulate COX-2 in immune suppressed and immune
competent mice. These studies may lead to ECM modification strategies, including CAF
elimination, to alter ECM stiffness to reduce cancer aggressiveness, and may result in
new metabolic targets and biomarkers for immunotherapy, as well as new strategies to
convert an immune suppressive tumor microenvironment into an immune active one.

ABSTRACT
Despite eradication efforts, ~400,000 African children sustained brain injuries as a result of CNS malaria in
2016. A higher maximum temperature (Tmax) during the acute malaria infection is an established risk factor for
neurologic sequelae and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of aggressive antipyretic therapy with
acetaminophen and ibuprofen began enrollment in Malawi in 2019 (R01NS102176) with expansion into
Zambia pending. In this clinical trial, the primary outcome is Tmax during the acute infection. However, the
antipyretic therapies used in this RCT may offer neuroprotective benefits without affecting Tmax--for example,
neuroprotection through anti-inflammatory mechanisms. In this ancillary study, we propose to use
neuroimaging in the context of the RCT to further evaluate the potential neuroprotective effects of aggressive
antipyretic therapy for CNS malaria and explore possible mechanisms for these effects. Comparing children
allocated to aggressive antipyretic therapy vs. usual care on the prevalence of structural brain abnormalities
after recovery from CNS malaria will facilitate the evaluation of non-fever pathways for neuroprotection. Both
Zambia and Malawi have an unusually well developed infrastructure for advanced imaging in the academic
Brain MRIs will be obtained in
children enrolled in the RCT at 1- and 12-months post recovery. Analyses will be completed comparing the
odds of having any structural injury based upon RCT treatment allocation and based upon (Tmax) stratified by
treatment allocation to assess changes specifically related to response to therapy in terms of fever reduction.
Potential mechanisms of aggressive antipyretic-related injury will be evaluated including assessments for
treatment-related CNS bleeds. Neuroimaging is a well-established, valid proxy for neurological outcomes after
brain injury including in pediatric CNS malaria. Adding this MRI ancillary study to our fever RCT may elucidate
mechanisms of treatment-associated injury and allow for early identification of neuroprotection from aggressive
antipyretic use that would otherwise require long-term follow-up for cognitive and behavioral assessments. This
MRI ancillary study when added to the Fever RCT will provide critical insights that could inform future
neuroprotective studies of malaria that might incorporate imaging to optimize study design.

10771192,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a phosphaturic hormone produced by bone. Hypophosphatemic rickets
disorders, such as X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) and autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets
(ARHR), are associated with FGF23 excess, impaired skeletal growth and osteomalacia leading to debilitating
bone pain and fractures. New therapy consisting in FGF23 antibody injections to increase serum phosphate (Pi)
levels in XLH improves bone growth and mineralization. However, further studies are needed to determine if
this strategy is efficacious in the long term and in other diseases associated with FGF23 excess, including ARHR.
XLH and ARHR type I are respectively caused by inactivating mutations of Pi regulating gene with homologies
to endopeptidase X-linked (PHEX) and dentin matrix protein (DMP1) that work in concert to regulate FGF23
production. In preliminary data for this project, we show that (1) FGF23 excess and hypophosphatemia
contribute to the bone defects in mice with ARHR, (2) excess FGF23 and parathryroid hormone are not solely
responsible for renal Pi wasting, (3) DMP1 directly stimulates Pi reabsorption in the kidney, (4) PHEX and DMP1
are expressed in renal tubular cells where Pi reabsorption occurs, and (5) loss of kidney PHEX induces
phosphaturia and bone loss despite increased DMP1 and low FGF23 levels. The goal of this project is to
investigate the pathogenesis of hypophosphatemia induced by DMP1 deficiency.
In Aim 1, we will define the contribution of FGF23 excess and hypophosphatemia to impaired bone mineralization
in mice with ARHR. We will use normal and high dietary Pi administration, and genetic deletion of Fgf23 in wild-
type (WT) and Dmp1KO to assess modifications of bone and mineral metabolism in mice and cultured primary
osteoblasts over time. In Aim 2, we will establish the role of DMP1 in stimulating Pi reabsorption by antagonizing
FGF23-FGFR1 signaling in the kidney. We will use normal and high dietary Pi administration, and genetic
overexpression of Fgf23 or deletion of Fgfr1, in WT mice and in animals with genetic overexpression of Dmp1
(Dmp1TG). We will assess bone and mineral metabolism, Pi intake and excretion, kidney function and FGFR1
activation in the kidney, in presence of elevated FGF23 and DMP1 levels. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate
the contribution of kidney DMP1 deficiency to the pathophysiology of ARHR and XLH by performing kidney
transplants between Dmp1TG and Dmp1KO and between WT, Hyp and Dmp1TG donor and recipient mice. We
will establish whether kidney-expressed DMP1 is required to fully correct hypophosphatemia in mice with ARHR,
and if loss of kidney PHEX function is sufficient to induce hyperphosphaturia and bone loss despite elevated
DMP1 and low FGF23 levels. This will demonstrate a key functional interaction between PHEX and DMP1 in the
kidney. These innovative aims are supported by a productive collaborative team at Northwestern University that
will further develop our understanding of DMP1, FGF23 and Pi function, and ultimately help to develop novel
therapies to improve outcomes in diseases associated with altered Pi balance."
10931492,"Each year, millions of American adults are hospitalized with suspected sepsis. Current guidelines recommend
prompt administration of antibiotics to reduce mortality among patients who are ultimately diagnosed with
sepsis. However, diagnostic challenges impede safe delivery of rapid antibiotics to appropriate patients. Due to
the high prevalence and significant associated harm of sepsis-related diagnostic errors, sepsis is one of the
`Big Three' conditions prioritized for diagnostic error reduction efforts. Both sepsis under-treatment and over-
treatment have significant population health impact due to misdiagnosis-related harm. However, health
systems currently lack effective, contextually tailored strategies to improving and maintaining diagnostic quality
in sepsis (i.e., correctly identifying patients most likely to benefit from treatment while avoiding adverse
consequences of excessive treatment). The goal of this project is to improve the safety and quality of
early sepsis diagnosis using principles and tools of safety (SaferDx) and implementation sciences
(Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research). We aim to understand which sepsis diagnosis
practices in which contexts are effective, necessary, or complementary for accurate early identification and
treatment of sepsis patients presenting to the ED and develop a toolkit to facilitate translation of this evidence
into practice. We will apply a mixed-methods evaluation approach to accomplish this by successfully
completing the following aims: Characterize and describe variability in i) sepsis diagnosis practices (collected
using stakeholder surveys), ii) contextual conditions that serve as barriers and facilitators to optimal sepsis
diagnosis (captured from stakeholder interviews), and iii) risk-adjusted sepsis diagnosis outcomes (i.e., both
under-treatment and over-treatment, measured using electronic health record data from hospitalizations during
2021-2023) across diverse hospitals (Aim 1); Apply coincidence analysis to identify combinations of sepsis
diagnostic practices and the context in which they occur that are minimally sufficient and necessary for
achieving sepsis diagnostic safety and quality (i.e., high-performance on both under- and over-treatment
outcomes) (Aim 2); and Co-design, disseminate, and evaluate usability of an organizational toolkit to facilitate
optimal sepsis diagnostic practices and evaluate the toolkit's utility using validated implementation outcome
scales (Aim 3). The proposed project is innovative by leveraging the joint concepts of minimizing both under-
and over-treatment in reframing sepsis diagnostic excellence and approaching sepsis diagnosis as a team,
organizational, and institutional process, rather than an individual decision-making process alone. Our
approach will produce an actionable toolkit that is conceptually grounded, informed by rigorous causal
inference methods, and feasible to implement in diverse hospitals and contexts. Results will provide a
sustainable and scalable approach for hospitals to advance diagnostic safety and quality in sepsis and reduce
the immense population health burden of sepsis diagnostic error."
10775776,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Major depressive disorder and other mood disorders are heterogeneous, debilitating illnesses that affect millions
of individuals worldwide. Antidepressants that target the serotonergic system (e.g., SSRIs) remain the most
effective treatment for these disorders and are widely used. However, emerging data show that maternal
antidepressant treatment affects the long-term health and neurodevelopment of offspring through, as yet poorly
understood epigenetic mechanisms. Recent pioneering discoveries from my lab have allowed us to develop the
model organism C. elegans to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which maternal stress, through the
serotonergic system, impacts chromatin in the pre-fertilized oocyte. Notwithstanding the differences between
the C. elegans and mammalian serotonergic systems (5-HT source being neurons, enterochromaffin cells and
maternal placenta in mammals and only neurons in C. elegans), an acute elevation of serotonin levels is a stress
signal in both mammals and C. elegans and acts through conserved receptor-mediated signal transduction
pathways to induce the ancient, conserved transcription factor, HSF1. Our working hypothesis, premised on
preliminary data, is that the stress-induced release of serotonin from maternal neurons in C. elegans enables
HSF1 to recruit chromatin remodeling proteins in a piRNA (21U-RNA)-dependent manner in the germline and
modify chromatin in pre-fertilized oocytes. The result is that threat perception by the mother alters the
development, behavior and physiology of future offspring. In Aim 1, we will identify the neural bases and
signaling mechanisms of the serotonergic defense survival circuit in the parent. In Aim 2, we will identify the
epigenetic changes in pre-fertilized germ cells caused by maternal serotonin, and understand how they impact
offspring neurodevelopment, behavior, and stress resilience."
10746813,"Approximately 84 million Americans have prediabetes, and progression to type 2 diabetes occurs at a rate
of 5% to 10% per year and is a risk factor for heart disease. Although lifestyle change is effective, most
prediabetic individuals cannot achieve the changes necessary to reverse prediabetes or prevent diabetes.
 In recent studies, we treated obese, insulin-resistant humans with the β-adrenergic receptor (β3AR) agonist
mirabegron, and this resulted in improved oral glucose tolerance, lower HbA1c, and increased insulin
sensitivity and β-cell function. These changes occurred in the absence of weight loss. Although brown
adipose tissue did not increase, mirabegron treatment increased beige fat, reduced adipose inflammation and
increased type 1 fibers and capillary density in skeletal muscle. Beige adipocytes have beneficial effects on
glucose metabolism and are postulated to act as a glucose sink.
 Mirabegron stimulates the β3AR which stimulates the cAMP-mediated activation of PKA and the activation
of p38 map kinase, which induces UCP1 and adipose beiging. Recent studies showed that cGMP activation of
protein kinase G (PKG) acted in a similar fashion to improve glucose metabolism and increase white adipose
beiging. Indeed, cGMP is stimulated by natural ligands (ANP, BNP, nitric oxide); the phosphodiesterase 5
(PDE5) inhibitor drugs sildenafil and tadalafil prevent breakdown of cGMP, activating PKG and this results in
increased UCP1 in adipocytes. Therefore, we hypothesize that treatment of prediabetic subjects with
mirabegron or tadalafil will improve glucose metabolism. We further hypothesize that the combined treatment
with mirabegron and tadalafil will have additive improvements in glucose metabolism, likely due to their parallel
actions of stimulating the cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP and inducing adipose beiging.
 Specific Aim 1. We hypothesize that a 4 month treatment with the β3 agonist mirabegron will result in
improved glucose metabolism in obese, prediabetic human research participants, and this improvement in
glucose metabolism will be further improved by combination therapy with mirabegron plus tadalafil.
 Specific Aim 2. We will identify underlying mechanisms of the improved glucose homeostasis in response
to mirabegron and tadalafil by characterizing insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, adipose tissue beiging,
muscle fiber type, and muscle capillaries.
Clinical relevance: Other than weight loss, we have only limited methods for improving prediabetes. Drugs
that target white adipose beiging improve glucose metabolism in both rodents and humans, and we propose
that this can be exploited to attenuate prediabetes. This application addresses the effectiveness of two drugs
that are widely prescribed, well tolerated, but which have not been extensively studied for their metabolic
effectiveness in subjects with prediabetes and have never been studied in combination. Results from this
study could lead to a larger trial which could considerably alter our approach to the treatment of prediabetes."
10746814,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
A maladaptive inflammatory response to lipid imbalance underlies the chronic vascular inflammation in
atherosclerosis. Persistent activation of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) signaling is also observed in both
mouse and human atheroma. ISR is an elaborate, homeostatic signaling activated by a range of conditions such
as hypoxia, hyperlipidemia and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial stress, which are known to
promote atherosclerosis. Small molecules and genetic models that prevent hypercholesterolemia-induced ISR
signaling were shown to prevent atherosclerosis progression, demonstrating ISR’s causality in atherosclerosis
development. Despite regulating lipid-induced sterile inflammation, thereby representing a novel therapeutic
opportunity in cardiovascular disease (CVD), therapeutic targeting of a homeostatic pathway such as ISR in a
chronic disease is not without its challenges. Deciphering the detailed mechanisms by which ISR governs
macrophage immunometabolism and atherogenesis can pave the way to effective and specific therapeutic
strategies in CVD while escaping toxicity that may be associated with targeting homeostatic signaling. We made
the striking discovery that ISR inhibition in hypercholesterolemic mice leads to increased 5-
hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) to 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) ratio in macrophages and plaques while reducing
IL-1b and atherosclerosis progression. The oxidation of 5-mC to 5-hmC is catalyzed by Ten eleven translocation
(TET) family of methylcytosine dioxygenases, somatic mutations in which are associated with coronary heart
disease and early-onset myocardial infarction (MI). The inactivation of TET-2 in mice promotes atherosclerosis
progression and cardiac dysfunction. Our robust preliminary data shows that hypercholesterolemia induces 2-
hydroxyglutarate (2HG), a potent TET inhibitory metabolite, in an ISR-dependent manner. Furthermore,
supplementation with a-ketoglutarate (aKG), a cofactor for TET, stimulates TET activity while inhibiting IL-1b
secretion in mouse and human macrophages. aKG supplementation in a small group of hypercholesterolemic
mice prevented inflammation while reversing TET inhibition. Building on the insight gained through our robust
preliminary studies and incorporating additional evidence from literature, we hypothesize that hyperlipidemia-
induced ISR signaling generates an immunometabolite that can promote macrophage inflammatory
response and atherosclerosis. We propose to investigate ATF4’s role in regulating macrophage
immunometabolism and promoting atherosclerosis in vivo. We will also investigate the consequences of
modulating 2HG levels in myeloid cells on inflammation and atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic mice. The
completion of the proposed studies will illuminate the metabolic and epigenetic consequences for ISR signaling
in macrophages on sterile inflammation and atherosclerosis development. The new knowledge gained through
these studies could pave the way for the development of effective and specific therapeutic strategies to
antagonize ISR signaling components that promote sterile inflammation and drive atherosclerosis progression."
10771976,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive degenerative disorder of unclear etiology and disease-modifying
treatments remain elusive. However, there are abnormalities in substrate delivery to the brain, altered capillary
reactivity, neurovascular coupling, and hemodynamic responsiveness to metabolic stress, such as low glucose
or spreading depression, in both the disease and animal models (CVN-AD). Our hypothesis is that
transcranial alternating current electrical stimulation (tACS) can improve metabolic insufficiency in a
dose dependent and dynamic manner in the CVN-AD animal model of Alzheimer's disease, modulating
disease progression and degeneration.
We will apply tACS through skull mounted electrodes first on a scheduled approach, comparing 10 and 40 Hz
stimulation to enhance cerebral blood flow and improve substrate delivery to the brain, assisted by Dr.'s
Peterchev and Schmidt. Further, we will test behavioral outcomes to assess the effects of chronic, scheduled
tACS and sham tACS over 4 weeks, starting at the critical points of degeneration at 12 and 24 weeks of age in
the CVN-AD model, assessing outcome with probe trial errors on a Barnes maze, cerebral blood flow,
measures of neurodegeneration. As a second goal we will develop dynamic, metabolic need-based tACS,
using closed loop approaches. Surrogate physiological markers will include electrical recordings, glucose
recordings, and EEG signals of activity to augment blood flow in a dynamic manner to improve immediate
metabolic substrate supply and reduce degeneration.
These experiments will establish the feasibility and parameters to translate into initial human studies
using either semi-permanent skull mounted or temporary skin electrodes. Since current density and
intracranial penetration of tACS is limited in humans various translational strategies will be devised to
include dynamic biomarkers and appropriate stimulation levels through subcutaneous electrodes."

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is an aggressive malignancy where surgical resection is the most effective curative
option. Reliance on bright light visualization and tactile cues limit the efficiency of surgical resection for PC and
its premalignant precursor lesions and contribute to unfavorable outcomes. Intraoperative fluorescence guidance
improves both stagings as well as the accuracy of oncologic surgeries and results in lower local recurrence rates
and improved survival. The success of fluorescence-guided imaging is dependent on the sensitivity and
specificity of a marker being utilized for detecting PC and its precursor lesions. Multiple studies from our
laboratory and others have established the differential expression of MUC4 in pancreatic pathologies. While it is
undetectable in the normal pancreas, de novo overexpression of MUC4 is restricted to high-risk-precursor
lesions and invasive PC and its expression increases progressively disease advancement. An in-house
generated monoclonal antibody (mAb) against MUC4, 8G7, which recognizes repetitive epitopes in the tandem
repeat domain, has emerged as a useful tool for ultrasensitive detection and defining the role of MUC4 in tumor
progression and metastasis. High MUC4 expression in PC is associated with poor survival, while in precursor
lesions, MUC4 expression is a predictor of malignant risk. Our preliminary studies indicate that systemically
administered mAb 8G7 labeled with NIRF dye IRDye800CW can very sensitively illuminate MUC4-expressing
subcutaneous and orthotopic tumors in vivo. Further, we have developed a unique animal model that
recapitulates MUC4-driven IPMN-to-invasive PC progression. In this model, pancreas-specific inducible
expression of human MUC4 in conjunction with oncogenic KrasG12D results in the development of premalignant
IPMN and PanIN lesions that progress to invasive PC. The proposal seeks to develop and evaluate MUC4-
targeted NIR probes for optical surgical navigation of PC and its premalignant precursor lesions in the preclinical
models. We hypothesize that intraoperative use of MUC4-targeted Near-Infrared Fluorescent (NIRF)
imaging probes will improve the resection of PC and its high-risk precursor lesions. To test this
hypothesis, two specific aims are proposed. Studies in Aim 1 focus on the synthesis, characterization, and (pre)
clinical safety profiling of MUC4-targeted near-infrared fluorescent conjugates. Aim 2 studies evaluate the
preclinical efficacy of MUC4-targeted imaging probes in patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models,
human MUC4 transgenic GEM models, and clinical specimens. Overall, the development of targeted imaging
probes can improve both the detection and margin-free resection of precursor lesions and PC. The studies
proposed in this application will develop and test high-performance NIR probes targeting MUC4 (a top
differentially overexpressed membrane mucin in PC) for surgical navigation in PC and its precursor lesions.
Successful accomplishment of study goals will pave the path for a Phase I clinical trial for urgently needed
imaging probes for improved detection and surgical resection of PC and its high-risk precursor lesions."

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are important therapeutic agents to treat various cancers. However, any
agent has a tradeoff between efficacy and on or off target deleterious effects. This notion became evident in
the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) when a potent and broadly inhibitory tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, ponatinib (Iclusig, Ariad Pharmaceuticals, now Takeda) was recognized to have a 31% incidence of
cardiovascular (CV) events of which 21% overall were significant adverse events (SAEs). In a Phase II trial
(PACE) at 4 yrs. the incidence of arterial occlusive events was 26% (myocardial infarction 14%, stroke 11%,
and limb ischemia 11% - some patients have more than 1 organ event). Ponatinib (poni) is one of 5 TKIs
approved for the treatment of CML
We have created a murine model to examine the effects of TKIs on blood coagulation, vascular, and platelet
function. In aged mice treated with the various TKIs under steady-state conditions, ponatinib, unlike imatinib,
demonstrated an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis. Poni treatment leads to decreased arterial
occlusion times, larger venous clots and generates hyperactive platelets - features that contribute to
heightened thrombosis. Our laboratory has identified key mechanisms underlying the prothrombotic
phenotype of poni. First, poni-treated mice have increased vessel wall reactive oxygen species (ROS),
apoptosis, and inflammatory vascular lymphocyte infiltrates that expresses coagulation factors V and VIII.
Second, platelets from poni-treated mice are hyperactive to in response to collagen. Additionally, we have
determined that pioglitazone (pio), a PPAR agonist, when given with poni normalizes the vessel wall
inflammation and platelet hyperactivity to correct murine thrombosis risk
The overall hypothesis of this application is that poni-associated thrombosis results from immune cell vascular
inflammation expressing prothrombotic genes and altered platelet signaling resulting in platelet hyperreactivity.
Poni treatment has identified a novel mechanism of prothrombotic vascular dysfunction by which vascular
infiltrating lymphocytes express coagulation enzymes FV and FVIII potentially to contribute to thrombosis. At
therapeutic dosing in man, poni inhibits p-LynY507, a negative regulator of activated GPVI, in both unstimulated
and activated platelets with little effect on p-LynY396 and p-SykY352, suggesting that these platelets may be
more reactive. In fact, poni-treated mice have platelets that react to lower concentrations of CRP. These
defects are genetically and functionally corrected by pio’s genomic and non-genomic PPAR agonism. The
specific aims of the proposal are as follows:
The specific aims of the proposal are as follows: 1) Determine the mechanism of ponatinib- and other TKI-
induced vascular inflammation 2) Identify the mechanisms of poni-induced platelet hyperactivation.
These studies will determine the mechanisms of poni and other TKI effects on vessel wall and platelets that
lead to cardiovascular events. They present a pre-clinical model for poni-associated thrombosis and correction
with pio, a PPAR agonist. Last, they will serve as a paradigm for CVD assessment for TKIs in general."
10772023,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
California is the most populous state in the nation but, in contrast to the racial and ethnic diversity of the
Californian population, the research workforce in the biological science is relatively homogeneous. One of
the reasons lies in the limited number of underrepresented minority (URM) students who enter PhD
programs. To address this issue, a Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) will be
developed at UC Berkeley to provide URM and disabled students, who want to pursue a career in
biomedical research, with the intensive research experience and academic enrichment necessary to
prepare them successfully for graduate school application and their subsequent careers in academia. The
goals of this application are three-fold: (1) P rovide exceptional research opportunities to underrepresented
recent college graduates; (2) Establish strong mentoring relationships and community building through a
mentoring system providing the trainees with the support network they need to flourish in the program and
beyond; and (3) Provide state of the art professional development tools and coaching to support scholars’
development and optimally prepare them to succeed in a biomedical research career. Annual support is
sought for 6 “post-bac” students who will be placed in productive research laboratories which are actively
funded by federal grants. Throughout the year long program, scholars will participate in enrichment
activities including: writing personal statements for graduate applications; mock interviews; assistance in
completing graduate applications; GRE Preparation; travel to scientific meetings; and improvement of
communication skills.
To achieve the success of this program, the Program Directors Prof. Gian Garriga, Associate Dean of
Equity and Inclusion in the Biological Sciences, and Dr. Schaletzky, Executive Director of the Center of
Emerging and Neglected Diseases (CEND) at UC Berkeley have recruited 38 faculty members to provide,
not only intensive laboratory research training, but also relevant professional development guidance. An
asset for the program, CEND is known within UC Berkeley for excellence in administration and a
commitment to enhancing participation of underrepresented groups in STEM. CEND will bring excellent
management and leadership and individual mentoring to the program and also provide a comprehensive
career development program, involving individual development plans supported by a variety of career
development workshops tailored to participating scholars. We are confident that scholars graduating from
this program will be in an excellent position to successfully compete for graduate schools, contributing to
equal representation of all groups in STEM and strengthening the innovation capacity of the scientific
community in a sustainable fashion."

Host-adapted strains of Salmonella enterica cause systemic infections and have the ability to persist systemically
within granulomas for long periods of time. Persistently infected hosts are often asymptomatic and transmit
disease to naïve hosts, thereby serving as a critical reservoir for disease. From the bacterial perspective,
persistent infection is essential for microbial survival in nature. However, very little is known about the molecular
mechanisms involved in persistent Salmonella infections and transmission between mammalian hosts.
Increased knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of Salmonella persistence may lead to the ability to eradicate
the Salmonella carrier state pharmacologically. Our long-term goal is to understand how Salmonella
persists within tissues of mammalian hosts for preventive and therapeutic purposes. The objective of this
proposal, which is our next step in pursuit of this goal, is to identify host pathways involved in granuloma
dynamics and to determine how Salmonella manipulates host cells for long-term survival. The premise that will
be tested in this application is that Salmonella injects virulence factors into granuloma macrophages that both
promote an anti-inflammatory state and block specific proinflammatory responses in order to persist in
mammalian hosts. We propose to study the molecular mechanisms of persistent Salmonella infections in
granulomas of mammalian hosts. Aim 1 will characterize the cellular organization and molecular regulation of
granulomas during persistent Salmonella mouse infection, with a particular focus on visualization and analysis
of gene expression of granuloma macrophages in tissue sections by spatial transcriptomics. In Aim 2, we will
identify mechanisms of Salmonella-dependent manipulation of granuloma macrophages. Aim 3 will characterize
the role of the Type 6 secretion system during persistent Salmonella infection. The proposed research is
innovative because we investigate the spatial transcriptomics of granuloma macrophages, a heretofore-
unexamined pathogen niche. Insight into host-pathogen interactions during persistent infection of a mammalian
host is impactful as novel biomarkers and treatments of asymptomatic carriers are needed for eradication of this
disease reservoir."
10770233,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The sense of olfaction allows animals to gather critical information about resources, dangers, and potential social
interactions. A primary goal of olfactory neuroscience is to understand how neural circuit operations in the main
olfactory system parse chemical signals in the environment and contribute to adaptive behavior. Neural circuits
in piriform cortex (PCx), the primary olfactory cortex, are thought to transform elemental odor information
received from the olfactory bulb into more holistic ‘odor object’ representations that signal the presence of unique
odor sources in the environment. The olfactory system developed this ability over the course of evolution in
contexts where information about the presence and identity of other animals, especially conspecifics, was
critically important. Substantial progress has been made in understanding representations of neutral
monomolecular odorants in PCx. By contrast, nothing is known about olfactory cortical processing of social
scents. In support of a specialized role in social odor processing, PCx densely expresses receptors for the
neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) involved in a wide range of social behaviors. However, the potential for OT
modulation also suggests that PCx circuits may operate differently in social and nonsocial contexts. The objective
of this proposal is to understand how cortical odor processing contributes to social behavior. The central
hypothesis is that OT modulates PCx circuit dynamics in social contexts to allow distinct conspecific identity
coding and support social recognition. The approach is to use calcium imaging and multi-electrode recordings
to observe PCx population responses during social odor processing and to use targeted perturbations of PCx
function to test its role in social behavior. The rationale is that observing and perturbing the system as it performs
its natural role in an adaptive behavior provides the most accurate picture of PCx’s capabilities and contribution
to fitness. The following aims address these goals: Aim 1: Determine how social recognition information is
encoded in piriform cortex. We will image large populations of PCx neurons in freely interacting animals and
compare dynamics and coding properties during social or nonsocial stimulus investigation to test our hypothesis
that distinct circuit dynamics in social contexts enable reliable discrimination of individual social identity. Aim 2:
Determine how oxytocin modulates social odor processing in piriform cortex. We will first measure
dynamics of OT neuron activity during social interactions using fiber photometry, and then match these dynamics
with optogenetic stimulation of OT neurons while recording PCx population responses to controlled presentation
of social odors. Aim 3: Determine the role of piriform cortex in individualized social behavior. PCx function
will be perturbed by chemogenetic inactivation or by deletion of OT receptors to test whether cortical processing
and modulation are required for social interactions that depend on identifying individual social partners in
pairwise and group settings. This work will provide fundamental insights into how the olfactory system contributes
to adaptive behavior in natural contexts."

Granulomas form as a conserved host response to a variety of inflammatory and infectious stimuli. As
granulomas assemble, macrophages interdigitate and undergo a striking morphological transition, taking on an
epithelioid appearance. The basis for this transformation and the consequences to disease are not well
understood. We identified a conserved reprogramming of macrophages that underlies the assembly and
stability of mycobacterial granulomas. Using a zebrafish model, we find that broad epithelial modules and
structures are induced during tuberculous granuloma formation and are critical for granuloma integrity. In this
project we will 1) assess how specific Type 2 immune signals interact with countervailing Type 1 signals to
coordinate epithelioid transformation and granuloma assembly; 2) test the role of the EMP2/Focal Adhesion
Kinase (FAK) pathway in granuloma stability, disaggregation and the dissemination of infection; 3) based on
scRNA-seq analysis of granulomas as well as macrophages isolated from individual animals, assess the role
of JAG1-Notch in granuloma formation, maintenance, and infection trajectory. We will extend findings from
these studies into analysis of human disease. Overall, this proposal will test the hypothesis that, in a striking
parallel to mesenchymal-to-epithelial transitions in development and cancer, macrophages draw on classical
developmental signaling pathways to undergo an epithelial-like transition. This reprogramming underlies the
central structure of tuberculosis and defines interactions with the host immune system. We will test how
perturbations of these pathways lead to alterations in disease progression and outcome. A new perspective on
this critical structure may have important implications for our understanding of disease progression and
provides opportunities for new therapeutic approaches."

Hearing-related disorders have a profound impact on the individuals’ social-emotional-cognitive well-being and
overall quality of life across the lifespan. Audiologists are health care professionals that are a part of the
biomedical workforce who provide patient-centric care related to screening, assessing, and treating individuals
with hearing and other related impairments, with the Doctor of Audiology (AuD) being the entry-level professional
degree for an audiologist. AuD programs focus on training next-generation audiologists in clinical education
focused on evidence-based approaches to hearing healthcare. Yet, there is a need to train clinicians as scientists
to better understand the mechanistic bases of listening in complex environments and drive the next generation
of interventional and therapeutic approaches. TRANSLATES: TRanslational Auditory NeuroScience: LAb-based
Training for Empowered Self-efficacy in audiology doctoral students, aims to bridge this gap by providing 25 AuD
students (5 per cohort over 5 years) at the University of Pittsburgh with hands-on, individualized, immersive
research experiences in National Institutes of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)-funded
research labs. TRANSLATES aims to improve research self-efficacy (RSE) - self-belief in the ability to conduct
high-quality research, provide research experiences in NIDCD-funded labs to increase competitiveness in the
biomedical research workforce, and increase the number of underrepresented minorities in AuD and in
biomedical research careers. Participants will engage in a mentor-scaffolded summer research bootcamp
(Accelerated-Behavioral Learning Experience, or ABLE) that includes a self-contained research project,
additional didactic training on key domains contributing to RSE and a two-day symposium that provides
opportunities to interact with role-models such as invited clinician-scientists from diverse backgrounds and
previous cohorts. RSE measures will be collected before and after ABLE and an individual development plan
will be implemented based on the strengths/weaknesses identified by the self-efficacy measures. After
completing ABLE, each student will be matched with a program faculty member, and conduct immersive, hands-
on, research projects in NIDCD-funded research labs over two semesters culminating in a department-wide
poster presentation, along with data dissemination through national and international conferences and peer
reviewed publications. Participants will receive stipend and tuition support to remove barriers to entry into
biomedical research. TRANSLATES participants, program, and mentors will be continuously monitored for
quality using standardized measures and feedback from a Stakeholder Advisory Panel. The long-term objective
of TRANSLATES is to increase the representation of AuDs in the clinician scientist biomedical workforce,
increase the number of underrepresented minorities in a field that is strikingly homogenous despite known
health-related disparities in hearing healthcare, and contribute to the training of personnel who are well-poised
to bring their disciplinary knowledge and skills to multi-disciplinary biomedical research teams."

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most common bacterial infections and are caused predominantly by
uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). While broad-spectrum antimicrobials have been the drug of choice to
treat UTIs, the emergence of antimicrobial drug resistance and related recurrent UTI suggests that this is not an
effective approach to treat all UTIs. Hence, further understanding of the intrinsic host defense mechanisms
during bladder and kidney infection should provide new targets for selective, antimicrobial-sparing therapeutic
approaches.
There is growing evidence that mucin 1 (MUC1) is a crucial element in the host defense against infection. MUC1
is a heterodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells in
several tissues including the bladder and kidney. The two subunits remain non-covalently associated but the
larger mucin-like subunit is cleaved and shed into the lumen, while the cytoplasmic domain of the smaller subunit
is involved in signal transduction through interactions with numerous kinases and transactivation of transcription
factors after trafficking to the nucleus. It is well established that MUC1 protects the gastrointestinal and
respiratory tracts by acting as a decoy receptor for bacterial adhesins, thereby limiting infection and colonization,
and more importantly plays a significant role as a modulator of pathogen-induced inflammation. However, the
role of MUC1 in host response and cellular signaling during UTI has not been investigated. We hypothesize that
MUC1, a transmembrane glycoprotein, plays a central role during UTI by acting as a host receptor for bacterial
pathogens and modulating host responses to microbial infection. Using purified MUC1, cultured cells with
different MUC1 expression levels and MUC1 glycosylation patterns, and newly generated bladder- and kidney-
specific KO mice (Uroth-Muc1-/- and Kd-Muc1-/-, respectively) global Muc1-/- mice and littermate controls in our
murine model of experimental UTI with different bacterial strains, we will (i) characterize UPEC binding to MUC1
and determine whether MUC1 ECD acts as a cellular receptor (uroplakin model) or rather like a decoy receptor
(uromodulin model) for UPEC, (ii) verify whether UPEC interactions with MUC1 result in the enhancement or the
suppression of bacterial infection, (iii) determine UT epithelial cells demonstrate MUC1 dependent responses to
UPEC challenge, and finally (iv) assess MUC1-mediated host signaling and transcriptional activities while
dissecting the role of the two MUC1 domains (ECD vs CD) upon UPEC challenge.
This a new direction in my research focus from the role of MUC1 in ischemic injury in the kidney to urinary tract
host defense against bacterial infection will provide crucial insights into UTI pathogenesis and will identify novel
alternative targets to treat UTI and prevent its recurrence."

Migrant and seasonal farmworkers (MSFWs) are predominantly Hispanic and continue to face serious health
inequity and disparity in the United States. They are at high risk of developing acute and chronic diseases that
can be caused by two top hazards at work: extreme heat and pesticides.
underlying health conditions that may develop into chronic kidney disease (CKD) while pesticides exposure
can lead to acute or chronic poisoning. The combination of heat and pesticides could exacerbate
health conditions for farmworkers. Moreover, farmworkers have limited access to regular healthcare due to
physical, economic, infrastructural, knowledge, and culture barriers, with the result being that sick farmworkers
cannot get diagnosed and treated in a timely manner. All these may contribute to the short life expectancy
(average of 49-years) of farmworkers. Thus, early detection and timely intervention is critical for farm workers
to reduce the risk of developing various diseases caused by heat and pesticides.
Extreme heat exposure can cause
underlying
Existing diagnostic assays for
the detection of CKD and pesticides poisoning such as calorimetric creatinine assays and Ellman assays for
measuring blood acetylcholinesterase (AChE) are generally performed in centralized laboratories, are
expensive, and have a long turnaround time. Thus, there is a critical need to develop new point-of-care (POC)
technologies and new approaches for farmworkers to overcome these barriers to get healthcare and health
literacy and improve their quality of life. We have developed and validated an integrated
smartphone/nanosensor device for onsite rapid and sensitive detection of personal exposure to pesticides
using minimally-invasive finger stick blood, which was supported by an NIH NIEHS STTR grant
(R41ES032388). In this proposal, we will expand this technology and develop a smartphone-based multiplex
nanosensing platform and a health education app for farmworkers. The multiplex nanosensing platform can be
applied for early and fast screening of pesticide exposure and kidney diseases using a tiny finger-stick blood
for farmworkers. The health education app can be used by farmworkers to learn heat and pesticides-related
health information. The long-term goal of this research is to reduce farmworker health disparity and improve
farmworker health through providing farmworkers with inexpensive, efficient, and new mobile health technology
for rapid home screening, point-of-care (POC) testing, and health education. We will have four aims. In aim 1,
we will develop nanosensors for measuring creatinine and acetylcholinesterase activity; In aim 2, we will
develop a multiplexing resistance meter with Bluetooth and evaluate the analytical performance of the
multiplex nanosensing platform for simultaneously measuring creatinine and AChE using spiked blood
samples; In aim 3, we will develop an app for the multiplex nanosensing platform and a health education app
and associated cloud for farmworkers; Finally, we will validate the multiplex nanosensing platform and health
education app with farmworkers through the collaboration with Farmworker Association of Florida with a
ultimate goal of reducing heat and pesticides-induced farmworker health disparity. The combination of this new
technology and community-based participatory research on the heat and pesticide exposure with farmworkers
provides a feasible approach to engage this vulnerable population in the health disparity research. This project
is significant and innovative because it will provide a new approach and cost-effective and efficient technology
for farmworker to address the high health risks posed from heat and pesticides and prevent farmworkers from
developing diseases, thus reducing farmworker health disparity."

Rejection remains a major hurdle to long-term transplant survival, in which Teff cells are prominently
involved. We surmise that besides signals from the TCR, costimulatory and cytokine receptors, targeting the
“T cell epigenome” downstream of T cell activation may represent novel therapeutic opportunities in the
induction of transplant tolerance. Now we have new preliminary data showing that the chromatin in Teff
cells are highly compartmentalized, in that “super enhancers” at accessible chromatin regions appear to
control a Teff cell fate by recruiting a chromatin reader called BRD4. We then developed a Brd4-floxed mice
and showed that conditional deletion of Brd4 in T cells completely abrogated the lethal autoimmune
phenotype in Scurfy mice and produced long-term allograft survival in Brd4f/fCd4-Cre mice. Thus, dissecting
mechanistically how BRD4 epigenetically regulates Teff cells and transplant survival is the central goal of
this proposal. Our working hypothesis is that BRD4 occupancy at the accessible chromatin regions locks
active chromatin modules in an accessible state or triggers reorganization of “super enhancers” into
transcriptionally hyper-active “hotspots” to drive a Teff cell fate. We proposed 3 Aims in this proposal to test
this hypothesis. Aim 1 is to determine whether BRD4 locks “active” chromatin modules in an accessible
state, allowing the formation of 3D chromatin configurations to specify a Teff cell fate, and Aim 2 is to
examine whether BRD4 enables stable SE “hotspots”, allowing Teff cells to establish essential features of
Teff profiles. Aim 3 is to test whether therapeutically targeting BRD4 enables long-term allograft survival in
a heart transplant model. We believe that the proposed studies will uncover new insights and open new
therapeutic opportunities in transplantation. The animal models, tools, and cutting-edge technologies we
have developed in the lab put us in a unique position to carry out the proposed studies."

Hemophilia A is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by hereditary defects in the F8 gene (encoding coagulation
factor VIII, FVIII), which affects approximately 1 in 5000 male births worldwide. Clinically, hemophilia A is
manifested as a severe bleeding phenotype that typically requires costly protein replacement therapy. The recent
development of a gene therapy holds the promise of curing hemophilia A. Although the outcome of clinical trials
using AAV vectors for hemophilia A has been encouraging, Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated delivery of
FVIII has not yet received regulatory approval. Major hurdles persist since there are concerns on gradually
decreasing levels of FVIII in circulation as well as clonal hepatocellular expansion in long-term studies in a canine
model, which raises concerns over genotoxicity or even cancer formation when using AAV vectors for human
gene therapy. Current AAV-FVIII gene delivery strategies (AAV-F8) follow a standard design, in which a mini-
promoter is used to drive F8 expression with two flanking ITRs. Nevertheless, clinical-grade vectors produced
were reasonably homogenous based on Southern blot analysis of vector genomes. Our new studies however,
using single molecule sequencing (SMRT), have uncovered a broad complexity of vector population that has
been missed using conventional methods of analysis. One notable subgenomic vector particle contains the
snapback genome (SBG), which may lead to dsRNA production in the host cells. For other SBGs having only
the promoter sequences, they run the risk of promoting oncogenic readthrough, which may be a substantial
safety concern. The central hypothesis of this project is that the combination of trans factors such as host cellular
proteins, viral helper functions and cis elements such as vector nucleotide compositions lead to SGP formation.
Therefore, a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how these factors mediate SGP formation will be
essential for the development of new a vector production platform with reduced/eliminated SGP particles and for
the design of strategies to control and manage the potential hazards of SGP. To achieve these goals, we will
pursue the following aims: 1): To define the roles of trans factors in subgenomic particle formation; 2) to define
the role of vector genome composition in subgenomic particle formation; and 3) to develop strategies to
reduce/eliminate subgenomic particle formation."

Hepatic in vivo gene transfer with adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors for treatment of the X-linked bleeding
disorder hemophilia has advanced to multiple Phase I/II and 4 Phase III clinical trials, all seeking to stably restore
hemostasis through long-term expression in hepatocytes. As opposed to other treatment modalities, gene
therapy has the potential to cure the disease, thus eliminating the need for frequent injections of coagulation
factors or other medicines. However, it has been a major challenge to accomplish sustained correction of
hemophilia A (deficiency in coagulation factor VIIII, FVIII, representing ~80% of hemophilic patients). FVIII is
difficult to express at high levels. Hence, high vector doses are required. Nonetheless, FVIII activity in the normal
to super-physiological range was achieved in clinical trial. While this result was widely celebrated in 2017, it has
since become clear that FVIII expression at these high levels is not stable. A gradual decline in all patients was
observed in years 2-4, down to the lower end of the therapeutic range, raising serious concerns about durability.
Other studies begin to show similar outcome, whereas lower FVIII levels, resulting from more modest vector
doses, appear to be sustained. Hepatotoxicity and treatment with steroids were typical features during the first
year of high-dose gene transfer. There is now a growing realization that basic science studies are paramount to
achieve safety and efficacy. Our preliminary data strongly support the hypothesis that the closely interlinked
cellular stress and innate immune responses to FVIII and the vector (which are substantially impacted by vector
design) limit stability of therapeutic expression and also drive adaptive immunity. It is well established that
expression of FVIII at high levels results in the accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER, cellular stress and
toxicity, aggregation, und induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Our data show that hepatic AAV
gene transfer, while having the potential to induce immune tolerance to transgene products, also activates innate
immune pathways and cytokine responses that can lead to cellular immune responses. AAV vectors introduce
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Cellular stress and innate immunity are interlinked, and
damage-associated molecular patters (DAMPs) drive immunity. In fact, we see gradual loss of FVIII expression
in a hemophilia A mouse models despite a lack of antibody formation. This project specifically proposes to: i)
Define the mechanisms by which “subgenomic particles” cause innate and adaptive immune responses to AAV-
FVIII in primary human hepatocytes/innate immune cells and in murine models; ii) define immune response
mechanisms against FVIII in hepatic AAV gene transfer as a function of vector and transgene design; and iii)
define the mechanisms that lead to gradual loss of FVIII expression and develop protocols for sustained therapy
and immune tolerance."

The goals of this research program are to understand how bromodomain ‘reading’ of the epigenetic histone
language is regulated by metabolism (Direction 1) and disease-associated missense variants (Direction 2). Our
approach is multidisciplinary, focusing on mechanisms and developing novel chemical tools as starting points
for drug development (Direction 3). Bromodomains bind acyl-lysines on histones and other nuclear proteins to
modulate transcription. The importance of bromodomain-mediated transcription in human disease is well-
established. Bromodomain inhibitors are in clinical trials for multiple indications, including cardiovascular
disease and cancer. Despite these achievements, several critical questions remain. For example, histone and
transcription factor lysine residues are modified by an array of non-acetyl acylations. These acylations are
derived from acyl-CoA metabolites, indicating an intricate interplay between the cellular energy states that
modulate acyl-CoA levels and bromodomain-mediated transcriptional regulation. Where, when, and how these
acylations recruit bromodomains to chromatin for transcriptional regulation is poorly understood. Therefore, we
are testing the hypothesis that changes in metabolic flux induce distinct histone acylations that are ‘read’ by
specific bromodomains to regulate transcription and inflammation (Direction 1). Bromodomains are also hot
spots for cancer-associated missense variants. However, the impacts of these variants on bromodomain-
mediated transcriptional regulation are largely unknown. Elucidating the mechanisms through which
bromodomain missense variants transcriptionally regulate key cancer signaling pathways will spur the
development of novel precision medicine therapeutic approaches. Accordingly, we are testing the hypothesis
that bromodomain missense variants with disrupted stability, structure, and dynamics attenuate bromodomain-
mediated transcriptional regulation of key cancer signaling pathways (Direction 2). Here, we employ the
integrated computational and biophysical pipeline that we developed in the Medical College of Wisconsin
Structural Genomics Unit to interrogate disease-associated missense variants from protein structure to
integrative transcriptomics. Another critical barrier to progress in bromodomain biology is the lack of inhibitors
and chemical probes specifically targeting individual bromodomains. We are overcoming this barrier by
developing selective bromodomain inhibitors using a novel fragment NMR screening pipeline we pioneered in
the Medical College of Wisconsin Program in Chemical Biology (Direction 3). In line with the NIGMS mission to
increase understanding of biological processes and advance knowledge of disease, our mechanistic inquiries
into bromodomain-mediated transcriptional regulation, coupled with our development of inhibitors and chemical
probes, will distinguish the differential activities of bromodomains in cell and animal models of health and
disease. Additionally, our research will identify valuable starting points to develop therapeutics targeting the
bromodomain transcriptional regulatory axis in an array of human inflammatory diseases."

Gene therapy for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is currently being tested in clinical trials in young
patients. However, limitations of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery system, including its small carrying
capacity and its low efficiency transfection of muscle stem cells, will remain a barrier to a cure. The
miniaturized transgene being delivered that is based on a Becker muscular dystrophy dystrophin (micro-
dystrophin) will still result in some skeletal muscle turnover with subsequent inflammation and cardiomyopathy.
Additionally, injury resulting from normal muscle use will be repaired with muscle stem cells that will likely not
express dystrophin. Both of these issues will result in at least low-level chronic inflammation, which will likely
exacerbate muscle damage and ultimate loss of transgene expression, limiting efficacy. Prednisone, which has
served as the standard of care for DMD, but has many severe side effects, continues to be given as an anti-
inflammatory to prevent an immune response to the transgene. Published and preliminary data support the
scientific premise that mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists, which have clinical benefit for DMD
cardiomyopathy, stabilize muscle membranes, improve skeletal muscle force, and reduce fibrosis, are also
anti-inflammatory and represent an ideal drug for combination with gene transfer. However, the anti-
inflammatory properties of MR antagonists in muscular dystrophy have not been explored. Since prednisone
directly competes with MR antagonist binding to its receptors, these studies are crucial for clinical use of MR
antagonists as an adjunct therapy to replace prednisone. In this application, we will test whether prednisone
and MR antagonists have the same or different effects on specific immune cell populations in dystrophic
muscles, whether cytokine reductions by MR antagonists are dependent on MR signaling mechanisms in
muscle fibers or myeloid cells, and whether MR antagonists limit accumulated damage after acute injury in
dystrophic mice treated with micro-dystrophin gene therapy. We have developed methods to flow sort immune
cell populations from single muscles from the mdx genotypic model of DMD that will allow the first identification
of the immune cell populations suppressed by prednisone, despite decades of clinical use, and a direct
comparison with MR antagonists. These methods will also allow for the unbiased identification of gene
expression changes in inflammatory myeloid cells induced by MR antagonists and prednisone. These studies
will inform optimal MR antagonist clinical use as a co-therapy to extend efficacy of emerging genetic therapies
for DMD and potentially other forms of muscular dystrophies. The data generated will also identify novel
potential anti-inflammatory treatment targets."
10766196,"Project Summary / Abstract
Cisplatin is a potent antitumor drug used in ~40% of cancer chemotherapy regimens together with
other platinum-based drugs. Unfortunately, cisplatin also induces multiple unwanted toxic effects
such as ototoxicity, which contributes to ~100-300 thousand new hearing impairment cases
annually among the cancer patients in the US alone. Cisplatin-induced hearing loss (CIHL) is
related to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing cochlear damage, particularly
the loss of outer hair cells (OHCs). In this regard, antioxidants working as free radical scavengers
are proposed for treating CIHL). However, antioxidants generate lots of issues such as
deactivating cisplatin and protecting tumor cells. To date, no effective clinical treatment for CIHL
has been approved. Different to the antioxidants, honokiol (HNK) is a multifunctional molecule
that can both protect normal cells from oxidative damage and potentiate the antitumor effect of
cisplatin. The protective effects of HNK against CIHL is verified in our recent publication. The
mechanism is associated with the activation of sirtuins, the critical regulators of the anti-ROS
system in the cells. The sirtuin family is composed of 7 members of deacetylase, expressing in
different intracellular locations including cytoplasm (SIRT1, 2), mitochondria (SIRT3-5), and
nucleus (SIRT1, 2, 6, 7) and forming an intrinsic network for ROS detoxification.
In this study, the roles of the sirtuin family in the protective effects of HNK against CIHL will be
further investigated. First, the hearing protective effects of HNK against CIHL and the activation
of sirtuins will be further verified in a tumor bearing mouse model undergoing chemotherapy.
Second, the significance of cytosolic sirtuins (SIRT1) will be verified in a SIRT1 deficiency model.
Third, the role of mitochondria sirtuins (SIRT3 and SIRT5) and their potential compensation to
each other will be verified using SIRT3 knockout mice and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 knockout
mice. Auditory brainstem response and distortion product otoacoustic emission will be measured
to assess hearing function. X-ray fluorescence microscopy will be used to verify the distribution
of platinum in the inner ear. Immunostaining, confocal imaging, and X-ray micro-computed
tomography will be applied for studying morphological changes such as OHC loss. A more
comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of the CIHL and its protection will be obtained.
This project is of great clinical significance by laying the groundwork for human tests using HNK
for hearing protection in chemotherapy. Furthermore, the proposed study will also provide insight
into hearing protection against other types of hearing impairment, such as noise-induced, drug-
induced and age-related hearing loss."

Helicobacter pylori is the strongest risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma, the fourth leading cause of cancer-
related death. One H. pylori determinant that increases gastric cancer risk is the cag type IV secretion system
(T4SS) which exports a bacterial oncoprotein, CagA, into host cells. Our entire group has collaboratively shown
that cag+ strains selectively activate a gastric stem cell population marked by Lrig1, as well as the EGF receptor,
ornithine decarboxylase, and spermine oxidase, host effectors that influence carcinogenesis. Project 2, Core A,
and Core B have additionally made the discovery that a pathway contributing to gastric carcinogenesis involves
reactive electrophiles and developed a novel intervention strategy using a clinically available electrophile
scavenger. Projects 1 and 3 demonstrated with Cores A and B that environmental components of the
exposome associated with gastric cancer, such as iron deficiency or a high salt diet, positively select for H. pylori
variants linked to increased cancer risk and augment the ability of cag+ strains to induce disease. Finally, all
Projects used unbiased approaches (Core B) to identify novel host effectors that increase cancer risk, including
bile acids. Our overarching Hypothesis is that differences in infecting strains, host responses, and environmental
exposures such as diet affect the risk of developing gastric cancer as a consequence of H. pylori infection. To
address this, our PPG integrates studies of host-pathogen interactions and oncogenic signaling initiated by
biomedical researchers who have made a strong commitment to research within the fields of carcinogenesis,
immunobiology, gastroenterology, and microbiology, and will generate results that would not be attainable
through independent investigation. The Projects below are driven by discrete hypotheses, yet are cohesive in
their focus on H. pylori-host interactions that induce cellular responses with carcinogenic potential.
Project 1. Effect of iron deprivation on H. pylori-induced gastric carcinogenesis (PI-Richard Peek)
Project 2. Polyamines and electrophiles in gastric cancer (PI-Keith Wilson)
Project 3. Regulation of H. pylori virulence by dietary factors that impact gastric cancer (PI-Tim Cover)
The efforts of each Project will be further unified by dynamic interactions with specific Core facilities, consisting
of Gastric Histopathology Core A, Proteomics and Metabolomics Core B, and Administrative Core C, which
includes sophisticated bioinformatics and statistics. By maintaining a grounded focus on interactions that occur
at the H. pylori-host interface, results from this proposed work will not only improve our understanding of gastric
cancer, but will also identify targets for prevention and more effective treatment of this devastating disease."
10765220,"PROJECT SUMMARY
DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) are key epigenetic regulators of chromatin
accessibility, interaction, and function. Changes in the composition, abundance, and distribution of DNA
methylation and histone PTMs, and associated rearrangements in chromatin structure, are defining features of
human cancer and other diseases. While much progress has been made connecting epigenetic regulation to
cellular function and disease, it is still not clear how these regulatory functions are accomplished with spatial and
temporal precision, how these epigenetic signals translate to functional outcomes in chromatin regulation, and
how these changes contribute to disease states. Our long-term goal is to translate basic mechanistic
understanding of chromatin regulatory function into new strategies for the treatment of human diseases. Toward
this goal, we develop and use cutting edge biochemical, genomic, and proteomic technologies to understand the
interconnected molecular activities of chromatin regulatory proteins that “read,” “write,” and “erase” DNA
methylation and histone PTMs. Our past work focused on defining molecular mechanisms regulating the
epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation through cell divisions. We revealed complex mechanisms involving
multivalent DNA and histone associations and allosteric regulation that influence DNA methyltransferase
chromatin targeting and substrate specificity. These studies also contributed to the appreciation that DNA
methyltransferases utilize ubiquitin-dependent protein interactions to facilitate their enzymatic activities, but the
mechanistic details of how DNA methylation and ubiquitin signaling interface are unclear. Our goals in the next
five years are to define regulatory and pathologic mechanisms that connect ubiquitin signaling to the epigenetic
inheritance of DNA methylation. Toward accomplishing these goals, we will study roles for protein ubiquitination
in big picture questions of: 1) how, when, and where DNA methylation regulators are targeted in the genome to
carry out their enzymatic functions; 2) how abnormal 5mC patterns arise in cancer and aging cells; and 3) how
these changes contribute to other molecular hallmarks of these disease and disease-associated states. To
facilitate these studies, we will also 4) develop a new class of ubiquitinated histone affinity reagents that is
generalizable for the enrichment of singly and combinatorially modified histone PTM states. Collectively, our
studies will continue to define fundamental mechanisms regulating DNA methylation inheritance, reveal
pathologic mechanisms associated with abnormal DNA methylation signaling, and introduce new reagents and
methods for this field."
10757354,"SUMMARY
Once considered junk, non-coding regions of the genome have emerged as central components of evolution,
development, and disease. The most common non-coding regulatory elements in the human genome are
enhancers, which ensure expression of target genes at the right time in the right cells by controlling their
activation. Perturbation to enhancer function is widely accepted as a major, but still poorly understood,
component of human brain evolution and disease. There have been major and continuing advances in
annotating enhancers and predicting activity of these elements in cells and tissues, including the brain. Despite
these advances, predicting the sequence-encoded function of enhancers remains a major challenge. Further,
the dynamic and context-dependent chromosomal interactions, epigenetic modifications, and transcription
factor activity that ultimately determine enhancer-mediated gene regulation generally remain poorly
understood. This represents a significant barrier in understanding the function of enhancers and in interpreting
the effect of enhancer sequence variation on human brain development, evolution and disease. As such, there
is critical need to determine the relationship between sequence and function for regulatory DNA, and
to define the determinants of enhancer activity and gene regulation in the brain. In the initial early stage
investigator MIRA funding, we established a productive research program focused elucidating enhancer-
mediated gene regulatory wiring in the mammalian brain. We paired functional assays with genetic and
genomic approaches to model the function of enhancers, transcription factors, and chromatin remodeling
proteins in normal and pathogenic brain development. The overarching goals of our MIRA research program
are to: 1) Extend and apply methods to define sequence-encoded enhancer activity in the mammalian brain, 2)
Determine the molecular mechanisms of enhancer-mediated gene regulation and transcriptional programming
in the brain, and 3) Characterize the consequences of regulatory sequence variation to understand the role of
enhancer DNA in the development, evolution, and disorders of the mammalian brain. In the renewal period, we
will apply integrative genetic, genomic, and neuroscience methods to address key gaps in the understanding of
sequence-encoded enhancer function and to answer fundamental questions regarding gene regulation in the
brain. Our work will address basic and translationally-relevant questions regarding the sufficiency and
necessity of enhancers for neurodevelopmental gene regulation, and will advance the emerging field of
enhancer-based tools for labeling and manipulation of cell types in the brain. Overall, our contributions will help
to decipher how transcriptional control is encoded at the genetic and epigenetic level and to illuminate the gene
regulatory circuitry of the mammalian brain."
10757450,"Project Summary/Abstract
Aging is one of the biggest risk factors for many chronic lung diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
(IPF). However, uncertainties remain as to how age-related processes contribute to the pathogenesis of IPF,
particularly in deciphering the cell types that might play a role in both aging and fibrotic transformation.
Senescence, a cellular state characterized by an irreversible cell cycle arrest and other morphologic
transformations, is thought to be a cellular phenotype that becomes increasingly prevalent in aged organs,
contributing to the decline in function over time. p16INK4A, a tumor suppressor, is one of the best-studied
biomarkers of senescent cells in vitro and in vivo. Numerous genetic models have been built to remove p16INK4A+
cells from tissues, demonstrating a functional role for these cells in promoting age-related pathologies such as
lung fibrosis. Despite the knowledge gained from strategies that remove p16INK4A+ cells, deletion of these cells
precludes the identification and functional characterization of p16INK4A+ cells in vivo, leaving a large gap in our
understanding of how senescent cells might behave in tissues rather than in a culture dish. To address this, we
constructed a novel genetic reporter of senescence by engineering an amplified fluorescent tag driven by
expression of p16INK4A (mouse referred to as INK4A H2B-GFP Reporter-In-Tandem, or INKBRITE) to isolate and
characterize p16INK4A+ cells in vivo and ex vivo. To our surprise, we were able to identify p16INK4A+ fibroblasts in
young and healthy lungs that contribute to scar-forming cells in areas of fibrotic remodeling. Furthermore,
p16INK4A+ cells are able to alter the epithelial progenitor microenvironment and alter stem cell regenerative
outcomes. This led us to the hypothesis that p16INK4A+ fibroblasts are capable of contributing to fibrosis by
forming scars and inducing an pathologic epithelial response, and the INKBRITE reporter could be leveraged as
a screening platform to identify compounds that more precisely target p16INK4A+ fibroblasts in vivo. Through the
use of single cell RNA sequencing, adoptive cell transfers, lineage tracing, high-content imaging, and various
methodologies outlined in this proposal, we aim to better define the cellular contribution of p16INK4A+ fibroblasts
to fibrotic transformation, and define agents that might better remove it from tissues."
10757451,"Project Summary / Abstract
 The goal of this grant is to develop enabling technology to address fundamental limitations in microsurgery
with a specific focus on developing coordinated bilateral assistance for the vitreoretinal surgeon. Retinal vein
occlusion (RVO) is the second-most-prevalent vision threatening disease of retinal blood vessels, with no
consistently successful clinical treatments to directly resolve the occlusion. A strategic approach, that is
particularly amenable to robotic assistance, is to cannulate the occluded retinal vein with a micro-cannula and to
inject a clot-dissolving agent. Due to human physiological limitations (tremor, tactile perception, visualization,
stress, cognitive requirements, incomplete sensory information, etc.), as well as retinal fragility and the inability
to regenerate retinal tissue, various robotic systems have been developed that target select aspects of retinal
vein cannulation (RVC). However, even with all present and emerging technological advances, a number of
imminently solvable challenges remain as barriers to consistently successful treatment. We propose a bilateral
robotic system with real-time multisensory feedback that assesses multiple points of instrument contact located
both inside and outside of the eye. Our bilateral system will enhance retina and sclera safety, increase the rate
of RVC success, diminish forces on the cannula and vein, reduce the human mental and physical requirements,
and allow the surgeon enhanced motion precision to enable more advanced surgical procedures benefitted by
bilateral manipulation.
 To prove the hypothesis that bilateral robot-assisted retinal cannulation is possible and safe, we propose the
following specific aims: (1) Demonstrate coordinated position/force hybrid control algorithms for enabling real-
time sensorimotor capabilities at sclerotomy for safe bilateral robot-assisted vitreoretinal microsurgery: real-time
sensorimotor capabilities at the sclerotomy will be uniquely used to control the robots through a machine learning
method that adaptively learns a nonlinear mapping from user behavior to sclera-force/position and predicts
unsafe motions; (2) Demonstrate position/force-input control algorithms for enabling real-time sensorimotor
capabilities at the tool-tip for safe bilateral robot-assisted vein cannulation: real-time tool-tip-to-tissue interaction
force sensing and non-linear robot control algorithms based on observing user behavior will be used to control
the tool-tip position and force and to prevent entry into subretinal areas during RVC; (3) Demonstrate and
evaluate bilateral RVC using SHER in animal model in vivo: real-time, position/force hybrid control algorithms
based on dual-point (tool-shaft and tip) information fusion will provide sensorimotor guidance of surgical
maneuvers during RVC. Statistically significant results in vivo, in clinically realistic conditions will demonstrate
the feasibility of our approach. This highly innovative system with expanded coordinated bimanual capabilities
will allow us to further increase the safety and reliability of RVC and move the technology to preclinical readiness."

elderly. In the current application, we have expanded our ability to recruit across the lifespan and
across multiple pathogens, including increased expertise in sexually transmitted infections, malaria, and
novel approaches to conducting clinical trial visits in the home setting. The Vanderbilt VTEU has also
led efforts to train the next generation of vaccinologists and clinical trial experts in infectious diseases,
including the development of a vaccinology fellowship, participation of fellows and junior faculty in
protocol teams and data safety committees, and encouraging concept development by junior faculty.

Endothelial cells (ECs), astrocytes and pericytes are integral components of the neurovascular unit (NVU) and
play critical roles in blood brain barrier (BBB) formation and maintenance. These cells express uptake and
efflux membrane transporters that regulate CNS penetration of molecules, therapeutic drugs and toxins. The
function of the BBB and transporters is likely disrupted in many neurological disorders. Thus, development of
tools to study NVU cells and their properties of BBB selective transport in vivo is a key priority in translational
neuroscience research. We have discovered a unique set of small molecules that can be selectively
transported into the cytoplasm of either ECs, pericytes or astrocytes with exquisite affinity and specificity. We
have evidence that these molecules enter cells through membrane transporters, selectively expressed in each
cell type. We hypothesize that these molecules could be adapted as probes for intravital animal and human
imaging and also for cell-specific delivery of drugs. In this proposal, we aim to identify the precise mechanisms
of probe membrane transport in vivo; establish the feasibility of using these molecules as cell-specific drug
carriers or as radiopharmaceuticals for human imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and finally
test their in vivo properties in models of Alzheimer's disease and stroke. This project will improve our
understanding of molecular transport mechanisms across the BBB and may transform the ability to selectively
image and pharmacologically modulate cells of the NVU in health and disease."
10893558,"Latinos with HIV are persistently underserved in the U.S., contributing to poor clinical outcomes and public
health burden. While effective antiretroviral medications are widely available, only half of Latino patients with
HIV are retained in care and have regular access to treatment. Barriers to HIV care for Latinos are numerous,
multi-factorial, and dynamic, such as fear of deportation, stigma, homophobia, emotional well-being and mental
health, inadequate access to transportation to attend clinics, lack of access to primary care, and shortage of
trained providers who can provide culturally attuned care in Spanish. Using culturally acceptable tools can help
these patients overcome existing impediments and develop greater patient activation, self-efficacy, and
emotional well-being and access to the needed core social services on the pathway to viral suppression. The
PI’s recent NIMH-funded K23 award developed and evaluated a Spanish language telenovela-(film) based,
community health worker (CHW)-delivered 5-session intervention, called ADELANTE, which is a theory-based
problem-solving intervention designed to empower Latinos with HIV and link them to existing resources, such
as transportation, to address unmet basic needs. The proposed R01, led by an Early Stage Investigator, will
test ADELANTE in two Ryan White-funded clinics within US Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Plan-identified
geographic areas that have high HIV incidence in Latinos. Building on our prior research and grounded in local
EHE priorities, we will leverage well-established community partnerships and multidisciplinary expertise in
clinical trials, health disparities, mental health and substance use, community engagement, and biostatistics to
accomplish the following aims. In Aim 1, we will randomize 250 Latinos with HIV in a controlled trial to contrast
clinical effectiveness of ADELANTE (5-session, CHW-delivered telenovela-based intervention) versus
enhanced care condition (ECC, 5 reminder phone calls). We hypothesize that ADELANTE participants will
demonstrate higher rates of viral suppression (HIV RNA <200 copies/ml) at month-12 and will have fewer ED
visits and hospitalizations compared with ECC. In Aim 2, we will examine potential mechanisms by which
ADELANTE impacts viral suppression. We hypothesize that participants in ADELANTE will have increased
rates of patient activation, self-efficacy for retention in care, emotional well-being, and referrals for non-
clinical services and these variables will mediate the relationship of ADELANTE with viral suppression. In
Aim 3, we will identify barriers and facilitators to implementation readiness of ADELANTE through in-depth
semi-structured interviews with 40 RCT participants and focus groups with local stakeholders involved with
implementation. This qualitative data will add value in explaining findings, ensuring relevance, and facilitating
future uptake and reach. This approach addresses high priority areas for NIH HIV/AIDS research by
advancing research to reduce health disparities. We anticipate that the merger of technology and CHWs with
culturally relevant content will improve outcomes for Latinos with HIV towards ending the HIV epidemic."

11002781,"Project Summary/Abstract
The United States is experiencing an epidemic of unprecedented scope with heroin use resurging
and a troubling pervasive increase in abuse of prescription opioids such as fentanyl, fentanyl
derivatives, methadone, oxycodone and hydrocodone. More than 6 out of 10 drug overdoses are
now opioid-related, resulting in ~90 deaths/day and a more than $75B/year economic impact.
Additionally, there is a rapidly expanding need to detect numerous other small molecules such as
therapeutic agents, in the home or potential WMDs like sarin and toxic pesticides in the remote
or field setting. To develop a general purpose tool to address such detection, we propose to refine
our compensated interferometric reader (CIR) and further develop a unique and efficient, matrix
insensitive, assay methodology to address the need for high sensitivity, rapid testing of opioids,
therapeutics and environmental contaminants. Our efforts will produce a first of its kind bench-
top (and field-compatible) CIR and user-friendly (turn-key) assay system for the detection and/or
quantification at ng/mL-pg/mL sensitivity of a wide range of targets including opiates, small
molecule drugs, and organophosphorus pesticides. The assay based on a near-surface assay
(NSA) embodiment, consists of three-steps; 1) collect sample (dilute if needed), 2) fill the pre-
coated capillary and 3) read the ‘sample’ with CIR. Results for drug or metabolite detection in
urine by CIR is predicted to be <300 pg/mL sensitivity for the fentanyl family, a >10-1000-fold
improvement over the best lateral flow tests (LFT)1 and the current cutoff for standard drug tests.
The non-invasive, nanoliter volume, high specificity urine or buffer-diluent assays will facilitate
rapid field-based detection of environmental samples, seized illicit narcotics, counterfeit drugs
and organophosphorus nerve agents (OPNA). Similar minimally invasive assays are feasible with
minute amounts of finger-stick blood. The novel methodology is enabled by the marriage of three
patented technologies, a multiplex-SELEX approach for aptamer selection, an aptamer-probe
assay, and CIR to quantify the target. Phase I and Phase II Aims proposed here are designed to
enable rapid translation/commercialization of the proposed technology."
10764665,"The research in the laboratory focuses on understanding the fundamental mechanisms of translation and
action of ribosome-targeting antibiotics. One of the underappreciated aspects of translation that has transpired
from our studies is its context specific nature. We learned that the ability of the ribosome to decode genetic
information rapidly and efficiently is significantly influenced by the nature of its tRNA and mRNA substrates
and/or properties of the polypeptide being made. Specific sequences have been identified as difficult to
polymerize but, more than likely, there are many other that also present an obstacle for the translating ribosome.
Why some sequences are challenging for translation and what mechanisms exist in the cell to help the ribosome
overcome such problems are questions that have remained unanswered.
 Several conserved auxiliary translation factors (auxTFs) encoded in the bacterial genomes are thought to
assist the ribosome in synthesizing proteins during fast growth or under stress, likely facilitating translation of the
problematic sequence motifs. However, our knowledge of the nature of the sequences whose translation is
facilitated by the auxTFs, about the molecular mechanisms of their action and of their physiological significance
is limited at best. Answering these vexing questions is the goal of the proposal.
 We will use crosslinking-based ribosome profiling (XLRibo-seq) to map the genomic sites where auxTFs are
recruited to the ribosome. Guided by these genome-wide data, we will select the most revealing gene models to
dissect in vitro the precise nature of the problematic sequence motifs and elucidate the molecular mechanisms
of the auxTF action. The inferred mechanisms will be validated in vivo and the physiological role of the auxTFs
will be deduced by following the expression of specifically designed reporters under suitable growth conditions
or using the appropriate mutants.
 The overall experimental approach will be first optimized using, as a model system, translation termination
factors RF1 and RF2, and then applied to four most intriguing auxTFs (LepA, EttA, BirA and HflX) whose
specificity, activity and physiological role remain enigmatic despite being investigated previously by other
techniques. The approach could be extended to several other known or suspected auxTFs and even to the main
translation factors whose activity could be conceivably modulated by the context of the translated sequence.
 The innovation of the proposal stems from the development of new methodologies (XLRibo-seq) with a broad
application to studies of basic mechanisms of translation, and from revealing the functions and molecular
mechanisms of action of conserved proteins playing important roles in expression of genetic information.
 The experiments build upon the long-term interests, previous findings, and expertise of our research group.
The project will provide new training and teaching opportunities and facilitate the outreach activities of the lab."

Cellular metabolism instructs immune cell functions in both physiological and disease conditions. Activation of
immune cells in response to invading pathogens induces a robust metabolic reprogramming, which has been
indicated to play a critical role in orchestrating immune cell functions. The possibility of modulating immune
cell function through metabolic regulation represents a new strategy to strengthen host defense mechanism.
However, the role of individual metabolic pathways and enzymes during pathogen infection is not well
understood, which represents a critical knowledge gap. Recently, we have identified the O-GlcNAc transferase
(OGT), an important glucose metabolism enzyme, as a critical regulator of innate immune signaling during
virus infection and septic inflammation. OGT mediates a ubiquitous post-translational modification (PTM) of
cytosolic and nuclear proteins, known as O-GlcNAcylation. OGT-mediated O-GlcNAc signaling is well known
as an essential regulator of many fundamental aspects of cell physiology and dysregulated O-GlcNAc signaling
occurs in numerous human diseases. Despite a broad pathophysiological significance of OGT, the function of
OGT in host defense mechanism against pathogen infection is just emerging and still underappreciated. Our
preliminary results indicate that OGT directly restricts intracellular replication of both virus and bacteria, in
addition to its previously established impacts on regulating innate immune signaling. By studying cell and
mouse models with either OGT gene-deletion (Ogt-KO) or enzyme-inactive OGT (OgtK908A), we observed both
enzyme-dependent and -independent functions of OGT in modulating innate immune signaling and limiting
intracellular pathogen replication. We hypothesize that OGT serves as a central component of host
defense mechanism by sensing pathogen infection and integrating innate immune signaling and
cellular lipid metabolism via both enzyme activity-dependent and -independent manner.
 The long-term objective of our work is to determine the principles, functions and mechanisms of OGT
and O-GlcNAc signaling in health and diseases. In this proposal, we aim to use our newly developed OGT
enzyme-inactive mouse model and OGT gene-deletion model to understand the molecular mechanism by
which OGT mediates host defense responses against invading virus and bacteria. We will advance this goal
through three directions: 1) how does OGT sense virus infection and integrate innate immune response and
cellular fatty acid synthesis pathway? 2) what is the functional importance of OGT-mediated protein O-
GlcNAcylation in the detection of intracellular bacteria? and 3) how does the ubiquitination of OGT affect host
defense? This study will significantly advance the field of immunometabolism by elucidating the function and
mechanism of an important metabolic enzyme sensing and antagonizing pathogen infection. Successful
development of OGT enzyme-inactive mouse model will also benefit other research topics such as cancer,
diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases."
10765179,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although it has been established that the gut microbiota influence normal physiology and transitions to
disease, the roles played by microbial proteins in these complex molecular processes are still poorly
understood. Through this project, we will examine the structures and functions of diverse gut microbial
enzymes, modulate their activities with targeted small molecules, and unravel their roles in human disease.
Over the last five years, we have elucidated the structures and functions of key microbial protein families,
created gut bacterial enzyme inhibitors, and developed novel multi-omics approaches to examine gut microbial
processes. Here we will focus on pathways that are unique to the gut microbiome, concentrating specifically
on bile salt hydrolases, tryptophan-indole lyases, and -glucuronidases. Bile salt hydrolases convert amino
acid-conjugated bile salts to free bile acids with direct effects on the host and the microbiota. We will unravel
the diversity in structures and functions of bile salt hydrolases in the gut microbiome and pinpoint the roles
these enzymes play in recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. Gut microbial tryptophan-indole lyases, or
tryptophanases, are the only source indole in humans. Indole is converted to the uremic toxin indoxyl-sulfate,
which exacerbates kidney and heart diseases. We will characterize tryptophan-indole lyases in the human gut
microbiome and will target these enzymes with novel, potent and selective inhibitors to block indoxyl-sulfate
formation in animal models. Finally, -glucuronidases reactivate previously inactivated endobiotics in the gut
including serotonin, dopamine, and estrogen. We will define the roles that gut microbial -glucuronidases play
in the antenatal depression experienced by one in seven expectant mothers by evaluating their impacts on
neurotransmitter and steroid hormone levels. Overall, this interdisciplinary project will employ the tools of
structural and chemical biology, biochemistry, and multi-omics and will take advantage of human clinical
samples and select mouse models. In summary, the proposed research program will define how gut microbial
enzymes influence human disease toward the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms."
10767813,"This study will characterize trends in incidence of HIV, HCV and OD associated with binational drug
markets and drug tourism (DT) between San Diego (SD) and Tijuana (TJ), Mexico. TJ sits on a major
drug trafficking route whereby heroin, fentanyl, meth & cocaine are trafficked to the US. After Mexico
partially decriminalized small amounts of drugs in 2009, 1 in 6 people who inject drugs (PWID) in SD
reported injecting drugs in TJ, where drugs were “cheaper and easier to buy”. Since Mexico recently
relaxed its opiate prescription laws, disparities in drug availability and price between SD and TJ will
likely widen, fueling increased DT that will impact the above health outcomes. We hypothesize that
greater penetration of fentanyl into local drug markets will be associated with riskier behaviors that
increase HIV and HCV incidence. Our study is timely since retail drug markets are changing in Tijuana
with drug tourists likely to be acquiring riskier behaviors. Health outcomes in these border cities likely
serve as a ‘bellwether’ for other U.S. cities. The specific aims for our proposed study, called La Línea
(“The Line”) are: AIM 1. To prospectively characterize cross-border DT between SD and TJ and its
association with retail drug market characteristics. AIM 2. To characterize retail drug market trends in
TJ versus SD by conducting epidemiologic and ethnographic surveillance, triangulating quantitative and
qualitative findings and DEA administrative data. AIM 3. To study real-time HCV and HIV cross-border
transmission among PWID with molecular epidemiology. AIM 4. To characterize OD incidence and its
associations with drug retail markets and DT. AIM 5. To conduct dynamic modeling of future HIV, HCV
and OD incidence among PWID in SD in the context of changing drug retail markets to inform
prevention interventions. La Línea will conduct prospective quantitative and qualitative surveillance of
retail drug markets in both SD and TJ, coupled with epidemiologic data collection of 600 PWID (200
drug tourists from SD; 200 non-drug tourists from SD and 200 non-drug tourists from TJ) and an
ethnographic sub-cohort (N=75; 25 per group). We will analyze PWIDs’ HIV and HCV sequencing data
to prospectively assess cross-border transmission. We will incorporate longitudinal data on binational
retail drug markets and HIV and HCV sequencing data into dynamic mathematical models to forecast
future HIV, HCV and OD incidence trends. Since the direction of cross-border HIV transmission is now
occurring from Mexico to the US for the first time and HIV incidence among PWID in TJ is high,
monitoring trends in HIV and HCV incidence in the border region is critical to avoid future US
outbreaks. This study addresses both the NIDA’s HEAL initiative and the Trans-NIH plan of the OAR,
by conducting time-sensitive research to inform implementation of timely interventions to reduce
incidence of HIV, HCV and OD."
10890179,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human variants in the submembrane cytoskeleton-associated protein ankyrin-B (AnkB) have been identified as
risk factors for diabetes, obesity and cardiometabolic diseases. Mice harboring these human variants have AnkB
deficiency in multiple metabolic tissues, including skeletal muscle (SKM), and develop age-dependent obesity
and systemic glucose mishandling. While SKM is a primary target of AnkB deficiency, how AnkB contributes to
the regulation of SKM cellular metabolism and energetic capacity, and AnkB’s SKM-specific roles in promoting
systemic metabolic homeostasis have not been elucidated.
The goal of this study is to test the overarching hypothesis that AnkB forms a complex with mitochondria and
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident proteins to promote the formation of mitochondria-ER contact sites
and calcium transfer between the two organelles. I postulate that this function of AnkB is essential for
maintaining mitochondria homeostasis and for proper skeletal muscle metabolism and bioenergetics.
The first aim will define how AnkB interacts with mitochondria in skeletal muscle and the extent of its contribution
to the formation of mitochondria-ER contact sites and to mitochondria calcium flux. The second aim will define
the contribution of AnkB to SKM cellular respiration and the bioenergetic capacity of SKM. These studies will
provide mechanistic and functional insights into a novel role of AnkB in skeletal muscle metabolism that may
translate to other cell types with high energetic demand, and might be relevant to physiological processes,
including adaptation to exercise and ageing. Moreover, through the proposed work I will uncover novel
pathophysiological mechanisms of AnkB variants that will further explain their contribution to metabolic diseases."

 HIV infection continues to take a severe toll on Mozambique, which underscores the need for investments
in building research capacity to help combat the epidemic. To address this need, we propose to establish the
University of Pittsburgh (Pitt)-Mozambique HIV Research Training Program (Pitt-MozHRTP). The purpose of
the program is to build research capacity at two sister institutions of the Mozambique National Institute of
Health: the Polana Caniço Health Research Center (CISPOC) in Maputo, the capital city, and the Beira
Operations Research Center (CIOB), which is in the port city of Beira in central Mozambique. CISPOC and
CIOB both have growing HIV research portfolios and a commensurate need for increased research capacity.
The research focus of our program is COVID-19, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes in people with HIV
(CCD-PWH), all areas of enormous clinical and public health importance. Pitt-MozHRTP training sites will be at
Pitt and the University of Stellenbosch (SU) in Cape Town, South Africa. The program will be directed by Dr.
Lee Harrison at Pitt; Dr. Edna Viegas, who is responsible for overseeing research at CISPOC; and Dr. Jean
Nachega at SU. A broad array of degree (both PhD and master's) training opportunities will be available in
epidemiology and biostatistics, and laboratory sciences. In addition, we will offer post-doctoral fellowships for
exceptional candidates who have recently completed their doctoral training. We will also use workshops
conducted at CISPOC to augment research capacity at both CISPOC and CIOB. The program includes a
multidisciplinary group of experienced mentors and excellent training opportunities at each site. Each trainee
will have at least two mentors, one in Mozambique and another at the training site. The inclusion of SU
provides substantial opportunities for “south-to-south” training between Mozambique and neighboring South
Africa. In addition, the more experienced CISPOC will assist in building research capacity at CIOB. Trainees
will have access to all the substantial resources of the participating institutions. Over the five-year funding
period, we plan to train 6 masters students, 3 PhD students, and 5 post-doctoral fellows. In addition, ten
trainees will attend the Johns Hopkins Graduate Summer Institute of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and we
will conduct nine workshops at CISPOC. In summary, the Pitt-MozHRTP will make major contributions to
building research capacity in the area CCD-PWH in Mozambique by providing a broad array of exceptional
training opportunities."

Alcohol use is rapidly increasing in low- and middle-income countries, where it is inexpensive, readily available,
poorly regulated, and there are few resources devoted to promoting safe alcohol use. Like many other limited
resource settings, there are no treatment facilities or addiction practitioners in the Kilimanjaro region of
Tanzania. For many in this setting, they only seek care after an emergency like an acute injury. From our
preliminary work, we have seen that 30% of injury patients presenting for care in the Emergency Department
report excess alcohol use and are at risk of a repeat injury. A Brief Intervention based on a motivational
interviewing framework has been shown to reduce alcohol use and alcohol-related harms. We have translated
and adapted a Brief Intervention for alcohol to the Tanzanian context and Swahili language called “Punguza
Pombe Kwa Afya Yako (PPKAY)/ Reduce Alcohol for Your Health.” This project will evaluate this
intervention in injury patients presenting for care at the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center in Moshi,
Tanzania. By using innovative adaptive clinical trial methods, we will expedite the development of the most
effective way to integrate this intervention into clinical care. By the end of this project, we will have identified
the most effective brief intervention components and be able to characterize the intervention’s effect overall.
Additionally, we will standardize adaptive trial methods to revolutionize the science of clinical trials for
behavioral sciences in low-resource settings."
10768593,"Within the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, around 25% of military veterans have diabetes
and the economic burden of lower limb amputations exceeded $200 million for fiscal year 2010.
Beyond the economic costs, the loss of mobility and independence in these veterans has a significant
impact on veteran quality of life and that of their caregivers. Despite innovations in both wound care
and diabetes management, diabetic ulcers remain the leading cause of amputation for VA patients.
 Normal wound healing in healthy individuals initiates quickly and proceeds through well-
characterized, iterative steps; however, in diabetic wounds, the healing process stalls at the transition
between resolution of inflammation and initiation of tissue reorganization. In healthy individuals, this
transition is characterized by a shift away from inflammation and an associated population shift in
macrophages (Mф). It has been well established that there is a correlation between inflammation and
diabetes; however, the role of chronic inflammation at the skin in diabetics has not been explored.
 MΦs display remarkable functional plasticity and are generally are divided into M1 MΦs
(classically activated, pro-inflammatory) and a broad set of M2 MΦs (alternatively activated, anti-
inflammatory). M2 MΦs have been further subdivided into M2a, M2b, M2c, and M2d subtypes. Our
preliminary data demonstrate that metabolic landscape within the wound is an important variable in
healing and supports our overarching idea that immunomodulation of wound-associated MΦs is
necessary for wound resolution. The primary goal of this research project is to develop a preliminary
model of biomarkers that can accurately predict whether a wound will either respond or not respond to
current standards of care.
 To achieve this goal, we will utilize an ex vivo MΦ polarization model to quantify the impact of
host metabolic health (based on donor HemA1c serum levels) on MΦ functional phenotype. MΦ
plasticity will be quantified using a Complex Systems Biology approach, incorporating multiplexed
cytokine/chemokine/growth factor profile with myeloid gene expression, global metabolomics, semi-
targeted lipidomics, and real-time, live cell metabolism profiling. While our ex vivo MΦ model uses
primary cells collected from human donors, confirmation of our candidate biomarkers will require
using our Complex Systems Biology approach in situ to confirm that candidate biomarkers can be
detected with clinical samples. Primary wound debridement samples will be collected over time and for
probed for candidate biomarkers by quantitative immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ
hybridization. Finally, primary wound tissue will be profiled over time with targeted metabolite
biomarkers to confirm efficacy of biomarkers as clinical targets.
 Finally, utilizing biomarker discovery statistics based on receiver-curve-characteristic (ROC) curve
analysis, biomarkers will be selected for inclusion in our predictive model. Predictive modeling will
utilize Random Forest machine learning and test efficacy of predictive models based on benchmarks of
current clinical care, our selected biomarkers, or a combination of both. Once statistical strength of
predictive model determines best fit, the model will be assessed clinically in parallel with standard of
care. Ultimately, our hope is to lay the foundation for better prediction of wound treatment protocols,
promote design of novel wound-care therapeutics, and take the first step towards Precision Medicine
wound care for our diabetic veterans."

In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health overturned Roe v. Wade,
eliminating federal protections for abortion access nationwide. The Dobbs decision rapidly upended fifty years
of legal precedent and health policy. Fourteen states have banned abortion, state legislatures have introduced
85 bills to protect or restrict abortion access, and courts in eight states have temporarily blocked the passage of
abortion bans. Over 33.6 million people with childbearing capacity now live in states where abortion is banned
or likely to be heavily restricted. The effect of these rapidly changing policies on abortion access will be
profound, yet the consequences of these policies on public health indices are unknown. People with chronic
and complex medical conditions are particularly vulnerable to adverse health consequences as a result of
abortion policy. At baseline, these individuals are at high risk for severe maternal morbidity and maternal
mortality as compared to other birthing people. Prior to the Dobbs decision, abortion care allowed for life-
altering care among people whose underlying health conditions complicated healthy pregnancy. However, few
studies had described the impact of abortion on the health and well-being of individuals with chronic diseases;
thus, it is unclear how the Dobbs decision will impact their clinical outcomes. Our study, Investigating Time-
sensitive Reproductive Health Equity Post-Dobbs for Patients with ChronIc Disease (INTREPID), will evaluate
the time-sensitive impact of evolving abortion policies on the health and well-being of patients, particularly
those with chronic diseases that increase the risk of severe maternal morbidity and maternal mortality (e.g.,
cardiovascular disease, cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus); the clinical practice of physicians who care for
people with chronic diseases; and downstream clinical outcomes at a population level. We will use survey-
based, qualitative, and epidemiologic approaches to realize our Specific Aims, which are to: 1) Evaluate,
among people who are seeking abortion, who is able or not able to obtain a wanted abortion, and to assess their
longitudinal outcomes related to health and well-being; 2) Assess, among physicians, the impact of abortion
policy on medical decision-making and practice; and 3) Generate new evidence about the impact of abortion
policy on population-based pregnancy outcomes (e.g., severe maternal morbidity, maternal mortality) and
healthcare-related outcomes (e.g., contraception and teratogenic medication prescribing). The INTREPID
research team has multidisciplinary expertise in medicine, obstetrics, family planning research, health equity,
health policy, and epidemiology. Our project seeks to inform health policy that will optimize reproductive
healthcare and clinical outcomes in the post-Dobbs era."
10770581,"Information flow through neural circuits is dynamic. The set of brain areas that are engaged in computation are
ever changing according to behavioral demands. How circuits in the brain are functionally coupled and
uncoupled on behavioral time scales so that information can be relayed to the appropriate place at the
appropriate time remains a major outstanding question in systems neuroscience. This question is of particular
relevance in the motor system. The production of movements is one of the most fundamental functions of the
brain, and in mammals, flexible movements depend on the motor cortex. Neural activity in the motor is cortex
complex, made up of control signals that drive movements in addition to activity related to motor planning,
learning, and other cognitive processes. This wide array of signals is multiplexed within the same circuit and,
often, within the same cells. How does the brain regulate which activity patterns are communicated to the
periphery to drive movements and which are confined to local circuits for local cortical computation? An
influential hypothesis proposed to explain why only some activity patterns generate movements – the null
space model – provides a biologically plausible computational strategy for segregating cognitive signals from
those that are transmitted to the periphery to produce movement. The null space model suggests that
cognitive signals are restricted to patterns whose impact on downstream motor areas effectively cancel out –
they are ‘output-null.’ Preliminary evidence suggests that activity patterns in the primate motor cortex may be
consistent with the null space model, but thus far it has been challenging to establish a causal link between
these neural activity patterns and behavior.
In this proposal, we examine the flow of neural signals from the motor cortex to the motor neurons that control
the musculature to determine whether the null space model accurately predicts which neural signals have a
causal role in generating movements. Powerful, emerging methods for multi-regional physiology allow us to
examine neural activity at each processing stage along this pathway, an essential requirement for
understanding how cortical activity patterns are transformed into movements. Cell-type specific optogenetic
perturbations allow us to disambiguate the neural signals that drive movements from those that are simply a
consequence and will help to establish a causal relationship between neural activity and movements.
Understanding how neural activity relates to behavior will ultimately help us better interpret the deficits
expressed in movement disorders and motivate improved brain-machine interfaces and biomimetic control
strategies for use in the next generation of artificial systems."
10770669,"Critical to the success of clinical care and translational science is an awareness by clinicians and researchers
that diseases are characterized by sex and gender differences in epidemiology, pathophysiology, manifestations,
progression, and response to treatment. Harnessing the biological forces that define disease manifestation and
severity in one sex compared to the other may help transform its diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, sex-based
precision medicine (SPM) is fundamental to precision medicine that will benefit women and men. A
transdisciplinary approach is necessary to understand the complex interactions between genes, hormones,
environment, social factors, and disease. The proposed Tulane Center of Biomedical Research Excellence in
Sex-Based Precision Medicine (COBRE in SPM) will address this critical barrier in the field. The overarching
goal of the COBRE in SPM is to 1) create a transdisciplinary center that will investigate sex and gender factors
that interact with other determinants of health to affect biology and disease, 2) prepare early-stage and new
investigators (ESI/NI) for independent federal funding, and 3) achieve national prominence. The Specific Aims
of the COBRE are to 1) create a university-wide center that fosters transdisciplinary collaborations between
basic, clinical, epidemiological, and social sciences to stimulate innovative research and discoveries on the role
of sex and gender in biology, disease, and medicine, 2) develop a critical mass of highly trained investigators
studying SPM and enhance their ability to compete for external funding through a strong mentoring program, 3)
recruit new investigators to the field of SPM research by engaging them in the use of COBRE resources, and 4)
establish an infrastructure to advance the science of SPM and improve health through an innovative Enrichment
Program that will train the next generation of highly qualified SPM investigators. To accomplish these aims, the
COBRE in SPM will rely on the following specific strategies: An Administrative Core to coordinate and supervise
research and pilot projects, scientific mentoring and career development activities, and all components of the
COBRE. Protected time and research support for three Research Project Leaders (RPLs) to allow them to
establish independent, federally funded research programs on SPM. A Structured Career & Mentoring Plan to
assist ESI/NI in advancing their independent research and becoming NIH-funded investigators. A Pilot Project
Program to provide seed support to ESI/NI to catalyze groundbreaking research that will lead to the submission
of successful NIH R01s or to COBRE Research Projects. An SPM Enrichment Program to support 1) a
Curriculum highlighting the importance of SPM; 2) a Bootcamp that provides skill-based training to investigate
SPM for ESI/NI and established scientists; 3) an SPM Seminar Series; and 4) a Workshop and annual
Symposium that showcases advances in SPM research, builds collaborative networks, and promotes SPM
research broadly. An SPM Research Core to serve RPLs and Pilot Project Leaders and provide statistical and

10771199,"Project Summary/Abstract
Heart failure poses a major public health challenge in the United States, with growing prevalence particularly
among non-white individuals and individuals of low socioeconomic status (SES). An expanding number of
medications have been shown to improve survival in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
(HFrEF). The list of guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT) includes beta-blockers, angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, and
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. When used in combination, these medications reduce all-cause
mortality by > 50%. Nonetheless, fewer than 25% of eligible patients receive 3 or more of these medications, at
any dose, with particularly low rates of utilization among low SES individuals.
The polypill refers to a fixed-dose combination of medications in a single pill, aimed at reducing pill burden and
improving adherence. The polypill strategy offers a means by which therapy with multiple medications can be
conveniently initiated at an early stage of disease, increasing the overall therapeutic benefit accrued over time.
This is particularly relevant in settings where patients experience barriers to care due to high costs, frequent
lab tests, and need for multiple follow up visits.
We propose a single-center, pragmatic trial of a polypill-based strategy for the treatment of HFrEF in a low-
income, racially-diverse population. We will enroll 175 adults with HFrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction
[LVEF] < 40%) receiving care at Parkland Hospital who are not on optimal, target dose of guideline-directed
medical therapy at a large county hospital in Dallas, TX. Participants will be randomized to receiving a polypill
or usual care. The primary endpoint of the study is the change in LVEF, and the key secondary outcome will be
change in circulating NT-proBNP levels, quality-of-life, six minute walk distance, and the adherence to
guideline directed medical therapy at 12 months. We hypothesize that use of a polypill-based strategy in
HFrEF will be feasible and lead to improved left ventricular systolic function, NT-proBNP levels, quality of life,
and adherence to target dose guideline directed medical therapy compared with usual care."
10771204,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project is a continuation and further development of a previous INIA project, which was based on studies
showing ethanol-induced changes in neuroimmune gene expression in animal models and humans. Those
data suggested that ethanol dysregulates Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling through the myeloid differentiation
primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and thereby promotes excessive ethanol intake. Our most recent work
showed that genetic and pharmacological manipulation of another branch of TLR signaling via the TIR-domain-
containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) protein also regulates ethanol intake. In exploring downstream
mechanisms by which these signaling disruptions act, we found that chronic alcohol consumption increased
several TRIF-dependent signaling components, including type 1 interferons (IFN1s). These findings lead us to
the central hypothesis of this renewal application, which is that chronic alcohol exposure activates pathways
leading to IFN1 production and expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which increase alcohol
consumption. To test this hypothesis, we will study alcohol intake and alcohol-related behaviors in mice
deficient in critical components of pathways leading to IFN1 production and signaling, and in mice administered
compounds that block IFN1 signaling. The proposal has three Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 will study
changes in alcohol consumption in mice undergoing every other day two-bottle choice (EOD-2BC) drinking for
at least 4 weeks. To reduce IFN1 production, we will examine these behaviors in mice with genetic deletion of
the transcription factors Irf3 or Irf7. To examine the role of IFN1 signaling, we will use Ifnar1 knockout mice
which carry a null mutation in the IFN1 receptor. We will also study wild-type mice treated with inhibitors of the
kinase TYK2, which mediates IFN1 receptor signaling. Specific Aim 2 will determine if EOD-2BC drinking
induces IFN1 responses in specific brain regions by detecting Fos expression in Mx1GFP mice in which the
interferon-stimulated response element of the Mx1 gene drives GFP expression. Data from these whole brain
imaging studies will be shared with the Harsan-Keiffer project to be incorporated into their multimodal
connectome analyses. To determine if IFN1 regulates alcohol responses in certain regions, we will knockout
Ifnar1 using local microinjection of Cre recombinase in floxed Ifnar mice and use Fos-Cre-ER (TRAP2) mice to
knockout or knockdown Ifnar1 in activated neurons and glia. Specific Aim 3 will identify ISGs induced by
EOD-2BC alcohol drinking in brain regions identified in Aim 2. The Mayfield project will help us analyze
transcriptomic data to identify ISGs. To investigate causality, groups of ISGs will be knocked down using
multiplex CRISPR interference in collaboration with the Farris-Homanics project. We anticipate that some other
INIA projects will identify additional proteins that require behavioral testing with pharmacological agents or
genetically modified mice, which we will carry out as part of this consortium.

10771242,"Heart failure kills 1 in 10 people over the age of 65 in the USA. We recently identified a combination of four cell-
cycle regulators that induces stable cytokinesis in adult cardiomyocytes to replace their loss following myocardial
infarction. Specifically, adenoviral overexpression of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), CDK4, cyclin B1, and
cyclin D1 (collectively known as 4F, i.e. four factors), efficiently induced cell division in post-mitotic mouse, rat,
and human cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of the cell-cycle regulators was self-limiting through proteasome-
mediated degradation of the protein products in cardiomyocytes. In vivo, lineage tracing using the Mosaic
Analysis of Double Marker (MADM) mouse model revealed that 15–20% of adult cardiomyocytes expressing the
4F underwent stable cell division, with significant improvement in cardiac function after acute or subacute
myocardial infarction. Currently, our approach is the most robust method to induce cardiomyocyte proliferation;
however, clinical applicability in humans is limited by concerns for tumorigenic potential in other organs. Our
preliminary data in vitro shows that in other cell types (e.g. neurons), 4F induce cell proliferation continuously for
5-6 successive rounds over 7 days. Therefore, in this proposal we will focus on approaches to make cell cycle
induction in cardiomyocytes more clinically applicable and avoid any oncogenic potential.
We hypothesize that a transient and cardiomyocyte-specific expression is needed to induce one cycle of
cardiomyocyte proliferation to avoid any potential adverse effects on other tissues. Our preliminary data shows
that TNNT2 derived 4F expression in NIL is robustly inducing proliferation in vitro and in vivo and improved
cardiac function after myocardial infarction. Here, we will rigorously demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this
polycistronic NIL encoding 4F expression driven by the cardiac specific promoter of TNNT2 (TNNT-4F-NIL) in
inducing cardiomyocyte division and improving cardiac function after myocardial infarction in vivo in rat and pig
models as well as in situ in human heart slices from healthy and infarcted hearts. Here, we aim first to fully
demonstrate the efficacy and specificity of TNNT-4F-NIL to induce proliferation only in cardiomyocytes in vivo.
Secondly, we will test the functional efficacy and perform initial safety studies for TNNT-4F-NIL in rat and pig
models of heart failure. Lastly, we will demonstrate the efficacy of TNNT-4F-NIL in inducing adult human
cardiomyocyte proliferation in situ in human heart slices and improving contractile function of failing human heart
slices. This study will address all preclinical efficacy testing and perform initial safety studies for one of the most
promising approaches to regenerate the heart. The successful completion of this study will allow the start of first
in human clinical trial."

 Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent for the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhea, is
responsible for over 800,000 infections annually in the U.S. and 78 million cases worldwide. Untreated or
untreatable infections can lead to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in females, gonococcal arthritis
in both sexes, and an increased risk of both contracting and transmitting HIV. Over the past several decades,
the inexorable increase of resistance in this organism toward multiple classes of antibiotics has severely limited
treatment options for gonococcal infections. Most alarmingly, resistance against the extended-spectrum
cephalosporin (ESC) ceftriaxone poses a serious threat to public health. This situation requires an
understanding of antibiotic resistance at the molecular level in order to enable design of new antimicrobials.
 ESC resistance of N. gonorrhoeae is conferred by mutated forms of penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2).
In this application, we propose to elucidate the molecular mechanism of resistance, with the overarching
hypothesis that mutations in PBP2 restrict the molecular dynamics of the protein. It builds upon our recent
understanding of the interactions made by wild-type PBP2 when bound by ESCs and how conformational
changes associated with binding and acylation appear restricted in PBP2 derived from ESCR strains. The
investigation comprises three aims: Specific Aim 1 is a structure-function analysis of wild-type PBP2 to
investigate the importance of specific interactions formed when PBP2 is bound and acylated by
cephalosporins. In Specific Aim 2, we will elucidate how key mutations present in PBP2 from ESCR strains of
N. gonorrhoeae reduce inactivation by cephalosporins while retaining sufficient biological function to support
growth of the organism. Finally, Specific Aim 3 will examine the behavior of PBP2 variants in solution to
determine whether mutations hinder protein dynamics. By revealing the molecular mechanisms of how
mutations in PBP2 overcome the lethal action of β-lactams, these investigations will enable new strategies for
the development of replacement anti-gonococcal agents."
10778198,"The aim of the current proposal is to test the hypothesis that signaling through 5-HT1A
receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex during adolescence is important for establishing
lifelong motivation. Prior work suggests that disruption of the serotonin system during
early post-natal development in animal models results in altered anxiety and mood
related behaviors in the full-grown adult animal. One receptor that is particularly relevant
in this regard is the 5-HT1A receptor. Recent data from our lab suggests that loss of
serotonin signaling through 5-HT1A receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex during
adolescence but not during adulthood, results in decreased motivation related behavioral
setpoints. We hypothesize that this is true for both appetitive and avoidance motivation.
The current proposal both examines mechanisms through which altered serotonin
signaling through 5-HT1A receptors in adolescence leads to changes in motivation and
further elucidates the specific nature of the reinforcement related behavior that is
affected. In addition to a loss of function, we will use a biased 5-HT1A agonist as a gain
of function approach bi-directionally modulate 5-HT1A signaling Using slice physiology,
we will assess whether 5-HT1A expressing neurons alter their intrinsic properties as a
result of the disrupted 5-HT1A mediated signaling, or whether there are compensatory
changes in circuit properties resulting from the disruption. Using fiber photometry, we
will determine how the medial prefrontal cortex engages with other circuit nodes like the
dorsal raphe nucleus in tasks that tax motivational systems, with the goal of
understanding the circuit basis for the disrupted behavior. Finally, we will directly
assess whether the sensitivity of mPFC pyramidal neurons to inputs during adolescence
is the critical factor in establishing later motivation. We will do this by manipulating
mPFC principal neuron activity during the sensitive period in adolescence using
DREADDS. Understanding how mPFC plasticity in adolescence can be harnessed to
modulate motivation is a potentially promising strategy for addressing disorder that
emerge in adolescence and often include a prominent motivational component.

10772317,"Project Summary
 Recent innovations by project investigators have established an important new framework for sustaining
the anti-thrombotic properties of blood contacting films in order to improve the clinical performance of a variety of
implanted cardiovascular devices. Notably, we have discovered highly active, orthogonal sortase mutants that
recognize unique peptide sorting motifs, enabling repeated covalent assembly and disassembly of surface
bound biomolecular constituents, thereby providing a means to regenerate anti-thrombotic constituents on blood
contacting films after device implantation. While precedent exists for the therapeutic use of foreign proteins,
recent innovations by project collaborators have also led to the development of novel computational and
experimental tools for protein deimmunization to mitigate any immunogenic risk that may be associated with
sortase-derived enzymes. Importantly, we have also developed new chemoenzymatic schemes leading to the
discovery of a synthetic heparin that is resistant to heparanase mediated biodegradation, forming the basis of a
novel family of highly durable heparin thin films. These breakthroughs offer an opportunity to extend the lifetime
of a bioactive film with commensurate improvements in clinical outcomes. In this proposal we intend to:
(1) Design synthetic heparins that are resistant to heparanase and characterize their capacity to limit
thrombus formation as a component of a ‘rechargeable’ thin film. Chemoenzymatic and orthogonal ligation
schemes will be used to generate synthetic heparins that are resistant to heparanase mediated biodegradation.
In addition to characterizing the biostability of these new heparin analogues, anticoagulant activity will be
determined, and pharmacokinetic properties defined. The rechargeability of thin films comprised of synthetic
heparin analogues will be evaluated in vitro and after extended blood-contacting periods in vivo.
(2) Design functionally deimmunized sortase variants to facilitate in situ recharging of bioactive thin
films through deletion of immunogenic T cell epitopes. The cellular immunogenicity of a pentamutant
sortase variant, eSrtALPETG, will be assessed and T cell epitopes driving the response mapped in naïve human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Computational tools will be used to design functionally deimmunized
candidate eSrtALPETG variants, which will be evaluated for their maintenance of transpeptidation activity and their
reduction of cellular immunogenicity. Lead candidates will be assessed in humanized HLA transgenic mice.
(3) Synthesize and characterize blood contacting thin films that enable selective and repetitive
regeneration of multiple bioactive constituents that inhibit thrombin generation. In the first phase of these
investigations, we plan to define the capacity of deimmunized sortase variants to facilitate the fabrication of
rechargeable, multicomponent bioactive thin films that contain both synthetic heparin and recombinant
thrombomodulin. During the second phase, we will define the ability of an anti-thrombogenic thin film containing
multiple rechargeable bioactive constituents to extend the patency of a small diameter vascular graft."
10746815,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a disease of the bone marrow with expansion of immature
cells and treated with non-specific chemotherapy. ALL remains one of the leading causes of cancer death in
persons <20 years old. The developmental origin of T cell ALL (T-ALL) is and profoundly impacts the clinic.
Genetic mutations pointed aberrant Ras signals with causal role in 50% of T-ALL, but how such aberrant
signals impact developmental trajectories in T-ALL is not known. Similarly, it is by and large unknown how to
effectively inhibit aberrant Ras signals.
 During 1R01CA187318 we uncovered a new molecular paradigm in Ras signaling; Oncogenic Ras
mutations (KRasG12D) and overexpression of the Ras activator RasGRP1 drive two very distinctive leukemic
Ras signals. In the progress report with our new RoLoRiG/Mx1CRE mouse model, we show that these two
aberrant Ras signals both induce abnormal hematopoiesis, but with opposing stem cell features. Capitalizing
on our quantitative, multiplex flow cytometry platform we determined that Ras and RasGRP1 frequently
connect to PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-AKT/mTOR signaling in T-ALL. Next, we performed four
extensive synthetic lethality screens with PI3K inhibitors to identify effective combination therapy in T-ALL. We
confirmed ten predicted combination therapies with small molecule inhibitors and the PI3K inhibitor GDC0941
with tubulin inhibitor Vincristine yields broad synergy in five cancer types and in our preclinical mouse trials in
vivo. The screens predict many metabolic targets, which remained unexplored.
 Our renewal focuses on understanding the connection between aberrant Ras-PI3K signals and cell
metabolism with the goal of resolving the developmental origin of T-ALL and testing new combination
therapies. We will determine the connections between Ras-PI3K signals and cell metabolism in our panel of 10
T-ALL cell lines by investigating six nutrient transporters (SLCs), identified in our screens (Aim 1). We will
obtain mechanistic understanding of the signals, metabolic features, and hematopoietic composition and
trajectories, as a function of leukemic Ras-PI3K signals with unprecedented resolution. We will continue efforts
on RoLoRiG/Mx1CRE and KRasG12D/Mx1CRE mouse models that display completely opposite phenotypes in
bone marrow stem cells (Aim 2). Lastly, we will obtain a comprehensive characterization of developmental-,
biochemical- and metabolic- programs in pediatric T-ALL with single cell resolution. We will combine these
efforts with preclinical trial to test the in vivo efficacy of PI3Kγ- and δ- inhibition, inhibition of SLC13A2 and
SLC25A44, and combinations in our T-ALL/NGS platform (Aim 3). The synergistic aims, metabolic insights,
new mouse models, patient sample-NSG pipeline, and innovative, single cell-resolution technology platforms
(CyTOF, SCENITH, phospho-flow) will allow us to make significant contributions towards molecular
understanding of T-ALL and precision medicine in cancer."
10748079,"BACKGROUND: Implementation science aims to improve the uptake of evidence-based health care practices
(EBPs) by defining the barriers that prevent their use, offering implementation strategies to overcome these
barriers, and developing methods that allow clinicians and researchers to choose the strategies that best ad-
dress the barriers they encounter. Recognizing that implementation strategy selection is often inefficient and
idiosyncratic, implementation experts have called for methods to make strategy selection scientific, data-
driven, and “precise”. To actualize “precision implementation”, there is a critical need to develop methods to 1)
quickly and uniformly identify implementation barriers and facilitators, 2) track the use and effectiveness of im-
plementation strategies, and 3) incorporate data and expert knowledge into the process of matching strategies
to barriers. Without these improvements, we risk perpetuating implementation failures and health care dispari-
ties. SIGNIFICANCE: Project OASIS (Optimize Approaches to Select Implementation Strategies) will support
VA in becoming a “high reliability organization,” that provides Veterans with access to equitable and high-qual-
ity care. The resulting methodological advancements are expected to apply outside of VA and across a wide
variety of evidence-to-practice gaps. INNOVATION & IMPACT: Project OASIS will engage tremendous interdis-
ciplinary expertise and data resources to address the complex, fundamental question of how to efficiently
measure and select strategies to promote equitable, high-quality care. This work will leverage a one-of-a-kind
dataset (38 project-years of implementation data) and techniques that are innovative in implementation science
(e.g., user-centered design, machine learning). Project OASIS will advance the science of precision implemen-
tation and our understanding of how to make decision aids that incorporate both machine learning and expert
opinion. This work will provide innovative and practical approaches that will support broader public health and
health equity goals. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) Develop and test an implementation strategy selection Decision Aid
(DA); 2) Develop and validate a survey to rapidly assess implementation barriers and facilitators; and 3) Refine
a survey to track implementation strategy use over time. METHODOLOGY: Aim 1) The DA will be based on
our existing, 38 project-years of data, that span 8 years, 12 EBPs, and 145 VA sites. We will first use Latent
Class Analysis to identify site “types” using existing data about site barriers and facilitators coded using the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)—a meta-framework of 39 constructs that can
help or hinder implementation. For each site type, we will use tree-based methods to identify which implemen-
tation strategies (based on the Evidence-Based Recommendations for Implementation Research, ERIC, taxon-
omy of 73 strategies) were associated with best performance on EBPs at the site-level. The empirical output
alongside existing expert opinion will form the backbone of a user-centered DA that recommends up to 5 strat-
egies which could help to address the barriers users are experiencing to EBP adoption in practice. We will con-
duct usability and acceptability testing of the DA followed by a hybrid type-III, cluster-randomized trial of the DA
vs. an existing, expert-only tool in 20 VA sites to improve liver cancer screening. Aim 2) We will work with CFIR
creators, clinicians, and Veterans to develop a refined, understandable, and relevant CFIR survey and evalu-
ate its psychometric properties with n=48 clinicians, comparing results to semi-structured interview data (the
traditional gold standard to collecting CFIR data). Aim 3) We will reconvene the ERIC developers and VA lead-
ers, clinicians, and Veterans to further develop a user-centered implementation strategy survey. NEXT STEPS
and IMPLEMENTATION: The Project OASIS DA and surveys are in high demand, as described in our letters
of support. These research products will be immediately used by VA leadership and researchers, shared on
the CFIR website—accessed nearly half a million times a year by a global audience—and posted on VA re-
search websites."
10892897,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 African Americans have the highest breast cancer mortality rate, highest incidence rate of early-onset
breast cancer, and highest incidence rate of triple-negative breast cancer in the U.S. More than 220
susceptibility loci for breast cancer have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), mainly
in population of European ancestry. Polygenic risk scores (PRS), which aggregate common genetic variants
identified by GWAS, have been developed to predict genetic risk of breast cancer for European ancestry
women and used in clinical practice, but the PRS for African American women has suboptimal accuracy.
Therefore, we propose a comprehensive analytical study that leverages several types of existing genetic
datasets for breast cancer available to us and in public domains to address three specific aims. First, we aim
to conduct cross-ancestry fine-mapping analysis to identify a credible set of causal variants in 237 breast
cancer susceptibility loci. Then we will develop parsimonious and robust PRS from the credible set of variants.
We have compiled and harmonized genetic data from breast cancer GWASs in women of African ancestry,
including 18,034 cases and 22,104 controls, and leverage the association results from European ancestry
(>133,000 cases and >291,000 controls) and Asian (>22,000 cases and >22,000 controls) populations.
Second, we aim to develop precise PRS using genome-wide data with several novel cross-ancestry statistical
methods. We will develop PRS models for overall breast cancer and its subtypes (estrogen receptor positive
and negative, and triple-negative breast cancer). Then we will validate the models generated in aims 1-2 in
independent datasets (>14,000 cases and >82,000 controls) from case-control studies, ongoing cohort studies,
and an ongoing risk-adaptive breast cancer screening trial. Third, we will integrate the best performed PRS
with existing risk prediction models that are based on non-genetic risk factors. The resulting absolute risk
models have a good potential to translate knowledge from GWAS to inform the practice of genetic counseling,
breast cancer screening and prevention for African Americans. It has good potential to advance racial equity in
breast cancer."
10751011,"Summary
Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the US, and, apart from physical therapy, therapeutic options to reduce
this burden are non-existent. Following a stroke, cell death and glial scarring leads to the formation of a non-
regenerative stroke cavity surrounded by the regenerative peri-infarct region. We are interested in understanding
how bioengineered therapeutics can synergize with pro-repair programs active in the peri-infarct region to
promote tissue regeneration in the stroke cavity and thereby improve neurological recovery. We have previously
engineered a dual-acting angiogenic hydrogel that, when injected into the stroke cavity, can reduce glial scarring
and promote vascularization to allow axonal infiltration. Although achieving brain repair in the stroke cavity is
remarkable, these results were achieved in young mice with un-impaired neuroplasticity. We believe that to bring this
technology closer to clinical translation, we must be able to show similar brain repair and behavioral improvement in more
clinically relevant animal models, like aged mice with decreased neuroplasticity. In this application, we aim to identify
our angiogenic hydrogel’s mechanism of action and optimize its formulation and to utilize this new formulation in
a stroke models with decreased neuroplasticity. The hydrogel is composed of hyaluronic acid functionalized with
cell-binding integrins and loaded with clustered vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and heparin
nanoparticles. Heparin is a known anti-inflammatory agent that potentially acts by breaking the inflammatory
cycle between macrophages and astrocytes following stroke. We will use design of experiment methodology to
determine the composition of these three factors (integrins, clustered VEGF, and heparin nanoparticles) that
leads to substantial brain repair (Aim 1) and assess how the hydrogel components modulate the pro-repair
environment by analyzing temporal changes in proteins, mRNA, and immune cell populations following stroke
(Aim 2). Using the improved formulation, we will also evaluate the angiogenic hydrogel’s ability to promote
neurological regeneration and functional recovery in more rigorous animal models, specifically aged mice treated
immediately following cerebral ischemia and young mice with cerebral ischemia treated as the plasticity window
is closing (Aim 3). Overall, we aim to deepen our understanding of how bioengineered therapeutics synergize
with endogenous pro-regenerative programs and thereby improve behavioral outcomes following stoke in more
difficult-to-treat cases."
10751012,"It is often assumed that lipid-anchored proteins non-specifically attach to membranes by the hydrophobic lipid-
modified moiety. We propose that it takes more than lipid-modification to productively organize lipid-anchored
proteins on target membranes. We will test this hypothesis using the Ras superfamily of lipid-anchored small
GTPases (laSGs) as model systems. The Ras superfamily consists of the Ras, Rho, Arf and Rab family of
molecular switches that mediate a wide variety of cellular processes controlling cell growth, motility and
trafficking. The structure of these proteins consists of a conserved catalytic domain, a flexible linker, and a lipid
anchor. Little is known about the precise roles of the intrinsically disordered linker region. By contrast, it is well
established that cycling between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound conformational states of the
catalytic domain regulate function. Disruption of this cycle by mutation or genetic defects causes many diseases
including cancer and developmental disorders. The proposed work will lay the foundation for the development
of effective therapies that directly target these proteins. Supported by strong preliminary data, we hypothesize
that monomeric laSGs engage membranes through one of the following mechanisms: (i) Those with a
moderately long (~20aa) flexible linker between the lipid-anchor and the G-domain adopt multiple distinct
orientations with respect to the membrane plane, with the catalytic domain ‘swinging’ and ‘rolling’ on the surface.
(ii) Those with a long flexible linker keep the G-domain distal from the membrane, with the long linker collapsing
on it as spaghetti would on a wall. (iii) Those with a short (and rigid) linker, such as GTP-bound Arf1, engage
membranes in a single orientation with the G-domain able to roll but not swing on the membrane surface. (iv)
The G-domain of dually lipid-anchored laSGs does not reorient. We will test these hypotheses using state-of-
the-art molecular simulations and simulation-guided experiments. In Aim 1 we will define the sequence and
structural determinants of membrane binding and reorientation of laSGs using atomistic molecular dynamics
simulations to map the conformational and energy landscapes of Rheb, RhoA, Rab11A and Arf1, representing
the Ras, Rho, Rab and Arf family proteins, respectively. In Aim 2, we will determine the functional roles of G-
domain membrane engagement and reorientation using mutations and cell signaling assays, confocal imaging,
electron microscopy (EM), and single molecule FRET in native lipid nanodiscs. Aim 3 will assess the impact of
G-domain membrane interaction and reorientation on the druggability of our model systems. The results will
elucidate the principles and structural regions responsible for the dynamic membrane interaction of laSGs and
define the determinants of their membrane reorientation, and potentially open up novel therapeutic opportunities
to treat many intractable diseases."
10751014,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project will devise experimentally and clinically validated computer models to elucidate the causal mecha-
nisms of leaflet thrombosis in bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs) following transcatheter or surgical aortic valve
replacement, and thereby improve risk stratification and device selection. Each year, nearly 300,000 aortic valve
replacements are performed worldwide to treat severe aortic valve stenosis, and the rate of valve replacement
is projected to exceed 850,000/year by 2050. Traditionally, surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) was the
gold standard for treating aortic valve stenosis; however, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has
emerged as an alternative to SAVR that has been demonstrated to provide outcomes comparable to SAVR for
elderly patients. Until recently, patients receiving aortic BHVs were thought to require limited anticoagulation, but
in the past few years, clinical studies have unexpectedly revealed high rates of subclinical leaflet thrombosis
(SLT) in BHVs after both SAVR and TAVR. SLT is associated with increased transient ischemic attacks and
strokes, has been shown to trigger acute myocardial infarction, and is suspected to accelerate structural valve
deterioration. Critically, SLT can progress to clinical valve thrombosis, which is a devastating complication. Wor-
ryingly, a very recent study on two-year data for the PARTNER 3 trial found a statistically significant increase in
valve thrombosis following TAVR compared to SAVR (2.6% post-TAVR vs. 0.7% post-SAVR, p=0.02).
Two mechanisms have been hypothesized for the increased early incidence of SLT in TAVR: 1) abnormal blood
flow patterns in the vicinity of the transcatheter aortic valve (TAV) (e.g., flow stasis, turbulence, paravalvular
leak) and 2) stent-crimp induced injury of the TAV leaflets, which activates coagulation and platelet deposition.
Although clinical imaging can detect SLT following aortic valve replacement, there is currently no approach to
predict which patients will develop SLT following either SAVR or TAVR. The goal of this project is to devise
patient-specific computational fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models of BHVs coupled to biochemically and
biophysically detailed thrombosis models to characterize the mechanisms that lead to leaflet thrombosis and,
ultimately, to predict leaflet thrombosis risk using clinical data in patients undergoing TAVR and SAVR. This
project promises to transform computation-based methods for AVR device selection and SLT risk assessment.
The project goals will be accomplished through three Specific Aims. Aim 1 focuses on experimental validation
of FSI models; Aim 2 studies mechanisms that lead to leaflet thrombosis after aortic valve replacement; and
Aim 3 focuses on clinical validation and device selection. Through these studies, a multidisciplinary team with
an established record of collaboration will integrate mathematical, computational, experimental, and clinical ap-
proaches to yield substantial innovation by establishing novel, rigorously validated models of flow, FSI, and
thrombosis post-AVR that will ultimately enable patient-specific SLT risk assessment. Further, because throm-
bosis are major challenges for many types of implanted devices, the project promises to have a broad impact."
10751015,"Our previous study of more than 10 thousand tumors across 33 cancer types identified over 800 germline
predisposition variants in both tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Although the impact of some of these
variants on cancer onset, incidence rate, and clonality have been documented, the effects of these variants
(especially when compared to somatic mutations) on molecular characteristics of cancer cells, contributions of
non-cancer cells having germline variants, and treatment responses, are far less studied. Our recent single
cell(sc) /single nucleus(sn) RNA-seq analyses of cancer samples provided comprehensive expression profiles
at a single cell resolution and revealed the expression of key cancer predisposition genes, such as BRCA 112,
VHL, BAP1, and c-MET in many non-cancer stromal and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME).
Our pilot analyses also revealed significant differential gene expression in cancer and non-cancer cells based
on the nature of the driver event being germline or somatic. We hypothesize that tumors with certain germline
predisposition variants in tumor suppressors and oncogenes may show differences in tumor progression and
treatment responses from those tumors with somatic mutations in the same genes due to differential
influence on mutational, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiles of the cancer cells and potentially distinctive
contributions from non-cancer cells having those germline changes. To take advantage of the considerable
progress over the last few years, namely newly accumulated cancer sequencing data, advances in single cell
omics, patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and tumor genetic models, we propose to test these hypotheses by
performing the following: compare germline predisposition variants and somatic mutations to dissect their
differential biological impacts and interactions using computational analysis (Aim 1); perform single
nucleus RNA-seq/ATAC-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and multiplex imaging analysis of human cancer
samples to reveal the differential roles of germline predisposition variants and somatic mutations in tumor
cells and the TME (Aim 2); use PDX and genetic cancer models to investigate potential functional
differences between germline predisposition variants and somatic mutations in tumor cells, TME, and
treatment responses (Aim 3). Results from this study will advance our understanding of the unique
contributions of germline variants to cancer cells and TME alike, improve genetic counseling and prognosis,
and provide guidance for differential treatment of tumors carrying germline variants vs somatic mutations in key
cancer driver genes."
10750943,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is an unusual picornavirus (genus Hepatovirus) that is released without lysis from infected
hepatocytes within small extracellular vesicles (EVs) resembling exosomes. These membrane-cloaked virions,
or `quasi-enveloped' HAV (eHAV), lack virus-encoded glycoprotein peplomers on their surface, yet they are
infectious and the only form of the virus found circulating in the blood of persons with acute hepatitis A. Numerous
other `non-enveloped' viruses have been found to be released from cells as quasi-enveloped virions in EVs of
varying size, making studies of eHAV relevant to a broad range of viral pathogens. This application proposes to
investigate two aspects of lipid metabolism found to be essential for productive hepatovirus infection in a
genome-wide forward genetic screen, and will test the following hypotheses: (i) that GD3 and possibly other
gangliosides play a crucial role in cellular entry and the initiation of infection by both naked HAV and quasi-
enveloped eHAV, by binding to and possibly triggering uncoating of the capsid within late endosomes or
endolysosomes, and (ii) that HAV-infected cells and quasi-enveloped eHAV virions are highly enriched in
sphingolipids with very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA, C≥22) tails, and that VLCFA synthesis is required for
efficient production and release of infectious eHAV. In Aim 1, exceptional lipidomics expertise will be brought to
bear on the question of which ganglioside species are necessary and sufficient for HAV and eHAV to enter cells
and initiate infection, and will define the carbohydrate headgroups and acyl tail structures that are optimal for
restoring the capacity of virus to infect CRISPR-derived ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG) knockout cells.
The proposed experiments will also determine the impact of UGCG knockout on endocytosis and intracellular
trafficking of HAV and eHAV, and the subcellular localization of exogenous gangliosides that restore the capacity
of virus to enter these cells and initiate infection. Aim 2 will identify which ganglioside classes bind specifically to
the naked HAV capsid, and whether ganglioside binding destabilizes its structure, lessening its thermostability
at neutral or acidic pH, as a surrogate measure of uncoating. Aim 3 will characterize the role played by VLCFA
in the hepatovirus lifecycle, and determine the degree to which VLCFA are enriched in infected cells, and in
eHAV virions versus non-viral exosomes, and whether VLCFA are required for the production and cellular
release of infectious eHAV, or for assembly of replication organelles involved in the synthesis of viral RNA.
Additional experiments will determine whether and how HAV infection upregulates VLCFA synthetic flux, and
whether this is essential for productive infection. By studying the role of lipids in hepatovirus replication, the
proposed research will address an unexplored and neglected facet of the pathobiology of this important human
pathogen."
10751046,"ABSTRACT
HIV-1-infected T cells can form stable conjugates with non-infected T cells in a process known as “virological
synapse” formation. This process is reminiscent of the formation of an “immunological synapse”, during which
CD4+ T cells rapidly polarize the actin cytoskeleton, the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC), and cytokine-
containing vesicles towards antigen-presenting cells. The polarization of CD4+ T cells during immunological
synapse formation depends on the RHO family GTPase CDC42, a molecular switch that has a key role in the
establishment of polarity in eukaryotic cells.
 We have now observed that CDC42 is critical for the efficient spreading of HIV-1 in several T cell lines
and in primary cells. However, our data also imply that CDC42 is dispensable for the completion of a single
cycle of replication. Together, our observations implicate CDC42 in the cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1.
 CDC42 stimulates the formation of membrane extensions, such as filopodia, through effectors that
mediate the polarization of the actin cytoskeleton, and HIV-1 can exploit filopodial bridges to spread from cell
to cell. Thus, our data let us to propose a working model in which CDC42 is crucial for the formation of
intercellular extensions that facilitate the transfer of HIV-1 between CD4+ T cells. In support of this model, we
have observed that CDC42 is required for the formation of HIV-1-induced membrane extensions by MOLT-3
cells. An alternative working model is that CDC42 is required for the polarized trafficking of HIV-1 virion
components to the virologic synapse.
 We propose to directly examine the roles of CDC42 in HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission and virological
synapse formation, and to determine whether HIV-1 regulates the activity of CDC42. We also propose to
examine the roles of CDC42 effectors that regulate localized actin assembly and polarized trafficking in HIV-1
spreading. Among these effectors are F-BAR proteins that connect to actin polymerization machinery, as does
the F-BAR protein PACSIN2, which we have recently implicated in the cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1.
Notably, our preliminary results indicate that certain CDC42 effectors, including the CDC42-regulated actin
polymerase FMNL1 and a putative CDC42 effector that controls polarized exocytosis, have crucial roles in
HIV-1 replication.
 The proposed studies have the potential to yield fundamental new insights into the mechanism of an
important but poorly understood mode of HIV-1 transmission. Of particular significance would be the
identification of a kinase downstream of CDC42 as being critical for HIV-1 spreading, since protein kinases
constitute one of the most important groups of drug targets."
10751047,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Ischemic stroke is a significant public health concern in the United States. Current therapeutic
approaches for stroke involve thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) or
endovascular treatments; however, many patients still experience disability. The goal of improving post-stroke
outcomes requires novel neuroprotective drugs for stroke treatment. While many such compounds have been
identified in preclinical stroke studies, none of these have been successfully translated to the clinic. In contrast,
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (i.e., statins) are routinely given to
stroke patients due to an inherent ability of these drugs to improve post-stroke functional outcomes.
 In this grant, we will test the mechanistic hypothesis that neuroprotection from statins results
from transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that is mediated by the critical uptake transporter
organic anion transporting polypeptide 1a4 (Oatp1a4). This hypothesis will be tested by two aims.
 Aim 1: To investigate CNS delivery of statins mediated by Oatp1a4 in ischemic stroke. To evaluate
the role of Oatp1a4 in CNS drug delivery during stroke, we will investigate Oatp1a4-mediated statin transport at
the BBB using the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model. In these studies, age-matched
male and female rats will be subjected to tMCAO for 90 min (Aim 1A). We will then demonstrate that Oatp1a4-
mediated statin delivery improves both biomarkers of neuroprotection and BBB integrity (Aim 1B). We will also
perform neurocognitive, sensorimotor, and motor performance studies (i.e., functional neurological tests) in
animals administered statins and subjected to tMCAO with reperfusion times of up to 21 days (Aim 1C). In all
studies, statins will be administered intravenously either at the time of reperfusion or after 2 h of reperfusion to
show that early administration of neuroprotective drugs can improve post-stroke outcomes.
 Aim 2: Transforming Growth Factor-b (TGF-b) signaling can be targeted to control Oatp1a4-
mediated CNS statin delivery in ischemic stroke. In these experiments, we will perform dose-response
studies and multiple-dosing experiments in age-matched male and female Sprague-Dawley rats using the TGF-
b/ALK1 agonist bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-9 and the TGF-b/ALK5 antagonist SB431542. We will study
the activation of specific Smad proteins that control TGF-b signaling in brain microvascular endothelial cells (Aim
2A). We will also determine the time course of Oatp1a4 expression and activity changes following BMP-9 or
SB431542 treatment and their effects on CNS delivery of statins (Aim 2B). Additionally, we will measure indices
of neuroprotection, markers of BBB protection, and neurological outcomes in rats subjected to tMCAO,
administered BMP-9 or SB431542, and injected intravenously with a statin (Aim 2C).
 Overall, these studies are clinically relevant because they will demonstrate the effective BBB
transport mechanisms are required to confer effectiveness of neuroprotective drugs in stroke."

supporting diverse students. It is an American Indian and Alaska Native-Serving Institution
(AIANSI) and was recognized as a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) in 2018. The goal of the
Initiatives for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD) program is to build our under-
represented (UR) students’ sense of belonging, self-efficacy and science identity. To meet this
goal, IMSD trainees enroll as a cohort in a one-unit success course in the first year, and engage
in individualized and cohort-based professional development and career readiness activities. UA
IMSD will utilize a new Annual Review to create a personalized academic and research plan for
each trainee and mentor. IMSD mentors will engage in inclusive mentoring workshops to
support their ability to work with their trainees. IMSD scholars are immersed in a tiered
mentoring system and receive support from the IMSD PI/Co-Is, staff, faculty, their dissertation
advisor, the Director of Graduate Studies of their program, and peer mentors. NIH funding will
be used to support program staff, first year student stipends, the success course, and
social/professional development opportunities. In recent years, IMSD has provided opportunities
to other UR biomedical sciences students who would benefit from the program. In this proposal,
we will create an engaged community of biomedical research scholars comprised of 12 NIH-
funded IMSD trainees and additional UR graduate students in the biomedical sciences.
Furthermore, IMSD leadership has been expanded to include campus leaders with faculty
appointments in diversity, administration, and education who will serve as mentors and role
models. We seek to develop IMSD trainees who will be scientists, researchers and leaders in
their field. Our goal is to be the premier institution in the Southwest for supporting diverse
students in the Biomedical Sciences."
10782813,"Here we propose a new Epigenetics, DNA repair and Genomics (EDGe) Training Program in Cancer to
support 4 pre-doctoral students per year. EDGe will take advantage of a thematic interest in the fields of DNA
repair and epigenomics and the intersection of these fields in the context of cancer to provide opportunities for
interdisciplinary training and interactions among students and dedicated training faculty. The UTHealth SA's
Integrated Biomedical Sciences (IBMS) graduate program is interdisciplinary; many students specialize in
cancer-related disciplines, including Cancer Biology, Biochemical Mechanisms in Medicine and Cell Biology,
and Genetics and Molecular Medicine. Within these three disciplines in particular, there is a strong interest in
both DNA repair and epigenetic control of transcription programs as it relates to cancer biology, though we will
not limit to these three disciplines. Another focus is the critically important interface of DNA repair, transcription
regulation, and chromatin organization to elucidate the basis of cancer development and identify potential
therapeutic strategies. This T32 training program takes advantage of faculty expertise (25+ experienced
mentors), a multi-disciplinary leadership structure, and the availability of a curriculum infrastructure of relevant
topics that can provide cross-disciplinary training in cancer biology for our next generation of cancer biologists.
The highly interactive faculty mentors bring training expertise in critical aspects of DNA repair and epigenetics,
from biochemical structure/function to cell biology, bioinformatics, and translational approaches. The first two
years of the IBMS graduate program includes completing two years of coursework, both general IBMS courses
and core discipline-specific courses. Students will be appointed to the proposed T32 for 2 years, after passing
their qualifying exam and following rigorous competitive evaluation and interview. As part of this EDGe Training
Program, we will require trainees to acquire cross-disciplinary training to strengthen their understanding of
cancer biology, DNA repair, and epigenetics, including cancer biology core courses and bioinformatics.
Trainees will also be required to take an institutional course on responsible conduct of research, be involved in
trainee-organized event planning, and participate in additional enrichment activities, such as the Texas-wide
Genome Instability Group seminar series. They will also be expected to participate in T32-specific meetings
comprising research-in-progress presentations and to attend the Mays Cancer Center's annual retreat. As a
minority-serving educational institute, diversity training is a major component of our program, seeking to
promote recruitment and retention of diverse students while working to enhance outcomes by increasing
competitive criteria for selection and augmenting mentoring. EDGe will be evaluated annually by an External
Advisory Committee and quarterly Executive Committee meetings. This T32 proposal has broad institutional
support, reflected by financial commitments from the Graduate School, the Long School of Medicine, the Mays
Cancer Center and the Office of the Vice President for Research."
10782884,"Project Summary/Abstract
Adverse events associated with injectable medications are estimated to impact millions of hospitalizations
annually with billions of dollars in associated costs and thousands of deaths. Drug administration errors are
the most frequently reported critical incidents in anesthesia with error rates for drug delivery events as high as
5-10% of all drugs given. Accidentally selecting the wrong syringe or vial, or giving an incorrect dose, are
common drug errors. Multiple solutions have been suggested to decrease these errors, however, most
solutions require additional steps prior to drug administration and provider compliance can be problematic. A
real-time auditory or visual feedback system that detects syringe handling by an anesthesia provider could
provide a virtual second set of eyes to check medications before mistakes occur.
This proposal seeks to obtain head-mounted high resolution video footage of anesthesiology providers.
Computer vision algorithms will be developed to identify syringes and vials in real-time. The central
hypothesis of this work is that machine learning algorithms operating from images obtained from a power
efficient camera can accurately identify medications before they are given to patients in the operating room and
generate an electronic medical record which is at least as accurate as current, manually generated tools. (1)
Determine reliability of drug label identification using machine learning tools. Build a database of 7,500-
15,000 syringe handling events obtained from head mounted cameras on 30 providers at two hospitals and
build real time machine learning algorithms to identify syringes, vials, and labels of commonly used anesthesia
medications optimized for timely, accurate identification. (2) Assess accuracy of automated drug delivery
dose calculations. Build volume analysis software to determine the volume of a drug administered as well as
identify the drug concentration to calculate dose. Compare timing and dosages from the manually produced
clinical record to those determined from the computer vision algorithm using the video footage as the true
value to determine the accuracy of each modality. (3) Design and test the feasibility of a power efficient
real-time wearable camera system. A low-cost camera system optimized for all day use with real-time
analysis capabilities will be constructed including two separate cameras, one low and one high resolution to
minimize battery consumption and thus overall device size and weight, recording in high resolution only when
the low-resolution camera detects syringe handling.
Through this K08 award the candidate will learn skills needed to be a leading expert in computer vision,
specifically, as it can be applied to patient safety in anesthesiology."
10932891,"Abstract
Infections caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTMs) are substantial clinical problems. The response to
therapy is disappointing and the goal for patients with chronic infections is generally to control rather than cure
infection. This means extended antibiotic treatment with drugs and associated toxicities that tend to accumulate
over time. While there has been considerable investment in developing new antibiotics for the treatment of
tuberculosis, caused by the related organism Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), most of these emergent
therapies have little or no activity in NTMs. This has made treatment of the rising number of NTM cases highly
problematic. Here we propose to use tools we have recently developed to study NTMs and identify mechanisms
to resensitize these pathogens to antibiotics to which they are intrinsically resistant. We will use a new tissue
culture model of lung infection together with genetic approaches to find and validate genes and pathways that
allow growth inhibition at achievable drug concentrations and/or more rapid killing by existing drugs and
advanced antibacterial compounds in Mycobacterium abscessus. We will then explore the underlying biologic
mechanisms of sensitization and extend these observations to an even more common cause of human infection,
organisms of the Mycobacterium avium complex. Our goal is to determine the therapeutic targets that will best
result in bacterial clearance even in the absence of effective host defenses."
10774196,"ABSTRACT
Cigarette smoking causes 480,000 premature deaths each year in the United States, of which 36% are due to
cancer. Two-thirds of smokers want to quit, but fewer than one-third make a quit attempt using an evidence-
based approach. Consequently, fewer than one in ten smokers report quitting successfully in the last year.
Comprehensive dissemination strategies are needed to increase utilization of evidence-based cessation
treatments and improve cessation among adult smokers. The vast majority (>70%) of smokers visit a primary
care physician (PCP) at least once per year. As such, primary care offers a ripe opportunity through which to
proactively deliver cessation treatment to adult smokers. All primary care practices that qualify for Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services reimbursement are required to maintain electronic health records (EHRs) with
coded smoking status data for adult patients. These data can be utilized to proactively identify smokers and
deliver treatment. Our team recently completed a pilot study to develop, refine, and preliminarily evaluate a
proactive asynchronous smoking cessation electronic visit (e-visit) delivered via the EHR. The goal of the e-visit
is to automate best practice guidelines for cessation treatment via primary care to ensure that all smokers receive
an evidence-based intervention. An initial baseline e-visit gathers information about smoking history and
motivation to quit, followed by an algorithm to determine the best FDA-approved cessation medication to
prescribe. A one-month follow-up e-visit assesses progress toward cessation. Clinical outcomes of our pilot
(N=51) were promising. At study end (three months), e-visit participants, relative to treatment as usual (TAU),
were 4.7 times more likely to have used a cessation medication, 4.1 times more likely to have reduced their
cigarettes per day by >50%, and 4.2 times more likely to report 7-day point prevalence abstinence. Feasibility
outcomes were similarly promising, with >85% of e-visit participants reporting that they found the e-visit easy to
use, would use an e-visit again, and trusted their provider with their care during the e-visit. We now propose a
Hybrid Type I effectiveness-implementation trial to comprehensively assess e-visit effectiveness relative to TAU
while simultaneously evaluating implementation when delivered across primary care settings. Effectiveness
outcomes will be assessed through 6-months of follow-up and include: 1) evidence-based cessation treatment
utilization, 2) reduction in cigarettes per day, and 3) biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence.
Implementation outcomes will be assessed at patient, provider, and organizational levels. This program of
research has the potential for broad and direct benefits to: 1) smokers, who will have increased treatment access,
2) PCPs, who can more efficiently treat smokers while also having an additional reimbursable service, and 3)
care systems, who can improve compliance with Joint Commission recommendations for cessation treatment."
10764854,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Peroxisome Biogenesis, Dynamics, and Degradation
 Peroxisomes are eukaryotic organelles that are essential for life in plants and metazoans.
Peroxisomes sequester various oxidative reactions, thereby enhancing metabolic efficiency while
protecting cytosolic constituents from oxidative damage. Although our knowledge about peroxisome
function and dysfunction is increasing, mechanistic understanding of how this critical organelle is
formed, maintained, and recycled remains incomplete. The proposed studies aim to fill these
knowledge gaps by tackling the following questions: How and where do peroxisomes originate? How
and why do intralumenal vesicles form within peroxisomes? How are proteins imported into the
organelle? How do peroxisomes interact with other organelles? How is peroxisomal quality control
enforced? These questions will be addressed using Arabidopsis thaliana; the unique peroxisomal
functions, small size, and facile genetics of this model allow straightforward modulation of
peroxisomal processes in an intact multicellular organism. Moreover, the relatively large size of plant
peroxisomes (compared to yeast and mammalian peroxisomes) offers exceptional opportunities to
decipher peroxisome biogenesis and membrane intricacies using live-cell imaging. The proposed
studies will train the next generation of scientists in cutting-edge genetic, biochemical, and cell
biological approaches and equip them to address fundamental cell biological questions.
 Peroxisomal defects underlie peroxisome biogenesis disorders, a group of inherited recessive
syndromes that are generally fatal in infancy or childhood and are characterized by wide-ranging
symptoms including poor growth, multi-organ dysfunctions, hearing and vision loss, and psychomotor
retardation. Peroxisome dysfunction also contributes to common age-related diseases (e.g.,
neurodegeneration, type 2 diabetes, hearing loss) that are exacerbated by oxidative stress. The
proposed studies will exploit unique aspects of plant peroxisomes while taking advantage of
knowledge from fungal and mammalian systems to provide insights that will likely apply to many
eukaryotes. Continued development of evolutionarily disparate systems with unique advantages for
elucidating peroxisome biology will advance hypotheses and mechanistic models to expand and
refine our understanding of this essential organelle."
10766203,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aminoglycosides are widely used to treat serious infections, as they have good activity against many multi-
drug resistant Gram-negative organisms. However, their strong and irreversible ototoxicity significantly limits
their clinical usage. The overall goal of this research is to investigate the pathological mechanisms underlying
AG ototoxicity and provide novel therapeutic targets to prevent it. We propose to investigate the functions of
aminoglycoside-binding proteins in hair cells, the sensory receptors in the inner ear. In our preliminary studies,
we have identified several proteins essential for aminoglycoside ototoxicity. Based on our preliminary data, we
hypothesize that a novel pathological mechanism is involved in aminoglycoside ototoxicity. To test our
hypothesis, we will: i) continue to investigate the expression, localization and functions of these proteins in hair
cells; ii) continue to characterize mouse lines carrying mutations in these genes; iii) continue to investigate the
functional interactions of these proteins in aminoglycoside ototoxicity. Our preliminary data show the feasibility
of our approach. We anticipate that our studies will shed new insights into the molecular mechanisms
underlying aminoglycoside ototoxicity and provide new leads for the development of new approaches to
prevent aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss."
10766217,"Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases and it is still on the rise with a prevalence of ~8% of the
U.S. population and an estimated cost of $82 billion/year. New therapeutic approaches are needed that offer the
potential for a long-lasting cure. Allergic asthma is the most common endotype and is thought to be driven in
large part by a type 2 airway immune response to inhaled allergens. Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are potent
suppressors of immune responses and are an attractive target to treat allergic asthma. The CD4+ T helper type
2 (Th2)-mediated response to environmental allergens that drives allergic asthma is thought to be due to an
imbalance between allergen-specific effector and regulatory responses. Recent studies by us and others have
demonstrated that resident memory (Trm) Th2 cells that reside in the lung are key effector cells that drive many
of the features of allergic asthma. Th2-Trm cells proliferate near airways following allergen challenge and are
responsible for inducing mucus metaplasia, airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway eosinophil activation. While
memory T cells were believed to continually re-circulate within the host, it has recently become clear that Trm
remain anatomically positioned to initiate antigen-specific immune responses at barrier surfaces. In preliminary
studies, we have now found that allergen-specific Tregs also reside in the lung following aeroallergen
sensitization and are the key cell that suppresses the Th2-Trm response. This has led us to the central
hypothesis of this proposal that resident (r) Treg suppression of Th2-Trm is key to regulating the allergic asthma
phenotype. Th2-Trm exhibit a distinct transcriptional program that includes the upregulation of the chemokine
receptors CCR8 and CXCR6. In preliminary studies, we have found rTregs in the lung also upregulate CCR8
and CXCR6 during a type 2 response. This has led us to hypothesize that the CCR8 and CXCR6 chemokine
systems play roles in the tissue residency programs of Tregs and their ability to be juxtaposed to Th2-Trm around
the airways. The central hypothesis of this proposal will also be explored in humans with allergic asthma. Our
group has investigated the response to bronchoscopic segmental allergen challenge in humans with allergic
asthma (AA) and allergic non-asthmatic controls (ANA). We found increased airway type 2 cytokine production,
total mucin, and mucin MUC5AC in response to allergen in AA compared to ANA subjects. These findings
suggest that differences in the activation of Th2-Trm within the airways may be critical for allergen-sensitized
individuals to develop the asthma phenotype. We will test the hypothesis that differences in relative frequency,
phenotype and/or TCR specificities of rTregs in the lung underly the differences in the response to aeroallergen
in ANA and AA subjects. Specifically, we propose to: (1) Further define the role of lung rTregs in suppressing
Th2-Trm; (2) Determine the role of the CCR8 and CXCR6 chemokine systems in the tissue residency program
positioning and function of rTregs in the allergic lung; and (3) Extend these studies to humans by comparing the
numbers, phenotype and TCR specificities of rTregs in AA and ANA subjects."
10765221,"SUMMARY
Background and key gaps in knowledge: Mitochondria serve as hubs coordinating diverse aspects of cellular
signaling, metabolism and inter-organelle dynamics. Our work during the ESI MIRA funding period has revealed
multiple roles for MCL-1, an anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein, in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology and cell
state. Detailed mechanistic studies are still needed to understand this most basic aspect of MCL-1 function. The
non-apoptotic function of MCL-1 converges and relies on the mitochondrial dynamics machinery. The dynamic
nature of the mitochondrial network determines the ability of this organelle to regulate a variety of cellular
processes that are tightly linked to cell fate and identity. Mitochondria coordinate these functions by coordinated
remodeling, as well as by the physical and functional interaction with other organelles, such as peroxisomes,
which also undergo remodeling to coordinate their function. The critical need for controlled mitochondrial and
peroxisomal morphology in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis is highlighted by the wide spectrum of
neurodevelopmental diseases associated with mutations in the regulators of organelle dynamics. We will
combine our expertise in organelle and stem cell biology with state-of-the-art approaches to uncover the
mechanisms by which mitochondrial and peroxisomal dynamics maintain neurogenesis.
Description of recent progress by PI: In pluripotent stem cells, we reported that MCL-1 is required for
maintaining an apoptotic priming state and pluripotency through its regulation of mitochondrial morphology
(Rasmussen et al., 2018). In differentiated cells, we found that MCL-1 is also required to maintain cell identity
(Rasmussen et al., 2020; Cleveland et al., 2021). This function which is shared with other members of the BCL-
2 family (Joshi et al., 2020) requires the fine-tuned coordination with the mitochondrial dynamics machinery
(Rasmussen et al., 2018 and 2020; Joshi et al., 2020). The fundamental role of organelle remodeling in driving
cell fate determination, led us to examine the impact of abnormal mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission on
neurogenesis (Baum et al., 2020; Robertson et al., 2022, Robertson et al., 2023 in press), using an iPSC-based
discovery platform optimized to study organelle biology (Romero-Morales et al., 2019, 2022a, 2022b).
Overview of future research program: We propose to build upon our findings from the ESI MIRA by taking a
multi-faceted approach aimed at three areas: 1) Continue elucidating how MCL1 controls stem cell identity and
differentiation by regulating mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism. 2) Modeling the contribution of
mitochondrial and/or peroxisomal fission to cellular transitions during neuronal differentiation. 3) Finally, we will
identify the metabolic switches that are engaged by mitochondrial and peroxisomal remodeling during neuronal
differentiation. Detailed elucidation of these mechanisms will reveal connections between organelle dynamics
and cell fate as well as the relationship of these processes to the neuronal dysfunction associated with rare
mitochondrial and peroxisomal diseases."

Despite remarkable advances in the past decade, contemporary chemical methods for C–H oxidation and C–H
functionalization still face significant challenges in achieving useful levels of selectivity on complex scaffolds.
While the oxidative enzymes that have evolved to perform these transformations in Nature are capable of
addressing these selectivity issues, their applications in complex molecule synthesis have been relatively limited.
Seeking to bridge this gap, our lab has developed new biocatalytic C–H functionalization tools and investigated
their applications in the chemoenzymatic syntheses of bioactive natural products. These tools are obtained from
initial biosynthetic studies on secondary metabolites, which to date have identified a suite of unique and
synthetically-useful enzymes to address unsolved C–H functionalization problems in organic chemistry. In turn,
these discoveries serve as useful starting points for further activity optimization through enzyme engineering and
for chemoenzymatic strategy development. Our chemoenzymatic syntheses are concise, step efficient and
readily amenable to scale, demonstrating their strategic advantages. Furthermore, our achievements in the last
funding period demonstrate that this strategy can be readily adapted for rapid analog generation to enable
subsequent mode of action identification and structure-activity relationship studies. The current proposal outlines
our long-term research program in the area of biocatalytic C–H functionalization with specific applications in
natural product synthesis. Projects proposed within the program include the development of chemoenzymatic
strategy to synthesize bioactive alkaloids and macrolides and explore their structure-activity relationships, the
development of new biocatalytic C–H functionalization methods beyond hydroxylation and the development of a
family-wide activity profiling for reaction with challenging substrates. Significant elements of innovation in this
work include (1) the discovery, functional annotation and biocatalytic exploration of previously uncharacterized
enzymes from various biosynthetic pathways, (2) the formulation of new chemoenzymatic strategies to access
precious bioactive compounds with unsurpassed levels of efficiency, and (3) the generation of novel structural
analogs for collaborative medicinal chemistry optimization and structure-activity relationship studies. More
generally, the proposed work will further stimulate the development of new logic in chemical synthesis centered
on the use of Nature's biocatalytic repertoire, radically altering the way chemists approach synthetic planning
and allowing new small molecules to be prepared in a more efficient and practical manner."
10745695,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cochlear implants (CIs), which directly stimulate the auditory nerve (AN), are widely considered to be the most
successful neuroprosthetic device. However, patients with CIs do not understand speech as well as people
with normal hearing, and there remains an unmet clinical need to improve performance in established CI users.
CIs are adjusted for each listener by varying the stimulus parameters on each electrode (“programming”);
however, programming techniques have largely remained unchanged since CIs were first approved by the
FDA in 1984. Studies have shown that 1) the estimated density of AN fibers affects speech recognition
outcomes in CI users, 2) AN density can be estimated at each electrode site in CI users, and 3) speech
recognition improves for some CI users when stimulating electrode sites with higher AN density. While these
studies show that speech recognition seems to be at least somewhat dependent on the ability of AN to
precisely code the signal, encoding of information at the level of the auditory cortex is also important for
adequate speech understanding. The present studies will define the role of AN density in the precise coding of
“timing” (temporal) information and quantify the extent to which stimulating electrodes with higher AN density
affects encoding of temporal information at the level of the auditory cortex. We hypothesize that users will
show improved speech understanding when using a CI program that stimulates electrodes with higher AN
density, but these improvements will be associated with more precise encoding of temporal cues within the
auditory cortex."

10745698,"During the process of tumor progression, melanoma cells must exit the epidermis to form a dermal tumor,
recruit lymphatic vessels, and then migrate to lymph nodes before metastasizing to distant organs.
Melanoma prognosis directly correlates with tumor depth and lymph node metastasis. Therefore, ideal
therapeutic agents for early stage melanoma would not only block melanoma invasion but also
prevent tumor cells from accessing lymphatic vessels. Published work from our group determined that
RhoJ, a gene that allows melanoma cells to resist BRAF oncogene-induced stress, is highly expressed in
melanoma tumors that metastasize to the lymph node. RhoJ deletion stalled the growth of BRAF mutant
melanoma tumors and inhibited the formation of BRAF mutant nevi in vivo. In addition to its selective role
in controlling the growth of BRAF mutant melanocytes, RhoJ plays a specific role in tumor angiogenesis.
RhoJ signaling in peritumoral endothelial cells induces them to generate vessels that serve as conduits for
both nutrients to enter tumors and metastasizing cells to exit tumors. Recent yet unpublished work
suggested that RhoJ deletion inhibited the ability of lymphatic endothelial cells to form vessels around
tumors. Moreover, small molecules that inhibit RhoJ signaling seemed to not only block the growth of
melanoma tumors in vivo, but also blocked the ability of endothelial cells to generate vessels to feed tumor
cells in vitro. Here we propose that RhoJ has a dual role in tumor biology- it acts within the melanocyte to
promote the formation of tumors and within the endothelial cells to promote the formation of lymphatic
vessels around tumors in the skin, and blood vessels around tumors in distant organs. We use a
combination of state of the art single cell genomics, in vivo imaging, novel pharmacologic agents, and
transgenic mouse models to: 1) determine how RhoJ acts in the melanocyte to promote the growth of early
stage tumors; 2) establish whether RhoJ acts in lymphatic endothelial cells to control tumor
lymphangiogenesis; 3) assess the relative contributions of RhoJ to tumor growth and
lymphanigogenesis/angiogenesis in vivo and in 3D models of human tumors. Completion of these studies
will define a new therapeutic strategy that halts cancer progression by simultaneously targeting both tumor
cells and the vessels that feed them."

Women represent the majority of people living with HIV in the world. Yet the underrepresentation of women in
HIV research persists despite them experiencing greater societal/social disparities of health (SSDoH) including
HIV care access and poorer HIV outcomes when compared to men. The coming together of substance
(ab)use, violence against women and girls (trauma), and AIDS/HIV (known as SAVA) in the context of SSDOH
contributes to excess HIV associated morbidity in women living with and at risk for HIV. This proposal aims to
improve HIV outcomes in women living with HIV (WLWH) by evaluating the effectiveness and implementation
of a combination intervention addressing substance use, trauma, and HIV.
We will employ a randomized Type1 Hybrid study evaluating the effectiveness of acceptance and commitment
therapy, exercise, and social support delivered by peer navigators. Implementation strategies that carry the
potential to address SSDoH (economic insecurity, limited healthcare access, limited community) that WLWH
experience and may enhance sustainability and dissemination will be evaluated. Community-based
organizations in four Ending the HIV Epidemic jurisdictions will employ the intervention for a total of 48 weeks
per site. The first 24 weeks (research effectiveness) will include a randomized study of 40 WLWH and will
evaluate the impact on HIV (ART adherence, % continuous viral suppression), substance use (days and
amount of use), trauma (trauma symptoms) and factors common to all three conditions (mood, social
disconnection) over time. Weeks 24-48 will include a research implementation phase guided by the
Exploration, Preparation, Implementation and Sustainment (EPIS) framework evaluating local barriers,
facilitators, change in implementation strategies selected to address structural/social disparities of health and
intervention adaptations using the the Framework for Recording Adaptations and Modifications-Enhanced
(FRAME). The following aims will guide evaluation of our intervention referred to as women focused
encounters for resilience, independence, strength and eudaimonia (WE RISE).
Aim 1: Evaluate short (week 8) and longer term (weeks 12, 24) effectiveness of WE RISE on HIV (↑ ART
adherence, ↑ % of participants with continuous viral suppression), trauma (↓ trauma symptoms), substance use
(↓ days of substance use) and transdiagnostic factors such as mood (↓depression, ↓anxiety) and social
connectedness.
Aim 2: Document the WE RISE implementation process by characterizing reach, effectiveness, adoption,
implementation and maintenance (RE-AIM) by site for 24 weeks.
Aim 3: At completion of 24 and 48 weeks, transcreate alternate or additional implementation strategies that
address local barriers and leverage facilitators to optimize the effectiveness, maintenance and broader
dissemination of WE RISE and document site-specific adaptations FRAME."

10757904,"Mutations in select mTOR pathway genes (MPG) are associated with megalencephaly (ME) and/or
hemimegalencephaly (HME) including MTOR (Smith-Kingsmore syndrome, ME), STRADA (Pretzel syndrome,
ME), PI3KCA (ME/HME), AKT3 (HME), PTEN (ME), DEPDC5 (HME) and RHEB (HME). Autosomal recessive
germline variants in KPTN (kaptin; 19q13.32), part of the mTOR regulatory KICSTOR complex, have been
recently identified in a clinical syndrome characterized by ME, intellectual disability, autism, and severe
epilepsy (Baple et al., 2014) among the Old Order Amish communities in Ohio and Pennsylvania and more
recently outside of the Plain Communities. There are 8 established pathogenic KPTN variants (loss of function)
all linked to the clinical syndrome Megalencephaly, Autism, Seizures Developmental Delay (KPTN/MASD).
The neurological phenotype includes hypotonia in infancy, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability (mild
to severe), and seizures (onset between 3 months-27 years). Seizures are typically refractory to standard
medical treatments and not amenable to resective surgery). ME is a universal feature of KPTN/MASD by
adulthood (orbitofrontal head circumference [OFC] >2 standard deviations for age, with OFC measurements up
to 5.4 SDS). Strikingly, serial OFC measurements available from 31 children, revealed that OFC is typically
within normal limits at birth, with a rapid increase in OFC within the first 2 years of life with ~75% of patients
with OFC >2 SDS by that age. Neuroimaging in a limited number of cases revealed a globally enlarged but
structurally normal brain. A Kptn -/- mouse strain was recently developed and now is under investigation in our
lab. Amazingly, Kptn-/- mice, but not Kptn +/- mice, also exhibit a ME phenotype with post-natal brain
overgrowth, thus mirroring the clinical KPTN/MASD phenotype. This application proposes 3 Aims to investigate
the mouse and human KPTN/MASD phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will define the effects of Kptn CRISPR/Cas9
KO in vitro on mTOR pathway activation, cell morphology, and cell motility and effects of mTOR pathway
inhibitors (mTORi) in murine neural progenitor cells and neurons. In Aim 2, we will analyze the Kptn -/- brain
including histopathology, mTOR signaling activation, and hyperexcitability (EEG), and response to mTORi. In
Aim 3 we will define the neurological phenotype of KPTN/MASD in an existing and prospectively collected
cohort of individuals within the Plain Community and in the general population. Because of the close
phenotypic overlap between the Kptn -/- mouse model and human KPTN/MASD, these studies provide a
unique opportunity to set the stage for an interventional clinical trial in KPTN/MASD to prevent brain
overgrowth."
10757906,"Project Abstract
A chronic inflammatory state is now considered a hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD) resulting from ongoing
hemolytic insult to the underlying vasculature and repeated cycles of vaso-occlusion crisis (VOC). Transfusions
remain a cornerstone treatment for patients with SCD, but unlike other transfused patient populations, a higher
proportion (20-50%) of patients with SCD develop alloantibodies with potentially life-threatening sequalae. These
include poorly understood delayed transfusion reactions (DHTRs) whose occurrence, as well as clinical
progression from mild to severe, is unpredictable. A long-standing interest of our research program has been to
understand the underling immune mechanisms leading to SCD complications including VOC and transfusion
complications. Our studies have uncovered an underappreciate role of circulating monocytes and the innate
immune response to hemolysis, a hallmark of SCD, in transfusion complications including alloimmunization and
DHTRs. Our projected studies as part of this R35 will be focused on innate immune cellular pathways that
magnify the inflammatory SCD state versus the cells' heme protective pathways such as the heme detoxifying
key enzyme heme oxygenase 1 in alloimmunization and in the development of DHTRs. Our laboratory has also
identified a novel function for a subset of circulating monocytes, referred to as patrolling monocytes (PMo), in
their ability to scavenge and remove damaged endothelium and endothelial-attached sickle RBCs. The discovery
of a novel mechanism of action of PMo in SCD offers a paradigm shift in our understanding of VOC and opens
up the possibility that PMos can be manipulated to prevent painful VOC. An objective of the proposed studies in
this R35 is to understand the mechanisms by which PMo protect SCD vasculature and how they are affected
both functionally and numerically during a vaso-occlusive event with the goal to help establish their role in VOC
pathophysiology, and their potential as a therapeutic target for VOC. As we have done in the past, all the
proposed studies for both objectives will combine the use of in vivo mouse models, in vitro human model
systems, and patient samples to mechanistically dissect in a rigorous manner how specific immune cell types
and molecular pathways contribute to SCD alloimmunization and VOC. Altogether, we believe that our
laboratory's approach of integrating studies in humans and experimental models to mechanistically dissect
immune pathways that regulate SCD complications is likely to be impactful and generate novel findings in areas
critical to the NHLBI scientific mission."
10758246,"DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS – ABSTRACT
Developmental Funds at KCI provide an important and essential source of funds in support of the Cancer 
Center’s investment in strategic initiatives. These initiatives are formalized through extensive planning and 
evaluation processes. During the past funding period, CCSG Developmental Funds were used in two key areas; 
1) the recruitment of a key investigator in a Program leadership role, and 2) support of strategic pilot projects. 
CCSG funds were significantly augmented by institutional support to further recruitment efforts and provide funds 
for pilot projects aligned with KCI’s strategic priorities. Specifically, during the current grant cycle (12/1/2015 to 
11/30/2019), $214,813 of CCSG Developmental Funds was augmented by an additional $14.8 million of 
institutional support to provide valuable support for 51 pilot projects consistent with the strategic vision of KCI 
and the recruitment of 36 new faculty, including 11 early stage investigators. The completed pilot projects have 
resulted in a five-fold return on investment measured by success in obtaining peer reviewed extramural funding.
Additionally, new faculty level scientists have published 226 peer reviewed articles, secured 59 grant awards,
and activated 129 clinical trials since their arrival. 
CCSG Developmental Funds in the amount of $55,550 are requested to fund pilot projects in the five areas of 
the Cancer Center’s focused future development. CCSG Developmental Funds, invested in pilot projects and 
augmented with institutional funding, have successfully driven innovative research and have led to extramurally 
funded projects over the course of the current grant cycle. This trend is expected to continue into the years to 
come, as KCI pursues the goals established in the strategic plan and engages with community partners to 
develop innovative projects that address the specific needs of the catchment area."

The Planning and Evaluation (P&E) Core of the Cancer Research and Education to Advance HealTh Equity
(CREATE) Partnership will implement a comprehensive, mixed-method, and outcome-oriented evaluation of all
CREATE’s activities and components. Using innovative evaluation methods that are integrated into all
Partnership components, the P&E Core addresses its overarching goal: To develop, implement, and sustain a
framework that drives rigorous ongoing evaluation to support the scientific and programmatic goals of the
Partnership. To accomplish this, the Partnership proposes the following Specific Aims: 1) Leverage existing
internal expertise within both institutions by engaging the Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) in internal
planning and assessing research, core, and shared resource activities; 2) Implement an innovative, efficient,
and rigorous mechanism for soliciting and evaluating new pilot projects and evaluating the progress of existing
Partnership-sponsored projects; 3) Utilize the external evaluation expertise, provided by highly experienced,
unbiased, multidisciplinary experts, of CREATEs Program Steering Committee (PSC) and Community Advisory
Board (CAB), to achieve the Partnerships stated goals and objectives; 4) Build and maintain a continuous
planning, evaluation, and tracking system using a approach to provide CREATE Partnership leadership with
metrics to make data driven decisions throughout all Partnership activities and components. To achieve P&E
Core aims, internal and external experts will be engaged including: 1) a collaborative Multiple Principal
Investigator group (MPI); 2) a larger Executive Committee made up of the MPIs, Program Managers, CREATE
Undergraduate Scholars Program director, Core and Shared Resource Leads, and an Evaluation Lead; 3) a
multidisciplinary IAC; 4) a PSC composed of external members with appropriate scientific expertise; and 5) an
external CAB made up of community partners organizations. CREATE MPIs will lead the planning component
and an evaluation lead will direct all evaluation efforts independently of the MPIs. The expected impact is to: 1)
advance cancer health equity in underserved communities in the Southern Border Region of California; 2)
further increase SDSU’s cancer research capacities, 3) expand SDSU’s and UCSD’s cancer health disparities
and community-engaged research, 4) build a pipeline of a diverse biomedical workforce, largely focused on
undergraduate, graduate and medical students and early stage investigators underrepresented in the
biomedical workforce. Based on the goals of the selected full and pilot projects included in this application,
CREATE expects major advancements in reducing disparities related to the following areas: 1) contribute to
the development of a novel therapeutic strategy to be tested in future clinical trials, 2) provide actionable
information to stakeholders, regarding inequity in cancer patient’s access to telehealth and; 3) generate a novel
multicomponent intervention that adapts care delivery to address reproductive health among rural and Hispanic
female adolescent and young adult cancer survivors."
10933458,"The United States (U.S.) has led the world in drug discovery for over 50 years. While this is a significant
accomplishment, U.S. drugs have been almost exclusively optimized and tested in non-Hispanic European-
Americans and been minimally evaluated in men- or women-of-color. As a result, drugs that work well in non-
Hispanic European-Americans (Anglos), may have unexpected toxicity or decreased efficacy in most of the
world’s population. Disparities in U.S. drug development occur throughout the entire drug discovery pipeline.
Only a small number of basic scientists are Latino/Hispanic- or African-American. Initial drug development and
optimization takes place in cell lines derived from Anglos. Less than 2% of physicians conducting clinical trials
are Latino/Hispanic- or African-American6. Most clinical trials participants are Anglos. Yet, new drugs are FDA
approved for Latinos/Hispanics- and African-Americans/Africans without sufficient testing. It is unacceptable that
drugs are developed by, and optimized for, only a fraction of our citizens. In this U54 partnership we aim to
develop the resources, infrastructure, and training to mentor the next generation of researchers that reflect the
diversity of our Catchment Area. Building on our successful P20 grant, here in this U54 partnership, UCR and
CoHCCC aim to develop the collaborations, resources, and training programs to reduce disparities in drug
development throughout the entire drug development pipeline. Our goal is for this program to become a focal
point for UCR and CoHCCC to mentor and train a diverse force of cancer biologists and address the disparities
in cancer therapeutics and drug development. Already, our P20 has fostered joint R01 grants, K01 grants, and
pre-/post-doctoral fellowships. Both institutions are highly committed - CoHCCC contributed over $800K to our
P20 grant and will contribute $250K/year to ensure the success of this U54 partnership. Aim 1 will strengthen
UCR’s cancer research capacity and develop the resources to increase UCR/CoHCCC’s ability to jointly develop
therapeutic agents optimized for the diverse populations in our catchment area. Aim 2 will increase the capacity
of UCR and CoHCCC to jointly develop drugs that target disparities in survival affecting the diverse individuals
living in our Southern California communities. Aim 3 will provide the training, opportunity, and mentorship to
ensure that the next generation of therapeutic scientists and clinical trialists reflect the diversity of Southern
California."
10761793,"SUMMARY
Blood vessels carry oxygen and nutrients and are vital to organismic viability and continued homeostasis.
Angiogenesis, or the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, is the predominant developmental
process by which blood vessel network density is regulated. During angiogenic development, endothelial cells
create a hollow cavity called a lumen, providing a continuous conduit for blood to reach distant tissues. The
mechanisms underpinning the morphodynamic changes in endothelial architecture and signaling leading to
vascular lumen formation, or tubulogenesis, are incompletely understood. In this proposal we will investigate a
protein called synaptotagmin-like protein 2 (sytl2) that we believe is responsible for deﬁning the luminal surface
by directing protein transport to the apical membrane during blood vessel development. Our preliminary data
suggests that sytl2 deﬁnes the apical membrane and tethers Rab GTPase proteins for delivery of vesicular
cargo, such as podocalyxin. In aim 1, we will characterize the role of sytl2a during vascular lumen formation in
developing zebraﬁsh embryos using a combination of live-imaging and CRISPR-based mutant generation. In
aim 2, we will comprehensively demonstrate that sylt2 works in combination with the GTPase Rab35 to deliver
podocalyxin to the apical plasma membrane during lumenogenesis in vitro. In aim 3, we will further
characterized how sytl2a interacts with Rab35 to deliver Podocalyxin using generation of new zebraﬁsh
reporter lines and compound mutants in vivo. How blood vessel lumen formation is regulated is still a major
question in the ﬁeld, this proposal will provide novel insight into critical mechanisms orchestrating this process."
10761733,"Project Summary/Abstract
Corneal ulcers caused by infection are causing blindness and visual impairment in 4.2 million people
worldwide annually and have been described as a “silent epidemic”. Corneal ulcers can be caused by several
different organisms, with those caused by fungi or Acanthamoeba parasites often associated with the worst
outcomes. Accurate and rapid diagnosis of the causative organism can prevent tissue damage leading to
blindness. But clinical outcomes are often poor because the first-line diagnostic method, slit lamp examination,
is often inaccurate, and the gold standard diagnostic method, microbiological testing, is time-consuming, prone
to false negatives, and resource-intensive.
We aim to develop a Portable In vivo Confocal Ophthalmoscope (PICO) that can provide accurate and
rapid diagnosis in corneal ulcers. We have established a research team of leading ophthalmology and
optical engineering experts to achieve this goal: In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) is the only clinically-
available imaging tool that can directly visualize causative organisms in the patient’s cornea. Dr. Jaya
Chidambaram (Co-I, University of Manchester, UK) led the first prospective study to test laser-scanning IVCM
in fungal and Acanthamoeba ulcer patients, which established high diagnostic sensitivity (86-88%) and
specificity (81-98%). Further studies by others demonstrated similarly high diagnostic accuracy. But
widespread adoption of IVCM has been hampered by the following weaknesses: 1) contact imaging, 2) limited
field of view (FOV) and speed, and 3) high device cost (>$75,000). While searching for a new approach to
overcome these weaknesses, Dr. Chidambaram began a collaboration with Dr. Dongkyun Kang (PI,
University of Arizona) in 2019. Dr. Kang’s team previously invented the world’s first smartphone-based,
portable IVCM device (cost = ~ $4,000), successfully imaged skin lesions from >350 patients in Uganda, and
demonstrated imaging of cellular details of the cornea with similar image quality to the commercial IVCM.
In this 3-year R01 project, we will further innovate our skin portable IVCM technology to develop a
PICO device that (1) enables non-contact corneal imaging, (2) increases the FOV 12 times and speed 8
times, and (3) reduces the device cost >10 times compared to the commercial corneal IVCM device. We will
develop a PICO prototype (Aim 1) and evaluate for corneal ulcer (fungal subtype) ex vivo (Aim 2).
We envision that PICO will become a standard corneal imaging tool worldwide, and will make significant
impacts on diagnosis and treatment monitoring of corneal ulcers and other major corneal diseases, including
dry eye disease, Fuch’s endothelial dystrophy, and corneal nerve evaluation to screen for peripheral
neuropathy in Parkinson’s disease and diabetes mellitus. Our proposal directly addresses several unmet
needs identified in the NEI’s strategic plan, including high-resolution imaging techniques to diagnose common
corneal disorders, and methods for early detection of corneal disease epidemics."

10932248,"ABSTRACT – FULL PROJECT 4 LUNG
Lung cancer is a prominent source of cancer health disparity, particularly in Black men. While they have lower
exposure to cigarette smoke, the most common risk factor for lung cancer, Black men have a 37% higher risk
for lung cancer than White men. In addition, the 5-year survival of Black men and women is below that of White
subjects. Numerous causes likely underlie these differences, including genetic differences. The latter may affect
the metabolism of nicotine/tobacco smoke components, responses to therapy, and differences in cancer driver
gene mutations. To understand the effects of the genetic differences between racial/ethnic groups on lung cancer
development and treatment, we need to characterize the driver mutations in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD, the
most common type of lung cancer) in Black Americans and develop in vitro lung cancer model systems that
reflect the relevant mutations in the correct genetic background. There is a notable lack of cell line models for
lung adenocarcinoma from Black Americans, with no Black cell lines from alveolar epithelial cells (the LUAD
progenitors) and only 5 known LUAD cell lines (compared to 67 White cell lines). While targeted therapies are
available for a subset of LUAD, in vitro systems to test therapeutics in Black Americans are sorely lacking. We
hypothesize that due to genetic differences, LUAD in Blacks will have a unique repertoire of cancer driver genes
and will respond to targeted therapies distinctly from white LUAD. This proposal represents an interdisciplinary
collaboration in which a medicinal (bio)chemist from FAMU (Dr. Lamango), a biomedical engineer from UF (Dr.
Huang), and a molecular geneticist from USC (Dr. Offringa) combine their innovative resources to tackle the
pronounced health disparities in lung cancer in Black Americans. We will do so through three Specific Aims: In
Aim 1, we will identify the main driver mutational signatures of lung adenocarcinoma from 100 Black Americans,
who are 5-fold underrepresented in mutational studies. In Aim 2, we will develop new immortalized alveolar and
lung adenocarcinoma cell lines from Black subjects and use these and existing cell lines to develop 2-
dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) in vitro models. We will test promising drugs (polyisoprenylated
cysteinyl amide inhibitors (PCAIs)) developed by the Lamango lab, that target the KRAS pathway which is
frequently mutated in LUAD. As time allows we will also test other targeted therapeutics and combinations of
drugs. In Aim 3 we will develop a novel 3D-printed bone cancer metastasis model to study the differential efficacy
of PCAIs and other targeted therapeutics on cancer cell cytotoxicity, migration, and invasion. Bone is the most
common metastatic site of LUAD. The three proposed Specific Aims address the lack of knowledge about cancer
driver genes in Black American lung adenocarcinoma, generate a collection of normal alveolar and lung
adenocarcinoma cell lines from Black subjects that will be used to establish race-appropriate models and will be
a great resource for others, and allow the testing of therapeutics on cells from Black Americans using 2D, 3D,
and bone metastasis models."
10766124,"Project Summary
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is common and often disabling. Currently, there are no pharmacologic
treatments for its core symptoms: impairment in social communication and restricted/repetitive behavior. The
high heritability of ASD suggests that understanding its genetic risk factors will help define ASD
pathophysiology and facilitate therapeutic development. The largest genetic risk factor for ASD on a population
level is common polygenic variation, the additive influence of thousands of small effect SNPs estimated with
GWAS. However, interpretation of polygenic risk is challenging: most disease-associated SNPs are non-
coding, the identity of their target gene(s) is uncertain, and their influence on gene expression is often
unknown. Thus, the genes and biological pathways affected by common polygenic risk for ASD remain poorly
defined. In contrast, recent studies of rare coding variation have associated >70 genes with ASD (“ASD
Genes”), which collectively highlight ASD-relevant biological processes. To define the biology of polygenic risk
for ASD, it is critically important to understand the degree to which polygenic risk converges with the genes
and pathways identified through rare variant studies. We propose to apply three novel statistical and
functional approaches to (a) interpret common polygenic risk for ASD and (b) assess the convergence
of common polygenic risk for ASD and ASD Genes. In Aim 1, we introduce the Stratified-polygenic
Transmission Disequilibrium Test (S-pTDT), which is powered to examine polygenic risk arising from small
regions of the genome. We will use S-pTDT to quantify the concentration of polygenic risk for ASD in and
around ASD Genes. In Aim 2, we introduce an approach to understand how polygenic risk influences gene
expression, leveraging a large single-nucleus transcriptomic dataset of adult human brain tissue. We will use
this approach to test the hypothesis that polygenic risk for ASD decreases expression of ASD Genes, and to
nominate candidate causal genes in genomic regions with heightened polygenic relevance in ASD. In Aim 3,
we introduce the Abstract Mediation Model (AMM), which quantifies the proportion of common-variant
heritability mediated by gene sets while accounting for uncertainty in the gene targets of non-coding SNPs. We
will apply AMM to estimate the extent to which polygenic risk for ASD is mediated by ASD Genes and other
ASD-relevant gene sets. These Aims will improve our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of ASD,
strengthen biological and therapeutic hypotheses, and generate methods applicable to other neuropsychiatric
conditions. Finally, this research training will occur in the stimulating environment of the Harvard/MIT MD/PhD
Program and Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Under the guidance of his sponsors, the fellowship PI will
complete five training goals that will create the foundation for a career as an NIH-funded physician-scientist."
10766126,"Project Summary
Muscle trauma is one of the most common and repetitive types of injury in humans. Owing to the
regenerative functions of Muscle Stem Cells (MuSCs), the injured myotome can fully regain its structural and
functional integrity within just a few days. In addition to this remarkable regenerative function, MuSCs also play
a significant role in the maintenance of muscle homeostasis under the normal condition. On the other hand, the
decline in MuSCs function is implicated in muscle wasting diseases and several forms of muscular
dystrophy. The functions of MuSCs are influenced by the niche it occupies. For example, the niche emits
signals to regulate MuSCs quiescence in the uninjured state, or activation when regeneration is required.
Understanding how these signaling pathways control quiescence and activation of MuSCs is essential to devise
the next generation of therapeutic approaches for diseases of MuSCs dysfunction. We recently described a
novel signaling pathway in MuSCs that stimulates regenerative myogenesis by epigenetically activating the
transcription of the Myog promoter. In this pathway, Per-Arnt-Sim domain Kinase (PASK) phosphorylates
WD40-domain repeat 5 (Wdr5) at the onset of the myogenesis program. Phosphorylated Wdr5 stimulates
the Myog transcription by inducing histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and the recruitment
of the MyoD transcription factor at the Myog promoter. We present evidence that PASK expression and activity
is induced in regenerating myoblasts by signaling cues such as insulin and nutrients in mTOR complex 1
dependent manner. Functionally, loss of Pask in mice retards regenerative myogenesis, and over-expression
of PASK depletes the stem cells. Thus, we hypothesize that PASK plays a role balancing self-renewal vs
differentiation during regeneration. Building upon these data, in this proposal, we will investigate how
PASK expression and activity is regulated in the regenerating myoblast (Specific Aim 1). In activated
MuSCs, PASK phosphorylated Wdr5 induces H3K4me3 modification, MyoD recruitment and nucleosomal
remodeling on the Myog promoter yet the mechanism is not clear. In Specific Aim 2, we will extensively
study two interacting partners of Wdr5 which could remodel the Myog promoter for its activation. Upon
induction of Myogenin, Pax7 expression is down-regulated and terminal differentiation is established. Since
PASK is an upstream regulator of the Myog expression, we are interested determining how loss or gain
of PASK affects the self-renewing population during regeneration and normal aging process, which we will
study in Specific Aim 3. Ultimately, these aims will allow us to understand how niche signaling cues control
the balance between self-renewal and differentiation and how it can be exploited for improvement of
physiological conditions such as sarcopenia."
10766129,"Description- Targeting Pneumococcal Transmission
The long-term goal of this project is a more comprehensive prevention of disease caused by
Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn, the pneumococcus). Our approach to the ongoing problem of the
pneumococcus is based on the lessons from 19 years of widespread childhood immunization, which
point to the critical need to interrupt host-to-host transmission if the incidence of Spn disease is to be
reduced further. This key step in the Spn lifecycle, however, has not been the focus of previous
investigation or vaccine discovery. This is because bacterial factors contributing to Spn contagion are
poorly understood due to the complexities of studying natural transmission and a lack of tractable animal
models. Our overall premise is that specific Spn genes contribute to its transmission and that their gene
products are potential novel targets for prevention. We recently developed an infant mouse model of
intra-litter spread that allows for the detailed study of the biology of Spn transmission. This model was
used to establish the role of the toxin, pneumolysin, in mucosal inflammation that increases secretions
that promote Spn shedding and facilitate its transmission. More recently, this model has been used to
screen a genomic library of Tn-seq mutants to identify the complete set of `transmission' genes from a
single isolate. Many of the `hits' encode enzymes that could function in binding to and degrading mucin
glycoproteins. These products to be characterized in Aim#1 could allow Spn to exit the colonized host
using mucus flow, then release itself from mucus entrapment to establish in a new host. Aim#2 will take
a separate approach by identifying Spn genes affecting natural transmission among strains circulating
within a community. This will be carried out with a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 3085
publicly-available whole genome sequences obtained from monthly nasal swabs of ~600 infants (Maela
cohort). Candidate genetic elements will then be tested/confirmed in the infant mouse model of
transmission. Our preliminary data using the infant mouse model recapitulates the experience from
pneumococcal immunization in that humoral immunity to Spn blocks transmission. The focus of Aim#3
is early-stage vaccine testing. We will use the infant mouse model to determine the potential for
conserved surface factors, including those identified in the Tn-seq and GWAS screens, to induce
immunity that interrupts host-to-host spread without the requirement for within-host protection. At the
conclusion of the project, we will understand how Spn promotes its transmission and whether
transmission can be targeted to mitigate the continued high burden of pneumococcal disease."
10766135,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal focuses on the challenge of identifying drug repositioning candidates for Alzheimer’s Disease. The
foundation of this work is the ReFRAME library, a set of ~13,000 compounds that includes nearly all small molecules that
have been FDA-approved, reached clinical development, or undergone significant preclinical profiling. The ReFRAME
library is being actively screened against a diverse cross-section of in vitro assays.
This proposal pursues three distinct strategies for identifying repositioning candidates among the ReFRAME collection.
First, we will create and mine a large and heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph. We will use machine learning
methods to identify repositioning candidates based on properties of the knowledge graph surrounding and joining each
drug and disease. Second, we will mine a massive data set of insurance claims data for associations between drug use
and the incidence or severity of Alzheimer’s Disease. Containing almost 7 billion medical claims and over 2 billion
pharmacy claims, this data set represents the largest source of claims data available. Third, we will use concept of gene
expression complementarity to identify repositioning candidates. We will generate a gene expression signature for
every ReFRAME compound in three cell lines relevant to Alzheimer’s Disease, and we will screen for compounds that
produce a signature that appear to reverse gene expression changes seen in Alzheimer’s Disease.
After assembling repositioning candidates identified through all three of these methods, we will prioritize up to 100
compounds (or compound combinations) for further characterization and validation. These follow-up experiments will
initially investigate the activity of these compounds in five cell-based assays to establish a mechanistic hypothesis on
their mechanism of action in Alzheimer’s Disease. Secondary follow-up experiments may include validation in some
combination of in vitro (including hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neurons and/or organoids) and in vivo systems.
We believe that the multifaceted approach described in this proposal offers the best possible chance at successfully
identifying AD repositioning candidates. Moreover, this work will create methods and resources that will be useful to
the broader scientific community, both for Alzheimer’s Disease and for other disease areas."
10767987,"Project Summary
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects almost one quarter of military Veterans seeking care from
Veterans Administration healthcare facilities. PTSD is associated with many health-related issues, especially
chronic musculoskeletal pain, and is increasingly considered a systemic disorder, affecting both mind and
body. Accessible treatments that address PTSD and chronic pain are urgently needed. Tai Chi is an ancient
Chinese exercise that uses an integrated mind-body approach to enhance quality of life. Tai Chi delivered in
groups has been shown to improve both mental health and physical health in patients with a variety of chronic
conditions. However, no studies to date have examined Tai Chi for PTSD and pain in Veterans. Since the
onset of COVID-19, interventions that can be delivered without the need for face-to-face contact are greatly
needed. Remote mind-body interventions delivered via videoconferencing platforms can reduce barriers to
treatment for Veterans isolated by PTSD-related avoidance, travel related challenges, or public health social
distancing restrictions. The proposed study will evaluate the feasibility of remotely delivered Tai Chi for PTSD
and pain in Veterans. This trial represents first steps toward a long-term goal of establishing this mind-body
treatment to address these maladies for Veterans via a remote videoconferencing platform. In Phase One, the
research team will adapt and do a ‘dry run’ of two existing 12-week, twice per week interventions (Tai Chi and
a Wellness control) for delivery via videoconferencing for the study population. In Phase One, the team will
recruit 12 participants (6 in each group) and utilize quantitative and qualitative feedback to refine and
standardize the interventions. In Phase Two, 36 participants will be randomly assigned over 3 cohorts (n = 12
for each cohort, n = 6 for each group) to either a Tai Chi or a Wellness group for 12 weeks with a three-month
post-treatment follow up assessment. The feasibility and acceptability of a remotely delivered randomized trial
of these two interventions and the assessment protocols will be determined. Feasibility will be quantified using
rates of participant eligibility, recruitment, attrition, and adherence to the treatment and assessment protocols.
Feasibility will be indicated (1) by the ability to meet recruitment goals, including women and minority
participation, and (2) by having at least 75% of participants regularly attend sessions and engage in home
practice and 70% complete post-intervention and follow-up assessments. Acceptability will be assessed via
participants’ ratings on a standardized measure of treatment satisfaction, supplemented by qualitative exit
interviews. Acceptability will be indicated by 70% of the participants reporting treatment satisfaction and
credibility. Information from this trial will be utilized to design a large randomized control study evaluating the
efficacy of Tai Chi for improving outcomes for Veterans with PTSD and chronic musculoskeletal pain. The
proposed study will be pivotal to establish procedures to fully evaluate a novel, accessible, nonpharmacologic
approach for symptom management of PTSD and chronic pain in a future large-scale trial of Tai Chi."
10767996,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One in five women over the age of 60 suffers from urgency incontinence, a condition associated with
depression, social isolation, physical function decline, and loss of ability to live independently. Currently, the
most commonly used treatments for urgency incontinence are anticholinergic medications designed to
suppress involuntary contractions of the bladder. Unfortunately, multiple observational studies have suggested
that anticholinergic bladder therapy may have adverse effects on cognition, based on higher rates of
diagnosed dementia in older patients prescribed these medications. As a result, there is widespread concern
that older incontinent patients who take anticholinergic medications in the hopes of improving their bladder
control may be exposing themselves to greater risk of functional compromise due to cognitive impairment.
To date, however, the data linking anticholinergic bladder medications with dementia are derived from
retrospective observational analyses rather than prospective trials. The few (and primarily industry-sponsored)
studies directly assessing cognitive function in older adults using anticholinergic bladder therapy have been
small and short and have used relatively insensitive cognitive screening measures, limiting their ability to
detect meaningful changes in cognition. While an alternate, non-anticholinergic medication for incontinence
(the beta-3-agonist drug mirabegron) is now available, very little research has compared the effects of this
medication to that of anticholinergic bladder therapy, and none has involved comparative prospective
assessments of cognition in older adults. In the absence of rigorous evidence of adverse cognitive effects,
anticholinergic bladder medications continue to be widely prescribed to older patients in the community,
including those with known cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, and related dementias.
To address this issue, we will conduct a rigorous, prospective, randomized study to evaluate extended
cognitive, urinary, and functional trajectories in ~270 older incontinent women without pre-existing dementia.
Women with frequent urgency incontinence and normal or mildly impaired cognitive function at baseline will be
assigned to receive standard anticholinergic, beta-3 agonist, or no pharmacologic treatment (placebo) in
addition to patient-directed, evidence-based information about behavioral management of incontinence. Over
1, 6, and 9 months, we will compare cognitive, urinary, and other functional and quality-of-life outcomes of
anticholinergic therapy in comparison to beta-3-agonist therapy and placebo. This research address the urgent
need for rigorous evidence to determine the effects of pharmacologic incontinence treatment strategies on both
cognitive impairment and incontinence, as two of the most common (and frequently comorbid) conditions that
cause older women to transition from living independently to entering long-term care facilities."
10904961,"Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bp) is the causative agent of melioidosis, a major cause of morbidity and
septic death in tropical/subtropical regions worldwide. It is particularly virulent in diabetic patients and is also
considered a Tier 1 select agent due to its potential use as a bioweapon. These bacteria are naturally resistant
to many antibiotics and there are currently no vaccines available. Thus, there is a great interest in identifying
targets for curative/preventative therapies. Like many human pathogens, Bp is adept at evading killing by
complement, a critical arm of innate immunity. Preliminary data generated by a co-investigator on this grant
showed that virulent Bp are very efficient at binding host Factor H (FH), a regulatory protein that inhibits C3
deposition, thus preventing complement activation on host cells. FH comprises 20 domains called short
consensus repeats (SCR), but only the four N-terminal SCR (SCR 1-4) possess complement inhibiting activity.
The ability to bind host FH, either via SCR6-7 or SCR18-20, is a common mechanism used by several pathogens
(now including Bp) to escape complement-mediated killing.
 Planet Biotechnology Inc (PBI) is developing therapeutic recombinant proteins containing specific FH
SCRs (those that bind to pathogens) fused to IgG Fc. In preliminary experiments we have shown that a construct
with IgG3 Fc N-terminal to SCR18-20 (Fc3/SCR(18-20)), promotes complement deposition and show potential
for mediating killing of Bp. The goal of this proposal is to further modify Fc3/SCR(18-20) to become more effective
at promoting direct killing, phagocyte uptake and killing of Bp, and potentially activating host cell cytoplasmic
killing pathways.
 We will start by producing variants of Fc3/SCR(19-20) with both short and long hinges, intended to
optimize either direct complement-mediated killing or opsonophagocytosis, respectively. We will also produce a
construct with Fc modifications intended to improve binding to the intracellular Fc receptor, TRIM21, and thus
enhance antibody-dependent intracellular neutralization (ADIN). We will purify and characterize sufficient
amounts of these new FH-Fc variants to be tested in vitro and in vivo against virulent strains of Bp.
 We will test the ability of the new Fc3/SCR(19-20) variants to: 1) bind to Bp, 2) promote C3 deposition
and membrane attack complexes (MAC) formation on Bp, 3) promote direct killing in the presence of serum, 4)
promote uptake and intracellular killing by macrophages and neutrophils, and 5) promote killing of Bp in mice if
administered either before or after infection, so as to significantly decrease the development of melioidosis.
 To evaluate potential activity of Fc3/SCR(19-20) against the “normal” intranasal flora, we will obtain
cultures representative of human nasal commensal (non-pathogenic) species from ATCC and evaluate their
sensitivity to killing by complement in the presence and absence of Fc-SCR(19-20). We will also evaluate the
ability of Fc-SCR(19-20) to enhance complement deposition on normal human erythrocytes."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia
in the elderly. Available AD treatment is unable to halt disease progression, highlighting the urgent need to
identify the potential etiology and pathobiology driving AD. The role of environmental risk factors in AD is
largely unexplored, although inhaled exposures, such as air pollution, have been implicated in AD.
Additionally, peripheral immune perturbation is associated with AD pathogenesis, including recent evidence
associating asthma, which has a pulmonary Th2 response, with increased AD risk. However, the underlying
mechanisms and environmental exposures culpable are unknown. Exposure to fungal bioaerosols in damp,
indoor environments is linked with respiratory diseases, such as asthma. Studies with small human cohorts
suggest fungal pollutants may impact cognition, while experimental studies in mice show neuroimmune and
memory changes. Our data demonstrate that exposure to live Aspergillus versicolor, a common filamentous
fungus associated with damp indoor environments and asthma, causes pulmonary inflammation and immune
cell infiltration indicative of a Th2 pulmonary response in mice, which we propose is culpable in how A.
versicolor affects the brain. Consistent with this premise, data also document neuroimmune changes with A.
versicolor inhalation, including elevated transcriptional markers of neuroinflammation in the frontal lobe and
changes in cortical microglia morphology. Importantly, data show that A. versicolor exposure increases beta
amyloid (Aβ) plaque number and augments dystrophic neurites in 5xFAD mice, demonstrating that A.
versicolor inhalation augments Aβ pathology, a hallmark of AD. Mechanistically, we found that A. versicolor
exposure changes the environment surrounding plaques in 5xFAD mice, causing lower levels of plaque
associated TREM2 and fewer plaque associated microglia, which are necessary for containing and clearing
plaques in AD. How A. versicolor inhalation affects the neuroimmune response during normal physiology and
during ongoing AD processes is unknown, but the Lung-Brain Axis hypothesis holds that the pulmonary
consequences of environmental exposures dysregulates the neuroimmune response through peripheral
immune cell changes and circulating factors to augment CNS disease. We observed that when A. versicolor
exposure augmented Aβ pathology, several circulating factors increased, including IL-5 and HMGB1. As such,
our AIMS are to explore the role of AIM1) IL-5, AIM2) HMGB1 and AIM3) TREM2 on A. versicolor-induced
pulmonary immune responses, neuroinflammation, and Aβ neuropathology. These findings will reveal key
mechanisms in the Th2 Lung- Brain Axis responsible for how the Th2 pulmonary response and A. versicolor
affect the brain and augment AD processes, creating critical opportunities to intervene and mitigate
neuropathology."

Mechanisms of protection from noise-induced hearing loss
ABSTRACT
The cellular and molecular bases underlying noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), the second leading cause of
hearing loss globally, are to date, not understood presenting a barrier to the prediction of risk, the prevention, and
ultimately the treatment of this debilitating disease. 1.1 billion young people (aged between 12-35 years) are at
risk of hearing loss due to exposure to noise in recreational settings. Among Service Members of Operation
Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, NIHL and its associated tinnitus are the top two diagnoses and
unaddressed hearing loss poses an annual global cost of $750 billion US dollars. Noise attenuation and hearing
aids currently represent the only measures for protection and treatment, respectively. It is now clear that cochlear
synaptic loss precedes hair cell loss at low-moderate noise exposures (nonexplosive) effectively silencing affected
neurons. Our laboratory and others have illuminated genetic mechanisms that modify sensitivity to NIHL in mice
and humans. Through mouse GWAS we have identified a critical gene, Prkag2 encoding the g2 subunit of the
AMPK complex. We find that damaging noise leads to nuclear AMPK activity specifically in inner hair cells and
that Prkag2 deficient mice are susceptible to NIHL due to greater instability of the inner hair cell presynaptic ribbon.
There is an urgent need to identify directed therapies aimed at the prevention and/or repair of cochlear damage
from noise exposure, for which an understanding of the underlying mechanisms is an obligate prerequisite. Toward
the long-term goal of developing targeted therapies for the prevention and/or correction of noise-induced
synaptopathy, we now seek to decipher the pathways and mechanisms linking nuclear AMPK activity in inner hair
cells to NIHL. Based upon our preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that AMPK becomes activated and
trapped in the nucleus of inner but not outer hair cells by intranuclear phosphorylation after noise exposure and
subsequently regulates the expression of downstream targets that impact the number and volume of presynaptic
ribbons. Using a combination of genetics, physiology, cell biology, biochemistry, and structural biology, we
propose the following three aims: the identification of cellular factors associated with susceptibility to NIHL (Aim
1), the molecular basis of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of AMPK (Aim 2), and the identification of additional factors
in the AMPK pathway leading to susceptibility to NIHL (Aim 3). As the AMPK pathway is fundamental to cell
survival, metabolism, gene regulation, and hearing, and is targetable, the completion of these aims has the
potential to lead to meaningful interventions for this debilitating condition."

What is the right way to investigate neuronal circuits? The dominant strategy in neuroscience is
to examine the relationships between stimuli, brain signals and behavior. In this framework, the
investigator is in a privileged situation. Because s/he has access to both brain patterns and
signals outside the brain, s/he can establish correlations between them. However, without
further ‘grounding’, it remains unknown whether these experimenter-observed correlations are
actually utilized by the brain. The present project will take an alternative approach by
investigating how neuronal population patterns in an upstream circuit are ‘read out’ by a
downstream observer circuit/mechanism in memory circuits. Using this strategy, we will
investigate how neuronal activity is transformed at each stage in the entorhinal cortex (EC) –
dentate gyrus (DG) – CA2/3 – CA1- neocortex loop, and relate such transformations to
behavior. The projects will combine large-scale electrophysiology, optogenetics and imaging in
behaving rodents. Project 1 will examine the distinct contributions of medial and lateral
entorhinal cortex (MEC, LEC) to spatial versus object learning, and will link behavior to EC-DG
transmission of theta-gamma oscillatory patterns. Project 2 will examine information
transmission within the dentate gyrus and across EC-DG-CA3 synapses. We will first quantify
changes in LFP and spike-LFP coupling to test the contributions of EC and DG granule cell
input to the firing patterns of DG mossy and CA3 pyramidal cells. We will then test whether DG
granule and mossy cell replay is coordinated with hippocampal sharp wave ripples or with EC
cell assemblies during post-experience sleep. Finally, we will test whether optogenetic
manipulation of dentate spikes affects memory and induces re-configuration of CA3 networks.
Project 3 examines whether distinct neuronal trajectories, such as forward and reversed
sequences, are read out differentially by target circuits in the CA3-CA1 and CA1-parietal cortical
circuits. Finally, Project 4 will test whether different hippocampal patterns are translated to
distinct neocortical functional maps and whether such maps are modified by learning. Our
‘reader-centric’ approach will establish how neuronal patterns are transformed in the entorhinal-
hippocampal-entorhinal loop, providing critical insights into physiological mechanisms of
learning and memory and relevant diseases."

10984933,"Insulin resistance is a common shared feature in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated
steatotic liver disease (MASLD), and recent studies have found that MASLD patients have almost 2-fold higher
rates of dementia than a matched cohort. Still, it remains unknown how MASLD impacts AD pathogenesis on a
mechanistic level. A key feature driving insulin resistance is inflammation in metabolic organs, involving
macrophages and pro-inflammatory cytokines that reduce glucose metabolism. Inflammation is also
characteristic of the AD brain, and our goal is to delineate the role of peripheral insulin resistance and
inflammation in the neurodegeneration of the aging brain. Our preliminary study found that mice lacking
interferon- (IFN) signaling in myeloid cells are rescued from obesity-mediated insulin resistance and
inflammation in the liver, suggesting a possible role for macrophage-derived factors in MASLD. Interleukin-12
(IL-12), a pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted by macrophages, is elevated in aging and obesity, and we made
a novel observation that IL-12 causes insulin resistance by impairing insulin signaling in the liver. Interestingly,
systemic loss of the IL-12 subunit has been shown to attenuate AD-like pathology and cognitive decline in the
APP/PS1 mice, a model of AD. Together, these data suggest that macrophages and cytokines are critical in
MASLD and AD. We will test whether insulin resistance and inflammation in the liver impact AD-relevant
neurodegeneration and whether liver macrophages and cytokines play a key role in this biology. Aim 1 will define
age-related changes in metabolism and inflammation in peripheral organs and the brain during AD-relevant
neurodegeneration in APP/PS1 mice. We will measure organ-specific metabolism using a hyperinsulinemic-
euglycemic clamp and labeled metabolites, analyze cellular inflammation using molecular approaches, including
MERFISH as a spatial transcriptomic approach, and correlate with AD-relevant phenotypes, including brain
plaque load, reactive gliosis, and learning and memory deficits. While descriptive in nature, the results will map
previously unknown connections between age-related metabolic and inflammatory events in the liver and similar
events in the brain, as necessary first steps toward subsequent mechanistic work. Aim 2 will delineate the liver-
brain connection by manipulating the macrophage IFN-IL12 axis to modulate inflammatory and metabolic
pathways in the liver and examine its impact on AD-relevant neurodegeneration. We will use a gain or loss-of-
function of IFN and IL-12 to test how modifying liver metabolism impacts AD pathologies in APP/PS1 mice.
These are critical studies to determine the impact of altered immunity and metabolism in the liver on
neurodegeneration, establishing a molecular link between metabolic liver disease and AD. Overall, our aims will
test a paradigm-shifting hypothesis that age-related liver insulin resistance and inflammation are causally linked
to AD-relevant neurodegeneration. In the process, we will identify macrophage signaling and cytokines as
potential therapeutic targets to treat MASLD, AD, and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases."
10768594,"Obesity, diabetes, and their pathological outcomes including cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and
others, are a major burden on the Veteran population and the VA health system. The overarching goal of our
research is to identify deleterious metabolic pathways linking obesity to downstream pathophysiology. Over
the duration of this project (started with the first Merit award in 2009) we have determined that obesity and
diabetes change sphingolipid metabolism linking obesity to deleterious outcomes in heart and liver. At the crux
of lipid metabolism and metabolic disease lies adipose tissue. Adipose tissue, while once thought to be an
inert energy storage depot, is now recognized to have endocrine properties that are blunted in obesity leading
to negative health outcomes, and it is also recognized that inflammation and over-expansion of adipose tissue
through adipocyte hypertrophy underlies much obesity-related pathophysiology.
 The complexity of adipose biology is continuing to emerge. In addition to the ‘white’ adipose tissue
depots that do in fact serve to store and release energy, adipose tissue can also be ‘brown’—these ‘brown’
depots are critical for thermoregulation in infants and rodents, and, until recently, were not thought to exist in
adult humans. Brown adipose tissue is beneficial for the organism as it uses fatty acids to generate heat, and it
is so metabolically active that its energy consumption can lower circulating glucose and triacylglycerols,
thereby improving metabolic health. Moreover, brown adipose also secretes beneficial hormones that
contribute to its positive effects. While brown adipose tissue depots in adult humans are small, it has recently
become apparent that white adipose tissue, i.e. abdominal and subcutaneous adipose, can be induced to a
brown-like state. Stimuli such as cold exposure, exercise, and adrenergic receptor stimulation can cause white
adipocytes to accrue brown-like properties. The plasticity of this so-called ‘beige’ adipose tissue is attractive
as a potential method by which to improve metabolic health. Glucocorticoids, widely used for various ailments
in the Veteran population, suppress thermogenic adipose, which may underlie the well known obesogenic
properties of glucocorticoid treatment.
 Molecular mechanisms by which white adipocytes convert to brown-like or ‘beige’ adipocytes remain
incompletely understood; however, we recently found that Sphingosine Kinase 1, a lipid kinase that generates
a class of lysophospholipids, is important for cold-induced browning. This proposal seeks to understand this
process and determine whether this pathway can be targeted to improve metabolic homeostasis by a series of
studies organized into 3 aims. Aim 1 will determine the molecular interactions that link Sphingosine Kinase 1
with browning of white adipose tissue. Aim 2 will test whether modulation of Sphingosine Kinase 1 can
suppress thermogenic function of bona-fide brown adipose tissue and whether this mediates the response to
dexamethasone. Aim 3 will examine the in vivo effects of modulating sphingolipid metabolism on overall
metabolic function. Accomplishing these aims will break new ground in sphingolipid and metabolic disease
research but will also extend our knowledge of how manipulating brown or beige adipose tissue can impact
human health."
10768595,"The skeleton, populated by large numbers of osteoblasts and osteocytes, requires a constant supply of
energy-rich molecules to fuel the synthesis, deposition, and mineralization of bone matrix during bone
modeling and remodeling. As a result, studies performed over the last decade have expanded our
understanding of the physiologic functions of bone beyond locomotion, mineral ion storage, and protection
of vital organs to now include the secretion of hormones that contribute to the regulation of whole-body
metabolism. Our previous studies suggest that sclerostin, an osteocyte-secreted factor that inhibits Wnt
signaling in bone, influences body composition and glucose homeostasis by augmenting adipocyte
differentiation. Preliminary studies suggest that sclerostin may exert its effect on adipose tissue in vivo by
modulating the sensitivity of adipocytes to -adrenergic signals that stimulate adipose tissue browning. In
this renewal application, we will utilize a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches to explore
the interaction between endocrine sclerostin and -adrenergic signaling. Our hypothesis predicts that
sclerostin deficiency leads to adipose tissue browning due to an increase in -adrenergic sensitivity; and
the loss of negative feedback inhibition since sclerostin gene expression appears to be responsive to
thermogenic signaling. Our approach will expand our understanding of the physiologic functions of
sclerostin; and help to determine if sclerostin neutralization, now approved for the treatment of
osteopenia/osteoporosis, can be leveraged to treat metabolic disorders like obesity and diabetes. We firmly
believe that the information gained from our studies will improve understanding of how the metabolic activity
of the skeleton impacts global metabolic activity. Such information is expected to significantly improve the
diagnosis, management, treatment, and prevention of the related metabolic disturbances of diabetes and
bone disease in aging Veterans."
10768684,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pathological changes in neural circuitry underly a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases including addiction and
depression. Accumulating evidence from human imaging, postmortem analysis, and animal models suggests
that atrophy of neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)—including the retraction of dendritic arbors, loss of
dendritic spines, and reduction in synapse density—plays a key role in the pathophysiology of substance use
disorders (SUDs). The PFC is well known to regulate limbic reward circuitry, modulate attention, and exert top-
down control over drug-seeking behavior, and thus, the atrophy of neurons in the PFC is believed to worsen
SUD by reducing executive control, exacerbating impulsivity, and leading to deficits in the extinction of drug-cue
memories. Therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring PFC structure/function are hypothesized to have broad
therapeutic potential for SUDs. Psychoplastogens—small molecules that activate TrkB signaling and serve as
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mimetics—are able to rapidly restore functional connectivity in the PFC
and produce long-lasting therapeutic effects after a single administration. However, the most prominent
psychoplastogens—including serotonergic psychedelics—all produce hallucinations, which greatly limit their
therapeutic potential. Recently, evidence has emerged suggesting that the hallucinogenic effects of these drugs
may not be necessary for their therapeutic properties, and the first non-hallucinogenic psychoplastogens were
introduced by our group this past year. One such molecule, known as tabernanthalog (TBG), produces both
rapid and sustained anti-addictive effects in rodent models of heroin self-administration, much like the known
anti-addictive psychedelic ibogaine. The advent of TBG represents an exciting new direction for the treatment
of addiction, but there is an urgent need to develop new assays enabling the rapid identification of TBG-like
molecules with optimized efficacy and safety profiles. Our overall objective is to develop high-throughput
methods for identifying non-hallucinogenic psychoplastogens that, like TBG, can produce long-lasting
therapeutic effects. To achieve this goal, we have developed psychLight—a genetically encoded, 5-HT2AR-
based biosensor capable of predicting both the hallucinogenic and psychoplastogenic properties of small
molecules. The proposed studies involve the use of this technology to rapidly identify new non-hallucinogenic
psychoplastogens for treating addiction as well as probing potential 5-HT2AR interactions with dopamine, opioid,
and cannabinoid receptors. We also propose studies to elucidate the molecular and circuit-level mechanisms of
the anti-addictive, non-hallucinogenic psychoplastogen TBG. Ultimately, the work described here will fill the gap
in our knowledge about how best to rapidly screen for non-hallucinogenic psychoplastogens, which will enable
the rational design of safer, non-hallucinogenic alternatives to psychedelics for treating SUDs and related co-
morbid diseases such as depression."

Heart transplantation is the optimal therapy for patients with irreversible, end-stage heart disease. However, a
several challenges remain to improve allograft and recipient survival. Immunosuppressive agents used to
prevent rejection have improved, but they still cannot consistently eliminate acute and chronic rejection, and they
are implicated in the pathogenesis of organ failure. New insights into how innate and adaptive immunity
contribute to rejection, identification of new therapeutic targets, and novel approaches to promote immune
tolerance are major unmet needs in transplantation. Early innate inflammatory responses in the organs (e.g.,
due to ischemia-reperfusion injuries) enhance acute and chronic heart allograft rejection. Integrins are
heterodimeric cell surface receptors involved in immune cell trafficking and signaling; therefore, they are
attractive targets to inhibit inflammation, including transplant rejection. The main goal of this project is to elucidate
the novel role of β3 integrin in regulating alloimmune responses via control of platelet- and T cell- mediated
immunity. Our ultimate objective is to develop new anti-β3 integrin-based strategies to promote engraftment. Our
data indicate that β3 integrin-/- mice (β3-/-) show significantly prolonged heart allograft survival in comparison to
wild-type (WT) mice, a finding that is associated with reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration into the grafts. We also
show that β3 is expressed by activated CD8+ T cells, and that the trafficking of T cells from β3-/- mice is impaired.
Notably, targeting β3 integrin also substantially reduces lesions typical of chronic rejection. The β3 subunit is
shared by the two integrin molecules, αVβ3 and αIIbβ3, which are expressed by T cells and platelets,
respectively. Based on extensive preliminary data, our specific hypothesis is that β3 on both cell types
contributes to rejection. In this proposal, we aim to define the relative roles of β3 integrins expressed on platelets
(in early promotion of inflammatory responses) and T cells (in enhancement of alloimmunity) in mediating
allograft rejection. Furthermore, our targeted delivery method of therapeutics usingnanoparticles (NPs) has
emerged as a promising method that increases efficacy and reduces side effects. Here, we have developed first-
in-class NPs for targeted delivery of cyclic RGD tripeptides (cRGD) to suppress β3 integrin- mediated recruitment
of platelets and T cells for early reduction of chronic rejection, using a murine model of heart transplantation. In
this proposal, we present three main aims to determine the roles of αIIbβ3 on platelets (Aim 1) and T cell-
expressed β3 (Aim 2) in regulating alloimmunity. In Aim 3, we will perfuse organs prior to transplantation with
NPs carrying cRGD to promote graft acceptance."

The Perlmutter Cancer Center (PCC) Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS), internally known as
the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC), reviews all cancer-related clinical research at PCC
and NYU Langone Health (NYULH). The objectives of the PRMC are to determine whether a protocol is
scientifically and statistically sound and to prioritize clinical research studies that are of the highest scientific
merit, particularly those that translate PCC science and address major cancer burdens and/or disparities in our
catchment area. The PRMC also evaluates whether research protocols compete with ongoing studies at PCC
and evaluates the likelihood of success of the work proposed. Scientific review is conducted through a two-stage
process for most protocols, with PCC Disease Management Groups (DMGs) providing the initial evaluation of
the scientific merit. The PRMC evaluates protocols after DMG review with the exception of investigator-initiated
trials (IITs), which have an additional review by the PCC Protocol Development and Monitoring Unit (PDMU) as
a quality control measure designed to enhance the chances of success for the protocol’s approval. The PRMC
also monitors ongoing clinical research studies for progress, reviewing IITs semi-annually and all other protocols
annually. The PRMC has the sole authority to terminate protocols that are not demonstrating appropriate
progress. PRMC review activities are coordinated with the actions of the NYU Langone Health (NYULH) IRB.
These two entities have distinct functions: the PRMC focuses on the evaluation of scientific merit and progress
of protocols, whereas the IRB evaluates protocols to ensure subject safety and address any ethical concerns.
Both work together to promote efficient activation of clinical trials. The PRMC ensures that all cancer-related

Perlmutter Cancer Center Shared Resources Management (PCCSRM) provides centralized oversight of the
eleven (11) Perlmutter Cancer Center Shared Resources (PCCSR): the Applied Bioinformatics Laboratories,
Biostatistics, Center for Biospecimen Research and Development, Experimental Pathology, Genome
Technology Center, Immune Monitoring Laboratory, Metabolomics Laboratory, Microscopy Laboratory,
Proteomics Resource Laboratory, Preclinical Imaging, and Rodent Genetic Engineering Laboratory. Each
PCCSR is led by a PCC Shared Resource Director (PCCSRD), all of whom are NYU Grossman School of
Medicine (NYUGSoM) faculty members, experts in their fields, and integral intellectual partners in Perlmutter
Cancer Center (PCC) research projects from experimental design to assay development to data analysis.
PCCSR deliver state-of-the-art services, develop and implement innovative methods and technologies, and are
highly integrated and collaborative, enabling projects that require coordination of diverse technologies. They are
heavily used by, and essential, to the four PCC Research Programs: nearly 70% (318) of all PCC publications
during this funding period used at least one PCCSR. PCCSR are institutional resources of NYUGSoM, are
supported by “chargeback” revenues and generous institutional subsidies and are tracked via a custom
dashboard and iLabs. From 2018-2022, institutional investment in PCCSR was $46,179,896. PCCSR are led
by Adriana Heguy, PhD, PCC Associate Director for Shared Resources. Heguy and her management team of
administrators and PCCSRD continually assess the needs of PCC Research Programs via surveys and advisory
board meetings. This oversight ensures that PCCSR services are high-quality and cost-effective, that access to
services is equitable, that each shared resource (SR) provides training in key technologies to PCC members
and their laboratories, that new SRs are developed when appropriate, and that underutilized or obsolete SRs
are closed. PCCSRM continuously plans for the acquisition and implementation of new technologies and
presents those plans to PCC and NYGSoM leadership to ensure continued investment in instrumentation and
infrastructure for PCCSR. The Specific Aims of PCCSRM are: 1) To provide centralized infrastructure to ensure
that all shared resources meet or exceed the expectations of investigators and support the multidisciplinary
research mission of PCC, 2) To develop and support transparent mechanisms that educate, engage, and train
PCC investigators in innovative technologies, experimental design, and ensuring data provenance, 3) To
promote and facilitate research collaborations between the four PCC Research Programs and support best
practices for data management and sharing for scientific rigor and transparency, and 4) To continuously assess
the service needs of PCC members and interact with PCC and NYUGSoM leadership to ensure continued
investment in instrumentation and infrastructure required to support basic, translational, and research"

10925342,"Project Summary
 It is predicted that 13.8 million US adults will live with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by 2050. Physical activity
(PA) is imperative to prevent or delay the onset of AD. However, adherence to the national PA guidelines
steeply declines after ages 60-65. Fewer than 20% of US older adults adhere to the national guidelines for
multicomponent PA - aerobic exercise (AE) at moderate intensity and strength training (ST). Thus, there is an
urgent need to promote multicomponent PA among low-active older adults. A major challenge to promoting
multicomponent PA is that most older adults experience a negative affective response to moderate-intensity
AE and ST. This negative affective response is a critical barrier to maintenance of regular PA because, in
general, people are unlikely to continue a behavior that results in immediate displeasure. Interestingly, listening
to music during acute bouts of AE and ST increases positive affect and reduces perceived exertion. However,
for these benefits to translate to long-term adherence, music alone is not sufficient. In a feasibility study
(N=33), walking-for-exercise with a sonically enhanced music playlist in the form of Rhythmic Auditory
Stimulation (RAS) – an application of pulsed, tempo-synchronous, auditory stimuli (e.g., beat-accented music)
for the facilitation of rhythmic body movement – nearly doubled the weekly volume of PA and caloric
expenditure in midlife-to-older patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation whereas standard music without RAS
had little effect on PA outcomes. To date, this proof-of-concept has not been fully tested and the underlying
psychological mechanisms of RAS remain unknown. Thus, we propose to test whether RAS enhances
affective responses to PA and thereby promotes long-term PA behaviors among older adults. In the R61 and
R33 phases, participants will undergo an exercise intervention (EX) consisting of ST for 3 days/week and brisk
walking for AE for >150 min/week over 6 months. The EX is designed to foster the independent maintenance
of regular PA through a gradual withdrawal of supervised training (3 days/week for 2 months, 1 day/week for 2
months, and unsupervised for 2 months). The independent variable will be random assignment into the EX
alone or EX+RAS. In the R61 phase, we will conduct an RCT to explore the preliminary effects of RAS on
affective and behavioral responses to the EX among non-demented, low-active, older adults (N=40) aged 65-
79 (Aim 1). Using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), we will test the hypothesis that adding RAS to the
EX leads to a more positive affective response to PA, lower perceived exertion, and greater weekly volumes of
PA over 6 months. Treatment adherence and satisfaction will be assessed to determine the acceptability of the
interventions. If milestones are met, we will proceed to the R33 phase and conduct a fully-powered RCT with
the same design and population (N=130). We will retest Aim 1 with this second larger sample and will assess
Aim 2 which is a test of the mechanistic hypothesis that the effects of RAS on the weekly volumes of PA are
mediated by positive affective response to PA and lower perceived exertion."
10767696,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders continue to have a major impact on global health. Physician scientists
have an important role in addressing these disorders through research whose findings can advance development
of new diagnostic, treatment, and prevention strategies. However, there is a decreasing number of physician
scientists in these clinical fields to meet this need. Strategies to recruit, train, and retain the next generation of
physician scientists to address heart, lung, and blood concerns are needed. The University of Alabama at
Birmingham (UAB) is committed to training and retaining a pipeline of physician scientists and has established
a Physician Scientist Development Office (PSDO) that provides support and resources for this pipeline, which
includes medical students. UAB’s 41-year long NHLBI T35-funded program has been highly successful in
providing mentored research and training for medical students. The goal of this renewal submission is to
continue to provide medical students with mentored research experiences concentrated in heart, lung, and/or
blood fields and didactics that provide skills and knowledge in translational research and motivation for a career
as a physician scientist. This goal will be achieved through three specific aims: Aim 1: Continue to identify and
recruit medical students interested in translational-based heart, lung and/or blood research who are diverse by
gender, race, and ethnicity. This will be achieved through multiple PSDO-led and co-sponsored activities held in
the first year of medical school (MS1). Aim 2: Continue to provide research experiences, mentoring, and
research training for medical students to promote curiosity in and motivation for a career involving heart, lung
and/or blood research. Each summer, 32 medical students will complete an 8-week program that includes: 1)
research experiences in heart, lung, and/or blood fields; 2) mentoring by preceptors with an excellent mentoring
track record; 3) translational research training and responsible conduct of research and reproducibility training;
4) other career development activities; and 5) career guidance through interactions with preceptors, the program
director (PD), peers and near pears. Aim 3: Maintain continued mentorship and engagement in career
development and research-related activities to retain medical students’ interest in and motivation for a physician
scientist pathway involving heart, lung, and/or blood research. As seen in program outcome data in this renewal
application, the program is very successful, with an increase in: 1) program applications (71% increase since
2014), 2) female and URiM participants (38% increase in females; 58% increase in URiMs), 3) longitudinal
research pathway participation (28% rise in year-out research programs); also, there are many publications (for
a short-term research experience) and many students continuing in academic medicine post-graduation. The
program remains successful, and its impact will be continued development of a diverse group of highly
motivated, well-trained, early physician scientists pursuing a career involving heart, lung, and/or blood research."
10769667,"SUMMARY – DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS
Developmental Funds (DEVFUNDs) have been essential in contributing to the Salk Cancer Center’s (SCC)
ability to achieve strategic and programmatic priorities in support of the Center’s vision. Historically, SCC has
been highly successful in using Developmental Funds to advance SCC goals, and these funds have yielded
significant return on investment in key areas. DEVFUNDs are used for two critical purposes, faculty recruitment
and pilot awards. In the current grant period, DEVFUNDs have been used to support the recruitment of three
exceptional new faculty and to support twelve SCC Pilot Awards. These efforts have infused the SCC with new,
cutting-edge research expertise and capabilities, accelerate innovative, and promoted collaborative research.
To maintain this momentum, in the upcoming grant period the SCC requests Developmental Funds for
transformative faculty recruitments and developmental pilot awards to advance key priorities outlined in the new
SCC Strategic Plan. These funds, coupled with substantial institutional investments, will accelerate SCC’s impact
in our community, our region, and the nation. SCC Pilot Awards fund innovative and high-quality basic and
translational research projects that have potential for creating new avenues of research and new collaborative
efforts. Emphases are placed on supporting: 1) collaborative projects, 2) early-stage investigators, and 3)
translational research. Importantly, SCC members have a strong track record of converting the preliminary data
generated from SCC Pilot Awards into external funding, including multi-PI awards. The SCC will issue an annual
solicitation for pilot project applications based on identified needs from EAB and membership feedback. Faculty
recruitment adds promising and productive scientists to the SCC and is key to growing and strengthening the
SCC Research Programs in key domains outline in the Strategic Plan. In the upcoming period, recruitment efforts
will be focused on faculty with expertise and proven track records in: 1) tumor heterogeneity and tumor evolution,
2) computational biology approaches to cancer initiation, progression, and/or drug resistance, and 3) a physician-
scientist with a track record in cancer cell therapy. A sharp focus will be maintained on recruiting diverse faculty.
Impact: DEVFUNDs add significant value to SCC research endeavors. During the current funding period,
DEVFUNDs were augmented by substantial institutional investments ($55.7M) to recruit new high-impact faculty
members, to support collaborative research (both within and between Research Programs), and to promote
translational efforts via collaborations with external clinicians. CCSG funds invested in faculty recruits ($483K)
and Pilot Awards ($910K) led to $26.2M ($10.0M and $16.0M, respectively) in external cancer-related total
funding, which represents an overall 19-fold return on total investment. Based on past and current successes,
Developmental Funds will continue to support rising cancer scientists (through recruitment) and cutting-edge
cancer research (through pilot awards) across the full spectrum of basic, preclinical, and translational science."
10769668,"PROJECT SUMMARY – LEADERSHIP, PLANNING, AND EVALUATION
At the Salk Cancer Center (SCC), overall responsibility for planning and evaluation rests with the Director,
Reuben Shaw, PhD, who sets the vision and strategic processes to intensify the growth and impact of SCC’s
cancer research, training, and community impact. Shaw transformed SCC’s Senior Leadership team in 2021
with well-defined roles and responsibilities, enhancing the culture of engagement, input, and continuous
improvement. He embarked on refreshing SCC internal and external advisory committees and creating new
ones. Internal advisory bodies currently include the Executive Committee (EC), Research Program Planning
Committee, Shared Resource Management Group (SRMG), Cancer Research Training & Education
Coordination (CRTEC) Committee, and Plan to Enhance Diversity (PED) Committee. The External Advisory
Board (EAB) plays an essential role in the planning and evaluation process and has been revitalized in the
current funding period. Informed by these committees, Senior Leaders led several evaluation and transformation
processes during this cycle, including: 1) development of a new SCC Strategic Plan ; 2) reassessment of SCC
membership to improve cancer focus; 3) restructuring of Research Programs to achieve the goals of the Strategic
Plan and foster transdisciplinary collaboration and impact; and 4) evaluation of Shared Resources.
Building upon the successes of the prior strategic plan and to catalyze further strategic growth, the Specific Aims
of Leadership, Planning, and Evaluation are:
Aim 1. To lead efforts to execute the SCC Strategic Plan (2023-2028)
Aim 2. To leverage the talent and multidisciplinary expertise of a strong, collaborative senior leadership team,
as well as feedback from SCC members, Institute stakeholders, and internal/external advisory groups, to ensure
continuous improvement and innovation within the SCC Research Programs, Shared Resources, education and
training activities, and diversity initiatives.
Aim 3. To lead efforts to develop and execute the next Strategic Plan (2028-2033), thereby ensuring continued
excellence of the SCC.
Impact: During the current grant period, these rigorous planning and evaluation mechanisms have promoted
cohesion in planning and communication, guided proactive decision-making and new investments, and ensured
close monitoring of progress and timely course-corrections to foster the significant achievements described in
this component of the CCSG application.
A major achievement during the current funding period was the recruitment of a diverse set of new faculty
colleagues in the current grant period, including three accomplished female assistant professors. Notably, four
of the six new junior faculty hires were women or from under-represented minority (URM) groups or both as
gender equality in SCC leadership continues to be a major focus."

The Salk Cancer Center (SCC) Shared Resources (SR) are dedicated research laboratories within the Salk
Institute that provide centralized access to instrumentation and services to meet the continuing research needs
of the SCC labs. They each occupy a shared-space environment that promotes interactions and collaborations
and are designed with a framework that allows expansion and evolution to stay at the cutting edge of technology
and meet the future needs of SCC researchers. Strong scientific and technical leadership is provided by the SR
directors and staff, who are readily available for high-level consultation and training for optimal experimental
design, data acquisition and interpretation to accelerate and optimize scientific discovery by SCC investigators.
CCSG funds are requested to continue to support the following shared resources: Advanced Biophotonics
(BPHO), Flow Cytometry (FCC), Integrative Genomics and Bioinformatics (IGC), Mass Spectrometry (MASS),
Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), Transgenics (TGC), and Viral Vector (VVC)
 The SR are managed by the Shared Resource Management Group (SRMG) appointed within the last year.
The SCC Deputy Director for Shared Resources (DD SR), Gerald ShadelGEA (appointed in June 2022) capably
leads this team, which provides effective oversight to the SRs. ShadelGEA is also the current (until 2024) Chair
of the Salk Institute Core & Infrastructure Committee (C&IC), an appointed faculty governance committee. This
provides critical SCC representation (the DD SR position is now a permanent, non-voting ex officio member) and
leadership (voting rights as Chair) on this institutional committee. The SMRG are also members of the SCC
Executive Leadership team, which ensures transparency regarding operations.
 Over the current funding period, the $4.2M budgeted funding for the SR from the CCSG was augmented by
$7.0M in Salk institutional operating support with strong return on investment as documented by usage metrics
and publications. In addition, during the same period, technologies that were added to the SR portfolio include a
Vizgen MerScope, Illumina sequencers, spatial transcriptomics technologies (IsoPlexis, NanoString GeoMx
DSP). In addition, through a partnership with Scripps Research, Salk invested in access to cryo-EM technology.
To support data management, investments in data storage and computation were also made. The capital
equipment investments over the past five years, funded largely by the Institute, represent an ~$8.5M investment.
In the current funding period, the CCSG annual budget contribution supporting the Shared Resources is $821K,
which is 18% of the annual average SR operating budget of $4.7M. The other 82% is provided by the institution,
other grants, and recharge funds. SCC requests $899,116 in annual support for the seven CCSG-funded Shared
Resources and Shared Resource Management personnel for the next funding period, which continue to be
leveraged by Institutional funds of $1.64M annually (25% of total operating expense)."

10769671,"PROJECT SUMMARY – FLOW CYTOMETRY
The Flow Cytometry Shared Resource (FCC) provides Salk investigators access to state-of-the-art flow
cytometry instrumentation, high quality services (ensuring that all samples are manipulated and analyzed
appropriately), and expert consultation concerning the design and implementation of flow-based experiments.
Flow cytometry is a powerful single-cell technique that is widely employed at the Salk Institute with 81% (25/31)
of Salk Cancer Center (SCC) members utilizing these services. This accounts for 83% of FCC total usage based
on recharges. Cell sorting is often used as an upstream mechanism for single-cell sequencing or cell implantation
studies, critical for cancer research and understanding complex tumor microenvironments and heterogeneity.
Multi-color analysis can be applied to a diverse array of disease models involving multiple cell types. In recent
years, advancements in instrumentation and fluorescence technologies have allowed complex experiments
involving more than 20 different labels to be utilized. The FCC offers two categories of flow cytometry
instruments: 1) instruments capable of sample purification (commonly referred to as “cell-sorters” or “sorters”),
and 2) analytical instruments. The staff fosters a collaborative environment, striving to provide an easily
accessible and comprehensive resource to the SCC, and dedicates effort to identify emerging flow technologies
or applications that will be useful for FCC users. The FCC strives to facilitate SCC research by: 1) Offering
instrumentation – FCC maintains a suite of instruments designed to meet the broad range of current and
anticipated needs of SCC scientists (based on research developments and trends) including critical cell-sorting
services. FCC staff provides high-quality, live cell-sorting services that are tailored to meet the varying needs of
SCC scientists. 2) Providing expertise – The highly experienced FCC staff is readily accessible to SCC
investigators for the collaborative development of assays and/or protocols. 3) Providing education, training, and

experimental design to data analysis. And 4) Identifying and evaluating new technologies – The FCC seeks to
continuously ensure that state of-the- art flow capabilities are offered, thereby maximizing user benefit."
10770453,"Project Summary/Abstract
Despite several new treatment options, many patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) continue
to suffer from poorly controlled disease. To enable the urgently needed development of better
therapies, the molecular mechanisms that underpin the pathogenesis of RA need to be better
understood. The newest hypothesis postulates that abnormally citrullinated proteins become
`neo'-self-antigens and stoke direct autoimmunity against this modified self. Key questions now
are why and how excessive and/or abnormal citrullination occurs in RA patients.
The research proposed here will provide novel insights into how pathological citrullination
occurs in RA patients. This work will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which the
citrullinating enzymes PAD2 and/or PAD4 act in triggering RA. This will, in turn, be invaluable
for evaluating them as drug targets, and will provide biomarker opportunities to monitor the
activity of the disease and possibly stratify RA patients into different subpopulations that may
require different therapies. The Specific Aims are:
AIM 1. The mechanism(s) of increased citrullination in RA patients.
AIM 2. A novel function of PAD4 in oxidative burst regulation.
The first Aim directly seeks evidence in patient samples of the five proposed mechanisms of
pathological citrullination to determine which are operational in vivo. Their contributions
individually, or in combinations, to protein citrullination of disease-relevant substrates,
including substrate mixtures and cells relevant to RA pathogenesis will be investigated.
The second Aim explores the discovery of a novel link between PAD4 and the cytosolic
components of the NADPH oxidase machinery (NOX2) in human neutrophils. The citrullination
of NOX2 components may contribute to the pathogenesis of RA by blocking a protective
oxidative burst response. The molecular details of PAD4 interaction with NOX2 will be
examined and the citrullination of specific arginine residues and the functional consequences of
these sites on the oxidative burst response tested, as this response has been reported to be
involved in tempering autoimmunity."
10770986,"Of the dozen or so solved structures of voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs), only those of a
weakly voltage-dependent Arabidopsis channel show the channel in its resting, de-activated
state. Structures of VGIC voltage sensors in their resting “down” position are lacking because
when solubilized in detergent or even reconstituted into nanodiscs, the absence of a membrane
potential always leaves the voltage sensors in an activated or inactivated-relaxed conformation.
In the proposed work innovative single-particle cryo-EM methods will be applied to obtain
structures VGIC proteins as reconstituted into lipid vesicles. In the previous funding period we have made many methodological advances and have progressed to the point of obtaining nanometer/sub-nanometer cryo-EM structures of the Kv1.2 wildtype and “paddle chimera” potassium channel constructs, reconstituted into vesicles. In
these structures no membrane potential is applied. We now propose to extend that work to
higher resolution and to the resting-state structure of Kv1.2, the best-understood mammalian
VGIC, by subjecting it to a large negative membrane potential. We will then acqure resting-state
and activated-state structures of the Nav1.7 sodium channel, which is of intense interest as a
central player and drug target in pain sensation. These structures will enable for the first time a
quantitative understanding of VGIC voltage sensing, and mechanisms of pain disorders due to
sodium channel mutations."

Oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) incidence is significantly increasing with most cases (~80%) caused by human
papillomavirus (HPV) infection type 16. The majority of OPC cases are diagnosed late and require intensive
chemo-radiation causing significant morbidity, life-long disabilities, and mortality. Early OPC detection is currently
the most viable secondary prevention approach with the potential to vastly improve outcomes for OPC patients.
We completed a series of studies focused on developing an oral gargle biomarker panel suitable for early OPC
detection that can be measured in a single oral gargle specimen, and can discriminate between early OPC (T1-
2 N0-1 [small tumors with a single ipsilateral node ≤3 cm]) cases and controls in two different case-control sets.
In a follow-up study the biomarker panel specificity and sensitivity was improved (AUC = 0.935) with a genome-
wide methylation array discovery approach. This resulted in panel expansion to include oral HPV 16 status and
13 differentially methylated host gene CpG sites. We are now poised to advance this oral gargle biomarker panel
to the second phase of biomarker development. We propose to leverage existing biorepositories of early OPC
cases and research infrastructure at two cancer centers to efficiently advance clinical assay development and
validation. Our goal is to validate a non-invasive diagnostic biomarker panel to detect OPC early. The central
hypothesis is that we can distinguish early OPC cases from cancer-free individuals using biomarkers related to
HPV and host epigenetic alterations, thereby identifying tumors that can be effectively and safely treated with a
single modality where survival is highest. As we are keenly aware that this is an evolving field, we will also
conduct preliminary evaluation of these and other biomarkers as the literature evolves. The Primary Aim is to
estimate the sensitivity and specificity of a combined HPV 16 DNA and host gene methylation oral biomarker
panel to distinguish early OPC cases from controls among 100 early and 100 late disease pre-treatment OPC
cases, and 200 controls matched by sex, age, race, and tobacco from the Moffitt Cancer Center and the UPMC
Hillman Cancer Center. Secondary Aims include assessing inter- and within-laboratory biomarker concordance
and reliability, factors associated with the biomarker panel separately among cases and controls, and the
performance of other differentially methylated host genes (e.g., SYNGR3) and/or oral tumor-tissue modified HPV
DNA to detect OPC early. This is an innovative approach to OPC early detection, using a non-invasive specimen
readily obtained (e.g., in routine dental practice). The approach builds on existing clinical/epidemiologic
infrastructure, well annotated biorepository and data from OPC cases and controls, and strong preliminary data.
Our research team has the experience and expertise to successfully implement the proposed study. Results will
inform the design of a large definitive prospective screening trial of a biomarker panel measured in a non-invasive
specimen among high-risk individuals to shift OPC diagnosis from late to early disease."

The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)'s overarching goal is to leverage technology to reduce skin
cancer mortality and morbidity. The ISIC Archive, created and led by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
since 2016, is the leading publicly available skin imaging repository. With >240 000 images, >6000 registered
users, and 17-21 million image downloads per month, the ISIC Archive has made major contributions to
dermatology teaching and the development of artificial intelligence (AI) for skin cancer diagnosis. ISIC has also
been central to the development and adoption of standards for skin imaging to promote quality and
interoperability. ISIC has hosted 5 machine learning Grand Challenges and hosts continuous Live Challenges
using ISIC Archive images. ISIC Challenges have attracted 6818 participants and 25 326 submissions. ISIC
has directly published 21 scientific papers, while another 260 peer reviewed papers and 3060 technical reports
have relied on ISIC data. Here, we propose to develop the ISIC Archive into an even greater resource for
research through major enhancements that focus on making the ISIC Archive fully compliant with FAIR
principles (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability), while expanding the Archive with additional
support for broadly used data formats (eg, Digital Communications Standards in Medicine [DICOM]) and skin
imaging modalities (clinical imaging, total body photography [TBP]). We propose to leverage ISIC's leadership
in the DICOM community to improve software support for established skin imaging standards, while publishing
new standards for TBP, and to improve quality and interoperability for these imaging modalities. We have
organized key milestones for this proposal under 4 specific aims: (1) to bring the ISIC Archive into rigorous
compliance with FAIR principles; (2) to overcome the challenges of ingesting and sharing clinical images and
representations of TBP while maintaining patient privacy and addressing sensitivity; (3) to strengthen the
interoperability of ISIC data through the use of DICOM; and (4) to implement approaches to facilitate scaling,
disseminating, and sustaining the ISIC data repository. The resulting ISIC Archive will be a more scientifically
robust, impactful, and sustainable resource. ISIC will continue to promote use of the Archive and engage the
dermatology and computer science communities through Challenges, workshops, and publications. By
promoting and supporting research to effectively leverage skin imaging and AI to diagnose skin cancer earlier
and more accurately, we will save lives and reduce the morbidity associated with unnecessary biopsies and
the treatment of advanced disease."
10770981,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Effects of Wound Dressing’s Vapor and Gas Permeability on Ischemic Ulcer
Healing
Ischemic PAD ulcers caused by arterial insufficiency of the lower extremities are extremely difficult to heal with
basic therapy and require special treatments. But even after the perfusion to the lower limbs is surgically restored,
the healing of severe ulcers remains a major medical problem due to the depth of the lesion, age and
inflammation-related changes in tissue regenerative capacity, and the tendency of the wound to become
infected. Secondary infection of ischemic ulcers is the main cause of lower limb amputations in patients with
PAD. To reduce the risk of infection, traditional therapies keep the wound as dry as possible using dressings
and topical agents that rapidly absorb exudate, but excessive drying complicates wound healing, especially
during a period when blood flow to the capillary bed is still compromised. There is a critical need to develop a
new dressing that protects the wound from infection while providing an optimal microenvironment for fast and
uncomplicated recovery of ischemic ulcers. We created a novel wound dressing made of biopolymer nanofibers
using electrospinning with a minimal concentration of synthetic fiber-forming additives and have tested it in
clinical trials treating II-degree thermal burns. Our dressing accelerated regeneration and prevented the growth
of pathogenic microflora in the wound. The material also has a high water vapor transmission rate and air
permeability, allowing free air access and removal of excess water vapor from the wound surface. In this
proposal, we will test the hypothesis that enhanced water vapor and gas permeability of nanofibrous wound
dressing (NWD) improves the healing of ischemic ulcers. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific
aims, whereby we will first quantify the effects of porosity, thickness, and average nanofiber diameter on the
permeability properties of NWDs. By altering the manufacturing parameters, we will produce NWDs with the
same chemical composition but different structures, allowing a range of permeabilities for gas and vapor.
Second, we will determine the influence of NWD permeability properties on ischemic wound healing in a
preclinical DOCA+high-cholesterol ischemic flap swine model. Ischemic wounds will be created as full-thickness
bipedicle cutaneous flaps with silicone sheeting to prevent reattachment and reperfusion. This will simulate the
conditions of poor blood supply to the wound, while DOCA and western diet will account for the hypertensive
inflammatory state typical for PAD patients. This project will demonstrate whether the wound healing process
can be improved by managing the water vapor and gas permeability of the wound dressing and help determine
the optimal NWD parameters for treating ischemic ulcers. The development of novel concepts for wound care
that provide fast and uncomplicated recovery of ischemic ulcers will have substantial economic, clinical, and
social impacts, reducing healthcare costs and providing a better quality of life for PAD patients. Importantly, it
will also allow the development of wound care materials for other types of chronic wounds, including venous,
diabetic foot, and pressure ulcers, that suffer from similar complications."

Infectious diseases remain the major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although
pathogens that have plagued humanity for years remain of great concern, emerging pathogens
have the potential to cause major disruptions in society. The study of infectious diseases,
including novel discoveries that can lead to prevention or cures, requires an in-depth
understanding of both the host and the pathogen. Scientifically, this means the study of host
responses to pathogens, which is the field of immunology, and pathogen strategies for causing
disease, which is part of the field of microbiology. However, historically, immunology and
microbiology research has proceeded to some degree along parallel paths. The intersection of
these two disciplines is absolutely essential for making progress in the fight against infectious
disease. This T32 Training Program, Immunology of Infectious Disease (IID), is designed to
bridge the gap between microbiology and immunology research as it applies to infectious disease.
Our goal is to train, mentor and support scientists working at the intersection of microbiology and
immunology. We have a strong and experienced training faculty from a wide range of departments
and schools at the University of Pittsburgh, with the unifying theme of research focused on the
immunology of infectious disease. The IID Training Program supports pre-doctoral students from
the Graduate Program in Microbiology and Immunology who are working in the laboratories of IID
training faculty. Post-doctoral scholars from the labs of the IID training faculty are eligible for
support.
This IID T32 training program is dedicated to developing a diverse and well-trained cadre of
scientists who are ready to take the next step in their careers to fulfill the broader scientific
enterprise. In addition to mentoring and training support, we will provide training in rigor and
reproducibility and responsible conduct of research and promote diversity within the training
program. This cross-department, cross-school, cross-discipline training program has been
successful for the past 15 years, and we have implemented changes to make it even more
successful with this renewal application. We are proud of our past success and seek to build on
these successes for the future."

Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, which include malignancies of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, colorectum,
small intestine, and liver, constitute the plurality of cancer deaths in the United States and worldwide. While
substantial progress has been made in delineating underlying molecular mechanisms with translation to
prevention, chemoprevention, early detection, prognosis, risk stratification, therapy, and survivorship, key gaps
remain in the biological underpinnings of the pathogenesis of GI cancers. Furthermore, in all GI cancers there
are disparities in treatment and outcomes that adversely impact under-represented populations, including
African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans. Given the complexity of the distinct etiologic and therapeutic
features of GI cancers, GI cancer research will remain a high priority for many years to come. Thus, there
remains a pressing need to train the next generation of scientists to conduct GI cancer research in an
innovative and productive manner. Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) and its NCI designated
Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC) has one of the largest groups of NIH/NCI funded
investigators working in GI cancers (i.e. “critical mass” of mentors). Additionally, the training program's faculty
mentors perform research across a spectrum of training disciplines, including basic science, translational
research, clinical and epidemiological studies, as well as bioinformatics. Building on this, we have developed a
rigorous postdoctoral training program with multiple unique features and strengths: 1) Focus on GI cancers. GI
cancers are responsible for the plurality of cancer deaths in the United States and worldwide, yet programs
aimed specifically at developing future investigators focused on GI cancers are lacking. 2) Breadth of training.
In addition to basic and translational science as well as clinical-epidemiological research methods, our program
includes training in bioinformatics that bridges basic/translational/clinical research, a unique aspect of NCI
training programs. 3) Commitment to promoting diversity. We have established a unique, collaborative program
with the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine to recruit predoctoral students to our postdoctoral training
program. In addition, we have developed extensive committed efforts, both specific to this program and
leveraging existing programs at our institution, to enhance and promote diversity of future GI cancer
researchers. The educational goal of the Program is to serve as the premier training site nationwide for
emerging researchers in GI cancers. The program aims to advance our understanding of GI cancers, with the
long-term goal of reducing the morbidity and mortality of these malignancies. Another important goal of our
program is to increase the diversity of future scientists engaged in GI cancer research. To achieve these goals,
we will identify and recruit a diverse pool of trainees, offer them a rigorous and individualized curriculum, and
provide them with research experience working with one of our numerous expert and experienced faculty
mentor investigators at Columbia University."

Opioid use among pregnant women is a growing public health concern in the United
States. Infants exposed to opioids in utero are at high risk of exhibiting Neonatal Opioid
Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS), a combination of physical withdrawal symptoms including
high pitched crying, sleeplessness, irritability, gastrointestinal distress, and in the worst
cases, seizures. The complexity of this syndrome is amplified by a variety of clinical factors
such as duration of maternal opioid exposure, maternal polypharmacy, environment, and
genetics. The complexity of in utero opioid exposure and NOWS make it very difficult to
investigate underlying molecular mechanisms that could ultimately inform early diagnosis
and treatment. Therefore, we have developed a much needed mouse model of 3-
trimester opioid exposure and withdrawal. Based on preliminary evidence, we hypothesize
that microglia activation and immune mediators contribute to the severity of NOWS and
a common SNP in the -opioid receptor modulates these effects. Using morphine as a
prototypical opioid, we will exploit our model to test these hypotheses. First we will fully
characterize the role of the innate immune system in NOWS and determine if regulation
of neuroinflammation has therapeutic potential by pharmacological treatment with the anti-
inflammatory drug, ibudilast. Second, as recent clinical findings suggest that genomic
variation in the gene that encodes the -opioid receptor (Oprm1 A118G) may influence
NOWS severity, we will use our mouse line that contains the equivalent Oprm1 A118G
SNP to determine the impact of Oprm1 genetics on microglia activation and immune
mediators. Using our model of 3-trimester opioid exposure and withdrawal we will use
TRAP-Seq, a new technology for retrieving mRNAs within the ribosomal complex that are
actively being translated, in our case in cells expressing m-opioid receptors, to interrogate
the changing transcriptome following opioid exposure and withdrawal. This project is likely
to have a sustained and powerful impact on the field because we will address
mechanisms through which perinatal exposure to opiates results in NOWS, and how
genetics and immune response contribute."

This renewal application seeks continued support for years 45-50 of the Washington University Training
Program in Immunology. This renewal application refines the training program to take opportunities to address
emerging needs and challenges in training of predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees. Washington University
School of Medicine (WUSM) has been a major center /magnet for both research and training in immunology
over many decades. The Immunology community at WUSM has achieved a world-recognized status, including
5 members of the National Academy of Sciences. It is characterized by a collaborative atmosphere that has
helped establish an excellent environment for training young Immunologists. This T32 training has been a
central component within this community, and has developed a symbiotic relationship that benefits the trainees
and mentors alike. In this renewal application, we have kept those parts that have historically worked
exceptionally well, and have also sought to address what we see as emerging challenges in obtaining a
training toward becoming a leader in immunology research. The needs we see are a result of the ever-
increasing amount of information, which has gradually led to a significant challenge for young trainees to
master, in the short time allotted before the pressures of independent research and discovery in mentor's lab
become the paramount motivation. Further, this application addresses questions from past reviews and refines
the distinction between activities of predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees supported by this T32 training
program and other trainees of the larger graduate program in immunology at WUSM. In this renewal, we have
seen this as a positive opportunity to revise the specific training provided by this T32, through our creation of a
new curriculum specifically tailored to providing a structured environment that ensures the trainee to obtain a
broad and in depth mastery of basic immunology. We are requesting the continuation of the 6 predoctoral and
4 postdoctoral trainee slots per year. This successful Training Program is thus producing the next generation of
basic and clinician scientists, whom we expect will elucidate the intricacies and mechanisms of our immune
system functions, and thereby help develop novel therapeutic strategies for multiple human diseases."
10771247,"Project Summary/Abstract
The clinical activities of oncogene targeted therapies are limited by the fact that a subset of residual cancer
cells often survive treatment, eventually giving rise to progressive, resistant disease that is very difficult to treat.
To date, relatively little is known about residual disease cells, in part because obtaining and analyzing tumor
specimens at this stage has been logistically challenging. We recently discovered that residual cells surviving
treatment with diverse, oncogene-matched targeted therapies exhibit DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and
consequent, ATM-dependent DSB repair. In mechanistic studies performed in EGFR mutant non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC), this DNA damage was observed to be driven by the counterintuitive “sublethal”
activation of executioner caspases 3 and 7, which drive DNA damage through their direct activation of
caspase-activated DNase (CAD). As a consequence, residual cancer cells that survive upfront EGFR inhibitor
treatment require ATM activity to resolve DSBs, and combining EGFR inhibitors with ATM inhibitors eradicates
residual cells, leading to highly penetrant and durable therapeutic responses in cellular and animal models.
These findings are further supported by our clinical observations that residual EGFR mutant lung tumors
display marked upregulation of ATM activity and that rare NSCLC patients whose tumors harbor loss-of-
function mutations in ATM exhibit increased progression-free survival on EGFR inhibitor therapy. In this
proposal, we describe studies to define the mechanisms driving sublethal caspase activation in residual tumor
cells and their consequent, ATM-dependent survival. Further, we propose to define the broad, functional
implications of sublethal caspase and ATM activation in residual tumor cells, revealing consequent mechanistic
vulnerabilities of residual tumors. Finally, we describe studies that integrate cellular, patient-derived xenograft,
and genetically engineered mouse models with highly credentialed, longitudinally sampled clinical specimens
to evaluate the therapeutic targeting of residual tumor cell survival. Together, these studies will define key,
distinguishing features of residual tumor cells, advancing our basic understanding of this critically important but
poorly understood aspect of tumor biology while defining a new class of mechanism-based strategies with the
potential to minimize residual disease."

rich domain for the discovery of disease-­modifying pharmacological approaches that are SMN-­independent and

mechanisms of motor neuron death through the identification and functional characterization of the downstream 
effectors of p53-­dependent  neurodegeneration in SMA (Aim 2). Lastly, we will leverage on the availability of a

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an infrequent but important cause of both acute and chronic liver disease.
The symptoms of DILI can be vague and non-specific, and may not appear until weeks or months after drug
administration. While most cases of DILI are mild and resolve by stopping the offending medication, in some
cases it can lead to liver failure requiring transplantation or death. Additionally, there are no drugs or therapies
that can reverse the liver damage caused by DILI. An estimated 22% of clinical trial failures and 32% of market
withdrawals of novel molecular entities are due to unanticipated hepatotoxicity. The combination of iPSC-
derived human liver organoids (HLOs) from DILI patients with organ-on-chip technology has the potential to
revolutionize DILI risk prediction and may ultimately lead to the development of safer and more effective
medications. We have established a biobank from 15 well-characterized U-M patients enrolled in DILIN along
with methods to engineer liver tissue that can recapitulate their specific disease phenotype to enable
mechanistic inquiry and establish improved animal-free methods for predicting DILI. We propose to fully
develop a next-generation DILI risk prediction platform to improve predictive accuracy and improve our
understanding of the etiopathogenesis and biomarkers of DILI due to specific drugs or HDS products. We
hypothesize that HLOs from diverse DILI patients will provide a novel and scalable platform for risk prediction
and mechanistic inquiry. We will test this hypothesis with three Specific Aims: (1) expand DILI patient biobank
through more patient enrollment to enhance the ethnic and gender diversity and the number of culprit drugs to
characterize more mechanisms of DILI, (2) increase the model complexity by incorporating additional liver cell
types including same-patient immune cells, cholangiocytes, and an endothelial barrier that will be more
physiologically active to enable high accuracy in retrospective prediction of the culprit drug, (3) perform state-
of-the-art single-cell mechanistic studies involving selected drugs including amoxicillin-clavulanate and link
genotype and transcriptional profiles to cellular phenotypes following drug exposure. The top identified targets
will be validated by CRISPR genome editing, functional assessment, and differential hepatotoxicity for DILI

The objective of the University of Pennsylvania Post-Baccalaureate Research and Education
Program (PennPREP) is to guide recent college graduates from underrepresented groups (UR)
into graduate school to pursue biomedical research. Twelve UR scholars are identified each year
who are interested in biomedical research but lack experience or expertise necessary for graduate
school training. Each scholar is matched with a research mentor among the graduate training
faculty and provided with a one-year (possibly two year) intensive research project. Individual
Development Plans are developed for each scholar to ensure their engage in research and
professional development activities are appropriate to their scientific interests, needs, and goals,
including graduate or advanced undergraduate coursework. Scholars develop skills necessary
for success in graduate school by completing workshops in biostatistics, safe and responsible
conduct of research, scientific rigor and reproducibility, critical analysis of scientific literature, and
oral and written presentation skills. Scholars meet weekly as a group to discuss scientific journal
articles and their own research to further develop skills in the critical evaluation of research and
scientific presentations, as well as to increase exposure to research outside their own laboratory.
Scholars receive advising for the graduate school application process, including selecting
programs, writing application essays, and interview practice. Support is provided for GRE or
MCAT preparation courses, as needed. To establish professional networks, scholars meet with
Penn faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, among them PREP alumni, who share
their experience, research, and academic path. A regional PREP Symposium is held annually
with partner PREP programs to provide additional research exposure and networking
opportunities. Scholars attend at least one national conference per year, such as ABRCMS, and
SACNAS, to present their research, broaden exposure and establish networks. Scholars are
encouraged to join and participate in graduate student groups to build community and identify
scientific role models. Mechanisms are in place for measuring the effectiveness of the program
components and to improve the training experience over time. The ultimate measure of program
success is the admission of PREP scholars to PhD or MD-PhD training programs and the pursuit
a research career. Over the past 18 years, 81% (94/116) of scholars completing PREP were
admitted to PhD or MD-PhD programs, with 31% (7/22) of those remaining seeking MD or other
professional health degrees. Currently, 42 scholars are enrolled in PhD or MD-PhD training, with
38 completing such degrees and moving on to careers related to biomedical research."

The central nervous system (CNS), comprised of the brain, spinal cord and retina, is the most
vascularized organ system in the human body. Neurons and glial cells closely contact blood
vessels and communicate with vascular endothelial cells and pericytes to control normal CNS
development and physiology. Blood vessel dysfunction occurs in multiple CNS diseases,
including developmental brain disorders, retinal deficits, and age-related neurodegeneration.
We understand surprisingly little about mechanisms that regulate normal CNS vascular
development and physiology or how these events go awry during disease pathogenesis. To
characterize new and potentially targetable factors that control blood vessel morphogenesis in
the developing CNS, we queried open-source databases to identify genes with putative roles in
vascular endothelial cell growth, differentiation and sprouting. These efforts have led to the
current project focused on Prnd, a member of the prion gene family that is expressed in the
CNS vascular endothelium. We present a substantial amount of data that bolster our working
hypothesis that glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked Prnd activates endothelial cell signaling
pathways to regulate angiogenesis and blood vessel permeability in the brain and retina.
Furthermore, we propose that abnormal Prnd expression and function contributes to brain and
retinal blood vessel pathologies. To test our hypotheses, we will (1) utilize biochemical
strategies and high-resolution cell imaging methods to analyze Prnd-dependent signaling
pathways that promote endothelial cell differentiation, growth and migration; (2) analyze roles
for Prnd in developmental and pathological CNS angiogenesis; and (3) identify and characterize
cues in the CNS microenvironment that promote Prnd expression and functions in angiogenic
endothelial cells. In summary, these experiments will reveal novel functions for Prnd in
regulating CNS blood vessel morphogenesis and may identify new targets for therapeutically
inhibiting pathological angiogenesis in the CNS."

The overarching goal of this study is to measure the prevalence of cancer misinformation on social media and
understand the mechanisms that underlies its spread. Belief in misinformation can have serious ramifications,
particularly when the misinformation is regarding life threatening conditions such as cancer. We currently lack
answers to even basic questions regarding cancer misinformation online. For example, how much cancer
misinformation is there on social media? How do people make assessments of trust and source credibility?
How well do people update their beliefs when cancer misinformation is corrected? What are the psychological
mechanisms of this belief updating? This Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) application by Dr.
Briony Swire-Thompson intends to fill this knowledge gap by building on her prior research regarding
misinformation prevalence on social media, source credibility, and the correction of misinformation. The
proposed research will be complemented by focused training on three areas, (1) increasing Dr. Swire-
Thompson’s knowledge of cancer and cancer misconceptions (2) furthering her social media data skills, and (3)
fostering professional development to facilitate the transition into an independent research position. These
training goals will be supervised by an interdisciplinary mentoring team. This team will be led by Dr. Lazer, a
University Distinguished Professor of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University’s Network Science
Institute. The co-mentors will be Dr. Viswanath, a cancer communications expert and Lee Kum Kee Professor
of Health Communication at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, and Dr. Johnson, an oncologist
and Assistant Professor at the University of Utah’s School of Medicine. This training will aid Dr. Swire-
Thompson to answer three specific research aims. First, the prevalence of cancer misinformation on social
media will be investigated. In the K99 phase, she will focus on Twitter to investigate who is more likely to be
exposed to and share cancer-related misinformation. In the R00 phase this will be extended to Facebook,
where we invite a representative sample of individuals to donate their social media data and respond to surveys
regarding their relationship with cancer, and why they share information. The second specific aim is to
investigate how people make judgements of source credibility, and the extent that credibility is reduced when
cancer sources are disreputable (such as spreading misinformation or having a lack of expertise). The third
specific aim is to understand the cognitive mechanisms behind updating belief in cancer misinformation. This
will be conducted by exploring whether cancer-related misinformation is more difficult to correct than non-
cancer related misinformation, and if so, why? This will be tested in both a general population and a population
whose close relatives have cancer. In sum, this 5-year research and training plan will allow Dr. Swire-
Thompson to establish an independent research program dedicated to understanding cancer misinformation
on social media and its correction."
10749903,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Obesity is a major global health concern. When people become obese, the body fails to respond well to insulin,
called insulin resistance. This process can lead to high blood sugar triggering type 2 diabetes, though the
underlying causes are poorly understood. We have shown that inflammation in the liver and fat are major
causes of insulin resistance. Fat tissue in mice and people have increased immune cells, T and B cells, that
cause inflammation. This net inflammation is one key link leading to obesity related insulin resistance.
The current research proposal investigates how the B cell behaves during early and later stages of obesity.
Interestingly, here we describe insulin itself as a major factor dictating the behavior of B cells in obesity.
Specifically, we show that insulin binding to its receptor on B cells causes the B cells to proliferate, make
inflammatory proteins and antibodies. This process contributes to establishment of insulin resistance since
when mice are genetically engineered to contain B cells lacking insulin receptors, the mice show improved
blood sugar levels when fed a diabetes inducing high fat diet for a limited time. However, this same pathway
may also limit immune cell function during longstanding obesity. Indeed, we see insulin resistance inside
immune cells with longer duration high fat diet, and compromised response to viral lung infection in mice with
insulin resistant immune systems. Thus, we believe that insulin is one critical factor which primes the immune
system to respond to danger signals in the environment and fuel its function. During establishment of obesity
and insulin resistance, insulin boost activation and metabolism of immune cells to heighten inflammation when
responding to danger signals; however, as the pathway becomes resistant, these immune cells with high basal
inflammatory tone are crippled to respond to new challenge such as virus. This mechanism also likely explains
in part why the obese cannot fight off viruses like influenza or SARS-2 coronaviruses.
In this proposal we will use genetically engineered mouse models to map out how insulin controls B cell
immunology during different durations of obesogenic diet. First, we will look at insulin’s capacity to control B
cell inflammation, metabolic programming and antibody production. Next, we will understand how diet induced
obesity communicates via insulin action on B cells to control blood sugar. This aim includes mapping out
insulin receptor docking sites on immunological target genes. Then we will characterize the immunological
consequences of immune cell insulin resistance during lung virus infection in a mouse model of influenza.
Finally, we will determine the relative mechanistic roles for obesity related danger pattern signaling in
contributing to the insulin resistant B cell inflammatory state. These experiments will give crucial new insights
into immune cell influence on obesity, and how obesity potentially cripples immunity, which has relevance to
many conditions, including lethal viruses such as our current pandemic."
10772150,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a common and often fatal chronic condition that can be effectively treated with
medications (MOUD). Agonists (methadone, buprenorphine) are first-line treatments that reduce overdose risk.
Black and Hispanic/Latinx patients are less likely to receive buprenorphine than non-Hispanic White patients.
This raises equity concerns, as buprenorphine may be safer, easier to access and less stigmatizing than
methadone for many patients. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in increased flexibility in
the provision of MOUD, including telemedicine initiations for buprenorphine. These policies may reduce
existing disparities by lowering care barriers but could exacerbate disparities if they are not equally beneficial
across groups. COVID-19-related policy changes present an unprecedented opportunity to examine impacts of
a structural intervention—relaxed MOUD restrictions—on disparities generated by structural racism and
discrimination (SRD). Guided by Public Health Critical Race praxis, which posits that racial/ethnic disparities in
healthcare access are produced by SRD, this project will use mixed methods to evaluate how disparities in
MOUD access may have changed in response to COVID-19-related policies in the Veterans Health
Administration (VA), the nation's largest provider of substance use care, and how SRD contributes. Unequal
access to buprenorphine is a significant problem nationally—studies estimate that Black patients with OUD are
50-60% less likely to access buprenorphine compared to White patients with similar disparities observed
among Hispanic/Latinx patients. The proposed research can guide national and health-system-specific policy
decisions regarding the continuation of relaxed MOUD prescribing guidelines post- COVID-19 and where to
target resources to address SRD and its sequelae. Lessons learned from this historical event can influence
future MOUD policy and practice, and it is essential that the impact on disparities and mechanisms underlying
disparities be understood to optimize policy changes with regard to equity. This study aims to: 1) examine how
changes in receipt of MOUD and retention following COVID-19 MOUD policies differ between Black and
Hispanic/Latinx compared to non-Hispanic White patients with OUD; 2) examine how community-level
sequelae of structural racism influence pre/post COVID-19 changes in MOUD receipt for Black and
Hispanic/Latinx patients with OUD; and 3) qualitatively examine experiences of OUD care and perceptions of
implementation of COVID-19-related policies among a sample of Black and Hispanic/Latinx patients with OUD.
Aims 1-2 are observational cohort studies using national VA electronic health record (EHR) data for Black,
Hispanic/Latinx, and non-Hispanic White patients with OUD. Aim 3 uses a qualitative study design involving
semi-structured phone interviews with Black and Hispanic/Latinx VA patients with OUD. A stratified random
sample will be balanced on gender and MOUD receipt pre/post COVID-19. Findings will be disseminated
through national channels to inform future MOUD policies and interventions to improve equity."

Hazardous alcohol use (HAU) leads to tremendous morbidity and mortality in millions of individuals in the United
States and worldwide annually. The cognitive, neuronal, and psycho-social aspects of alcohol use have been
well established. More recently, clinical, and basic research has begun to understand the role in which HAU
contributes to gut dysbiosis, which plays a significant role in one’s overall health status. Furthermore, a large
portion of deaths associated with alcohol use are related to digestive diseases. HAU predisposes and contributes
to the manifestation of several comorbidities, like hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus which
drive and exacerbate vascular dysfunction and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Previous research has
demonstrated that the gut microbiome too plays a critical role in the diagnosis and prognosis of individuals with
established CVD. Increased levels of circulating trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a gut derived metabolite, has
been shown to drive the development of atherosclerotic heart disease. However, the relationship between HAU-
induced gut dysbiosis and its’ metabolites towards vascular and CV function is not well-defined. We hypothesize
that HAU-induced gut dysbiosis leads to endothelial dysfunction and increased risk of CVD via gut-
derived metabolites (i.e., TMAO). Furthermore, we believe that HAU-induced gut dysbiosis exacerbates
the progression of heart failure and that gut microbiota-targeted therapies (MBTT) will restore vascular
function thereby improving CV health in the setting of HAU. Through utilization of mouse models of HAU
and microbiota adoptive transfer we plan to execute a series of studies that demonstrate HAU-induced dysbiosis
and CV-related pathology are related; moreover, that the dysbiotic microbiome is sufficient to cause the vascular
dysfunction and increased risk of CVD. We plan to utilize metagenomics, metabolomics, and cardiovascular
function assessment to demonstrate the causal relationship between HAU, the gut microbiome and CVD. We
will then investigate the effects of prior HAU gut dysbiosis on the progression of heart failure in a murine model
of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R). This will answer questions regarding the predisposition of individuals
who participate in HAU and their risk for worsening CV outcomes after MI/R-induced heart failure. Concurrently,
we will examine continuous HAU prior to and after MI/R-induced heart failure to understand if HAU leads to
increase morbidity or mortality in the presence of CVD. Successful completion of these studies will significantly
advance our understanding of the pathology of alcohol-induced gut dysbiosis and its’ effects on vascular and
cardiac function."

 While N-linked carbohydrate is known to comprise a significant portion of the mass of HIV-1 envelope
protein, the dogma has been that O-linked carbohydrate is absent from HIV-1 envelope protein. The
Desrosiers laboratory has now shown unambiguously that a subset of HIV-1 isolates have O-linked
carbohydrate on the V1 region of their gp120 surface glycoprotein. Furthermore, this O-linked carbohydrate is
able to shield virus from recognition by potent broadly-neutralizing antibodies of the V3-glycan class. Our
results suggest that long V1 regions, sometimes with sometimes without O-linked glycosylation, can emerge as
a mechanism to escape neutralizing antibodies similar to the V3-glycan monoclonal antibodies that have been
defined to date. Our proposed studies will better define the characteristics of V1 region sequences that are
predictive of whether an individual sequence is likely to be O-glycosylated. We will determine whether there is
specificity to the blocking effects, i.e. whether one O-glycosylated V1 region potently blocks recognition by one
V3-glycan mAb but not another while a different O-glycosylated V1 region may have different specificities to its
blocking effects. We will use experimental SHIV infection of rhesus monkeys to examine whether there is
selective disadvantage to such long O-glycosylated V1 regions in the absence of such antibodies and to
examine the types of selective pressure that may drive elongation and O-glycosylation of V1 regions."
10783794,"ABSTRACT
Pannexins comprise a unique family of heptameric large-pore channels that are emerging as novel targets
for treating common, yet hard to cure diseases such as hypertension and chronic pain. Previous studies
indicate that Panx1 is activated through stimulation of structurally unrelated receptors such as G protein-
coupled receptors, ligand-gated ion channels, and tumor necrosis factor receptors. However, it remains un-
clear what cellular mechanism(s) actually open and close the Panx1 channel downstream of such seemingly
unrelated stimuli. Furthermore, Panx2 and 3 are severely understudied and essentially nothing is known about
the activation mechanisms of these subtypes. The long-term goal is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying
pannexin gating, regulation, and physiological signaling pathways. The specific objectives for this proposal
are to identify the physiological pannexin activators and elucidate the subtype-specific activation mechanisms.
The central hypothesis is that both Panx1 and 2 are directly activated by naturally occurring signaling mole-
cules in living cells and that Panx1 specifically requires posttranslational modifications to be ""primed"" for its
activation. The rationale for the proposed research is that once the direct activation-stimuli and the subtype-
specific mechanisms are identified, it will enable us to fill the critical gap in the pannexin-dependent signaling
pathway by connecting the upstream cell-stimulation and the downstream ATP-permeable membrane pore
formation. To attain the overall objectives, the following three specific aims will be performed:1) Identify the
direct pannexin activators for living cells; 2) Elucidate the role of the N-terminal domain (NTD) in pannexin
activation; and 3) Uncover the subtype-specific structural features of pannexins. These research aims will be
executed by using a combination of a cell-based pannexin activity assay, electrophysiology, functional recon-
stitution, and cryo-EM. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it introduces a novel
concept that pannexins—including the understudied Panx2—are directly activated by signaling molecules
produced downstream of various stimuli in living cells. It is also innovative because it will provide important
insights into the structure of the open channel and why Panx2 and 3 behave differently from Panx1. The
proposed research is significant because it will provide concrete molecular mechanisms for the missing link
in the pannexin signaling function. The proposed research is also expected to provide a strong structural
foundation for subtype specific mechanisms of pannexin channels. These results are expected to have pro-
found positive impact not only because they provide detailed basic mechanisms, but also because they will
open a new door for screening/designing pannexin-specific inhibitors—much-needed molecular tools that
have great potentials to serve as novel therapeutics for a variety of currently uncurable diseases."

The application responds to NIGMS PAR-19-367 “Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (R35 - Clinical
Trial Optional)”
My research group focused initially on analytical methods for glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). These linear,
sulfated polysaccharides are attached to serine residues of proteoglycan molecules found on cellular surfaces,
in intracellular granules and in extracellular matrices. Binding interactions between GAGs and proteins are
central to aspects of animal physiology including cellular signaling, the cellular microenvironment, and host-
host, and host-pathogen recognition. My group developed methods for liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry analysis and sequencing of GAGs, extraction of GAGs from wet tissue and tissue slides, and
bioinformatics programs for interpretation of GAG MS and tandem MS data. We then pioneered methods to
acquire glycomics (GAGs and N-glycans) and proteomics from biospecimen tissue slides. We applied these
methods to study of neurological aging, cancer, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative diseases.
As funded through NIGMS R01GM133963 “Methods for determination of glycoprotein glycosylation similarities
among disease states”, my group is developing analytical and bioinformatics methods for glycoproteomics of
the extracellular matrix molecules (known as the matrisome) of brain. The primary focus has been on
glycoproteomics MS acquisition methods and bioinformatics for rigorous statistical determination of molecular
similarities for matrisome molecules and how these change during normal aging versus disease processes.
I now propose to expand our brain glycoproteomics molecular similarity scope to include characterization of
GAGs that modify specific matrisome molecules. Our goals will be to provide information on the
pathophysiological changes to matrisome molecules that escape detection using traditional antibody-based
detection methods. We will employ a new Omnitrap platform to characterize multiply glycosylated peptides and
peptides modified with GAG chains. We will also exploit the capabilities of ion mobility for measuring molecular
similarities from glycoproteomics data using a Waters Cyclic ion mobility-mass spectrometry instrument. We
will demonstrate these approaches by comparing matrisome molecular similarity among brain regions and as a
function of age."

Data consistently demonstrate alarming racial disparities among youth and adults impacted by the legal
system, and multiple studies have documented that justice-impacted youth have substantially higher rates of
psychiatric needs, substance use and HIV/STI risk behaviors than youth who have not had juvenile legal
system contact. However, research elucidating the impact of structural, cultural and individual racism on the
health and legal outcomes and disparities of justice-impacted ethnoracial minoritized youth and families is
nascent. This study will advance the science in structural racism and discrimination (SRD) and its influence on
public health and legal inequities by leveraging an existing statewide longitudinal dataset from Project EPICC
as well as following up with 300 previously enrolled youth and caregivers (N=300 dyads or 600 participants
total) to conduct once annual follow-up assessments and life course interviews. Informed by Ecodevelopmental
Theory, Project EPICC followed 401 youth and an involved caregiver (55% ethnoracial minoritized youth) for
two years starting from the time of first ever youth contact with the juvenile legal system. Data are available on
the longitudinal trajectories of substance use, psychiatric symptoms, HIV/STI risk behaviors and recidivism and
the multiple contributing risk and protective influences (individual, family and extrafamilial) on youth
trajectories. Project EPICC-2 will expand the Ecodevelopmental Framework to study the longitudinal impact of
structural racism and discrimination on trajectories of ethnoracial minoritized youth’s substance use,
psychiatric, sexual and reproductive health and legal outcomes during adolescence and into young adulthood.
Using statewide administrative data, we will expand original primary outcomes to include substance use and
psychiatric services utilization to understanding more about direct influence of structural racism and
discrimination on justice-impacted young adult healthcare services access and equity. Annual life course
interviews with a stratified random subsample of 50 young adults and 50 caregivers will provide a more
nuanced qualitative and contextual understanding of the impact of structural racism on adolescent, young adult
and family experiences and trajectories. EPICC-2 will leverage an existing longitudinal dataset, pre-existing
relationships with a large sample of justice-impacted families, an ecodevelopmental and intersectional (race,
ethnicity, sex, gender, socioeconomic status) framework, an intergenerational approach and an accomplished
multidisciplinary study team to answer critically important questions in the field of adolescent and young adult
health disparities."
10783767,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease induced by bacterial infection within the periodontium and affects
almost 50% of adults in the United States. Unresolved inflammation in this area results in the breakdown of the
periodontal ligament and alveolar bone which can lead to subsequent tooth loss. While the presence of bacteria
initiates periodontitis, it is ultimately not the sole factor that drives disease progression. The inflammatory
response is critical for the eradication of bacterial invaders, however the dysregulation of these mechanisms and
overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12 p40, and Macrophage Inflammatory
Protein 2 (MIP-2) have been implicated in the progression of tissue damage in the periodontium and in other
chronic inflammatory diseases. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a member of the class II HDACs located in
the cytoplasm that can deacetylate specific non-histone proteins and facilitate their translocation to the nucleus.
This deacetylation has been reported to alter production of inflammatory mediators in response to the stimulation
of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Our preliminary results have shown that stimulation of
innate immune cells with Porphyromonas gingivalis, a major pathogenic bacterium associated with chronic
periodontitis, resulted in phosphorylation of class II HDACs and subsequent deacetylation of FoxO1, which will
enhance its binding to the FoxO-binding element and thus promote associated pro-inflammatory mediator
production. Likewise, selective inhibition of HDAC6 resulted in a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine
production through increasing cytosolic translocation of FoxO1 and subsequently decreased its binding to the
promoter of C/EBP-β after P. gingivalis infection. Therefore, using P. gingivalis as a model organism, we
hypothesize that oral bacterial pathogens activate HDAC6 and enhance the inflammatory response
through facilitating the deacetylation and nuclear translocation of FoxO1, subsequently enhancing the
expression of downstream pro-inflammatory mediators. We will test this hypothesis using two aims.
Experiments proposed for Aim 1 will investigate the role of HDAC6 in the inflammatory response by observing
the production of inflammatory cytokines and the migration of neutrophils and will also delineate the downstream
signaling of HDAC6 in different immune cells in response to P. gingivalis challenge. In Aim 2, we will examine
the in vivo relevancy of HDAC6 signaling in gingival tissue inflammatory responses to oral bacterial infection and
alveolar bone loss. These aims will establish the regulatory function of HDAC6-mediated differential inflammatory
mediator secretion in the control of immune responses. The long-term goal of this proposed work will be to
identify novel interventional therapeutic targets and regulatory mechanisms of periodontal inflammation that may
be broadly applicable to other inflammatory diseases."

from early life stages. Our research aims to address circuit-wide mechanisms with cellular and molecular clarity
employing larval zebrafish. As a vertebrate genetic model organism, zebrafish shares considerable similarity
with mammals. In both mammals and larval zebrafish (See Preliminary data section), the lipid neurotransmitters
endocannabinoids (eCB) and the neuropeptide hypothalamic corticotropin releasing factor (Hy CRF) are known
to regulate motivated behaviors. However, an understanding of their roles circuit-wide at cellular resolution
is currently lacking. Larval zebrafish with a relatively simple and transparent brain of ~100K neurons (compared
to ~75 million in the mouse, and ~100 billion in the human brain) is well suited to address this question. New
regulatory principles uncovered in simpler systems will lay foundation for studying more complex systems.
Free-living with the need to hunt for food and avoid predators, larval zebrafish display readily observable
approach and avoidance behaviors in response to environmental stimuli, drugs, or social cues. Here I propose
to elucidate the role of eCB and Hy CRF, brain-wide at cellular resolution, in the context of light/dark preference,
a fundamental motivated behavior conserved across species. Larval zebrafish avoid dark, which can be
enhanced by stressors and alleviated by anxiolytics. Our preliminary data show that ablation of Hy CRF neurons
ameliorates, whereas inhibition of the cannabinoid receptor CB1 enhances, dark avoidance. We have genetically
disrupted major genes in the eCB signaling pathway, including CB1 (primarily neural) and CB2 (primarily
immune) receptors, receptor-interacting proteins (CNRIP1a and CNRIP1b), eCB synthesis enzymes (e.g.
DAGLa, DAGLb, ABHD4), and eCB degradation enzymes (MGLL, FAAH). These knockout animals are valuable
resources for understanding signaling specificity by uncovering which receptors and ligands and associated
regulatory proteins are involved in specific behavioral regulation. Furthermore, we have established brain-wide
calcium imaging and computational platforms for examining the activity and plasticity of distributed neural circuits
at cellular resolution.
In this application, built on these preliminary data and our expertise in studying brain development and function
employing zebrafish, we will test the hypothesis that eCB signaling regulates dark avoidance circuitry that
involves Hy CRF neurons. We will gain circuit-wide understanding and uncover new cell types/molecules for
future studies of circuit assembly and plasticity under stress or drug treatment in a highly accessible brain.
Impact and Outcomes: If successful, this project will achieve, for the first time to our knowledge, a cellular
resolution circuit-wide understanding of eCB signaling in relation to Hy CRF in a fundamental motivated behavior.
Such improved understanding at the whole circuitry level shall lay foundation for informing future marijuana policy

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with mutations in the microtubule
binding protein Tau. Average age of FTD onset is 49 years old with a life expectancy of 8.5 years. The clinical
presentation of FTD is heterogeneous with patients exhibiting parkinsonism, dementia, atrophy in the temporal
lobes, and personality changes. Current treatments can mitigate aspects of the behavioral changes associated
with FTD, however, no therapies are available to slow the progression. Since patient sample procurement is
restricted to post-mortem tissue, our understanding of the progression and underlying pathogenic mechanisms
of this disease is limited, and to address these issues requires the use of model organisms. Recent work in
model systems and post-mortem tissue has shown that expression of FTD-associated mutant Tau may lead to
epigenetic modifications that alter gene expression. In our lab, we model FTD using Drosophila, which allowed
us to conduct longitudinal studies to observe FTD progression throughout the adult lifespan. This revealed that
adult Drosophila expressing FTD-associated mutant human Tau (hTau) have age-dependent neurodegenerative
vacuoles, axonal changes, locomotion defects and impaired memory while flies expressing normal hTau did not.
This confirms that our models show pathogenic phenotypes associated with Tauopathies and it provides the
basis to now use these models to identify molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity. In this proposal, I hypothesize
that FTD mutant Tau alters heterochromatin distribution, which disrupts gene expression and chromatin structure
producing or contributing to the behavioral and neurodegenerative phenotypes seen in FTD pathology. In
addition, I hypothesize that the gene regulatory networks will vary depending on the FTD mutation as each
mutation is clinically distinct. I propose to test this hypothesis with the following aims: (1) Use single-cell omics
to assess how human Tau FTD mutations alter chromatin accessibility and gene expression in the young and
aged adult Drosophila brain, (2) Probe nuclear architecture changes by mapping heterochromatin regions in the
hTauK369I FTD Drosophila model, (3) Determine the role of novel candidate genes in our FTD Drosophila model
through genetic interaction tests. Utilizing single-cell technology will allow us to understand how the mutant Tau
affects distinct cell types in the brain and it may identify cell-type-specific candidates, and lead to the
development of targeted therapies."

The goals of this K23 application are to support shared decision-making for older adults considering kidney
transplant evaluation and to facilitate Dr. Catherine Butler's transition to independence as a physician scientist
whose research focuses on making the transplant evaluation process more person-centered and equitable.
Kidney transplant can be a valuable treatment option for the growing number of older adults with kidney failure,
but because of their limited life expectancy and high burden of comorbidity, most will not receive a kidney.
Further, the transplant evaluation itself can be time-consuming, burdensome, and risky, especially for older
adults who are particularly vulnerable to the complications of aggressive screening and treatments. Our
preliminary work suggests that patients often have little understanding of what to expect from the transplant
evaluation and limited opportunity to shape their involvement. A process of shared decision-making could help
older adults to navigate the complex trade-offs and uncertainties involved in the kidney transplant evaluation.
We propose an integrated research agenda intended to strengthen shared decision-making around referral for
kidney transplant among older adults. First, we will conduct an interview-based qualitative study to elicit the
experiences and perspectives of older adults with kidney failure related to the transplant evaluation process
along with their family members and clinicians (Aim 1). Second, we will describe the duration and likelihood of
completing discrete steps in the transplant process for a large national cohort of patients with kidney failure
(Aim 2). Finally, informed by these first two aims, we will adapt and pilot-test a communication tool to support
shared decision-making around referral for transplant among older adults with kidney failure (Aim 3).
During the award period, Dr. Butler will build upon her background in bioethics and early experience in
qualitative and epidemiologic research to acquire new expertise in the use of applied qualitative methods,
design and conduct of cohort studies, and development and testing of communication tools. This career
development plan will be supported by the exceptional research environment at the University of Washington,
including the Kidney Research Institute and the Seattle-Denver VA Center of Innovation. Dr. Butler's primary
mentor, Dr. Ann O'Hare, is an internationally recognized physician scientist whose research focuses on
complex care processes for older adults with kidney disease. Dr. Butler's co-mentors have complementary
expertise in transplant epidemiology (Dr. Peter Reese) and communication tool development and testing (Dr.
Margaret “Gretchen” Schwarze). The work proposed here will lay the foundation for a future trial to test the
communication tool developed during the award period and, more broadly, will identify multiple avenues to
improve upon the transplant evaluation process at both the individual- and systems-levels. Collectively, this
work will position Dr. Butler to become a successful independent physician scientist whose research focuses
on fostering a more person-centered and equitable approach to the kidney transplant evaluation process."

Orthopedic injuries represent one of the most significant health and economic burdens in our nation. Bone
fragility with age due to diseases such as osteoporosis increases the risk for fracture, while at the same time
leading to delayed bone healing resulting in a higher risk for non-union. With a growing aging population, the
demand for therapeutics to combat age-related bone loss is one of the pillars of the American Orthopedic
Association’s “Own-the-Bone” initiative. Current treatments mainly focus on preventing further bone loss rather
than increasing bone mass in a substantial manner. Skeletal stem and progenitor cells (SSPCs) are essential
for proper bone mass and bone healing. SSPCs are known to decline in frequency and function with age.
Therefore, SSPCs represent the most direct target to increase bone mass. Previous studies and our own data
suggest that Notch signaling plays a pivotal role in SSPC homeostasis and self-renewal. We recently identified
a conditional Notch knockout mouse model which exhibits a striking phenotype of increasing bone formation in
all skeletal elements in aging mice. This mouse model, the Ncstnf/f;LepR-cre mouse, is deficient in Nicastrin
(Ncstn), an essential component of the Notch signal transduction machinery of all 4 Notch receptors in LepR+
SSPCs. This model has exciting therapeutic potential to combat age-related bone loss. Based on this cKO model
and our preliminary data I hypothesize that Notch signaling is essential in maintenance of the skeletogenic stem
cell pool during adulthood and aging. In order to investigate the molecular mechanism by which Notch signal
inhibition leads to increased trabecular bone mass with age, we performed bulk RNA sequencing on LepR+
SSPCs from middle-aged WT and cKO mice. This unbiased sequencing approach identified Ebf3 as a
significantly downregulated gene in cKO cells and therefore potential downstream mediator of Notch signaling
in promoting SSPC differentiation into osteoblasts. Previous work has linked Ebf3 to the inhibition of
osteogenesis, however, the upstream regulators of Ebf3 are not yet known. Also, while others have looked into
the role of Notch in SSPCs, the downstream mechanisms by which Notch is controlling SSPC function are still
largely unknown. Therefore, this proposal aims to i) define the precise role of Notch signaling in SSPCs during
aging/adulthood on proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation and ii) uncover the molecular mechanism by
which Notch signaling is having the effects on proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation. These aims will
provide novel specific mechanistic insights into the mechanism by which a Notch-Ebf3 signaling axis maintains
skeletal stem cells in their primitive state throughout the lifespan of an animal."

adaptive strategies, including induction of the stringent response. The key stringent response enzyme RelMtb
is essential for long-term Mtb survival under physiologically relevant stresses in vitro and in animal lungs.
Recently, we have generated a therapeutic relMtb DNA vaccine, which induces RelMtb-specific cellular immunity,
and significantly augments the activity of the first-line drug isoniazid against active TB in mice. We also have
developed a novel vaccination strategy involving fusion of the antigen of interest with the immature dendritic

line anti-TB regimen and accelerates cure in the standard murine model of TB. Since HIV infection is
associated with disturbed T-cell homeostasis, including depletion of CD4+ T cells and persistent expansion of
CD8+ T cells, we will characterize the contribution of each of these cell types to the therapeutic efficacy of the
relMtb DNA vaccine in mice. In order to transition our findings to the clinical setting, we will next test the
immunogenicity of this vaccination strategy in rhesus macaques, which develop immune response patterns
most analogous to those of humans. Finally, leveraging archived clinical samples available through the
RePORT South Africa longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected and uninfected patients with pulmonary TB receiving
first-line anti-tubercular treatment, we will measure RelMtb-specific T-cell responses during TB therapy. This
proposal represents a unique collaboration between Investigators with significant expertise in microbiology,
molecular biology, immunology, DNA vaccines, and animal models. Our findings are expected to have far-
reaching implications for the development of novel adjunctive therapies for shortening the duration of
treatment for drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB, as well as novel diagnostic tools for confirming the
adequacy of TB treatment in HIV-infected and uninfected individuals."

Cellular senescence is not just a symptom of aging, but a contributor to aging pathologies. Recent
experiments in the mouse show that elimination of senescent cells (a.k.a. senolysis) can reverse several
features of the aging process and extend life- and health-span. This has stimulated interest in cell senescence
and in finding ways to suppress it that can be easily ported from mouse to human and made even more
effective. This implies looking for such drugs as an early senolytic candidate – a kinase inhibitor dasatinib,
whose mode of action is unclear. Taking senolytic therapies into human will also require a better
understanding of the cell type specific progression towards senescence and diverse sub-types of senescence.
In addition to aging per se cells respond to insults such as DNA damage, cell cycle arrest or oncogene
activation by expressing aging phenotypes, such as hypertrophy, cell cycle arrest markers, and by secreting
growth factors and chemokines, which are thought to produce degenerative responses in nearby cells.
Hypertrophy may be one of the most pervasive senescent cell responses but has been hard to study, as until
recently we have not had accurate enough means to measure cell mass and cell size, protein and lipid
content. Yet, hypertrophy is of special interest because it is deeply connected to cell growth, which is
normally under strict control in normal cells. We propose to study how cells, prompted by stressors like
radiation or drugs or simply by age, become hypertrophic and how they come to express senescence markers.
We have three goals: 1) to trace the progression of cell senescence in molecular terms by quantitative mass
spectrometry and phospho-mass spectrometry, and in physiological terms by Raman microscopy, 2) to
identify protein circuits responsible for cell senescence, and 3) to find drugs that will prevent, reverse, or
eliminate senescent cells. As our tools of perturbation, we have chosen kinase inhibitors. Employing a
machine learning approach, we will probe senescent cell development and senescent cell viability via a small
set of well-characterized poly-specific kinase inhibitors; then regress a phenotype, such as senescence-
specific signaling and senescent cell formation or death, to the activity of key kinases and their downstream
circuits. Kinases implicated that way will be independently validated using siRNA knock downs and CRISPR.
Additionally, extensive phospho-proteomic profiling will identify the phosphorylation sites on key proteins
that most contribute to the phenotypes of senescence and which could be druggable by other means. Taken
together, these methods will produce insight into the mode of action of already identified senolytic drugs
and suggest new targets and new drugs for seno-therapies. This combination of pharmacology, machine
learning, quantitative proteomics and new forms of microscopy can provide fresh insights into aging and
suggest potential therapies for aging-related disease."
10912781,"Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) affects ~100,000 individuals in the US and millions more worldwide. The disease
causes a range of adverse pathophysiological effects resulting in painful crises, organ failure, and eventually,
premature death. Our scientists spearheaded the development of a novel class of oral anti-sickling drugs based
on natural aromatic aldehydes, like vanillin from vanilla extract. This groundbreaking work demonstrated the
potential of aromatic aldehydes as allosteric effectors to stabilize the high O2-affinity state of hemoglobin S (HbS)
and reduce its tendency to polymerize, thereby inhibiting RBC sickling. This scientific foundation eventually led
to FDA approval of the first aromatic aldehyde drug Voxelotor. While the discovery of Voxelotor was monumental
for patients with this devastating condition, there are key limitations to its clinical efficacy, in particular the lack
of a definitive reduction in vaso-occlusions and other disease sequalae. There is still a major opportunity for next
generation oral drugs to push the limits of this therapeutic paradigm and transform SCD into a manageable
chronic condition. Over the past 15 years, our team has evaluated hundreds of aromatic aldehyde compounds
to identify best-in-class anti-sickling drug candidates. Novel insights from our structure-activity screening have
led to the discovery of aromatic aldehyde compounds with unique polymer-destabilizing properties. More
specifically, we discovered that certain aromatic aldehydes retain high anti-sickling potency even in total anoxia,
whereas Voxelotor completely loses efficacy in anoxia. Unlike Voxelotor, which relies solely on increasing
O2-affinity, our polymer-destabilizing compounds directly disrupt key polymer-forming contacts of HbS on the
αF-helix, thus inhibiting polymer formation. Induction of fetal Hb expression in RBCs is also known to destabilize
polymer formation by similarly disrupting key lateral contacts. A polymer destabilizing drug that can interrupt
polymer formation pancellularly across all RBCs may be the holy grail for the SCD treatment if it can overcome
key limitations to achieve unprecedented disease-modifying benefits with significantly less residual disease
sequalae. Based on highly encouraging preliminary data, we have plans to advance two bona fide lead drug
candidates to undergo pre-IND studies. VZHE-059 and IEX-021 are the most potent polymer destabilizing
compounds discovered to date, and have other favorable lead-like properties that would suggest these
candidates can become promising human drugs. VZHE-059 has already shown a clean toxicology profile. We
propose a robust panel of in vivo studies in the Townes homozygous HbSS mouse model to definitively
demonstrate the potential efficacy of VZHE-059 and IEX-021 for treating SCD to support advancing a lead drug
into a human trial. The proposed work includes formulation of each of the study drugs followed by trials of
voluntary oral administration to mice either in food chow or drinking water. Subsequently, definitive studies will
evaluate the efficacy of our lead compounds in terms of reversal of chronic hemolysis and recovery of anemia,
improvements in RBC half-life and deformability, and prevention of vaso-occlusion with hypoxia-reoxygenation."

Vision, in general, and stereopsis, in particular, depends on the selective decussation of retinal ganglion cell
axons and their termination in an orderly topographic manner. Axonal decussation is directed by the radial glia
and midline line neurons at the optic chiasm. The radial glia and midline neurons attach to the pial basement
membrane (PBM), a cell adherent, highly organized extracellular matrix sheet that forms the basal surface of the
brain including the chiasm. A key component of the PBM are laminins. In other brain regions laminins containing
the 2 subunit (2 laminins) provide environmental cues that control tissue and cellular organization including
polarity, proliferation, and differentiation. We hypothesize that 2 laminins in the PBM of the chiasm function to
polarize the radial glia and midline neurons. This polarization, in turn, regulates the spatial organization of
guidance cues thereby regulating axon decussation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that loss of 2
laminins from the PBM decreased axonal decussation resulting in an increased ipsilateral projection. We will
critically test this hypothesis in three aims. In Aim 1 we will determine the role of 2 laminins in the control of
axonal guidance cue expression during the early, peak, and late phases of axon growth. In Aim 2, we will
determine which laminin receptors are required for the polarity of radial glial cells and axon decussation using a
combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches. Our in vivo experiments will employ cell specific deletion of laminin
receptors, while our in vitro experiments will employ a technically innovative organotypic approach using function
blocking techniques. In Aim 3, we will determine how 2 laminins control the radial glia and midline neuron cell
polarity using sparse labeling of the cells and high-resolution microscopy. The experiments proposed here will
define the role of the β2 laminins during optic chiasm and tract formation. The findings from this work will pave
the way to exploit cell-matrix interactions for the development of rational strategies to promote the guided growth
and decussation of regenerating retinal ganglion cell axons."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting 5.5 million Americans. Despite
many decades of research there is still no known cure. AD is a protein misfolding disease, where the
Alzheimer's protein, Aβ, aggregates from a random coil entity into fibrils, which are highly organized
aggregates containing a cross-β sheet structure. However, the nature of the toxic species in Alzheimer's
disease remains unknown. More and more attention has been given to the possibility that Aβ aggregates
within mitochondria, rather than extracellular deposits of Aβ, may be responsible for the onset and
progression of the disease. Nature has developed mechanisms to prevent disease-associated protein
aggregation, e.g. by the introduction of heat shock proteins (Hsp's), which are overexpressed when cells
undergo stress. The most important Hsp's in mitochondria are Hsp60 and Hsp70, whereas Hsp60 is the
only essential chaperone in bacteria, yeast, and mammals. It is known that Hsp60 is cytoprotective against
many stressors in cells and is proposed to be directly protective against AD. However nothing is known
about the mechanism of how this is achieved.
Since almost nothing is known about the mitochondrial Hsp60 system, including its co-chaperone Hsp10, I
will use aims 1 and 2 of this proposal to explore this chaperone in absence of substrate protein. I seek to
solve the structure of different states of the chaperone during its protein folding cycle by cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM). Further, using novel solution-state NMR methods to study sparsely-populated
states, I will investigate how the co-chaperone is involved in the reaction cycle. This will provide important
information on the role of Hsp10 in substrate encapsulation. Further, during my independent phase I will
use the fundament knowledge obtained through aims 1 and 2 to move on to aim 3, where I will study the
interaction of Hsp60 with Aβ. I will not only elucidate the structure of long-lived major states of Aβ bound to
Hsp60 after substrate encapsulation by cryo-EM, but also study the transient interaction of Aβ with Hsp60
during the initial phase of the substrate folding cycle, prior to encapsulation, by solution-state NMR. These
studies will provide information about which Aβ species (monomer, oligomer, or fibril) interact with Hsp60
and elucidate their structural features. Aims 1 and 2 will provide insights into fundamental questions about
the mechanisms chaperones use to efficiently fold proteins into their functional forms. Further the results
from aim 3 will unveil details about how Hsp60 inhibits Aβ aggregation and prevents neurodegenerative
diseases, and may open up novel therapeutic strategies against Alzheimer's disease."

NusG is a transcription elongation protein used by virtually all organisms from the three domains of life. Bacterial
NusG associates with RNA polymerase (RNAP) through its N-terminal domain, whilst, despite its small size, the
C-terminal domain (CTD) forms dynamical interactions with other transcription factors (Rho, S10, NusB and
NusA) to affect transcription elongation. While all bacteria encode for a core NusG, many also synthesize
paralogs that transiently bind RNAP to alter expression of targeted genes. Yet, despite the importance of the
genes they regulate, most of the known subfamilies of NusG paralogs have not been investigated in depth (e.g.,
UpxY, TaA, and ActX). We recently discovered a new and widespread subfamily of NusG-like proteins, which
we called LoaP. Our preliminary investigation of this unique protein showed that Bacillus velezensis LoaP
activates expression of a regulon that is comprised of two different antibiotic synthesis operons. Upon further
inspection, we found evidence that suggests a broad regulatory relationship between LoaP and antibiotic
synthesis operons. This discovery is particularly important because our data suggests that the LoaP regulatory
protein reconfigures the transcription elongation machinery into an antitermination complex, capable of
bypassing multiple termination sites spread throughout the antibiotic synthesis operons. The presence of these
termination sites suggests that these operons have become ‘addicted’ to the LoaP antitermination factor, as their
transcription would be impossible without the dedicated antitermination complex. We speculate that this
observation explains why some antibiotic synthesis operons do not express well within the confines of a
heterologous host; they may have simply accrued termination sites that strikingly inhibit transcription elongation
in the absence of their cognate antitermination factor. Together, these data demonstrate how there is an urgent
need to better understand the genetic regulatory mechanisms affecting antibiotic synthesis operons, as this
information will influence the strategies used for discovering novel antibiotics and will lead to new tools for
improving heterologous production of antibiotics. Therefore, it is of significant importance to understand how the
LoaP antitermination mechanism exerts its regulatory influence over these important specialized metabolite
operons. Moreover, our preliminary data have demonstrated that LoaP uses a regulatory mechanism that is
different than those utilized by the other known NusG paralogs. In this project we will discover the molecular
mechanism used by LoaP to specifically manipulate transcription elongation of antibiotic synthesis operons. This
will significantly expand knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms that control antibiotic synthesis while also
revealing new and fundamental insight into the workings of the transcription elongation complex."

This research addresses an important public health concern, the development and maintenance
of adequate pitch variation and vocal clarity throughout the life span. Evidence has been
growing that vocal pitch range and stability of vocalization can be maintained with voice training
and therapy techniques that rely heavily on repeated pitch glides, presumably to stretch the
vocal ligament. It is impossible to measure directly the time-course of remodeling the vocal
ligament with exercise in live humans. However, strong inferences can be drawn from structural
and mechanical diversity across several species, from tissue engineering, and from
computational modeling. In this proposal, we combine (1) microscopic imaging to test collagen
density and fiber orientation in multiple species, (2) bioreactor design of a vocal ligament with
combined axial and vibrational stress and selected growth factors, (3) finite-element computer
modeling to predict fundamental frequency ranges and stability in vocal fold adduction, and (4)
human subject exercise protocols to increase fundamental frequency range and vocal adduction
control. While the aims can all be executed independently, they cross-validate each other on the
basic premise that the vocal ligament is critical for fo range and can change over time. A first
hypothesis is that the ligament can sustain high tension (up to 1 MPa) for high fundamental
frequencies. A second hypothesis is that the vocal ligament serves as a stabilizer in vocal fold
posturing and maintaining a consistently straight fold edge for glottal closure. Doses of repeated
stretching are designed for engineering tissue in vitro and for human subject exercises. Results
will benefit a large population of people who are vocally active but whose voices appear
physiologically weak or aged."

Filoviruses cause severe hemorrhagic fevers and are among the deadliest human viruses with no approved
treatment or prophylactic options. Periodic outbreaks, such as the recent epidemic of Ebola virus (EBOV) in
West Africa, exhibit mortality rates ranging from 50-90%. They are classified as “Category A priority bioweapon
agents” by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most advanced candidates for anti-filovirus
therapy with proven efficacy in non-human primates (NHPs) utilize RNA interference (RNAi), high dose mixtures
of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), or repurposed influenza, herpes or hepatitis C inhibitors. Although they
represent important advances, these approaches have serious limitations including the high therapeutic doses
required (20-30 g of mAb/patient), limited spectrum (primarily Zaire ebolavirus) and/or narrow therapeutic
windows (small molecules/RNAi).
Building on recent work demonstrating the critical nature of endosomal interactions between the filoviral
glycoprotein (GP) and the host cholesterol transport protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) for filoviral entry, we have
developed antibodies and small molecules that disrupt this mechanism to inhibit viral entry. These include
several bispecific GP-targeting pan-ebolavirus broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) efficacious in multiple
animal models, with down-selection to a final cocktail based on NHP efficacy underway. In parallel, we identified
a phenylpiperazine compound MBX-5321, which inhibits the GP-NPC1 interaction to block infections of virulent
EBOV, SUDV and MARV at nM concentrations in vitro, demonstrates excellent PK/PD properties, exhibits
excellent murine tolerability, has established efficacy in mice, and is currently being optimized for a targeted IND.
In this proposal we will tether MBX-5321 to bispecific pan-filo bNABs to make broad-spectrum antibody-drug
conjugates (ADCs) that synergistically inhibit viral entry.
The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate that these ADCs will provide improved efficacy and selectivity
for filovirus treatment over either agent alone, providing highly efficacious pan-filo agents, broadening the
therapeutic window and easing drug stockpiling efforts. We will accomplish this objective through three specific
aims: In Aim 1 we will synthesize and complete physical characterization of >40 ADCs demonstrating serum
stability with efficient endosomal release. In Aim 2 we will prioritize ADCs through in vitro analysis of pan-filovirus
inhibitory activity. In Aim 3 we prioritize ADCs for PK and toxicity and evaluate two pan-filovirus ADCs for in vivo
efficacy in a mouse model of EBOV infection."
10765723,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism of cell-cell communication that bacteria use to orchestrate
collective behaviors, including virulence and biofilm formation. QS relies on the production, release, and group-
wide detection of extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers (AI). QS allows bacteria to synchronously
alter gene expression patterns that underpin collective behaviors, for example, biofilm formation. Some receptors
bind and respond exclusively to one AI, while others bind and respond to multiple AIs. QS is responsible for
releasing public goods that are beneficial to kin and, potentially, non-kin, and as a result, it plays an important
role in shaping microbial community architecture. QS is now understood to be the norm in the bacterial world.
Nonetheless, how different bacterial QS receptors initiate signal transduction is not understood. Defining the
mechanisms that regulate QS-mediated production of public goods will be key for generally understanding how
organisms coordinate community level changes in gene expression. This is particularly important in light of our
findings that P. aeruginosa QS can be activated by signals produced by non-kin. Thus, determining the
mechanisms that regulate QS progression after signal recognition will allow us to understand the respective
benefits and drawbacks of strict versus relaxed ligand detection in QS-mediated communication. Bacteria live in
heterogeneous communities and encounter mixtures of AIs produced by themselves, their kin, and their non-kin
neighbors. Upon signal recognition, LasR and RhlR activate hundreds of genes, many of which are involved in
pathogenesis and biofilm formation. While some signal transduction pathways follow a linear circuit, the QS
system in P. aeruginosa is best described as a dense network of receptors and regulators with interconnecting
regulatory systems and outputs. Canonically, the LasR-AI complex activates expression of rhlR and rhlI, thus
launching the second QS system, enabling the two QS systems to function in tandem. Surprisingly, rhlR can be
upregulated in clinical isolates containing lasR inactivating mutations. RhlR can also function without its partner
synthase to regulate certain genes. This is achieved via a metallo-hydrolase known as PqsE. We discovered
that PqsE and RhlR interact to form a complex. We will explore the role of PqsE in regulating RhlR function and
describe their tandem role in transcriptional regulation and pathogenesis in AIM 1. The progression into QS
corresponds to a downregulation of certain regulatory elements that function at low cell density to potentially
mitigate early entry into QS. We have discovered that Fis, which is expressed during log phase, regulates the
production of rhlA, a gene responsible for the synthesis of rhamnolipids, which are a bacterial surfactant
important for infections. We will explore the mechanism Fis uses to achieve this regulation, in addition to what
role it might play in regulating other QS genes and behaviors in AIM 2."

10767168,"Project Summary and Abstract
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disease which arises from a nonsense mutation of the
dystrophin gene, dmd. Dystrophin has important functions in protecting muscle from mechanical damage and
mutations in the gene results in muscle degeneration. The natural progression of the disease involves muscle
degeneration in the limbs leading to loss of mobility and eventual degeneration of cardiac and diaphragm muscle,
leading to death. Duchenne muscular dystrophy affects 1 in 5,000 male births, renders most patients paralyzed
by age 12, and on average results in death by age 26. There is no known cure and current treatments only delay
disease progression or are aimed at quality-of-life improvements.
Gene therapy is an emerging technology that aims to cure genetic diseases. Currently, two main approaches
are being explored. Although CRISPR/Cas9 developments have advanced genetic engineering significantly in
recent years, many barriers still remain to clinical treatment of diseases such as DMD, including off-target editing,
insertion/deletion mutations, delivery of the large protein complex, and immunogenicity of expressing the
bacterial enzyme. Gene-replacement therapy is a promising alternate and potentially curative strategy. Gene-
replacement therapy delivered by Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) offers an elegant solution by replacing, rather
than editing, the defective gene. Using AAVs, exogenous DNA is delivered to target cells and stably resides
extra-chromosomally. The dystrophin gene can then be subsequently expressed, functionally replacing the
defective endogenous copy. Due to cargo-capacity limitations of AAVs however, current clinical testing have
been restricted to highly truncated versions of dystrophin with resulting limited efficacy.
Recently developed technology overcomes the cargo capacity limitation of AAVs, providing an avenue for
delivery of full-length gene replacements. First, split-gene constructs are designed by dividing the full gene into
fragments, flanked by regions containing both intronic and base-pairing binding sequences, where each fragment
is delivered by a sub-population of an AAV cocktail. Within the cell, the expressed RNA fragments are locally
stabilized by the base-pairing of the binding domains, then undergo a spliceosome-mediated joining reaction,
thus concatenating the fragments into full-length mRNA for translation and restoration of functional protein.
Preliminary data demonstrates the ability of this approach to deliver three-fragment fluorescent reporters in
mouse muscle. The proposed research aims to develop this technology as a gene-replacement therapy through
the engineering of robust constructs for dystrophin gene delivery, optimization of on- and off-target delivery both
in vitro and in vivo, and characterization of both therapeutic and unintended host responses in a Duchenne
Muscular Dystrophy mouse model. This project will demonstrate the therapeutic potential of a novel class of
gene-replacement therapies. Further, this project lays the groundwork for future studies in higher mammals, and
for a potential future treatment and cure of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy in patients."

Major depressive disorder (depression) affects over 16 million adults in the U.S. per year and is the second
leading cause of disability. Current medications were discovered largely by serendipity and act non-specifically,
leading to unwanted side effects in addition to suboptimal effectiveness. We believe that a better understanding
of the underlying pathologies, such as deficits in reward processing due to stress, will lead to more specific,
effective treatments. The objective of this grant is to determine how stress affects activity in the lateral habenula
– a brain region that encodes reward, is sensitive to stress, and is implicated in depression – and how altered
lateral habenula activity leads to diminished reward responsivity in mice. Although studies have found that stress
induces plasticity in the lateral habenula, how stress affects in vivo activity and reward encoding in the lateral
habenula is poorly understood. The dominant model in the field is that stress causes tonic hyperactivity in the
lateral habenula, which contributes to depression. However, we recently discovered that acute stress severely
alters phasic reward signaling in the lateral habenula, changing decreases in activity (normal reward response)
into increases in activity (punishment-like response). Our hypothesis is that stress not only increases tonic activity
in the lateral habenula, but also alters phasic signaling of reward, which decreases reward responsivity. We will
test this hypothesis in mice using chronic, deep-brain imaging and electrophysiological recording of lateral
habenula activity during reward consumption, before and after stress. Our hypothesis predicts that both acute
and chronic stress alter phasic signaling of reward in the lateral habenula as animals become less responsive to
reward behaviorally. We will test for causal effects of phasic lateral habenula reward signals on reward
responsivity in mice by perturbing lateral habenula activity during reward consumption. Our hypothesis predicts
that phasic inhibition of lateral habenula activity during reward consumption will reverse the deleterious effects
of stress on reward responsivity. Conversely, we predict that increasing phasic lateral habenula activity during
reward consumption will mimic the effects of stress on reward responsivity. We will also determine if stress
increases tonic activity in the lateral habenula and whether changes in tonic activity contribute to aspects of
reduced reward responsivity. This study is significant because it specifies a mechanism by which stress affects
reward processing and localizes it to a region of the brain that is implicated in depression. Validation of our
hypothesis will focus future efforts on characterization of the molecular mechanisms of these activity and reward
signaling transformations, their role in altered decision-making, and identification of the inputs/outputs of the
lateral habenula that are involved, potentially leading to new therapies that improve reward responsivity in
depression."

HIV and intimate partner violence (IPV) are intersecting, mutually-reinforcing epidemics that significantly affect
African American women, particularly women in the U.S. South. African American women face some of the
highest rates of both HIV and IPV among U.S. women, and these burdens are most pronounced in the South.
IPV-exposed African American women may experience forced, condomless sex, which increases the risk of
HIV acquisition. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the most innovative HIV prevention strategy, however it
remains underutilized by African American women and residents of the South. In order to reduce African
American women’s HIV acquisition risk in the South, effective HIV prevention interventions need to
concurrently address relationship safety and HIV acquisition risks. The proposed training plan in this Mentored
Research Scientist Development Award (K01) application will provide the knowledge and skills that the
principal investigator, Tiara C. Willie, PhD, MA needs to launch an independent and productive research
career. Further, the proposed research would contribute significantly to PrEP implementation in real-world
settings and facilitate PrEP access to African American women in the South. The proposed research aims to
address this call via the development, testing, and evaluation of a PrEP Implementation Toolkit for staff in
community healthcare clinics in the South. The Toolkit will be evaluated using the Reach, Effectiveness-
Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM). The Toolkit will facilitate PrEP uptake among eligible
African American women in the South, especially IPV-exposed women. This K01 project includes formative
work (i.e., reach stage), like key informant interviews with staff at partnering clinics (N=10), and six focus
groups with African American women. The qualitative data will inform the development of the PrEP
Implementation Toolkit. The Toolkit will be employed in two clinics using a nonrandomized waitlist control
design. Monthly aggregated clinic data will be collected 8-months before and after Toolkit implementation in
each clinic. Toolkit effectiveness will be assessed using interrupted time series analyses and outcomes are
changes in PrEP uptake, coverage and retention among African American women. Four focus groups with staff
will be conducted to assess adoption, acceptability, and feasibility. 20 qualitative interviews with staff will be
conducted to assess fidelity. This project will yield preliminary evidence of a PrEP implementation program for
African American women with a focus on IPV. It will also inform future large-scale studies using stepped-
wedge designs. The training acquired by Dr. Willie via this timely and novel project, courses, workshops,
conferences, manuscript and grant-writing, and mentorship will target 3 training objectives to gain expertise in:
(1) HIV prevention research among African American women, (2) intervention development and evaluation,
and (3) implementation science in clinics."

esophageal cancer) are less likely to undergo surgery, and suggests that those who undergo surgery may be less likely to

racial/ethnic disparities is warranted especially in Alabama (AL) and Mississippi (MS). These two states of the US Deep
South have high GI cancer incidence and mortality, and high mortality for AAs in particular, large AA populations, and
challenges for access to quality care such as limited affordability and availability. Neither surgical care disparities nor
their driving mechanisms have been examined in these states. In addition, lay navigation and Enhanced Recovery After

implementation of ERAS processes has led to the elimination of surgical disparities in length of stay without
compromising surgical outcomes. Our long term objective is to ultimately eliminate disparities in GI cancer surgery care

affordable, available, accessible and accommodating; 3) Assess the feasibility of a combined surgery-focused lay
navigation and ERAS intervention in GI cancer. Results from Aims 1 an 2 will guide the development of a surgery-focused
navigator program to facilitate access to timely surgery and support patients in the peri- to post- surgery phases. By
accomplishing Aims 1-3, we will define: i) future intervention targets for GI cancer patients in AL and MS, i.e.,
populations and surgery processes; ii) mechanisms to address in order to achieve effective surgical care; and iii) a
surgery focused navigation program to optimize the uptake of surgery and implementation of ERAS for AAs. Thus, the
expected outcome of this project is a concrete and detailed actionable plan to eliminate surgical disparities in AL and
MS. Without this significant new knowledge, progress toward the elimination of disparities in GI cancer surgery is
hindered. With this plan, we will be well prepared to achieve our objective and have a high impact on the goals of the
National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to advance
scientific knowledge that will help all people live longer, healthier lives, and eliminate health disparities."
10767177,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Because hospitals transfer emergency department patients when they lack capability, in order to ensure that
access to emergency care is equitable, it is critical that these transfers do not vary by race, ethnicity, or payer.
This goal is enshrined in the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which requires Medicare-
participating hospitals to provide emergency care to all patients, regardless of race, ethnicity, or insurance status.
Yet disparities in emergency department transfers exist. The hypothesis of the proposed study is that these
disparities reflect structural racism and discrimination; hospitals may circumvent the goals of EMTALA by
leveraging the “nondiscrimination provision” of that law, which requires that hospitals with specialized capabilities
accept EMTALA transfers if they have capacity. The project will examine strategic use of the nondiscrimination
provision in the following three aims: (1) measure differences in ED length of stay for minority versus White non-
Hispanic transfer patients, and determine whether differences in length of stay are associated with disparities in
patient outcomes; (2) assess whether minority, versus White non-Hispanic, ED patients requiring specialized
care are less likely to be transferred to hospitals within the same ownership system; and (3) determine whether
minority ED patients, compared with White non-Hispanic patients, are more likely to be transferred to a safety-
net hospital. All analyses will examine differences by race/ethnicity and by race/ethnicity for patients with the
same payer. The proposed research is innovative because it identifies structural racism and discrimination
through variations in organizational behavior, and permits us to disentangle differences by race/ethnicity versus
payer. Furthermore, it allows us to examine not just whether minorities are less likely to experience an ED
transfer than White non-Hispanic patients, but also whether there are differences in the timing of the ED transfer
and whether minority patients are more likely to be transferred to different hospitals than White non-Hispanic
patients. The proposed project is significant because these insights may be used to improve policy by providing
evidence whether improving the equity of ED transfers might be best addressed by promulgating regulations to
promote non-disparate emergency department transfers, or expanding protocolization of these transfers."
10767178,"Delayed arrival to the hospital in stroke is a major unsolved problem in public health that leads to stark and
persistent racial and socioeconomic disparities in stroke outcomes. The delay generates health disparities
because racial minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients arrive later than White patients leading
to less access to treatment and worse outcomes. The most common reason for delay is the time spent by the
patient and witnesses who decide together to watch-and-wait or go to the hospital. Therefore, we propose that
social connectedness is a major determinant of the delay phenomenon. Our team has demonstrated that social
network structure around a specific patient determines the flow of information that leads to decisions to act
rapidly or slowly. Patients who arrived early had large and loosely connected networks, while those who
arrived late had small and close-knit networks. What remains lacking, however, is knowledge of the extent of
the social network effect in a more diverse population of stroke patients, its mechanism, and translation into
interventions to improve stroke delay and disparities. This understanding is critical to establishing rigor and
premise for future social network interventions aimed at reducing disparities in stroke outcomes. Our long-term
goal is to design network-based interventions that reduce delay during stroke and ensure equitable access to
therapies. Therefore, in this project, we use a dual empirical and social simulation approach to characterize
and model social network effects in a diverse patient population. In Aim 1, we will determine whether social
networks affect delay in hospital arrival after stroke differentially by race and socioeconomic status. We will
capture social network data and time to arrival in 500 racially and socioeconomically diverse patients during
their hospital admission. In Aim 2, we will model the potential of network interventions to improve stroke delay
in at-risk populations. Using data from the same 500 patients and persons in their network, we will
parameterize an agent-based model to represent the dynamic decision-making within the social network during
stroke. Then we will evaluate the potential effects of network interventions to improve delay and disparities
within the model. Our central hypothesis is that social network metrics will be associated with hospital arrival
time, social networks will moderate race and SES differences in arrival time, and that network interventions
such as increasing network size will improve outcomes and disparities in social simulations. We have
assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in stroke, social networks, agent-based modeling, and health
disparities to execute this project. The proposed research will provide much needed empirical data on social
network effects and the potential of network interventions to address stroke delay and its disparities. These
results will have a positive impact by directly setting the stage for testing social network interventions in acute
stroke clinical trials to improve arrival time and enhance equitable access to stroke therapies."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects roughly 10% of people over the age of 65 in the United States
and extracts an enormous personal and financial toll on the nation. Despite decades of
investment there exists no cure nor effective treatment. Contributing factors behind the
difficulty include the complex, multifactorial nature of AD etiology that is refractory to direct
clinical observation especially in its early stages.
As such, research models are of paramount importance as they hold great potential to reveal key
mechanistic details driving the progression of AD in the clinic. This is of particular relevance
today as there is a growing consensus that the A-Beta hypothesis must give way to approaches
that reflect the complex, multifactorial nature of AD. Fortunately, new methods such as spatial
biology are well suited to capture the complexity of protein networks implicated in AD in ways
that traditional histological analysis cannot. Unfortunately, however, barriers to apply spatial
biology in whole tissues and organs are substantial, including high cost of instrumentation,
technically complex workflows, and substantial data management, analysis, and visualization
challenges.
This proposal will help eliminate these barriers by offering a convenient fee-for-service platform
where brains can be sent to be imaged and analyzed. High value region-of-interest tissue
sections can be quickly identified and selected for secondary spatial biology analyses. The
analyzed tissue sections and 3D datasets can then be mapped back to their correct location in in
vivo imaging and brain atlases such as the Allen CCF. Importantly, this project will be built on a
high-performance cloud platform that can handle multi-terabyte multiplexed datasets and serve
them efficiently such that researchers can easily compare treatment effects on a per brain region
basis across age, sex, and mouse model.
This proposal extends the success of a previous NIA proposal that combined teams from
TissueVision and the NIA-funded MODEL-AD Center at The Jackson Laboratory. To build on
this impressive partnership we will be adding Bruker, Inc. a $2.4B manufacturer of scientific
instruments that is currently advancing cutting-edge spatial biology approaches, notably
MALDI-IHC, which will be capable of performing a 60+ plex imaging of tissue datasets. In
addition, the Seattle Veteran’s Administration will be assisting our spatial profiling efforts with
Imaging Mass Cytometry on its Fluidigm Hyperion system. We believe the synergy between
next-generation AD research models, advanced spatial biology instrumentation and data
analysis represents an ideal alliance that holds the promise to deliver an extremely valuable set
of new tools to the AD research community that may finally open the way for effective AD
treatments."
10766348,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Our long-term goal is to understand the cellular and genetic rules governing how endothelial cells (EC),
vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and sympathetic neurons (SN) interact within the artery. SNs innervate
vascular SMCs and control normal vascular functions such as circulation, respiration, body temperature, and
metabolism. Thus, aberrant regulation of the vascular-mural-sympathetic (EC-VSMC-SN) interaction underlies
numerous cardiovascular pathologies which affect millions of people worldwide. Although much progress has
been made in identifying the molecular signaling controlling the individual EC, VSMC, and SN vascular functions,
less is known about the players that allow the three cell types to work as a unit. This lack of knowledge is
underscored by the limited strategies available to improve vascular function by manipulating the sympathetic
vascular unit.
 Here we will use a basic science approach to address this problem through experiments designed to
unravel the cellular and genetic mechanisms that govern normal EC-VSMC-SN unit formation. We will first
understand, via live-cell imaging microscopy, how blood flow coordinate EC-VSMC-SN unit assembly at the
dorsal aorta in zebrafish (Aim 1) and then dissect the function of the identified flow-depended genetic programs
in each cells to allow the neurovascular coupling (Aim 2). Finally, in Aim 3, thanks to our successful collaboration
with Drs. Anne Eichmann, Martin Schwartz and Martina Brueckner, the signaling and cellular study of the EC-
VSMC-SN unit will be translated in the mammalian cardiovascular system.
 Given the therapeutic potential of manipulating sympathetic innervation, our studies will have a broad,
positive impact on identifying novel targetable signaling pathways to control sympathetic function."
10766463,"ABSTRACT
 Tobacco use remains a major public health and economic concern, particularly in women who are more
susceptible to the long-term consequences of nicotine exposure. Clinical evidence has revealed that stress
produced by nicotine withdrawal can be intensified by fluctuations in gonadal hormones in women, although the
underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Thus, there is a critical need to determine the mechanisms by which
stress systems enhance withdrawal severity in females versus males, and the influence of ovarian hormones on
these measures in adult females. If this knowledge gap is not filled, then the challenges of reducing nicotine use
and developing specialized medications for females will remain largely insurmountable. The long-term goal of
our research program is to identify the mechanisms that mediate nicotine use among different clinical populations
that are uniquely susceptible to this problem. The objective of this application is to determine the mechanisms
that promote withdrawal from chronic nicotine vapor inhalation. Recent work in male rodents has revealed that
nicotine withdrawal is modulated in the medial habenula-interpeduncular nucleus (MHb-IPN) pathway. Our
central hypothesis is that sex differences in withdrawal are modulated in the local circuits of the IPN, where
stress and ovarian hormones modulate withdrawal severity in females. Specifically, our mechanistic
hypothesis is that females experience greater inhibitory tone in the IPN via local interneurons that release the
inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). These GABA interneurons express type 1
receptors for the stress peptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRFR1). We posit that chronic nicotine produces
a greater enhancement of CRF production and CRFR1 receptor expression which further promotes GABAergic
inhibitory tone in the IPN of females. The rationale for the proposed research is that its successful completion is
likely to contribute to a mechanistic framework for the development of new cessation strategies, particularly for
women. Guided by strong preliminary data, the following specific aims were designed to: 1) identify the
mechanisms by which the IPN controls nicotine withdrawal in females and males and 2) determine the effects of
ovarian hormones on IPN-modulated nicotine withdrawal in females. The proposed studies constitute a multi-
disciplinary approach involving tract tracing, behavior, immunocytochemistry, neurochemistry, and gene-transfer
technology to compare sex differences (Aim 1) and the influence of ovarian hormones (Aim 2) on withdrawal
severity and inhibitory tone in the IPN. The proposed work is innovative because it combines state-of-the-art
methods to unveil the mechanisms by which inhibitory tone in the IPN modulates withdrawal in a sex- and
hormone-dependent manner. The proposed research is significant because the results are expected to inform
the development of future interventions that will selectively target the underlying mechanisms of withdrawal.
Ultimately, the results of our research continuum are expected to contribute meaningfully to the design of
precision therapeutics that will reduce health disparities produced by chronic nicotine use, particularly in women."
10767883,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic pain and early cognitive decline are increasingly prevalent among older adults, bidirectionally related, and
individual risk factors for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Chronic pain and cognitive
decline exacerbate each other, placing individuals on a “disability spiral” or worsened physical, emotional, and
cognitive functioning with incremental risk of ADRD. Currently there are no evidence-based treatments that successfully
address the chronic pain-early cognitive decline comorbidity among older adults. With funding from NCCIH and
NIA we used mixed methods to iteratively develop a multimodal, theory grounded, group-based mind-body activity
program tailored to the unique needs of older adults with chronic pain and early cognitive decline. The program helps
older adults manage pain, increase cognitive reserves, and increase engagement in activities that are meaningful to them
using quota-based pacing reinforced by a digital monitoring device. The program shows excellent feasibility and
acceptability for virtual delivery and remote data collection. Program participation is associated with improvement in
multimodal physical function (self-report, 6-minute walk test and Actigraph measured stepcount), emotional function
(depression and anxiety), cognitive function (self-report and objective), pain intensity and theory informed mediators.
Building on our promising study we now propose to conduct a fully powered RCT of our mind-body activity program
(Active Brains-Digital) versus an educational control (Health Enhancement Program) both delivered virtually among
N=260 older adults with musculoskeletal chronic pain and early cognitive decline. We will establish efficacy of Active
Brains-Digital, sustainability of improvement over 6 months, and mechanisms of change through relevant mediators and
moderators. The trial will take place at the Massachusetts General Hospital using our established methodology and
infrastructure. Active Brains-Digital has the potential to be the first evidence-based program for older adults with
chronic pain and early cognitive decline, with important implications for prevention of AD/ADRD in this high risk
population. This project directly aligns with NIA strategic Goal C, objectives 1 and 3."

 Cytokinesis is the physical division of one cell into two. This final step of the mitotic or meiotic cell cycle
partitions the duplicated and segregated genome into topologically distinct daughter cells, and thus ensures
genome stability. Cytokinesis is essential for development of the fertilized egg into a multicellular organism, for
the replenishment of tissues to compensate for wear and tear, and to avoid diseases of proliferation including
cancer and some neutropenias (blood cell disorders). For over a century, people have marveled through the
microscope at dividing animal cells, but major questions about the mechanisms of cytokinesis remain. Many of
these questions fall under the three Themes of our research program: 1) the cytoskeletal rearrangements that
drive contractility, 2) the role of feedback loops in cytokinetic regulation, and 3) modeling the mesoscale.
 In animal cytokinesis, the cell changes shape as a furrow forms at the cell equator, the region between
the two masses of segregated chromatin, as defined by spatio-temporal cues from the anaphase spindle. These
cues lead to local activation of RhoA at the plasma membrane. RhoA elicits non-muscle myosin II (NMMII)
filament assembly and activity, the generation of long actin filaments (F-actin) by formins, and the cortical
recruitment of crosslinkers including anillin and septins. In sum, a circumferential band of cortical actomyosin
cytoskeleton assembles and contracts via rearrangement of these cytoskeletal components. F-actin is slid,
bundled, crosslinked and coupled to the plasma membrane, polarity sorted, bent, broken and depolymerized.
The biophysics of many nano-scale binding partnerships are well studied, but often with sparse collections and
without confinement. Since the relative contributions of the many activities listed above to in vivo network
dynamics are unknown, our first theme is to define the cytoskeletal remodeling that underlies contractility.
 After spindle cues pattern the cell equator, both biochemical and mechanical positive feedback boosts
these signals. Concurrently, global and localized inhibition via negative feedback limits RhoA activity. Our
unpublished observations of contractile oscillations suggest that multiple negative feedback loops coexist. The
second theme of our work is the role of feedback loops in cytokinetic regulation.
 To develop a conceptual model of cytoskeletal rearrangements in cell division, one may imagine the
nanoscale molecules and fibers and their millisecond behaviors literally woven into a dynamic material. Like
biophysics and cell biology, respectively, mathematical modeling also describes cytoskeletal rearrangements at
these two ends of the time- and length scales, via distinct approaches: particle-based modeling (nano- or micro-
scale), or continuum mechanics theory (macro-scale). Since both families of approaches have limited ability to
coarse grain the mesoscale spatial and temporal heterogeneities of the cytokinetic ring components’ activity
states, behaviors, abundances, and combinations, we are working to understand cytokinetic cytoskeletal
rearrangements and integrated regulation, by innovating methods to model the mesoscale (theme three)."

10768686,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable brain disorder, with a staggering human and financial cost in a rising

development of effective pharmacological interventions. We have recently shown that noninvasive Gamma

positive effects on microglia, astrocytes, cerebral vasculature, as well as reduced accumulation of amyloid and
hyperphosphorylated tau in respective amyloid and tauopathy mouse models. However, the mechanisms by
which GENUS impacts cell-cell interactions, in particular, interactions between neurons and microglia, are not

The Proteomics Resource Laboratory Shared Resource (PRL) was established 10 years ago under the
direction of Beatrix Ueberheide, PhD, Associate Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology and
Neurology. She has over 20 years of experience in mass spectrometry (MS) with over 100 publications and is a
well-recognized expert in biological MS. The PRL mission is to aid scientific discovery by Perlmutter Cancer
Center (PCC) members by providing access to specialized expertise and state-of-the-art instrumentation and
techniques for MS analysis of proteins. PRL provides advice and full-service MS-based proteomics analysis in
a highly collaborative manner to foster cutting-edge research by PCC members. PRL services are critical to the
four PCC Research Programs as proteomic analysis is central to much of basic, translational, and clinical cancer
research. During the previous funding period, 57 PCC members used PRL, 25 PCC publications included PRL
data, and 24 of these had PRL co-authors. PRL consults on experimental design and provides full support of
downstream data analysis, often using innovative data analysis pipelines. Significant economies of scale are
achieved by this centralization of resources. To provide for future needs of PCC members and remain state-of-
the-art, PRL is continuously improving, developing, and implementing new services via its highly trained staff
and updating instrumentation via generous institutional support. PRL is overseen by the Division of Advanced
Research Services, solicits frequent surveys from PCC members, and consults an Advisory Board. PRL
achieves its mission via four Specific Aims: 1) To provide MS-based state-of-the-art proteomics technologies,
complete downstream data analysis and storage support to PCC members. These technologies include, but are
not limited to, quantitative mass spectrometry using label and label-free strategies, identification and
quantification of post-translational-modifications, and characterization of protein complexes; 2) To provide highly
customized project support tailored to the specific research questions and needs of individual PCC members,
including method(s) development and/or unique data analysis strategies for these applications, 3) To
continuously implement and develop novel proteomics techniques and, as needed, secure new instrumentation
to ensure continued availability of state-of-the-art proteomics technology to PCC members, 4) To provide
education to graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and principal investigators on proteomics techniques
by participating in graduate student teaching, departmental seminars, and extensive pre- and post-project
consultation and collaboration."

Physician-neuroscientists are essential for converting the discoveries from the laboratory to diagnostic and
therapeutic strategies for persons burdened by neurologic diseases. Integration of research training during
clinical training years (residency and fellowship) is pivotal to fostering the next generation of physician-
neuroscientists, who are essential to bring the neuro-based discoveries to the bedside. The University of
Pittsburgh (Pitt) has an exceptionally strong neuroscience environment, primed to help address this gap through
the Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Neuropathology Pittsburgh Research Education Program (N3-PREP).
N3-PREP will be based in the Departments of Neurology and Neurosurgery and Division of Neuropathology, with
a focus on trainees with a desire to develop an academic research career in the neurosciences. Our overarching
and long-term goal is to train the next generation of physician-neuroscientists in basic science, translational
science, data science, and clinical (patient-oriented) research through a closely mentored approach, in an
environment ripe with physical and faculty resources across the translational spectrum of neuro-focused
research. Biomedical research is a high priority at Pitt and the neuroscience environment is strong, with faculty
across >20 departments and institutes, and cutting-edge research. Currently at Pitt, the Clinical Translational
Science Institute (CTSI) and Physician Scientist Incubator (PSI) program provide important infrastructure for
training physician-scientists. In addition, career development programs include focused programs for enhancing
inclusion of underrepresented minority groups. Key components of N3-PREP include a well-defined pathway for
each trainee to be paired with a primary mentor and a mentoring committee, a core curriculum, internal study
sections for grant reviews, progress tracking for both the trainee and mentor, and continued support for the
trainee’s progress toward an NIH K mentored-career development award. We will also provide a longitudinal
track beginning in the PGY-1 year to increase the interest of the matriculating residents across participating
departments, transform the culture, and ultimately increase a diverse pool of residents well-prepared to get the
most out of the benefits of direct R25 funding. The core curriculum includes formal training in experimental design
and scientific rigor, statistical methodology, grant writing, presentation skills, DEI principles, and the responsible
conduct of research. Led by multi-Principal Investigators in Neurology, Neurosurgery and Neuropathology and
an Advisory committee, N3-PREP is well supported by commitments from 87 research mentors across 16
departments. Our hypothesis is that N3-PREP will increase the number of well-prepared neuro-focused
physician-scientists from the University of Pittsburgh who will progress to being at the forefront of guiding
innovative neuroscience research, translating research breakthroughs into care, and bring neuroscience
discoveries to life to reduce the burden of neurologic disease."
10770407,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rapid Weight Gain (RWG; >+0.67 change in weight-for-age Z-score) during the first 6 months of life is a strong
determinant of early life and persistent obesity, and cardiometabolic diseases. Obesity affects 18.5% of American
children aged 2-19 years and 8.1% of those <2 years. While short sleep duration and poor sleep quality are
important early risk factors for the development of childhood obesity and are major targets of national prevention
efforts, their impact on early RWG is less understood. Sleep-wake patterns in infancy, such as the development
of the 24-hr circadian sleep-wake rhythm, an important neurological milestone, may be especially important for
influencing risk of RWG. Disruptions to circadian sleep-wake rhythmicity are associated with greater adiposity
and its development primarily occurs in the first 6 months of life, the same critical, predictive timeframe as RWG.
The human gut microbiome (GM) is also established during this time to promote growth through energy
harvesting and metabolic signaling. Emerging data suggest that sleep may alter the GM and infant metabolism,
which ultimately may impact obesity. To date, most GM research has focused on the independent effects of
vaginal vs. cesarean birth delivery, antibiotic use, and breastfeeding vs. formula feeding on childhood obesity
risk. However, evidence is limited on if sleep-wake pattern and GM development interact to influence RWG.
Broadening our understanding of the GM role in obesity risk in early life to include the establishment of sleep-
wake patterns will improve our ability to intervene at a young age and prevent the onset of obesity. Therefore,
we propose to prospectively follow 192 mother-infant pairs prenatally through 12 months (3 weeks, 8 weeks, and
3, 6, 9 and 12 months) of life and assess the magnitude and timing of infant sleep-wake patterns and GM
development as predictors of RWG. This project will implement a novel conceptual framework that incorporates
the GM and sleep-wake patterns as metabolic contributors for RWG. The underlying theoretical and analytical
framework of this work will be based on the Ecological Model of Growth (EMG) that focuses on child, maternal,
family, and environmental factors that contribute to a child’s growth and combines human ecology and
epidemiology to evaluate broader interactions among these factors that influence child health outcomes. EMG
factors will be included as covariates in models of sleep and GM development on RWG. Our study will address
the following aims: 1- Investigate associations of infant sleep-wake patterns with subsequent RWG at 6 months
and weight gain at 12 months using time-varying effect models; 2- Investigate associations of GM development
with RWG at 6 months and weight at 12 months; and 3- Evaluate whether temporal interactions exist between
infant sleep-wake patterns and GM development, and if these relations influence RWG. Project findings will
inform future clinical interventions that include sleep and GM approaches to reduce the risk of RWG in infancy.
This pipeline of work will ultimately lead to the development of evidence-based guidelines for sleep and GM
development to prevent obesity through the identification of crucial developmental time intervals for RWG."

Chronic nonhealing wounds are debilitating with high morbidity and mortality. It is widespread and costly to
treat (e.g. ~ $15 billion/year for venous leg ulcers in the United States alone). Despite extensive efforts to
develop therapeutic strategies for effective treatment of chronic wounds, so far, limited clinical success has
been achieved. Currently available devices and products are designed only to target one or more complex
impaired cellular and molecular functions in chronic wounds.
The increasing clinical significance and medical and social responsibilities to treat and cure chronic skin
wounds are driving the demand for development of efficiently designed and fabricated wound-healing devices.
A system that not only possesses the physico-mechanical properties of skin, but also corrects or avoids the
impaired molecular and cellular machinery of chronic wounds, including angiogenesis, epithelial migration and
cell proliferation, unresolved inflammation, and infection, would be a major advance.
The proposed research project is aimed to develop a multifunctional patch with a unique capacity to resume
bodies' capacity to heal chronic wounds. In this regards, we develop a nanoextrusion approach to fabricate a
multifunctional nanofibrous composite patch capable of addressing the main challenges associated with the
healing process of chronic wounds, including i) providing a suitable environment in which cells can easily
proliferate and form new blood vessels; ii) preventing or reducing existing bacterial infection using ferumoxytol
nanoparticles with and without protein corona; and iii) minimizing unbalanced and prolonged inflammation. We
plan to homogeneously incorporate multi-functional biomolecules (e.g., follistatin-like 1, Ac2-26, and
ferumoxytol nanoparticles) within its fibrous framework to accelerate angiogenesis and cell proliferation, while
minimizing the risk of bacterial infection and prolonged inflammation. A wide range of in-vitro and in-vivo
therapeutic efficacy of the novel patches will be conducted. For the in-vivo experiments, we use a rat models of
diabetes provided by Charles River to probe the therapeutic and antibacterial efficacy of the patch. Involved
mechanisms of the cell and immune system interactions with the multifunctional patch will be identified using a
wide range of analysis including advanced electron microscopy.
This study will pave the way for the development of new tissue engineering scaffolds to improve the body's
natural (endogenous) repair mechanisms by redirecting impaired healing pathways, thus providing a unique
opportunity to repair and regenerate damaged skin and tissue in a wide range of chronic wounds."

Great advances have been made in improving health in the US, but substantial gender disparities remain.
Compared to men, women are more likely to be obese and are at greater risk of physical disabilities. Excessive
weight gain during pregnancy and the physiological and physical demands of pregnancy and lactation lead
many women to accrue substantial body fat while experiencing a variety of nutrient deficiencies, reproductive-
related diseases, and mental health challenges. These and other health disparities are even greater in margin-
alized populations, particularly those with inadequate healthcare and/or living in poverty – a situation common
in Idaho. Much of Idaho is characterized as ‘frontier and remote’ due to sparce population and poor access to
basic goods and service. Idaho has the fewest physicians per capita of any state, and many Idahoans live in
poverty and are food insecure. This ‘perfect storm’ puts vulnerable Idaho women at risk for even greater health
disparities. There are complex factors driving these health inequities, but inadequate nutrition is one of the
most interwoven, unifying themes. Our overarching goal is to develop an internationally recognized COBRE
in Nutrition and Women’s Health at the University of Idaho. This COBRE will support a critical mass of feder-
ally funded, multidisciplinary scientists who will contribute to knowledge of and improve evidence-based nutri-
tional practices for women. Participating investigators and their students will study various aspects of nutrition
and women’s health, particularly during critical periods of growth, development, and senescence. Studies will
address situations characterized by limited resources and other environmental, physical, and identity-based
challenges to health and wellbeing that often have nutritional underpinnings and consequences. We will build
institutional capacity by harnessing, supporting, and expanding current strengths and expertise of faculty and
facilities at the University of Idaho and the region. We will also aggressively recruit new faculty with comple-
mentary research interests to join our synergistic team. We will accomplish our goals through three aims: 1)
establish and administer a multi-component center in nutrition and women’s health that enables multidiscipli-
nary research collaboration, 2) promote multidisciplinary synergistic research in nutrition and women’s health
that propels junior faculty to research independence, and 3) expand the impact of this COBRE to increase sus-
tainable, transdisciplinary research in and dissemination of knowledge in nutrition and women’s health at the
University of Idaho and the state of Idaho. The proposed COBRE in Nutrition and Women’s Health is signifi-
cant because it will create a culture of multi- and transdisciplinary collaboration and establish a nucleus of re-
search excellence around our theme. This COBRE is innovative because it will be uniquely focused on nutri-
tion and women’s health. This COBRE will be impactful through discoveries and advances in women’s health
that will benefit all women, while particularly addressing those in underserved and marginalized populations.
Our work in Idaho will have far reaching implications, as the state is similar to much of the rural, western US."

tions, and faculty mentoring. It will be integrally involved in recruiting, hiring, and retaining new faculty to build a
critical mass of scientists conducting federally funded research in nutrition and women’s health at the Uni-
versity of Idaho. It will propel emerging investigators to achieve research independence, build a critical mass of
scientists in this theme, and establish a new, vibrant research core facility, the Nutrition Analytics Core La-
boratory (NACL). The Administrative Core will be highly organized, and its functions and processes transpar-
ent. The leader of the COBRE and the Administrative Core will be PD/PI Dr. Michelle (Shelley) McGuire, an
internationally recognized nutrition expert with decades of experience leading large, multidisciplinary teams;
conducting research related to nutrition and women’s health; and mentoring emerging faculty engaged in nutri-
tion research. There will be an Advisory Committee, comprised of five highly qualified members, that will ad-
vise PD/PI McGuire in areas of scientific excellence, critique RPLs’ progress towards their milestone expecta-
tions, evaluate the research core business plan and service to users, review/award Pilot Project grants, and
review/approve replacement research project proposals and associate RPLs. There are five aims: 1) provide
day-to-day oversight required for this COBRE to fully reach its goals, including organizing scientific and career
development activities, preparing programmatic and financial reports, ensuring all activities are in comply with
state and federal regulations, and managing budgets; 2) provide clear RPL Developmental Plans for continued
professional development of RPLs that include specific milestones to transition to research independence; 3)
establish and oversee a Pilot Project Program and Technology Access Grants to identify, promote, and support
new investigators in the area of nutrition and women’s health; 4) based on continuous formative and summa-
tive strategies, provide annual evaluations of this COBRE and implement recommendations of the Advisory
Committee for ongoing improvements; and 5) communicate findings from this COBRE and other relevant re-
search related to nutrition and women’s health to stakeholders in Idaho. This Phase 1 COBRE will build institu-
tional critical mass and capacity in nutrition and women’s health research with the goal of establishing an inter-
national reputation within this scientific theme. The collective efforts will be significant and innovative because
they will support the only NIH COBRE solely focused on both nutrition and women’s health. Our results will
be impactful, as this topic directly affects all Idaho women and more than half the US (and global) population
and indirectly influences us all through improving the lives of women. Our work in Idaho [much of which is char-
acterized as ‘frontier and remote’ (FAR) due to sparce population and poor access to basic goods and ser-
vices] will have far reaching implications, as the state is similar to much of the rural, western US."

Fundamental to effectively studying nutrition and women’s health is having access to equipment and expertise
needed for nutritional status and health assessment. This includes equipment for various measurements of
anthropometry (e.g., weight, body composition), biochemical measurements (e.g., blood chemistries), clinical
assessments (e.g., signs and symptoms of nutritional deficiencies), and dietary assessments (e.g., food record
analysis). In addition, many researchers studying nutrition use indirect calorimetry and stable isotope method-
ology, and those conducting dietary intervention studies require the use of a kitchen. Our long-term goal is to
support a critical mass of multidisciplinary scientists synergistically studying nutrition and women’s health at the
University of Idaho. A primary objective in this Phase 1 COBRE Research Core is to establish a new and
unique Nutrition Analytics Core Laboratory (NACL). The NACL will be comprised collectively of 1) a unique
main suite of laboratories serving as its ‘hub’ and 2) a network of satellite laboratories and associated ‘Faculty
Subject Matter Experts.’ The main NACL hub laboratory suite will be comprised of a Wet Chemistry Labora-
tory, a Computer Laboratory, a Body Composition Laboratory, a Resting Metabolic Rate Laboratory, and a
Metabolic Kitchen. The NACL’s hub and satellite laboratories will be easily accessible by all faculty and staff
looking to leverage their broad capacities for research related to nutrition and women’s health. We will accom-
plish our goal through three aims: 1) establish the NACL, a new and unique research facility to serve the scien-
tific needs of the research projects in this COBRE for Nutrition and Women’s Health, 2) operate the NACL us-
ing best practices that include a comprehensive business plan, and 3) open the NACL to all COBRE and non-
COBRE scientists. PD/PI McGuire will provide broad oversight to the NACL which will be directed by Dr. Janet
Williams. Day-to-day operations will be overseen by a dedicated Research Support Specialist. The COBRE in
Nutrition and Women’s Health, including the NACL, will build institutional critical mass and capacity in nutri-
tion and women’s health research with the goal of establishing an international reputation within this scientific
theme. The NACL is innovative in that it builds a comprehensive facility that will eventually address nearly all
aspects of data collection and analyses pertinent to nutrition research. It will span the needs of scientists con-
ducting basic biological experiments to those focused on social or behavioral aspects of nutrition and those
developing novel computational approaches to understand the impacts of nutrition on women’s health across
the lifespan. The NACL will be impactful because it will allow University of Idaho researchers and regional col-
laborators unparalleled ability to study the broad range of nutrients, physiological conditions (e.g., growth,
pregnancy, lactation, exercise, weight loss or gain, aging), and health outcomes that encompass our theme of
nutrition and women’s health."

Obesity, defined as excessive adipose tissue (>30% of body weight for women and >20% of body weight for
men), is a national health crisis impacting individuals of all ages. While body mass index (BMI; body
weight/height2; kg/m2) is the primary measure of obesity in epidemiological studies and medical practice, this
measure fails to identify 50% of those with genuine excess adiposity. Consequently, there is a hidden popula-
tion of individuals with high body fat who are misclassified as nonobese via BMI (healthy BMI considered to be
18.5-24.9 kg/m2). These individuals are described as ‘normal weight obese’ (NWO). NWO individuals likely
have the same elevated risks for comorbidities (e.g., metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, cardiovascular dis-
ease, hypertension, and dyslipidemia) as those correctly classified as obese. The prevalence of body fat mis-
classification among females is likely exaggerated in rural communities, where risk of true obesity is elevated
above national averages. This is in part because people living in rural areas tend to have limited access to
healthcare, fitness facilities, community centers, and evidence-based information regarding nutrition and physi-
cal fitness. Much of Idaho is classified as being in the ‘frontier and remote’ (FAR) West with most (80%) coun-
ties classified as rural. Currently, 31% of Idahoan women are classified as obese based on BMI, a number that
almost certainly underestimates true obesity due to NWO. Our preliminary data show high levels of NWO in
physically active college-aged women living in Idaho, and we hypothesize that rates are much higher in the
general population of women and that this is associated with poor health outcomes. The aims of the study pro-
posed here are significant because they address these important questions and will explore factors associated
with NWO risk. Briefly, we will conduct an epidemiological study of premenopausal women documenting rigor-
ous measurements of dietary intake, physical activity and exercise behaviors, perceptions of body image, body
composition and circumferences, muscular strength and endurance, aerobic fitness, metabolic health, oxida-
tive stress, inflammation, and menstrual health. Additionally, we will compare the physical and physiological
outcomes between NWO and NWL premenopausal females. Our central hypothesis is that premenopausal
females with poor diet quality and avoidance of resistance exercise are more likely to be categorized as NWO,
and that these women have suboptimal physical and physiological health. These aims are innovative and sig-
nificant because they will yield novel data related to lifestyle behaviors most strongly associated with NWO in
premenopausal females living in a rural area. Idaho’s population is representative of similar vast regions
across the entire West, so this study’s ramifications for future targeted interventions have implications for
many. This work is impactful as it will likely unveil an underrecognized health condition with potential lifetime
consequences among seemingly healthy young women and is the first step in designing randomized, con-
trolled intervention trials to study mechanisms and treatments."

This proposal outlines a comprehensive plan for graduate education in chemistry & biology at UW–Madison
via the Chemistry-Biology Interface training (CBIT) program. We seek to provide cross-disciplinary research
training to our students, so that chemists and biologists not only appreciate, but also use, the tools and
techniques developed by each other. These types of fresh approaches can lead to meaningful and truly
impactful breakthroughs in science. The overall objective of CBIT is to educate trainees so they understand and
can articulate scientiﬁc problems that span the chemistry–biology interface, have the technical skills to realize
an independent research project at this interface, and can communicate their discoveries to diverse audiences.
CBIT’s speciﬁc objective is to maximize Ph.D. completion rates within our 5 core departments/programs and
measure longitudinal student outcomes (as per degree completion and job placement in the biomedical
workforce) that will advance best practices in biomedical graduate training overall. CBIT’s overall & speciﬁc
objectives are shaped by our mission to cultivate an inclusive, safe, and engaged community of
cross-disciplinary scholars that is fostered by strong communication and teamwork. To realize these
objectives, we request funds to support the CBIT program at the level of 10 trainees/year, with each trainee
funded for 2 years. Key features of our proposed program are underscored below:
● The CBIT program will provide an integrated set of coursework (foundational and area speciﬁc, with
 dedicated courses in ethics and research rigor), research experiences that span the frontiers of the chemical
 biology ﬁeld, mentorship training, focused training in communication (with mentors, other scientists, and
 the public), substantive career development opportunities (internships, annual workshops, and IDPs), and
 team-based and community-building experiences (via courses, research, and outreach).
● We will provide trainees a pale e of four professional skill sets aligned with diﬀerent biomedical careers
 (academic, industry, government, and legal/non-proﬁt), guided by the needs of current employers within
 the biomedical workforce (via consultation with our new External Advisory Board), and composed of
 diﬀerent activities that are speciﬁcally tailored for success in these four career spaces.
● We will evaluate our ability to achieve these results through quantitative assessments of the outcomes of
 the CBIT program, including gains in science identity, science self-eﬃcacy, and core graduate school
 competencies such as broad knowledge of a discipline, experimental skills, and critical thinking skills.
Our CBIT program ﬁlls a unique niche at UW–Madison as the only T32 program centered in the chemical
sciences. This interfacial program has signiﬁcantly impacted student outcomes—notably, of our 57 CBIT
Ph.D. graduates since 2008, 55 (96%) are in careers that directly impact human health. We will build on this
strong history and continue to innovate in graduate education over the next 5 years."

In 2007, some pets became ill and a few died as the result of consuming contaminated pet food.
An investigation revealed that the incident was due to melamine, an adulterant found in the
contaminated pet food. Melamine was also found in tainted animal feed that was used for farm
animal and fish. Some food animals that ate the tainted feed were processed into human food.
This event had major implications for animal and human health. In recognition of the event and
its consequences, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) sought out cooperative
agreements with veterinary diagnostic laboratories to enable analysis of animal diagnostic
samples and animal food/drug products in the event that laboratory surge capacity resulting
from large-scale outbreak or threat incident is needed. Participating laboratories have increase
surge capacity and have prepared for analysis related to microbiological or chemical
contamination, either through intentional or unintentional means. This consortium of laboratories
is useful for the detection and surveillance of animal feeds or other large-scale outbreaks, so as
to halt an event early and reduce consequences. The emergent of SARS-CoV-2 virus in 2019
was a public health need that was not identified at the time of our original Vet-LIRN award. The
susceptibility of multiple animal species including household pets to the virus generated an
unknown threat to public health, and warrant investigation to bridge the knowledge gap of the
virus at the human-pet/animal interface. This application is to continue the Wisconsin Veterinary
Diagnostic Laboratory’s (WVDL) commitment to this cooperative agreement and to establish
rapid communication with Vet-LIRN to increase the government’s ability to examine samples
from animals adversely affected by contaminated or adulterated products. Examination of such
samples can contribute to overall food safety as animal food events could signal potential issues
in the human food system. The University of Wisconsin (UW)- Madison, Wisconsin Veterinary
Diagnostic Laboratory (WVDL) is fully accredited by the American Association of Veterinary
Laboratory Diagnosticians (AAVLD), and thus, has the personnel with necessary experience,
technical expertise and necessary infrastructure to participate in method standardization,
training, proficiency testing, and deployment of new equipment to accomplish the task described
above with relative ease. The WVDL has participated in several proficiency test and intra-
laboratory comparison exercises (ICE) in the past 5 years and has participated in other funding
opportunities included the purchase, implementation and utilization of the Illumina iSeq 100
sequencing platform and SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology testing."

 This proposal will interrogate pre-synaptic release properties in vivo in order to extend observations made
in reduced system to the awake brain. Release probability (P(r)) varies greatly between synapses.
Understanding this fundamental feature of neurotransmission has implications for several basic and translational
aspects of neuroscience: P(r) serves as gating node for information transfer between neurons and an
understanding of P(r) is required to understand information flow; P(r) is implicated in maintaining healthy network
activity; understanding dynamic regulation of P(r) will enhance understanding of plasticity within the healthy
brain. This aligns with the mission of NINDS by contributing to an understanding of healthy physiology which
may become perturbed in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. I will use novel imaging methods to
investigate spatiotemporal P(r) regulation and how it is altered by arousal and neuromodulatory systems.
 P(r) is a core determinant of how information flow from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic cells (Fernandez-
Chacon et al. 2001, Kaeser et al. 2013, Korber et al. 2016). In vitro and ex vivo experiments have revealed a
wealth of information on how P(r) is dynamically regulated by various neuromodulatory and circuit functions
(Higley et al. 2009, Munoz et al. 2014) and how it differs for synapses formed by the same axon (Reyes et al.
1998, Markram et al. 1998, Koester et al. 2005, Martinetti et al. 2022). The overall goals addressed in aims 1 of
this proposal are to extend these observations to the awake, behaving brain by leveraging novel tools.
 In addition to functions localized at the synapse, global behavioral state as measured by pupil diameter,
whisking, and locomotion has been extensively studied in relation to cortical dynamics and neuromodulation via
acetylcholine (ACh) (Vinck et al. 2015; Lohani et. al. 2021; Benisty et al. 2021; Tang and Higley 2020; McCormick
et al. 2020). Further, ACh interacts directly with muscarinic receptors on pre-synaptic terminals to influence
glutamate release in part via Gi/o coupled signaling (Maeda et al. 2020; Higley et al. 2009; Guo et al. 2012).
Leveraging the ability to quantify P(r) in vivo, I will probe interactions between state, ACh, and P(r) at cortical
synapses during behavior. Aim 2 will interrogate behavioral state and ACh mediated neuromodulation.
 The laboratory of Dr. Higley is an excellent environment in which to conduct this investigation. Dr. Higley
has extensive experience with synaptic release and plasticity as well as in vivo imaging methods. In addition,
the Neuroscience Department at Yale boasts a highly-collaborative set of leading experts on synaptic physiology
and biochemistry who will serve as advisors and mentors concurrent with the goals of the Training Plan herein."

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) that are clinically and pathologically similar display significant differences in
disease progression, therapeutic response, and overall survival. The limited accuracy of current prognostic
biomarkers is a major unmet clinical need, particularly in a tumor type rapidly rising in prevalence and incidence.
While genetic drivers have been identified, these genetic alterations are limited to cancer cells and do not provide
a systematic assessment of information encoded within the intact tumor microenvironment (TME), including the
role of the tumor architecture and the spatially organized immunological processes. For example, while emerging
evidence proposes a key role for tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in orchestrating an
immunosuppressive TME, patient-specific factors that mediate cell-to-cell interactions and localized chemokine
and cytokine signaling in NETs are currently unknown. To address this knowledge gap, work from our group on
single-cell transcriptomic profiling of NETs has established that TAMs display an adverse continuum of cell states
(i.e. not separated into the historical M1 or M2 groupings), while expressing tumor-specific chemokines and
cytokines involved in regulating key immune pathways. Our findings highlight the significant heterogeneity within
the myeloid compartments of NETs, particularly TAMs, and may offer potential promising targets for prognosis
and therapy. However, unlocking this potential requires the systematic understanding of the spatial distributions
and interactions of these different macrophage cell populations with both the cancer cell and lymphoid cell
populations, which together - as a multi-cellular system - dictate immunosuppression or activation. These
intricate spatial insights are still majorly lacking and obtaining them is only recently possible with the advent of
new spatial technologies. To understand the underlying processes that drive NET progression, as well as reveal
potential therapeutic vulnerabilities, we will test our hypothesis across two mutually reinforcing aims. In Aim 1,
we will identify the exact spatial composition, architecture and cellular crosstalk of the tumor and TME of archival
NETs and connect the obtained information with macrophage-centric signaling and processes. In Aim 2, we will
determine if systematic spatial distributions and interactions of the macrophage cell populations and NET-
specific chemokine profiles are associated with disease outcomes in NETs. The successful implementation of
the proposed studies could provide innovative and data-driven insights into complex macrophage biology and
concurrently establish high-dimensional profiling of the TME as clinical biomarkers, thereby transforming
prognostic stratification and clinical management for patients with NETs and potentially identifying novel
druggable targets within the tumor as a whole."
10872231,"Obesity causes multiple complications including hypertension, type 2 diabetes and sleep disordered breathing
(SDB), which contribute to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Obesity and its complications are linked to
increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The carotid bodies (CB) modulate afferent input to
the SNS and have been identified as a potential therapeutic target. CB denervation abolished hypertension and
hyperglycemia. The robust CB hypoxic chemoreflex has been implicated in respiratory instability and increased
loop gain, one of the cardinal traits of SDB. Our long-term goal is to develop novel therapeutics, which will
treat hypertension, diabetes and SDB in obesity by modulating the CB activity. During the first funding
period of the award, we discovered a unique pathway by which adipose-tissue-produced hormone leptin acts in
CB to increase the hypoxic chemoreflex and induce hypertension. Leptin interacts with the long isoform of leptin
receptor, LEPRb, on CB type I cells to activate transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) cation channel.
This mechanism increases carotid sinus nerve (CSN) activity and the chemoreflex, which ultimately leads to
SDB, hypertension and perturbations of glucose metabolism. We developed novel molecular approaches to
interrogate the CB leptin-TRPM7 pathway targeting Leprb gene expression, signaling via the JAK/STAT3 and
PI3K and targeting leptin resistance induced by suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) and protein tyrosine
phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that, in DIO, leptin acts via
TRPM7 in the CB type I cells to increase the hypoxic chemoreflex and CSN activity leading to SNS
activation, hypertension, diabetes, and SDB, all of which can be treated by our novel TRPM7 blocker.
We will examine the role of the leptin-TRPM7 axis in CB in obesity-induced hypertension, diabetes (Specific
Aim 1) and SDB (Specific Aim 2) in mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO). We propose that leptin acts via CB
TRPM7 to increase SNS activity inducing hypertension and hyperglycemia and to augment the chemoreflex
causing SDB, which will be abolished by (A) Leprb shRNA and (B) Trpm7 shRNA applied to CB; (C) TRPM7
blocker FTY720 in a novel extended release formulation administered to the CB; and that (D) LEPRb blocker
Allo-aca and TRPM7 blocker FTY720 administered to CB will decrease CSN, phrenic, splanchnic and renal
sympathetic nerve activity. Specific Aim 3 will examine the cellular and molecular regulation of LEPRb-TRPM7
signaling in CB of DIO mice. We propose that in DIO, high leptin levels increase TRPM7 activity in CB glomus
cells (A) acutely via JAK2/PI3K signaling; (B) chronically by increasing Leprb and Trpm7 gene expression via
the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. We will employ state-of-the-art techniques including in vivo manipulation of gene
expression in CB with viral vectors, FTY720 hydrogel molecular assembly, telemetry recording, sleep studies
with quantified analysis of breathing, CB type I cell patch clamping and sympathetic nerve recording. Our
translational proposal will identify potential novel treatment of hypertension, diabetes and SDB in obesity."
10782906,"Abstract
 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most important human pathogens. Globally, there are approximately
300 million people that are chronically infected by this virus, resulting in nearly 1 million deaths every year. The
current treatments for chronic HBV patients rely mostly on nucleos/tide analogs (NAs), which include entecavir,
tenofovir and telbivudine. These NAs, which target the viral reverse transcriptase, have little effect on the viral
genome in the nucleus of infected hepatocytes and do not suppress viral gene expression. As such, they fail to
generate sustained response in the vast majority of HBV patients. We have recently discovered that the cytokine
interleukin-1β (IL-1β) can effectively suppress HBV gene expression by downregulating the expression of
PPARα and FOXO3, which are two transcription factors critical for HBV gene expression. The ability of IL-1β to
shut down HBV gene expression raises the possibility that IL-1β may be used as a novel therapeutic agent to
treat HBV patients, as the loss of HBV gene expression and the consequent loss of circulating HBV surface
antigen (HBsAg) may result in the appearance of antibodies directed against HBsAg to result in “functional cure”
and may even lead to the activation of CD8+ T cells to result in the removal of HBV-infected hepatocytes. In this
application, we will explore these possibilities. In addition, our preliminary data indicated that repaglinide, an
FDA-approved diabetes drug that was found to inhibit the binding of FOXO3 to its target DNA sequence, could
suppress HBV gene expression. For that reason, we will also test whether rapaglinide can be repurposed to treat
HBV patients. During the R21 phase of this application, we will use PXB cells, which are human hepatocytes
isolated from humanized PXB mice, for HBV infection studies. We will also use HBV transgenic mice to test the
aniviral effects of IL-1β and rapaglinide. During the R33 phase, we will use a mouse model with persistent HBV
replication that we recently developed to study the antiviral effects of IL-1β and repaglinide and host immune
responses. If it is necessary, we will also generate repaglinide derivatives to improve its efficacy against HBV.
In addition, we will use humanized FRG mice to test the anti-HBV effects of IL-1β, repaglinide and their combined
use with entecavir. The success of our proposed studies will lead to novel therapeutics for the treatment of HBV
patients."
10782866,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Suicide is a global public health concern that marks an extreme along a spectrum of self-inflicted injury (SII)
and is the leading cause of death among adolescents. Although we have evidence-based interventions for
youth SII, mechanisms of change are underexplored, and suicide rates have not appreciably declined.
Efficacious treatments like Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) are intensive, expensive, and require extensive
therapist training, making it inaccessible for many adolescents in need. We also lack vital data on whether and
how adolescents apply and retain therapeutic skills in daily life. There are too few researchers interested in and
trained to develop mechanistic innovations in this area. The candidate will complete training in the neural
underpinnings of skill acquisition (fMRI, Training Aim 1), measurement in everyday life (Ecological momentary
assessment; EMA, Training Aim 2), and factors (life stress) that may impede skill acquisition (Training Aim 3).
This training is embedded within a research study that uses a rigorous multi-method approach to: compare
intra- vs. interpersonal skills targeting emotion dysregulation (Aim 1); assess the potency of intervention effects
in daily life (Aim 2); and examine persistence/decay effects of skill use in daily life following initial skill exposure
and a “booster” call (Aim 3). We will also examine bi-directional effects of life-stress and underlying
mechanisms of risk and change. Adolescents with a history of repeated SII (N = 100) will attend 4 study visits
with a parent. At Visit 1, participants will complete baseline assessments of psychiatric diagnoses, SII, and life
stress. Fifty-six of the 100 youth will be randomly assigned to complete fMRI paradigms to tap neural
processes underlying perspective taking and empathy, and approach/avoidance (Training Aim 1). Adolescents
will then complete a 2-week EMA (EMA1, Training Aim 2) to measure daily affect, perceived stressors, SII, and
suicidal thoughts. At Visit 2, dyads will be randomly assigned to learn and practice GIVE (interpersonal skills
training) or opposite-to-emotion action (OA; intrapersonal skill). We will assess behavioral, affective, and
physiological regulatory processes during two conflict discussions: (1) pre- skills training, and (2) post-training,
while dyads use their assigned skill. A second EMA period (EMA2) will assess skill use along with all variables
from EMA1. Dyads will return for Visit 3 to repeat fMRI assessment before crossing over to learn the alternate
skill ⎯ followed by another 2-week EMA (EMA3). Visit 4 is completed 6 months post-EMA3, where we will
reassess SII, symptom severity, and life stressors. The candidate has existing expertise in adolescent SII,
DBT, and cardiac psychophysiological measures of emotion regulation. The mentorship team will support her
in growing her skill set to include fMRI task design, data acquisition, and analysis, EMA methods and analysis,
and life stress assessment. By achieving the aims of this proposal, the candidate will develop a unique
program of research that can inevitably lead to more effective and targeted interventions for SII in youth."

Failure to adequately treat pain accounts for hundreds of billions of dollars of lost productivity and medical
expenses annually. According to the Centers for Disease Control, each day in the United States over forty people
die from an overdose of prescription pain killers (e.g. Vicodin and OxyContin). Consequently, there is an urgent
need to develop new, safe, and potent non-opioid analgesics for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Many
surgical procedures induce significant acute pain that is difficult to treat. Patients who undergo such major
surgical procedures are also at an increased risk of developing a subsequent opioid addiction. Therefore,
improving acute pain control will not only enhance patient outcomes but may also lead to reduced prevalence of
subsequent opioid abuse. The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) produces analgesia by activating
cannabinoid receptors. However, 2-AG can also be hydrolyzed by the enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL)
to generate arachidonic acid, the precursor to downstream eicosanoids that can promote pain. In a recent
publication, our group demonstrated that 2-AG levels were elevated in patients who developed greater acute
postoperative pain, suggesting that 2-AG/eicosanoid crosstalk may directly modulate acute pain in humans.
However, the contribution of 2-AG metabolism toward acute pain is poorly defined and its role in eicosanoid
biosynthesis and pain in humans is lacking, highlighting a major gap in our understanding of endocannabinoid
metabolism and pain. The current proposal leverages rodent surgical models and patient derived samples to test
the major hypothesis that MAGL activity is essential for the biosynthesis of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase
(5-LOX) derived eicosanoids, which we hypothesize operate in parallel to promote acute pain. In Aim 1, we will
employ complementary pharmacological and genetic approaches to test the hypothesis that MAGL inhibition
suppresses acute pain by depriving cyclooxygenase and 5-LOX enzymes of arachidonic acid for eicosanoid
biosynthesis within the incision site. This aim will also employ selective inhibitors and 5-LOX KO mice to test the
hypothesis that 5-LOX inhibition attenuates acute pain. Aim 2 will leverage novel conditional MAGL knockout
mice to identify peripheral cell populations wherein MAGL activity contributes to postoperative eicosanoid
biosynthesis and pain. Aim 3 will characterize 2-AG/eicosanoid crosstalk in perioperative human tissue and will
assess the contribution of 2-AG and eicosanoid levels toward acute pain in humans. The outcome of this study
will provide fundamental insights into endocannabinoid/eicosanoid crosstalk and may identify MAGL as a novel
target for the treatment of acute pain, thereby providing the foundation for the rapid translation of MAGL inhibitors
to patients suffering from inadequately controlled pain."
10783761,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Intracellular calcium drives neuronal signaling and excitability, and appropriate spatial and temporal control
of neuronal calcium signals are required to prevent dysregulated control of brain activity, which can lead to
epileptic seizures. One of the primary sources of calcium in neurons is entry via voltage-gated calcium channels
on the cell membrane, which is then coupled to various effector mechanisms through co-localization of
channels and calcium-responsive proteins within the neuron. Two specific, but distinct, calcium-dependent
processes critical for maintaining brain homeostasis involve retrograde endocannabinoid signaling and the
action potential afterhyperpolarization. Endocannabinoids are produced postsynaptically by neurons in a
calcium-dependent manner, and then diffuse to presynaptic terminals where they bind to CB1 receptors and
powerfully inhibit vesicle release at numerous synapses. Separately, voltage-dependent calcium entry activates
nearby coupled calcium-dependent potassium channels, mediating the action-potential afterhyperpolarization
which accelerates cell repolarization and controls neuronal firing rates. For each of these phenomena, tight
functional coupling of calcium entry to these disparate effectors is critical in maintaining brain function.
While the specific cellular mechanisms responsible for controlling the appropriate localization of voltage-gated
calcium channels remain largely unknown, our preliminary data indicate a critical role for the alpha2delta
proteins in the functional coupling of calcium entry to effectors. These auxiliary calcium channel subunits help
traffic voltage-gated calcium channels to the neuronal surface membrane, but have otherwise remained
enigmatic despite clear association with neurologic diseases in humans and mice. We hypothesize that the
alpha2delta proteins are critical mediators of functional coupling between calcium entry and calcium-
dependent signaling throughout the brain. We propose to use genetically modified mice and
electrophysiological assays to define the roles of alpha2delta isoforms in 1) calcium-dependent retrograde
signaling from cerebellar Purkinje cells to their various synaptic inputs, 2) the control of excitability and
endocannabinoid signaling in the hippocampus, and 3) the molecular mechanisms underlying these
phenomena using molecular replacement strategies. Together, these experiments will lead to a greatly
enhanced appreciation of the function of this important class of calcium channel subunits, which we believe
can be leveraged to improve our ability to control runaway excitability in the brain in conditions such as
epileptic seizures."

Plants have exceptional capacity to regenerate adult body parts after injury, providing an excellent
conceptual model for organ replacement. They can even rapidly reform their adult stem cell niches after
complete excision. My lab has pioneered new systems and techniques to study plant regeneration. We
developed methods for tracking cell identity of reprogramming cells using transcriptomic and live imaging
techniques during regeneration. In connection with this work, I have led efforts to introduce new
technologies like single-cell RNA-seq into plant research. Using these and other techniques developed
under NIGMS R01GM078279, we found that regenerating roots appear to recapitulate embryonic programs
during organ regeneration. The work has led to us to propose models of how this highly self-organizing
system orchestrates the regeneration of an entire organ and its stem cell niche. However, while new tools
like in single-cell RNA-seq provide powerful approaches to dissect developmental programs cell-by-cell,
they are largely silent on the role of cell-cell communication in mediating tissue assembly. Hence, our
current efforts are focused on developing new approaches to address this gap. In one proposed system, we
inducibly block symplastic (direct) communication channels in a cell type-specific manner and use single-
cell RNA-seq to test the consequences on neighboring and distant tissues during normal post-embryonic
organogenesis and regeneration (Block-Seq). This is akin to observing the consequences of signaling from
one cell to all its neighbors but not the signals themselves. One common mode of signaling in plants is the
protein-level movement of transcription factors from one cell to its neighbors. To track protein movement
comprehensively, we are developing a click chemistry approach to incorporate labeled amino acids in
specific cell types followed by capture and mass spectrometry of the mobile proteins in neighboring cell
types (the Mobilome). This approach is designed to reveal many of the signals that plant cells use to
organize development. Overall, these approaches are motivated by a basic question that underpins a
medically relevant question: how do positional signals generate a set of rules that allow the flawless
reconstruction of organs in regeneration?"

While sickle cell disease (SCD) is instigated by a mutant hemoglobin that polymerizes in hypoxia to cause
hemolysis and vaso-occlusion, inflammation plays a fundamental role in propagating this pathogenesis. SCD
patients are at significantly higher risk of thrombosis, which contributes to severe life-threatening complications
such as pulmonary hypertension and stroke. On a cellular level, it is well established that in SCD patients, platelet
activation is elevated and correlates with hemolysis. However, the contribution of inflammatory signaling to
platelet activation and its cross-talk with hemolysis remain unknown. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), an
inflammatory mediator released by cells, has been shown to be elevated in the blood of SCD patients and to
stimulate platelet activation. Notably, the ability of HMGB1 to mediate platelet activation is dependent on the
oxidation state of critical cysteine residues in the protein. Preliminary data shows that HMGB1-mediated platelet
activation is significantly enhanced in the presence of cell-free hemoglobin (Hb), a major component of
hemolysis. Further, Hb and HMGB1 each independently increase platelet mitochondrial reactive oxygen species
(mtROS) generation, a known stimulus for platelet activation. Based on these data, I hypothesize that in SCD,
Hb oxidizes HMGB1 to increase platelet mtROS production leading to platelet activation and secondary release
of additional thrombotic stimulants including HMGB1 from platelets. Aim 1 will determine whether Hb oxidizes
HMGB1 to potentiate its activation of platelets using human healthy and sickle Hb and platelets in ex vivo
experimental models. Aim 2 will determine the mechanism by which HMGB1-induced mtROS stimulates platelet
activation. Aim 3 will utilize murine models of hemolysis to determine whether neutralizing HMGB1 attenuates
platelet activation and thrombus formation. Successful completion of these aims will elucidate a novel
mechanism of synergy between hemolysis and inflammatory signaling in potentiating thrombosis. This work will
reveal novel therapeutic targets and potential therapeutics for the treatment of thrombosis in SCD. In addition,
this project, along with the guidance of my multi-disciplinary mentorship team, career development plan, and
cutting-edge research environment at the Vascular Medicine Institute at the University of Pittsburgh, will serve
as a strong training vehicle to facilitate my independence as a researcher focused on mechanisms of thrombosis
in hemolytic disease."
10783764,"Project Summary/Abstract
TP53 is the most common somatically mutated gene among all cancers as it is altered in up to 85% of head and
neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Although TP53 mutations often lead to a loss of wild-type p53 (wtp53)
function, many TP53 mutations confer mutant p53 (mutp53) gain-of-function (GOF), promoting cancer cell
genomic instability, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and cancer inflammation. However, the mechanisms
involved in mutp53 GOF activity remain largely elusive, which is a major obstacle to fully understanding and
targeting mutp53 to prevent tumorigenesis and tumor progression of HNSCC. Our long-term goal is to
understand the role of TP53 mutations in promoting tumorigenesis and tumor progression of HNSCC and to use
this knowledge to develop effective targeted therapies for HNSCC. The objective of this proposed research,
which is the next step in pursuit of that goal, is to identify the specific role of GOF mutp53 in the promotion of
chromosomal instability (CIN), which leads to tumor metastasis and immunosuppression, and to further exploit
this to design novel treatment strategies for HNSCC. Our central hypothesis is that by targeting MCM5, a
component of the replication licensing factor minichromosome maintenance 2-7 complex (MCM2-7), GOF
mutp53 predisposes cells to CIN that leads to a STING-dependent cytosolic DNA response involving
downstream activation of non-canonical nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cell (NF-κB)
signaling, which, in turn, promotes tumor cell invasion, metastasis, and immunosuppression; therefore, targeting
mutp53-mediated signaling can be used as a therapeutic strategy for HNSCC in patients with GOF TP53
mutations. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1)
Determine the functional roles of GOF mutp53-MCM5-cGAS/STING-non-canonical NF-κB signaling in the
promotion of tumor invasion and metastasis in HNSCC cells; 2) Determine the functional roles of GOF mutp53-
MCM5-cGAS/STING-non-canonical NF-κB signaling in the promotion of immunosuppression in HNSCC; 3)
Identify novel therapeutic strategies for HNSCC with GOF p53 mutations. The research proposed in this
application is highly innovative, given that the proposed mechanisms for studying GOF mutant p53 have never
been reported before. Our hypothesis is based on our strong preliminary results from a proteomic screen of the
mutp53 interactome, which uncovered a physical interaction between GOF mutp53 proteins and MCM5. We
expect that the proposed work will identify intrinsic mechanisms of mutp53-mediated GOF in the promotion of
genomic instability, metastasis, and immunosuppression that contribute to tumor development and tumor
progression of HNSCC. Given the high incidence of p53 mutations in HNSCC, the proposed research is expected
to have a significant impact on the public health burden of this deadly disease, and will help us develop novel
therapeutic strategies to treat HNSCC patients with TP53 mutations."

The identities and functions of cellular membrane-bound compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER), mitochondria, and synaptic vesicles, are largely determined by protein composition. Organelle
dysfunction and impaired membrane protein quality control (QC) are hallmarks of neurodegenerative disorders,
including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. Molecular-
level insights into the mechanisms that ensure high-fidelity membrane protein biogenesis are required to
understand how neurodegenerative diseases develop and identify effective treatments. All membrane proteins
face two fundamental biosynthetic challenges. First, they must localize to the correct cellular membrane.
Second, they must insert hydrophobic transmembrane domains into target membranes in the correct
orientation. It is not known how cells meet these basic biosynthetic requirements for the diverse membrane
proteins that make up 25-30% of the proteome. Using single-spanning membrane proteins as models, we have
established experimental systems of membrane protein biosynthesis and QC that are tractable for mechanistic
dissection. With these systems, we recently discovered that the ER-resident transporter ATP13A1 dislocates
mislocalized mitochondrial membrane proteins. Protein dislocation by ATP13A1 provides opportunities for
correct targeting and is required to maintain mitochondrial protein localization. In this proposal, we will leverage
ATP13A1 function as a molecular handle to study the mechanisms that lead to, recognize, and eliminate
aberrant proteins at the ER. In Aim 1, we will identify the biosynthetic factors that aberrantly insert
mitochondrial membrane proteins into the ER and determine how these mechanisms contribute to
mitochondrial protein homeostasis. In Aim 2, we will investigate the QC mechanisms that selectively recognize
and target mislocalized mitochondrial membrane proteins for ER-associated degradation (ERAD). In Aim 3, we
will investigate the topogenesis of type II membrane proteins that should insert into the ER with their N-
terminus in the cytosol. Because a subset of type II proteins is selectively destabilized by ATP13A1 depletion,
we hypothesize that these proteins harbor specific features prone to insertion in the wrong orientation, resulting
in the need for ATP13A1-mediated dislocation. Completion of this project will reveal mechanisms that mis-
insert membrane proteins into the ER, generate a mechanistic model of a mammalian ERAD pathway, and
shed light on how a handful of biosynthetic and QC factors handle a large and diverse clientele. Altogether,
these findings will reveal molecular-level insights into membrane protein QC target selection and mechanistic
principles underlying how cellular biosynthetic and QC mechanisms collaborate to ensure the integrity of
membrane protein biogenesis needed to preserve neuronal function."

Certain proteins misfold to form self-seeding prion-like aggregates associated with disease. We focus on one
such protein, TDP-43, the major protein associated with neuronal aggregates in several neurodegenerative
diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia and LATE. A prevalent TDP-
43 proteinopathy, LATE causes dementia often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). TDP-43 is also
found along with other proteins in AD and Parkinson’s neuronal inclusions. TDP-43 and other human misfold-
ing disease proteins form aggregates and inhibit growth in yeast. This allows yeast to be used to find therapeu-
tic targets. Remarkably, yeast genes that modify the toxicity of human misfolding disease proteins, including
TDP-43, identified both previously unknown and established human disease risk factors, demonstrating the
relevancy of the yeast model to human disease. We have used our expertise with yeast self-seeding prion pro-
teins to study human misfolding disease proteins with the yeast model. Now, we expect to learn how TDP-43
causes toxicity in yeast and, with the help of collaborators, in what ways our findings relate to TDP-43 toxicity
in higher cells and organisms. A central task is to identify the range of condensates, oligomers and aggregates
formed by TDP-43, and their toxicities. Determining which TDP-43 species is most toxic will advance under-
standing of toxicity mechanisms. As it is largely unknown what cellular functions are targeted by toxic TDP-43
species or the affiliated mechanisms, this work explores cellular targets of toxicity focusing on TDP-43 gain of
function toxicity. New models of therapeutic approaches will be developed by investigating if overexpression of
TDP-43 binding proteins can inhibit the formation of toxic TDP-43 species, if titration of essential or important
cellular proteins by TDP-43 toxic species contributes to toxicity, and if mutations in TDP-43 can protect wild-
type TDP-43 expressed in the same cell from forming toxic aggregates. Another gap to be addressed is why
TDP-43 is associated with different diseases. Importantly, as we showed for yeast prions, TDP-43 and other
disease proteins can misfold into different self-seeding aggregate variants/strains (not due to alterations in their
primary sequence), that have distinct characteristics. Thus, different variants of TDP-43 could affect neurons
differently, causing e.g. ALS vs. LATE. TDP-43 variants established in yeast would be important tools to iden-
tify disease specific variants and facilitate development of variant specific treatments. We will also investigate
the premise that entry into liquid-like granules is an upstream trigger of toxic species formation to learn if liquid-
like granules are therapeutic targets. Our approach will be to quantify the relationship between entry of prion
proteins into liquid condensates and stochastic formation of prions in yeast. Finally, we will examine the new
area of disease associated metabolite amyloid-like aggregates and the hypothesis that they nucleate prion-
like/disease protein misfolding, similar to our early demonstration of cross-seeding between yeast prions. This
work is expected to lead to new treatment approaches for protein misfolding diseases."

 Hispanics are 23% more likely to be obese than their White counterparts4, and obesity rates are higher in
Hispanic women than Hispanic men(45% vs. 39.7, respectively). It is estimated that 77% (or 15.5 million)
Hispanic women are overweight or obese. Obesity is driven by a variety of social, physical, and economic
factors, but is mainly due to poor diet and physical inactivity. Given this, most successful interventions that
reduce adiposity indices (e.g. BMI, weight, waist circumference) incorporate both diet and exercise. Successful
obesity interventions for Hispanics utilize cultural tailoring and have relied on promotores de salud (also
known as community health workers) as key facilitators in delivering these interventions. Promotores are
effective in delivering obesity interventions and promoting behavior change through enhanced motivation,
social support, social interaction and connectedness, and self-efficacy.
 However, adequate in-person promotora training is necessary for effective implementation of these
interventions. An in-person train-the-trainer (TTT) model is a laudable means of investing in promotores and
communities, yet, there remains barriers to access including family commitments and associated costs. Our
goal is to develop an effective, accessible, and scalable eHealth obesity intervention TTT for promotores.
 Comadres Saludables will combine both theory and evidence-based practices to provide promotores with
the self-efficacy, knowledge, and skills required to effectively implement an obesity intervention for Hispanic
women. Promotores will build their skillset through interactive quizzes, exercises, and video role-playing
scenarios. Additionally, Comadres Saludables will be the first web-based TTT to provide promotores with
interactive mHealth tools to enhance implementation with Hispanic women. Specifically, promotores will have
the option of texting or emailing program materials directly to the participant and will have access to fidelity
monitoring tools to ensure optimal implementation.
 In Phase I, a prototype of Comadres Saludables was developed, which was informed by formative
research conducted with 35 Latina promotores (bilingual) 18-64 years of age. The results of Phase I strongly
support the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the intervention, far exceeding the benchmarks established
in the Phase I proposal.
 During Phase II we will complete development of the web-based Comadres Saludables training for
promotores. In partnership with San Antonio Community Health Workers Association, we will examine the
effectiveness of the Comadres Saludables training to increase self-efficacy in implementing effective core
lifestyle intervention learning components for obesity interventions in Hispanics. Participants will be randomly
assigned to either the intervention condition or to a control condition. Secondary measures will assess
demographics, knowledge, attitudes, self-reported skill mastery, satisfaction, and utilization."
10783769,"Synaptic transmission leads to the activation of transcriptional programs in the postsynaptic cell that are critical
for long-lasting changes in synaptic refinement and plasticity. While the finding that abnormalities in this signaling
pathway are associated with human cognitive disorders underscores the importance of this activity-regulated
network for proper circuit function, elucidation of the precise role played by this form of regulation in the dynamic
modulation of specific synaptic connections within the context of a complex microcircuit has proven challenging.
Our laboratory has sought to address these issues in the context of the murine hippocampus, uncovering a role
for the activity-dependent transcription factor (TF) Npas4 in modulating inhibitory GABAergic inputs onto CA1
pyramidal cells. Building on these findings, we have recently characterized the differential regulation of
perisomatic inputs from parvalbumin (PV)- and cholecystokinin (CCK)-positive interneurons in response to
experience-driven neuronal activity, showing that this effect is dependent upon Npas4 action in the postsynaptic
pyramidal cell and identifying Scg2 as a novel activity-regulated mediator of these forms of inhibitory synaptic
plasticity. Taken together, these studies represent among the first insights into the mechanisms governing the
activity-regulated control of perisomatic inhibition. Moreover, we have found Npas4 functions in a cell-type-specific manner to differentially modulate the connectivity of neuronal cell types via the induction of distinct
neuronal cell-type-specific transcriptional programs. To gain insight into the basis of Npas4’s cell-type-specific
functions and further advance our understanding of its role in the control of activity-induced inhibitory synaptic
plasticity within the CA1 microcircuit, we propose (1) to investigate the mechanisms underlying cell-type-specific
Npas4-mediated gene regulation, and (2) to characterize the role of Scg2 in activity-dependent perisomatic
inhibitory plasticity. The proposed studies will advance our understanding of how this crucial microcircuit is
modified by experience, allow for new insights into the mechanisms by which activity-regulated gene expression
controls synaptic plasticity, and ultimately provide opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic
interventions to address a range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions."

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with focal atrophy of
the prefrontal and/or temporal lobes. FTD is the second most common form of dementia among people under
the age of 65. Many FTD-causing genes have been identified during the last decade, including CHMP2B,
GRN, C9ORF72, and TBK1. Some of these genes are also implicated in the motor neuron disease
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), paving the way for in-depth mechanistic investigation of pathogenic
processes in both disorders. In order to reveal common pathogenic mechanisms in different forms of FTD, it is
critically important to investigate both common and rare genetic mutations. To this end, in this application, we
will focus on the effects of FTD-causing mutations in CHMP2B and TBK1 on the functions of the endosomal-
lysosomal and autophagy pathways, two closely linked cellular pathways for degradation of transmembrane
and intracellular cargos. We will take advantage of strengths of different experimental systems including fruitfly
Drosophila, mouse models of FTD and cortical neurons differentiated from CRISPR-engineered induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This multidisciplinary approach will greatly enhance our understanding of
pathogenic mechanisms of FTD and reveal novel targets for therapeutic intervention."

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common cause of severe vision loss. Recent studies have
shown that a layer of capillaries called the choriocapillaris is affected in AMD, both in “dry” AMD in
which the blood vessels degenerate, depriving the retina of nourishment, and in “wet” AMD in which
the cells become activated to grow abnormally, damaging the retina. To a large extent the biochemical
changes in the choriocapillaris that accompany AMD are poorly understood. In this proposal we will
study how a gene that is affected by the complement system and is enriched in AMD cells contributes to
the processes associated with the choriocapillaris in AMD. We will also utilize a new technology (single
cell RNA-sequencing) to discover the molecular signatures of endothelial cells from the choroid at the
single cell level of resolution in health and different forms of AMD. A better understanding of how these
cells are altered in disease will provide insight into how to protect them from damage and death."

antigenic variation in subverting the host immune system. P. falciparum expresses a transmembrane protein that
is trafficked out of the parasite and into the membrane of the erythrocyte in which it resides. This protein, PfEMP1,
is essential to the parasite as it mediates binding of the infected erythrocyte to the host vasculature, thereby
preventing clearance by the spleen. At the same time, PfEMP1 is immunogenic and the host will mount an
adaptive immune response specifically targeting this protein. The parasite evades this response through the
expression of immunologically distinct isoforms of PfEMP1, each encoded by different members of the var
multicopy gene family. There are approximately 40-90 var genes encoded in the genome of any given parasite
isolate and they are expressed in a mutually exclusive fashion. While the epigenetic mechanisms controlling the
activation and silencing of var genes have been identified, little is known regarding the regulation of
transcriptional switching between genes. Due to the limited number of var genes available within the parasite
genome, purely stochastic switching between genes would likely result in premature expenditure of the antigenic
repertoire. Mathematical algorithms have provided models proposing an optimized switching network that
enables the parasite to efficiently utilize its full complement of var genes over the course of an infection. These
models have proposed a role for a “sink-node” within the network that coordinates transcriptional switching.
There is an increasing body of evidence that a highly conserved, unique var gene, var2csa, is the hypothesized
“sink-node”. var2csa encodes the PfEMP1 responsible for pregnancy associated malaria. Surprisingly, high
levels of var2csa transcripts are found in non-pregnant individuals, suggesting an additional role for this gene.
When the var2csa locus is deleted in cultured P. falciparum, the resulting parasites are unable to undergo a var
gene transcriptional switch, indicating the potential for var2csa to serve as the “sink-node.” This proposal looks
to uncover the mechanisms by which var2csa fulfills this second role in coordinating switching. var2csa is unique
in that it is the only var gene with a highly conserved upstream open reading frame (uORF). The presence of a
uORF is known to influence transcript stability, reduce downstream translation and can induce gene silencing.
Specific Aim 1 is designed to investigate the role of the uORF in modulating var2csa mRNA stability and
transcriptional activation through the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway. Specific Aim 2 will examine
the role of initiation factor conformation in regulating translation of the var2csa transcript. The phosphorylation
state of eIF2α can respond to altered nutrient levels, resulting in changes in translational initiation. Together, this
proposal will determine the role of the uORF in regulating var2csa’s proposed dual function."

Cognitive decline with aging, including Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), is a public health
imperative that impacts quality of life and disability. Survivors of acute surgical or medical illness contribute
greatly to the crisis of cognitive decline. Hospitalization confers a 1.5-2-fold increase in the odds of new onset
dementia. Furthermore, over a third of critically ill patients have new ADRD by 1 year. Major risk factors for
ADRD after acute illness include pre-illness frailty and cognitive deficits and delirium in the hospital. Endothelial
and blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, cerebral atrophy, and white matter connectivity changes have all
been linked to delirium and ADRD. Surgery is common in older adults but it (and its resulting hospitalization) is
associated with significant cognitive decline. Individual interventions to reduce this decline have exhibited
limited success. Prehabilitation is the process of enhancing capacity and reserve before an acute stressor to
improve tolerance of the upcoming insult. Older major surgical patients provide an ideal population for
prehabilitation. These patients have lead time prior to surgery, are frequently frail, have prolonged post-surgery
ICU and hospital courses, and are at high risk for new ADRD. Prehabilitation studies to date have primarily
focused on physical training to improve physical outcomes. Combined physical and computer-based cognitive
training programs have been associated with significant improvements in global cognitive function, and
computerized brain training exercises have demonstrated enhancement in memory, processing speed, and
multitasking. This training, however, has not been examined in surgical or hospitalized patients. We have
demonstrated that cognitive training and physical exercises are feasible prior to major surgery and in the
hospital, that a combined cognitive and physical rehabilitation program after discharge can reduce ADRD, and
that a computerized cognitive rehabilitation program can improve multiple cognitive domains in ICU survivors.
Further, exercise enhances endothelial and BBB function, reduces cerebral atrophy, and increases functional
connectivity, providing potential mechanistic basis for these improvements. Thus, a comprehensive mind and
body training program prior to (prehabilitation), during, and after (rehabilitation) hospitalization may be most
effective in reducing ADRD and disability after major surgery but has yet to be evaluated. The main
hypothesis of the COgnitive and Physical Exercise to improve Outcomes after Surgery (COPE-iOS)
study is that a program of cognitive and physical training throughout the perioperative period will
improve long-term cognitive and disability outcomes in older surgical patients at high risk for decline.
We will randomize 250 patients ≥60 years old undergoing elective major non-cardiac surgery with expected
hospitalization >3 days to a comprehensive training program or to active control prior to surgery, during the
surgical hospitalization, and after discharge. We will assess global cognition (Aim 1), disability (Aim 2), and
plasma biomarkers and neuroimaging (Aim 3) at baseline and up to 12 months after discharge."

Our interdisciplinary research team will develop algorithms to accelerate the detection of respiratory virus
outbreaks at an unprecedented local scale in US cities. We propose to advance outbreak detection by
combining machine learning data integration methods and spatial models of disease transmission. The
dynamic models that will be developed will provide mechanistic engines for distinguishing typical from
atypical disease trends and the optimization methods evaluate the informativeness of data sources to
achieve specified public health goals through the rapid evaluation of diverse input data sources. Working
with local healthcare and public health leaders, we will translate the algorithms into user-friendly online tools
to support preparedness plans and decision-making.
Our proposed research is organized around three major aims. In Aim 1, we will apply machine learning and
signal processing methods to build systems that track the earliest indicators of emerging outbreaks within
seven US cities. We will evaluate non-clinical data reflecting early and mild symptoms as well as clinical data
covering underserved communities and geographic and demographic hotspots for viral emergence. In Aim
2, we will develop sub-city scale models reflecting the syndemics of co-circulating respiratory viruses and
chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) that can exacerbate viral infections. We will infer viral transmission rates
and socio-environmental risk cofactors by fitting the model to respiratory disease data extracted from
millions of electronic health records (EHRs) for the last nine years. We will then partner with clinical and
EHR experts to translate our models into the first outbreak detection system for severe respiratory viruses
that incorporates EHR data on CRDs. Using machine learning techniques, we will further integrate other
surveillance, environmental, behavioral and internet predictor data sources to maximize the accuracy,
sensitivity, speed and population coverage of our algorithms. In Aim 3, we will develop an open-access
Python toolkit to facilitate the integration of next generation data into outbreak surveillance models.
This project will produce practical early warning algorithms for detecting emerging viral threats at high
spatiotemporal resolution in several US cities, elucidate socio-geographic gaps in current surveillance
systems and hotspots for viral emergence, and provide a robust design framework for extrapolating these
algorithms to other US cities."

Structural racism and discrimination (SRD) are complex and drive racial inequities. SRD has sustained racial
health disparities in the United States, driven disproportionate incarceration risk among Black men, and
systematically restricted minority populations from health, wealth, and prosperity. As a result, diminished
income earning ability for generations of Black people has led to economic devastation and poor health.
Importantly, older and aging Black men continue to earn less than their White counterparts and the income gap
is continuing to widen. Even when accounting for education, research has shown that the rising wage gap is
attributable to workforce experience and opportunity, hiring and wage discrimination, and incarceration.
Difficulty attaining prevailing wages among older Black men affects family stability, the ability for communities
to thrive, and population health. Geography, place, and proximity to capital and markets are underlying drivers
of health behavior and healthcare access. As a result, older and aging Black men in particular have
demonstrated one of the strongest epidemiologic relationships between low socioeconomic status, residence
in communities with endemic poverty, and chronic disease. The proposed Stage 3 efficacy study aims to test a
novel intervention that directly reduces the racial income gap by providing a universal basic income (UBI). UBI
is intended to promote and protect Black men's health through the influx of capital and subsequent increases in
personal agency and social connections. We hypothesize that providing UBI of $500 per month for six months
will result in increased healthcare utilization among chronically-ill, older and aging, low-income Black men.
Secondarily, we hypothesize that the effect of UBI will depend on whether an individual has a recent history of
incarceration, such that no incarceration history combined with UBI will demonstrate the best study outcomes.
Empirical research examining UBI among older Black men and its capacity to overturn SRD are lacking in the
extant literature. Much of the health disparities research intended to inform health and economic policy
originated from limited perspectives of older and aging Black men. Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois said in The Souls of
Black Folk that for Black people, “discouragement is an unwritten word”. This study draws on that inspiration as
it ultimately seeks to fundamentally overturn the economic oppression and brutality that has defined the Black
experience for generations."

10774319,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods have been broadly applied to clinical problems, from recognition
of clinical findings in physician notes to identification of transcribed speech samples indicating changes in
cognitive status. Deep transformer networks (DTNs) have dramatically advanced NLP accuracy. These deep
learning models have multiple hidden layers that may correspond to billions of trainable parameters, allowing
them to apply information learned from training on large unlabeled corpora to a specific task of interest. However,
their size leaves them especially vulnerable to confounding bias, induced by variables that can influence both
the predictor (text) and the outcome (e.g. an associated diagnosis) of a predictive model. Such systematic biases
are a recognized danger in the application of artificial intelligence methods to clinical problems, and are the focus
of NLM NOT-LM-19-003 which invites applications proposing methods to identify and address them. Deep
learning models in general require large amounts of training data, spurring initiatives to aggregate medical data
from across institutional siloes. This can increase data set size and enhance model portability, but leaves the
resulting models vulnerable to confounding by provenance, where models learn to recognize the origin of dataset
components and make biased predictions based on site-specific class distributions (e.g. COVID prevalence).
Such models will assign classes based on indicators of dataset provenance, rather than diagnostically
meaningful linguistic differences, and make erroneous predictions when the provenance-specific distributions at
the point of deployment differ from those in the training set. Confounding of this nature is a pervasive problem
that presents a fundamental barrier to the portability of trained models, and threatens the utility of datasets
assembled from across institutions and services. Unlike traditional statistical and machine learning models, with
deep transformer networks feature representations are distributed across parameters spread throughout the
entire network. New methods are needed to meet the challenge of identifying and mitigating the influence of
confounding variables in such models. In the proposed research we will develop a systematic approach to
Deconfounding Deep Transformer Networks (DeconDTN), embodied in an eponymous and publicly available
set of open source tools for (1) identification of provenance-related biases, (2) mitigation of these biases using
a novel set of validated methods, and (3) systematic evaluation of the resulting effects on model performance.
While DeconDTN will be generally applicable, development and evaluation will occur in the context of three use
cases involving data sets drawn from different sources: classification of speech transcripts from participants with
dementia drawn from two locations, identification of goals-of-care discussions in clinical notes drawn from
multiple studies involving a range of clinical services, and prediction of COVID-19 status in notes drawn from
different clinical units. Our driving hypothesis is that the resulting models will make more accurate predictions in
these heterogenous datasets than corresponding models without correction for confounding by provenance."

Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a highly prevalent public health problem for which there are few
effective treatments. Sleep disturbances are highly comorbid with AUD and contribute
significantly to disorder progression. Moreover, sleep disturbances can be more difficult to treat
in individuals with AUD. Thus a critical need is to understand the mechanisms by which alcohol
regulates sleep behavior. Alcohol is well known to reduce sleep latency, however this is
followed by increased sleep fragmentation and problems with insomnia in individuals with AUD.
Alcohol is well known to have sedative properties, and subsequent insomnia-related AUD
symptoms have been proposed to be due to tolerance related disruptions in sleep-related
setpoints. Recently, we uncovered a novel pathway by which norepinephrine engages wake-
active dopamine neurons in the ventral periaqueductal gray (vPAG) to produce arousal. We find
in preliminary data that ethanol engages the activation of this pathway, providing a novel
potential mechanism through which alcohol can paradoxically drive wake behavior. Thus in the
project we propose to explore the mechanisms through which acute and chronic ethanol
exposure regulate this vPAG signaling pathway, and to explore the participation of this pathway
in acute and chronic alcohol-dependent alterations in sleep-related behaviors."

The proposal outlines a plan to organize a series of workshops on cognitively-controlled listening
devices. The meetings aim to advance scientific inquiry and computational tools for decoding brain
activity and assessing cognitive functions in order to control assistive listening devices used in everyday
environments. The field pushes forth current limitations in technologies such as hearing aids which take
a bottom-up, hearing-centric approach. Instead, we explore scientific and engineering solutions to
leverage both hearing and cognitive functions to deliver improved communication capabilities. The
format of these workshops is aimed as a hands-on structure where interdisciplinary teams including
senior researchers and younger trainees and students work together during 4 days to pilot new ideas,
exchange approaches and compare methodologies around themes relevant to auditory cognition. The
workshops, to be held every 18 months, aim to foster a nascent community of researchers spanning
hearing scientists, cognitive and brain scientists, engineers and computer scientists. Benefits from the
cross-training and large-scale collaborations throughout these fields will facilitate translating readouts
of the mental state of listeners into effective feedback mechanisms to control hearing prosthetics and
shape the listening experience. The workshop aims to engage a wider community and particularly
cultivate participation of women and under-represented minorities as well as giving a voice to junior
researchers. Beyond the scientific and engineering scholarly contributions, the proposed workshops will
provide know-how to develop systems able to implement cognitive-aware listening devices and as such
can expand the industry of cognitive robotics and assistive devices. A close partnership between the
research community and industry present valuable opportunities for translational impact that benefit the

10773776,"SUMMARY
Urinary oxalate excretion is a key risk factor in the formation of calcium oxalate kidney stones, the most common
type of kidney stone, a disease that affects 9% of the US population. Therapeutic development for prevention of
calcium oxalate kidney stone disease is hampered by our incomplete understanding of the factors leading to the
increased urinary oxalate pool in many patients with calcium oxalate kidney stones. Environmental and lifestyle
factors as well as dietary and metabolic, or endogenous, factors may all play a role, but the interplay between
them has clouded the interpretation of the oxalate focused studies that have been done in kidney stone formers.
Our preliminary data and published studies suggest there is both an increased synthesis of oxalate and a greater
gastrointestinal absorption of oxalate in calcium oxalate kidney stone formers. These warrant confirmation and
the underlying mechanisms need to be defined. The frequency of colonization with Oxalobacter formigenes, a
gut commensal oxalate degrading bacterium, is substantially lower in calcium oxalate kidney stone formers and
its absence has been linked with increased kidney stone risk. Colonization with Oxalobacter formigenes leads
to reduced urinary oxalate excretion in healthy volunteers. Whether colonization with this organism is possible
in calcium oxalate kidney stone formers and leads to reduced urinary oxalate excretion warrants study. Our
hypothesis is that increased endogenous oxalate synthesis and increased gastrointestinal absorption of oxalate
via greater transport capacity and higher bioavailablity due to decreased microbial oxalate degradation in the gut
lead to a greater influx of oxalate and increased urinary oxalate excretion. This proposal aims to 1/ demonstrate
that endogenous oxalate synthesis is increased in idiopathic calcium oxalate kidney stone formers using
13C-isotope oxalate infusion to quantify oxalate production and determine the contribution of different oxalate
precursors by oral dosing with 13C-glycolate and 13C-ascorbic acid; 2/ confirm that gastrointestinal oxalate
absorption is higher in idiopathic calcium oxalate kidney stone formers and define the driving
mechanisms by using a combination of low and high oxalate diets and 13C-oxalate oral dosing coupled with
sugar functional intestinal permeability tests that will identify gut segments and type of transport involved; 3/
demonstrate that the colonization of Oxalobacter formigenes in idiopathic calcium oxalate kidney stone
formers is possible, sustainable, and results in a reduction of urinary oxalate excretion. We expect this
proposal to identify mechanisms playing a role in the increased urinary oxalate pool in idiopathic calcium oxalate
kidney stones patients; develop tools to investigate these mechanisms; provide a potential treatment for lowering
urinary oxalate excretion by colonization with Oxalobacter formigenes. This in turn may lead to the development
of targeted therapies to be tested in clinical trials for treating those afflicted with calcium oxalate kidney stones."
10819223,"In the United States, 400,000 infants are born preterm each year resulting in an infant mortality rate that is worse than 26 other economically developed countries in the world. Preterm birth (PTB) risk is not evenly distributed throughout American society, resulting in massive racial disparities with black women having 50% higher risk than white women. It is widely accepted that genetic variation does not explain racial differences in PTB risk, hence other biological factors must have some obligatory role for disparities in PTB. Extensive work from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) has provided key information for women’s reproductive health, and specifically has characterized the composition of the microbial communities that occupy the cervicovaginal (CV) space. Comprehensive studies in non-pregnant women have led to the classification of CV microbial communities into community state types (CSTs). Subsequent research has demonstrated that select CSTs are associated with various pathologies such as sexually transmitted
infections, bacterial vaginosis, and urinary tract infections. Yet, the data on the association of these CSTs with spontaneous PTB (sPTB) has been limited with existing studies confounded by small sample sizes, lack of racial diversity and inconsistent phenotyping. With funding for the parent RO1, we recently published the results of our racially and ethnically diverse 2000 women cohort. This study provides conclusive data that CSTs and specific bacterial taxa are strongly associated with sPTB. Furthermore, we found that local CV immune responses modify the risk of sPTB associated with high-risk CSTs, suggesting that CV microbial-immune profiles are of critical importance for sPTB risk. Providing possible insight into the known racial disparity with sPTB, our data demonstrate that black women are more likely to be colonized with a high-risk CSTs and have differential expression of CV immune mediators that modify the risk of sPTB. While our findings suggest an opportunity for therapeutic interventions to reduce sPTB, recent advances suggest that only by understanding the totality of an ecosystem and the subsequent host response can we have the greatest impact on health and disease. In this proposal, we are uniquely positioned to advance this field with rigor by deciphering the role of the CV microbiota in a large cohort of well-phenotyped sPTB. We are also poised to address disparities by focusing additional studies on black women. These studies will reveal innovative biological mechanisms in sPTB including 1) whether select CSTs are associated with molecular evidence of premature cervical remodeling and 2) whether high-risk CV microbial-immune profiles are present prior to pregnancy and/or does pregnancy shift women to a favorable or unfavorable state. Addressing these gaps in knowledge will provide novel information as to potential new windows for intervention as well as identifying potential modifiers associated with a high-risk CV microbial-immune state which could lead to a reduction of sPTB in black women."
10765310,"The overall goal of our research is to gain a greater understanding of the dynamics of
SNARE assembly underlying Ca2+-triggered synaptic vesicle fusion and the driving forces
for directional lipid transport mediated by bridge lipid transfer proteins (LTPs). The
synaptic fusion machinery contains three SNARE proteins (syntaxin-1, SNAP-25, and
VAMP2), Munc18-1, and at least five regulatory proteins (Munc13-1, synaptotagmin-1
(Syt1), complexin, -SNAP, and NSF). The SNAREs couple their ordered folding and
assembly to membrane fusion like a molecular zipper, thereby generating force to bring
the synaptic and plasma membranes into close proximity to induce fusion. Other proteins
chaperone the initial SNARE assembly and then clamp it to form a primed partially
zippered SNARE complex. Ca2+ triggers its further zippering to conclude membrane
fusion. However, the composition and structure of this primed SNARE complex remain
unclear. In the previous funding cycle, we discovered and characterized a tetrameric
complex formed by Munc18-1, Syntaxin-1, VAMP2, and Munc13-1 in solution. Here, we
propose to reconstitute the entire primed complex, which additionally contains complexin
and the Ca2+ sensor Sty1, and characterize its stability, structure, and dynamics in a
membrane environment. As a newly identified category of LTPs in eukaryotes, bridge
LTPs are thought to act as a conduit to enable lipids to flow from one membrane to the
other at their contact site. The bulk lipid flow causes membrane expansion of certain
target membranes, leading to organelle biogenesis. However, the forces that dictate the
direction and rate of the lipid flow are unknown. We propose that gradients of membrane
tension and membrane protein densities can serve as the long-thought driving forces,
which will be tested in our novel lipid transfer assays. SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion
and LTP-mediate lipid transfer are two complementary membrane trafficking pathways,
whose malfunction has been linked to numerous diseases. A better understanding of their
mechanisms has the potential to enable intervention in these diseases."

 Efficient access to molecules of importance to human health has long driven the development of innovative
synthetic methods. In recent years, greater emphasis has been placed on exploring stereochemically complex
molecular space with high Fsp3 that is not well-represented in typical compound screening libraries. In this
context, N-heterocycles and aminated carbocycles are attractive targets, as they are widely prevalent in drugs,
natural products, biomolecules and ligands. We are developing two modular platforms capable of rapid, flexible
transformations of simple precursors (alkenes, dienes, allenes, imines) into azetidines, pyrrolidines, piperidines
and other N-heterocycles and amine-bearing carbocycles. Mechanistic insights are used to tune the fate of
underexplored reactive intermediates that include methyleneaziridines, aziridinium ylides and 2-amidoallyl
cations. The first platform leverages our expertise in catalyst-controlled nitrene/carbene transfers to furnish
aziridinium ylides that are shuttled along diverse paths to deliver stereochemically rich amines and
enantioenriched N-heterocycles. A second platform explores mild ways to generate 2-amidoallyl cations from
allenes and engage these reactive species in enantioselective cycloadditions for rapid syntheses of densely
functionalized carbo- and heterocycle synthetic building blocks.
 In addition to the continued development of synthetic methods to furnish molecules with high Fsp3 linked to
higher success in drug screening libraries, the biological testing of chemical space unlocked by our work is
important to its long-term significance. Several compounds from our libraries show a range of anti-cancer, anti-
TB, antimalarial and other activities, but preparing individual compounds is time-consuming and labor-intensive,
limiting the impact and significance of our work. We are adapting our synthetic methods to the synthesis of DNA-
encoded libraries that will be made available to screening facilities at UW-Madison and more broadly to the
academic and industry communities. Last, our innovative methods for amine synthesis will be applied to natural
product analogs of the anti-malarial compound jogyamycin and the anticancer antibiotic nogalamycin to
understand structure-activity relationships, with a long-term goal of uncovering new small molecule binders of
the ribosome. Jogyamycin and nogalamycin are challenging targets for total synthesis, as molecules that bind
the ribosome often do not follow the Lipinski ‘rule of 5’ due to the highly electronegative surface potential and
limited buried surface area differ from proteins and often contain several contiguous stereocenters bearing polar
hydroxyl and amine groups that are tedious to prepare using current synthetic methods, but are readily
accessible using our synthetic methodologies."

End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is among the top contributors to mortality in the US population. Nearly 40%
of ESKD is caused by diabetes, with a natural history that includes three transitional stages: 1.) Development
of diabetes; 2.) Initiation of diabetic kidney disease (DKD); and 3.) Progression of DKD to end-stage disease.
Despite the public health burden posed by ESKD, interventions to preserve kidney function in patients with
diabetes are limited. Black and Hispanic groups face higher burdens of diabetes and more rapid progression to
ESKD than White, non-Hispanic groups. Social determinants of health (SDOH) and other environmental
exposures (e.g., metals) are important contributors to these disparities. However, the mechanisms linking
environmental exposures to DKD are unclear. Research to integrate environmental data into the multi-omics
framework is needed, particularly in Black and Hispanic communities, who suffer from excessive ESKD and
are burdened by life-long, adverse environmental exposures. Our goal is to establish a diabetes and kidney
disease study site (DSS) comprised of 300 racially and ethnically diverse adults, including 200 with
diabetes (half of whom also have kidney disease) and 100 healthy controls. Our DSS will be part of a
collaborative initiative to advance the application of multi-omics technologies to study health and disease in
ancestrally diverse populations. We will actively engage with this consortium to develop generalizable study
protocols, ranging from participant recruitment to integrative analytic pipelines that can be shared and
deployed in the cloud. To successfully recruit 300 study participants (Aim 1), we will leverage our established
recruitment infrastructure, utilizing an innovative selection strategy that will enrich our sample for those most
likely to transition across DKD stages. Thirty DKD cases will be dually recruited with the UIC Kidney Precision
Medicine Project (KPMP), enabling linkage to rich KPMP kidney tissue histopathology and multi-omics data in
a subsample of DKD cases. Our sample will reflect the diversity of our health system, which includes a patient
population that is predominantly non-White (~80%). We will further leverage our extensive clinical research
experience to collect biospecimens and obtain detailed information on environmental exposures, outcomes,
and other covariables annually for three years (Aim 2). Collected blood specimens will be used to carry-out
genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiling among all study participants (Aim
3). Utilizing pipelines and integrative analytic protocols developed in collaboration with the consortium, we will
identify molecular profiles linked to environmental exposures and kidney histopathology and examine their
associations with each stage of the DKD course (Aim 4). We expect our DSS to have important research
impacts, contributing critical information towards the general advancement of integrative systems biology
research methods and elucidating novel biological mechanisms and biomarkers for DKD."
10890170,"Neuronal aggregation of the protein alpha-synuclein (αS) in Lewy bodies is a hallmark of key
Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders (ADRDs) including Lewy Body Dementia (LBD),
Parkinson’s disease with dementia (PDD) and mixed AD/LB dementia. Collectively these
disorders affect millions of US citizens. Understanding mechanisms of αS toxicity thus holds key
import for understanding and treating ADRD. αS reversibly associates with cellular membranes
in neurons and this interaction is clearly important for toxicity, but the underlying mechanisms
remain unclear. Moreover, αS is also highly abundant in the cytosol. What αS is doing in different
cellular compartments and how this may be relevant to neurotoxicity when αS abnormally
accumulates in ADRD remains unknown. Our previous extensive genetic and physical αS
interaction mapping connected αS not only to membrane trafficking proteins but also to a
surprising number of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). However, while RBP dysregulation and loss
of RNA homeostasis are clearly important contributors to neurodegeneration in general, a direct
link between αS and RBPs was elusive until now. We recently found that αS can perturb RNA
homeostasis by directly interacting with and disrupting the mRNA decapping machinery found in
Processing Bodies, membraneless ribonucleoprotein complexes responsible for mRNA turnover.
αS strongly interacts with decapping proteins of P-bodies in neurons. Importantly, the exact same
(N-terminus) αS region is responsible for binding to membranes and to P-body proteins. This sets
up a dichotomous relationship whereby alterations at the membrane can directly affect gene
regulation through redistributing αS between membrane and cytosolic compartments. On the
basis of our findings in human iPSC neurons and postmortem brain, we hypothesize that αS
shuttles between membranes and P-bodies and, upon accumulation to toxic levels, disrupts P-
body composition and mRNA turnover. Model organism and human genetics analyses also
support a causal influence of the P-body pathway in modulating αS toxicity an PD risk. Here, we
will, first, rigorously test these connections by measuring P-body perturbations in a wide-range of
synucleinopathy models, postmortem brain and mouse models and assess the direct impact of
P-body genes on neurotoxicity. Second, we will investigate which specific mRNA transcripts and
subclasses of mRNAs are impacted by αS accumulation or mutation. Finally, we will investigate
how αS modulates decapping enzymology and composition in a fully in vitro reconstituted system.
We anticipate that this study will reveal that RNA homeostasis disruption is a key aspect of Lewy
body disease pathogenesis and motivate new treatment strategies for ADRD."
10745713,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite remarkable short-term outcomes, the rate of late renal allograft loss has not improved. This is
increasingly attributed to the cumulative effects of ongoing subtle immunological injury that often remains
undetected. Clinical parameters and even surveillance biopsies have limited predictive value, underscoring the
need for new predictive biomarkers. Dr. Cherukuri showed that: (i) Human Breg activity is best characterized by
the ratio of IL-10/TNFα expression by immature T1 transitional B cells (T1Bs); and (ii) This T1B IL-10/TNFα ratio
3 mos post-transplant, predicts subsequent acute rejection (AR), allograft fibrosis, decreased eGFR and graft
survival. Furthermore, assessment of T1B IL-10/TNFα ratio prior to transplantation showed that in ~75% of
patients, the cytokine ratio remains stable after transplantation and predicts their risk for AR and subsequent
outcomes (pre-determined). In contrast, in ~25% of patients, the cytokine ratio shifts from high to low or from low
to high, and their risk for subsequent outcomes tracks with the direction of the shift. The mechanisms that
regulate stable vs. switchable T1B cytokine expression are unknown. Understanding such mechanisms will allow
us to accurately risk-stratify patients prior to transplantation and elucidate key regulatory mechanisms that
contribute to an individual patient’s underlying immunological reactivity. We hypothesize that transcriptional
regulation by genetic or epigenetic mechanisms dictate the stability of the T1B cytokine ratio, Breg activity, and
determine a patient’s post-transplant clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by examining the genetic and
epigenetic underpinnings of stable vs. switchable T1B cytokine expression, and by determining whether clinical
characteristics correlate with these changes. These Aims will allow Dr. Cherukuri to gain expertise in: (i) state of
the art advanced genomic and epigenetic analysis approaches (e.g., ATACseq, bisulfite sequencing, RNAseq),

10745714,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 A major challenge with systemic administration of silica nanoparticles (SNPs) is clearance by and
accumulation in organs of mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), and subsequent immune response. Poor
loading capacity of SNPs, their stability and vacuolization in macrophages, and potentially lower metabolism and
clearance rates in patient populations may necessitate administration of high and frequent doses of SNPs which
could lead to MPS saturation and overload. Detailed investigation of immunotoxicity of SNPs in the MPS is
needed to establish their safety profile to choose drug carriers with well-defined immunological properties. The
influence of SNPs on the fate and function of phagocytes after uptake and saturation, and on host immune
response need further elucidation. The correlation between the physicochemical properties of SNPs and the
mechanisms of sex-dependent toxicity is unclear. Also, the immune response alteration upon i.v. administration
of SNPs and the mechanisms behind this response are largely unknown. To address these knowledge gaps in
this grant application the following Specific Aims are proposed:
 1) To investigate the influence of saturation of macrophages with SNPs on their phagocytic activity,
survival, proliferation, and immune signaling as a function of nanoparticle physicochemical properties. The
underlying hypothesis to be tested in this aim is that saturation of macrophages by SNPs will influence their
normal function, molecular signaling, and fate based on nanoparticle characteristics.
 2) To investigate bone marrow toxicity and function of tissue-resident macrophages after i.v.
administration of SNPs, and assess the number and activation status of circulating phagocytes after in vitro
exposure to SNPs. The underlying hypothesis to be tested in this aim is that size, geometry, and porosity of
SNPs influence the normal function of bone marrow, tissue-resident macrophages, and peripheral blood
phagocytes, a phenomenon which may be reversible and depend on dose and frequency of administration.
 3) To investigate the immune side effects and anti-PEG response of systemically administered SNPs as
a function of animal sex and particle physicochemical properties. The underlying hypotheses are: i) Anti-PEG
IgM and IgG will be generated in a time-dependent manner upon exposure to PEGylated SNPs; ii) variation in
immune response in female vs male Th1 and Th2 bias animal models will contribute to SNP toxicity and immune-
mediated side effects.
 This proposal is significant because understanding key physicochemical properties of SNPs with well-
defined immunological properties will help establish safer platforms for intravenous drug delivery. It is innovative
because for the first time it approaches different SNP interactions with various components of the immune system
as a result of animal-sex and different immune-biased in a systematic fashion."
10745715,"Project Summary/Abstract
Of the 150,000 patients annually undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, 35% develop
complications that increase mortality 5-fold and expenditures by 50%. Differences in patient risk and operative
approach explain only 2% of hospital variation in some complications. The intraoperative phase remains
understudied as a source of variation, despite its complexity and amenability to improvement.
Unfortunately, little is known about the multitude of factors impacting optimal cardiac surgical outcomes. Within
non-cardiac surgery, peer rater assessments of a surgeon’s technical skills (e.g., instrument handling) are
correlated with complications. Beyond technical skills, the cardiac surgical team uniquely relies on carefully
orchestrated non-technical practices (e.g., teamwork, communication, situational awareness, leadership) to
deliver care, including ensuring the patient’s hemodynamic stability across phase transitions involving
extracorporeal cardiopulmonary bypass. Most research to date has focused on technical skills and non-
technical practices in simulated environments with subjective human raters, thus lacking the medical and
psychological fidelity of real-world surgery required to identify relevant improvement targets. High-dimensional
computer-based assessments of video recordings, including capabilities for recognizing and tracking human
activity (video understanding), may offer unparalleled capabilities for providing an objective, non-simulation-
based platform for assessing technical skills and non-technical practices of surgical outcomes.
Our long-term goal is to reduce surgical complications by identifying and promoting adoption of evidence-
based surgical practices. The objectives of this proposal are to: (i) investigate the relationship between peer
rater assessments of intraoperative technical skills and non-technical practices with risk-adjusted complication
rates and (ii) to evaluate the feasibility of automating computer-based assessments to identify important
intraoperative technical skills and non-technical practices. This multi-center study leverages two mature
physician collaboratives providing detailed intraoperative data merged with The Society of Thoracic Surgeons
outcomes data. We have the following aims: (1) To investigate the relationship between peer rater
assessments of surgeon technical skills and variability in risk-adjusted patient complications; (2) To investigate
the relationship between peer rater assessments of intraoperative team-based non-technical practices and
variability in risk-adjusted patient complications; (3) To explore the feasibility of using objective, data-driven
computer-based assessments to automate the identification and tracking of significant, intraoperative
determinants of risk-adjusted patient complications. This study, which aligns with NHLBI’s priorities by
leveraging a multidisciplinary team to identify modifiable determinants of surgical performance, is expected to
positively impact care by using a platform to broadly evaluate surgical outcomes."
10880593,"Accumulating reports indicate that substance use disorders (SUDs) and overdoses result in hearing loss (HL) and vestibular loss (VL). This is problematic because hearing and balance are important for communication, employment, mental health, physical independence, and overall quality of life. HL and VL would have a greater negative impact on people with SUDs, as this population already struggles with a higher incidence of mental health issues, unemployment, and poorer quality of life. People of minority status with HL/VL are further marginalized because of socioeconomic and/or cultural barriers to audiological healthcare. Unfortunately, the literature on substance-misuse-related HL is sporadic and primarily consists of case reports describing various degrees of either temporary or permanent HL from illicit drugs or prescribed opioid misuse. Even less is known about the effects of SUDs on the vestibular system. A few studies indicate alcohol misuse impairs balance, and opioids and alcohol disrupt peripheral and central vestibular function. The existing studies suggest differential effects on the inner ear based on substance type and use patterns. There is a critical lack of rigorous research using objective measures to identify the peripheral and central effects of SUDs on hearing and vestibular function. Likewise, the influence of health comorbidity, demographics, socioeconomic position, and substance-use patterns on HL/VL in the SUD population has not been investigated. Our project goals are to improve our knowledge of the impact of SUDs on hearing and vestibular function and to identify who is most at risk for HL/VL. To accomplish these goals, we will be the first to investigate peripheral and central hearing (Aim 1) and vestibular (Aim 2) function in a large cohort of diverse people who have SUDs, recruited across three regionally unique study sites. Data will be compared to an age-sex-race or ethnicity-matched control group without SUDs. Last, we will determine the predictive health, demographic, socioeconomic, and substance-use factors that increase the risk of developing HL/VL secondary to substance misuse (Aim 3). We hypothesize that chronic substance misuse will affect the auditory and/or vestibular systems like mechanisms underlying oto- vestibulotoxic medications. Based on the literature, we hypothesize that more health comorbidities, older age, being of non-Hispanic White background, lower socioeconomic position, and riskier substance-use patterns will predict the severity of HL or VL. Biological sex differences are unclear in the existing HL/VL literature; however, our results will help elucidate sex differences in HL/VL and SUDs. SUDs and overdoses have significantly increased since the coronavirus pandemic and disproportionately so among minority populations. Thus, this work is timely and important because early HL/VL intervention is key to minimizing health and social burdens, but care is impeded in SUD and minority populations. Our findings will enhance awareness among professionals who serve people with SUDs so they can make appropriate diagnoses and recommendations. The results will inform our future work to develop accessible, equitable interventions for people with SUDs and health disparities."
10757671,"Apical constriction is a change in cell shape that drives critical morphogenetic events, including gastrulation
and branching morphogenesis in diverse animals and neural tube formation in vertebrates. Although apical
constriction was recognized more than a century ago, fundamental questions about mechanisms of apical
constriction remain unanswered. Research in this laboratory focuses on understanding how cells accomplish
this fundamental change in shape. Apical constriction is being studied to uncover insights into how animals are
shaped, and to contribute to a foundation of basic science leading to improved diagnosis and prevention of
neural tube defects. This proposal will support a series of projects to answer how the molecules that contribute
to apical constriction generate and transmit the forces that change cell shapes, what triggers changes in cell
shape, how developmental patterning mechanisms deploy cell biological players with the necessary spatial
and temporal precision, and to identify and understand novel mechanisms that make important contributions to
apical constriction. The laboratory has developed several key technical innovations to address critical barriers
to progress in this field, and the proposed projects build on the lab's strength in dissecting cell biological
mechanisms of development more generally. Study of apical constriction intersects with some of the major
themes in cell and developmental biology including cell polarization, control of motor activity, and dynamic
control of forces, in a complex in vivo context. The proposed projects seek to combine in a single model
system the tools that are valuable to different model systems, plus the new tools that the lab has developed, to
produce unique and sustained contributions to unraveling mechanisms that are relevant to critical
morphogenetic events."

large and complicated systems comprised of multiple computers, signal processors, neural recording

collect neural data over long periods of time during unstructured and varied tasks, enabling quantification of
context-dependent neural variability due to subject-state (e.g., fatigue, pain, or stress) as well as plasticity due
to learning. Understanding how neural signals vary over time will be critical for clinical BCI systems that must be
robust, generalizable, and autonomous (i.e., operate for extended periods without technician intervention).
This project will first quantify the impact of subject-state on movement-related neural activity and performance
during in-home BCI use. This understanding is critical to developing robust BCIs that eliminate the need for
recalibration even in uncontrolled environments. The extent to which subject-state information is represented in
motor cortex and overlaps with BCI control dimensions will inform development efforts to mitigate the impact of
these nuisance variables. Participants will use the BCI for a variety of self-selected computer access tasks over
periods of many months that will challenge decoder performance. This project will investigate motor learning
mechanisms that may be engaged to facilitate improvements in performance that generalize to many different
tasks. Experiments will test the hypothesis that stable population-level neural activity emerges to strengthen
movement-related activity while minimizing non-task-related neural variability. Finally, participants will undergo
targeted neural training to determine if motor learning can be accelerated and whether different mechanisms of
neural reorganization are engaged in response to interventions that challenge the speed and accuracy properties
of the decoder in different ways. This project will improve our understanding of neural plasticity mechanisms
during extended BCI use in a real-world environment. Ultimately this knowledge will enable stable, high-

10757676,"Project summary:
This project will be an observational study with the primary goal to examine the consequences of non-pulsatile
flow under continuous flow left ventricular assisted devices (CF-LVAD) on the cerebral circulation. The public
health burden from congestive heart failure (CHF) is substantial and few treatment options are available to those
patients at the end-stage. Unfortunately, cardiac transplantation is not widely available and many of these
patients rely on left ventricular assist devices for circulatory support. The newest generation devices are
designed for durability and therefore deliver non-pulsatile flow. Despite improvements in CHF mortality, CF-
LVAD is associated with multiple complications that are hypothesized to originate from the impact of non-pulsatile
flow on arterial endothelium, notably gastrointestinal bleeding, and poor gains in exercise tolerance. CF-LVAD
patients develop unusually high rates of ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation (ISHT), one of the
leading causes of death in these patients. ISHT in the general population results from microcirculatory
dysfunction with disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and cerebral endothelium. The impact of non-pulsatile
flow on the BBB and cerebral endothelium has not yet been studied in human CF-LVAD patients, in part due to
the lack of markers specific to the cerebral circulation. In aim 1a we will perform transcranial Doppler (TCD)
before and after CF-LVAD implantation to measure the breath holding index as a physiological marker of cerebral
autoregulation an important function of cerebral endothelium. In aim 1b we will examine the impact of non-
pulsatile flow on the blood retina barrier (anatomically similar to the BBB) with optical coherence tomography
angiography and retinal doppler. In aim 2 we will examine changes in cognition in CF-LVAD participants before
and after surgery and versus controls. The overall goals of this proposal will be to identify physiological and
functional changes which occur in the cerebral circulation under non-pulsatile flow which will allow for improved
risk stratification and tailored treatment approaches in the application of CF-LVAD in end-stage CHF."
10757682,"Alum is the most widely used adjuvant in current subunit vaccines against infectious agents. Mucosal tissues
represent the main portal of entry of pathogens. In contrast with the general bloodstream in the systemic
compartment, mucosal tissues contain a large number of IgA producing cells. This immunoglobulin isotype
contributes to the protection of exposed mucosal surfaces via a number of mechanisms including prevention of
pathogen binding to host cells (epithelial cells and dendritic cells), neutralization of toxins in the lumen, and
neutralization of viruses within epithelial cells. Injected vaccines can induce high levels of IgG responses in the
bloodstream, but they are not effective at inducing secretory IgA responses which are needed for optimal
protection of mucosal surfaces. In contrast with injected vaccines, mucosal vaccines delivered through the oral,
rectal, nasal or sublingual routes target Mucosal-Associated Lymphoid Tissues where they can induce innate
signals necessary for induction of secretory IgA responses. Despite decades of research on mucosal vaccines,
to date, only two oral vaccines and one intranasal vaccine are licensed for use in the US. This proposal will
address the overall hypothesis that the adjuvant alum triggers innate signals that restrict the breath of antibody
responses and prevent the production of IgA. Our newly generated data suggest that a family of molecules
produced by myeloid cells plays a central role in preventing IgA production by alum-based injected vaccines and
targeting those molecules will improve protection by increasing IgA production. Aim 1 will focus on the
mechanisms underlying innate suppression of IgA responses by myeloid cells in non-mucosal sites. Aim 2 will
identify the cells and signaling pathways targeted by pharmacological agents inhibiting this family of molecules
to regulate induction of systemic and mucosal immune responses after systemic immunization. Aim 3 will
establish whether strategies targeting the innate suppressors of IgA responses promote broad systemic and
mucosal immunity and can protect a relevant animal model against infection with an enteric virus."

Summary
 The overall objectives of the Data Management Core are (1) to support all aspects of data collection,
verification, consolidation, and documentation for the CLDRC, (2) to facilitate cutting-edge analyses by all
CLDRC investigators by providing support for investigators with less experience with specific statistical
methods, and (3) to enable CLDRC investigators and other researchers in the field to take advantage of the
datasets generated by the CLDRC for innovative analyses of specific learning disabilities (SLDs) and related
difficulties such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and academic anxiety.
 The collaborative structure of the CLDRC provides a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary cross-project
analyses of data from both community and clinic samples, single individuals and familial relationships such as
twin pairs and siblings, cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, neuropsychological and neuroimaging
measures, and molecular genetic data from our own samples and from the large publicly-available databases
of genotypic and phenotypic information generated by the rapidly expanding literature of genome-wide
association studies (GWAS). The Core will coordinate data sharing procedures to ensure that summary data
generated by the Center will be made available to qualified investigators outside the CLDRC in a timely
manner to maximize the impact of the NICHD investment in the CLDRC. We will especially welcome and
encourage requests to share data from early-stage investigators, investigators who are from groups that are
underrepresented in research careers, and scientists in settings with limited resources."
10931657,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Over the course of this two-year Phase II effort, Liberating Technologies, Inc. (LTI), along with its collaborators
at Fillauer Companies and Hanger Clinic, will refine, expand, and test a bimodal walking-running foot that would
then be poised to become a viable commercial product that can be reimbursed under the existing L-code
reimbursement structure. The goal of this project is to create a single foot that is optimized in each mode and
comparable to a walking foot when in a walking mode and a running foot when in running mode. This novel foot
would provide lower limb amputees who don’t currently have the access to running feet due to the lack of
insurance coverage, the opportunity to participate in running and other running-based activities (e.g. basketball,
etc.) to increase physical fitness. In doing so, the Caesar foot would also allow for the increased social
participation and the physical and mental health benefits that are associated with these activities.
In order to achieve this goal, we will progress and refine the bimodal foot technology with the achievement of the
following objectives: (1) iterate and optimize the design of the bimodal foot to achieve a fully functional prototype
ready for testing, (2) perform verification testing to confirm the prototype meets the design criteria, (3) validate
the prototype in a pilot take-home trial and assess its impact on the physical activity of lower limb amputees, and
(4) start preparing for an FDA submission for the Caesar foot.
The outcomes will be data that verify and validate the bimodal foot device in the laboratory and in the real world.
The product will be a highly advanced, commercially viable, verified, and validated bimodal prosthetic foot. This
innovative design allows us to address both of the identified primary barriers preventing LLAs from taking part in
these activities: 1) inadequately designed prostheses (by providing a foot with optimized design, alignment, and
biomechanics in both walking and running modes) and 2) the lack of accessibility for higher activity prostheses
(the cost of the foot would be covered by insurance)."

I am an Epidemiologist and a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Surgery at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). Through scholarship, I will devote my professional career to improving the
care and outcomes for people with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD). I have graduate training in
Bioengineering (MS, ’03), Medicine, Health and Society (MA, ’10), and Epidemiology (PhD, ’16). While I have
exceptional training in epidemiology methods and have a long background of conducting epidemiologic
research, the majority of my previous work was in a support role and I want to pivot into areas where I lack
training and expertise. The overall goal of this K01 award, therefore, is to provide me with the training and
mentorship in disparities and in intervention research aimed at reducing disparities that are critical to becoming
an independent scientist. To accomplish this overall goal, I have assembled a team of internationally renowned
scholars with expertise in the topics and methods described in my application. My primary mentor is Dr.
Samuel Cykert, an expert in health care-related racial disparities and an R01-funded investigator with
experience in designing and implementing successful interventions to reduce these disparities. My co-mentor
is Dr. Adil Haider, an expert in the role of implicit bias in health care-related racial disparities, and an
investigator with a significant history of R-level funding. Dr. Phillip Goodney will lend his expertise and
credibility as a senior-level, practicing vascular surgeon and as the Chair of the Vascular Quality Initiative
Research Advisory Committee. Each of the three are fully committed to this project and to my success. The
research plan is designed to first identify the presence of racial disparities in the delivery of guideline-
recommended care using the nationally representative vascular quality initiative registry, a database of
vascular procedures performed across 536 locations in the US. Second, I will administer the implicit
association test to vascular surgeons to examine implicit racial bias and determine if those biases are
correlated with actual clinical results. Finally, I will incorporate the findings from these first components of the
research plan into the design of an intervention aimed at reducing disparities in the delivery of PAD-related
health care. I will pilot test the intervention by assessing acceptability and utility among surgeons who care for
patients with symptomatic PAD. I have recommended coursework, workshops, conferences, and other
educational opportunities to round out my training. I have set up five objectives regarding career development
and each of these activities is directly related to one or more of those five objectives. The successful
completion of this project will lead to an R01 submission designed to test a multi-site intervention and allow me
to become an independent investigator who can contribute to health equity in an area where optimal care can
attenuate substantial morbidity and mortality."
10766226,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
 The Geriatric Acute and Post-Acute Fall Prevention Intervention (GAPcare) is a promising emergency 
department (ED) initiated intervention for reducing falls and healthcare visits in older adults; GAPcare reduced 
6-month ED visits for falls by 66%, all-cause ED visits by 53%, and hospitalizations by 43%. Because GAPcare 
begins immediately after a fall occurs, motivation to change behavior is high. However, GAPcare requires in- 
person pharmacists and physical therapists (PTs), which limits scalability to large EDs, which account for only 
43.8% of all ED visits. If we fail to scale this intervention, valuable prevention opportunities will be missed for the 
2.8 Million older adults who seek care for falls in EDs each year. Our over-arching goal is to expand the reach 
of GAPcare by testing a video telehealth GAPcare (e-GAPcare) intervention in a community ED without existing 
pharmacy and PT services. The rationale for this research is that telehealth for specialist evaluations have 
already been successfully implemented in EDs, suggesting that GAPcare could be adapted for patients with falls 
who would benefit from pharmacy and PT consultation, but cannot receive them due to staffing limitations in 
rural or smaller community EDs. Our long-term goal is to prevent falls in older adults and healthcare visits. The 
overall objective of this application is to develop and test a telehealth intervention for falls based on our 
successful GAPcare model. Our central hypothesis is that e-GAPcare will help ED clinicians identify fall risk 
factors, such as gait, balance, and cognitive impairment and could ameliorate these risk factors through action 
plans co-created with patients preventing the next fall. 
 GAPcare’s specific aims are to: (1) conduct semi-structured interviews (n=18-24) with content experts in 
telehealth stratified by practice setting (metro/suburban/rural) to gain insights about the practical considerations; 
(2) refine the GAPcare intervention and study protocol based on feedback from ED staff, patient and caregivers; 
and (3) conduct a single arm feasibility study with older adult ED patients (n=40) with a recent fall to determine 
if they can complete the fall risk assessment and intervention to assess the feasibility and acceptability of e- 
GAPcare. Dr. Goldberg will obtain initial estimates of efficacy for a larger, multi-center GAPcare III trial. Using 
phone calls and the electronic health record we will measure subsequent falls, and healthcare visits at 6 months, 
to inform initial efficacy for our subsequent larger, multi-center GAPcare III trial. 
 Dr. Goldberg’s e-GAPcare overarching aims are to develop and test an ED-based telehealth intervention that 
reduces recurrent falls and healthcare visits and to launch her physician-scientist career at the intersection of 
emergency medicine and geriatrics. To achieve this goal, Dr. Goldberg will work with her mentors Drs. Resnik 
and Ranney to improve her expertise in qualitative research, digital health, longitudinal data analysis, and clinical 
trial methods. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, we will produce a fully piloted, community- 
informed telehealth intervention tailored to the unique health needs of older adults with falls."
10760225,"Abstract
Traumatic brain injury is the most common neurological disorder and 80% consist of mild traumatic brain injury
(mTBI). The severity and persistence of cognitive symptoms is increased with additional repeat mTBIs (rmTBI).
A high frequency head impact (HF-HI) mouse model of rmTBI developed by the Burns lab displays decreased
learning and changes in transcriptomic profiles related to synaptic signaling accompanied by decreased plasticity
and synaptic changes in CA1 pyramidal neurons. This would suggest that synaptic modifications underly the
anterograde cognitive symptoms following rmTBI. It is still unknown how rmTBI directly effects an already
established memory. Engrams, defined as lasting physical or chemical changes in neurons, are the neural
substrate underlying episodic memory. Studies in transgenic rodents use immediate early genes and
pharmacological labeling, can tag engram cells in contextual fear conditioning (CFC) paradigms. Subsequent
optogenetic reactivation of engrams in the hippocampal formation is sufficient to elicit memory recall outside the
conditioned context and reanimate fear memories in models of amnesia. Preliminary data has shown that the
HF-HI model reduces freezing time in CFC probe trials and engram cells expressing Chr2-YFP can be tagged
in transgenic engram mice. I propose to interrogate immunohistological and electrophysiological properties of
engram cells to explore architectural or synaptic modifications in the repeat head impact brain. I will also use
optogenetics in vivo to reanimate amnestic memories. This research will explore how synaptic modification
relates to retrograde cognitive deficits following rmTBI and probe memory recall, not memory substrate loss, as
a mechanism for retrograde amnesia."
10760294,"Project Summary / Abstract
The goal of this project is to identify three proteins of the intrinsic retinal visual cycle that maintain the
sensitivity of cones under daylight conditions. During the previous funding period, the PI found that co-
expression of RGR opsin and retinol dehydrogenase-10 (Rdh10) confers upon cells the capacity to take
up all-trans-retinol (atROL) from the medium and release 11-cis-retinol (11cROL), only on exposure to
visible light. The same atROL to 11cROL conversion activity has been observed by Müller cells,
although not previously reported as light dependent. Cones, but not rods, possess an 11cROL-
dehydrogenase (11cRDH) activity that allows them to utilize the 11cROL released by Müller cells to
make 11cRAL chromophore and thereby regenerate photobleached cone opsins. The long-term goal
of this project is to understand the processes that enable continuous cone vision during
daylight exposure in mammals. Given the importance of cones to human vision, addressing this
deficit in our knowledge is certainly within the NEI mission. Specific Aim 1 is to determine the roles of
RGR opsin and Rdh10 in the intrinsic retinal visual cycle. This will be accomplished in a collaborative
study using biochemical and physiological methodologies. The central hypothesis for Aim 1 is that RGR
opsin and Rdh10 comprise the 11cROL-generator in Müller cells, and that formation of 11cROL by
these proteins is driven by light. Specific Aim 2 is to identify the 11cRDH that allows cones to
regenerate visual pigment from 11cROL. This will be accomplished using a cDNA expression-screen to
test members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family that are expressed in cones.
The expected outcome of this study is the identification of three proteins that together comprise the
intrinsic retinal visual cycle. These results amount to the uncovering of a new metabolic pathway in the
retina. They will greatly extend our knowledge about the regeneration of cone visual pigment in
daylight. Also, they will open the door to further genetic and functional biochemical studies into the
retinal visual cycle, including the potential to identify new susceptibility loci for inherited retinopathies
and maculopathies. Mutations in the human RGR gene have already been associated with retinitis
pigmentosa in a small subset of cases. While it has been long appreciated that invertebrates, such as
insects, use light to regenerate their visual pigments, this has never been shown for vertebrates. The
PI's finding that light drives regeneration of cone visual pigment is therefore a novel and
important discovery."
10760297,"A significant obstacle in current hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy studies has been the ability to
achieve persisting high-level engraftment of gene-modified cells to provide long-term therapeutic efficacy.
Subtherapeutic engraftment occurs even under full myeloablative conditioning and will likely become an even
bigger issue with nonmyeloablative and nongenotoxic conditioning. The only corrective measure for
subtherapeutic correction levels is an allogeneic HSC transplant, which subjects patients to the risks of graft-
versus-host disease. Here we propose an alternative, minimally toxic approach to increase engraftment
of gene-modified cells into the therapeutic range that avoids the significant side-effects associated with
myeloablative conditioning and allogeneic HSC transplantation. Our approach will be applied to sickle cell
disease (SCD) and ß-thalassemia, which represent the most common severe monogenic diseases worldwide.
Gene replacement therapies for these disorders have shown promising early results but also in many cases
subtherapeutic gene-correction levels. In this application, we propose an innovative strategy to enrich genome-
edited and therapeutically relevant HSC post-transplantation in the context of reduced, nonmyeloablative
conditioning. This strategy relies on three coordinated aims that collectively address current HSC gene
therapy/genome editing transplantation. Specific Aim 1 will optimize safety and efficacy of novel base
editors/prime editors to allow simultaneous modification of the therapeutic globin target and of the selection gene.
Specific Aim 2 will apply these novel editing tools to the modification of HSCs derived from both healthy or
sickle cell patients in order to support high levels of therapeutic globin production upon engraftment and drug
selection in the mouse xenograft model. Specific Aim 3 will build upon these findings to evaluate engraftment
and selection protocols for edited HSC in the clinically relevant rhesus macaque autologous transplant model in
the setting of reduced-intensity conditioning. To accomplish these aims, we assembled a multidisciplinary team
which includes investigators with complementary expertise in base editing/prime editing (Dr. Liu),
hemoglobinopathies (Dr. Weiss) and HSC biology and transplantation (Dr. Kiem). Our findings should be
applicable to other diseases in which genetically corrected cells do not have a natural selective advantage and
also to other reduced-intensity, nongenotoxic conditioning regimens. Collectively, the proposed studies will
define a safer and effective HSCs transplantation protocol that will serve as a foundation for clinical testing in
patients suffering from hemoglobinopathies and from other genetic diseases."

Declines in physical function with aging are an enormous clinical and public health problem that lead to increased
disability, institutionalization, health care costs, lower quality of life and premature mortality. The burden of
physical limitations and disability is higher in African compared with Caucasian individuals. Compounding the
issue, older African Ancestry populations represent a rapidly growing segment of the population, especially
outside the USA. For example, the number of individuals aged ≥60 in the Caribbean is expected to increase from
59 to 196 million by 2050. Black immigrants from the Caribbean differ from U.S. born African Americans and
Black immigrants from Africa in rates of high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. These differences may be
due in part to the greater Caucasian European Admixture (~25%) in African Americans compared with African
Caribbeans (~6%). Yet, despite the clear scientific premise and need – there are no studies specifically designed
to thoroughly examine physical function in African Caribbeans. Over the past 20 years, we have been studying
a large cohort of African Caribbean men and women from Tobago in whom we have extensive measures of
lifestyle habits, family and medical history, body composition, and biospecimens. We found that African
Caribbeans have more lean mass (estimated muscle mass), but weaker muscle strength and higher levels of
muscle fat than US adults. We have also discovered that changes in fat mass, but not lean mass, are important
for future walking ability. However, many important gaps remain, and it is critical to expand measures of physical
performance in this cohort. Therefore, we are proposing to address these gaps in the field by directly measuring
skeletal muscle mass (d3 creatine dilution [D3Cr]) and performing deeper phenotyping of physical performance
measures at each level in the disablement pathway to gain a comprehensive understanding of physical
performance in this unique cohort of 1700 African Caribbeans. Aim 1 will use a wealth of existing data to test the
hypothesis that both risk and protective factors more pronounced in African Caribbeans – specifically higher
genetic African admixture, diabetes, and muscle fat infiltration - will be associated with changes in physical
function with aging. Aims 2 and 3 will focus on new measures of body composition and physical performance
that we are proposing to collect to test the hypotheses that: 1) lower muscle mass and greater muscle fat
infiltration will be related to greater fatigability and worse physical performance, and 2) that poorer fat oxidation
during walking will be associated with greater total fat and muscle fat, as well as greater fatigability and worse
physical performance. Successful completion of these aims will provide the first direct assessment of skeletal
muscle mass and comprehensive investigation of physical performance in African Caribbeans, a vastly under-
studied, but rapidly growing population and lay the foundation for future investigations. These data can be
harnessed in future efforts to improve, prevention, and treatment of age-related declines in physical performance."

Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) elements are physically and topologically distinct components of
eukaryotic genomes that can contribute to intercellular copy-number variation, environmental adaptations, and
functional genomic diversity. Recently, high-throughput sequencing has made extensive genomic mapping of
eccDNA sequences possible. Notwithstanding this major advance, information regarding biogenesis of these
circular DNAs and causal connections between these DNA elements and human pathologies, remains extremely
limited. The sequences, structure, and biological properties of eccDNA molecules constitute a major knowledge
gap, information about which can lead to strategies targeting disease-specific eccDNA structure and function.
eccDNAs represent a large range of molecules (~100 bp to >1 Mbp) and coexist with eccDNAs found in normal
somatic cells; isolating and characterizing different classes of eccDNA comes with their own host of unique
challenges. To address these knowledge gaps, methods that can directly interrogate all circular DNA species in
the cell are critically needed.
In this FastTrack SBIR proposal, Phinomics, Inc. is developing is developing an innovative urine-based test that
will isolate eccDNA molecules in an intact state suitable for next-generation sequencing and epigenetic
characterization, and is complemented by a suite of biophysical and novel bioinformatic methods to identify and
define these molecules. In Phase I, Phinomics will 1) Demonstrate the capability of Phinomics’ proprietary
technology to isolate comprehensive/unbiased eccDNA repertoires (circulomes) from human cell lines; and 2)
Demonstrate the capability of Phinomics’ technology to robustly sequence, map, assemble, and informatically
profile the isolated circulome. Upon meeting Phase I Go/No-Go milestones, in Phase II Phinomics will 3) Validate
Phinomics’ technology as a molecular platform for bladder cancer diagnostic applications; 4) Extend the
application of Phinomics’ technologies to biological fluid samples; and 5) Develop a PCR test to detect circular
DNA species in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer to enable CLIA certification.
Preliminary data has begun to illuminate the circulome in normal somatic cell lines and tissues, glioblastoma
tumor samples, and plasma, potentiating the use of eccDNA as a valuable biomarker in both solid- and liquid-
biopsy applications. Surveillance based on eccDNA biomarkers is aimed at a minimally invasive strategy to
determine the immune response to therapies, predict recurrence likelihood, and monitor residual disease."

The goal of the Administrative Core of the Cancer Research and Education to Advance HealTh Equity
(CREATE) Partnership is to provide strategic leadership and administrative oversight to advance the
overarching goal of the Partnership. This includes providing an efficient infrastructure to support all scientific,
administrative, and fiscal activities of the Partnership to ensure effective synergy within and across San Diego
State University (SDSU) and the UC San Diego (UCSD) Moores Cancer Center (MCC). Additional goals
include developing cancer research opportunities and pathways for undergraduate, graduate, and medical
students as well as early-stage investigators (ESIs), which will lead to a future workforce that is more diverse
and reflective of the catchment-area population. As a single unit, the Administrative Core provides strategic
leadership and administrative oversight to advance Partnership goals. The Core is the glue that keeps the
Partnership together, and due to its extensive experience and history, it is able to provide necessary services
to support an efficient administrative system and infrastructure under the leadership of multiple Principal
Investigators. The Administrative Core is structured so that the Partnership leaders can establish and
implement a highly integrated operation that ensures exponential benefit from the collaboration of the two
institutions. The Core works synergistically to effectively implement the CREATE Partnership activities in
cancer research, research education, early-stage faculty career development, and community outreach. To
accomplish Partnership goals, the CREATE leadership proposes the following Specific Aims: 1) Provide
leadership, coordination, and management to the scientific, administrative, and fiscal components of the
CREATE Partnership. 2) Promote evidence-based and sustainable interactions and build new research
collaborations across the Partnership. 3) Procure scientific and strategic feedback and guidance from internal
and external advisors. 4) Assist in recruitment of ESIs and work with the Transforming fAcuLty dEvelopmeNT
for Equity (TALENT) Shared Resource to support their career development. The AC is positioned to build
strong institutional commitment to cancer research and cancer disparities research, while growing the
Partnership’s research education programs and increasing outreach to the communities and their providers in
the Southern Border Region of California. By the end of this project period, the Partnership intends to grow the
cancer research base at SDSU by at least 25% and the number of peer reviewed funded cancer disparities
and/or community-engaged grants by at least 20%."
10929490,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT – PILOT PROJECT
Reproductive health care in cancer patients is an unmet need in Imperial County, a medically underserved,
rural region of the Cancer Research and Education to Advance HealTh Equity (CREATE) Partnership’s
catchment area with a predominantly Hispanic population. Reproductive health is a major issue for adolescent
and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors because they can experience higher risks of infertility, adverse
pregnancy outcomes, and unmet informational needs. Reproductive health care effectively reduces risks, but
uptake is low because there are no scalable interventions to support the implementation of routine reproductive
health care in underserved, geographically remote communities. Guided by the Cancer Survivorship Care
Quality Framework, this pilot proposal seeks to adapt and pilot test a multi-component intervention to improve
reproductive health care uptake by female AYA cancer survivors. The intervention has three components
derived from our prior work: 1) a reproductive risk summary (RS) and survivorship care plan on reproductive
health (SCP-R), 2) navigation, and 3) telehealth reproductive consults. In Aim 1, we will adapt the RS and
SCP-R in English and Spanish to be responsive to the cultural, health literacy, and socio-ecological needs of
Latina AYA survivors through focus groups with AYA survivors and parents/guardians, and semi-structured
interviews with healthcare providers. We will also systematically evaluate barriers and facilitators to
reproductive health care in Imperial County and examine how to fit the multi-component intervention to this
setting, through focus groups with survivors and parents/guardians and interviews with healthcare providers
and clinic staff. In Aim 2, we will conduct feasibility testing of the multicomponent intervention in a single arm
pilot hybrid type 1 trial (evaluating effectiveness and observing implementation). The primary outcome is
engagement in reproductive health care by 15 newly diagnosed and 15 post-treatment AYA survivors.
Secondarily, we will qualitatively assess effectiveness, fit and implementation outcomes with AYA survivors,
healthcare providers and health clinic staff. The proposal directly targets a critical health disparity faced by
female AYA survivors in our catchment area and need for partnership between rural community health
professionals and urban specialists to deliver quality reproductive survivorship care. We will generate a novel,
scalable intervention and preliminary data to support a future multi-site trial on intervention effectiveness in
increasing reproductive care in rural, medically underserved oncology settings. The partnership between
SDSU, CRCD and UCSD researchers will be strengthened with collaborative learning, community
engagement, and increased capacity of trainees to support future cancer research in Imperial County."

The Planning and Evaluation (P&E) Core of the Cancer Research and Education to Advance HealTh Equity
(CREATE) Partnership will implement a comprehensive, mixed-method, and outcome-oriented evaluation of all
CREATE’s activities and components. Using innovative evaluation methods that are integrated into all
Partnership components, the P&E Core addresses its overarching goal: To develop, implement, and sustain a
framework that drives rigorous ongoing evaluation to support the scientific and programmatic goals of the
Partnership. To accomplish this, the Partnership proposes the following Specific Aims: 1) Leverage existing
internal expertise within both institutions by engaging the Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) in internal
planning and assessing research, core, and shared resource activities; 2) Implement an innovative, efficient,
and rigorous mechanism for soliciting and evaluating new pilot projects and evaluating the progress of existing
Partnership-sponsored projects; 3) Utilize the external evaluation expertise, provided by highly experienced,
unbiased, multidisciplinary experts, of CREATEs Program Steering Committee (PSC) and Community Advisory
Board (CAB), to achieve the Partnerships stated goals and objectives; 4) Build and maintain a continuous
planning, evaluation, and tracking system using a approach to provide CREATE Partnership leadership with
metrics to make data driven decisions throughout all Partnership activities and components. To achieve P&E
Core aims, internal and external experts will be engaged including: 1) a collaborative Multiple Principal
Investigator group (MPI); 2) a larger Executive Committee made up of the MPIs, Program Managers, CREATE
Undergraduate Scholars Program director, Core and Shared Resource Leads, and an Evaluation Lead; 3) a
multidisciplinary IAC; 4) a PSC composed of external members with appropriate scientific expertise; and 5) an
external CAB made up of community partners organizations. CREATE MPIs will lead the planning component
and an evaluation lead will direct all evaluation efforts independently of the MPIs. The expected impact is to: 1)
advance cancer health equity in underserved communities in the Southern Border Region of California; 2)
further increase SDSU’s cancer research capacities, 3) expand SDSU’s and UCSD’s cancer health disparities
and community-engaged research, 4) build a pipeline of a diverse biomedical workforce, largely focused on
undergraduate, graduate and medical students and early stage investigators underrepresented in the
biomedical workforce. Based on the goals of the selected full and pilot projects included in this application,
CREATE expects major advancements in reducing disparities related to the following areas: 1) contribute to
the development of a novel therapeutic strategy to be tested in future clinical trials, 2) provide actionable
information to stakeholders, regarding inequity in cancer patient’s access to telehealth and; 3) generate a novel
multicomponent intervention that adapts care delivery to address reproductive health among rural and Hispanic
female adolescent and young adult cancer survivors."

The Hispanic/Latino (H/L) communities in the Ponce and Tampa Bay regions experience both shared and unique
challenges associated with poverty, access to care, and language. The Ponce Health Sciences University
(PHSU) in Puerto Rico (PR) and the Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) in Florida have forged a strong relationship
and leveraged their respective strengths and resources to address these needs with the ultimate goal of
eliminating cancer health disparities. The 15-year Partnership has established joint programs for basic and
clinical research, cancer outreach, cancer education, and training, and biobanking, building networks of
investigators focused on cancer disparities and infrastructure for sustained long-term collaboration. Combined
with the establishment and growth of a unique biobanking resource for H/L and the integration of quantitative
sciences expertise, this dynamic environment is a catalyst for the recruitment of new faculty at PHSU in basic
and translational cancer research, increases the health disparities research focus at MCC and stimulates
innovative cancer research. To ensure a durable impact, the Partnership fosters the development of cancer
researchers and clinicians through an exchange of research and medical trainees between institutions and
supporting the successful advancement of Early-Stage Investigators (ESIs). The Partnership and our outreach
activities continue to be integral in promoting cancer health in our H/L communities and has provided vital support
for overcoming two major hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, and the COVID pandemic. The challenges,
achievements, and lessons learned to provide a strong basis to guide the evolution and further expansion of this
Partnership, whose primary goals are to reduce cancer disparities in the Hispanic/Latino (H/L) communities and
to contribute to the elimination of health disparities in the population at large. The specific aims for the U54
Partnership renewal are (1) Increase Partnership investigators and collaborations committed to innovative
cancer health disparities research, creating long-term sustainability. This will be accomplished through the
engagement of faculty and ESIs with resources to support collaborations, grant preparations, publications, and
networking. (2) Identify and foster the growth of diverse trainees for a career in cancer research and health
disparities. We will support the recruitment and development of trainees from diverse backgrounds across the
career continuum with an emphasis on H/L. (3) Support novel research projects that will contribute to the
identification and elimination of cancer health disparities in H/L. We will foster the development of projects
that investigate the biological basis, psychological and social factors of cancer disparities through a rigorous
evaluation of research projects that have the potential to reduce specific disparity gaps. (4) Increase community
engagement in cancer health disparities research. This will be accomplished by fostering community
engagement, including bi-directional activities, education, increased social media presence, and dialogue with
the research component and activities of our Community Health Educator."

 My goal in pursuing a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to gain the necessary training,
knowledge, and practical experience needed to become an independent investigator focused on improving
access to and utilization of PrEP among Black men who have sex with men (BSMM) through social, peer-
based intervention research. To continue my progress towards my career goals, I propose to conduct an
intervention focused on increasing PrEP acceptability through developing and maintaining peer support and
resilience to intersectional racism and homophobia among BSMM in Prince George’s County, MD. Despite a
clear, well-documented need for greater uptake of PrEP among BSMM in this county, PrEP uptake among
BSMM in this setting remains low, and extant literature specific to PrEP use in this setting and population is
extremely limited. To address this need, I propose the following: Specific Aims: 1) Understand peer-peer
interactions/exchanges and HIV prevention communications among BSMM through ethnographic qualitative
observations (participant and direct) of two ongoing MPowerment models, 2) conduct qualitative in depth
interviews to inform designing an intervention to reduce internalized racism, internalized homophobia and
increase PrEP initiation among BSMM in PG County, and 3) pilot test a community-based intervention (130
participants) to reduce internalized racism, internalized homophobia, and HIV stigma and increase social
support and PrEP initiation among BSMM in PG County, based on the MPowerment model.
 In addition to my specific aims, my Specific Career Development Aims are the following: 1) To
develop expertise in the analysis of qualitative data, particularly related to social and structural factors, 2) to
develop expertise in the collection and analysis of network data collected via respondent driven sampling, 3) to
gain experience in the design, conduct, and evaluation of interventions and 4) to develop research
management and professional development skills needed to lead future independent research projects. The
knowledge and experience gained from the proposed research will provide me the skillset necessary to
successfully compete for R01 funding to conduct a larger scale peer-focused intervention to promote PrEP
acceptability and adherence among BSMM. The proposal makes significant contributions to the field in several
ways, including 1) identifying barriers to PrEP acceptability among BSMM in Prince George’s County, 2)
Qualitatively understand factors that may impact observed quantitative associations between barriers and
PrEP use and acceptability, and 3) developing and evaluating an MPowerment intervention to improve PrEP
use and acceptability in this population. My rigorous education, training, and research experience in social
determinants of HIV/STI risk, collaborations with BSMM populations and organizations, proficiency with
quantitative data analysis, and the expertise of my multidisciplinary research team, uniquely prepares me to
conduct the proposed research and significantly contribute to HIV prevention science."
10766115,"Harmful substance use (alcohol, tobacco, and/or prescription opioids) is common and twin studies suggest a
substantial genetic role. Further, combined use of alcohol with tobacco and tobacco with opioids, commonly
occurs suggesting that environmental and genetic risks for these behaviors overlap. However, identified
genetic variation explains only a small proportion of the phenotypic variation for individual or combined
substance use. Studies aiming to identify shared genetic pathways across substances (pleiotropy) have
yielded inconsistent results. Among the major challenges to gene finding for these traits are phenotypic
ambiguity, measurement bias, and inadequate statistical power to detect the small genetic effects associated
with complex disorders. Individual clinical assessments often do not capture all substances of interest or
relevant clinical factors (e.g., chronic pain) and are subject to substantial variation and bias depending upon
the patient's health state, the clinical setting in which the assessment occurs, and the clinician making the
assessment. Administrative International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes derived from these
assessments are frequently used because they are readily available for large numbers of subjects, but they
can add another layer of inaccuracy and bias. The unique, rich, longitudinal clinical data available within the
Veterans Healthcare Administration (VA) combined with data available from the Million Veteran Program
(MVP) is enabling us to overcome these limitations. We began with widely available and repeated electronic
health record (EHR)-based metrics: AUDIT-C for hazardous alcohol; current/past/never smoking status for
tobacco; and morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) from pharmacy fill/refill records for prescription opioids.
Longitudinal summary metrics derived from these measures were initially validated in the Veterans Aging
Cohort Study (VACS) and then extended to MVP, validating them against additional criterion standards and in
a much larger, more generalizable, sample. Importantly, MVP also allowed us to validate against genetic
criterion standards, previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This yielded Electronic
Health Record (EHR)-based, CritErion-validated Longitudinal (ExCEL) phenotypes that were substantially
more strongly associated with criterion and content standards for alcohol (1, 2), tobacco (3), and prescription
opioids [Becker, in preparation] than alternative phenotypes. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of
alcohol, tobacco, and opioids using ExCEL phenotypes are underway and have both reproduced prior findings
and yielded many novel associations of SNPs and genes with these conditions. We have shared ExCEL
phenotypes with Alpha and Beta project groups via the MVP wiki and the MVP Phenotype Workgroup. We are
currently conducting joint GWASs of ExCEL phenotypes for tobacco and alcohol (Zhao and Dao) and will soon
initiate joint GWASs of ExCEL phenotypes for tobacco and opioids. Because chronic pain is strongly
associated with substance use, we propose to develop, validate, and apply an ExCEL phenotype of chronic
pain using repeated measures of the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS) and validating it against functional
impairment due to pain from the MVP survey and a genetic risk score based on previously identified SNPs. In
the next four years, we will use ExCEL phenotypes to conduct GWASs of substance use (alcohol, tobacco,
and prescription opioids) and chronic pain, treating chronic pain as a confounder, as a necessary exposure,
and as a unifying genetic link. We expect that our analyses will reveal the extent to which genetic factors are
shared between chronic pain and substance use and shed light on how pain may influence the expression of
genetic risk factors for substance-related traits."
10766116,"Project Summary/Abstract
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are broadly expressed in the CNS where they modulate the release
of key neurotransmitters involved in learning, mood, and reward. nAChRs are also found in diverse non-
neuronal tissues including immune cells, skin, gastro-intestinal epithelium and breast tumors. Research in our
laboratory, which has been funded by R01 GM103801 and a project of P01 GM48677, is focused on enabling
mechanistic understanding of how nAChRs regulate signaling at the single cell and systems levels. Venoms
from predatory marine snails, known as Conus, are the richest known source of diverse, evolutionarily-refined
ligands that target nAChRs. We have made substantial progress in developing peptides from these venoms
that are selective for α6 subunit-containing subtypes of nAChRs. These peptides have been widely used to
demonstrate that specific nAChR subtypes modulate key dopaminergic circuits that are strongly implicated in
the addictive properties of drugs and in movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. Separately, we
made groundbreaking progress in validating the α9α10 nAChR as a novel target for treatment of neuropathic
pain. We enabled such progress by developing potent and highly selective conopeptides. Over the next 5
years, an overarching goal of our research program will be to develop robust suites of potent, highly selective
conopeptide-based probes for the study of additional subtypes of nAChRs. We will continue to exploit the
resulting compounds for applications in medicine. A particular focus will be to develop new ligands with high
specificity for nAChR subtypes of non-neuronal cells. The most widely expressed nAChRs in non-neuronal
cells have α7, α9, α10 and α5 subunits where our insight into function is limited. We will utilize the resulting
peptide probes to examine the structures and functions of these nAChR subtypes. We have demonstrated that
block of α9α10 nAChRs is analgesic in multiple animal models of neuropathic pain. Of high interest to us, is
that selective conopeptides not only alleviate neuropathic pain, but they also prevent development of, or
accelerate recovery from, nerve injury. Thus, the underlying therapeutic mechanism has significant implications
for truly disease-modifying therapies. We will test the hypothesis that modulation of nAChRs in non-neuronal
cells is key to understanding disease modification observed in models of trauma-, chemotherapy- and
diabetes-induced nerve injury."
10766260,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pseudomonas aeruginosa poses a major threat to human health due to limited treatment options and its
ability to become resistant to antibiotics. P. aeruginosa and other Gram-negative bacteria are particularly
difficult to treat because their asymmetric outer membranes, comprising an electronegative matrix of
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer leaflet, form an electrostatic barrier excluding most antibiotics. The
candidate aims apply advanced genomic, genetic and chemical biological strategies to study this important
human pathogen, both to develop novel therapeutic agents and to gain insights into the basic biology of
vulnerable targets. In work in progress, recent target-focused, whole cell screening identified 128 small
molecules hypothesized to kill P. aeruginosa by disrupting LPS transport to the outer membrane. In Aim 1,
with small molecule hits in hand, the candidate proposes to develop these compounds by optimizing their
activities and establishing their mechanisms of action. To this end, the candidate has already developed high-
throughput gene expression profiling methods to identify and prioritize hits that induce transcriptional
responses in LPS transport pathways. Preliminary data revealed one lead candidate, C0918, induced a
transcriptional response remarkably similar to that of a known LPS transport inhibitor, demonstrating that
mechanisms of action can be inferred by gene responses compared to those of known antibiotics. Drawing on
his background in protein science, when putative target proteins emerge, the candidate outlines strategies for
protein expression, purification, direct-binding studies, and structure determination by cryogenic electron
microscopy.
Lead compounds in Aim 1 will also serve as valuable molecular probes to investigate the regulatory pathways
underpinning LPS biosynthesis and transport in Aim 2. The candidate will perform a genetic screen to
discover LPS regulatory genes in P. aeruginosa by mutagenizing an engineered reporter strain, which encodes
fluorescent proteins marking expression levels of key LPS synthesis and transport genes. To complemental
screening efforts, the candidate will also characterize single and double mutants encoding regulated copies of
these key genes in LPS biosynthesis and transport, aimed at determining phenotypic consequences when LPS
biosynthetic intermediates buildup under conditions of high LPS synthesis but low transport.
With the guidance of his mentor, Dr. Deb Hung, the candidate has developed a five-year training program to
provide both the technical and didactic training necessary to become an independent physician-scientist
focused on using small molecules to target LPS transport, while also gaining insights into its underlying
regulatory machinery in P. aeruginosa. Importantly, this project will be overseen by a scientific advisory
committee providing expertise in key areas of this proposal, including LPS biology, bacterial genetics,
genomics, and chemical biology. Throughout the career development award period, the candidate will expand
his knowledge base with complete didactic and hands-on training. The candidate will complete coursework in
bioinformatics and statistics to help with analyzing genomic-wide datasets. This proposal therefore
provides the necessary training and scientific foundation to achieve Dr. Romano's ultimate goal
of becoming a RO1-funded physician-scientist who applies advanced genomic and chemical
biological techniques to study and treat bacterial pathogens."

The Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center (MMRRC) Consortium is the nation’s primary mutant
mouse archive and distribution repository system. The MMRRC Consortium was established by the NIH to
ensure the preservation, dissemination, and development of valuable mutant mouse strains and data
generated by research scientists, and especially now plays a key role in supporting rigor and reproducibility of
experimental results using model animals. The MMRRC Consortium was constituted as a trans-national
regionally-distributed network of four Centers each hosting an archive and distribution repository, one of which
is located at UC Davis (MMRRC-UCD), and an Informatics Coordination and Service Center (ICSC), also
coincidentally located at UC Davis. In coordination with other members of the MMRRC Consortium, the
MMRRC-UCD serves the needs of the nation’s biomedical research community by ensuring access to and
optimizing utilization of transgenic, knockout and other genetically engineered mutant mice and related
biomaterials, services, and new technologies. To do so, the MMRRC-UCD imports, verifies, maintains, and
distributes mice, gene-targeted embryonic stem (ES) cells, and germplasm of genetically unique, scientifically
valuable mice that are essential for contemporary translational biomedical research. The MMRRC-UCD also
provide services and procedures to assist investigators using genetically-altered mice for research in
numerous areas including cancer, neurodegenerative, metabolic, developmental, genetic, and other diseases.
Finally, the MMRRC-UCD conducts resource-related research and develops and refines technologies, that add
scientific value to submitted mutant mouse strains, and that capitalize on the power of mouse genetics for
biomedical research. By submitting their mice to the MMRRC Consortium, and upon acceptance, assignment,
and deposition into the MMRRC-UCD (or any of the other 3 Centers), investigators fulfill their obligation under
the NIH Data and Resource Sharing Policies. In return, the MMRRC-UCD strives to preserve, protect, quality

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We will continue our study of biopolymers and their interactions at two levels. At the molecular
network level, we will study the A) probability landscape of stochastic networks of molecular
reactions. We will develop efficient computational tools to construct exact probability landscapes in
high-dimension, quantify probability discrete fluxes, and characterize their exact topology. These
powerful tools will be applied to gain mechanistic understanding of stochastic control of network
phenotypes in a number of important biological problems. At the (sub)cellular level, we will study B)
biophysics of 3D chromatin folding. We will develop algorithms to identify driver interactiomes that
can generate large ensembles of accurate models of single-cell 3D chromatin conformations
consistent with Hi-C and single-cell experimental data. Our methods will be applied to study
foundational problems of 3D genome to gain understanding of principles of genome organization.
In A), we will study stochastic reaction networks of molecules to gain mechanistic understanding of
their behavior. Many important cellular processes involve a small copy number of molecules of
transcription factors, enzymes, and signaling molecules. Stochasticity and rare events arising from
such low copy number reactions are important for processes such as embryonic development, stem
cell differentiation, and nongenetic heterogeneity. Our approach will be based on the fundamental
framework of the stochastic kinetic processes and the discrete chemical master equation (dCME).
The central tasks are: 1) constructing the probability landscape of the network, and from which to 2)
gain analytical insight into mechanism of network behavior. For 1), we have developed the ACME
method that can construct the exact probability landscapes of a large class of complex stochastic
reaction networks and will make further improvement. For 2), we will develop landscape analysis
tools using persistent homology that can compute the exact topology of the high-dimensional
probability landscape. We have also developed the concept of discrete fluxes and methods for its
computation. We will further formulate and generalize the concept of discrete rotational flux to higher
dimension. These developments will enable global and mechanistic understanding of the behavior of
stochastic networks through accurately constructed probability landscape and exactly computed
topological structures. Our work will open up new frontiers for investigations, many of which are
currently not computationally feasible. Specifically, we will construct probability landscapes of
networks, study how global flux maps evolve and how phenotype switching occur. We will generalize
the discovery of stochastic oscillation and investigate higher-order oscillatory behavior of networks,
where probability mass may be transferred through higher-dimensional k-channels. In addition, we
will carry-out in-depth analysis on a selected set of important biological problems, including stochastic
control of mRNA splicing/transcription at single-cell level, initiation of protein fibril aggregation,
network architectures for multi-stability and maintenance of epigenetic states, and switching of
cellular phenotypes.
In B), we will study the biophysical principles of 3D genome organization. We will develop
computational tools to generate thoroughly sampled large ensembles of coarse-grained polymer
models of 3D chromatin structures based on experimental Hi-C and other data. We will develop
strategies to study a number of fundamental problems: We will determine and uncover the minimal
sets of critical driver interactions sufficient to determine folding of chromatin at specific loci and at
whole chromosome level. We will further investigate how chromatin-nuclear envelope interactions,
along with chromatin driver interactome, nuclear bodies, and speckles, orchestrate the overall 3D
genome organization. We will decipher the persistent driver interactomes at different genomic loci,
which are preserved across different tissues and are responsible for the formation of common
genomic structural scaffolds and folding landscapes. We will also identify adaptive interactomes that
differ among tissues and inferring how they evolve and rewire during development. We will further
infer how these temporally evolving structural interactomes spatially arrange genomic elements and
how they may influence structural gene accessibility at genome scale.

Despite not having a nervous system, plants have exceptional capacities to communicate between cells
and organs. Being sessile, this is vital for adaptation to animal herbivory (organ regeneration), extreme
temperatures, pathogens at all levels, etc. Interestingly, plants have evolved an expanded family of
glutamate receptors, proteins gated by glutamate to generate electric and calcium signals, which are well
known for their crucial role in the human nervous system and many of its related pathologies. My lab has
been leading the field of plant GLutamate Receptor (GLR) research. We pioneered their demonstration as
ion channels involved in cell-cell communication, and, among other, further studied their evolution, roles
in sexual reproduction, or functions of GLR-associated regulatory proteins. Under grant R01GM131043
we extended our scope to generate the first structural views of GLRs. Cryo-EM revealed a surprising
conservation of structural mechanisms with their animal homologues (iGluRs) but also many differences,
e.g. ligand promiscuity, non-canonical gating properties and different ionic selectivity. Globally these
features revealed functions in electrical communication and ligand-gated Ca2+ store homeostasis for GLRs.
Taking advantage of novel methodology that permits reasonable prediction from sequence and
homologous structures, we are now re-iterating GLR function and their physiological roles by generating
protein activity predictions by structural and molecular dynamics computational simulations. Specifically,
we are targeting ligand specificity, structural topologies affecting gating and de-sensitization speeds, and
ion selectivity. We posit these properties to be crucial for GLR-based physiology and will explore this
strategy to break the barrier posed by genetic/functional redundancy resulting from the elevated gene copy
number (20 in Arabidopsis, many more in other plants; 14 in humans). Our current efforts are focused in
developing these approaches and establishing new protocols for validation of structural predictions from
modeling. These will include validation of altered GLR properties by expression of combinations of mutated
glutamate receptors and accessory proteins on heterologous systems. Modifications likely to generate
either dominant-negative or -positive functional phenotypes will be knocked into our reference collection
of GLR mutants and screened for function. We will target complementation of backgrounds with multiple
mutations in diverse clades, and will screen for plausible functions of GLR roles, namely innate immunity,
organ regeneration and abiotic stresses. Ion imaging and single-cell transcriptomics of promising lines will
be further investigated for signaling and transcriptional pathways which are affected by GLR function.
Given that plant GLRs evolved physiological functions out of topologies and motifs that are associated
with disease when present in human glutamate receptors, notably in the “orphan” Glu-∂ sub-family, our
results should also address intriguing medical questions related to these structural aspects."
10767180,"Major surgery is a common event in the lives of community-living older persons, with a 5-year cumulative inci-
dence of 13.8%, representing nearly 5 million persons aged 65 years or older in the US. This value will in-
crease substantially in the coming years based on the projected doubling of this age group to 98 million by
2060. As our society ages, it is also becoming increasingly diverse, with growing proportions of racial/ethnic
minorities and other disadvantaged groups. Yet, despite the public health imperative, disparities in outcomes
after major surgery in disadvantaged older persons are poorly understood. Prior research has generally relied
on large administrative datasets and, hence, has usually been restricted to disadvantaged populations defined
only by individual-level demographic characteristics, a small number of short-term outcomes, and a limited set
of explanatory variables. To address current gaps in knowledge, and build the evidence for action, a more ro-
bust approach is needed that focuses on multiple disadvantaged populations of older persons, emphasizes the
importance of social contextual factors in defining the scope and complexity of disadvantage, includes a larger
array of geriatric-specific outcomes that are clinically meaningful, evaluates a comprehensive set of explana-
tory variables that include modifiable patient-centered variables, and assesses the use of post-surgical pallia-
tive treatments such as hospice. The overarching objective of this proposal is to identify and elucidate sources
of potential disparities in outcomes after major surgery in disadvantaged older populations, defined on the ba-
sis of individual-level and social contextual factors. Building on our prior work, we will use high-quality data
from the National Health and Aging and Trends Study (NHATS), an ongoing nationally representative longitudi-
nal study that includes 7,600+ community-living persons aged 65+ years with oversampling of Blacks, compre-
hensive annual assessments with patient-centered phenotypic data that are not available in administrative da-
tasets, cohort replenishment at 5-year intervals, and linkages to Medicare and geographic data. This unique
resource will permit a series of innovative longitudinal analyses at the patient level that will complement sys-
tems-based research on the quality of surgical care. We will rigorously test three distinct but related hypothe-
ses: (1) disparities after major surgery in older persons will be observed consistently for multiple outcomes
across multiple disadvantaged populations; (2) for each disadvantaged population, these disparities in out-
comes will be largely attributable to a set of patient-centered variables, including several that are potentially
modifiable; and (3) similar disparities will be observed in the use of hospice but will not be as easily explained.
By taking a comprehensive, multifactorial, and multilevel approach that emphasizes the importance of social
contextual factors, the proposed research will build the evidence that is essential to understanding the mecha-
nisms of potential disparities in outcomes after major surgery. These actionable results will inform novel inter-
ventions, collaborations, and policies designed to improve these outcomes in disadvantaged older persons."
10767183,"An efficient hemodynamics with minimal thrombosis risk post-surgery is essential for short- and long-term
success of a cardiac surgery. Achieving this is a challenge in cardiac surgery that involves the design of a
complex flow pathway. Aortic arch reconstruction, aneurysm repair, Fontan surgeries are a few examples.
 The Fontan surgical procedure is the most effective palliative treatment for patients with single ventricle
defects (SVD). SVD refers to a collection of congenital heart diseases where one of the lower ventricular
chambers of the heart remains underdeveloped. Fontan procedure involves re-routing of deoxygenated blood
from upper and lower body to flow directly to lungs allowing the single functioning ventricle to pump blood for
systemic circulation. Though lifesaving, the Fontan physiology creates a non-natural pathway for venous return
of the blood to the lungs thus producing a non-physiological blood flow. A successful Fontan procedure should
involve 1) well-balanced overall and hepatic venous flow return to lungs to prevent pulmonary arteriovenous
malformations (PAVMs) that can lead to poor gas exchange, 2) minimal energy loss, and 3) minimal thrombosis
(blood clot) risk. Complications such as PAVMs and thrombosis post-surgery can result in a Fontan failure.
 To improve Fontan surgical planning, its efficacy and predictability, we propose to develop an automated
image-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) workflow capable of optimizing and predicting all the above
determinants for a successful Fontan physiology. CFD models have been developed in the past to assess energy
loss and hepatic venous flow distribution, but an automated computational tool for rapidly optimizing the patients'
Fontan physiology in terms of factors affecting success does not exist. To fill this gap, we will integrate our
existing patient-specific Fontan surgical planning protocol to predict energy loss and hepatic venous flow
distribution with 1) a shape optimization algorithm and 2) our validated model of blood coagulation to provide a
computational tool to virtually improve the planned Fontan physiology for optimal hepatic and overall venous
return to lungs, minimal energy loss and thrombotic potential and quantitatively predict thrombosis risk. We will
completely automate our workflow with custom scripts to minimize errors and user intervention. Our biochemical
model of blood coagulation has all the components representing platelet and fibrin deposition and is 2-way
coupled with blood flow. The continuum-based approach of this model allows it to be used in large geometries.
After rigorous validation of our surgical optimization workflow using MRI-based patient specific in-vitro models,
we will perform virtual surgeries using our tool and retrospective patient data to establish clinical applicability.
 Our tool could potentially be 1) included in the current surgical planning workflow to perform virtual surgeries
using patient pre-op data to improve and predict surgical outcomes, and 2) used to evaluate risk of clotting post-
Fontan so that patients can be selectively monitored. Our long-term objective is to provide a prospective surgical
planning tool for Fontan and then extend it other surgeries where such optimization can improve surgical efficacy."
10767246,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The PROTECT (Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats) Superfund Research Center (SRC)
includes four research projects, two research support cores and three required enrichment cores, one of which
is the Administrative Core. The primary objective of the Administrative Core is to provide a formal structure for
oversight, planning, coordination, and promotion of cross-disciplinary, multi-university interaction by projects
and cores. The secondary, equally vital objective is the translation of research to stakeholders.
The specific aims of the Administrative Core are to (1) provide center direction and planning, (2) provide fiscal
management and administrative services, (3) maintain active communication with NIEHS/SRP; (4) promote
center activities and research results to all relevant stakeholders in scientific communities, government, and
industry, and (5) develop investigator-initiated research translation activities for each project, including
technology transfer and training on research translation.
To accomplish these aims requires a sophisticated administrative structure, particularly for a geographically
distributed, multi-university team. Substantial planning, organization, and effective communications tools
promote active collaboration and coordination. To this end, the Administrative Core has developed a
framework that links projects, cores, institutions and participants. This includes highly-qualified and
experienced Center Directors who manage and guide PROTECT research, training and stakeholder
engagement activities; an Executive Committee to manage, facilitate and monitor the technical quality of
projects and cores; a Research Translation Coordinator to oversee research translation at the project and
center levels, and a dedicated Administrative Staff who support PROTECT research and administrative
activities using appropriate information technology, financial and reporting software and communications tools.
To advise and guide the effort, an External Advisory Committee formed of four subcommittees focuses on
important issues; the Scientific Advisory Committee assesses research merit, cross-disciplinary integration,
translation and relevance; the Institutional Partnership Advisory Committee provides necessary institutional-
level guidance and promotes long-range strategic goals; and Training, and Community Engagement Advisory
Committees support their respective cores. Frequent, routine management and coordination/integration
meetings are planned for optimal participation by PROTECT personnel and advisors. This effective strategy
has been used since PROTECT was established in 2010, resulting in collaboration and integration across
projects, cores and institutions, successful communication with advisory committees and external
stakeholders, and timely, accurate financial tracking and progress reporting to NIEHS/SRP."
10807113,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nominating candidate risk genes and gene sets underlying disease-critical processes is of utmost importance
for developing drug targets and informing CRISPR screening experiments. To this end, large scale single-cell
genomic and epigenomic data (from RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, Perturb-seq) can be integrated with genome wide
association studies (GWAS) to enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture of human complex
diseases and traits. In this proposal, I plan to develop new computational approaches to integrate single-
cell functional genomic and epigenomic data with GWAS data for complex diseases and traits to identify
and rank disease-critical genes and gene sets characterizing functional processes, as well as pinpoint
short genomic regions linked to these disease-associated genes. My K99 training will be conducted at the
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, as well as the Broad Institute, under the mentorship of Dr. Alkes
Price. The key areas of my training will be to develop and evaluate approaches for gene-level and gene set-level
functional architecture of diseases and traits and integrative analysis of single-cell, as well as bulk, functional
genomics data with human disease genetics. My proposed approaches will attempt to bridge the gap between
functional genomics and human genetics and downstream clinical drug/gene intervention experiments. The long-
term goal of this research is to produce a set of computational tools that identify and rank top disease-critical
genes, top disease-critical gene sets characterizing cell types or cellular processes and gene-linked genomic
regions for each disease/trait. These approaches will reshape our understanding of the functional architecture
of human diseases at cellular level and will inform future drug perturbation and CRISPR screening experiments.
The first aim of this proposal is to develop methods to identify and rank disease-critical genes by integrating
common and rare variant disease associations with gene-level functional information derived from single-cell
genomics experiments. Here I will develop, compare and contrast multiple gene prioritization strategies that differ
in how they annotate SNPs for a gene, how they aggregate variant level associations at gene level and how they
use functional data in performing the gene prioritization. The second aim of this proposal is to develop new
computational strategies to assess disease information in sets of genes that underlie a cell type or cellular
processes active within or across cell types in a tissue. The third aim of this proposal is to pinpoint and prioritize
short genomic regions that are either proximally or functionally linked (for example, as an enhancer) to disease-
critical genes and gene sets from Aims 1 and 2. Here, I plan to integrate GWAS association signal near these
gene-linked regions with deep learning models that can infer allelic effects at base pair resolution and single-cell
ATAC-seq data. All disease-critical genes, gene sets and gene-linked regions along with relevant computational
tools will be distributed publicly to the scientific community."

This proposal outlines an integrated training and research plan for Dr. Shangang Zhao to complete
further academic training under the mentorship of Dr. Philipp E. Scherer and transition to an
independent investigator specializing in the field of metabolism and geroscience. The overall objective
of the research proposal is to explore the impact of a novel secreting protein, referred to as “J18” in
healthspan and lifespan. Highly expressed in salivary glands both in mouse and human, large amounts
of glycosylated J18 are secreted into saliva, an easily accessible biomaterial for multiple biomedical
assays. J18 displays a unique pattern of regulation: Its level is increased in metabolically healthy states,
such as fasting and calorie restriction, while decreased in metabolically adverse conditions, such as
aging and obesity. With evidence accumulated from our J18 transgenic and knockout mouse models,
we found that J18 is a novel lipid hydrolase, targeting on a unique lipid class to mediate its potent
effects in promoting metabolic health. In addition, preliminary data suggest that increasing J18 level in
our liver J18 transgenic mouse seems to prolong life span and deficiency of J18 in our J18 global KO
mice reduces median life span. The basic principle of J18 physiology has been conserved remarkably
well from mouse to human. These findings helped us define the physiological role of a previously
unknown protein J18 in metabolic aspect. We will take advantage of our newly generated tissue specific
transgenic and KO mouse models to manipulate systemic J18 level, along with the J18 targeted- unique
lipid class, and will address: 1) saliva-derived J18 may be a potential and novel aging biomarker to
allow easy prediction of an individual's life expectancy; 2) the impact of J18 in healthspan and lifespan.
Combined, these studies will provide significant new insights into the physiological effects of J18 in
healthspan and lifespan. The proposed role of J18 as a potential aging biomarker meets the urgent
need for an easily assayable, validated and effective aging biomarker, and will greatly advance
research in geroscience. Under the auspices of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,
along with the previous experience gained in studying the impact of adiponectin in healthspan, I will be
mentored by internationally recognized leaders in the metabolism, and advised by the top aging experts,
which will greatly facilitate the transition of my research career toward an independent investigator
position."
10767967,"ABSTRACT
 The “magnificent seven” human sirtuins play critical roles in various cellular processes including DNA
repair, gene silencing, mitochondrial biogenesis, insulin secretion and apoptosis. They regulate a wide array of
protein and enzyme targets through their NAD+-dependent deacetylase activities. Sirtuins are also thought to
mediate the beneficial effects of low calorie intake to extend longevity in diverse organisms from yeast to
mammals. Small molecules mimicking calorie restriction to stimulate sirtuin activity are attractive therapeutics
against age-related disorders such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. Little
is known about one of the mitochondrial sirtuins, SIRT5. SIRT5 has emerged as a critical player in maintaining
cardiac health and neuronal viability upon stress, and functions as tumor suppressor in a context specific manner.
Much has been debated about whether SIRT5 has evolved away from being a deacetylase because of its weak
catalytic activity, especially in the in vitro testing. We have, for the first time, identified a SIRT5-selective allosteric
activator, nicotinamide riboside (NR). It can increase SIRT5 deacetylation efficiency with different synthetic
peptide substrates as well as its endogenous cognate substrate. However, the deacylase activity of SIRT5 is
insensitive to NR activation. Mechanism of activation will be further explored in three specific aims. In aim 1, our
effort will be directed at the elucidation of structural determinants required for the differential NR sensitivities and
the identification of allosteric binding site. In aim 2, target engagement and activation of SIRT5 in response to
activator treatment in the cellular context will be investigated. In aim 3, several series of SIRT5 activators will be
synthesized based on our initial screening, structure-activity relationship analysis and docking studies using a
combination of chemical and enzymatic strategies. The knowledge gained in the proposed study will not only
clarify our understanding of the biological functions of SIRT5, but also lead to new therapeutics for metabolic
disorders and age-related diseases."
10767968,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The liver exhibits remarkable capacity for regeneration, but chronic injury or severe acute damage can
overwhelm compensatory responses and result in liver failure. The need for transplantable livers regularly
exceeds the donor pool, necessitating the development of new regenerative medicine-based therapies and a
deeper understanding of the liver’s endogenous repair mechanisms. This proposal seeks a mechanistic
understanding of gene regulatory networks underlying ductular reaction (DR), a damage response associated
with a broad range of liver injury and disease. DR is defined by the proliferative expansion of biliary epithelial
cells (BECs) and can involve context-dependent lineage conversion between mature hepatocytes and BECs that
contributes to tissue regeneration. The genetic regulation of DR remains poorly understood, including how BECs
balance proliferation and phenotypic plasticity. Sox9 is a transcription factor required for stem/progenitor cell
function in a number of epithelial tissues and has been shown to establish cellular identity through genome-wide
effects on the chromatin landscape. In the liver, Sox9 is required for timing of BEC specification in development
and is broadly expressed in adult BECs. Our lab recently used a Sox9EGFP transgene to study BEC heterogeneity
and showed that Sox9 is expressed at distinct levels in subpopulations of BECs and peribiliary hybrid
hepatocytes (HybHeps) during homeostasis and cholestasis. New findings from our lab also demonstrate
abnormalities in BECs of adult Sox9 knockout mice. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that Sox9 functions
as a master regulator of DR, by inhibiting proliferation and promoting BEC identity. The following specific aims
will test this hypothesis: Aim 1A will determine the role of Sox9 in damage induced BEC proliferation, through
the use of the Sox9EGFP allele and (1) combined BEC/hepatocyte or (2) BEC-specific Sox9 knockout mouse
models. Aim 1B will determine the role of Sox9 in bi-directional BEC-to-hepatocyte plasticity, through
complementary in vivo lineage tracing and in vitro organoid assays. Aim 2A will map the chromatin regulatory
landscape of DR, by integrating transcriptomics and chromatin assays in BEC subpopulations during liver injury.
Aim 2B will determine the genomic regulatory impact of Sox9 in DR by applying single cell multi-omics to BEC-
specific Sox9 knockout mouse models. The data generated in this project will provide fundamental mechanistic
insight into genetic regulation of DR and identify regulatory nodes for therapeutic targeting to enhance
regeneration in end stage liver disease."
10767969,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pregnancy is a unique period in which the inherent biological complexity of any single human organism is
exponentially amplified by an intimate interaction between a rapidly developing fetus and an adult mother who
exhibits remarkable physiological adaptations over the nine months of pregnancy. Importantly, the biological
interests of the two organisms are not always congruent, reflecting conflicting metabolic interests and limited
supplies. Furthermore, maternal-fetal interaction does not occur through a passive sieve, but is actively and
dynamically orchestrated by the placenta, an organ with its own set of physiological needs. It is therefore
apparent that any disruption of the homeostatic equilibrium among the mother, placenta, fetus or their
environment may manifest as a clinical disease that challenges maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) or
fetal development (e.g., fetal growth restriction), or may lead to premature termination of the pregnancy (e.g.,
preterm birth). The intact function of the placenta includes a set of signals that are generated by placental
trophoblasts and communicated to the maternal and/or the fetal compartments. These signals include
hormones (proteins, glycoproteins, steroid hormones) and growth factors, which have a paracrine and
endocrine effect on maternal and, possibly, fetal tissues. Our new line of research centers on nanovesicle
(exosome)-based communication. These exosomes are produced in human trophoblasts and harbor signals
that are germane to pregnancy health. Among these signals are placenta-specific microRNAs (miRNAs) that,
we recently showed, confer viral resistance to recipient cells. These miRNAs may also impact local placental
biological processes, such as trophoblast migration and invasion. While the placenta produces an abundant
number of exosomes, their target tissues are currently unknown. Moreover, the mechanisms by which
placental exosomes deliver their cargo to target cells and the regulation of their intracellular function have not
been hitherto investigated. We therefore seek to test the hypothesis that human trophoblastic exosomes use
specific uptake mechanisms to target maternal tissues, locally and distantly, and impact cell function. We will
test our hypothesis using human trophoblasts and exosomes derived from pregnant women. For those
experiments that cannot be performed in humans, we will use mice that have been validated as appropriately
modeling the human processes under study. Ultimately, our data will illuminate previously unknown
mechanisms of crucial, exosome-based communication between the feto-placental and maternal
compartments. Further, as placental exosomes are accessible via the blood, data generated by our
investigation will introduce new means to investigate the human placenta, and may promote the use of
exosomes as part of the diagnostics of placental dysfunction and indicate new avenues for nanoparticle-based
therapeutics."
10767908,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Access to mental health specialists is limited for many patients in the U.S., particularly for those who live in
rural or other underserved communities. Telemental health is one potential solution for this access problem.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, use of telemental health was growing in rural communities, but overall use
was still low. During the public health emergency (PHE), use of telemental health increased dramatically across
the U.S., and telemedicine currently accounts for the majority of mental health visits. Now that most clinicians
and patients in treatment have tried telemental health, it is unclear how they will choose to incorporate this
technology into clinical care after the PHE ends. In this renewal we seek to understand the future role of
telemental health in mental health treatment and its relationship to access, equity, and quality of care.
In the first four years of our mixed-method R01, we made substantial progress in understanding how
telemental health is being used in real-world settings. We described its growth, how use varied substantially
across communities, and whether it had reduced urban-rural disparities in care pre-COVID-19. In the last year,
we pivoted to understanding the role that telemental health has played during the PHE and we worked directly
with health plans, state government, and the federal government to inform policy decisions. Building off this
foundation, we seek a renewal of our RO1 to understand how use of telemental health changes mental health
practice after the PHE ends and the association of these new practice models and quality of care. Under the
first aim, we seek to inform ongoing policy debates on reimbursement, licensure, and regulations by measuring
differences in telemental health use in response to post-PHE changes in regulation and reimbursement. There
has been considerable debate on whether telemental health will increase or decrease disparities in care. In the
second aim, using both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we will assess the role of telemental health in care
for disadvantaged populations and what is being done to address disparities. Under the third aim, we will
explore how telemedicine has changed how clinicians treat major depression and bipolar-I disorder, illnesses
representing different (on average) severity and chronicity, and, in the fourth aim, whether different telemental
health patterns are associated with improved or worse outcomes. We will use a mixed methods approach that
incorporates into each aim both quantitative analyses of Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurance claims
data and qualitative interviews (either of providers or patients).
Understanding how telemental health is incorporated into mental health treatment after the PHE, whether its
use worsens or narrows existing disparities in care, the role of regulation and reimbursement in telemental
health use, and whether different patterns of use are associated with higher quality care will help influence the
ongoing policy debate on telemental health. Together the results of these aims are consistent with the NIMH’s
expressed interest in innovative delivery models that can improve care for underserved communities."

Our Plan to Enhance Diversity is a strategy to attract people underrepresented in science and medicine
(URSM) to the Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) with a long-range goal of equitable engagement of URSM
populations in the Center. This work engages MCC Leadership, membership, staff, and stakeholders to
continuously work on inclusion and to address equity in our structures, systems, environment, and actions. To
have the people in our Center mirror the populations of Minnesota, our catchment area, and the nation, we
have the following Specific Aims: 1) Prioritize MCC Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) strategies within MCC
and supporting institutions; 2) Strengthen cancer career entry pathways for URSM staff, trainees, and
postdocs; and 3) Advance URSM faculty careers and leadership development.
To achieve these aims, we will integrate DEI strategies across MCC, in part through convening a DEI internal
advisory board to focus on development, support, and integration for DEI actions across the Center. DEI
outcomes and impacts will be evaluated with benchmarks, metrics, and dashboards focused on diverse
recruitment, retention, and representation; inclusive environment metrics; and equity measures. University-
wide resources, including the University of Minnesota Office of Equity and Diversity, and cancer-specific
initiatives will be leveraged to create an inclusive environment. Career development will be supported though
internal and external relationships and access to training programs and information on career opportunities,
which will help to retain URSM faculty. Administrative support and work to mitigate recruitment and hiring bias
will aid in recruiting additional USRM hires. Leadership opportunities will be expanded through mentoring,
shadowing, and leadership development efforts in MCC, as well as in the Medical School and across the
University of Minnesota community.
The Plan to Enhance Diversity is led by Dr. Rahel Ghebre (Screening, Prevention, Etiology, and Cancer
Survivorship Program), a gynecologic oncologist; Professor in the UMN Medical School; and a senior leader
within the institution for DEI, gender equity, and faculty development. She has expertise in global oncology

The research goals of the Carcinogenesis and Chemoprevention (CC) Program are to identify the chemical
and molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis in order to develop strategies to prevent cancer and to affect
public policy to reduce carcinogen exposure. These goals encompass major Specific Aims that have significant
synergy: 1) Characterize the harmful effects of tobacco chemicals and products and develop biomarkers for
cancer risk stratification in clinical and epidemiological studies; 2) Understand the landscape of exposures and
biochemical pathways leading to cancer to identify tools for cancer susceptibility assessment, prevention, and
treatment; and 3) Identify food products, as well as natural and synthetic chemicals, that reduce cancer risk.
The CC Program is led by Lisa Peterson, PhD, and Frank Ondrey, MD, PhD, FACS, who have complementary
experience that provides strong and synergistic leadership, and has 22 members from 15 departments across
8 colleges, schools, and institutes at the University of Minnesota. The CC Program is highly productive, as
evidenced by the number (523) of intra- (21%) and interprogrammatic (28%) as well as interinstitutional (70%)
publications and cancer-relevant grant funding ($7.2M). A crosscutting theme of the Program is biomarker
development to generate tools to identify at-risk individuals and support targeted prevention or therapeutic
approaches. Furthermore, the Program’s research tackles all the cancers with elevated risk in Minnesota such
as melanoma, breast, corpus uteri, blood (leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma), and bladder cancer as well
as other cancers highly prevalent in the state. The Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) provides many benefits to
the CC Program including Shared Resources (particularly Analytical Biochemistry, Biostatistics, Cancer
Genomics, and Comparative Pathology); pilot funding; and funds for retreats, seminars, conferences, and
other meetings. Translation of our basic research findings has been facilitated by active involvement of
Program members in 8 Translational Working Groups. All of these activities have helped enhance the
interactions among Program members as well as with individuals from other Programs and institutions. The
future directions and goals of the Program fit well within all 4 pillars of MCC’s Strategic Plan. Recently obtained
funding engages the Minnesota community and care providers with the goal of accelerating the path to cancer
prevention and cures, particularly for lung, head and neck, blood and prostate cancers. In addition, we will
build on the success of the 10,000 Family Study by partnering with members of the SPECS Program and
Community Outreach and Engagement to expand our work linking environmental exposures to cancers of
concern to Minnesotans."
10768146,"Cellular Mechanisms Program Summary
The Cellular Mechanisms (CM) Program focuses on defining the key signaling and transcriptional mechanisms
that drive tumor progression, both within tumor cells and in the tumor microenvironment, and developing new
therapeutic approaches to target these mechanisms. The goal of the CM Program is to integrate the
information gained from our synergistic research areas to identify novel tumor and host-cell mechanisms that
can be exploited to define new biomarkers or to limit disease progression and metastasis. The CM Research
Program is structured around 3 well-integrated Aims: 1) Identify biomarkers of early disease and oncogenic
signaling pathways that can be targeted to limit tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis; 2) Define,
characterize, and regulate transcriptional programs that enhance malignancy or resistance to therapy; and 3)
Determine how tumor–stromal interactions impact tumor progression, invasion, migration, and metastasis, and
develop host-based therapies that target oncogenic signaling pathways in tumor cells.
The CM Program is co-led by Daniel Harki, PhD, an expert in medicinal chemistry and drug development, and
Kaylee Schwertfeger, PhD, an expert in tumor cell signaling and mechanisms of tumor–stromal interactions.
CM’s 50 members, representing 18 departments and 7 schools or colleges, are highly collaborative, are
leaders in their fields, and include several scholars with both clinical and laboratory expertise. In 2022, they
were supported by $20.8M in cancer-relevant research funding, of which $8.8M was from the NCI. Since 2018,
Program members have published 642 papers, 12% of which resulted from intraprogrammatic collaborations,
32% from interprogrammatic collaborations, and 67% from external collaborations. To move their research
from the bench to the clinic, they participate in several Translational Working Groups and lead interventional
clinical trials evaluating new targeted therapies and observational clinical trials to diagnose tumors using novel
molecular and imaging technologies.
The Masonic Cancer Center has provided substantial value to the program, including access to Shared
Resources, funding of pilot projects that were effectively leveraged into larger external grants, engagement
with clinicians through the Translational Working Groups, and support from the Cancer Research Translational
Initiative to move CM basic and translational research to the clinic."
10769043,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (TRAINING & DISSEMINATION)
Magnetic resonance (MR) techniques have become indispensable in studies of organ function in health and
disease, using advanced instrumentation, complex auxiliary capabilities, such as large-scale data and image
processing, and complementary measurements employing other techniques (e.g., electrophysiology) and/or
other imaging modalities such as single and multiphoton imaging. The optimal use of these techniques, however,
requires access to new methods that enable new measurement capabilities (such as new MR pulse sequences)
and require extensive training. The general aim of this Training and Dissemination component of this P41
National Center for Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NCBIB) is to educate scientists in the technologies
we develop in the NCBIB and disseminate the many products and information that will result from the activities
of the Technology Research and Development projects. The training activities will focus on continuing education
and advanced training in high and ultrahigh field MR imaging and spectroscopy methods, UHF instrumentation,
and multimodal imaging for biomedical research and clinical use. The goal is to catalyze broad application of
NCBIB tools and skill sets by a national community of basic, translational, and clinical investigators thereby
increasing the Center’s impact. This goal will be accomplished through workshops, hands-on training courses,

10769209,"The lung is a major determinant of human health and respiratory diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality among the elderly. The elderly population is one of the fastest-growing demographics in the US and
worldwide. Our innovative T32 program in Biology of Aging and Pulmonary Diseases addresses a critical need
to train biomedical researchers, physician scientists and future leaders in the links between aging and lung
disease. We propose a multidisciplinary training program that will integrate basic mechanistic investigation of
pulmonary disease and the biology of aging, with translational and clinical investigation of acute and chronic lung
disease. The Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine (PCCS) at The Ohio State University has
been in a growth phase with the influx of investigators with well-recognized research programs and established
track records of training. This new training program will be co-directed by Ana L Mora, MD, the Associate Director
of research in the Davis Heart and Lung Research Institute and Rama Mallampalli, MD, the Chair of the
Department of Internal Medicine (DOIM). An Executive Committee comprised of Jeffrey Horowitz, MD, Division
Director of PCCS, and Mauricio Rojas, MD, Associate Vice-Chair of Research in the DOIM will support Drs. Mora
and Mallampalli in the administration of the training program. Five total positions will be available for MD and
PhD scientists, with a 3-year structured, milestone-driven curriculum based primarily in laboratory research and

10770364,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The mission of the IMSD@U2 program is to build a diverse biomedical workforce reflective of our general
population. In the past four years (2017-2020), the University of Utah’s commitment to diversity and inclusion
has resulted in successful recruitment of Underrepresented (UR) students to the Biosciences PhD programs, so
that UR students comprise 32% (49 UR/153 total) of the matriculated students. However, we recognize that
these substantial gains in the diversity of our incoming PhD classes over the last four years might fail to produce
the longer-term objectives of expanding diversity in the biomedical workforce, without effective, sustained and
comprehensive inclusion efforts that fortify scientific career development for UR students. The aims of the
IMSD@U2 are to train and launch the careers of diverse, creative, and talented underrepresented (UR) students
by 1) continuing to build our successful recruitment program for UR students to our University of Utah Bioscience
PhD programs; 2) developing and utilizing innovative programs to retain UR students through our ExCEEDS
(Excellence in Career Enhancement, Education, Development and Diversity in Science) framework, thereby
launching our UR trainees into successful careers; 3) preparing IMSD@U2 trainees to become confident leaders
in biomedical research; and 4) mentoring faculty mentors, thus developing and fostering a research-intensive
and inclusive environment in which UR trainees and scientists can flourish.
In order to accomplish these goals, key proposed activities that augment the current program include:
personalized and cohort mentoring, peer outreach efforts and community building, a dynamic onboarding
experience to support a successful start to graduate school, leadership development, faculty mentoring and
development to better meet the needs of the UR community. Ultimately, we intend for our trainees to complete
their qualifying exams, publish original research, apply for and obtain fellowships, complete their PhDs (70%
success rate) with a mean time to degree of 6 years, and advance to high-quality postdoctoral and career
positions in science-intensive and science-related careers in academia, industry, and government."
10770493,"Mechanisms of pancreatic cancer initiation and progression from normal human pancreatic tissue
 For the past thirty years, the survival rate for many cancers has improved, but survival for pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has not, due to lack of both early detection methods and effective treatments.
Genetically modified mouse models have been widely used to study PDAC pathogenesis. However, mouse
cancer models may overlook some profound differences between human and mouse cells. To understand the
mechanisms of human PDAC tumorigenesis, we have established a novel system to isolate and genetically
manipulate primary acinar cells and ductal cells from normal human pancreatic tissue. This unique system
provides us with the opportunity to study the earliest changes in acinar or ductal cells during human PDAC
initiation. Pancreatitis-induced acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM) is considered to be the earliest change during
PDAC development. Using our system, we recapitulated acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM) in vitro at the
single-cell level, and identified that the TGFβ signaling pathway induces ADM in human acinar cells, partially
through SMAD4-mediated pathway. During ADM, cells gained new characteristic properties, including transient
proliferative capacity. However, the underlying mechanisms facilitating these changes remain unclear. We will
use our system to further investigate the ADM process. KRAS is the earliest and most frequently mutated
oncogene in pancreatic cancer. However, the mechanism by which oncogenic KRAS initiates neoplasia is not
well understood, and it is generally accepted that additional genetic/epigenetic alterations are required to
cooperate with KRAS mutation to initiate PDAC development. We found that mutant KRAS can extend the
proliferation of AD cells (acinar cells that have undergone ADM). We hypothesize that ADM-associated
changes cooperate with oncogenic KRAS to initiate pancreatic cancer. Although the SMAD4 pathway is
required for ADM, this gene is frequently mutated in the late-stage PDAC samples, suggesting that it may have
distinct functions under different cellular contexts. Interestingly, mouse PDAC models with SMAD4 deletion
developed intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) rather than pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia
(PanIN). Whether this result is due to differences between mice and humans or due to the different cell
lineages from which the tumors developed remains to be discovered. The findings from the proposed
investigations will reveal human-specific aspects of PDAC tumorigenesis. The outcomes of these studies will
not only provide an opportunity to discover prognostic markers but also give us insight into PDAC
tumorigenesis that may lead to development of new methods for cancer treatment."
10770494,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Even at the earliest cortical stages, visual processing is influenced by internally generated information. Top-
down influence on visual processing is found in very different behavioral contexts. As a result, early visual areas
are increasingly considered as “interfaces” or “blackboards” where bottom-up information is confronted to top-
down representations. Yet, our knowledge on the cellular and network mechanisms by which top-down signals
modulate the integrative properties of visual cortical neurons is still fragmentary. Moreover, the impact on visual
processing and visual perception of the relatively small top-down modulations that were described in early visual
cortices is debated. Finally, we ignore to what extent top-down modulation is flexible and can be adapted to a
novel behavioral goal. Our long-term goal is to better understand the functions and mechanisms of top-down
influences on early visual processing using a recent and tractable model: the modulation by sound of visual
processing in V1. We have recently shown that the representation of the orientation and direction of the visual
stimulus in V1 is improved in the audiovisual context, through a potentiation of the response of neurons with
preferred orientations matching the orientation of the visual cue, and a suppression of the activity of neurons
coding for orthogonal orientations and opposite directions. The overall objective of this application is to establish
the cellular and network mechanisms, functional impact and flexibility of sound modulation on early visual pro-
cessing. Our central hypotheses, based on our preliminary data, is that sound modulation in V1 results from the
activation of local mechanisms controlling the orientation and direction tuning of V1 neurons, that modest im-
provements of the representation of visual stimuli can improve visual perception, and that sound modulation in
V1 is flexible and can be adapted to novel behavioral goals by training. The rationale for the proposed research
is to better understand why, when and how internal representations bias sensory perception. To test our central
hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the cellular mechanisms underpinning the
orientation and direction-dependent sound modulation of V1 neurons by performing whole-cell recordings in
awake mice, a technique for which our laboratory has a unique expertise; Using two-photon calcium imaging in
mice performing Go/NoGo behavioral tasks, we will also 2) Determine the impact of sound modulation on the
representation of the visual stimulus in V1 and on visual perception; 3) Demonstrate that sound modulation is
flexible and can be adapted to a novel behavioral task though training. Our approach is innovative because we
will bring to the mouse a topic so far mostly addressed in primates to benefit from functional imaging, genetic
tools and our unique skill at performing whole-cell recordings in awake behaving mice. The proposed research
is significant because it is expected to vertically advance our understanding on how top-down inputs adapt visual
processing to the behavioral goal. Ultimately, such a knowledge will inform the pathophysiology of several de-
velopmental, and degenerative disorders in which top-down control of sensory processing is impaired."
10770511,"Project Summary/Abstract
The past decade has seen outstanding advances in the genetics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most of
this progress has occurred by the study of rare genetic variation, especially de novo variation, with the Autism
Sequencing Consortium (ASC) playing a central role. The ASC represents a coordinated international effort to
identify ASD risk genes. In our most recent, unpublished, analyses of 72,410 individuals from ASD families, we
identified 185 genes associated with risk (FDR < 0.05). Some of these genes have been linked to a broad array
of developmental disorders, while others have not. Based on these results, we posit that some risk genes alter
the core features of ASD, while creating fewer perturbations to other features of development: discovery of such
genes will provide deeper insights into pathways disrupted in ASD. We will build on this progress by analysis of
sequence data from three resources: ASD subjects and families; subjects with other developmental and neuro-
psychiatric disorders; and subjects from population samples. We plan new research focusing on interpretation
of rare variation, including single nucleotide variation (SNV), indels, and copy number variation (CNV). Our key
targets are inherited variants, including X-linked inherited variants, which to date have shown very little signal,
and missense variants, for which signal has been confined to highly conserved substitutions. We anticipate
doubling the number of ASD genes discovered, ~ 400, by increasing the number of families analyzed and by
refined methods to interpret inherited and missense variation. And, in parallel, we expect to resolve critical as-
pects of ASD genetic architecture and to unveil key aspects of what makes ASD and its core features – social
deficits and restrictive and repetitive behaviors – different from other neurodevelopmental disorders. To discover
ASD risk genes with a distinct effect on ASD, we have the following specific aims: 1) To amalgamate existing
and emerging whole exome and whole genome sequence data; 2) To develop new analytical methods and
analyze the accumulated sequence data; and, 3) To contrast ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorder risk
genes, examining developmental profiles, cell types implicated, and whether variants in the same gene differ in
how they affect risk for ASD and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. With this new research
we will accelerate our overall objective, which is the identification of ASD genes, thereby facilitating our long-
term goal of building the foundation from which therapeutic targets for ASD emerge. Our rationale is that the
identification of genes conferring significant risk to ASD and associated neurodevelopmental disorders can form
the basis of studies to understand pathogenesis, as well as the basis for novel therapies. Our central hypothesis
– formulated based on results over the past decade – is that rare and common variation contributes additively to
risk for ASD, but only certain rare variants confer substantial risk. The research proposed is innovative, in our
opinion, because it uses groundbreaking and novel statistical methods for identifying risk variants for ASD."

Training physicians and Ph.D. scientists can deliver impactful translational-based research in lung diseases
and bridge the knowledge gap in common respiratory ailments. This application aims to train a new generation
of scientists at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) to increase basic and translational research in respiratory
diseases. The BCM-Respiratory Research Training (RRT) T32 program will offer scientists training
opportunities with a multidisciplinary approach using hypothesis-driven research in lung diseases. The BCM-
RRT T32 program will provide training opportunities for three candidates each year from a local and national
pool of highly qualified Ph.D., MD, and MD/Ph.D. postdoctoral trainees. A balanced alliance of MD and Ph.D.
trainees will promote the interchange of diverse ideas, broadening, and delivering new discoveries in lung
research. The BCM-RRT T32 program will emphasize the five foci of respiratory research training in
respiratory diseases that are aligned with the NHLBI priorities, and unmet clinical needs including 1)
Obstructive and Destructive Lung Diseases; 2) Fibrotic Lung Diseases; 3) Lung Infection; 4) Epidemiology of
Lung Diseases; and 5) Genomic and Bioinformatics Research. The Faculty Mentors (7 MDs, 3 MD/Ph.D., and
7 PhDs) represent a multidisciplinary group of experienced investigators from various departments at BCM,
with well-funded laboratories that broadly cover basic, and translational programs in lung diseases. Faculty
Mentors have outstanding mentoring portfolios and excellent track records of participation in training program
activities. Drs. Kheradmand and Rosas will serve as Program Co-Directors, are nationally and internationally
recognized clinician-scientists, and have been successful in training scientists to pursue federally funded
research in respiratory diseases. They are joined by a strong team of Steering Committee members (Drs.
King, Hanania, Pereira, and Rodriguez) to coordinate the recruitment and selection of candidates, oversee
the curriculum, and will be responsible for the evaluation of the mentoring team. Trainees will be guided to
assemble individual research Mentoring Committees, prepare a written research proposal, and hold Advisory
Committee reviews every six-month that include academic and career assessments. The BCM-RRT T32
program will prepare trainees for successful biomedical careers in respiratory research which will be facilitated
through the Mentoring Committee’s hands-on guidance throughout the training period. These include ensuring
that the trainees engage in impactful research and obtain local, extramural, and/or national funding, to
advance their future careers. A thorough needs assessment for incoming BCM-RRT T32 program trainees

oral presentation, time management, and academic goals. Securing research grants will be a priority included
in a comprehensive plan to prepare trainees as independent lung-focused research scientists."
10783773,"Project Summary
Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a complex psychiatric disorder with large societal and personal strain, involving
many brain regions and cell types. Few effective treatments exist that specifically target the prevention of binge
drinking. Understanding the underlying neurobiology of binge drinking is essential for preventing and treating
this major public health problem. Ongoing work in our lab seeks to understand how somatostatin (SST)
expressing GABAergic neurons in the prelimbic (PL) cortex, which have long been implicated in other
neuropsychiatric disorders as an anti-depressive, resilience-conferring population of peptidergic neurons, may
function as a therapeutic target for AUD. The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand how
SST peptide signaling contributes to PL circuitry function, and how these pathways are
modulated by binge alcohol consumption. Using a combination of electrophysiology, circuit mapping,
fiber photometry, and behavior, we will explore three complementary but non-overlapping aims: we will
demonstrate how SST modulates prelimbic pyramidal neurons, the specific outputs modulated by SST, and the
overall behavioral phenotype of SST administration to the PL cortex. We will conduct these experiments during
control conditions and in the context of binge drinking.
Taken together, these experiments will determine the overall role of SST peptide effects on pathway-specific
circuits of the PL cortex. In addition, we will establish the in vivo effects of SST peptide on alcohol consumption
and anxiety-like behaviors, providing an overall mechanistic and functional characterization of SST in the PL
cortex. These results will build upon our previous findings to elucidate the precise role of the SST peptide.
Importantly, we expect these results to have the potential to inform new treatment targets for AUD."
10783809,"ABSTRACT
In this project, we will investigate the dynamics of inhibition in the ventral tegmental area (VTA)
during chronic stress. GABAergic neurons make up 35% of neurons in the VTA, but relatively little is
known about them. These cells are critical regulators of neighboring dopaminergic neurons, and are
robustly activated by acute stress. VTA GABA neurons are thus poised to be a significant mediator of
stress’s effects on the VTA. It remains unknown, however, how these neurons respond to chronic
stress. In this proposal, we will take a multidisciplinary approach, utilizing electrophysiology,
optogenetics, behavior, and fiber photometry to address the hypothesis that chronic stress leads to
persistent hyperactivity of VTA GABA neurons and that this underlies the emergence of maladaptive
behavioral responses. In the first aim, we will examine the dynamics of inhibition of VTA dopamine
neurons by VTA GABA neurons during stress. In the second, we will investigate how activity of and
strength of synaptic inputs onto VTA GABA neurons changes during stress. In the third aim, we will
examine whether in vivo activity of VTA GABA neurons contributes to individual differences in the
emergence of social anhedonia post-stress. These studies hold the potential to contribute significantly
to our understanding of how the reward system is altered by stress and may lead to novel avenues
for the development of therapeutic treatments for depression and other stress-linked disorders."
10783774,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Rhinovirus (RV) is the predominant cause of the common cold, a major contributor to virus-induced
exacerbations of asthma, and infants who wheeze with RV infections are at increased risk for developing asthma.
Of the three RV species (A, B and C), RV-C is a major contributor to wheezing illnesses and exacerbations of
asthma in young children. In contrast to serologically characterized RV-A and B, current classification of RV-C
is based solely on sequence identity in the VP1 region and whether these genotypes correspond to unique
serotypes is unknown. Children with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs6967330) in CDHR3 gene,
encoding the cellular receptor for RV-C, are at greatest risk for RV-C infections and illnesses. This coding SNP
is also a risk factor for early onset childhood asthma. There are no specific antivirals or vaccines for treatment
and prevention of RV-C induced illnesses but vaccination to prevent RV infections (and particularly RV-C in
young children with the CDHR3 SNP) could have major public health impact. Our recent studies in animal models
have demonstrated the feasibility of polyvalent inactivated RV vaccine antigens. New discoveries related to RV-
C structure, naturally-acquired immunity and human monoclonal antibody production will help us to fill existing
knowledge gaps and develop RV-C vaccine approaches suitable for clinical trials. Little is known about the
mechanisms of neutralizing antibody responses to RV-C. Neutralizing epitopes for RV-A and RV-B were mapped
to the most prominent surface protrusions of capsid proteins. Interestingly, the first cryo-EM atomic structure of
RV-C revealed unique, protruding “finger-like” spikes, formed by VP1, predicted to be dominant immunogenic
epitopes. We will test for type-specific and cross-reactive epitopes in these capsid structures. Another recent
discovery is that humoral immunity to RV-C (compared to other RVs) is more rapidly acquired with age. We
hypothesize that infections with RV-C can induce stronger, more cross-reactive neutralizing antibody responses
of longer duration compared to RV-A, due to (i) their ability to induce more severe illnesses in young children,
and (ii) some key structural and/or functional differences in major neutralizing immunogenic epitopes. To test
this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims: 1) to identify host and viral determinants of neutralizing antibody
responses combining the RV typing data from multiple cohort studies (n=14) and analysis of titers, time of
appearance and duration of these antibody responses in the COAST children; 2) to determine whether RV-C
genotypes represent unique serotypes or share common epitopes; 3) using human monoclonal antibodies
complexed with RV-C, map major immunogenic epitopes and determine the mechanisms of RV-C antibody
neutralization and cross-neutralization by cryo-EM. These studies will inform the development of a broadly
protective RV-C vaccine that could be of significant benefit to young children at increased risk for RV-C induced
lower respiratory tract infections."
10783782,"Significant gaps remain in our understanding of the neurobiological, mechanistic bases of stuttering.
Accumulating evidence points to the possible role of basal ganglia-thalamocortical (BGTC) and cerebellar (CE)
networks in stuttering persistence and recovery. To date there have been few attempts to examine how BGTC
and CE network structure and function relate to behavioral differences in intrinsic timing of speech and
nonspeech gestures, and how these processes link to stuttering persistence and recovery. The long-term goal
is to leverage and significantly expand our current large-scale investigation of childhood stuttering to more fully
characterize the neural network-based brain mechanisms that underlie developmental stuttering. The overall
objective of this application is to examine connectivity of BG and CE networks in children and adolescents who
stutter relevant to auditory, motor, and sensorimotor timing. The central hypothesis is that deficient intrinsic timing
ability underlies persistent stuttering, which is reflected in BGTC and CE network connectivity patterns. The
rationale for the proposed project is that a better understanding of how maturational patterns of cortical-
subcortical networks supporting temporal processing differ in children who stutter should lead to a clearer
account of the mechanisms underlying persistence and recovery of stuttering. We plan to test our central
hypothesis and, thereby, accomplish our overall objective for this project by pursuing the following specific aims:
1. Examine detailed brain functional and structural connectivity differences along the BGTC and CE networks
associated with stuttering persistence and recovery; 2. Examine performance differences on rhythm perception
and production tasks as they relate to stuttering persistence and recovery; 3. Establish a comprehensive,
developmental dataset up to adolescence that elucidates BG and CE network connectivity and multifactorial
influences associated with stuttering persistence and recovery. Under aim 1, we will apply advanced fMRI and
DTI acquisition protocols used by a multi-site developmental neuroimaging consortium (i.e., ABCD) to compare
functional and structural connectivity changes in the BGTC and CE networks in children and adolescents who
stutter. Under aim 2, we will examine the links between cortical-subcortical network connectivity and performance
on temporal processing tasks that tax intrinsic timing abilities. Under aim 3, we will significantly expand our
investigations of childhood stuttering into the understudied and dynamic period of adolescence by leveraging a
large developmental dataset through the ABCD consortium. This approach is innovative, because it will be the
first to provide a detailed account of subcortical connectivities relevant to aberrant temporal processing function
in stuttering. The proposed research is significant, because it will lead to mechanistic insights into trait versus
compensatory neural network development associated with persistence and recovery of stuttering. Ultimately,
such knowledge has the potential to inform the development of better prognostic tools and interventions for
stuttering during childhood."
10783813,"Elevated blood pressure (BP) and hypertension are rampant in the US, disproportionately affecting over half of
black adults. Interventions that lower BP reduce risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, and premature
death. The DASH diet, a balanced eating plan that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low fat dairy, and lean meats,
is efficacious in lowering BP among black adults with hypertension. However, uptake among black adults is poor.
In fact, unhealthy diet is the most significant determinant of disparities in hypertension management among black
adults. Despite numerous educational initiatives encouraging adults to eat 7-9 daily servings of fruits and
vegetables, average consumption of fruits and vegetables by adults of lower socioeconomic status has stagnated
at 1.3 servings daily. Access, cost, and cultural dissonance in urban ""food deserts"" have been cited as significant
barriers to healthier eating. Thus, innovative research is urgently needed to devise strategies that improve
consumption of healthy foods and reduce health disparities among black adults living in urban food deserts.
Novel innovations in grocery delivery have the potential to overcome barriers to healthy eating on a massive
scale. With the advent of large technology-based companies, which have unprecedented sourcing and delivery
capabilities, it is possible to overcome traditional barriers and facilitate choice of palatable healthy foods
throughout urban black communities. However, whether virtual supermarkets with home delivery can be
leveraged to meaningfully improve diet and BP in an urban food desert has never been tested.
We will perform a 12-week individual-level, randomized trial to determine the health effects of complete dietary
replacement with home-delivered, low-sodium, DASH-pattern groceries ordered virtually with dietitian
assistance. Our proposal represents a partnership with community clinics serving urban communities in
consultation with leaders in culturally sensitive meal preparation and community-based participatory research to
enroll black adults living in local urban food deserts with elevated BP or hypertension. Participants will have
autonomy to choose their own groceries weekly through AmazonFresh, following a pattern that portions food
groups according to the DASH feeding plan at an amount that exceeds their Calorie needs. After 12 weeks, we
will assess the effects of the groceries on systolic BP (primary outcome) and secondarily on CVD risk factors
(cholesterol). Our proposal also includes 8 weeks of dedicated observation to characterize facilitators and
barriers of sustained DASH adherence via mixed methods.
This trial will establish a scalable, patient-oriented solution that overcomes poor access to healthful foods and
addresses health disparities. Knowledge to be gained from this proposal is directly relevant to evolving U.S. food
stamp (SNAP) policy toward e-commence groceries and will inform iterative innovation on interventions that
reduce dietary disparities among black adults. Ultimately, our proposal accomplishes a major strategic priority of
the NIMHD for scientific research to “develop and test interventions to reduce health disparities.”"
10783818,"Abstract
Increasing evidence indicates that clinical responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in solid tumors are
mediated by T-cell recognition of “neoantigens” created when peptides containing amino acids altered by
cancer specific mutations are presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. Thus, strategies
to augment such T-cell responses independent of, or concurrent with ICB, could be of therapeutic benefit. Prior
work on neoantigen-reactive T cells has focused on CD8+ T cells which directly recognize antigens presented
on class I MHC expressed by tumor cells. However, there is emerging evidence that CD4+ T cell responses
directed against neoantigens presented by class II MHC on professional antigen presenting cells (APC) are
common, contribute to tumor rejection in mouse models, and are effective in cancer patients treated with
adoptively transferred tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. I recently discovered CD4+ T-cells specific for recurrent
driver mutations in BRAF, KRAS, Her2 and EGFR in cancer patients, and have cloned the specific T cell
receptors (TCRs) to use for adoptive immunotherapy of patients that express these mutations and have the
correct MHC alleles. Driver mutations make ideal immunotherapy targets because, unlike most neoantigens
that are random and patient specific, they are positively selected for clonal and homogenous expression and
are found in multiple patients. We and others have shown that driver mutation-specific CD4+ T cell responses
are commonly present, and that these T cells can be expanded locally in tumors, suggesting they recognize
tumor antigens in vivo. In mouse models, tumor antigen-specific CD4+ T cells can mediate tumor rejection
through direct destruction of tumor cells, activation of innate immune cells, and stimulation of CD8+ T cell
responses, but the mechanisms of action by CD4+ T cells in human antitumor immunity are largely unknown.
High dimensional single cell analysis of human tumors has shown heterogeneity of CD4+ T cells with regards
to activation, exhaustion, cytolytic potential, and differentiation states associated with stimulation versus
suppression of cellular immune responses, but which of these populations contain the small subset of
neoantigen specific CD4+ T cells is unknown. In specific aim 1 we will address the frequency, activation, and
differentiation state of neoantigen specific CD4+ T cells in tumors to better understand whether and how these
cells might contribute to antitumor immunity. We will then use our discovery of a TCR that can redirect the
specificity of CD4+ T cell to the common BRAF V600E mutation to ask whether adoptive cell transfer of
neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells can be safe in a first in human phase I clinical trial in specific aim 2. This
trial will give the opportunity for asking whether adoptively transferred CD4+ T cells can mediate therapeutic
effects and address potential mechanisms for CD4+ T cells to mediate antitumor immunity. If successful, this
approach could be applied to additional targets in larger number of patients."

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risks of developing cardiovascular disease,
progressing to end stage renal disease, and dying prematurely. Translation of scientific breakthroughs into
clinical trials is limited by our ability to identify the right study population. By assessing the degree of interstitial
fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), global glomerulosclerosis (GS), and microvascular disease (MVD), kidney
histopathology informs risk of CKD progression, independent of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and
proteinuria. Prior studies implicate decreased renal microvascular perfusion and resultant chronic hypoxia in
the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis. Since kidney biopsy carries risks, investigation of a novel imaging biomarker
of renal microvascular perfusion may provide a non-invasive tool to identify a high-risk CKD phenotype. By
assessing the motion of intravascular microbubble contrast agents, contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) may
detect renal microvascular perfusion. In exciting preliminary data, Dr. Srivastava found a low microbubble
wash-in rate, suggestive of low renal microvascular perfusion, in patients with advanced CKD and with severe
chronic histopathologic lesions. In the proposed studies, he will comprehensively evaluate the microbubble
wash-in rate in health and disease. In Aim 1, he will test the association of the microbubble wash-in rate with
gold standard assessments of renal blood flow and function, measured by para-aminohippurate and iohexol
clearances, respectively. In Aim 2, he will use the microbubble wash-in rate to differentiate patients with CKD
from healthy volunteers. In Aim 3, he will test the association of the microbubble wash-in rate with MVD, IFTA,
GS, and change in eGFR over time in individuals undergoing a native kidney biopsy. The results will inform the
field of novel non-invasive imaging biomarkers in CKD. Complementary to the highly clinically relevant studies,
Dr. Srivastava will implement a strategically focused career development plan 1) to acquire skills in image data
analysis and development of imaging biomarkers, 2) to incorporate imaging biomarkers into patient oriented
research studies, 3) to learn methods to perform imaging biomarker validation, 4) to develop scientific
management skills and build collaborations with biomarker and imaging experts, and 5) to increase research
portfolio and improve grantsmanship skills. To accomplish these goals, Dr. Srivastava assembled a multi-
disciplinary mentoring team of experts in patient oriented research and clinical trials in CKD (Primary mentor,
Dr. Tamara Isakova), CEUS (Co-mentor, Dr. Thomas Grant), biomarker development and validation (Dr.
Sushrut Waikar), CEUS image analysis (Dr. Jason Streeter), flow imaging (Dr. Michael Markl), and patient
oriented research with imaging endpoints (Dr. James Carr). Execution of the proposed studies, acquisition of
the training goals, and outstanding mentorship in a robust scientific environment at Northwestern University will
position Dr. Srivastava to transition to an independent investigator with unique expertise in use of novel non-
invasive imaging biomarkers in patient oriented research studies and clinical trials in patients with CKD."

field of novel non-invasive imaging biomarkers in CKD. Complementary to the highly clinically relevant studies,
Dr. Srivastava will implement a strategically focused career development plan 1) to acquire skills in image data
analysis and development of imaging biomarkers, 2) to incorporate imaging biomarkers into patient oriented
research studies, 3) to learn methods to perform imaging biomarker validation, 4) to develop scientific
management skills and build collaborations with biomarker and imaging experts, and 5) to increase research
portfolio and improve grantsmanship skills. To accomplish these goals, Dr. Srivastava assembled a multi-
disciplinary mentoring team of experts in patient oriented research and clinical trials in CKD (Primary mentor,
Dr. Tamara Isakova), CEUS (Co-mentor, Dr. Thomas Grant), biomarker development and validation (Dr.
Sushrut Waikar), CEUS image analysis (Dr. Jason Streeter), flow imaging (Dr. Michael Markl), and patient
oriented research with imaging endpoints (Dr. James Carr). Execution of the proposed studies, acquisition of
the training goals, and outstanding mentorship in a robust scientific environment at Northwestern University will
position Dr. Srivastava to transition to an independent investigator with unique expertise in use of novel non-
invasive imaging biomarkers in patient oriented research studies and clinical trials in patients with CKD."

Recent strategies to stimulate anti-cancer immune responses have transformed treatment options for many
cancer patients, but are critically hindered by the low abundance and/or suppression of lymphocytes in the
tumor microenvironment of many cancers. This work aims to address this significant problem in the context
of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which has among the worst prognoses among all cancers and for which
adaptive immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown limited success in improving patient outcomes. Strategies
to stimulate macrophage activity are increasingly being investigated, as macrophages constitute a high
percentage of total tumor cell mass in SCLC and many other cancers. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) can induce macrophages to both kill cancer cells via phagocytosis and to prime adaptive immune
responses. However, anti-phagocytic factors expressed by cancer cells, only some of which have been
identified, enable resistance to phagocytosis. My long-term goal is to advance our fundamental knowledge
of the mechanisms by which cancer cells evade antibody-dependent phagocytosis, which might create new
therapeutic avenues to enhance mAb efficacy. I will build on an innovative CRISPR/Cas9-screening
approach I have developed to identify factors that modulate cancer sensitivity to phagocytosis. This approach
revealed a suite of known and novel anti-phagocytic pathways. The objective of this proposal is to investigate
one of the most potent novel mechanisms I identified, and to test the central hypothesis that cancer cells
metabolize inflammatory lipids to avoid activating macrophages. In Aim 1, I will undertake a series of in vitro
experiments to understand the mechanistic basis of macrophage regulation by cancer-derived
immunostimulatory lipids. In Aim 2, I will determine how cancer lipid regulation affects innate and adaptive
anti-cancer immune responses using an immunocompetent mouse model for SCLC. Finally, in Aim 3, I will
systematically characterize synergies between diverse anti-phagocytic pathways in SCLC to reveal how lipid
regulators and other factors cooperate to block macrophage attack, which may suggest possible new
combination therapeutic strategies. The expected outcome of these related but independent aims is an
understanding of the molecular mechanisms of a novel immunosuppressive lipid metabolism pathway used
by diverse cancers, including SCLC, to evade mAb therapies. These aims will be pursued within the stellar
scientific environment of Stanford University, with research training and mentorship by an experienced team
of experts in functional genomics, cancer immunology, lipid signaling, and bioinformatics. The career
development plan involves research training in lipid analysis methods, mouse tumor models, and
computational analysis of genetic screens, as well as professional training in communication, mentoring, and
laboratory management, and will establish a strong foundation for my career as an independent investigator."
10746819,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Preterm infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) endure a multitude of stressors. Early life
stress may exceed their adaptive capacity and impede achievement of developmental milestones, such as oral
feeding. Up to 70% of NICU preterm infants are challenged to feed orally, leading to failure to thrive, prolonged
hospitalization, and high healthcare costs up to $200K per infant. There is considerable variation in the clinical
progression of oral feeding skill development across preterm infants, with some infants having more difficulty
than others. Robust evidence demonstrates that oral feeding skills require intact neurobehaviors. Early life
stress disrupts neurobehavior development, which may compromise achievement of oral feeding skills. Yet,
the extent to which early life stress impairs oral feeding skill development and the biomechanism whereby this
occurs are unknown. Exposure to early life stress during sensitive periods of neuroplasticity results in
epigenetic imprinting of stress response systems. Early life stress results in epigenetic modification of
glucocorticoid-related genes, i.e., DNA methylation (DNAm) of NR3C1 and HSD11B2, which alters
hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) regulation of cortisol levels and cortisol reactivity, disrupting
neurobehaviors. Epigenetic modifications due to early life stress are durable and may affect infants’ health far
beyond the neonatal period, increasing risk for life-long maladaptive feeding behaviors and poor health. The
purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which early life stress, reflected by DNAm of NR3C1 and
HSD11B2 gene promoters, compromises oral feeding skill development. In this prospective longitudinal study,
we will enroll 60 clinically stable preterm infants (28-32 weeks gestational age). We will evaluate early life
stress, DNAm of NR3C1 and HSD11B2 gene promoters, cortisol reactivity, neurobehaviors, and oral feeding
skill development during NICU stay and at 2-weeks post-discharge. The following specific aims will be
addressed. Aim 1. Determine the association among early life stress, cortisol reactivity, and oral feeding skill
development. Aim 2. Determine the extent to which DNAm of NR3C1 and HSD11B2 is associated with cortisol
reactivity and/or neurobehaviors. Aim 3. Determine the association among early life stress, DNAm of NR3C1
and HSD11B2, and oral feeding skill development. The proposed study will positively impact neonatal care by
contributing novel knowledge that clarifies biobehavioral mechanisms whereby early life stress compromises
progression of oral feeding skill development. The findings hold significant promise to identify modifiable
processes that can be targeted to promote optimal oral feeding, better nutrition, and lower risk for life-long
maladaptive eating behaviors."

Children and adolescents have the highest rate of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the general population, but
current tools for examining structural and functional deficits from MR data have several key limitations. First,
there is no gold standard procedure for considering lesions in imaging analysis, and second, existing tools
have been built on adult populations. We propose to develop a workflow that addresses both of these issues
and supports the extension of novel tools for advanced, multimodal analysis, and to use that workflow to
identify factors associated with outcome. Personalized Profiles of Pathology (P3) will include registration to
age-appropriate templates and lesion segmentation, allowing for voxelwise lesion symptom mapping,
morphometric analyses, shape analysis, and network diffusion modeling as part of the package, with options
for longitudinal analysis as well. This workflow will include and extend novel pipelines. Voxelwise lesion
symptom mapping examines the correspondence between lesion location and specific symptoms, but has
been underpowered in existing applications. Network diffusion modeling uses diffusion MRI data from healthy
individuals to model the spread of pathology. While this is currently used on chronically injured patients to
estimate the epicenter of injury, in this proposal, longitudinal data will be used to validate predictions of
pathology spread. Tract-wise statistical analysis similarly uses healthy data to predict the degree of
disconnection based on lesion location. Symmetric multivariate linear reduction reduces high dimensional
imaging, cognitive, and clinical data to components, revealing patterns of disruption. By including all of these
individual approaches across multiple sites, P3 will allow for multi-modal examination of the impact of TBI on
pediatric patients with greater statistical power. In Aim 1, we will develop and test P3 on cohorts from eight
sites. With input from clinical experts in neurology, rehabilitation, neuropsychology, radiology, and brain
development, and technical expertise from mathematics, computer science, and neuroimaging analytics, we
will ensure that P3 is statistically and computationally valid and clinically relevant. In Aim 2, we will extract
common neuropsychological endpoints from disparate scales across cohorts and use these measures with
brain metrics generated by P3 to determine factors associated with outcome and identify subgroups within the
patient population. In Aim 3, we will distribute P3 to a network of beta-testing sites to run locally, allowing for
further improvement and validation, and disseminate P3 to the research community. Through meta-analysis or
harmonization paired with mega-analysis, we will combine effects across sites and examine consistency in
effect size, location, and direction. Education will occur through tutorials at national and international
conferences, site visits, and through written documentation. P3 will be made available online, with continuing
support from the development team. The ultimate goal of P3 is to better understand heterogeneity in
post-injury outcome to inform future treatment development."
10772153,"Antibodies are generated by somatic recombination involving variable (V), diversity (D) and
joining (J) gene segments. During the previous grant cycle, we initiated studies aimed to
visualize VH-DHJH interactions in live cells. Using single color labeling we were able to track the
trajectories adopted by VH and DHJH elements. We found that VH and DHJH elements were
subjected to fractional Langevin motion, in which VH and DHJH elements bounce back and
forth in a spring-like fashion. However, since only a single genomic region was marked, this
approach did not permit us to directly monitor VH-DHJH interactions. To directly visualize VH-
DHJH encounters we developed a novel approach. We generated BCR-ABL transformed pro-
B cell lines that carried tandem arrays of wild-type TET-operator and mutant TET-operator
binding sites in the VH and DHJH regions, respectively. To mark the VH and DHJH regions
these cells were transduced with virus expressing WT-TET GFP and MUT-TET SNAP-TAG.
The results were surprising. VH-DHJH motion was severely sub-diffusive. We found that VH
regions were trapped in distinct chromatin configurations that were remarkably stable (<60
minutes). Only VH regions located nearby DHJH regions had a chance for a VH-DHJH
encounter. Comparison of simulated and experimental data suggested that such severely
sub-diffusive motion was imposed by geometric confinement (loop domains) and phase
separation/gelation (reversible cross-links within VH-DHJH and DH-JH loop domains). A caveat
of these studies is that they were performed using BCR-ABL transformed pro-B cells. Here we
propose to perform and extend these studies using primary pre-pro-B and pro-B cells.
Specifically, we would track VH-DHJH motion but now in primary B cell progenitors. We would
describe VH-DHJH motion in physical terms, including diffusion coefficients, scaling exponents,
velocities and spatial confinement. We would image across long-time scales to examine how
long VH and DHJH regions are trapped in distinct configurations and determine when (timing)
and how (speed) such configurations change. We would measure first-encounter times as well
as pairing times. We would examine whether transcriptional regulators and chromatin
remodelers modulate VH-DHJH motion and first-encounter times. We would identify critical
residues in RAG1 that would dictate pairing times. We would visualize VDJ recombination in
live cells. Data obtained from these experiments would reveal whether and how space and time
intersect to modulate the motion of paired coding and regulatory elements."
10772154,"The primary microstructural attributes seen in “normal” kidneys are nephrosclerosis (arteriosclerosis, global
glomerulosclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy), nephron number, and nephron size. However
manual measures of these microstructures are impractical. Further, understanding their pathophysiology may
lead to new interventions for kidney disease. Automated morphometry with deep learning (DL) networks may
be able to rapidly measure nephrosclerosis, nephron number, and nephron size. Novel morphometry of
structures impacted by glomerular hyperfiltration (podocyte and parietal epithelial cell (PEC) density,
Bowman’s space, and the diameter of proximal and distal tubule) and of microvasculature are needed to better
understand the pathophysiology of early disease. Proteomic analysis of specific microstructures that differ
between kidneys that do versus do not develop CKD outcomes has the potential to identify prognostic or even
pathogenic proteins for early kidney disease. The multi-discipline multi-site Aging Kidney Anatomy study has
unique resources for the study of microstructure in “normal” kidneys. This includes data and specimens on
living kidney donors including needle core biopsies at donation with digitized whole slide images (WSI) and
long-term CKD outcomes in the donor and recipient. This also includes data and specimens on patients who
had a radical nephrectomy for tumor including digitized WSI of kidney wedge sections and annual eGFR
testing for CKD outcomes during follow-up. Aim 1 will determine if automated morphometry of nephrosclerosis,
nephron number, and nephron size predicts CKD outcomes to test the hypothesis that DL tools allows for
efficient quantification of these clinically relevant microstructural attributes. This aim will use both previously
developed and new DL networks, develop models to predict CKD outcomes from automated morphometry,
and compare prediction of CKD outcomes between automated and manual morphometry. Aim 2 will
characterize novel microstructural attributes that associate with kidney function, CKD risk factors, and CKD
outcomes to test the hypothesis that encoded in the kidney tissue are unexplored structural attributes that
reflect the glomerular hyperfiltration and interstitial microvascular status that are prognostic for CKD. This aim
will automatically quantify podocytes, PECs, peritubular capillaries (PTC), Bowman’s space (volume), and
proximal and distal tubules (diameter) on WSI using previously developed and newly developed DL tools and
associate these structures with kidney function, CKD risk factors, and CKD outcomes. Aim 3 will discover
protein markers linked to the microstructural attributes that are prognostic for CKD outcomes to test the
hypothesis that differentially expressed proteins contained within kidney microstructures predict CKD
outcomes. This aim will use laser capture microdissection, mass spectroscopy-based proteomics (both
discovery and targeted validation approaches), and immunohistochemistry to identify proteins on kidney biopsy
sections that predict CKD outcomes and to determine their association with microstructural attributes."
10774335,"ABSTRACT
 Epidemiologic studies have linked obesity to poor breast cancer outcomes, and it has been suggested that
obese women may experience poorer outcomes, in part, due to inadequate dosing of cytotoxic agents among
obese women. Specifically, most cytotoxic agents are dosed according to body surface area, and therefore, the
larger the woman, the higher the absolute dose. However, evidence shows that clinicians are more likely to
depart from recommended dosing among heavier women for fear of inducing chemotherapy-associated toxicity.
In 2012, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) released guidelines stating that obese women
should be dosed according to their full body surface area, largely based on evidence that suggested that fully-
dosed obese women do not appear to experience more toxicity than fully-dosed normal-weight women.
However, the guidelines acknowledge that data are extremely limited with regard to more severe obesity and in
the real-world context of comorbidities. Furthermore, these guidelines cite that this practice of `dose reducing'
obese women may be one reason contributing to the poorer outcomes observed in this group. However, to
date, no empirical investigations have sought to determine if, and to what extent, dose-reduced chemotherapy
may explain differences in breast cancer survival. These guidelines were met with some criticism, citing the
need for further evidence, and data suggest continuing uncertainty about proper dosing of obese cancer
patients. Understanding the drivers of dose reductions may help better inform our understanding of this
practice and efforts to disseminate guidelines; however, we know little about factors driving dose intensity, and
how these factors may vary by body size.
 We therefore propose to address these gaps using data on nearly 34,000 Stage I-IIIA breast cancer
patients diagnosed and treated at Kaiser Permanente Northern California and at Group Health. Specifically, we
will use the rich data from these integrated healthcare delivery systems to examine the relationship between
body size and dose intensity, and will further examine how the factors contributing to dose reductions vary by
body size (Aim 1). We will also evaluate if, and to what extent, dose reductions mediate the association
between obesity and breast cancer recurrence and survival (Aim 2). Lastly, we will evaluate the association
between body size and toxicity among women identified as receiving the full BSA-determined dose of
chemotherapy (Aim 3). Our findings will provide critical and timely information to support or to warrant
modification of current recommendations for chemotherapy dosing for obese breast cancer patients. Given the
high and increasing prevalence of obesity in the United States, it is critical that we improve our understanding of
chemotherapy dosing. The knowledge gained from this study can be used to better inform optimal treatment for
the estimated 102,000 obese women diagnosed with breast cancer each year in the United States."

 In this study we will develop an agent-based simulation model (ABM) to help policy makers and health
professionals in North Carolina identify the best mix of cost-effective interventions to reduce opioid
overdoses (ODs) and related deaths. Interventions are identified in the NC Opioid Action Plan and cover
the Three Pillars: prevention, connection to care, and harm reduction.
 Our ABM will represent a community (e.g., a town) of individuals (patients, physicians, dealers, etc.), and
simulate how proposed interventions affect individual pathways to opioid misuse and other outcomes (i.e.,
OD death). The estimation of transition probabilities between the states in these pathways will be based on
data from several sources: North Carolina dashboard, national studies, and published literature. The model
will rely on a representative synthetic population, which allows multiple data types (e.g. prevention,
treatment) to be probabilistically connected in one model.
Aim 1. To develop a North Carolina-specific ABM that describes multiple pathways of opioid use in the
context of prescription practices, treatment modality and availability, the illegal drug market, prevention
policies, and other factors affecting the parameters of the various pathways that lead to OD fatalities.
Besides OD deaths, we will investigate multiple other sources of morbidity. We will leverage existing
national models and a representative synthetic population to examine spatial (community-level) and
temporal (short- and long-term) effects of prevention and treatment interventions on opioid misuse and
ODs. We will validate the model on North Carolina data from the past 13 years and will evaluate the
sources of prediction uncertainty.
Aim 2. To predict the response to the mix of interventions specified in the North Carolina Opioid Action
Plan at the local level (e.g., county). The policies include reducing the over prescription of POs, increasing
naloxone availability, increasing community awareness, and expanding treatment and recovery care. We
will estimate the uncertainty of the forecasts accounting for the changing policy and environmental factors
and will refine the model on the basis of new data from the NC DHHS. We will discuss the results with the
expert panel and will disseminate data-driven recommendations to North Carolina stakeholders to generate
public health impact.
Aim 3. To estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of the key interventions in Aim 2 and compare them
with the status quo. For each intervention, we will work with the NC DHHS to estimate costs and cost
variation by county characteristics (e.g., population density, poverty). The model will address a significant
public health problem and will inform policy on the short- and long-term cost-effectiveness of these
interventions."

Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) cause life-threatening bacterial meningitis and sepsis and N. gonorrhoeae
(Ng) cause millions of sexually transmitted infections annually. Emerging multiple antibiotic resistance
by Ng and recent increases in incidence have led to its designation as an urgent threat by the CDC.
There are no licensed Nm vaccines in the US for <10 year olds, the population at greatest risk of
disease and no licensed Ng vaccine. We have developed an Nm serogroup B (NmB) vaccine based on
native outer membrane vesicles (NOMV) with genetically attenuated endotoxin activity and over-
expressed mutant Factor H binding protein (FHbp) with reduced FH binding. In both mice and infant
macaques, the vaccine elicited much higher human complement-mediated serum bactericidal antibody
(SBA) responses than a licensed NmB vaccine. The vaccine, NOMV-FHbp, also elicited SBA against
Ng in mice and in infant macaques. We used anti-NOMV-FHbp antibodies to identify Ng antigens that
are highly conserved between Nm and Ng. Our hypothesis is that an NOMV vaccine with over
produced mutant FHbps from subfamilies A and B and conserved Nm/Ng antigens will elicit antibodies
that provide broad protection against disease by both pathogens in all age groups. In Aim 1, we will use
an engineered promoter to over produce mutant FHbps from subfamilies A and B and two or more
highly conserved Ng antigens that elicit protective antibodies (NmNg-NOMV vaccine). In Aim 2, we will
test the ability of NmNg-NOMV to prevent colonization and invasion in immortalized and primary nasal
and cervical cell culture models. In Aim 3, we will test the ability of optimized NmNg-NOMV vaccines to
prevent colonization and symptoms of disease in transgenic mouse models of meningococcal nasal
colonization and meningitis and in a female estradiol-treated Tg mouse model of gonococcal vaginal
colonization. Preventing colonization and invasion is important for providing individual protection
against disease and preventing transmission between individuals (i.e. “community immunity”). The
overall goal is development of an NOMV vaccine platform for expression of conserved Neisseria
antigens with native structures that can elicit broadly protective antibodies against both pathogens.
Successful development of an NmNg-NOMV vaccine would have a significant public health impact
world-wide."

 Non-polio enteroviruses (NPEVs) are etiological agents for several human diseases including respiratory
infections, hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, neonatal sepsis,
myocarditis, conjunctivitis, and acute flaccid paralysis. Among the more than 100 serotypes of NPEVs, some of
the most significant pathogens are enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus B3
(CV-B3). According to CDC, these NPEVs combined have caused 10 to 15 million infections and tens of
thousands of hospitalizations in the U.S. Clearly, NPEVs are a public concern for both U.S. and the world.
 No vaccines are available in the U.S. for the NPEVs such as EV-D68, EV-A71, and CV-B3. Three
inactivated EV-A71 vaccines are available in China. However, there are not broadly protective, and the efficacy
is limited to certain strains. There is no FDA-approved antiviral for any of these NPEVs. Thus, there is a
pressing need to develop orally bioavailable pan-enterovirus antivirals.
 This proposal focuses on targeting the enterovirus nonstructural 2C protein for the development of orally
bioavailable broad-spectrum NPEV antivirals. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will optimize the antiviral activity and
pharmacokinetic properties of three series of 2C inhibitors. In Aim 2, we will determine the high-resolution X-
ray crystal structures of EV-A71, EV-D68, and CV-B3 2C proteins with structurally disparate 2C inhibitors. In
Aim 3, we will evaluate the in vivo antiviral efficacy of 2C inhibitors in EV-D68 and EV-A71 infection mouse
models. Successful implementation of this proposal will provide orally bioavailable broad-spectrum NPEV drug
candidates for further development."

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multi-organ autoimmune disease that is 2-4x more common among
Black that White persons. Black patients with SLE are 6-7x more likely to suffer from kidney failure and die 13
years younger. Exacerbating these disparities, Black patients with SLE also have worse medication
adherence, which is partially explained by mistrust about medicines and the medical system. Trust can be built
through effective patient-clinician communication, but unfortunately, effective adherence communication occurs
sporadically, and Black patients experience poorer communication quality with clinicians and participate less in
decision making in clinic visits. Adherence interventions in SLE to date have only had limited success with
patient reminders and education and have not attended to the quality of patient-clinician communication nor
focused on ameliorating racial disparities in SLE medication adherence. The long-term goal is to reduce racial
disparities and improve health outcomes among patients with SLE. The overall objective of this proposal is to
optimize the culturally appropriate delivery and test the effect of CO-LEADER (COmmunication for Lupus
Equity in Adherence with DOSE-Nonadherence-SLE and Refill data), a simple and flexible intervention that
combines clinician training in communication skills centered around the needs of Black patients to effectively
utilized pharmacy refill data with patient-reported adherence barriers. Pilot data for CO-LEADER suggest that
1) it is feasible, 2) it can be performed with high fidelity, 3) it enables consistent adherence discussions with
excellent patient-clinician communication, and 4) it improves medication adherence while reducing racial
disparities. A Hybrid Type I design will be used to conduct a cluster randomized trial of CO-LEADER at 2
racially diverse rheumatology clinics. Informed by the Ecological Model of Patient-Centered Communication,
the central hypothesis is that CO-LEADER enables clinicians to consistently discover and collaboratively
address patients’ adherence barriers. More effective adherence discussions will then enhance shared
understanding, therapeutic alliance, and trust, thereby improving medication adherence, particularly for Black
patients. The aims of the study will compare important outcomes between clinicians randomized to CO-
LEADER and usual care to test the effect of the intervention on 1) patient-clinician communication via clinic
visit audio recordings and patient surveys, and 2) SLE medication adherence via pharmacy refill data. The
study will also simultaneously evaluate relevant implementation outcomes to identify areas for improvement in
the intervention’s delivery. This innovative proposal is the first to test a SLE adherence intervention with an eye
for equity in patient-clinician communication and medication adherence. The proposal is significant because
successful completion of the award will provide robust data on a culturally tailored intervention that has high
potential for implementation across many health systems to fill a critical gap in the care of patients with SLE."
10764489,"Under steady-state conditions, >90% of tryptophan (Trp) catabolism occurs in the liver via the kynurenine (Kyn)
pathway. However, this process has important pathophysiological roles in the brain, kidneys and heart, as well
as in modulating immunity, tumor microenvironments, and pregnancy. Altered Kyn metabolism is observed in
aging, cardiovascular disease, organ injury, cancer, and transplantation, where it often is a strong predictor of
outcome. Despite their relevance, the mechanisms behind the effects resulting from changes in systemic and
local Kyn metabolism are poorly defined. Using untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry together with
isotopically labeled standards, we discovered the endogenous formation of the electrophilic mediator kynurenine-
carboxyketoalkene (Kyn-CKA) secondary to in vivo Kyn deamination in humans and mice. Kyn-CKA reacts
covalently with cysteine residues in transcription factors, transcriptional regulatory proteins and enzymes to
regulate protein and cellular function. We recently published that Kyn-CKA modulates TLR/NF-κB- and
Keap1/Nrf2-dependent signaling and our preliminary data shows that Kyn-CKA also affects bioenergetic
metabolism and impacts seemingly cysteine-independent processes. Furthermore, we now know that N-formyl-
kynurenine (NFK) and 3-hydroxy-kynurenine (OH-Kyn) also generate electrophiles in vivo. We hypothesize that
Trp catabolism via the Kyn pathway results in the formation of novel bioactive products that adaptively modulate
cellular responses via redox-dependent mechanisms. We propose to characterize the mechanisms that regulate
the formation of Trp-derived electrophiles via modulation of individual enzymes in the Kyn pathway and the
identification of potential enzymes capable of catalyzing NFK, Kyn and OH-Kyn deamination. Trp-derived
electrophiles undergo conjugation to glutathione and reductive inactivation, thus we will identify and kinetically
characterize the enzymes involved in these processes. Unbiased high resolution mass spectrometry and
isotopically labeled precursors will be used to discover pathways for inactivation and biotransformation of Trp-
derived electrophiles. Furthermore, we will characterize the effects of Trp-derived electrophiles on cellular and
tissue bioenergetic metabolism, first using hepatocytes and then expanding to other cell types as informed by in
vivo formation data. In this regard, we will establish the impact of dietary Trp intake regulation on systemic and
tissue Trp-derived electrophile levels, as well as assess a potential contribution of the microbiome to this process.
Finally, we will use spatial transcriptomics in conjunction with click chemistry-dependent labeling strategies to
elucidate the sites of azido-Kyn deamination in vivo and define the impact of this process on electrophile-targeted
and untargeted regions of interest to differentiate between proximal and paracrine signaling effects. Overall, our
discovery that the Kyn pathway is a source of bioactive electrophiles has the potential to transform our
understanding of Trp biology. We expect our research provide a solid biochemical foundation that will enable the
development of novel clinical approaches for conditions in which Trp metabolism is dysregulated."

Integral membrane protein quality control systems are present within every major eukaryotic organelle. The
archetypal integral membrane protein quality control system is called Endoplasmic reticulum-associated
degradation (ERAD). For ERAD, ER proteins are degraded, either because they are misfolded or because their
degradation is physiologically regulated. While its primary function is to target misfolded or regulated proteins,
ERAD also functions to alleviate ER stress and is exploited by bacterial and viral pathogens to gain access to
the cytosol and degrade host cell immune complexes. During normal ERAD, protein targets are selected within
the ER lumen and transported across the membrane to the cytosol (retrotranslocation). Once in the cytosol, the
targets are polyubiquitinated, extracted/dislocated from the membrane, and degraded by the proteasome. Even
with decades of genetic, biochemical, and structural data, many aspects of ERAD remain ambiguous. Currently,
basic information like the degrons that target substrates to the ERAD system, the mechanics for how ERAD
interacts with target proteins, and even the range of cellular pathways under the control of ERAD are mysterious.
The goals of this proposal are to: 1) define the features of targets directing them to ERAD (the degrons), 2)
determine how the ERAD system recognizes, and retrotranslocates, target proteins across the ER membrane,
3) understand how the membrane composition controls ERAD function, 4) dissect the mechanics of other (non-
ERAD) integral membrane protein quality control systems. We will use a multifaceted approach with
biochemistry, cell biology, and genetics to address these central questions in membrane-associated protein
quality control. We will leverage our unique in vivo and in vitro assays (and continue to design innovative assays)
to dissect the mechanisms of target degradation by eukaryotic systems. A mechanistic understanding of how
these systems function (including ERAD) and the processes they regulate will establish these systems as viable
therapeutic targets in medically relevant pathways of protein misfolding, protein misregulation, and pathogen
hijacking."

The long-term goals of this project are to understand the composition, assembly, and function of specialized
chromatin domains. Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins interact to form enzyme complexes that modify
chromatin and assemble repressed chromatin states in animals, plants, and some fungi. Polycomb
Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is a highly conserved histone methyltransferase complex that is essential for
multicellular development and plays key roles in maintenance of stem cell identify, X-chromosome
inactivation, and gene regulation. Mutations that alter PRC2 function are responsible for human Weaver
syndrome and multiple cancers. Despite the importance of PcG proteins in human health and nearly 80
years of investigation, important mechanistic details regarding the establishment and epigenetic inheritance
of PcG repressed chromatin remain unknown. Our studies with the model fungus Neurospora crassa have
begun to address these critical gaps in knowledge. N. crassa is a powerful experimental system that shares
key features of the PcG system with higher eukaryotes. Importantly, components of PRC2 are structurally
and functionally conserved, in contrast to major yeast models Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Our recent efforts have uncovered new genes required for PcG repression
and have begun to generate mechanistic insights into their functions. We will apply hypothesis-driven
genetic, molecular, proteomic, and genomic approaches to define functions of newly identified genes, and
we will perform discovery-driven genetic screens to identify new regulators and components of Polycomb
repressed chromatin domains. Major questions will be addressed during the grant period include. 1) What
are the mechanisms that control de novo establishment, spreading, and epigenetic inheritance of
H3K27me3? 2) How does ISWI, a nucleosome sliding ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzyme
control to assembly and maintenance of PcG repressed domains? 3) How are H3K27me3 levels re-
established following DNA replication? 4) What other factors control and comprise PcG-repressed chromatin
domains? Successful completion of the proposed aims will uncover general principles and mechanisms
governing assembly and function of PcG-repressed chromatin domains. Findings from these studies will
serve as a framework for future studies in higher eukaryotes, including humans. In addition, because PcG
proteins are linked to cancer and other genetic diseases, understanding the regulation and function of these
key chromatin regulators will ultimately improve diagnosis and treatment of human disease."

Enzymes catalyze selective small-molecule transformations with activity and selectivity that is seldom matched
by non-biological catalysts. Metalloenzymes, such as non-heme iron enzymes (NHIEs), catalyze a diverse array
of reactions involving C–H activation that are relevant to natural product biosynthesis and would be of great
benefit if harnessed for medicinal chemistry. Understanding the role of the secondary sphere in catalysis is
essential for describing how these enzymes work and for designing mimic catalysts capable of similar
transformations under a wider range of conditions (i.e., pH and temperature) amenable to industrial catalysis.
Computational modeling provides insight into the sources of enzymatic rate enhancement, the dynamics of
substrates in the active site, and in the mechanism of biomimetic catalysts, all of which are challenging to
determine experimentally. However, for difficult cases such as NHIEs, existing modeling techniques provide
limited mechanistic insight because they are either too costly, too inaccurate, or require too much existing
knowledge and user intervention. The overall vision for the PI's research program is to develop systematic
methods and novel workflows to overcome cost–accuracy trade-offs in computational modeling for the discovery
of new catalysts and understanding of enzymes. The PI has advanced the first machine learning (ML) models to
discover new transition metal catalysts from millions of candidates, identifying opportunities to overcome trade-
offs in catalyst performance. She has developed novel strategies for unveiling noncovalent interactions in NHIEs
that determine their reaction selectivity and validated her predictions with experimental collaborators. The PI has
advanced methods for making QM/MM systematic and robust and applied them to identifying contributions of
rate enhancement in enzymes to determine where biomimetic counterparts fail. She has developed ML models
to identify and avoid errors in first-principles modeling. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that
development of novel low-cost methods that enable the generation of larger datasets will reveal structure–
property relationships in enzymatic and biomimetic C–H activation. The rationale is that dynamic effects and
interactions with second-sphere residues that distinguish enzymes that catalyze different reactions cannot be
understood without sufficient sampling and a broad comparison of behavior across the enzyme family. Over the
next five years, the PI will 1) develop models for the prediction of regioselectivity in non-heme iron enzymes
using neural network potentials to enable sampling, 2) systematically determine environmental contributions to
catalysis, and 3) discover bioinspired homogeneous catalysts. The proposed research will produce a framework
for predictive modeling in biological and bioinspired catalysis. The goals build upon methods the PI's lab has
developed for modeling enzymes and non-biological systems and the recent results they have produced related
to ML-accelerated catalyst screening and non-heme iron enzyme modeling."
10766249,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Regulated gene expression is crucial for normal development of an organism. Although transcriptional
regulation has been extensively studied, mechanisms that select the transcription start site (TSS) are only
partially understood. Alternative transcription initiation (ATI), which is the transcription of a gene from different
TSSs, is found prevalent in mammalian systems and has important biological functions. Furthermore, TSS
choices of genes seem to vary among tissues and across developmental stages, indicating that ATI is regulated
and widely used. However, how TSSs are selected in specific cell types or developmental stages has not been
examined and majority of alternative TSSs still have unknown functions. Therefore, it is important to investigate
how TSS selection is regulated.
 Using the cap-analysis gene expression sequencing (CAGE-seq) method, we identified genes coding for
mRNA and long non-coding RNA with altered TSS usage in Drosophila ovaries upon loss of Piwi. Our preliminary
data indicate that Piwi regulates the selection of TSSs in Drosophila ovaries. Based on this exciting finding, I
propose to investigate the molecular mechanism of Piwi-dependent TSS selection. Piwi is known to silence
transposons and affect gene expression and these regulations are guided by piRNAs. Therefore, I hypothesize
that the Piwi-piRNA pathway regulates TSS selection in Drosophila ovaries via a piRNA-guided mechanism.
 In this proposed research project, I will investigate the role of piRNAs in TSS usage regulation by
computational analysis and experimental validation. I will knockdown specific piRNAs in wildtype flies and
examine target genes’ TSS usage. I will explore changes in RNA polymerase occupancy, chromatin
configuration, and the epigenetic landscape in genes with altered TSS usage in piwi mutants via ChIP-seq and
ATAC-seq experiments. Furthermore, I will identify Piwi-interacting proteins on chromatin involved in TSS
selection regulation using the conventional immunoprecipitation in combination with fractionation and mass
spectrometry. The proposed work will identify a novel TSS selection regulatory mechanism and its involved
factors. Importantly, Piwi is essential for germline stem cell maintenance and gonadal development. Completion
of this project will provide new knowledge on how Piwi regulated transcription initiation and TSS usage affect
ovarian development. Moreover, it will reveal a novel TSS selection mechanism with potentially broad
implications in transcriptional regulation of many biological processes in other organisms."
10935969,"Annually, approximately 100,000 patients in the USA suffer from intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), which is
associated with high mortality rates and poor long-term cognitive and physical recovery. At present, no
pharmacological therapies have been demonstrated to improve functional outcomes after ICH. However, we
have successfully demonstrated that CN-105, a pentapeptide derived from the receptor binding surface of the
apolipoprotein E (apoE), is a highly promising therapy for improving recovery after ICH. CN-105 was rationally
designed to mimic the LRP-1 receptor binding face of the apoE holoprotein, which binds the cell surface low
density lipoprotein-related (LRP1) receptor, reducing microglial activation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal
excitotoxicity. We demonstrated that CN-105 has excellent CNS penetration, is well tolerated, and retains the
anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of endogenous apoE holoprotein.
In the Phase 1 of this STTR, we demonstrated CN-105's preclinical efficacy across species, sex, age, and
hypertensive comorbidity, as evidence to support efficacy phase clinical trials. Our preclinical work with CN-105
has led to the successful completion of an IND and translation to a Phase 1 single- and multiple-escalating dose
study (NCT02670824), where CN-105 demonstrated excellent clinical safety profile and linear pharmacokinetics.
Based on the successful completion of the Phase 1 trial and after consultation with and funding from the FDA,
we completed and recently published the CN-105 in participants from the Acute supraTentorial
intraCerebral Hemorrhage (CATCH) trial, a multisite open-label safety study in patients with acute ICH
(NCT03168581)1, which demonstrated early efficacy, and completed a parallel randomized placebo-controlled
clinical trial in patients with ICH in Singapore (S-CATCH; NCT03711903).
Together the CATCH and S-CATCH trials will allow insight into target engagement and therapeutic efficacy of
CN-105 via analyses of serologic proteins and radiographic surrogates. Given the orphan drug status of CN-
105, our preliminary data are critical to rationally inform the development of a larger and definitive ICH study. In
the current proposal, we will design an adaptive Phase 2b/3 clinical trial to evaluate CN-105 efficacy, in
collaboration with StrokeNet and the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) (Milestone 1). To form the basis
for trial adaptation, we will utilize radiographic and serologic data already collected in the completed CATCH and
S-CATCH trials to characterize an algorithm for screening treatment response to CN-105 (Milestone 2)."
10765379,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Dysfunctional decision making has devastating impacts on individuals and on society. Many types of
decision making are therefore under vigorous investigation. This proposal emphasizes value-based decisions,
in which choosers select among options based on their subjective assessment of value. A deeper understand-
ing of this behavior is needed to develop the best possible treatments for decision making disorders, including
many forms of addiction and cognitive deficits that accompany mental illness, brain injury, and neurodegenera-
tive disease.
 Consumer choice is one of the best studied forms of value-based decisions. Studies reveal that our
economic personalities have a significant genetic basis, but it is difficult to trace causal links between genes
and behavior in humans. In response, geneticists often turn to simpler invertebrate organisms like the nema-
tode worm C. elegans in which the functions of genes nearly identical to their human equivalents can be inves-
tigated more rapidly, completely, and at a fraction of the cost. Until now, evidence that nematodes are truly ca-
pable of value-based decision making has merely been suggestive. However, economists have developed
mathematically rigorous testing procedures for determining whether decisions are based on subjective value.
The PI's laboratory has developed microfluidic devices that enable this test to be done on nematodes deciding
between high-quality food that is relatively abundant and low-quality food that is more scarce. The results meet
all the criteria of value-based decision making.
 Previous work in the PI’s laboratory and others has delineated the neural circuits for all three of the
main foraging behaviors of C. elegans. At the same time, whole-brain neuronal imaging has come of age in
this organism, including transgenic strains in which essentially all neurons in the brain can be identified unam-
biguously. Capitalizing on these new developments, the proposed research address three broad yet interre-
lated questions: How is subjective value represented? How is subjective value translated into action? How is
subjective value learned? How is subjective value altered by drugs of abuse?
 Successful completion of the proposed research yields a biologically realistic computational model of
the neuronal mechanism of value-based decision making in a compact circuit than can, in principle, be under-
stood completely. This work provides a foundation for understanding value-based decisions in more complex
organisms. The work also lays the cornerstone for genetic analyses, at single-neuron resolution, of orthologs of
human genes identified in association studies related to decision making. The research is broadly significant
because it establishes a new biological system in which to analyze at single-neuron resolution the interaction
of genes previously associated with decision making in humans, and to discover novel genetic pathways in-
volved in this behavior."
10765436,"ABSTRACT
My research has aimed at accessing a previously hidden source of natural products that are encoded
in bacterial genomes, and at investigating their structures, functions, therapeutic uses, and
biosynthetic pathways. We have developed new methods to turn on production of `cryptic' natural
products and shown that low-dose antibiotics are especially effective at stimulating secondary
metabolism. We have explored the functions of secondary metabolites in microbial symbiotic
interactions, and contributed to natural product biosynthesis by uncovering over a dozen novel and
unusual metalloenzyme-catalyzed transformations, including those involved in antibiotic biogenesis.
The breadth of our work has addressed the chemistry, biology, and enzymology of microbial
secondary metabolism. My vision for the next five years is a similarly holistic approach toward
illuminating this generally understudied aspect of microbial physiology by applying it to the human
microbiome and overall expanding the chemical space of microbial natural products. Our work will be
guided by three main questions: (i) Are there cryptic metabolites in diverse genera, notably the human
microbiome and, if so, how can they be elicited? The human microbiome provides an especially intriguing
source of bacteria that can play critical roles in health and disease. Because bacteria sense and respond
to the world around them with small molecules, it is reasonable to expect that human microbiota are
sources of inducible, health-relevant natural products. (ii) Can biosynthesis-guided approaches be
leveraged to find unusual constitutive natural products in the human microbiome? Using a new
bioinformatic search protocol, we recently mapped the `universe' of ribosomal peptide natural products
synthesized by radical SAM metalloenzymes, providing an unexplored expanse of microbial biocatalysis.
The reaction scope of these enzymes will shine light on the transformations that bacteria in the
microbiome have at their disposal for concocting complex peptide natural products. (iii) Can we expand
the chemical space of natural products through a targeted search for selenium-containing metabolites?
We have recently identified the first dedicated biosynthetic pathway for incorporation of selenium into a
natural product. Genomic evidence suggests that there are many more to be discovered. Metabolite-
centric and genome-guided approaches could open the door to a collection of natural products that
contain selenium. Answering these questions will chart a new path in microbial metabolism, provide
insights into metabolites and virulence factors produced by human microbiota, and expand the chemical
space of microbial natural products."
10765489,"Organosulfur compounds have had a profound effect on the improvement of human health and well-being.
They comprise a quarter of the most prescribed small molecule drugs, with sulfur featuring as one of the three
most common heteroatoms. Organosulfur compounds also have central roles in organic synthesis and are used
extensively for the construction of drugs, biological probes, synthetic intermediates, and advanced materials for
biomedical applications. Despite the medicinal and synthetic importance of organosulfur compounds, their
divergent properties and reactivities that are amplified by a range of oxidation states and substitution patterns
available for the sulfur atom present significant challenges to the development of selective synthetic
transformations, impeding progress in medicinal chemistry and organic synthesis. Our long-term goal is to
advance organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry by enabling synthetic access to centrally important
organosulfur compounds and by systematically developing their regio- and stereoselective transformations to
broad classes of valuable functionalities and structural motifs. Sulfinates have emerged as centrally important
intermediates that have the potential to provide access to all major classes of organosulfur compounds and
facilitate construction of carbon-carbon bonds. However, the scope of synthetic transformations of sulfinates
that convert a variety of functional groups to organosulfur compounds, in particular the underdeveloped but
medicinally important sulfoxides and sulfonimido compounds, remains small, and the reactivity of sulfinates in
the context of stereoselective C‒C bond forming cross-coupling reactions is nearly entirely unexplored. Our
research program will address these limitations by innovating new sulfinate-based synthetic methodologies for
efficient construction of carbon-heteroatom and carbon-carbon bonds. In the first part, we will develop a radical-
based platform for the conversion of synthetically important functional groups to sulfoxides in a reaction with
sulfinates and extend it to sulfonimido compounds. In the second part, we will develop a broad-scope,
stereodivergent dienylation reaction for the construction of conjugated dienes and polyenes with sulfolenes as
readily available dienylating reagents and sulfinates as intermediates. In the third part, the sulfinate-based
methodology will be expanded to the construction of bis-ortho-substituted biaryl motifs that are some of the
most widely used structural units in drug discovery and ligand design. The research program will enable access
to currently synthetically challenging functionalized molecules and will contribute to the improvement of
human health by facilitating drug discovery and access to new small molecule medicines."
10928171,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common complex condition associated with high morbidity and mortality, with
a prevalence estimated at 13% in the U.S. that continues to increase annually. The etiology of CKD is complex,
with both genetic – including monogenetic and polygenic – and environmental contributions playing major roles.
African American and Hispanic communities in the U.S. are disproportionally affected by CKD; environmental,
socioeconomic, and inherited factors, such as APOL1 risk genotypes, are likely contributing to these disparities.
Multi-omic approaches including genetics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics are high-
throughput technologies being leveraged for precision medicine that hold great potential to improve diagnosis
and clinical care for complex diseases such as CKD. As part of the Multi-omics Health and Disease Consortium,
this proposal will establish a Disease Study Site (DSS) focused on CKD. Our rationale for selecting CKD is three-
fold: 1) CKD has high cost and public health impact in the U.S. and disproportionally affects minority populations
underrepresented in genomic research; 2) CKD represents an important modifier of multi-omic profiles in other
common conditions; and 3) there is an urgent, unmet need to provide molecular disease subclassification in CKD
– and in particular non-diabetic CKD – as the current diagnosis relies solely on functional rather than molecular
criteria. Our hypothesis is that longitudinal blood and urine multi-omics can provide non-invasive means to better
subclassify non-diabetic CKD, and thus provide a new precision medicine-based approach for this condition. In
alignment with the mission of the consortium, our DSS also aims to address current disparities in kidney disease
and genomics, considering that individuals of non-European ancestry are overwhelming under-represented in
human genetic and multi-omic studies of kidney disease. To this end, we propose a prospective study of 200
CKD patients and 100 non-CKD controls of diverse ancestral backgrounds, with at least 75% of participants from
groups underrepresented in research. We will address the following questions: What are the molecular correlates
of longitudinal decline in renal function in ancestrally diverse patients? Are there specific molecular subtypes of
non-diabetic CKD identifiable by longitudinal multi-omics? What are the roles of environmental exposures, social
and economic stressors, and genetics in determining molecular CKD subtypes? Our team involves national
leaders in Precision Medicine and has a track record of successful execution of genetic, epidemiologic, and
interventional studies involving diverse underrepresented populations. We will coordinate efficient local
recruitment of our prospective cohort using innovative outreach methods that address barriers to recruiting
under-represented groups. Our long-term goal is to promote health equity and challenge the existing clinical
paradigms in CKD and multi-omics more broadly to advance precision medicine."

Project summary
 Women living with HIV (WLWH) have a higher risk of cervical cancer because of incomplete immune
reconstitution and high prevalence of risk factors for cervical cancer. The risk is greater among African American
(AA) WLWH in economically and socially disadvantaged areas such as West Baltimore because of intersection
with race, gender, social determinants of health (SDOH), and HIV co-morbidities including substance abuse.
Despite the widespread availability of population-based cervical cancer screening in the US, AA-WLWH living in
disadvantaged areas have lower rates of screening uptake. Strategic evaluations of recently developed and
emerging methods and technologies for cervical cancer prevention in intended use settings are urgently needed
to address the cervical cancer prevention needs of this population.
 In the BaCSS project, we engage the clinical and population science resources of the University of
Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) to establish a clinical study site for the CASCADE network. The site will
enroll AA-WLWH into implementation science studies and clinical trials of evidence-based interventions for the
prevention and early diagnosis of cervical cancer. The project provides operational leadership and pluripotent
infrastructure for these studies in the CASCADE network and supports the development of concepts and
protocols for pragmatic clinical trials of the effectiveness of clinically proven interventions to overcome barriers
and reduce failures in cervical cancer prevention in WLWH."
10931724,"Project Summary
 Children with reading disabilities (RD) have twice the risk of developing an anxiety disorder compared
to typically-developing peers, and this comorbidity significantly impacts children’s quality of life and well-being.
Work from our group and others suggests that anxiety symptoms are very common and impairing, and yet
remain unassessed and untreated in the vast majority of children with RD. In this proposal, we aim to define
the correlates and trajectory of reading and other clinical anxiety symptoms in children with RD through four
aims focused on the differentiation of anxiety subtypes (Aim 1), the academic and cognitive correlates of
anxiety symptoms (Aims 2 & 3), and the developmental trajectory of anxiety symptoms (Aim 4) in children with
RD. Each of these aims is designed to identify mechanisms that have high translational potential for
assessment and prevention/treatment targets. The aims will be accomplished using two samples, one clinic-
referred and one community-based. The clinic-referred sample will consist of N~600 children, ages 6-17 (in
collaboration with Project I) who will be recruited through the in-house developmental neuropsychology training
clinics at DU and CU Boulder. The community-based sample consists of N=230 children ages 8-12 recruited in
the past LDRC cycle and who we will follow longitudinally 5 years later when they are 13-17 years old. The
Project II research team exemplifies an interdisciplinary collaborative approach that bridges the learning
disabilities and child mental health fields and is responsive to the RFA request to “generate new scientific
knowledge to inform understanding of specific learning disorders (SLDs) and comorbid conditions through
synergistic, integrated, team-based transdisciplinary science.” Our focus on a clinically referred sample
addresses the RFA to “embrace the complexities of studying SLDs in the real world inclusive of the context of
multiple comorbid or co-occurring conditions” and we have leveraged several resources in this application that
will make our clinical neuropsychological services and resulting research pipeline more financially accessible.
We are uniquely positioned to accomplish these aims because of our long-standing clinical-research
partnerships and our expertise in learning disabilities and youth anxiety. Overall, these aims reflect some of
the earliest work characterizing the interplay of reading and anxiety and will contribute novel insights with high
translational potential for assessment, prevention, and intervention for children with comorbid anxiety and RD.
Project II is squarely focused on the larger Center aim of understanding the comorbidity of learning disabilities
and mental health and will generate key findings that inform the genetic, imaging, neuropsychological, and
intervention goals of the Center."
10931727,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall objective of the current project is to determine how brain systems are altered in children and youth
who are experiencing difficulties in each of reading and math specifically. Recent research suggests that control
processes that aid in goal-oriented behaviors and task performance, known as executive function, are often
altered in children and youth who are having reading and/or math difficulties. Specific regions of the brain, mainly
in the prefrontal cortex, play a prominent role in executive function. These executive regions act by altering or
modulating activity in other brain regions, consistent with their role in control processes. Yet prior studies have
mainly focused on brain regions more specifically involved in reading and math rather than regions involved in
executive processes. The first main aim of the proposed project will examine how connectivity between these
prefrontal brain regions and areas of the brain that are important for each of these domains — left temporo-
parietal regions with regards to reading, and the right intraparietal sulcus with regards to math — may be altered
in individuals with reading and math difficulties, respectively. To do so, 160 individuals aged 10-16 who are likely
to have reading and/or math difficulties will undergo functional neuroimaging while they perform three types of
tasks – a reading task, a math task, and an executive control task. These data will be combined with a previously
collected sample of approximately the same size who performed the same neuroimaging tasks, but who are
more typically developing. Whether patterns of connectivity from prefrontal areas across each of the three tasks
differ in those who have reading difficulties as compared to those who do not will be determined, with parallel
analyses performed for those who have math difficulties versus those who do not. Of interest will be the degree
to which disrupted connectivity is similar or distinct in individuals with reading difficulties as compared to those
with math difficulties. A second main aim is to test the hypothesis that such connectivity is influenced by an
individual’s level of reading and/or math anxiety. Not much is known about the neural underpinnings of these
academically-related aspects of anxiety. In addition, this aim will also examine how these aspects of anxiety
influence connectivity from prefrontal executive regions to brain regions involved in emotional processing. Finally,
the third aim of this project will take a novel computational approach of graphing the brain network during each
task and while participants are at rest. These networks will be computationally “lesioned” by iteratively removing
nodes to determine how the overall functioning of the network is altered by such removal. This approach will
isolate those regions that most critically distinguish individuals with and without reading difficulties and likewise
with or without math difficulties. The results of this project will shed light on the degree to which connectivity from
brain regions involved in executive processes may contribute to the etiology of reading and math difficulties. To
the degree that these patterns of neural connectivity are altered, it would suggest that evaluation and remediation
should include consideration of the role of executive processes in reading and math difficulties."
10931730,"The high prevalence of comorbidity between specific learning disabilities (SLDs), with other conditions, and
their associations with genes in common with all of them, strongly suggest substantial pleiotropic effects that
transcend diagnostic boundaries. While several of these genes with associations across SLDs are known, the
nature, scope, and mechanisms of these pleiotropic effects remain unclear. The goal of this project is to
examine genetic convergence and divergence that transcend clinical diagnostic categories for SLDs that could
account for the high prevalence of comorbidity. Based on our track record of genetic research in comorbid
SLDs, we hypothesize that elucidating the biological significance of cross-disorder genetic influences will
reveal fundamental properties of pleiotropic loci that differentiate them from disorder-specific loci and help to
clarify the biological substrates shared across the diagnostic landscape of SLDs. To test this hypothesis, we
have assembled data for genome-wide association study (GWAS) and summary statistics for SLD-related
traits in 17 samples that we utilize to examine shared genetic effects.
In Aim 1 we propose to apply genomic structural equation modeling (Genomic SEM) to model the multivariate,
genome-wide architecture of SLD-related traits by bringing together the largest available GWAS summary
statistics within the learning disorder space. This will describe how different SLD components and disorders
cluster together at the genomic level of analysis and identify clinically relevant external traits, for example
anxiety and attention, that are associated with these clusters. Next, in Aim 2 we propose to apply Stratified
Genomic SEM to identify mechanistic correlates of shared genetic variance for SLD-traits that frequently co-
occur, implicating transdiagnostic genetic risk pathways. These mechanistic correlates are with functional data
developed in our lab, in collaboration with other labs, and from open-source consortiums (e.g., GETex,
ENCODE). These include gene-expression datasets from brain tissue, developing neurons, and organoids
(transcriptome), methylation datasets (epigenome) and regulatory pathways (regulome), and fMRI imaging
data (brain connectome). Mechanistic correlates will identify pleiotropic effects that transcend diagnostic
categories and offer new ways to understand SLDs and their neurodevelopmental underpinnings. In Aim 3 we
propose to perform a multivariate GWAS of SLDs to identify pleiotropic genetic variants. This will categorize
SLD-associated genetic variants as either pleiotropic or disorder-specific. SLD-associated genetic variants that
are pleiotropic could partially account for comorbidity. We will also analyze longitudinal data to show whether
the genetic components that underlie achievement at a single time point are distinct from those important for
growth over time, both of which are vital aspects of academic success.
Completion of this project will identify mechanisms that improve our understanding of comorbidity, inform
bottom-up revisions of the classification system for SLDs, and enhance the current nosology."
10931731,"Project V Summary
 Consistent with RFA HD-23-022, Project V will examine the efficacy of engagement approaches to
meet the needs of children with specific learning disabilities (SLDs) and their families. Currently, there are
significant practical challenges in youth with SLDs accessing initial neuropsychological assessments, barriers
to pursuing services and supports even when youth do receive assessment, and high levels of anxiety in youth
with SLDs that remain unaddressed by extant evidence-based interventions. Further, there are notable
disparities in care, with need most pronounced in youth from under-represented groups (URGs), including
individuals from lower socioeconomic status. The goal of Project V is to work bidirectionally with families and
community stakeholders to develop, implement, and evaluate efforts to best support the assessment and
intervention needs of children with SLDs and related disorders. Project V proposes two related aims. Aim 1
will examine the experiences of families during neuropsychological assessments, as well as one year
later in order to assess acceptability and feasibility of assessment recommendations, including barriers to
pursuit of services (N=600). Both quantitative and qualitative methods will be used, with multi-method analyses
to examine experiences, barriers, and service use as predicting short- and long-term outcomes for youth with
SLDs. To address the unmet needs of youth with SLDs and co-occurring anxiety, Aim 2 will test the
feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of a brief six-session, group-based anxiety intervention
tailored to youth with SLDs (N=80). The intervention will be adapted from the well-elaborated youth anxiety
treatment literature and preliminary studies of anxiety treatment in the SLD context. A time-varying multiple
baseline design will be used so that youth are their own controls and all eligible youth have intervention access
(as opposed to a no-treatment or usual care control). Both aims will utilize focus groups to obtain qualitative
data on family experiences to improve the assessment and recommendations process (Aim 1) and to
iteratively improve the anxiety intervention (Aim 2). Both aims will also prioritize enrollment of youth from lower
socioeconomic backgrounds as evidenced by receipt of financial assistance for their neuropsychological
intervention. Together, these aims will address the primary unmet needs we have identified across SLD
assessment and intervention, including barriers to accessing evidence-based neuropsychological assessments
and implementing resulting recommendations, and a lack of mental health interventions that address the
specific needs of youth with SLDs. Both aims include explicit opportunities for bidirectional engagement
between the research team and families, consistent with principles of community-engaged research."

 Overall, this program will develop a variety of new metal-catalyzed synthetic methods for the construction
and late-stage diversification of biologically relevant molecules. The proposed work encompasses many different
types of chemical reactions but is unified by two central themes. First, it focuses on developing transformations
that provide access to new chemical space and/or that streamline the synthesis of existing structures. Second,
the proposed efforts are guided by detailed mechanistic analysis and organometallic chemistry.
 A first project continues the Sanford group's long-standing efforts in developing new approaches to carbon–
hydrogen bond functionalization. The traditional approach in this area focuses on the discovery of highly selective
reactions, in which the catalyst, substrate, and reaction conditions are tailored to convert a single, specific C–H
bond into a new functional group. While successful, this approach is limited by a disproportionate focus on
relatively simple substrates that contain only one “reactive” C–H site. The proposed efforts will contribute to
shifting this paradigm by targeting reactions in which a single starting material is converted into multiple C–H
functionalization products. This will provide access to new structures that are of high interest in medicinal
chemistry. Additionally, it will provide a wealth of mechanistic data about the factors responsible for reactivity
and selectivity that will be used to drive next-generation catalyst design and new reaction discovery.
 A second project will target the development of new metal-catalyzed cross coupling reactions. Notably, cross-
coupling is among the most widely used transformations in organic synthesis. The proposed efforts present a
unified approach to target three central challenges associated with modern cross-coupling methods: (1) the use
of abundant carboxylic acid-derived electrophiles as coupling partners; (2) elimination of the requirement for
added base; and (3) the invention of reactions that form new types of bonds, with a focus on introducing fluorine-
containing functional groups that are of high value in medicinal chemistry. All three goals will be accomplished
in an integrated fashion via a common mechanistic foundation.
 A third project leverages the Sanford group's expertise in organometallic chemistry, mechanistic analysis,
and catalytic reaction development to identify and tackle an emerging challenge in organic synthesis. SF5-
substituted (hetero)aromatic rings are gaining increasing prominence as entities for integration into drug
candidates. However, despite the growing significance of this functional group, synthetic methods for accessing
aryl–SF5 derivatives remain extremely limited. This proposal outlines fundamental studies of the synthesis and
reactivity of metal–SF5 complexes (species that are currently unprecedented). These studies will then be used
to drive the development of catalytic aryl–SF5 coupling reactions."

added base; and (3) the invention of reactions that form new types of bonds, with a focus on introducing fluorine-
containing functional groups that are of high value in medicinal chemistry. All three goals will be accomplished
in an integrated fashion via a common mechanistic foundation.
 A third project leverages the Sanford group's expertise in organometallic chemistry, mechanistic analysis,
and catalytic reaction development to identify and tackle an emerging challenge in organic synthesis. SF5-
substituted (hetero)aromatic rings are gaining increasing prominence as entities for integration into drug
candidates. However, despite the growing significance of this functional group, synthetic methods for accessing
aryl–SF5 derivatives remain extremely limited. This proposal outlines fundamental studies of the synthesis and
reactivity of metal–SF5 complexes (species that are currently unprecedented). These studies will then be used
to drive the development of catalytic aryl–SF5 coupling reactions."
10757925,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects about 4.2% (or 14.1 million) of American adults each year and causes
substantial morbidity and mortality. While genetic variation can influence an individual's vulnerability to AUD,
chronic alcohol consumption can also lead to alcohol tolerance and dependence, but the underlying mechanism
is unclear. There is evidence that that chronic alcohol use alters DNA methylation of specific genes, leading to
gene expression changes and possibly an increased risk of AUD. RNA methylation is a common post-
transcriptional modification, and it responds rapidly to a variety of stimuli and translates stimulatory signals into
cellular activity. We hypothesize that alcohol use alters an individual's RNA methylome (or epitranscriptome),
resulting in altered expression of genes involved in AUD-related pathways. The objective of this research is to
explore messenger RNA (mRNA) methylomic changes in the brain of AUD subjects and analyze the effect of
mRNA methylation on mRNA expression and neuronal activity, thus providing evidence for a new gene
expression regulatory mechanism of AUD. To achieve this goal, we propose three specific aims. First, we will
profile mRNA methylomic and transcriptomic changes in eight regions (amygdala, caudate, cerebellum,
hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, putamen, and ventral tegmental area) of postmortem
brains of AUD subjects. Second, we will use chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE)-exposed mice as models to verify
AUD-associated brain mRNA methylation and expression changes as well as the correlation of ethanol
exposure-induced mRNA methylation and expression changes with the escalation of ethanol self-administration
in mice. Third, we will employ a novel epitranscriptome editing approach to investigate the effect of AUD-
associated mRNA methylation changes on mRNA expression and neuronal activity. We expect to (1) observe
AUD-associated mRNA methylation and expression changes in specific (or across) brain regions; (2) verify AUD-
associated mRNA methylation and expression changes by mouse modeling; and (3) confirm the functional role
of AUD-associated mRNA methylation in regulating mRNA expression and neuronal activity. Our study design
is innovative. AUD-associated mRNA methylation changes will be examined at single-base resolution. An
integrative study approach (human postmortem brain studies, mouse modeling, and epitranscriptome editing)
will be employed. The proposed research will provide evidence about the influence of brain epitranscriptomic
changes on AUD risk. Given that mRNA methylation is dynamic and reversible, mRNAs with differential
methylation in the brain of AUD subjects could be potential targets for AUD treatment by pharmacologically
altering mRNA methylation status."
10757928,"Black Americans demonstrably suffer from a range of health disparities rising from a long history of
structural inequities and racism. Although Black Americans are slightly less likely to drink alcohol than the
general population, the rate of Black drinkers with alcohol use disorders (AUD) is comparable, representing 1.5
million Black Americans with AUD. Blacks suffer more negative consequences due to alcohol use such as
illnesses, injuries, criminal-legal involvement, and social problems. Recovery is a dynamic process of behavior
change leading to stable improvements in functioning, purpose and well-being. NIAAA further highlights
recovery as remission from AUD symptoms as well as cessation of heavy drinking. Recovery support services
and recovery community organizations aim to build recovery capital. Yet, to date little effort has been made to
consider recovery within population groups rather than across groups. A “centering in the margins” approach
emphasizes the need to examine experiences of racialized and minoritized populations. This proposed study to
advance recovery pathways and support services for Black men and women heeds that call. It is directly
responsive to RFA-AA-21-001 in its emphasis on health disparities in AUD populations, intersecting with the
RFA goals to advance culturally-informed measures and interventions, increase access to AUD services, make
services more appealing, and evaluate evidence-based practices. We do this with a focus on Black men and
women in AUD recovery. We thus aim to iteratively use quantitative and qualitative methods to capture and
assess questions related to AUD recovery in a heterogenous Black population, in partnership with a Black-
majority recovery community organization in Detroit. Specifically: (1) Use qualitative methods with a Black
population to (a) define AUD recovery pathways; (b) assess and refine a measure of recovery domains (e.g.,
relationships, living environment); and (c) identify and map community indicators that may facilitate or interfere
with AUD recovery. (2) Use quantitative methods to describe and assess the provision of AUD recovery
support services provided by the recovery community organization in terms of matching to needs, stage of
recovery and other client and community characteristics, by race/ethnicity. (3) Conduct a pragmatic
randomized controlled trial that builds on Aims 1 and 2 with a Black AUD recovery population, compared to a
treatment as usual group with in-person recovery support services, to determine the effectiveness of an added
phone+digital recovery support service intervention (i.e., provision of smartphones and guidance/support for
online recovery activities). The proposed study will enable a deep understanding of what recovery means to
Black men and women, how it can be measured, and how we can advance recovery journeys of Black
Americans with AUD. The results will be meaningful to Black individuals themselves, providers who treat
Blacks who have AUD, and to researchers and policymakers who need to better understand the meaning and
needs of a heterogenous US population."
10916440,"Project Summary/Abstract
Obesity-mediated insulin resistance is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D), which accounts for ~90% of all
diabetes. Despite many drugs that are available to treat T2D, there is no FDA-approved drug that directly
works on the insulin receptor (IR) to overcome insulin resistance. Recent studies show that galectin-3 (Gal3)
can bind directly to the IR and inhibit downstream IR signaling causing insulin resistance and impaired glucose
tolerance in obesity-induced T2D. Our scientific premise is that we have developed a very potent Gal3
antagonist, TFD100, from a natural dietary source. The primary objective of this Phase II proposal is to
complete the preclinical studies required for our IND submission to the FDA to enable the initiation of a first–in–
human Phase 1 clinical trial. Successful completion of our proposed aims will achieve a significant value
inflection point for the company, positioning us well for either partnering or a capital raise.
 The proposed research embodies technological innovation in two areas: 1) This will be the first FDA-
approved biologic therapeutics based on a natural carbohydrate compound; 2) TFD100’s picomolar affinity
to Gal3 has many advantages including overcoming the common saturation issue related to antigenicity. An
anticipated corollary benefit of the proposed studies includes the elucidation of novel lectin-mediated molecular
mechanisms of cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions that modulate IR signaling in T2D. This
knowledge will be fundamental to opening-up new carbohydrate-based approaches to T2D treatments.
 We have successfully completed Phase 1 studies. In studies with cells, Gal3 inhibited IR/IRS-1 activation,
which was reversed by TFD100. In high fat diet (HFD) animal model, TFD100 treatment significantly improved
glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance compared to the vehicle-treated animals. After analyzing our results,
we are excited to continue our drug development. TFD100 is a biologic drug and we believe that TFD100 will
likely be distributed as a solution in the prefilled cartridge to be taken by T2D patients at home similar to non-
invasive SC injection of insulin or Ozempic. To enhance the scientific rigor, we plan to ascertain SC
administered TFD100’s ability to treat T2D in HFD model, and to complete relevant IND-enabling experiments
in the following specific aims: 1) Determine PK/PD of TFD100; 2) Ascertain efficacy of SC administered
TFD100 to treat HFD induced obesity, insulin resistance and T2D, and 3) GLP production of TFD100 for
future toxicology studies. The proposed activities will be either performed by expert contractual collaborators
or will be guided by an exceptional consultant team with specialized industry expertise in biologics product
development, regulation, and clinical development. The outcomes of these studies will lead to the submission
of IND to the FDA followed by a Phase 1 clinical trial."
10760305,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Checkpoint blockade has had tremendous impact on cancer therapy, but only
a subset of patients respond. While non-response may be due to lack of tumor-associated antigen
(TAA), our group and others have shown that –as important as having TAA– is the immune system’s
capacity to present TAA on antigen presenting cells, specifically a subset of ‘cross-presenting’ Batf3-
expressing dendritic cells (DC). Without Batf3-DC, anti-tumor effects of PD1 blockade are lost.
Therefore we hypothesize that increasing cross-priming DC will improve the efficacy of PD1 blockade.
 To increase cross-priming, we developed an in situ vaccination (ISV) combining (i) Flt3L, to recruit
DC (ii) radiotherapy (XRT) to load DC with TAA, and (iii) a TLR agonist to activate the TAA-loaded DCs.
We tested this novel ISV (Flt3L/XRT/polyIC) in advanced stage lymphoma patients and observed
dramatic systemic remissions in some patients. To improve the ISV, we developed a murine ISV model
which recapitulated the clinical findings and also increased cure rates of PD1 blockade from 0% to
~75%, which prompted a new trial, using ISV plus pembrolizumab, opened in 02/19.
 Still, the unmet clinical need is great, to understand and improve upon our ISV and PD1 blockade,
we will develop methods to measure cross-priming, using sophisticated mouse models (Aim 1) and
deep immune monitoring of patient samples from the two trials (Aim 2,3).
 In Aim 1, we will determine how ISV enhances PD1 blockade in mouse models in which we preserve
only cross-priming or only direct-priming (by the tumor) or both. Specifically, we will: (a) determine if
cross-priming is necessary for ISV anti-tumor effects (b) define a signature of cross-primed T cells,
including their expression of checkpoint molecules, and (c) characterize resistance mechanisms.
 In Aim 2, we will demonstrate that ISV cross-primes patients’ tumor-reactive T cells by analyzing
banked samples from our ISV-treated patients. Specifically, we will: (a) use ex vivo autologous tumor:T
cell co-cultures, flow-sorting, and immunoSEQ to identify anti-tumor T cells, and (b) use 5’ scRNAseq/
TCRseq to quantify and characterize those T cells and then correlate them with clinical responses.
 In Aim 3, we will analyze banked samples from our ongoing ISV plus pembrolizumab trial which also
includes administration of a surrogate Ag at the ISV site. Specifically, we will: (a) assess whether
surrogate Ag cross-presentation is improved by ISV and PD1 blockade and whether it predicts clinical
outcomes, and (b) determine mechanisms of tumoral suppression of cross-priming.
 Lymphomas kill ~21,000 patients annually in the U.S. The most common lymphomas are incurable
with standard therapies and minimally responsive to checkpoint blockade. Improving our understanding
of ISV and PD1 blockade will improve their efficacy, and thereby improve the lives of our patients."

In this application, we propose to continue our training program to achieve a critical mass of
researchers in Bolivia, where we are building local expertise. We will employ a successful progressive
stepwise method of selecting and training young investigators in Bolivia. This stepwise training method permits
screening of candidates at multiple levels and ensures that we invest in the most highly qualified and motivated
individuals. The proximity of Bolivia to Peru provides us with a unique opportunity to leverage the human
capacity and infrastructure that we have built in Peru over the last 25 years, using a South-South training
approach to more cost-effectively begin to build a scientific research community in Bolivia.1 Several infectious
diseases affect public health in Bolivia, and we plan to focus our training on a few of the most important to the
country: Chagas disease, cysticercosis, tuberculosis (TB), pneumonia, and HIV neurological co-infections.
Over the past 25 years, we have developed a training network of developing and developed country institutions
that is remarkable for its breadth, depth, and sustainability. This program began with a focus on Peru and has
trained more than 95 Peruvian graduate and post-graduate students and 500 students of other nationalities.
The collaborative network of individuals and institutions tied to this grant has produced more than 500 original
research articles in peer-reviewed journals. This network and infrastructure developed in our original program
in Peru was used as the model to train researchers in Bolivia. We will continue the South-South training
approach used in the first five years of the program to train researchers in Bolivia.
We have the following steps in our program that will be completed under this D43 grant:
Step 1. We will train 20+ students each year in infectious disease and research methods seminars in Bolivia,
for a total of 100+ students during the five-year grant.
Step 2. We will train four students per year in laboratory rotations at the UPCH, for a total of 20 trainees during
the 5-year grant.
Step 3. We will train six students per year in laboratory rotations in Bolivia, for a total of 30 trainees during the
5-year grant.
Step 4. We will train two Bolivian students per year in a master’s degree program at UPCH, for a total of ten
trainees during the five-year grant.
Step 5. We will support 10 Bolivian students to attend the Tropical Medicine and Public Health Summer
Institute at JHSPH during the five-year grant.
Step 6. Four Ph.D. candidates at USA or U.K during the five-year grant."
10760327,"Project Summary
Large data sets are important in the development and evaluation of artificial intelligence (AI) and
statistical learning models to predict morbidity, mortality, and other important health outcomes.
Healthcare institutions are stewards of their patients’ data, and want to contribute to the
development, evaluation, and utilization of predictive analytics tools. However, they also know
that simple “de-identification” per HIPAA rules is not sufficient to protect patient privacy.
Additionally, other factors such as protection of market share, lack of control about who uses
shared data for what purposes, and concerns about patients’ reactions to having their data shared
without explicit consent make initiatives such as certain registries and centralized repositories
difficult to implement. We have shown that it is possible to decompose algorithms so that they
can run on data that stays at each healthcare center, thus mitigating the concerns about control
and potential misuse. In the first phase of this project, we concentrated on demonstrating the
accuracy and performance of these algorithms for the study of chronic diseases in which (1)
acquisition of new knowledge about the condition is slow (i.e., the disease is well understood, so
scientific discoveries are not being published at a rapid pace); and (2) the incidence and
presentation of the disease do not vary dramatically from place to place, and from person to
person. In this competitive renewal, we propose to develop decentralized predictive models that
meet all requirements for chronic diseases, but the methods are also applicable to rapidly evolving
acute conditions such as COVID-19. We propose new approaches to deal with sites that may be
missing certain patient profiles or certain variables but can still participate in model learning,
evaluation and implementation. These new AI algorithms will permit supervised and unsupervised
learning across institutions, using data from multiple modalities (e.g., imaging, genomes,
laboratory tests), and will allow privacy-protecting record linkage. We will test these algorithms
and approaches in data from three highly diverse medical centers across the US: Emory
University in Atlanta, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and University of
California, San Diego."
10760328,"Visual working memory plays a fundamental role in visual perception and visually guided behavior, and
much has been learned about the nature of this memory system by studies using arrays of artificial but easily
controlled stimuli (e.g., arrays of colored disks or oriented Gabor patches). However, current quantitative
models of visual working memory based on these artificial stimuli cannot be readily extended to the kinds of
complex, structured scenes that humans face in daily life. The central goal of the proposed research is to
develop and test a new quantitative approach to understanding the representation of complex objects and
scenes in working memory, which will lead to a better understanding of real-world vision.
 In our model, a scene is represented in visual working memory as a noisier version of the pattern of
activation that was produced during the perception of that scene. We model this by feeding the scene into a
neural network model of the ventral object recognition pathway and using the resulting pattern of activation
across the population of units (the population vector) as a model of the working memory representation. We
then use this model to make predictions about both behavioral performance and neural activity in human
subjects. For example, the change detection task involves presenting a sample scene followed after delay by a
test scene and asking subjects to report whether the two scenes are the same or different. We can model this
task by feeding the sample and test scenes into the model and computing the distance between the population
vectors for the sample and test scenes. In our preliminary data, we find that the distance between the vectors
can predict behavioral change detection performance extremely well. Moreover, we find that the vector for the
sample scene can predict the pattern of neural activity during the delay between the sample and test scenes
(measured via event-related potentials). Note that previous quantitative models of visual working memory
cannot make any predictions at all for the natural scenes used in these preliminary studies.
 We propose testing and extending this model in several ways. First, we will conduct several experiments to
assess the ability of the model to predict behavioral performance and neural activity across a broad range of
natural stimuli. Second, we will compare the ability of population vectors from different cortical regions (as
estimated from the model and from fMRI data) to predict behavioral performance and delay-period activity,
providing new insights into the specific brain regions that underlie visual working memory. Third, we will
determine whether our model can predict performance in visually guided tasks (e.g., visual search) that rely on
visual working memory. Finally, we will assess different versions of our model that implement competing
mechanisms for producing capacity limitations, and we will compare the ability of these models to account for
behavioral performance for both natural scenes and classic examples of artificial stimuli. Together, these
experiments will provide a new and broader understanding of visual working memory."
10923984,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY
We propose conducting clinical Phase I trials on an active IND (157314), AFA-281, a non-opioid, single small
molecule that inhibits both T-type Cav3 calcium channels and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to treat chronic
neuropathic pain. Millions of Americans suffer from chronic pain, especially neuropathic and inflammatory types.
Yet less than 50% of patients respond to current treatments, leading to increased reliance on opioids.
There is strong rationale to target Cav3 and sEH jointly. Tissue and nerve injury trigger inflammation, which
increases neuronal hyperexcitability. This increases activation of the Cav3.2 channel subtype in the sensory
nervous system, exacerbating pain and touch sensitivity. Cav3.2 upregulation and overactivation were observed
in human patients with chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and
osteoarthritis (OA), with similar findings in animals. In addition, sEH breaks down the body’s anti-inflammatory
mediators, epoxy-fatty acids (EpFAs), into inflammatory diols. sEH is involved in inflammatory OA pain and IBS
visceral pain in humans. Single sEH inhibitors mitigate inflammatory and neuropathic pain in animals.
Therefore, a single drug inhibiting both Cav3.2 and sEH could produce complementary analgesia and anti-
inflammatory effects. As a dual-inhibitor fitting this profile, AFA-281 could improve the patient experience by
reducing polypharmacy, pill burden, medication nonadherence, dose-limiting side effects, and drug-drug
interactions. AFA-281 potently inhibits both Cav3.2 and sEH, whereas it causes 50- to 500-fold weaker inhibition
against 81 off-targets tested. AFA-281 produces significant analgesia and reduction of brain microglia activation
in a neuropathic pain model of spared nerve injury (SNI) in rats. GLP safety pharmacology, toxicity, and
genotoxicity studies indicate AFA-281 has no cardiac toxicity concerns and is a safe drug meriting first-in-human
studies. The FDA thoroughly reviewed our IND application and determined ""IND 157314 Study may proceed"" on
November 11, 2022. Therefore, we propose conducting clinical Phase I trials with three Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Phase I Part 1: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of single ascending doses (SAD) of oral AFA-
281 in healthy volunteers will investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of AFA-281.
Aim 2. Phase I Part 2: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of multiple ascending doses (MAD) of oral AFA-
281 in healthy volunteers will characterize the safety and PK for up to 14 days of dosing.
Aim 3. Explore target engagement during the Part 2 MAD trial. In vivo sEH inhibition will be measured by plasma
EpFA/diol ratio increases. Electroencephalogram/electromyography (EEG/EMG) will be used to assess Cav3
channel engagement, as EEG changes by a Cav3 blocker have been reported in human and rodent EEG.
Phase I trial success by achieving the primary safety objective can advance AFA-281 to proof-of-concept studies
on neuropathic pain in Phase II trials. Ultimately, an effective and safe, non-opioid, non-NSAID and non-addictive
analgesic will provide an alternative for neuropathic pain treatment and help end the opioid crisis."
10766264,"Soil-transmitted helminth or soil-transmitted nematode (STN) infections are intestinal parasitic
nematodes, mainly Ascaris, hookworms, and whipworms. They are amongst the most prevalent parasites
on earth and cause severe morbidity in children, including growth stunting, intellectual and educational
impairment, malnutrition, anemia, and lower future earning; they also have significant impacts on
pregnant women and worker productivity. Single dose mass drug administration (MDA) to treat STNs
relies on a single drug class, the benzimidazoles (BZs). BZs have poor efficacy against whipworms and
highly variable efficacy against hookworms. BZ resistance alleles have been detected in STNs and there are
clear examples of low BZ efficacy against all parasites. New mechanism-of-action and broadly potent
therapies for STNs are urgently needed. However, high throughput screening (HTS) platforms using STN
parasites have not been developed to date, which would greatly facilitate drug discovery. Here, a new
pipeline for STN drug discovery using two highly divergent STN parasites is described and validated, as is a
new HTS platform that is incorporated at the beginning of the pipeline (Z factor 0.53). The overall
objective of this application is to identify safe compounds that can broadly target STN parasites by applying
this new HTS platform and pipeline. Two high-quality and well-characterized libraries containing 21,153
compounds will be screened. Actives (~1800 predicted) from this HTS will be down-selected by screening
against adult Ancylostoma ceylanicum hookworm adult parasites and against Trichuris muris whipworm
adult parasites, both which are highly relevant for human STN drug discovery. Compounds that are dually
active against these divergent parasites will be further prioritized by data mining/chemoinformatics,
mammalian cell toxicity studies, BZ-resistant hookworm assays, as well as in vitro dose-response studies
against adult parasites from both species. The top 10-20 actives from these studies will be tested in rodents
for in vivo deworming efficacy against genuine parasitic infections. Following these studies, in vivo
pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, focused library and Structure-Activity-Relationship studies, and initial
mechanism of action (MoA) studies will be carried out. This research will lay the groundwork for more
detailed follow up studies for future applications. After successful execution of this proposed research plan,
we expect to have identified 1-4 new, broadly active anti-STN compounds (anthelmintics) primed for future
pre-clinical and clinical studies."

former Clinical and Translational Sciences Award summer research program. First offered in 2007, our former
program provided a participatory experience in translational research to students in master's degree and health
professions degree programs to ignite their passion for research. Each year the program attracted participants
from across the United States and territories with diverse research interests and backgrounds. The new
MICHR-TSI will improve upon our former program by 1) expanding our connections with minority-serving
institutions, 2) providing a structured, full-time 10-week (400-hour) research experience with intentional training
in translational science and best practices for conducting rigorous and responsible research, 3) providing an
optional additional 200 hours (part-time) of training to complete a research project and disseminate research
results, 4) expanding the areas of training focus, and 5) providing mentors with structured mentorship and
team science training including participation in MICHR's new Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accountable
Leadership in Clinical and Translational Science Initiative (IDEAL-CTS). Eligible program candidates will
include pre-doctoral graduate students and professional degree students within the first two years of their
program of study as well as undergraduate rising seniors. Key to this new R25 program is multi-level mentoring
and hands-on research experience designed to expose participants to research practice and inspire them to
pursue further training focused on translational science and its role in eliminating health disparities and
improving health care quality. We will accomplish our goals through the following aims: 1) Provide MICHR-TSI
participants with translational research experiences and translational science instruction to facilitate precision
preparation which includes obtaining a translational science certificate; 2) Equip MICHR-TSI participants with
enhanced scientific social networks to help refine and fuel their translational research engagement; 3) Develop
MICHR-TSI participants who are versatile communicators to advance their evolving careers through enhanced
dissemination of their work. The MICHR-TSI program will provide greater training inlets to MICHR and U-M, so
we can build and retain a strong pipeline of next-generation translational researchers."

Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), such as preterm birth and low birth weight, are a major, costly health
problem[1, 2]. Compared to the United States overall, significantly higher rates of preterm birth exist in Puerto
Rico, where nearly 11.4% of all births in 2017 are preterm. Rates of low birth weight in Puerto Rico are likewise
much higher than the U.S. average. Evidence exists that exposure to Superfund chemicals contributes to
APOs. Established in 2010, the Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats Center (PROTECT)
uses a holistic system of research, training and stakeholder engagement to study transport, exposure, health
impact and remediation of contaminants. The focus in this submission is to study the impact of specific
mixtures of environmental contaminants on APOs. The set of mixtures selected for study are environmental
agents with potential for adverse health effect in the prenatal period and are consistently found in PROTECT
participants. The Human Subjects and Sampling Core (HSSC) provides a single point of contact to obtain data
and biological and environmental samples linked to human subjects. For this renewal, the HSSC will maintain
and enhance the infrastructure needed to recruit pregnant women from the northern karst region of Puerto
Rico to participate in the program’s longitudinal research (Aim 1). The HSSC will build on the experience of
partners from the University of Puerto Rico School of Public Health and the University of Georgia, who have
recruited cohorts of pregnant women for diverse studies over the last decade. In the current funding period,
HSSC formed and trained a team of nurses, physicians, support staff and graduate students that recruited and
retained 1457 pregnant women with over 1280 followed until they completed pregnancy (including 1210 live
births.) The intent of the proposed renewal is to recruit an additional 1000 participants, ultimately yielding a
cohort of over 2,000 complete births. In addition to recruiting, the HSSC will systematically collect and share
multiple sources of data. To acquire detailed information on potential predictors of APOs, the HSSC will
conduct sequential interviews with study subjects, abstract medical records, and collect biological and
environmental samples during pregnancy, delivery and postpartum (Aim 2). Because many of the projects
have the same data or sample needs, a single systematic process for collection and sharing data and samples
avoids duplication of effort and decreases the contact time with study subjects. This is a better use of time and
available resources and reduces participant burden. The HSSC will process, archive and distribute samples to
project investigators, and in collaboration with the Data Management and Analysis Core, maintain a repository
of samples with an integrated database (Aim 3)."
10767796,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Polypharmacology, or concurrent engagement of multiple molecular targets, is a common feature
of the most prevalent classes of therapeutics for treating disorders of the central nervous system,
including antidepressants. To date, the identification of scaffolds with desirable
polypharmacologic activity has relied on a largely unguided, phenotypically-driven approach,
since there are few techniques for matching a discrete desired or undesired outcome with a
specific pattern of concurrent action at multiple targets. Nevertheless, accessing the mechanistic
understanding offered by such a systems pharmacology approach is a fundamental priority if the
rational design of multi-target psychiatric therapeutics is ever to become a reality. Therefore, the
long-term objective of this line of work is to develop and validate antibody-mediated and
combinatorial neuronal ensemble tagging chemical neuroscience methods as complementary
means to identify and manipulate targetable polypharmacologic phenomena across molecular,
cellular, and behavioral levels. More immediately, this project aims to use incremental vaccination
against small molecule therapeutics to identify whether (R,S)-ketamine and (2R,6R)-
hydroxynorketamine act on differential glutamatergic targets in a temporally coordinated manner
to reduce the expression of anhedonia and behavioral despair in a rapid, yet persistent, manner.
Furthermore, it aims to use neuronal ensemble activation, tagging, and ablation in the presence
of single or multiple chemical species arising from (R,S)-ketamine administration. This will allow
for identification of emergent cellular-level effects due to polypharmacologic engagement. Overall,
this project will not only provide needed clarity regarding how (R,S)-ketamine and (2R,6R)-
hydroxynorketamine interact to support treatment of major depressive disorder, but will also
identify potential mechanistic means to separate the abuse liability of rapidly-acting glutamatergic
antidepressants from their therapeutic effects."
10767797,"An increasing number of adults in the U.S. develop acute respiratory failure (ARF) requiring mechanical
ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). To improve patient outcomes, evidence-based guidelines
recommend titrating sedatives to allow for patient wakefulness while in the ICU. However, among awake ARF
patients, anxiety can be a common and long-lasting problem. Outside of the ICU setting, self-management
interventions are established, evidence-based, first-line treatments for patients with anxiety. However, there is
limited evidence about the feasibility and benefit of self-management interventions for ARF patients during
hospitalization. Hence, this K23 proposal seeks to: 1) conduct a qualitative study in hospitalized patients to
refine an existing Self-Management in Acute Respiratory Failure (SMARF) intervention (Aim 1), and 2) conduct
a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the refined SMARF intervention vs. usual care in the ICU and wards
to establish its feasibility, acceptability (primary outcome; Aim 2a), and potential efficacy in reducing anxiety
symptoms and associated outcomes at hospital discharge (Aim 2b) and at 3-month follow-up (secondary
outcomes; Aim 3).
 Megan Hosey, PhD, a practicing clinical psychologist and Assistant Professor at the Johns Hopkins
School of Medicine, has a long-term career goal of becoming an independent, patient-oriented researcher in
acute respiratory failure, examining early interventions to reduce psychological symptoms and improve long-
term functional outcomes. Through this K23 award, Dr. Hosey will achieve the following career goals: 1) gain
expertise in qualitative research via didactic coursework and mentored practical experience, 2) deepen
knowledge and experience in patient-oriented research by completing a Master of Health Science (MHS)
degree in Clinical Investigation and conducting a pilot RCT, and 3) gain mentored experience with scientific
publication and grant writing. This award will result in preliminary data and skills that will lay the foundation for
a successful future R-level grant and pathway towards independent investigator status. This award will build
upon Dr. Hosey’s extensive clinical expertise in self-management interventions for ARF patients and her
research background in the psychosocial aspects of recovery from ARF via providing tailored didactic training
and mentored research experience with a world-class team, all occurring in a resource-rich academic
environment."

a functional ‘wiring diagram’ of a eukaryotic cell. In the context of the last funding cycle, we systematically analyzed how
the global yeast genetic interaction network responds to different conditions, and we discovered that it is remarkably robust
to environmental perturbation. On the other hand, our systematic analysis of trigenic interactions associated with triple
mutants and genetic interactions involving natural variants revealed the prevalence of complex genetic interactions and their
immense potential to modify phenotype. To explore gene function and genetic networks in human cells, we also established
an efficient genome-wide CRSPR-Cas9 platform for mapping genetic interactions, and we constructed a ‘scaffold’ genetic
network for a reference human cell line. Like the yeast genetic network, the topology of the human network is informative
of gene function and suggests that general properties of genetic networks are highly conserved.
Here, we propose continued systematic analysis of complex genetic interaction networks and phenotypes in yeast, and the
application of the results for the cogent design of experiments to continue mapping genetic networks in human cells.
Aim 1: Conditional phenotypes and genetic networks dynamics in the context of diverse genetic backgrounds. We
will perform systematic phenotypic and genetic analyses in wild, genetically diverse yeast strains to identify genetic
modifiers underlying background-specific gene essentiality. We will also map genetic interactions in wild yeast isolates to
quantify the effect of genetic background on genetic networks and more generally, the genotype-phenotype relationship.
Aim 2: Quantitative single cell read-outs for assaying the phenotypic consequences of genetic variation. We will
produce quantitative cell biological phenotypic profiles associated with gene perturbation and explore the influence of cell
state on the effects of genetic perturbation, using proteome dynamics as a phenotypic read-out. These projects will map
genetic determinants of subcellular morphology, reveal connections between conserved compartments, and establish
methods to use the proteome as a read-out for genotype-phenotype analysis.
Aim 3: Mapping a global genetic interaction network for a human cell line. Based on our current human genetic
interaction dataset, we will select and screen an informative set of query gene mutants, with an emphasis on essential genes,
to expand our scaffold genetic network and efficiently map networks underlying a set of functionally representative protein
complexes. This network will provide a powerful resource for annotating human gene function and identify conserved
network properties that can be used to discover disease gene modifiers, including those underlying cancer cell genetic
dependencies."
10767800,"Project Summary
Hispanic youth are nearly three times more likely to be at high risk for developmental, behavioral, or social
delays compared to white non-Hispanic children. Contributing to this risk disparity is disproportionate rates of
Hispanic children living in poverty and heightened risk for exposure to early-life environmental adversity, all of
which confers substantial risk for the development of psychopathology and a lifelong risk for chronic diseases.
A critical process by which disproportionate experiences of early adversity might influence risk for the
development of later psychopathology is through the biological embedding of adversity exposure via epigenetic
changes in genes involved in neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses to stress response. Despite
promise and progress of social epigenomic research on risk processes, a significant limitation of the extant
literature is that a basic understanding of how biological embedding of adversity can be prevented or reversed
has yet to be achieved, with little knowledge of the role of protective factors that impact these developmental
trajectories. In fact, prior work in humans has been almost exclusively cross-sectional and focused on
detrimental environmental impacts, greatly constraining our understanding of epigenomic processes over time
and its positive malleability to interventions. The proposed research will leverage an on-going NIH-funded R01
(#HD084497) to evaluate, via a randomized controlled trial of a home-based behavioral parent training
intervention, how changing social context (i.e., dysfunctional parenting) alters the epigenome among at-risk
Hispanic preschoolers and potentially establishes a biological foundation that promotes resiliency and
potentially ameliorates the biological embedding of adversity. In the current proposal, we propose to use a
balanced analytical approach that includes (1) a hypothesis-driven pathway analyses for genes involved in
neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses to stress, (2) a targeted design that pulls sites previously
identified in well-powered EWAS studies to create poly-epigenetic risk scores, and (3) a hypothesis-free
epigenome-wide association study. In addition to examining trajectories of change in child DNA methylation,
we will determine if exposure to a protective factor (positive parenting) buffers the impact of adversity on
biomarkers of accelerated aging during a sensitive developmental stage. Lastly, we will explore epigenomic
biosignatures of response to early intervention based on both child and parent DNA methylation. For all aims,
we will use a multi-informant, multi-method design that includes observations of parenting, task-based
measures of child self-regulation, standardized assessments of child developmental and clinical outcomes,
independent clinical evaluators, and both child and parent DNA methylation. This research will facilitate the
application of precision medicine and prevention approaches by identifying epigenomic biomarkers of early
intervention response patterns that will allow for innovative strategies in risk identification and personalized
prevention, together resulting in a new understanding of effective approaches to reducing health disparities."
10768147,"Genetic Mechanisms Program Summary
The Genetic Mechanisms (GM) Program is a basic science program that focuses on cancer gene discovery,
mechanisms of genome instability, and gene therapy. The scientific goals of GM are to define and understand
the genetic changes that occur during cancer development, including the specific changes that drive tumor
initiation, progression, and drug resistance, and to translate our basic science discoveries into preclinical
pipelines. We will continue to focus on areas where we have made significant progress over the last 5 years,
including studies on the discovery of DNA damage tolerance pathways that can lead to drug resistance in
repair-deficient cancers, repurposing of existing drugs for cancer therapy, and adoptive immunotherapy with
genome-engineered cells and viruses. These larger goals are underpinned by the following Specific Aims: 1)
Identify cancer vulnerabilities, 2) Understand cancer genome evolution, and 3) Develop viral & cellular
therapies.
The GM Program is co-led by Masato Yamamoto, MD, PhD, a clinician-scientist whose research program
focuses on oncolytic viral therapies against solid tumors and the relationship between obesity and cancer, and
R. Stephanie Huang, PhD, whose research uses bioinformatics to predict and analyze the efficient repurposing
of FDA-approved drugs to treat cancer vulnerabilities. GM has 56 members, representing 20 departments and
8 schools or colleges. For the last budget year, these members were supported by $16.4 million in cancer-
relevant research funding (direct costs), of which $3.1 million is from the National Cancer Institute. Since 2018,
Program members have published 688 papers, 18% of which resulted from intraprogrammatic collaborations,
33% from interprogrammatic collaborations, and 82% from external collaborations.
The Masonic Cancer Center has provided substantial value to the program, including access to Shared
Resources and the cGMP-compliant Molecular and Cellular Therapeutics production facility. Internal funding
for multiple pilot studies was crucial to developing new collaborative projects, including a P01 focused on
APOBEC3B. Lastly, GM has greatly benefitted from new and diverse MCC recruits. Several physician-
scientists, including several underrepresented minority researchers who have a strong interest in functional
genomics, have joined our Program in the past 5 years."
10768148,"Immunology Program Summary
The overarching theme of the Immunology (IMM) Program is to define the basic mechanisms that control the
function and regulation of immunity so that immunotherapies that generate specific and durable antitumor
immune responses can be developed and optimized. Our Aims align with the Masonic Cancer Center (MCC)
Strategic Plan pillars of driving research discoveries and accelerating the path to cures: 1) Identify basic
mechanisms of immune cell regulation and function in the context of cancer and other chronic disease states
that form the foundation for immune-mediated clinical interventions. 2) Develop, implement, and optimize
cancer immunotherapies for clinical application.
Yoji Shimizu, PhD, and Jeffrey Miller, MD, co-lead the IMM Program. Dr. Shimizu's expertise is in basic
immunology and Dr. Miller's is in translational immunology; these synergize to accelerate the development and
optimization of cancer immunotherapies to realize the full potential of immunotherapy for cancer patients.
The IMM Program has 29 members, representing 11 departments and 3 schools or colleges. For the last
budget year, these members were supported by $13.1 million in cancer-relevant research funding (direct
costs), of which $1.85 million was from the National Cancer Institute. The Program's scientific
accomplishments over the past 5 years include new insights into resident memory T cells and the development
of a novel cancer clinical immunotherapy that targets them, the optimization and clinical testing of trispecific
engagers that specifically activate NK cells, an expanding NCI-funded program focused on developing
approaches to overcome the resistance of pancreatic cancer to immunotherapy by targeting both T cells and
myeloid cells, a preclinical mouse model to address the mechanism that leads to neurotoxicity during CAR T
cell therapy, and multiple approaches for optimizing and enhancing current cancer immunotherapies. Since
2018, Program members have published 349 papers, 24% of which resulted from intraprogrammatic
collaborations, 35% from interprogrammatic collaborations, and 57% from external collaborations.
MCC adds substantial value, such as the Cancer Research Translational Initiative, which allows IMM Program
members to continue to move fundamental, high-impact scientific discoveries directly into cancer models and
then on to clinical application. Program members also make extensive use of MCC Shared Resources and
actively participate in Translational Working Groups. MCC-supported Program meetings and events foster our
basic research and translational activities, and Program members are actively involved in community outreach
and engagement activities, particularly those that focus on education and clinical trial enrollment."
10767958,"Abstract
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a leading cause of cognitive decline and mortality in the elderly. Treatment
options for AD are limited, and there is a huge need for better medical options. AD is associated with
progressive expansion of beta amyloid plaques in the brain, leading over time to loss of brain tissue and
cognitive function. However, at present, understanding of the underlying drivers of AD is incomplete. In this
project, we will use a combination of large data sets of genetic and phenotypic data, as well as functional
genomics, to further elucidate the biological processes, pathways, and cell types leading to AD. Specifically,
we will use existing functional genomics data, as well as newly generated Massively Parallel Reporter Assays
and advanced colocalization and outlier-based statistical approaches to identify functional regulatory variants
at disease-relevant loci; these will be used to increase the power to detect AD-associated variants, particularly
for low-frequency sites. Furthermore, we will focus on linking intermediate biomarkers such as metabolites
and brain imaging data, and traits such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and sleep patterns to AD risk using
Mendelian Randomization and clustering techniques. We will further aim to partition the GWAS signal into
discrete biological factors, both by pathways/processes and by tissue. In sum, this work will lead to deeper
understanding of the causal genetic drivers of Alzheimer’s Disease."
10768149,"Screening, Prevention, Etiology, and Cancer Survivorship Program Summary
The Screening, Prevention, Etiology, and Cancer Survivorship (SPECS) Program advances research across
the broad spectrum of cancer control, including etiology, prevention, early detection, treatment, and
survivorship. SPECS research coalesces around 4 research themes: 1) Reducing the harms of tobacco, 2)
Preventing cancer through screening and intervention, 3) Improving cancer outcomes, and 4) Childhood
cancer epidemiology. SPECS members are focused on unique cancer concerns in our catchment area,
including cancer disparities in special populations and elevated rates of melanoma and hematologic cancers.
The impact of the Program is evident with research findings leading to changes in policy around commercial
tobacco products and national guidelines for cancer screening. Three Specific Aims support the research
themes of the SPECS Program: 1) Prevent cancer through identification of risk and protection factors and
develop novel approaches to reduce these risks, 2) Improve cancer outcomes with tailored screening and
novel interventions in high-risk populations, and 3) Identify factors that impact prognosis and quality of life
among cancer survivors. The SPECS Program includes 50 members, representing 6 schools and 20
departments, and has 2 Co-Leaders: Anne Blaes, MD, MS, a Professor and Division Director of Hematology,
Oncology, and Transplantation in the Medical School; and Heather Nelson, MPH, PhD, a Professor in the
Division of Epidemiology and Community Health in the School of Public Health. For the last budget year, these
members were supported by $10.5 million in cancer-relevant research funding (direct costs), of which $4.8
million is from the National Cancer Institute.
The Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) has supported the work of the Program in several value-added ways. The
Analytical Biochemistry Shared Resource facilitates biomarker work, and the Biostatistics and Cancer
Informatics Shared Resources support the design of studies and analysis of data. Community Outreach and
Engagement has provided data on cancer research needs within our catchment area and provided guidance to
members on conducting community-engaged research. In addition, MCC has provided strategic investment
through pilot project funding. The Program, in turn, brings added value to MCC by bringing clinical and
population-based perspectives with a focus of translating research to practice and policy and addressing health
equity and cancer concerns in our catchment area. Mentoring and training are a priority for the Program, with a
strong track record of early-career investigators developing independent research programs.
Future directions for the SPECS Program include 2 new initiatives, one around aging and cancer and a second
on environmental exposures and cancer."
10768150,"Transplant and Cellular Therapy Program Summary
The central scientific theme of the TCT Program is that immune cells and hematopoietic stem cells can be
engineered to overcome the principal obstacles that limit the success of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (alloHSCT)—graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prolonged immune incompetence,
conditioning toxicities, and relapse—and of immune effector cell therapies—on-target/off-tumor tissue injury,
cytokine release syndrome, and immune cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome—as well as logistical barriers
and cost. Cell therapies are also more exportable than alloHSCT, helping to meet the Cancer Center’s goal of
broadening access to novel cancer therapies in Greater Minnesota (outside of the Twin Cities).
The Program has 4 Aims to address this overarching theme: 1) Identify safer alternatives to αβT-cell immune
effector cells as “off-the-shelf” allogeneic immunotherapies, including the development of chimeric antigen
receptors with greater specificity in order to maximize tumor kill and reduce on-target/off-tumor side effects; 2)
Introduce novel engineering approaches to extend persistence and control proliferation of engineered IECs in
vivo and establish large-scale manufacturing methods for producing hundreds of doses of a well-defined,
quality-controlled, off-the-shelf product; 3) Explore nonchemotherapy approaches for lymphodepletion that are
nontoxic (eg, no myelosuppression) and safer; and 4) Develop novel pharmacologic and cellular interventions
to prevent acute and chronic GVHD and eliminate the prolonged immune incompetence commonly observed
after alloHSCT.
TCT is co-led by John E. Wagner, MD, an experienced clinical and translational investigator in the field of
HSCT and cellular therapeutics, and Brian C. Betts, MD, a physician-scientist with expertise in signal
transduction, immune tolerance, and cell therapy.
TCT has 34 members, representing 9 departments and 5 schools or colleges. For the last budget year, these
members were supported by cancer-relevant research funding of $11.6 million in direct costs, of which $0.8
million came from the NCI. Since 2018, Program members have published 850 papers, 36% of which resulted
from intraprogrammatic collaborations, 22% from interprogrammatic collaborations, and 76% from external
collaborations.
The Masonic Cancer Center supports the Program by providing Shared Resources with state-of-the-art
technologies such as mass spectrometry and flow cytometry, as well as the Clinical Trials Office, which is
critical to the implementation and oversight of numerous complex early-phase clinical trials."
10768151,"Community Outreach and Engagement Summary
Because the University of Minnesota is a land grant university, our catchment area is the entire state of
Minnesota. Currently, 16% of the population is over age 65 years, and the proportion is growing quickly.
Immigrants make up 8.2% of the population, including the largest Somali and the second-largest Hmong
populations in the US, and Minnesota has a larger rural population than the national average. Our catchment
analysis identified a number of areas of focus as we strive to reduce the cancer burden in Minnesota, including
cancers with higher burden (melanoma, leukemia, lymphoma), cancers with disparities in incidence and
mortality (colorectal, lung, breast), modifiable risks (tobacco), and protective factors (cancer screening).
Our long-term goal is to address the burden of cancer and health equity in our catchment area by building
relationships, which we will achieve through the following Specific Aims: 1) Monitor the cancer burden and
identify opportunities for advancing equity in the MCC catchment area; 2) Engage community stakeholders and
partners and create bidirectional partnerships across communities, researchers, and healthcare organizations
to advance cancer equity and reduce cancer burden; 3) Integrate catchment focus within MCC Scientific
Programs and research priorities, build capacity for community engagement across MCC Programs, and
facilitate stakeholder engagement activities to catalyze cancer research focused on catchment priorities and
community needs; and 4) Facilitate dissemination of evidence-based interventions to reduce the cancer
burden.
The MCC COE Office is led by Co–Associate Directors Jen Poynter, PhD, and Rebekah Pratt, PhD, and
Administrative Director Kiara Ellis, MSW. Dr. Poynter, an experienced epidemiologist and population health
researcher, provides expertise in cancer surveillance. Dr. Pratt provides expertise in community-based
participatory research, practice-based research, implementation science, and cancer screening in minority and
underrepresented populations. Ms. Ellis provides expertise in community engagement, community organizing,
and advocacy. The leadership team is supported by 6 full-time staff. We also partner closely with the
Minnesota Cancer Clinical Trials Network Engagement Specialist to expand our outreach to rural MN.
Our cancer education programs have reached >240,000 individuals through our public service announcements
and an additional 70,579 individuals through community-partnered events. Through our screening programs,
we have facilitated screening for breast (1400 women), oral (89 individuals), and skin (575 individuals) cancers
in the community. Future directions include expansion of patient navigation and creation of a patient advocate
program to increase enrollment of underrepresented groups in clinical trials and creation of additional
opportunities for MCC members across all Programs to engage with the community."
10768152,"Developmental Funds Summary
During the current grant cycle, the Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) used developmental funds to provide salary
support for 5 newly recruited research faculty, fund pilot projects, and support 2 developing Shared Resources.
The MCC internal grants program awarded 88 pilot projects and had an overall ROI of 822%. Of these, 13 pilot
projects were supported with $675,000 from the CCSG, 2 of which leveraged $150K in pilot funds into $4.5M in
R01 funding, and 6 of which are still in their pilot funding period. The funds for the developing Proteogenomics
Shared Resource have led to its inclusion as a new Shared Resource in the current application. The
Exposures and Effects Shared Resource is still in its early stages of development and is included now as a
developing Shared Resource. Per the new grant application guidelines, details about developing shared
resources can be found in the Shared Resource Management section.
In the upcoming funding period, MCC is proposing to use developmental funds to provide start-up support for
newly recruited faculty in certain research areas key to the updated Strategic Plan: Health Equity in the forms
of recruiting more diverse faculty and of viewing cancer through the lens of the patient experience (etiology,
screening, prevention, environmental exposures, treatment, discovery of basic mechanisms), Aging and
Cancer (senescence, survivorship, prevention), and the translational potential of Biomarkers in cancer
treatment and prevention. In addition, the CCSG funds will be used to provide supplemental funding for the
MCC Catchment Community Pilot Grants mechanism and cancer-focused pilots awarded through MCC’s
partnership with the University of Minnesota Program in Health Disparities Research. These pilots are
designed to encourage community-initiated research and to foster sustainable long-term collaboration between
community-based organizations and academic researchers on research projects focused on reducing and
eliminating health disparities."
10768153,"Shared Resources Management Summary
The Shared Resources serve to maximize the quality and innovation of the science conducted by MCC
members by providing stable, reliable, cost-effective access to technologies and services that would be difficult
to achieve otherwise. The University of Minnesota (UMN) Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) currently supports 10
Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG)-funded Shared Resources, 6 for Basic Sciences (Analytical
Biochemistry, Cancer Genomics, Comparative Pathology, Flow Cytometry, Mouse Genetics, and
Proteogenomics), 1 for Clinical Research (Translational Therapy Shared Resource). and 3 with shared
oversight (Biostatistics, Cancer Informatics, and Genome Engineering). In addition, we are proposing to
develop 2 new Shared Resources: Immunotherapeutics Engineering and Exposures & Effects. The Shared
Resources support all 6 Research Programs and are managed by faculty director(s) with support from
technical expert coordinators. Most Shared Resources are located on the Twin Cities campus and are
strategically positioned to meet the needs of a core group of MCC users. The goal of Shared Resource
Management (SRM) is to provide effective oversight and support to Shared Resources in order to provide our
members with access to technologies and services that enhance the scientific productivity of their cancer-
focused research. The Specific Aims for SRM are to 1) establish, manage, and increase access to MCC- and
UMN-supported Shared Resources that advance the research goals of the MCC membership; 2) establish new
Shared Resources identified as critical to fulfilling the research needs of MCC members; and 3) develop and
implement effective marketing and outreach strategies that increase transdisciplinary, collaborative use of
Shared Resources. The Associate Director of Basic Sciences, Carol A. Lange, PhD (Cellular Mechanisms
Program), and Associate Director of Clinical Research, Melissa Geller, MD (Transplant and Cellular Therapies
Program), oversee SRM and implementation of the scientific vision. Other members of the SRM team include
members of the Shared Resource Internal Advisory Committee, the MCC Finance Director, the Research
Development Manager, and the Shared Resources’ faculty leaders and coordinators. The SRM team is
responsible for determining and evaluating the accessibility and costs of services provided; monitoring quality
and user satisfaction of Shared Resources services through surveys and usage metrics; and ensuring that
Shared Resources evolve in a manner that aligns with MCC strategic priorities. Approximately 75% of all MCC
members utilized one or more of our Shared Resources during the current CCSG cycle. In the coming cycle,
outreach efforts will ensure that the Resources and the services they provide are widely known by MCC
members and the larger UMN community, while still ensuring priority access to MCC members."
10768506,"SUMMARY
 The loss of tissue homeostasis and regenerative capacity with age underlies some of the most challenging
health issues in the elderly. A major contributor to age-related declines in the structure and function of many
tissues is the loss of stem cell function that occurs during the aging process. To slow, arrest, or even reverse
those age-related declines in stem cell function would represent a major therapeutic success based upon
advances in both stem cell biology and the biology of aging.
 The primary focus of this Program is to understand the molecular basis of age-related changes in stem cell
function. An underlying premise is that such an understanding will reveal ways to enhance aged stem cell
function and tissue repair. Based on many studies, including innovative work from the laboratories of this
Program, there is increasing evidence of dysfunctional genetic, epigenomic, transcriptional, and metabolic
changes in stem cells with age. A central concept that is woven throughout this Program is that systemic
factors may mediate some of these changes, and that, conversely, cell-extrinsic influences may restore
youthful properties to aged stem cells. Another unifying concept is how changing genetic and epigenetic
diversity in stem cell populations combine with age-associated alterations in their niches to create an ever
changing adaptive landscape, one that may select for subsets of stem cells that are actually suboptimal for
tissue homeostasis and repair.
 To examine those concepts experimentally, this Program includes Projects that focus on stem cell
populations from three tissues – muscle (Project 1), brain (Project 2), and blood (Project 3). In the current
proposal, we extend our previous studies along several themes that are shared among the Projects. These
themes include changes in stem cell heterogeneity with age, the role of metabolic changes as determinants of
the aged epigenomic state, and the impact of rejuvenating interventions on stem cells and their niches. The
Projects are supported by three essential Cores – an Administrative Core; a Single Cell and Spatial Proteomics
Core, which includes cutting-edge spatial proteomic technologies; and a Bioinformatics Core both to serve as
the critical hub for storing, processing, visualizing, analyzing, and sharing data from the three Projects, and
also to develop pioneering spatial transcriptomics. Overall, the investigators who are Project Leaders and Core
Directors are internationally recognized experts in their respective fields. They bring to the Program the full
breadth of expertise, creativity, and records of accomplishment to assure an integrated, innovative, and highly
successful Program to explore the molecular mechanisms of stem cell aging and rejuvenation. The successful
completion of the studies of this proposal has the potential to advance therapeutics to enhance tissue
homeostasis and repair in elderly individuals."
10769707,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are complex disorders manifested by qualitatively atypical social
communication skills and an aberrant behavioral repertoire that vary in severity across individuals. We lack
neurobiologically-grounded predictors of autism in the general population. Our studies seek to fill this critical
gap in our knowledge about neurobiologically-grounded quantitative signatures that precede manifestations of
ASD in toddlers recruited from the general population. We aim to (i) apply advanced computational analytic
techniques to formally chart the emergence of atypical developmental trajectories, and (ii) uncover and validate
neurobiologically-grounded, clinically meaningful subtypes predictive of future risk for atypical development,
revolutionizing brain imaging in young children. In our previous work we have discovered that head
movements during functional MRI provide an abundant source of useful movement data whose statistical
features are linked to clinical and cognitive outcomes in children and adults diagnosed with ASD. Our recent
studies have revealed that quantitative signatures of atypical learning trajectories can be detected as early as
1-2 months in infants at high familial risk for developing ASD. Atypical functioning of the sensorimotor system
has deleterious functional consequences across diverse domains of learning and development and may
contribute to ASD manifestations, in toddlers screened prospectively in the general population. Using data from
the NIH-funded National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) we will test whether atypical movement
variability during MRI scans during the 2nd year of life in N=212 toddlers from the general population is
predictive of ASD or non-ASD outcomes (vs. typical development, TD) ascertained during the 3rd year. We will
rigorously quantify key kinematic parameters during MRI scans acquired in toddlers ages 12-24 months
according to different conditions, including sleeping or resting, while language is presented to sleeping
toddlers, and also during a socially-orienting scan. We hypothesize that deleterious, context-incongruent
signatures during the 2nd year of life in toddlers will be related subsequently to greater ASD manifestations at
36-48 months. Machine learning algorithms will be used to classify ASD, non-ASD, and TD toddlers. The
overall goal of these studies is to illuminate the neurobiological basis of sensorimotor variability in toddlers from
the general population and to establish that sensorimotor signatures are part and parcel of the child’s future
ASD diagnosis, a finding which will have profound, transformative implications for neuroimaging methods in
young children. This knowledge will provide new, early mechanistic insights into the basis of such associations
recently established in children, adolescents, and adults with and without ASD, as well as in human infants,
and advance Research Priorities of the NIMH."
10769740,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Congenital malformations are the major cause of infant mortality in the US. However, our understanding of the
genetic causes of congenital malformations is severely limited negatively impacting our ability to care for these
patients. To discover the genetic causes, we and others have employed human genomics analyses on patients.
In particular, we have focused on Heterotaxy (Htx), a disorder of left-right patterning. Normally, our internal
organs are asymmetrically distributed along the left-right axis and failure of this process can lead to severe
disease including congenital heart disease, gut malrotation, and immune deficiencies. Human genetic analysis
of these patients has identified many candidate genes, but the functional relevance is unclear since a plausible
disease pathogenesis mechanism is unknown for nearly all of the candidate genes.
In the previous grant period, we proposed a gain of function screen where we overexpressed Htx candidate
genes in Xenopus looking for potent phenotypes. While this strategy has limitations, we discovered multiple
genes that gave interesting phenotypes that led to exciting new insights into Wnt and Cilia signaling pathways.
Funded by the grant proposal, we also developed new techniques for assaying cilia based extracellular fluid flow
and notably CRISPR based F0 gene editing.
The development of these new technologies has transformed the strategy that we will employ for gene screening
in the subsequent grant period. Importantly, we will use F0 CRISPR based loss of function screening which is
rapid, inexpensive, and highly effective. Our “next generation” screen will also include an investigation not only
of cardiac looping but additional steps in the LR signaling cascade. Finally, we will investigate patient variants
and connect with researchers across the world using GeneMatcher to exploit our high-throughput animal model
to test additional patient variants and increase the number of experimentally tested alleles in our system. Finally,
in a subsequent Aim, we will place Htx candidate genes into four key pathways critical for LR patterning: Cilia,
Wnt, Notch, and TGF-β signaling. We have considerable experience in each of these pathways converting novel
unexplored genes into molecular mechanisms in each of these pathways. Therefore, our previous experience
demonstrates that we are especially well suited to translate patient driven gene discovery into molecular
mechanisms."
10769741,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Whether it's choosing between dinner locations, health plans or investment vehicles for our savings, many
decisions involve a tradeoff between exploring options that are unknown and exploiting options we know well.
Making such explore-exploit decisions “correctly”, i.e. in such a way as to maximize long-term gain, is
surprisingly difficult and mathematically optimal solutions are intractable in most cases. Despite this difficulty,
we have recently shown that young people make remarkably effective explore-exploit decisions using a
mixture of two strategies: directed exploration, in which information seeking drives exploration by choice, and
random exploration, in which adaptive behavioral variability drives exploration by chance. Despite this
progress, little is known about how directed and random exploration are implemented in the brain, and almost
nothing is known about how these strategies change with age. Given the ubiquity of these decisions in daily
life, this is a critical omission if we are to understand decision making in aging and cognitive decline.
The objective of this proposal is to develop and test a neurocomputational model that describes explore-exploit
decision making throughout the lifespan. In this model, we propose that the overall balance between
exploration and exploitation is set by activity in a specific set of brain areas. Our central hypothesis is that age-
related changes in explore-exploit behavior can be accounted for by age-related changes in this circuit. To test
this hypothesis we will pursue three Specific Aims that test key predictions of this neurocomputational model
as it applies to healthy aging. Aim 1 will test the behavioral predictions of this model by characterizing the
explore-exploit behavior of a large sample of healthy older and younger adults. Aim 2 will map the brain areas
involved in directed and random exploration using functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging.
Finally, in Aim 3 we will manipulate directed and random exploration using transcranial magnetic stimulation to
perturb neural firing in key areas of the explore-exploit network.
The proposed research is innovative as the first to study directed and random exploration in older adults, the
first to probe the neural correlates of these strategies, and the first to manipulate explore-exploit behavior in
older adults with transcranial magnetic stimulation. In addition, by testing the predictions of the circuit model,
this work will build towards a neurocomputational account of explore-exploit behavior. This model will have
significant impact on our understanding of decision making in old age and provide a framework for
understanding how these decisions change with cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, if our
single-session TMS manipulations are successful, we will open the possibility of using multi-session neural
stimulation to enhance explore-exploit decision making in cases where it is impaired."
10770467,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a prevalent chemical modification of RNA that influences gene expression and
cell signaling. The levels of m6A are dynamically regulated by a RNA methyltransferase complex and by the
alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG)-dependent RNA demethylases, FTO and ALKBH5. Misregulated RNA methylation,
and its attendant effects on the epitranscriptome, has been associated with a host of human diseases,
including obesity/diabetes, auto-immunity, neurodegeneration and cancer. Notably, these conditions can all
develop in association with environmental factors that influence oxidative stress, e.g., atmospheric pollutants,
cigarette smoking, ultraviolet rays, radiation, toxic chemicals, etc., but the putative influence of redox
homeostasis on RNA methylation is unknown. To start to address this knowledge gap, we first considered that
the activity of the m6A “erasers” FTO and ALKBH5 rely on intact intermediary metabolism, a point that we
illustrated with the discovery that accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglurate (D-2-HG) in IDH1/2 mutant cancers
inhibits FTO/ALKBH5 and elevates m6A levels. We expanded on these data by showing that loss of D2- or L2-
hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (D2HGDH, L2HGDH), which convert D- or L-2-HG into αKG, also suppress
FTO/ALKBH5 activity and promotes RNA hypermethylation. Importantly, work from our group and others have
uncovered a marked interplay between cellular accumulation of 2-HG, intermediary metabolism and redox
homeostasis. These observations led us to speculate that high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may
broadly regulate the epitranscriptome. To start to test this concept, we exposed human B cells (normal and
malignant) to physiologically relevant levels of H202 and ethanol and detected a marked increase in m6A
levels. Using CRISPR KO models of FTO and ALKBH5, we preliminarily confirmed our hypothesis that ROS
modify RNA methylation by inhibiting the activity of RNA demethylases. Notably, D2HGDH and L2HGDH are
NAD+-dependent enzymes, and since ROS elevation consumes NAD+, it is possible that suppression of
D2HGDH/L2HGDH play a part in the cross-talk between redox homeostasis and RNA methylation. Here, we
will use genetic models in vitro an in vivo to test the overall hypothesis that oxidative stress-mediated
disruption of intermediary metabolism modifies the epitranscriptome. More specifically, we postulate that NAD+
consumption secondary to oxidative stress impairs the activity of D2HGDH and L2HGDH, disrupts 2-HG/αKG
homeostasis, thus inhibiting FTO/ALKBH5 activity and promoting RNA hypermethylation. In aim 1, we will
mechanistically explain how ROS inhibits FTO/ALKBH5 activity and test if NAD+-modulating agents can correct
the RNA hypermethylation associated with oxidative stress. In aim 2, using a novel compound mouse model of
B-cell lymphoma, we will test the concept that suppression of RNA demethylases is integral to the oncogenic
role of ROS. In aim 3, we will define the ROS-driven methylRNA/gene expression signatures and identify the
signaling pathways that are deregulated at the intersection of redox imbalance and the epitranscriptome."

Abstract 
Post-­mitotic  neurons  in  the  mammalian  brain  form  synapses  that  dynamically  remodel  throughout  an 
individual’s  lifetime  to  encode  short-­  and  long-­term  memories.  Synaptic  plasticity  involves  spatiotemporal  fine-­
tuning  of  gene  expression  levels  in  response  to  environmental  stimuli,  including  rapid  transcription  of 
immediate  early  genes  on  the  time  scale  of  minutes  and  longer-­term  global  chromatin  remodeling.  The  cis-­
acting  genetic  and  epigenetic  elements  that  govern  activity-­dependent  expression  are  of  outstanding  interest 
toward understanding how experiences sculpt the brain. Here, we submit a proposal entitled ‘Elucidating the 3-­
D epigenetic determinants of activity-­dependent gene expression in mammalian neurons’. We have assembled 
an  interdisciplinary  team  with  critical  expertise  in  genome  folding,  epigenetics,  chromatin  engineering, 
neurobiology,  synaptogenesis,  electrophysiology,  and  computational  biology.  We  aim  to  elucidate  the  causal 
link among long-­range looping interactions, epigenetic modifications on the linear genome, expression of their 
spatial  target  genes,  and  the  activity  of  mammalian  neurons.  We  hypothesize  that  immediate  early  genes  will 
functionally engage in singular short-­range loops to rapidly activate expression on the time scale of seconds to 
minutes in response to the environmental stimulus of neuronal activation. By contrast, we posit that secondary 
response  genes  will  spatially  connect  via  architectural  proteins  into  complex,  long-­range,  pre-­existing 
topological  configurations  to poise  the genome  for  a  second  wave  of  expression  on  the order  of  hours  to  days 
in  response  to  neuronal  firing.  To  test  our  hypotheses,  we  will  create  high-­resolution  genome  folding  maps 
using  the  Hi-­C  during  a  time  course  of  activation  in  mouse  hippocampal  neurons.  We  will  identify  activity-­
dependent  enhancers  and  gene  expression  genome-­wide  and  determine  their  temporal  profile  with  respect 
pre-­formed and  activity-­dependent  loops.  We  will formulate  mathematical  models  to predict  activity-­dependent 
expression  of  immediate  early  genes  and  secondary  response  genes  from  the  timing  of  enhancer  activation 
and looping contacts. By integrating single nucleotide variants linked to autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, 
addiction,  and  attention-­deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  with  our  models,  we  will  predict  the  specific  target  genes 
and  potential  pathways  involved  in  neurological  disease.  Finally,  we  will  dissect  the  functional  role  for  loops 
and  enhancer  activity  in  regulating  the  activity-­dependent  transcription  of  Bdnf  and  c-­fos  using  CRISPR 
genome  editing  of  architectural  protein  binding  motifs  and  CRISPRi  inhibition  of  specific  enhancers.  Our  work 
will  uncover the genome’s  long-­range  interaction  landscape  in  mammalian neurons and  reveal  the causal  link 
between  the  3-­D  Epigenome  and  the  kinetics  of  transcriptional  response  to  environmentally  stimulated

10768263,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The NIH-funded aquatic model stock centers have expressed concerns over growing needs for them and their
associated research communities to use germplasm repositories in preservation and sharing of genetic
resources. Because of a lack of comprehensive repository capabilities, the National Xenopus Resource (NXR),
Ambystoma Genetic Resource Center (AGSC), and National Resource for Aplysia (NRA) face many challenges
such as the risk of losing valuable genetic lines. In the ongoing R24 project (2020-2024) we have developed or
improved practical approaches for sperm cryopreservation for NXR and AGSC, and we are making breakthrough
progress in embryo and larvae cryopreservation for NRA. For Xenopus, we developed a standardizable,
streamlined pathway which is scalable and substantially improves throughput and quality assurance. For
Ambystoma we developed a de novo cryopreservation protocol and expanded it into a functional pathway which
produced a 50% fertilization rate with thawed sperm. For Aplysia, we have recently achieved short-term (>10 hr)
post-thaw survival of free-swimming larvae by vitrification. During this project, we have collaborated closely with
the stock centers and responded to their needs through hundreds of interactions including site visits, training
visits, phone calls, remote meetings, and workshops. In addition, we have developed a central “Hub” at the
Aquatic Germplasm and Genetic Resource Center (AGGRC) that supports resource sharing among the stock
centers, the USDA National Animal Germplasm Program, and user communities leading to the creation of a NIH
Aquatic Biomedical Germplasm Repository Network. In sum, the ongoing Hub R24 project has developed basic
reproductive and cryopreservation protocols and customized these based on the specific resources and needs
of the stock centers. Based on this success, the overall goal of this proposed renewal R24 Hub work is to advance
the capabilities at the resource centers from feasibility establishment to operational repositories with high-
throughput production and routine quality management programs. Proposed translational research will focus on
building practical capabilities at the stock-center level for amphibians; expanded fundamental research and
characterization will proceed at the AGGRC for Aplysia, and resource sharing platforms will be established at
the stock center and research community levels. To facilitate resource sharing and distribution, we will advance
the NIH Aquatic Biomedical Germplasm Repository Network from proof of concept to establishment of formal
operations. This will ensure that research communities will have access to valuable genetic lines that may
otherwise be at risk of being lost. The specific aims are: 1) Develop high-throughput sperm cryopreservation
pathways and quality management programs for operational repository capabilities at NXR and AGSC; 2)
Develop operational repository capabilities for early life stages of Aplysia sea hares and the algae species
required for Aplysia feeding and larval development, and 3) Advance the AGGRC Hub and NIH Aquatic
Biomedical Germplasm Repository Network to facilitate resource management, sharing, and distribution."
10918214,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity are increasing in the United States (US) despite most of
these outcomes being preventable with timely and appropriate care. Most medical responders are not optimally
proficient in caring for patients who experience maternal medical emergencies, including maternal cardiac
arrest. This gap exists among first responders and across medical specialties, and even for OB-specialists
trained in Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support. Leading organizations in women’s health care and
resuscitation have all called for efforts to better prepare healthcare workers (HCWs) for maternal medical
emergencies, and increasingly federal agencies and state legislatures are incentivizing or requiring hospitals to
provide this education and training. Nonetheless, the implementation of evidence-based education for maternal
medical emergencies in health systems across the US is inconsistent and national credentialing standards do
not exist. The study team developed Obstetric Life SupportTM (OBLSTM), the first of its kind interdisciplinary
simulation curriculum to train hospital-based and prehospital HCWs on preventing, recognizing, and managing
maternal medical emergencies. Preliminary data from a randomized, cross-over trial shows significant
improvement in clinical competencies, knowledge, and confidence for the intervention group compared to the
controls. To date, OBLSTM training has been implemented with HCWs in high-resource settings with access to
optimal resuscitation resources (e.g., massive transfusion protocol, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,
medical responder trained in resuscitative cesarean delivery). However, HCWs in rural and low-resource
settings may face pressures (e.g., financial, workforce shortages, underdeveloped infrastructure) that differ
from high-resource settings, and require adaptations to OBLSTM’s learning objectives, content, and delivery
mode to optimize medical emergency care in these contexts. The objective of this project is to adapt OBLSTM
for implementation in rural and low-resource settings. Rural will be defined based on Rural-Urban Commuting
Area (RUCA) codes. Low-resource settings are counties designated by March of Dimes as having low or no
access to maternity care. The study will be conducted at UCONN Health in partnership with the Northeast
Rural Hospital Association and the Dartmouth Health Center for Rural Emergency Services and Trauma. The
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and Intervention Mapping will guide the implementation
planning and adaptation process. Specifically, the study aims to: (1) Identify barriers and facilitators to
implementation of OBLSTM in rural and low-resource settings; (2) Systematically adapt OBLSTM for HCWs
practicing in rural and low-resource settings; and (3) Implement and evaluate the adapted curriculum (OBLSTM
– Remote Access) in rural communities in New England. A mixed methods approach will be employed.
Findings from this study will be used to promote national scale-up of this important health care innovation with
the goal of improving patient safety and reducing inequities in maternal morbidity and mortality."
10915578,"Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and contributes to more than
$320 billion annually in health care costs and lost productivity. Manufacturing communities,
many of which are rural, have significantly higher rates of smoking, obesity, physical inactivity,
diabetes, and cardiovascular deaths, compared to other communities. Similarly, manufacturing
employment is associated with higher rates of hypertension and smoking. Two-thirds of
manufacturing workers are male, and manufacturing workers are, on average, older than
workers in other industries.
Many large manufacturers provide health services to employees, spouses, dependents, and
retirees through worksite health clinics, particularly in areas where there are shortages of
primary care providers. Given their potential reach into manufacturing communities, worksite
health clinics are well positioned to address deficiencies in small and rural communities.
In this study, Healthy Hearts in Manufacturing (HHM), we propose to examine the use of
worksite health clinics as a vehicle for improving cardiovascular care in manufacturing
communities. We will adapt a package of evidence-based interventions related to hypertension
and tobacco cessation, implemented with evidence-based supports, including on-site practice
facilitation, health information technology support, and data feedback and benchmarking. In
prior grants from AHRQ, our team has successfully implemented these cardiovascular
interventions in small primary care physician practices.
The specific aims are to: (1) Contextually adapt, for worksite clinics, evidence-based
interventions for cardiovascular disease care, previously designed for implementation in small
primary care practices; (2) Implement HHM in 12 randomly selected worksite clinics, identify
facilitators and barriers to sustainable maintenance of HHM, and test whether HHM improves
hypertension control and tobacco screening and cessation intervention; and (3) Estimate the
budget impact of HHM and the potential health care savings to companies and Medicare.
This study is innovative in its use of worksite health clinics as a means to improve care for a
hard-to-reach, disproportionally rural population with high rates of smoking and chronic illness. It
will also be a first effort to report on quality measures from worksite health clinics. Results may
reveal an economically sustainable quality improvement strategy to address heart health for an
at-risk population. The study will produce findings, tools, materials, and lessons that could aid
other efforts to implement evidence-based quality improvement in worksite health clinics."
10934488,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Nurses are the largest sector of health providers in the United States (US). Recent studies have found
widespread biases among nurses, with the most common bias being in the area of race and ethnicity. Nurses'
biases affect treatment decisions, thereby affecting patient outcomes. Nurses' biases are especially critical in
settings where nurses are the main provider of healthcare services, such as home healthcare (HHC) where
nurses visit more than 5 million patients in their homes across the US every year. Racial biases are reflected in
medical documentation; in hospital settings, clinical notes about Black patients have up to 50% higher odds of
containing stigmatizing language (i.e., language that negatively characterizes patients) than White patients'
notes. In the HHC setting, we also found that clinical notes of Black and Hispanic patients had up to 20%
higher odds of including stigmatizing language than White and Asian patients. Critically, our studies found that
stigmatizing language in the clinical notes is associated with negative clinicians' attitudes and lower quality of
patient care.
 One promising technology—natural language processing (NLP)—has the potential to help uncover
stigmatizing language in millions of HHC nursing notes. In collaboration with two of the largest providers of
HHC services in the US (Louisiana Health Care Group and VNS Health, with more than 100,000 patients on
the combined daily census), this study assembles an interdisciplinary team of experts in HHC nursing, NLP,
and clinical decision support to build the first step in designing a nurse-centered NLP-based system to rEduce
stigmatiziNG languAGE (""ENGAGE"") via the following specific aims. Aim 1: Expand and refine the ontology of
stigmatizing language applicable to HHC. Aim 2: Determine the optimal NLP approach to automatically and
accurately identify stigmatizing language in the clinical notes of geographically dispersed HHC agencies. Aim
3: Compare the prevalence of stigmatizing language by race and ethnicity. Aim 4: Develop an NLP-driven
ENGAGE system to reduce stigmatizing language in HHC clinical notes.
 Accomplishing these aims will result in ENGAGE- a technology-driven behavior change intervention
that will help to identify and eliminate racial biases among HHC nurses."
10770418,"Genomic rearrangements involving the ETS transcription factor family genes are early driver events in prostate
cancer (PCa). These rearrangements typically involve the fusion of androgen-regulated transcriptionally active
genes with the ETS genes (ERG, ETV1, ETV4 and ETV5), resulting in fusion gene over-expression. The most
prevalent ETS gene rearrangement, which is observed in >50% of PCa, involves the fusion of the androgen
receptor (AR) target gene, TMPRSS2, with the ERG proto-oncogene, resulting in the formation of TMPRSS2-
ERG gene fusion. Defining the mechanisms associated with the formation of recurrent genomic
rearrangements will contribute towards our understanding of PCa etiology and will impact several aspects of
clinical disease management ranging from prevention, early diagnosis and therapeutic targeting. The overall
goal of this proposal is to apply innovative genomics approaches to define the origins of recurrent genomic
rearrangements in PCa. On the basis of our work and the emerging body of scientific literature, we hypothesize
that androgen signaling associated 3D genome organization and transcriptional regulation contribute towards
topological stress in the genome. The enzyme DNA topoisomerase II beta (TOP2B) resolves topological stress
by the formation of transient DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). We suggest that oxidative stress impairs the
function of TOP2B, resulting in the formation of persistent DNA DSBs. Clustering of DNA DSBs in the genome
increases the likelihood of their mis-repair and the formation of recurrent genomic rearrangements. In Specific
Aim 1, we will define the AR-induced, transcription-associated chromatin interactions in PCa models. We will
leverage this knowledge to pinpoint the mechanisms by which germ-line PCa predisposing risk SNPs and
somatic structural variations alter the 3D genome architecture to drive transcriptional dysregulation in PCa. In
Specific Aim 2, we will map the genomic regions associated with topological stress by applying our new
strategy to identify TOP2B occupancy. We will also test the role of oxidative stress and TDP2, a 5-prime
tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase in the formation of TOP2B mediated DNA breaks. Furthermore, we will test the
hypothesis that TOP2B mediated DNA DSBs are non-random and occur at distinct genomic regions in the
various cell types of the prostate—dictated in part by transcription-associated 3D genome architecture.
Therefore, in Specific Aim 3, we will unravel the relationship between prostate epithelial differentiation status
and the formation of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions. We anticipate that successful completion of these aims will
enhance our understanding of the origins of recurrent genomic rearrangements in PCa. We believe that our
discoveries in PCa models will have broad implications for many other types of cancers. Importantly, these
studies will serve as the rationale for future clinical trials aimed towards the prevention and treatment of PCa."

University School of Medicine (IUSM). A primary goal is to provide an organizational framework, anchored in
the Medical Neurosciences Training Program, to functionally integrate the activities of existing and developing
NIA supported resources at the IUSM. The NIA supports the Indiana Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center,
the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease, the Regenstrief Institute and the Center for Aging
Research as well as the recently funded MODEL-AD center and LEADS clinical trial. Finally, Eli Lilly is
headquartered in Indianapolis and has a substantial research effort focused on Alzheimer’s disease. These
institutions comprise a unique and significant intellectual and infrastructural resource that will be leveraged in
the current proposal.
 The IUSM and the NIA have recently committed substantial institutional resources to develop basic
science research efforts on AD and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the success of the investigative
effort will be contingent upon provision of a skilled workforce. The present application describes a plan to
employ the Medical Neuroscience Training program as a vehicle to enhance and coordinate the research and
training activities at the IUSM. The training program will simultaneously enhance and expand the institutional
research capacity by providing a talented pool of young investigators to faculty within the individual research
centers, and provide a high level training for these individuals. Importantly, the activities of the training
program provide a mechanism to promote interactions and collaborations between the faculty and research
staff at IUSM and Lilly who work on aging and neurodegenerative diseases.

through a) modernizing the graduate curriculum to provide foundational training in the Neurosciences, aging
and neurodegenerative diseases, b) initiation of a postdoctoral training program to promote the professional
advancement of this important component of the scientific workforce and c) provide undergraduate research
experiences. 2) To employ the Medical Neuroscience Training Program as a vehicle to integrate the activities
of the various IUSM centers focused on Aging and Neurodegenerative diseases. 3) To promote translational
research interactions through the Medical Neuroscience Training Program with Eli Lilly."
10774053,"ABSTRACT
Establishment of the epithelial barrier is a key feature of healthy gut, and barrier disruption is a common
perpetuator of various gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel diseases. Two major processes
regulate integrity, disruption, and repair of the gut barrier. One is assembly of epithelial tight junctions (TJ) and
adherens junctions (AJ); the other is intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) migration in normal and injured mucosa.
Remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton drives both TJ/AJ formation and IEC migration. Post-translational
modifications of actin molecules governs reversible assembly of actin monomers into the filaments and higher-
order cytoskeletal structures. Actin methylation on the His73 residue catalyzed by a specific SETD3
methyltransferase is an emerging regulator of cytoskeleton-dependent cellular processes. Roles of SETD3-
driven actin methylation in gut barrier integrity, disruption, and repair remain unexplored. Our preliminary data
demonstrates that SETD3 expression and actin His73 methylation are decreased in IEC isolated from
ulcerative colitis patients. SETD3 depletion in IEC monolayers leads to disruption of the epithelial barrier and
attenuation of epithelial wound healing. Furthermore, SETD3 knockout mice are more sensitive to dextran
sodium sulfate (DSS) induced colitis. This exciting preliminary data provides a strong scientific premise for the
following innovative hypothesis: SETD3-mediated actin methylation is a novel regulator of the intestinal
epithelial barrier assembly and function; decreased SETD3 expression in the inflamed mucosa
enhances leakiness and inhibits repair of the gut barrier.
This hypothesis will be tested in the following Aims: (1) to delineate the roles of SETD3 in establishment of the
intestinal epithelial barrier and assembly of apical junctions; (2) to determine the roles of SETD3 in regulating
intestinal epithelial cell migration; (3) to examine the roles of SETD3 in regulating disruption and restitution of
the intestinal epithelial barrier in vivo. The study will utilize in vitro IEC monolayers, ex vivo primary intestinal
organoids from SETD3-null mice cultured as 2-monolyers or in Gut-on-a-chip devise, as well as in vivo mouse
models of colitis and mucosal repair.
Roles of SETD3 will be examined by a combination of functional (IEC permeability measurements, wound
healing), biochemical (immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation), imaging (confocal microscopy, FRAP analysis,
FRET tension biosensors), and genetic (CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, SETD3 mutagenesis and overexpression,
knockout mice) approaches. Significance: the proposed study will provide novel insights into the mechanisms
that regulate intestinal epithelial barrier integrity, injury and repair. It will also identify new therapeutic targets to
prevent breakdown and enhance reparation of the gut barrier in patients with digestive diseases"

10746820,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Bone fragility increasing fracture risk is one of the defining components of mineral and bone disorder of
chronic kidney disease (CKD-MBD). Dysregulated bone homeostasis in CKD is significantly linked with
morbidity and mortality as patients with CKD that sustain a fracture exhibit higher mortality rates. Additionally,
inability to maintain normal bone homeostasis contributes to elevated circulating calcium and phosphorus and
development of vascular calcifications. The adenine-diet induced model of renal failure in mice exhibit
pathogenic bone alterations parallel to CKD patient bone biopsies including porosity and elevated osteoclasts
number. These histological features occur in conjunction with development of iron deficiency anemia, a
frequent occurrence during CKD. However, the direct effects of disrupted iron handling on bone homeostasis
during renal failure remain unclear. Previous studies have found iron deficiency blunts bone formation both in
calvaria osteoblasts and in rodents fed an iron deficient diet. Recent studies have found that iron deficiency
alters cellular polyamine synthesis ultimately reducing spermine and spermidine content. Both spermine and
spermidine have been found to be important for osteoblast differentiation and function Interestingly, patients
with CKD have also been observed to have reduced spermine levels compared to controls. The unifying
hypothesis of this proposal is osteoblast differentiation is impaired in CKD-MBD and critical portions of this
pathophysiology are mediated by iron deficiency reduced polyamine synthesis. We address this novel avenue
of research with two specific aims in this Stephen I. Katz Early Stage Investigator Research Grant. In Aim 1,
we will test the hypothesis that iron-deficiency mediated reduction in spermine inhibits osteoblast
differentiation. This will be accomplished by assessing spermine supplementation during iron deficiency
conditions both in vitro and in vivo. Previous studies indicate that iron deficiency may blunt spermine
conversion by reducing spermine synthase. Thus, we will also examine the bone protective transgenic
upregulation of spermine synthase during iron deficiency of CKD. Finally, to determine how these small
molecules alter gene expression, we will undertake epigenetic sequencing studies as both iron deficiency and
polyamines have been postulated to be involved in changes in DNA accessibility. In Aim 2 we will test the
hypothesis that iron deficiency of CKD promotes polyamine catabolism at the cellular and systemic level. In
patient studies, CKD serum is found to have elevated spermine oxidase activity compared to controls.
Additionally, iron deficiency can increase N-acetyltransferase protein levels that catabolize spermine. We will
undertake genetic and pharmacological inhibition of during iron deficiency of CKD to address these novel
questions. Completion of these studies will significantly enhance our understanding of bone homeostasis in
the context of CKD. Our studies will also have important therapeutic implications in regards to interventions
for iron deficiency and CKD-MBD."

first to establish that dietary supplementation of a single oxidized fatty acid (15HETE) of the LOX pathway is
sufficient to cause PH in wild type mice in the absence of any other PH stimulus. In our very recent publication
in Hypertension, we reported T cell-dependent endothelial cell apoptosis as one of the mechanisms underlying
15HETE induced PH. However, the exact molecular mechanisms leading to PAEC apoptosis and onset of PH
are not known. To unravel the molecular mechanisms, we performed RNA-Seq on the lungs and intestine of
mice on 15HETE diet and integrated our RNA-Seq data with online microarrays of human PAH lungs and
identified IFI44 (IFN inducible protein 44) as the only novel common gene that was significantly upregulated.
IFI44 is an interferon inducible protein and our preliminary data shows that IFNα4 is specifically increased in the
small intestine of mice on 15HETE diet. Our preliminary time course experiments revealed increased expression
of IFI44 in the small intestine, which precedes its upregulation in the lung, suggesting that 15HETE may act on
the small intestine initially. In addition, our pilot data shows that IFI44 is expressed in the immune cells in the
lungs of human PAH patients and in T cells in mouse lungs on 15HETE diet. Our bioinformatic analysis also
revealed that expression of IFI44 in immune cells in the lungs correlates with CXCL10 (a proinflammatory
cytokine) and TRAIL (Tumor Necrosis Factor Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand). TRAIL and CXCL10 are both
known to induce endothelial cell apoptosis. Our preliminary data also shows i) Knockdown of IFI44 in the lungs
of mice on 15HETE diet prevented development of PH, and ii) blocking the pathologic action of Cxcl10 rescues
PH development. Taken together, our overall hypotheses are i) dietary 15HETE acts on intestinal epithelial cells
to produce IFN4, which induces IFI44 in specific immune cells of the Lamina Propria. IFI44 positive immune
cells migrate to the lungs and in coordination with CXCL10/TRAIL trigger PAEC death, causing PH; and ii) IFI44
and CXCL10 can serve as novel therapeutic targets in the lungs to prevent or even rescue development of PH
in mice on 15HETE diet. Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms by which 15HETE activates the intestinal
epithelium resulting in the development of PH; Aim 2 will examine how activation of IFI44 in immune cells in the
small intestine induces endothelial cell apoptosis in the lungs through CXC10 and/or TRAIL dependent
mechanisms causing pulmonary hypertension; and Aim 3 will examine whether IFI44 and CXCL10 can serve as
novel therapeutic targets in the lungs to prevent or rescue development of PH in mice on 15HETE diet."

Arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI provides noninvasive quantification of tissue blood flow in physiological
units of ml/100g/min using magnetic labeling of blood water as an endogenous diffusible flow tracer, and is one
of the few MRI parameters whose biological basis is known. ASL MRI has primarily been used in the brain to
measure cerebral blood flow (CBF), a key physiological parameter that serves a biomarker of cerebrovascular
integrity and regional brain function with a broad range of applications in basic and clinical neuroscience research
and in clinical care. ASL MRI was originally conceived by our laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania, and
we have been responsible for demonstrating many of its technical advances and applications in biomedical
research. Although ASL MRI has been translated to clinical use, commercial ASL MRI technologies have failed
to keep up with research progress.
In response to the special funding mechanism: PAR-18-530, this Academic Industrial Partnership project will
provide dedicated resources to further develop, maintain, and deliver state-of-the-art ASL MRI acquisition and
processing technologies for clinical research on the Siemens MRI platform, which is the most widely used MRI
platform in neuroscience. An Academic Industrial Partnership is needed because market forces for commercial
MRI technologies have been insufficient to drive the development of state-of-the-art ASL MRI capabilities in
product sequences, yet close collaboration between academia and industry are required to deliver a streamlined
capability to users. The resulting technologies will be disseminated free of charge to research sites through a
new code exchange platform developed by Siemens.
While a major innovation will be the delivery of a free ASL MRI software package featuring state-of-the-art
approaches to maximize sensitivity, spatial and temporal resolution, and robustness to artifacts to meet evolving
research and clinical requirements for noninvasive quantification of regional cerebral blood flow, next-generation
approaches leveraging deep machine learning and other improved computing hardware and algorithms are also
proposed to achieve higher spatial and temporal resolution, faster online image reconstructions, and improved
robustness to artifacts than are currently possible.
The proposed alliance will leverage the interdisciplinary expertise of the investigative team to provide a reliable,
reproducible, flexible and user friendly technology for quantifying a key parameter of brain health and function
that also has numerous clinical applications, including the evaluation of brain tumors and other organ systems.
The feasibility of the proposed work is supported by our preliminary data and track record of ASL MRI technology
development and dissemination."
10772079,"Project Summary/Abstract
There is an urgent need to develop novel therapies for patients with medulloblastoma (MB), the most common
malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumor in children. Current treatments include surgery, radiotherapy,
and chemotherapy and result in 5-year survival rates of 40-90% depending on subtype. However, children
suffer important morbidity secondary to treatment, including neurological, intellectual and physical disabilities.
The overall purpose of the present project is to investigate the role of the ADGRB3 receptor in susceptibility of
cerebellar transformation, and explore new therapies for MB based on the related mechanisms. ADGRB3 is an
orphan seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) specifically expressed in the brain, and
belonging to the adhesion-type sub-family. Our new preliminary data show that ADGRB3 expression is
significantly reduced in patients with MBs of the WNT group, and the promoter is epigenetically silenced,
suggesting that ADGRB3 loss may facilitate WNT-MB formation. We present evidence for the involvement of
methylated CpG binding protein MBD2 and histone methyltransferase EZH2 in switch to a silent chromatin.
Moreover, we show that reactivation of ADGRB3 can reduce cell proliferation and tumor growth, supporting a
tumor suppressive role. To test this in the physiological setting, we generated ADGRB3 knockout (KO) mice,
which we plan to cross with mice expressing mutant b-catenin in neural progenitors of the rhombic lip and
dorsal brainstem, which are the cells of origin of WNT-MB. Based on these results, we hypothesize that
ADGRB3 is a tumor suppressor in the cerebellum and that restoration of its expression with epigenetic therapy
may represent a novel therapeutic intervention for children with WNT-MB. To test our hypothesis, we propose
the following aims: (i) identify and target the epigenetic mechanism(s) underlying ADGRB3 gene silencing in
WNT-MB, (ii) determine whether and how restoration of ADGRB3 expression can inhibit MB cell growth,
oncogenic signaling and tumorigenic properties, and (iii) determine whether loss of ADGRB3 gene expression
in the background of oncogenic Ctnnb1 activation predisposes mice to cerebellar transformation and MB tumor
development. These studies are important as they increase our knowledge about developmental neurobiology
in the CNS, and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for patients with
medulloblastoma."

10748575,"Background: With the aging of the Veteran population, the demand for end-of-life (EOL) care,
including hospice services, is increasing. VA commits to ensuring that Veterans have access to
high-quality hospice in their setting of choice. In addition to home hospice services, VA offers to
provide hospice care within VA Community Living Centers (CLCs; i.e., VA nursing homes) or in
VA-contracted community nursing homes (CNHs). Until recently, little was known about the
quality of EOL care provided to Veterans receiving CNH-based hospice care. Our preliminary
work found that an alarmingly low percentage (58%) of family members of Veterans receiving
hospice in CNHs gave an “excellent” rating of the overall care received in the last 30 days of life
(compared to 83% of families of Veterans who received hospice in CLCs). We have also
observed significant variation across CNHs in quality of EOL care ratings.
Significance: CNHs are playing an increasingly critical role in VA’s commitment to ensuring
Veterans’ access to hospice care. A comprehensive understanding of the structures and
processes that underlie variation in quality of EOL care provided to Veterans receiving CNH-
based hospice is needed to illuminate levers for intervention to improve quality. Our study aligns
with HSR&D’s priority areas related to Community Care and Long-Term Care and Aging and
VA’s Strategic Plan that includes a key focus on “Aging, Frail, and End-of-Life Veterans.”
Innovation and Impact: Our application of positive deviance and machine learning methods to
identify factors underlying the quality of CNH-based hospice care are innovative contributions to
the field of EOL care research. Our findings have high potential for impact to guide VA
contracting decisions and the delivery of CNH-based hospice care to Veterans.
Specific Aims: 1) Examine the associations between CNH and hospice agency structural
characteristics, EOL care processes and bereaved family ratings of overall EOL care quality for
Veterans receiving hospice in CNHs; 2) Identify high- and low-performing CNHs based on the
BFS overall rating for Veterans who receive hospice; and determine the structures and EOL
care processes that are associated with high and low performance; 3) Explore bereaved family
member perceptions of the quality of EOL care for Veterans who received hospice in high- and
low-performing CNHs; and 4) Understand the delivery of CNH-based hospice care for Veterans
in high- and low-performing CNHs from the staff perspective.
Methodology: The project will employ a sequential explanatory mixed methods design. The
quantitative phase will use multi-level logistic regression models to understand the structural
characteristics and EOL care processes associated with BFS overall ratings (Aim 1) and a
machine learning approach to identify and study high- and low-performing CNHs based on BFS
ratings (Aim 2). The qualitative phase will deepen our understanding of the delivery of hospice
care in high- and low-performing CNHs using existing BFS data collected from bereaved family
members (Aim 3) and interviews with clinical staff and administrators (Aim 4).
Next Steps/Implementation: Findings will be used to refine VA’s CNH Dashboard that is used
to guide contracting decisions by incorporating EOL-focused measures. The study will also
create a Roadmap for Improving CNH-Based Hospice Care, including a Compendium of Best
Practices, that will inform quality improvement efforts and the development of a future
intervention study."

SUMMARY
Three different fates await the millions of critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units every year. Close to 30%
will recover without obvious sequelae, 15% succumb to the acute illness, and the remainder 55% will develop various
degrees of long-term impairments in cognitive, immune, cardiovascular, or renal functions, leading to increased overall
mortality. These sequelae are diagnosed under the umbrella term post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). We lack the
knowledge to improve acute survival, and to predict and treat PICS. Largely, therapies for septic shock and other critially
ill patients are limited to infectious source control and hemodynamic support. Severe systemic inflammatory reactions,
including sepsis, often lead to shock, organ failure and death, in part through an acute release of cytokines that promote
vascular dysfunction. The current body of work, including our own research, strongly argues for a critical role for the
endothelium in determining the outcomes of critical illness through expression of multiple proteins to promote
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, leukostasis and edema. However, simply blocking cytokine activity does not
improve survival, in large part due to the immunosuppresive actions of these treatments. It is imperative to rethink the
problem. We posit that a better understanding of the endothelial mechanisms downstream of cytokine signaling will lead
to improved therapies to prevent organ damage and mortality without interfering with the required pathogen clearance.
Little is known about the endothelial signaling pathways regulating the transcriptional profile in failing organs. This
proposal is designed to take full advantage of the innovative tools and knowledge we developed during the last several
years to ask fundamental mechanistic questions on the role of endothelial signaling and transcriptional responses during
severe inflammation. Sourcing of human primary endothelial cells in-house allows us to perform mechanistic studies in a
cost-effective manner, a panel of endothelial-specific transgenic mice enables us to study key regulators of transcription
in the context of multiorgan dysfunction, and clinical collaborators provide us with unique human specimens to ensure
the translatability of our research. Our prior findings of a critical role for the IL6-STAT3-SOCS3 signaling axis in the
endothelium provides a strong scientific basis for the proposed working model, and our new unpublished bioinformatics
analysis of endothelial translatome of failing organs suggest several novel IL6 effectors of endotheliopathy, providing
initial targets for further research. We aim at determining which changes dictate the severity of acute shock (and thus
short-term survival), and which lead to long-term consequences well beyond the resolution of the initial shock. Key
questions driving our research are: 1) What are the effectors downstream of a cytokine storm that we can target to limit
organ dysfunction without limiting the immune response? 2) What are the main drivers of long-term consequences and
chronic inflammation after shock recovery? 3) How can we take advantage of the complexity of the endothelial response
to tailor it towards a pro-immune response while limiting the collateral damage? The outcome of our efforts in
answering these critical questions is the discovery of key determinants of organ failure. The knowledge gained may lead
to innovative non-immunosuppressive therapeutic strategies to limit organ dysfunction."

10773192,"Project 001 (273): Molecular -Scale Mapping of Rhodopsin Trafficking in Mammalian Rod Photoreceptors,
Robichaux, PL
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 In rod photoreceptor neurons of the vertebrate retina, rhodopsin (Rho) is the light-sensing, G protein-
coupled receptor that is densely packaged into stacks of membrane discs within a specialized sensory cilium
known as the outer segment. Rods continuously renew these discs, and so an enormous amount of Rho protein
must be constantly synthesized and trafficked to the outer segment in each rod. To maintain this heavy
biosynthesis of Rho, rods feature a highly regulated yet ill-characterized secretory and trafficking network. Rho
trafficking in rod neurons is such an essential task that, when disrupted, it causes blinding retinal diseases such
as retinitis pigmentosa. Recent evidence in mammalian rod photoreceptors suggest alternate, unconventional
pathways for Rho trafficking; however, these pathways remain undiscovered. Another understudied component
of Rho trafficking in rods is the essential structural waypoint known as the basal body, which is located at the
critical boundary between the biosynthetic zone of rods and the thin connecting cilium bridge that leads to the
outer segment. The basal body is composed of two centrioles that have associated sub-structures, including the
centriolar satellites and distal appendages. These are each potential sites of Rho interaction and docking before
transport into the outer segment; however, these structures have also not been rigorously studied in mammalian
rods to date. Our preliminary data using advanced, super-resolution microscopy methods indicate that Rho
molecules are densely accumulated in the basal body, and that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes may
also be located at the basal body. In the first aim of this proposal, we will first test if nascent Rho protein is being
synthesized in local ER membranes within the basal body region of mammalian rods as part of a potential
alternate Rho trafficking pathway. We will generate a novel knock-in ER fusion mouse to perform a
comprehensive, super-resolution mapping of the entire local ER network in rods. We will quantitatively map onto
this ER network the precise localization of Rho proteins, ribosomes (as rough ER), and Rho mRNA as sites for
local Rho translation. Collectively, these experiments will define new Rho trafficking events and establish a new
local ER network within the rod basal body. In our second aim, we will use complimentary approaches to test if
Rho proteins dock onto the basal body at the centriolar satellites and distal appendages via specific protein-
protein interactions with the component proteins of those two basal body sub-structures. We will perform a
rigorous nanoscale mapping of these structures in mouse rods, followed by a quantitative test of Rho co-
localization with the component proteins of the satellites and the distal appendages. We will corroborate these
new interactions with biochemical co-precipitation assays. Finally, we will perform a novel, targeted inhibition of
the satellites and distal appendages, by subretinal delivery of viral vectors carrying machinery to genetically
disrupt these structures in mouse rods. With these experiments, we will establish the role of these basal body
structures in Rho trafficking and rod photoreceptor homeostasis."
10773198,"Project 003 (486): Investigating Novel Transcriptional Mechanisms for Visual Neural Circuit Development and
Function using Zebrafish, Bergeron, PL
PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Neuroanatomical and behavioral changes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as eye tracking
dysfunction in schizophrenia, are caused by unknown genetic mechanisms. Identifying these critical gene
networks for sensory motor responsiveness in the visual system is one key to developing targeted early
diagnostic and preventative strategies for the symptoms of these disorders that make the world a difficult place
to navigate for those afflicted by them. My long-term goal is to characterize causative genetic mechanisms for
neurodevelopmental disorders-related phenotypes using zebrafish as a model system. This powerful genetic
model provides a unique opportunity as an easily accessible vertebrate with a comparatively “simple” nervous
system, rapid neurodevelopment, many orthologues of human disease-related genes, and defined and tractable
behavioral responses to visual stimuli. We can begin to study specific classes of neurons based on their
molecular identity and function from the moment that they are born in the embryo through adulthood in rapid
time compared to other vertebrate models. My previous work and that of others revealed for the first time the
molecular identity of key interneurons that mediate sensory processing and reflexive control in the mouse and
zebrafish auditory system. These neurons express the transcription factor Genomic Screen Homeobox 1 (Gsx1),
and I sought to determine the role that Gsx1 plays in the development of neural circuits for sensory processing
across the CNS. Upon examination of targeted gsx1 zebrafish mutants, we found profound defects in neuronal
differentiation and axon guidance in the developing visual system. Despite its documented expression in the
developing visual system in mouse and zebrafish, no research has been performed to date to examine the role
that Gsx1 plays in development and function of visual neural circuits. Given the importance of transcriptional
mechanisms for neural circuit development in sensory systems and the proposed ability to target key players in
these large gene networks to treat diseases, we seek to fill this gap in knowledge. Aim 1 of this proposal will
determine the consequences of mutating gsx1 on innate visually mediated behaviors and cell fate determination
in the zebrafish pretectum and the eye. The experiments described in Aim 2 will identify the cellular mechanisms
by which Gsx1 regulates arborization of axons in the pretectum that connect the eyes to the brain. We will be
able to perform these experiments and analyze and validate the large amount of data that will be generated
under the expert guidance of the Visual Function & Morphology Core, as well as the WVU Genomics Core Facility
and the Bioinformatics Core Facility. This research will provide insight into the complex genetic etiology of
neurodevelopmental disorders in which patients have comorbid defects in sensory processing. In addition, our
studies will provide an abundance of data that can be utilized to support future research projects that align well
with the development of visual function."
10773199,"Project 004 (459): Influence of Ocular Biomechanics on Optic Nerve Head Perfusion, Palko, PL
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Intraocular pressure (IOP), the only known
modifiable risk factor for glaucoma, is established as a causative variable in the death of retinal ganglion cells at
the optic nerve head (ONH). However, it remains to be discovered how IOP interacts with the ONH to produce
glaucomatous damage. Evidence suggests that IOP produces direct mechanical damage to the ONH and
hypoxic damage by a reduction in blood flow to the ONH. There is a gap in our current understanding of how
mechanical deformations of the ONH connective tissue during elevations in IOP influence the vasculature that
resides within this ocular region. The hypothesis of this proposal is that eyes that demonstrate greater tissue
compression within and around the ONH will demonstrate a greater reduction in ONH perfusion velocity during
elevations of IOP. To test this hypothesis, we have developed novel ultrasound imaging techniques that permit
the colocalization of measurements of tissue strain (deformation) and perfusion velocity within the region of the
ONH, where glaucomatous damage occurs. The proposed aims will demonstrate the degree to which ONH
connective tissue strain influences the perfusion rates to the ONH and determine if chemically stiffening the
sclera around the ONH will improve perfusion during IOP elevations. Preliminary results using an innovative
imaging system have shown localized strain within regions of the perineural sclera containing arterioles that
supply the ONH. These initial studies demonstrate the ability of this technique to measure the perfusion velocity
within the depth of the lamina cribrosa, a region of the eye that cannot be measured using current optical
methods. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the interplay between ocular perfusion pressure, perfusion velocity and tissue
strain magnitudes while determining if stiffening of the peripapillary sclera improves ONH perfusion. In Aim 2, a
rodent model with a controlled IOP elevation will be used to ascertain the in vivo effect of peripapillary scleral
stiffening on ONH perfusion and axonal transport blockade. This information will further our understanding of
glaucoma pathophysiology and examine a potential pre-clinical treatment strategy for glaucomatous eyes with
reduced perfusion pressures. This research plan was developed with the assistance and support of a
multidisciplinary team of mentors. The professional development and preliminary data gained during this award
period will enable me to achieve my career goal as a physician-scientist with an independent R01-funded award
in this field of ocular research."
10774294,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic alcohol use disrupts a number of cognitive functions, including attention, memory, flexibility, and other
aspects of executive control. This is exacerbated by both exogenous stress and stress associated with alcohol
use and withdrawal. We hypothesize that a key factor relating widespread cognitive dysfunction to problematic
alcohol use is cognitive effort, which is needed to sustain diverse cognitive functions, particularly under
conditions of heavy demand. In particular, we hypothesize that a history of chronic alcohol and stress disrupts
the willingness and ability to exert cognitive effort, and conversely, that pre-alcohol limitations in cognitive effort
predict future problematic alcohol use. There is strong interest in the neural basis of cognitive effort, but to our
knowledge, no studies have examined the relationship between cognitive effort and alcohol at either a behavioral
or neural level. Here we will investigate a neural circuit critical for cognitive effort and impacted by stress and
alcohol use. This circuit is formed by the locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) system, its strong projections
to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and ACC projections to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS). Unique to this
proposal is 1) the integration of these systems into a unified circuit and 2) the investigation of this circuit in the
integrated framework of cognitive effort, alcohol, and stress.
We will measure the impact of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) and/or forced swim stress (FSS) on willingness
and ability to perform two cognitively-demanding tasks (extradimensional set shifting and cognitive effort
discounting in a sustained attention task) in mice. We will identify CIE/FSS associated changes in ACC
noradrenergic regulation using RNAscope and probe them with CRISPR-mediated NE receptor knockdown (Aim
1). We will record neural dynamics in this network during cognitive performance after CIE/FSS (Aim 2), and
manipulate the activity of this circuit using optogenetics to reversibly disrupt or rescue cognitive effort (Aim 3).
Finally, we will collaborate with INIA Neuroimmune investigators to identify the impact of the phosphodiesterase
inhibitor apremilast on cognitive function after CIE/FSS and characterize its effect in this circuit (Aim 4). Studies
will integrate individual and sex differences to capitalize on heterogeneity in behavior and its relationship to
underlying neural function.
Cognitive effort is a novel and powerful framework for investigating the impact of alcohol and stress on cognition.
Our studies have the potential to unite diverse findings related to the cognition and AUD. By identifying changes
in neural circuitry underlying CIE/FSS-induced changes in cognitive effort, there is significant potential for
identifying broadly-influential treatments for AUD that strengthen cognitive abilities to serve as a bulwark against
the combined influences of alcohol and stress."

10771351,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Advanced age renders humans susceptible to cancer, fatal infection, neurodegeneration and cardiovascular
disease. Age-related immunodeficiency combines loss of protective immunity with gain in tissue inflammation,
indicating the complex restructuring of the innate and adaptive immune system with age. An informative model
system for immune aging is the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis, in which T cells age prematurely by
about 25 years and are key effector cells in tissue-destructive inflammation. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis,
CD4+ T cells transition into pro-inflammatory effector cells due to defective mitochondria, resulting in poor
ATP production, citric acid cycle reversal, and mitochondrial DNA seepage. In preliminary studies, we have
discovered that mitochondrial malfunction is associated with the leakage of N-terminal formyl-methionine
(f-Met) from the mitochondrial matrix, eliciting a strong innate immune response in surrounding macrophages
and stromal cells. f-Met is the first amino acid in all bacterial and mitochondrial proteins and, as a bacterial motif,
is a powerful danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) triggering innate immunity. CD4+ T cells from older
individuals leak f-Met due to inappropriate opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore
(mPTP), a high conductance channel that secures the containment of solutes in the mitochondrial matrix. We
found that inappropriate pore opening and f-Met leakage have profound consequences for T cell differentiation
and effector functions. Specifically, we have placed f-Met release across the inner mitochondrial membrane
upstream of the T cell’s proteolytic machinery; with cytosolic f-Met minimizing lysosomal degradation and
optimizing exosome formation. Essentially, leaky mitochondria turn f-Met-secreting older T cells into
exosome superproducers. Here, we propose that the mitochondrial DAMP f-Met is a biomarker of T cell
aging and a drugable target to mitigate immune aging in older populations. To pursue this hypothesis, we
will map the molecular defects causing N-formyl-methionine leakage in CD4+ T cells of older individuals (Aim1),
determine how cytosolic f-Met regulates lysosomal function and exosome generation (Aim2), and define the pro-
inflammatory functions of f-Met-induced exosomes in T cell-macrophage and T cell-fibroblast interaction (Aim3).
To leverage molecular understanding of mitochondrial abnormalities in aged T cells, we have assembled a series
of targeted small molecule reagents that we will test for their ability to suppress and reverse pro-
inflammatory T cell effector functions in vivo (Aim4). This proposal aims to define and manipulate biological
processes underlying age-related mitochondrial failure with the goal to ameliorate or delay aging-induced tissue
inflammation and develop molecular cues of mitochondrial aging into actionable biomarkers of immune aging."

Alternative splicing is an RNA processing mechanism that explains how single genes can produce more than
one transcript. Alternative splicing is a rule rather than an exception: in humans, more than 90% of genes
undergo alternative splicing, consistent with the increased cellular and functional complexity of higher
eukaryotes. Genome wide studies keep identifying multiple splice variants for thousands of genes but how they
differentially or similarly function in the cells is an arena that only few groups get into. The splicing field is heavily
focused on how alternative splicing is regulated for example by RBPs, transcription, or epigenetics components.
In contrast, how alternative splicing impacts protein function and physiology is a much less investigated area.
After our current NIGMS R01 ends, this MIRA/R35 will greatly help us keep building our research program in
this niche.
 Our lab is interested on how alternative splicing influences key cellular process such as membrane trafficking,
cytoskeleton dynamics, transcription, local translation, and phase separation in large, highly specialized cells
such as cardiomyocytes and myofibers. We are curious of how this interplay impacts organ physiology, and how
similar or different this is in other type of large, highly specialized cells such as neurons that exert very different
roles in our bodies. Our MIRA proposal will tackle this broad interest from three Angles, that are independent
from each other but at the same time will synergize our discoveries. Angle 1 will study how RNA processing
regulates cytoskeleton dynamics in skeletal muscle cells which are also highly mechanosensitive. This is
significant because muscle diseases caused by aberrant RNA processing show intracellular architecture and
mechanical defects. Angle 2 will examine the contribution of alternative splicing to phase separation and local
translation. This is significant because skeletal muscle cells are syncytial tubes with numerous nuclei that need
to coordinate transcription within nuclei and translation in their shared cytoplasm. Angle 3 will define the role of
splicing on regulating transcription. This is significant because transcription factors and chromatin regulators
control thousands of downstream programs that in turn drive cellular differentiation, cell fate, and tissue function.
Overall, our MIRA research will build mechanistic and physiological models of how RNA processing drives organ
development and tissue identity acquisition and maintenance.
 Finally, the MIRA format will give us flexibility to investigate our broad question and allow more time for: (a)
creativity, (b) thinking outside the box and at the frontiers of the field, (c) mentoring and training young scientists,
especially women and underrestended scholars, and (d) promoting diversity, inclusion, and equity in our field,
academia, and the society."
10774300,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Ever since forming a symbiotic relationship with the eukaryotic host 2 billion years ago, mitochondria have
become integral components of the cellular network. Thanks to the resurgence of interest in mitochondria, there
is a greater appreciation for the wide variety of cellular and physiological functions for these organelles beyond
their role in energy generation. Despite this renewed interest, however, research into the mitochondrial genome
(mtDNA) has lagged. Multiple factors likely contribute to this underappreciation for mtDNA, including its
diminutive size and small genetic content, the difficulty of genetically manipulating it in metazoans, and its ‘messy’
genetics, which stands in stark contrast to the simple and elegant mendelian genetics of the nuclear genome.
Consequently, fundamental questions pertaining to mtDNA biology remain unaddressed. It is a mistake,
however, to view mtDNA as simple and inconsequential vestiges of mitochondria’s ancestral past. Devastating
diseases caused by mtDNA mutations serve as important reminders of its functional relevance. The overarching
goal of research in my lab over the coming five years is to study mtDNA genetics, and mtDNA biology more
broadly. Replication of mtDNA is not confined to the cell cycle and can occur continuously throughout the life of
the cells. Consequently, new mutations can arise frequently, contributing to a state of heteroplasmy, in which
two or more sequence variants of mtDNA coexist. Because cells are polyploid for mtDNA, containing hundreds
to thousands of copies, mutations are scored as the percentage of mtDNA copies that are mutant (i.e.
heteroplasmy levels). Even highly deleterious mtDNA mutations are benign at low heteroplasmy levels. However,
they become pathogenic when their levels rise beyond a critical threshold and there are insufficient copies of the
normal mtDNA to support cellular function. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that impact heteroplasmy
levels are poorly understood. Consequently, it is difficult to predict who will inherit or develop mtDNA-associated
diseases. The first major goal of my lab is to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms that modulate
heteroplasmy dynamics. We have adapted C. elegans as a model system of choice to study these mechanisms.
C. elegans allows us to track heteroplasmy levels across individuals and generations with unprecedented
feasibility. The ability of mtDNA mutants to rise in heteroplasmy levels beyond the critical threshold are mutant-
specific. However, the mechanistic basis for this specificity is not well understood. Consequently, the second
major goal of my lab is to utilize a diverse panel of mutations to explain the differences in their heteroplasmy
levels. Taken together, our research program tackles long-standing but fundamental questions in the field of
mitochondrial genetics. In the process, we will also gain insights into broader aspects of mtDNA biology such as
its replication and how cells count mtDNA copies."

10775710,"Project Summary
Despite advances in anti-androgen and taxane-based therapies, prostate cancer (PC) often becomes
castration-resistant, metastatic, and incurable. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop novel
interventions to treat metastatic PC. Lipid signaling and metabolism are major drivers of PC metastasis and
present ideal targets for therapeutic intervention. However, therapeutic exploitation of lipid signaling systems is
hampered by the existence of multiple lipid metabolizing enzymes and nuclear receptors, which would
necessitate targeting these systems in parallel. Fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) is an intracellular carrier
that shuttles bioactive lipids to nuclear receptors, thereby activating gene transcription programs that enhance
tumor growth and metastasis. FABP5 is not expressed in the normal prostate but becomes highly upregulated
in advanced metastatic PC. Our group has obtained preliminary data demonstrating that FABP5 is
indispensable for the delivery of pro-tumorigenic lipids produced by multiple cytosolic to nuclear receptors to
promote PC metastasis. This positions FABP5 as an essential node in a PC lipid signaling network and an
attractive target for the development of therapeutics to treat metastatic PC. Despite the considerable promise
of FABP5 inhibitors as potential PC therapeutics, potent and selective inhibitors have yet to emerge. The major
goal of this proposal is to develop and optimize novel potent and selective FABP5 inhibitors. The proposed
multidisciplinary project will be carried out by a highly qualified team with expertise in computer-aided drug
design, medicinal chemistry, and PC biology. Aim 1 will leverage structure-based drug design and iterative
chemical synthesis approaches to identify and optimize FABP5 inhibitors for potency and selectivity. Aim 2 will
employ a robust in vitro inhibitor testing platform including assessments of inhibitor potency, efficacy,
selectivity, stability, and cytotoxicity in PC cell-lines and non-transformed cells. Aim 3 will assess the efficacy of
candidate inhibitors in mouse models of PC, including a novel genetically engineered mouse model of
androgen-dependent and castration-resistant PC. We will also assess the efficacy of FABP5 inhibitors when
used as monotherapies and in combination with FDA approved therapeutics. Successful completion of the
proposed studies will lead to the development of optimized FABP5 inhibitor scaffolds that can be advanced to
late stage IND-enabling studies and eventual clinical deployment."

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for ≈50% of all patients with heart failure, and is
associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditures. Yet, no effective treatment for
HFpEF has been identified. Commonly coexisting with other metabolic diseases, HFpEF is considered the
cardiovascular manifestation of a systemic metabolic disturbance. However, little is known about its underlying
mechanisms. Our laboratory recently developed and validated a novel mouse model that faithfully recapitulates
most clinical features of human HFpEF. Using this novel mouse model, I discovered significant mitochondrial
dysfunction in HFpEF myocardium, which is associated with mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation, a key post-
translational modification known to regulate enzymatic activities. This led to our central hypothesis that protein
hyperacetylation is a reversible driver of mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic remodeling in HFpEF and could
serve as a meaningful therapeutic target. In this proposal, we aim to (1) Determine the role of Sirtuin 3, the major
mitochondrial deacetylase, in regulating mitochondrial function and HFpEF pathogenesis; (2) Identify specific
targets through which hyperacetylation impacts mitochondrial function in HFpEF; (3) Determine the therapeutic
effect of modulating protein acetylation on HFpEF mitochondrial function and cardiac phenotype. Collectively,
these studies will have a meaningful impact on our understanding of HFpEF pathophysiology and potentially
unveil novel therapy to effectively treat HFpEF. Furthermore, work proposed here, coupled with a comprehensive
training plan, will provide me with the additional knowledge and skills required to launch my career as a

10764520,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Metabolic pathways function in response to cellular needs, but they also can direct signaling and even
influence how our genes are read. If we can understand the underlying mechanisms of metabolic-dependent
signaling, it could broaden the range of interventions when combatting diseases to include modulation of cell
metabolism. It is currently challenging to accurately measure concentrations and fluctuations of the metabolic
intermediates that participate in these signaling pathways. By understanding the intracellular concentrations
and regulation of these signaling metabolites, we can determine how the availability of a specific metabolite is
poised to impact enzymatic activity, as well as the extent and timing that their levels may fluctuate over the
course of physiology and disease. These metabolites are highly compartmentalized even within individual
cells, and an accurate measurement for signaling needs to distinguish its free concentration from bound pools.
Moreover, signaling metabolites often have distinct roles in different parts of the cells and their concentrations
can be differentially regulated. We are deconvoluting the signaling roles of metabolites by developing small
single-fluorescent protein biosensors that are genetically encoded and selective for specific intracellular
metabolites. These sensors can be localized subcellularly and measured changes in their fluorescence reflect
changes in concentration for specific intermediary metabolites. Together the data will determine how that
metabolite regulates signaling. In this proposal, we use mitochondrial NAD+ sensors to elucidate the
mechanisms of transport for human mitochondrial carrier family member, SLC25A51, and determine its roles in
disease. We also develop new sensors to expand our investigations to additional signaling metabolites,
including NAD-derived metabolites."

Three percent of liveborn babies in the US have a major structural birth defect. The emotional, psychological
and economic impact of birth defects on families, society and the healthcare system is significant. Inpatient
hospitalization costs associated with birth defects for children and adults with birth defects in the US in 2013 was
$22.9 billion, which was 3% of all hospitalizations and 5% of total hospital costs. Children who survive infancy
with a major birth defect have a high risk of other chronic short- and long-term health conditions and diminished
quality of life. Although birth defects pose a significant public health challenge, public heath efforts to prevent
most birth defects are limited. About 70% of cases of birth defects have unknown causes but are thought to arise
from complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors. Thus, studies are needed to identify risk
factors that can be modified to ultimately prevent birth defects. The long-term goal of our research is to determine
the etiology birth defects and long-term health effects of teratogens and birth defects on maternal, and child
health and development. The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate the multifactorial etiology of
structural birth defects. The rationale for this project is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
launched 2 multisite, population-based, case-control studies, the National Birth Defects Prevention Study
(NBDPS), which ended in 2013 and the Birth Defects STudy to Evaluate Pregnancy exposureS (BD-STEPS)
which began in 2014. The Arkansas Center for Birth Defects Research and Prevention, a site in the NBDPS for
16 years and a site in BD STEPS for 9 years, proposes to attain the objective through 4 specific aims: (1) identify
and characterize pregnancies affected by specific birth defects and livebirths without major birth defects to
participate as a Center in BD-STEPS; (2) conduct collaborative and local epidemiologic studies using NBDPS,
BD-STEPS, and other data sources to identify potentially modifiable risk factors for specific birth defects; (3)
conduct collaborative and local genetic and epigenetic studies using genetic data from the NBDPS, BD-STEPS,
and other sources to identify genetic or gene-environment factors associated with birth defects; and (4) train and
mentor the next generation of research scientists in birth defects epidemiology, implementation, conduct and
analysis of population-based research. Our statewide population-based birth defects registry, sole academic
health center, sole tertiary pediatric hospital, central health department and diverse high-risk population of
reproductive age women, make Arkansas an ideal site for BD-STEPS. Through our continued participation in
BD-STEPS, we will maintain a leading role in identifying modifiable risk factors that can be used to develop public
health strategies to prevent birth defects."

Currently, no licensed plague vaccines are available in Western world. Isolation of virulent F1-negative Y.
pestis strains from natural sources and the existence of lcrV polymorphisms in Yersinia may result in Y. pestis

Chronic pain, a complex multidimensional disorder, remains a major health care issue and a therapeutic challenge. The
development of new and improved therapeutic strategies requires the full understanding of mechanisms of chronic pain
at all levels of the neuraxis and for all cell types, including non-neuronal elements. Neuroimmune signaling has emerged
as a peripheral and spinal pain mechanism, but little is known about the role, regulation and therapeutic potential of
molecular crosstalk between neuronal and glial cell types in the brain in the context of pain. To address this important
knowledge gap we will build on our NIH-funded work (since 1999) that impacted the field by identifying neuroplasticity
in the amygdala, a brain center for emotions, as a critical mechanism for emotional-affective aspects of pain and pain
modulation. The proposed project will test the novel hypothesis that chronification of amygdala plasticity and
neuropathic pain behaviors depends on a cascade of neuroimmune signaling that can be targeted to mitigate
neuropathic pain. Specifically, enhanced synaptic drive of certain amygdala neuron types at the acute pain stage
activates different types of glia, and glia-derived factors generate hyperexcitability in distinct amygdala neuron types at
the chronic stage to maintain neuropathic pain. A comprehensive multidisciplinary approach will be used that
integrates state-of-the-art transcriptomics, bioinformatics, behavioral assays, brain slice electrophysiology,
pharmacology, chemogenetics, optogenetics, viral vector strategies, immunohistochemistry and molecular biology for
the analysis of neuroimmune interactions within and between different types of neuronal and glial cells in the amygdala
output region (central nucleus, CeA) in the well-established spinal nerve ligation (SNL) rat model of neuropathic pain.
Male and female rats will be studied. A transgenic Crh-Cre rat model will be used to study the CeA corticotropin
releasing factor (CRF) system, an important player in amygdala plasticity, and its role in neuroimmune signaling. Aim 1
will use a combination of cell-specific bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to identify individual genes,
molecular pathways and functional cellular states associated with pain chronification. A novel computational scRNA-Seq-
based interactome analysis will determine neuron-glia interactions at the acute and chronic stages of neuropathic pain
and identify drug-targetable molecular factors. Aim 2 will determine the behavioral significance of neuron-glia-neuron
signaling in the CeA at different stages of neuropathic pain, using chemogenetic activation and inhibition of different cell
types and pharmacological (or viral based) tools to modulate molecular factors. Sensory thresholds, emotional
responses, non-evoked ongoing pain, and anxiety- and depression-like behaviors will be measured. Aim 3 will determine
electrophysiological mechanisms of neuron-glia-neuron signaling in the CeA at different stages of neuropathic pain,
using patch-clamp recordings of different cell types in brain slices and chemogenetic and pharmacological (or viral
based) manipulations. Successful completion of these conceptually innovative studies will significantly advance our
knowledge of neuro-immune signaling in brain plasticity and in the transition from acute to chronic pain and provide
novel targets to mitigate chronic neuropathic pain."

The goal of this K25 Mentored Quantitative Research Development Award project is to allow the PI to obtain
systematic training in toxicology and prepare the PI to become an independent investigator. A research project
complement the proposal’s comprehensive career development plan that promotes the PI’s research career.
Human health risk assessment of chemical exposures is an important form of preventive medicine. Health risk
assessment has been widely applied in both industry and government to evaluate the potential human toxicity
of chemicals to properly protect human and environmental health. Modern toxicological science has provided
scientists new tools to dissect and understand the biological adverse pathways underlying toxicity. This
provides a great opportunity for risk assessment to characterize the dose-response relationship across the
entire dose continuum (especially in the low-dose region) and may significantly improve the plausibility and
accuracy of dose-response assessment. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a methodological
framework that integrates mechanistic plausibility, experimental data, and uncertainty and variability into dose-
response analysis in support of probabilistic carcinogen risk assessment. The objective of this project is to
combine evidence from a sequence of events following a plausible mode of action to quantitatively
characterize dose-response relationship across the entire dose continuum for liver carcinogenicity with non-
mutagenic modes of action (MOAs). The central hypothesis is that liver carcinogens sharing the same MOA
may have a similar shape of dose-response relationship which can be characterized by synthesizing evidence
of a series of key and associative events. To achieve the objective, three specific aims will be pursued: (1)
employ and improve existing framework to identify key and associative events with available data to
understand mode of action of liver carcinogenesis; (2) develop a modeling framework to quantitatively integrate
MOA information to characterize the dose-response relationship across the dose continuum; and (3) apply the
framework to different non-mutagenic MOA for liver carcinogenicity and evaluate its feasibility and plausibility.
The proposed methodological framework is highly innovative because it aims at quantitatively characterizing
dose-response relationship across the whole dose continuum without dichotomizing the extrapolation method
into linear vs. nonlinear (i.e., threshold). The success of the proposed methodological framework may
revolutionarily change the current practice in dose-response assessment and significantly advance the science
of chemical risk assessment by providing more scientifically plausible probabilistic risk estimation to support
risk management."
10757467,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genomic structural variants (SV) involving deletions, duplications, insertions, inversions, and translocations of
sequences are an abundant source of genetic variation. SVs have been linked to Mendelian diseases, as well
as complex heritable diseases like schizophrenia, and cancer. However, recent comparisons of extremely
contiguous genome assemblies of humans and model organism Drosophila melanogaster have revealed that
common genotyping strategies relying on high throughput short reads miss 40-80% of SVs, including those
affecting phenotypes. Thus, contribution of SVs towards diseases and phenotypic variation remain grossly
underestimated. To accurately measure the contribution of SVs towards deleterious genetic variation and trait
variation, we propose to create a comprehensive map of genomewide SVs via comparison of extremely
contiguous genome assemblies. However, contiguous de novo assembly of human genomes with high
coverage (>50X) noisy long reads remains prohibitively expensive. So I propose to analyze SVs in the 25-fold
smaller genome of model organism D. melanogaster, which has contributed substantially to our understanding
of the genetics of complex human diseases. The proposed research aims to study fitness effects of
polymorphic SVs based on de novo genome assemblies of 50 genetically diverse D. melanogaster strains that
are as complete and contiguous as the current D. melanogaster reference genome – arguably the best
metazoan genome assembly (Aim 1). I propose to use this comprehensive set of variants to infer the
distribution of fitness effects of the SVs and to estimate the proportion of adaptive SVs, both of which are
reliable proxies for the evolutionary and functional significance of SVs (Aim 1). Aim 1 will involve training in
theory and cutting edge methods in molecular population genetics. Next, the proposed project will develop an
experimental approach to determine the fitness effects of variants for which an organismal phenotype is
unknown. As part of this, the proposed project will develop genome editing resources that will facilitate rapid
transformation of one of our sequenced strains with SVs, so that fitness effects of candidate SVs from trait
mapping studies can be examined (Aim 2). Training in Aim 2 includes development of CRISPR-Cas9 toolkit in
a common genetic background to investigate the functional effects of SVs. Finally, using the toolkit developed
in Aim 2, we propose to conduct high throughput fitness assays to evaluate the selective effects of SVs under
specific selection conditions (Aim 3). The training portion of the proposed research will complement the
applicant’s previous experience and position him for a successful research career. University of California
Irvine and the Emerson and Long labs together have the resources and expertise to ensure the successful
completion of the training phase of the grant."
10745700,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Essential tremor (ET) is the most common tremor disorder, affecting 2.2% of the total US population. ET is also
a progressive disorder, with tremor becoming more severe over time. Despite its high prevalence, therapeutic
options for ET are far from satisfactory, in part due to an unclear understanding of disease mechanisms,
leaving many patients disabled. Through long-term NIH funded efforts to collect postmortem ET brains, we
have identified morphological changes in the ET cerebellum that reflect cellular damage in Purkinje cells (PCs).
Recent converging evidence of genetics and neuropathology has identified a role for abnormal endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) calcium handling in ET. Specifically, a key ER calcium channel called ryanodine receptor type 1
(RyR1), which is expressed in PCs in cerebellar cortex, undergoes site-specific phosphorylation and in this
state becomes leaky. We found that ET cerebellum has markedly increased levels of phosphorylated RyR1,
which is not seen in control or Parkinson’s cerebellum, creating a chronic ER calcium leak state in the ET
cerebellum. We established a mouse model harboring a point mutation in RyR1 that mimics constitutive site-
specific phosphorylation, recapitulating the RyR1 leaky phenotype (RyR1-S2844D “leaky” mice), and this
mouse model develops altered cerebellar physiology and progressive ET-like tremor. These findings support
that abnormal ER calcium handling contributes to tremor. However, the detailed mechanism how abnormal ER
calcium handling leads to tremor and whether its manipulation can be used to treat tremor remains unclear,
which is a major obstacle for therapy development. Towards solving this knowledge gap, we propose to test
the hypothesis that dysfunctional ER calcium handling leads to structural and physiological alterations in
cerebellum that drive tremor. In the proposed five year study, we will use both mouse models (Aim 1, Aim 2)
and postmortem human ET brains (Aim 3) to address the role of ER calcium handling for tremor generation:
Aim 1: We will determine how specific structural and physiological changes in cerebellar PCs of RyR1-leaky
mice play a role in tremor emergence and progression. Aim 2: We will determine if bi-directional modulation of
ER calcium handling alters PC physiology and tremor in RyR1-leaky mice and examine the PC specificity of
these alterations. Aim 3: We will determine whether the upstream regulators for RyR1 biochemical remodeling
and the degree of RyR1 leakiness are altered in the postmortem human ET cerebellum and correlate these
metrics with tremor severity and PC pathologic changes. These data will advance our understanding of ET
from observational studies into mechanistic insight, which will serve as scientific rationale for therapy
development."
10880588,"Studies in animal models linked gestational exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with the
onset of disease in exposed and unexposed descendants. Many groups found such transgenerational effects
of chemical exposures, which were proposed to be examples of epigenetic inheritance. Transgenerational
effects of environmental exposures have substantial support in the literature. Yet the concept that responses to
environmental exposures can be transmitted to subsequent generations through the germline without DNA
mutations remains controversial because the underlying mechanisms have not been explained satisfactorily.
Understanding how effects of environmental exposures are transmitted to unexposed generations without DNA
mutations is a fundamental, unanswered question in biology. We developed a highly reproducible animal
model for transgenerational inheritance of obesity. When pregnant F0 mouse dams were treated with
environmentally-relevant (nM) doses of TBT via their drinking water throughout gestation, increased fat
accumulation was detected in F1-F4 generation male descendants. Affected TBT-group males developed a
transgenerational “thrifty phenotype”: they were resistant to fat loss during fasting, rapidly gained weight when
dietary fat was increased and retained this fat even after being returned to a normal, low-fat diet. Our published
and preliminary results led us to propose a new model for transgenerational inheritance - that prenatal TBT
exposure altered higher-order chromatin structure (HOCS), changing secondary epigenetic modifiers that
inhibited expression of insulin degrading enzyme (Ide) causing diet-induced hyperinsulinemia and obesity.
Here we propose a comprehensive series of experiments designed to determine exactly how exposure of
pregnant F0 dams to TBT alters HOCS in F1-F3 primordial germ cells (PGCs), why these changes are
inherited, rather than reversed to the normal state, how these changes affect lower-level epigenetic regulators
controlling expression of Ide and why does the phenotype only occur in males. Aim 1 will identify mechanisms
that drive changes HOCS near the Ide gene and how these interact with lower-level epigenetic regulators to
modulate Ide expression in the adult liver. Aim 2 tests whether epigenetic interventions, such as dissolving the
HOCS alterations or releasing Ide expression from repression in PGCs or adults can prevent or reverse the
transgenerational predisposition to male-specific metabolic phenotypes. Deciphering the underlying
mechanisms will have profound implications for how the field views transgenerational inheritance and how
future experiments are planned and conducted. This new understanding will be critical to explaining the
etiology of non-communicable diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, targeting their causes and
ameliorating their effects. Our results will have broad implications for understanding epigenetic transmission of
the effects of environmental stressors and could offer opportunities to incorporate considering prevention of
transgenerational inheritance into risk assessment paradigms."
10757688,"Alcohol abuse is a leading cause of disease and death in the United States. Alcohol consumption impairs lung
defense and increases the risk of bacterial pneumonia. Alcohol users with pneumonia respond poorly to
antibiotics, experience more severe symptoms and higher rates of mortality. Mucociliary clearance (MCC) is a
primary lung defense mechanism against inhaled/aspirated pathogens and is impaired by excessive alcohol
use. Unfortunately, our limited understanding of alcohol effects has prevented the development of interventions
to reverse mucociliary dysfunction and augment host immunity against infections.
Recently, we reported that alcohol reduces ion transport function of CFTR, the defective channel that
causes cystic fibrosis lung disease, which is also characterized by diminished MCC and frequent infections.
Supporting this discovery, patients with alcohol-induced pancreatitis (another disorder that is causally linked
with CFTR defects) were found to exhibit lower CFTR activity even after they abstained from drinking. Of note,
these patients had normal CFTR genetics excluding the role of inherited defects and thus, confirming the
phenomenon of ‘acquired CFTR dysfunction’.
Our preliminary studies in rat model of chronic alcohol administration detected substantially reduced
CFTR ion transport, increased mucus viscosity and, dramatically decreased MCC. When compared to their
pair-fed controls, alcohol-treated rats failed to clear Klebsiella pneumoniae and, exhibited histopathologic
evidence of severe pneumonia. Our data indicate alcohol increases the activity of phosphodiesterase-4B
(PDE4B) enzyme that specifically degrades cAMP causing reduced PKA-dependent phosphorylation and
opening of CFTR ion channels. Moreover, we demonstrate that roflumilast, a clinically used PDE4 inhibitor, is
successful in restoring cAMP levels in alcohol-treated cells and reversing CFTR dysfunction and mucus
abnormalities in alcohol-treated rats.
Guided by these strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three Specific Aims to investigate how
alcohol-induced CFTR dysfunction may cause susceptibility to bacteria pneumonia: (1) Determine the specific
contribution of reduced CFTR function to alcohol-induced defects in mucociliary clearance. (2) Determine the
molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced CFTR dysfunction. (3) Determine the clinical benefits of
reversing alcohol-induced CFTR dysfunction towards preventing bacterial pneumonia.
Collectively, our proposed research will broadly impact the field by characterizing the essential role of
CFTR dysfunction in compromising lung defense in alcohol users. These studies will have the potential to
uncover novel molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial pneumonia as well as advance new treatment
approaches to reduce disease burden. These findings may be extrapolated to other non-pulmonary alcohol
use disorders such as pancreatitis, diabetes and infertility, where there are similar therapeutic needs and
knowledge gaps regarding the pathogenic role of CFTR dysfunction."
10757689,"Discovery of novel mechanisms that impact CFTR translation and contribute to cystic fibrosis
pathogenesis
Abstract
This project is intended to advance high throughput yeast phenomics technology and provide new mechanistic
information regarding a model genetic disease, cystic fibrosis (CF). When clinically significant mutations in the
CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) are engineered in a yeast homolog (YOR1), genome-wide
phenomic analysis using the yeast deletion strain library (YDSL) identifies novel pathways that impact CF
molecular phenotype. New experimental targets for CF therapy also result from studies of this type. Under
Specific Aim 1 of the renewal, we show ways in which genome-wide yeast studies can advance understanding
of CFTR variants including nonsense (Type 1) and severe folding (Type 2) defects for which no “personalized”
modulator treatment currently exists. We also demonstrate phenomics can be applied to elucidate pathways
necessary for pharmacologic rescue. Specific Aim 2 engages leading-edge technology (ribosomal profiling,
deep-sequencing based on modification mapping (Psi-Seq)) to delve deeply into novel (and unexpected)
mediators of CFTR biogenesis based on analysis of mammalian translational efficiency. In particular, we
examine the role of ribosomal “collisions” or “queueing” described by phenomic analysis, and mRNA
pseudouridinylation for effects on CFTR translation and protein synthesis. Specific Aim 3, applies innovative
CF cell models to establish clinical significance of findings from Aims 1 and 2. The proposed studies will test
important hypotheses relevant to CF pathogenesis, provide new knowledge regarding translational velocity and
mRNA utilization during CFTR expression, and show that ribosomal collisions and pseudouridinylation
contribute to cystic fibrosis. Our findings will also help advance new targets for treating refractory forms of CF.
Lessons learned from the studies can be applied to many other inherited and serious human illnesses."

why specific learning disabilities (SLDs) co-occur so often with other SLDs and with other
disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and anxiety. Three samples
will be enrolled to accomplish the specific aims of Project I over the next five years. Project I and
II will work together to collect a total sample of 600 consecutive referrals through our
assessment clinics, including approximately 200 children from lower income families and
significant subgroups with severe SLDs and multiple comorbidities. In addition to the clinic
sample, Project I and Project II will also collaborate on a 5-year longitudinal follow-up study of
220 twins who participated in the CLDRC during the current funding period. Participants in both
of these studies will come to Project I laboratories to complete a comprehensive battery that
includes measures of basic and higher-order aspects of reading, math, and writing, nearly all
neuropsychological constructs that are included in the most prominent cognitive models of SLDs
and related psychopathology, and ratings of ADHD, SCT, anxiety, and other dimensions of
psychopathology and functional impairment. To complement these two studies of children with
SLDs, the third Project I sample will be a follow-up at age 30 of a sample that was first assessed
in preschool, facilitating analyses of the development of SLDs over 25 years. Results will
provide important new information regarding the structure of SLDs, the immediate and long-term
implications of comorbidity between different SLDs and other related disorders, and the shared
etiological influences and neuropsychological weaknesses that may lead to these comorbity."

10931534,"ABSTRACT – Pilot Project 5
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive human malignancies and the survival
rate remains stagnant with a 5-year survival rate of only 5-8%. Black/African Americans (B/AA) individuals
experience the highest prevalence and lowest overall survival rates of PDAC compared to their White
counterparts. FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) is often the preferred
chemotherapy treatment choice for patients with PDAC, but considerable toxicities have limited its use. The
decreased expression of nucleoside transporters due to genetic and epigenetic reasons appeared to account for
Gem resistance. In addition, deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), which is responsible for Gem phosphorylation into the
active form, is postulated to correlate with Gem efficacy. To address these challenges, we have modified Gem
to 4-(N)- stearoylGem (4NSG) to: i) block the CDA attack on Gem, and ii) increase Gem transport into PDAC
cells. Our recent results revealed highly expressed epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) in pancreatic
tumor samples. Guided by our recently published and unpublished results, we hypothesize that optimized 4NSG
nanoparticles with surface-modified anti-EGFR antibody (4NSGnpcetu) will improve the therapeutic efficacy of
Gem. We propose the following specific aims to address this hypothesis. Aim 1: Test the efficacy of 4NSGnpcetu,
in B/AA, and White patient-derived organoid models (PDOs) with stroma and in primary PDAC cells. Aim 2:
Evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of 4NSGnpcetu in PDAC PDX mouse models bearing subcutaneous tumors from
B/AA and White patients. Aim 3: Measure dCK RNA/protein expression in PDAC PDX tumor models and SNP
genotypes in PDAC cases and controls in the MultiEthnic dataset. Our studies will determine whether racial
differences in dCK variant, gene expression, and protein activity can correlate with improved Gem efficacy in
B/AA and /or White PDAC patients. The valuable information obtained will significantly advance the overall goal
of improving the response and survival rate in PDAC patients."

Suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) are substantially impacted by genetic factors. However, molecular
genetic studies of suicidality, and their genetically informative epidemiologic counterparts, have historically
been statistically underpowered, precluding substantive interpretation of the effects of genetic influences in a
developmental or psychosocial context. Recent advances include well-powered genomewide association
studies alongside twin/family modeling of Swedish national registry data on (non-fatal) suicide attempt and
death. The clear signals observed in these studies provide initial insight to the genetic etiology of suicidality,
including: (i) suicide attempt and death are substantially, but not entirely, genetically correlated, raising the
possibility that genetic liability underlying these distinct outcomes may be differentially related to risk pathways;
(ii) the qualitative and quantitative nature of genetic liability to suicidality shifts across the life course; and (iii)
genetic influences underlying suicidality are likely related to multiple behavioral correlates of risk, notably
behavioral disinhibition and depression. Additional gene identification studies are essential to further elucidate
the molecular nature of suicidality. However, to fully characterize how genetic liability manifests into STB,
gene-finding studies must be complemented by research efforts that address the relationship between
aggregate genetic risk and distinct STB outcomes, STB occurring during different periods of development (e.g.,
adolescence versus adulthood), key behavioral mediators, and environmental precipitants. The current
proposal will address this critical knowledge gap through the incorporation of aggregate genetic risk scores for
suicide attempt or death into models of psychosocial risk for STB. We will implement our research aims in a
range of target samples selected for the unique perspectives they enable: (i) They span the life course, from
childhood to late adulthood (and through death in the case of national Swedish registries); (ii) several include
longitudinal assessments; (iii) they are densely phenotypically characterized, with data available on multiple
STB (e.g., ideation, plans, attempts), behavioral mediators, and environmental risk factors; and (iv) they
include five population-based studies, enabling us to expand our understanding of STB etiology outside of
highly selected samples, along with two samples ascertained for history of major depression, enabling us to
assess whether pathways of risk to STB are consistent across groups, and whether genetic liability to
suicidality is superseded by the powerful clinical context of depression. The assembled team’s complementary
areas of expertise are ideally suited to successfully implement the research aims. The proposed analyses
leverage the aforementioned recent advances in the genetics of suicidality while enabling unparalleled and
critical context for understanding the complex and dynamic pathways to suicidal thoughts and behaviors."
10762332,"PROJECT SUMMARY The aortic arch artery and its branches are blood vessels that route the oxygenated blood
from the heart to the systemic circulation. Defects in the development of the aortic arch artery lead to lethal forms
of congenital heart disease (CHD) due to interruption(s) in the systemic circulation, for example, the interrupted
aortic arch type B (IAA-B). These defects often occur in conjunction with 22q11 deletion syndrome, the most
common congenital chromosomal abnormality syndrome in humans. Therefore, understanding genes and
mechanisms regulating the development of the aortic arch artery will provide valuable insights into CHD etiology
and potential treatments. Aortic arch artery and its branches form following the remodeling of the symmetrical
pharyngeal arch arteries (PAAs) into the asymmetrical vascular tree. We demonstrated that the PAA endothelium
is mainly derived from progenitors in the second heart field (SHF). Furthermore, we found that genetic mutations
resulting in the deficiency in the SHF-derived endothelium cause IAA-B. This grant application describes two
new mouse models in which an unexpected source of endothelial progenitors repairs the deficiency in the SHF-
derived endothelial cells (ECs) and rescues aortic arch artery formation. Our discovery of an alternative
endothelial source that repairs PAA defects has opened the possibility to determine mechanisms regulating this
compensatory repair process. We also discovered that the compensatory endothelium is not recruited in the
Tbx1+/- mouse model of 22q11 deletion syndrome, resulting in IAA-B and neonatal lethality in ~65% of Tbx1+/-
mice. In this grant application, we propose to determine the source of compensating ECs, mechanisms regulating
the recruitment of compensatory endothelium, and how Tbx1 regulates this process. To accomplish these goals,
we propose the following Specific Aims: 1 To test the hypothesis that the compensating endothelium is derived
from a vein, and 2 To determine signals regulating the recruitment of the compensatory ECs to rescue arch
artery formation. In this proposal, we will use novel mouse strains, genetic engineering, quantitative 3D confocal
imaging, in situ hybridization, and RNAseq to uncover candidate genes regulating the compensatory response.
Upon completing the proposed work, we will uncover innate mechanisms of compensation and robustness,
whereby a newborn's viability is ensured through alternative mechanisms. Harnessing these mechanisms would
provide new opportunities for treatments of CHD in the future."

Conventional mechanistic research and drug development relies heavily on in vivo animal models and in vitro
cell culture systems. Although conventional in vitro cultured 2D or 3D cells enable the analysis of signaling
pathways and the identification of signature genes associated with responses of infection or various conditions
and treatments, they can't reproduce complex cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions occurring in the tissue
microenvironment. Animal models provide understanding on in vivo integrated multi-organ responses but
serious concerns exist over their predictive value and biological relevance to humans. In fact, more and more
drug candidates have failed to advance from Phase I to Phase III clinical trials and to reach the market. Critical
challenges to reduce costly failures in clinical trials highlight the urgency to generate better model systems for
preclinical testing of drug efficacy and safety in humans, and for understanding molecular mechanisms
underlying thousands of human diseases. A three-dimensional (3D) human tissue model promises compelling
advantages to predict complex physiological functions, immune responses to infectious diseases, and
pharmacological responses to therapeutic agents. Such a synthetic tissue model has outstanding potential for
reliable drug efficacy testing and as a superior replacement for an animal model, especially for those infectious
diseases that do not have adequate animal models. Skin is the largest organ of the human body and forms a
barrier to protect the body against pathogens and penetration of potential harmful substances. In order to
mimic the organ-level skin pathophysiology in humans, we propose to harness bioengineering approaches to
develop an in vitro 3D `skin-on-chip' that incorporates circulating immune cells into the normal architecture of
skin epidermis and dermis for modeling of viral-host interactions in human herpes simplex virus (HSV)
infection. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Establish and validate a vascularized 3D `skin-on-chip' platform using
donor-derived primary cells for modeling of HSV infection and identifying key immune responses for protection.
2) Recapitulate a tissue resident memory T-cell compartment in 3D vascularized `skin-on-chip' for modeling of
antigenic specificity, cell density and TCR diversity in tissue resident memory T-cell mediated local immune

Protein synthesis is an essential process in all living organisms catalyzed by the ribosome – one of the largest
and the most complex macromolecular machines created by nature. Our group uses structural, biochemical, and
microbiological techniques to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of ribosome functioning in bacteria,
the modes of action of ribosome-targeting antibiotics, and mechanisms of drug resistance. Interaction of the
growing polypeptide chain with the nascent peptide exit tunnel (NPET) in the large ribosomal subunit during
protein synthesis plays a fundamental role in the regulation of gene expression as well as in co-translational
protein folding. Despite the extreme chemical diversity of its substrates and products, ribosome efficiently makes
all cellular proteins. However, some of the peptide sequences were evolutionarily selected to be problematic for
the ribosome resulting in translation arrest during their synthesis. The cell often uses this phenomenon of peptide
sequence-specific translation arrest, which can occur in a ligand-dependent manner turning the ribosome into a
small-molecule sensor, to control its metabolism. Currently, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how
interactions of the arrest peptides with NPET and small molecules or antibiotics result in the arrest of translation.
This knowledge gap could be addressed by structural studies capturing both arrested and non-arrested
Ribosome Nascent chain Complexes (RNCs) containing relevant peptides in the NPET. While many cryo-EM
structures of ribosomes carrying various stalling peptides became available in the past years, they all represent
arrested RNCs. Because the experimental approach used in these studies for the preparation of RNCs relies on
the ability of the ribosome to stall in the presence of a small molecule and a wild-type arrest peptide, using the
same methods for the preparation of respective non-arrested RNCs is impossible. Alternatively, the desired
arrested or non-arrested RNCs could be assembled from the individually purified components. However, this
strategy has remained challenging due to the lack of a reliable method for the large-scale preparation of peptidyl-
tRNAs. Recently, we have developed a chemoenzymatic approach based on native chemical ligation reaction
for facile semi-synthesis of peptidyl-tRNAs. Most importantly, by determining the first high-resolution structures
of non-arrested RNCs, we found that synthetic peptidyl-tRNAs can be efficiently complexed to the ribosome in
vitro and yet represent a functionally significant state of the ribosome’s catalytic site. Therefore, our group is best
suited to bridge the existing knowledge gap in our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying antibiotic-
or sequence-dependent ribosome stalling by determining high-resolution structures of model RNCs under
arresting or non-arresting conditions. Altogether, the proposed project will uncover enigmatic mechanisms of
sequence-dependent nascent chain-mediated ribosome stalling, provide the structural basis for the context-
specific action of several chemically unrelated classes of ribosomal antibiotics, and reveal mechanisms of action
of ABCF ribosome protection proteins upon stalled ribosomes."

The number of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains at an all-time high and is predicted to
increase over the next decade. Therefore, it is of significant medical interest to define the underlying mechanisms
driving T2DM to improve therapeutic efficacy. Insulin resistance, a condition known as reduced effectiveness to
the hormone insulin, is associated with altered glucose homeostasis and muscle dysfunction. Despite decades
of investigation, critical knowledge gaps remain in the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the
initiation and propagation of insulin resistance. The skeletal muscle plays a significant role in glucose
homeostasis and accounts for a majority of glucose disposal following a meal. Defects in the insulin signaling
pathway in the skeletal muscle have been hypothesized to be the primary cause of insulin resistance leading to
hyperglycemia, altered protein metabolism and cardiovascular disease. Accumulating evidence has implicated
the serine/threonine kinase Akt (protein kinase B) as a critical regulator of insulin action. To directly test the
hypothesis that reduced insulin signaling via AKT causes insulin resistance and alters muscle function, we
generated mice that lack AKT signaling specifically in skeletal muscle and surprisingly found that insulin can
stimulate skeletal muscle glucose uptake and utilization in the absence of AKT. These data are inconsistent with
the canonical molecular model of insulin resistance and suggest AKT is not an obligate intermediate in the control
of skeletal muscle glucose metabolism by insulin in all conditions. The identification of this AKT-independent
pathway and its role carbohydrate homeostasis will be the focus of Aim 1 of this proposal. Although mice lacking
AKT in skeletal muscle have normal glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity, we found that they nevertheless
exhibit significant muscle atrophy and mitochondrial dysfunction with a corresponding defect in muscle
performance, confirming that AKT is required for muscle growth and function in vivo. The downstream
mechanisms responsible for AKT’s control of muscle growth and function will be defined in Aim 2. Collectively,
this proposal will build upon these important observations and elucidate the Akt-dependent and independent
pathways that control the metabolic actions of insulin in vivo. These experiments have the potential to profoundly
affect our mechanistic understanding of the pathways underlying insulin resistance and will lead to the
identification of new therapeutic targets for T2DM, cardiovascular and skeletomuscular diseases."

My lab has focused on developing methods to understand the causes and consequences of biological
heterogeneity. Examples of heterogeneity include differences between the traits of individuals in a population,
between cells in an organism or between proteins in a cell. Heterogeneity defines the phenotypic landscape at
the organismal, cellular and molecular levels, shaping how biological systems respond to short-term
perturbations and how species and tumors evolve. Heterogeneity can be encoded by genetic variants or it can
arise from environmental perturbations or stochastically.
My lab’s past successes include a plethora of new approaches to understand phenotypic heterogeneity arising
from genetic variation. In particular, I developed deep mutational scanning, which can measure the
consequences of tens or hundreds of thousands of genetic variants on different aspects of protein or cell
function. Using deep mutational scanning, my lab has gained fundamental insights into protein structure and
function, enhanced computational variant effect prediction and reshaped how human genetic variants are
interpreted. Moreover, hundreds of labs around the world have taken up my methods and, collectively, the
methods have been used to measure the effects of millions of genetic variants in hundreds of genes.
Now, I am investigating the causes and consequences of non-genetic biological heterogeneity. For example, I
am fascinated by questions like “how do isogenic cells in a population, each with a different transcriptomic,
proteomic and metabolomic state, respond differently to a perturbation? How does the initial state of a cell
determine its eventual fate? What, if anything, does cellular morphologic heterogeneity mean either in terms of
cell state or fate?” However, answering these questions requires developing new methods. Thus, in this MIRA
application, I am seeking funding to extend my work probing the basic biology of non-genetic cellular
heterogeneity by developing a slate of new methods and using them to answer fundamental questions like
those highlighted above."

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It
represents a significant public health burden striking 1.7 million American annually (with 20-25% mortality). In
general, early stages of sepsis are characterized by a potentially detrimental hyperinflammatory state.
However, patients who survive the cytokine storm phase of sepsis enter a state of immunoparalysis defined by
enhanced susceptibility to infection, viral reactivation, and mortality years after the septic insult. Sepsis-induced
lymphopenia reduces the number of immune cells and influences the function of remaining/surviving cells.
Yet, the sepsis-induced lymphopenia is transient while the prolonged immunoparalysis (or
immunosuppression) that develops (even after lymphocyte numbers normalize) is now considered a leading
reason for the extended period of increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral pathogens normally handled by
the immune system in healthy individuals. Therefore, our long-term goal is to precisely determine, on cellular
and molecular levels, sepsis-induced changes in various lymphocyte populations that support and define the
chronic state of immunoparalysis and inability of immune cells to exert their effector functions properly. We
identified four interconnected areas of research that we will pursue: a) Explore molecular mechanisms that
govern long-term maintenance and function of infection-or vaccine-induced protective memory CD8 T cell
responses after sepsis; b) Define the cellular basis of increased susceptibility to tumor development and
decreased ability to evoke autoimmune responses in sepsis survivors; c) Develop new experimental models of
sepsis research; d) Investigate the interplay between clinical (human) and experimental (mouse) research to
elucidate mechanisms and pathways that control sepsis-induced immunoparalysis state. Addressing these key
gaps in our understanding of sepsis-induced immunoparalysis will ultimately uncover new targets that can be
used to develop better and more efficient treatments of sepsis survivors."
10765740,"Cancer chemotherapy causes marked cognitive impairment that involves deficits in learning & memory,
attention, and executive functions. The best characterized genetic risk factor for chemotherapy induced
cognitive impairment (CICI) is the E4 allele of APOE, which is also the strongest genetic risk factor for
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This commonality of risk provides a powerful opportunity to define mechanisms of
the effects of APOE4 on cognitive dysfunction across conditions. We have developed a mouse model of
APOE4-related CICI showing strong chemotherapy-induced cognitive effects in the APOE4 mice but not
APOE3 mice, providing independent confirmation of this genetic risk in humans. We hypothesize that
chemotherapy induces CNS damages related to APOE functions. We are testing specific mechanisms of
APOE4-related vulnerability in four specific aims: Aim 1: Determine how chemotherapy affects pathogenic
processes of Alzheimer’s disease. We will use a mouse model of amyloid influenced by the different APOE
alleles (EFAD mice), to define mechanisms of chemotherapy on AD pathogenesis. We will expose cohorts of
E3FAD and E4FAD mice to a chemotherapy regimen or vehicle control, and determine which AD pathological
pathways are affected (A levels, phospho-tau, microglial and astrocytic activation, neuronal and synaptic loss,
and hippocampal atrophy). Aim 2: Define mechanisms of APOE4-related chemotherapy sensitivity in a
non-AD model. The APOE4 knock-in mouse model allows testing for CNS alterations that may underlie CICI
in cognitively healthy individuals. We will test CNS mechanisms already identified in relation to the APOE4
genotype for exacerbation after chemotherapy, including: inflammation; neurogenesis; DNA damage; glial
senescence; blood brain barrier breakdown; and oxidative damage. Aim 3: Identify specific chemotherapies
associated with lower risks of cognitive impairment. We will use our sensitive and reproducible APOE4
mouse model to test whether some cancer chemotherapeutic approaches are safer than others. We will treat
the susceptible APOE4 mice with four of the common cancer chemotherapies with different mechanisms of
action. Aim 4: Test therapeutic approaches to prevention of chemotherapy-induced cognitive
impairments. Identification of APOE-related mechanisms allows the targeted identification of preventative
approaches. We initially will test an agent for increasing lipidated APOE levels (bexarotene), and an anti-
inflammatory agent (an antagonist of the receptor for advance glycation endproducts (RAGE)). Together, these
Aims will identify mechanisms underlying the risk of CICI in the large portion of the population carrying the
APOE4 allele. In addition, the acute nature for the onset of CICI allows a more controlled approach for studying
the negative effects of APOE4 in vivo, compared to only studying gradual processes of aging and
neurodegeneration. Findings can be easily translated to clinical situations in terms of identifying at risk
individuals and in terms of identifying new APOE4-related biomarkers of cognitive impairment."

 The major goal of this proposal is to address the dynamic role of TREM2-mediated microglial function in
brain aging and during different stages of the pathological development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). TREM2 is
a microglial specific gene with several of its rare variants associated with AD risk. Despite some progress, the
molecular pathobiology of TREM2 in particular the TREM2-R47H risk variant is still not clear. Studies
examining the effects of loss of TREM2 function in mouse models support inconsistent conclusions; with
TREM2 deficiency either reduces or enhances amyloid or tau pathology and associated toxicity depending on
the stage of the pathological development or the specific mouse models. As such, TREM2-mediated microglial
function likely has dynamic effects on amyloid and tau pathologies depending on pathological stages
throughout AD progression. Further complicating the challenge of studying the impact of TREM2-R47H variant,
a recent study revealed that introducing the R47H mutation into the mouse Trem2 gene locus leads to aberrant
splicing and instability of its mRNA. To fill these gaps in knowledge and the lack of appropriate model systems,
we have generated novel cell type-specific and inducible mouse models expressing human TREM2 or TREM2-
R47H in microglia. To address human relevance and molecular mechanisms, we have also generated human
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines carrying TREM2 or TREM2-R47H. Thus, the major goal of this
proposal is to examine the dynamic effects of human TREM2 and TREM2-R47H on microglial and neuronal
functions in aging and AD; while in the process defines the underlying molecular pathways by targeted and
non-targeted approaches. We hypothesize that TREM2-mediated microglial function is protective against the
development of AD pathologies but can be detrimental when such pathologies are associated with synaptic
loss and neurodegeneration. We also hypothesize that TREM2-R47H represents a loss-of-function in particular
in microglia-mediated protection against AD-related pathways. We will test our hypothesis through three aims.
In Aim 1, we plan to analyze the effects of TREM2 or TREM2-R47H upon injury paradigms and during aging in
the absence of AD pathology. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of TREM2 or TREM2-R47H on the
metabolism, deposition, and toxicity of Aβ and tau at different stages of pathological development. In Aim 3, we
plan to identify and validate the molecular pathways associated with TREM2 and TREM2-R47H using iPSC-
derived microglia-like cells with or without integration into cerebral organoids. This innovative proposal will take
advantage of our existing conditional mouse models and iPSC-derived cellular models combined with state-of-
the-art technologies including in vivo microdialysis, two-photon microscopy and molecular profiling by single
cell RNA-Seq. These efforts should collectively help to understand how TREM2 modulates microglial dynamic
roles in aging and AD pathogenesis and how we can target these pathways to treat AD."

 Pancreatitis is a potentially fatal disease of exocrine pancreas, with obscure pathogenesis and no specific or
efficient treatment available. Excessive/unresolving inflammation is a major determinant of pancreatitis severity
but its mechanisms are poorly understood. Recent findings in experimental and genetic models have uncovered
key pathogenic roles of impaired autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in acinar cell damage driving
pancreatitis; disordering of these pathways is also prominent in human disease. Blockade/impairment of
pancreatic autophagy initiates inflammation in genetic models, such as pancreas-specific knockout of the key
autophagy mediator ATG5. Conversely, enhancing autophagic efficiency (or normalizing mitochondrial function)
ameliorates the inflammatory response in experimental pancreatitis. These findings strongly indicate that normal
autophagy restricts inflammation in pancreatitis; however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown.
 We hypothesize that a key mechanism linking impaired autophagy to inflammation in pancreatitis is acinar
cell mitochondrial dysfunction; and further, that this mechanism is mediated by the increase in acinar cell
mitochondrial (mt)ROS and mtDNA release. We posit that these effectors activate major proinflammatory
pathways: NF-κB, triggering the expression of cytokines/chemokines in acinar cells and thus initiating the
inflammatory response; the DNA-sensing cGAS-STING-TBK1 pathway in macrophages, resulting in production
of type I IFNs; and inflammasome activation in macrophages, resulting in massive production of IL-1β and IL-
18. The proposed studies will use genetic and pharmacologic approaches to elucidate the roles of these
pathways. The hypothesis will be tested in 3 Specific Aims:
 1). Determine the effects of impaired autophagy on mitochondrial dysfunction and pancreatic inflammation
in genetic and experimental models of pancreatitis.
 2). Investigate macrophage cGAS-STING-TBK1 pathway activation caused by impaired autophagy in
genetic and experimental models of pancreatitis.
 3). Investigate the role of (canonical) inflammasome pathway in macrophage activation caused by impaired
autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction.
 Our proposed studies will determine the mechanisms linking impaired autophagy and mitochondrial
dysfunction to macrophage-driven inflammatory response of pancreatitis. The studies will identify molecular
targets in these pathways that could be amenable for pharmacologic intervention to alleviate the inflammatory
response of pancreatitis."

Skeletal muscle stem cell (MuSC) transplantation is emerging as a promising strategy for treating muscle-

potential in conventional 2D culture, critically limiting their applicability for cell-based therapy. This inability to
culture MuSCs further limits the employment of cell engineering strategies, such as ex vivo gene editing patient
derived cells. Thus, there is a critical need for a strategy to maintain and expand therapeutically potent MuSC
ex vivo long-term. To date, MuSC culture systems that recapitulate the asymmetric MuSC niche, consisting of
myofiber and basal lamina, required to establish cellular polarity, support physiologic cell division, and guide
fate specification, do not exist. The contribution of active mechanical forces in modulating MuSC polarity,
division, and fate specification also remains overlooked. We believe that establishing MuSC polarity is a
requirement for supporting long-term symmetric expansion ex vivo through biochemical and biophysical means.
To this end, the proposed research will engineer an asymmetric designer platform for expanding self-renewing
MuSCs ex vivo long-term by directing cellular polarity and fate specification. In Aim 1, we will identify minimally
essential asymmetric cues for establishing MuSC polarity by engineering an asymmetric hydrogel. In Aim 2, we
will determine the effects of biochemically promoting symmetric cell division on long-term expansion of MuSCs
using the asymmetric hydrogel. Biochemical strategies to inhibit asymmetric division and to promote symmetric
division to achieve ex vivo MuSC expansion will be tested. In Aim 3, we will determine the effects of dynamic
biomechanical stretch on regulation of symmetric MuSC expansion using the asymmetric hydrogel.
Mechanisms by which externally applied forces align mitotic spindle orientation and regulate cell division of
polarized MuSCs will be tested. Successful outcomes of this research will not only develop a platform for
expanding MuSCs for cell therapies by directing stem cell polarity and fate specification but also provide
establish a new paradigm for harnessing stem cell polarity in cell-instructive biomaterials for regenerative

division to achieve ex vivo MuSC expansion will be tested. In Aim 3, we will determine the effects of dynamic
biomechanical stretch on regulation of symmetric MuSC expansion using the asymmetric hydrogel.
Mechanisms by which externally applied forces align mitotic spindle orientation and regulate cell division of
polarized MuSCs will be tested. Successful outcomes of this research will not only develop a platform for
expanding MuSCs for cell therapies by directing stem cell polarity and fate specification but also provide
establish a new paradigm for harnessing stem cell polarity in cell-instructive biomaterials for regenerative

Dissemination and implementation (D&I) science is the study of how to effectively translate research findings
into practice and policy. By integrating dissemination and implementation science into the clinical and
translational science spectrum, researchers and practitioners can better understand the factors that influence
the uptake of evidence-based practices and develop strategies to overcome barriers to implementation.
However, in the Deep South, there is a critical shortage of professionals broadly . This limits the ability of
researchers and practitioners to develop and implement effective interventions to address health disparities
and improve health equity. Hence the objective of this proposed program is to launch the first T32 postdoctoral
training program dedicated to the integration of dissemination and implementation science within and across
the translational science spectrum. We seek applications from MDs, PhDs, and doctoral candidates, from a
wide range of clinical and scientific disciplines, and diverse personal backgrounds. The proposed program will
take full advantage of the stellar resources of the Clinical and Translational Science Center at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham and related Deep South Partner Network. The program’s aims are to: [1] Identify,
recruit, and train a diverse cadre of postdoctoral scientists with the knowledge, skills, and experience
to become independent investigators who will continue to expand the field of dissemination and
implementation; [2] Establish a rigorous, innovative training program in dissemination and
implementation science to facilitate nuanced integration of D&I domains within and across the
translational science spectrum; [3] Enhance the integration of D&I and clinical and translational
science by embracing health equity as a critical, key focus area of scientific advancement. This
proposal has 4 distinguishing characteristics: (1) Integration with an NCATS-supported Clinical and
Translational Science Hub at UAB and Partner Network comprised of 11 institutions across the Deep South of
the US; (2) D&I mentors and resources representing an extraordinary breadth of disciplines across the
translational spectrum; (3) A focus on D&I research centered in addressing health inequities in the Deep
South, and (4) An training design anchored in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. Didactic
components leverage coursework developed by UAB and Partner Network investigators, and additional UAB
programs that have trained generations of scientists in clinical investigation, translational science, and public
health research methods. Training duration will be 2 years. We will have 5 slots per year. Successful
candidates must show evidence of a strong commitment to D&I science a commitment to health equity
research. Trainee progress will be monitored and evaluated by the Program Directors, mentors, and advisory
committees."

Title: New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits
One of the biggest challenges in biology is to elucidate complex gene interactions and networks for the purpose
of developing interventions in human disease. Particularly important are those gene networks that control cellular
state transitions (e.g., replicative to quiescent, epithelial to mesenchymal, etc.). Thanks to the emergence of
next-generation sequencing technology, rich data resources are available for mapping gene regulatory
interactions. However, the field still lacks a systems-level understanding of how genes in a network collectively
perform their functions and control cellular state transitions, information that is critical for informed clinical
intervention. The PI’s long-term goal is to design effective computer-aided strategies for predicting therapeutic
interventions by integrating knowledge of gene regulatory networks, genomics data from patients, and systems-
biology model simulations. So far, numerous computational methods have been developed to infer and model
gene regulatory networks. However, they typically suffer from the following issues. First, current approaches are
still ineffective to choose an appropriate set of genes and regulatory interactions in a network to model. Current
approaches infer regulatory relationships based on association of gene expression signals, but generally don't
also consider whether an inferred gene regulatory network can operate as a functional dynamical system driving
expected transitions between the network states. Second, traditional mathematical modeling is hard to be applied
systematically to large systems, because many kinetic parameters are unmeasurable directly from experiments,
especially in vivo. The parameter uncertainty and the potential risk of overfitting in large systems have limited
the predictive power of systems biology. To address these issues, the PI’s research program will develop a suite
of computational systems biology algorithms to construct and model high-quality core regulatory circuits driving
cellular state transitions. We have recently developed enhanced ensemble-based mathematical modeling
algorithms for simulating network behaviors without the need of detailed kinetic parameters. This advance has
allowed an integrated top-down and bottom-up systems-biology modeling, as evident from the PI’s recently
developed network reconstruction and modeling method NetAct and network coarse-graining algorithm
SacoGraci. The PI’s research program will further advance novel technologies of ensemble-based modeling and
their applications to optimize high-quality systems-biology models that capture cellular state transitions. The
algorithms will be benchmarked and refined using in-silico simulated data, publicly available omics data sets,
and data from collaborations, with a focus on cell differentiation in developmental processes and state transitions
in oncogenesis. Success of the research program will result in a comprehensive toolkit that will unveil the gene
regulatory mechanism of cellular state transitions. The algorithmic development is expected to have a broad
impact on not only basic research in systems biology but also shed light on therapeutic intervention in genomic
medicine."

The Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) plays a critical role in achieving the Center objectives by
serving as a central repository of Center data and providing for cross-indexing and linkage of the diverse data
sets produced by the environmental and biomedical projects and cores in the Center. The current PROTECT
Database System holds nearly 7 million cleaned and secure data entities. The DMAC is responsible for the
reliability of the data, including cleaning, replication and backup, as well as the protection of the data, including
de-identification of human subjects, and secure and authenticated access. The DMAC allows data generated
by the projects to be cross-indexed by all projects based on a global PROTECT Data Dictionary that includes
common index fields (subject ID, GIS coordinates) to foster sharing and integration. DMAC also provides a rich
set of modeling and statistical analysis toolsets and expertise to support Project-level objectives. The
combined collection of data and tools allows PROTECT to work seamlessly across project domains and
effectively ties environmental factors to human subject outcomes.
To support Center goals and ensure its long-term impact, we will continue to build upon the rich infrastructure
developed in the first eight years of this Center. We will continue to partner with EarthSoft, a major provider of
environmental data management software, to provide enhanced database capabilities appropriate for all
Center projects and cores. We will continue to support cleaning, indexing, documenting, and security of all
Center-based data through a secure, online, database system, as well as provide a common suite of advanced
statistical/analysis tools integrated into the backend of the database system. As part of the renewal, we will
expand our analytics support by adding Jennifer Dy, Justin Manjourides and Bhramar Mukherjee to the DMAC,
supporting machine learning and statistical analysis of mixtures that include phthalates, chlorinated volatile
organic compounds (CVOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), metals and pesticides across all
projects. We will expand our use of mapping with a Geographic Information System (GIS), integrating analytics
and mapping into a common framework, making our data easily understood by a wide range of communities.
To achieve our Center-level aims that tie environmental factors to health-related outcomes, the DMAC will
continue to develop a common suite of analysis and visualization tools based on GIS, SAS, R and Python,
providing analysis tailored for each project, while also leveraging state-of-the-art software and frameworks. The
specific statistical tools developed for mixtures analysis will use RStudio’s data cleaning, visualization and
archiving functions, and will be disseminated through GitHub. The DMAC already has developed a suite of
Data Mining tools that provide regression and clustering analysis in an integrated online visualization
framework. Finally, we will work closely with the Community Engagement Core and the Training cores to
provide education on data analysis, and to support data reporting and communication of results."

Since its inception in 2010, the PROTECT Research Experience and Training Coordination Core (RETCC – 
formerly the Training Core) has prepared our trainees for successful careers in the environmental health fields, 
with results evident in our trainees’ impressive follow-on positions in industry, government labs and agencies, 
and academia. We provide innovative learning opportunities that emphasize multidisciplinary and team-based 
approaches, the application of leadership, communication, and community-based methodologies, and other 
professional skills. The specific aims (objectives) of the RETCC are to: 1) provide high quality transdisciplinary 
training, education, professional development and mentoring experiences to diverse trainees at the institutions 
participating in the PROTECT program; 2) collaborate and share best practices with other SRP centers to 
jointly develop and deliver professional development, training and networking opportunities for trainees across 
multiple SRP centers; 3) facilitate trainee interactions with the Community Engagement Core, the Human 
Subjects and Sampling Core, and the research translation component of the Administrative Core to promote 
trainee engagement with cultures and communities connected to our collaborating institutions to provide place- 
based, experiential environmental health and justice education; and 4) provide ongoing interaction with the 
Data Management and Analysis Core, through various training modalities and mentorship, on the use of data 
analytics as a research tool and the importance of well-designed and implemented data management as an 
environmental health practice. The rationale for the Core’s approach is that environmental health 
professionals must have disciplinary depth, and also knowledgably consider the breadth of collaborating 
disciplines. The RETCC uses a logic model in its design that identifies the resources required to implement 
the program, planned activities and outputs, and outcomes that are expected over time. The model is refined 
through a regular evaluation program. Key activities are planned to create tailored training experiences in 4 
areas: 1) recruitment/orientation, 2) education and training, 3) community building, networking, and mentoring, 
and 4) professional development. Sample activities include Individual Development Plans and completion 
awards; technical and professional development webinars; PROTECT research-related coursework; in-person 
trainee programs at Northeast and SRP annual meetings; participation in SRP SPAN; support for fellowships 
and award applications; and, community-based initiatives related to environmental health and social justice. 
The RETCC involves 35 to 40 trainees per year across a wide spectrum of experience, discipline and 
educational levels. Our trainee levels are mostly MS and PhD students, and post-doctoral researchers, 
working in disciplines that include environmental engineering, geology, epidemiology and biostatistics, 
sociology, public health, toxicology, and data science. Our trainees are engaged in RETCC activities with a 
typical duration of 3 years, allowing for continuity and progression in their level of training."

Established in 2010, the Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) Superfund
Research Center (SRC) uses a holistic system of research, training and stakeholder engagement to study the
fate, transport, exposure, health impact and remediation of contaminant mixtures, aimed at reducing preterm
birth (PTB) and other adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs). Rates of PTB and infant mortality in Puerto Rico
(PR) are among the highest among all U.S. states and territories. After reaching 20% in 2008, the PTB rate in
PR has decreased to 11.4% in 2017, yet continues to be among the highest globally Evidence exists that
exposure to Superfund chemicals contributes to APOs. Contamination is extensive in PR: there are 18
Superfund sites, and evidence of contamination of the drinking water is extensive. There are also extreme
events (hurricanes, flooding) that may result in elevated exposures to environmental pollution. The Community
Engagement Core (CEC), working closely with the Human Subjects and Sampling Core (HSSC), the Research
Translation Coordinator, and the research projects, is the main vehicle for interaction with community
stakeholders in PR. PROTECT’s approach emphasizes bidirectional engagement with two groups of
stakeholders: 1) women participating in the PROTECT study cohort (1,457 participants with 1280 completed
pregnancies as of October 2018 with the goal of adding another 1000); and 2) the broader group of residents
in the areas where PROTECT’s groundwater study is being conducted, including collaborators at the
Community Health Centers (CHCs) and clinics that serve as study sites. The CEC’s continual connection with
the HSSC has produced strong relationships with study participants, staff and clinicians at CHCs and private
clinics, health educators, social work and nursing staff, and community groups. Building on this foundation, the
CEC will continue its strong bidirectional communication strategy, which includes meetings and focus groups
with participants and clinical staff, distribution of extensive educational materials on reproductive and child
health, and report-back of research findings to stakeholders, informed by stakeholder priorities, needs, and
concerns. Inspired by participant feedback, we will continue to implement a new interactive cell phone-based
app that allows individualized report-back to participants. This innovation will: more fully include participants in
the research process, improve study recruitment/retention, provide individual exposure reduction information,
and lay the groundwork for community-based participatory research projects. We will work extensively on
exposure reduction by providing detailed suggested actions in the app, and by working with Project 4
(Remediation) to test project-developed water filters. The CEC’s central role in providing water filters and
emergency supplies post-hurricane has made PROTECT even more trusted, and we will continue to provide
emergency preparedness training/support. We will continue work on capacity-building for participants, health
care providers, and their organizations, as well as develop resources for maternal and child health."
10767255,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Preterm birth – delivery at less than 37 weeks gestation – is a significant global public health challenge, and
preterm rates in the United States are considerably higher than they were several decades ago. Explanations
for these increases remain elusive, and environmental risk factors are an understudied but potentially
important area for discovery of modifiable risk factors and high-impact interventions. Compared to the United
States overall, significantly higher rates of preterm birth exist in Puerto Rico, where nearly 12% of all births are
preterm. Rates of other adverse pregnancy outcomes are also much higher in Puerto Rico than in the US, and
Puerto Rico has a large number of Superfund and other hazardous waste sites, and additional factors that may
result in elevated exposures to environmental pollution, such as hurricanes, flooding, and other events. This
project proposes to continue our prospective cohort study of novel risk factors for preterm birth and other
adverse pregnancy outcomes, with a focus on exposure to mixtures of Superfund-relevant chemicals. We
propose to expand our cohort to include 2,000 live births in northern Puerto Rico with detailed information and
samples collected at multiple times during pregnancy. We will then utilize state-of-the-art methods to estimate
biomarkers of exposure to chemical mixtures, in addition to intermediate biomarkers of effect in order to
provide much needed human data on environmental and other predictors of pregnancy outcomes in Puerto
Rico, and insights on the biological pathways involved. Results from our study thus far suggest that oxidative
stress may be an important link between exposure and outcome that needs to be explored in more depth. The
study aims to develop and incorporate innovative statistical techniques for mixtures and mediation, and identify
conditions and activities contributing to high exposures that can inform effective exposure reduction strategies.
Our specific aims are to: 1) Investigate exposure to a range of Superfund-relevant chemicals (phthalates,
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs], and metals, both as individual chemicals and as mixtures) and
adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth, impaired fetal growth (using data from repeat ultrasound
scans), birth weight, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes; 2) Determine demographic, geographic,
behavioral, weather, and other factors associated with higher exposure biomarker concentrations, both for
individual chemicals and multiple chemicals concurrently to inform exposure and risk reduction efforts; and 3)
Utilize state-of-the-art biomarkers and innovative statistical methods to discover oxidative stress pathways
involved in the relationships between chemical exposures and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The expected
outcomes of this study are new and much needed information on the magnitude, sources, and impacts of
exposure to Superfund-related chemicals, both individually and in combination, among pregnant women in this
high-risk population, and innovative methods for identifying relevant biological pathways and assessing health
impacts from exposure to mixtures. Our findings are likely to have a significant positive impact on public health."
10767261,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We propose to assess the effect of extreme weather, such as hurricanes, droughts, and intense storms, on
risks for exposure to contaminant mixtures in karst water systems. Karst systems are important sources of
freshwater for human consumption, but are highly susceptible to contamination from multiple sources. As a
result, karst groundwater poses a significant risk for exposure to contaminant mixtures and hence health
impacts. Flow in these systems may occur through fractures, conduits, and rock matrix. Because of their
unique characteristics, karst systems respond differently to extreme weather conditions than other aquifers.
Under storm conditions, high loads of contaminants and sediments enter the subsurface and are transported
rapidly and unattenuated through conduits to storage and exposure points. Under dry conditions, sediments
are immobile; contaminants are stored in sediments and the rock matrix, and are slowly released over long
periods of time, resulting in long-term exposure. Differences in loads, physicochemical properties, mobility, and
storage characteristics result in dynamic and heterogeneous distribution of contaminants in karst waters.
However, little is known about how extreme weather impacts the dynamic distribution and exposure of
contaminant mixtures in karst water and how they may affect health.
The proposed work will assess the effect of extreme weather on (1) groundwater hydraulic and geochemical
conditions, (2) sediment transport, deposition, and potential interactions with contaminants, and (3) distribution
of contaminant mixtures at points of potential exposure. Building on previous findings and existing
infrastructure, the project focuses on the karst region of northern Puerto Rico, which is the focal area of
PROTECT’s work to study the impact of exposure to multiple Superfund-related contaminants on adverse
pregnancy outcomes. The contaminants to be studied are phthalates, pesticides, chlorinated volatile organic
compounds, and metals because they are commonly found in Superfund sites in karst regions in Puerto Rico
and can adversely affect pregnancy outcomes. The proposed research will apply innovative data analytics
techniques to mine, visualize, and extract patterns and facts from data, and utilize those facts to make
inferences and build data-based models. The models will be used to describe and predict the effect of extreme
weather on the distribution of mixtures at groundwater and tap water potential points of exposure. This work
will also assess the role of karst sediments in the fate and transport of contaminants during extreme weather
conditions through novel analysis of depth-related properties in sediment deposits from karst caves.
Through an integrated multidisciplinary approach, this project will contribute to the development of (i)
innovative methods for assessing exposure risks to multiple, superfund-related hazardous substances
(Projects 1 & 3) and their association to adverse pregnancy outcomes (Projects 1 & 2); and (ii) optimized
technologies for reducing the amount and toxicity of contaminants in karst waters (Projects 2 & 4)."

Study Objectives: The goal of this project is to develop and test a portable, low-maintenance, and self-
cleaning water purification technology for both point-of-use and point-of-entry water treatment. A novel electro-
Fenton (EF)-like Electrochemical Advanced Oxidation Process (EAOP) will be coupled with sorption using
practical, cost-effective, environmentally friendly carbon-based porous cathodes. Two approaches will be
implemented: 1) removal of organic mixtures from the water via adsorption by carbon-based electrodes, then
regeneration of the adsorbent via application of the EAOP on the carbon-based porous cathode surfaces to
locally generate reactive oxygen species (ROS); and 2) simultaneous application of adsorption and EAOP. The
motivation for this work is the need to provide clean water to communities near Superfund sites in Puerto Rico
that lack access to clean water after the devastation of Hurricane Maria in 2017, as well as the need for a
water treatment technology that can be used in rural areas.
Study Approach: Laboratory studies will be conducted using water collected from the study area in Puerto
Rico. Target chemicals will include chlorinated solvents, phthalates, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs). Mechanistic studies will investigate continuous generation of ROS without addition of
traditional catalysts (Pd, Fe) that are expensive, waste-producing, or potentially toxic. Instead, we will use three
types of benign carbon-based cathodes: Granular Activated Carbon (GAC), Activated Carbon Fiber (ACF) and
Granular Biochar (GB). Enhancement techniques that include polarity reversal and floating cathodes will be
tested, and conditions that maximize continuous generation of ROS will be identified. Sorption characteristics
of the three carbon-based cathodes will be measured, and EAOP’s ability to regenerate the sorption capacity
of the cathodes and simultaneously oxidize aqueous contaminants will be tested. To improve understanding of
transformation pathways and mechanisms, we will measure changes in concentration of target organics and
analyze newly formed by-products. For these laboratory tests, water collected from Puerto Rico will be mixed
with model contaminants and used for testing. The variations in toxicity levels and mechanistic profiles during
the course of the electrochemically induced degradation will disclose potential causal agents and their links to
the degradation pathways. Scaling of operational parameters and performance, geochemical and hydraulic
parameters during operation, toxicity evolution, and potential adverse effects will be investigated. We will also
assess the risk reduction efficacy of the process using a novel toxicogenomics-based toxicity assessment.
Expected Results: Based on this technology, a portable water, self-cleaning treatment system will be
designed and tested on water samples from Puerto Rico. The system will be engineered for inclusion into both
point-of-use and point-of-entry water treatment systems and can also be implemented in rural areas in the US
mainland that are not connected to public water systems."

Prostate cancer has become the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men in the United States (US) and a major
cause of cancer morbidity and mortality, with 33,000 American men (~90 every day) dying annually from the
disease. Considerable progress over the last decade resulted in the approval of multiple new hormonal and
cytotoxic therapies, each producing modest improvement in survival. Yet, despite a broad palette of therapeutic
options and the emerging promise of immunotherapy, the cure of metastatic prostate cancer has remained
elusive. However, over the past two decades, dedicated prostate cancer research, accomplished by Johns
Hopkins Prostate Cancer Program investigators and other researchers, led to a remarkable accumulation of
knowledge about the molecular mechanisms by which human prostate cancers arise and progress. These
studies identified adaptive autoregulation of androgen receptor activity, mutations and alterations in DNA-repair
pathways and an immunosuppressive microenvironment as fundamental characteristics of prostate cancer
producing resistance to hormonal, DNA-targeted and immune based therapies and allowing for progression that
eventually threatens life. To make significant advancement in the treatment of prostate cancer, the goal of this
new Prostate SPORE application is to translate new insights about the role played by adaptive changes in the
hormonal axis, DNA-repair and the immune system in the pathobiology of prostate cancer into new hypotheses
tested in clinical trials. The transcendent overall objective of the Johns Hopkins Prostate Cancer SPORE is
to reduce prostate cancer mortality via the focused pursuit of translational research in prostate cancer."

We have identified somatic gene recombination (SGR) in neurons of the human brain, with particular relevance
to sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (SAD) (Nature 563, 639-645 (2018)). This discovery represents a new and
functionally significant aspect of genomic mosaicism (eLife;4:e05116 (2015)) that has genuine therapeutic
potential through newly identified molecular targets. Indeed, we found that SGR, acting on the AD gene for
Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), produces thousands of distinct forms of APP, some of which are enriched in
or unique to AD. The APP gene variations related to AD that were analyzed thus far include copy number
variations (CNVs) and at least 11 single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) that were previously reported as
pathogenic in familial AD, yet that arose somatically and mosaically in SAD; these variations were absent from
non-diseased neurons. SGR utilizes reverse transcriptase (RT) activity on transcribed RNAs that, combined
with DNA strand-breaks and APP gene transcription, produce double-stranded DNA that is retro-inserted back
into the genome to form “genomic cDNAs” (gencDNAs). These published data contribute to the scientific
foundation on which the current proposal will build, to test the hypothesis that altered SGR, involving brain-
specific reverse transcriptases, functionally contributes to AD and affects multiple genes, providing novel targets
for AD therapies. Postmortem IRB-approved and de-identified brain samples from validated AD donors of both
sexes will be compared to non-diseased controls, while IACUC-approved animal experiments will model SGR
and its AD-relevant endpoints. Three Aims will be pursued over 5 years. Aim 1 will define the molecular
neurobiology of APP gencDNA diversity and identify new SGR genes enhanced in AD brains. Aim 2 will
determine expression and function of SGR genes in AD brain and model systems. Aim 3 will identify genes
responsible for RT SGR activity within normal and AD brains. This proposal will thus open new vistas into AD
via novel SGR mechanisms and will identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD."

Podocyte injury is the causative event in all proteinuric kidney diseases including minimal change disease
(MCD) and FSGS. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are often the initial and preferred treatment for these conditions. The
beneficial effects of GCs are not caused by immunomodulation, but are mediated by their direct effects on
podocytes. Unfortunately, GC therapy is riddled with severe systemic toxicities that limit their use. Identification
of essential salutary GC-induced targets in podocytes might allow for new therapeutic approaches that can
minimize toxicity but maintain efficacy. In the current proposal, we identified diminished expression of the
transcription factor dachshund1 (DACH1) in a large-scale mutagenic screen designed to identify mutations that
restored injury susceptibility to genetically injury-resistant podocytes. We found DACH1 to be essential to
podocyte function in both novel global and podocyte-specific knock out mouse models. Importantly, podocyte-
specific DACH1 heterozygous mice, which have reduced glomerular DACH1 expression levels similar to
human MCD and FSGS patients, were remarkably susceptible to adriamycin nephropathy, and this phenotype
was ameliorated by GC therapy. We found that GC administration caused early and significant induction of
DACH1 expression, and we confirm binding of GC receptor to the DACH1 promoter by ChIP assay. Moreover,
the protective allele of a DACH1 intronic SNP (rs626277), which has been identified in genome-wide
association studies as linked to incident and prevalent CKD, introduced a GC-alpha transcription factor-binding
site that was abrogated in the presence of the risk allele. When we tested these alleles in reporter studies, the
protective allele dramatically augmented DACH1 promoter activity in response to GCs, consistent with GC-
potentiated enhancer function. In GC treated kidney transplant patients, the protective rs626277 allele
correlated closely with increased glomerular DACH1 expression and improvement in proteinuria. Furthermore,
in a cohort of MCD and FSGS patients, protective and risk alleles correlated with GC responsiveness and
resistance respectively. We hypothesize that DACH1 is a central transcriptomic regulator of the salutary
glomerular GC response and that rs626277 genotype status, which modulates podocyte DACH1 transcription
in the setting of GC therapy, is an important determinant of GC-responsiveness in nephrotic syndrome
patients. Our proposal includes three specific aims: i) demonstrate that DACH1 over-expression is protective
using a novel inducible podocyte-specific DACH1 transgenic mouse model ii) show that the beneficial effects of
GCs in podocytes are mitigated in the absence of DACH1 expression using novel inducible podocyte-specific
knockout mice iii) correlate rs626277 genotype status with clinical outcomes in GC-treated MCD and FSGS
patients in NEPTUNE and cross-examine mechanistic and transcriptomic data obtained from the first two aims
in these patients. If validated, rs626277 genotype status could serve to individualize risk-benefit stratification of
GC therapy in nephrotic syndrome patients PRIOR to treatment initiation.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematopoietic malignancy characterized by aberrant self-renewal and
blocked differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells. Many of the oncogenic drivers of AML converge in
dysregulation of epigenetic and transcriptional regulation pathways, generating de novo dependencies on
these regulators. A handful of epigenetic dependencies have been identified in AML, however, single-agent
inhibitors against epigenetic regulators have shown limited therapeutic efficacy in patients with AML. To
improve our limited understanding of epigenetic-related synergistic genetic interactions in AML, we developed
a highly efficient CRISPR-Cas12a-based method enabling us to perform double deletion genetic screening.
Our preliminary studies identified and validated two pairs of novel interacting synthetic sick combinations of
epigenetic regulators in AML: bromodomain containing protein 9 (BRD9) and Jumonji domain-containing
protein 6 (JMJD6) as well as the lysine acetyltransferase 6 (KAT6) and JMJD6. JMJD6 is a bi-functional
arginine demethylase and lysyl-hydroxylase regulating transcription enhancer activation and was identified in
both synergistic pairs of epigenetic factor deletions. BRD9 is a component of chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF
complex and was previously identified as an AML specific dependency. KAT6A is a histone acetyltransferase
and transcriptional co-activator. We hypothesize that BRD9/JMJD6 and KAT6A/JMJD6 interact synergistically
at the level of transcription and chromatin. The presence of JMJD6 in both interactions suggests that JMJD6-
deficiency sets up a unique transcription and chromatin state that sensitizes AML cells to distinct epigenetic
stresses. In Aim 1, we will investigate the synthetic sick interactions of BRD9/JMJD6 and KAT6A/JMJD6 in
vitro and in vivo and in Aim 2, we will dissect the AML-specific synthetic sick interactions of BRD9/JMJD6 and
KAT6A/JMJD6 at the molecular level. Our proposed studies will offer basic mechanistic insight into how these
novel AML synthetic sick epigenetic interactions sustain AML pathogenesis. Successful completion of the
proposed studies holds significant promise towards developing innovative epigenetic pathway-directed
therapies and revealing fundamental biological insights into the pathogenesis of AML.

10769770,"The long-term goal of this project is to understand the molecular mechanisms that control gene
expression and developmental transitions. While transcription has been extensively studied, the
posttranscriptional mechanisms of RNA alternative splicing is much less understood despite of their
importance in cellular regulation, human health, and plant growth and development. We have
discovered that the Arabidopsis protein AtAcinus is evolutionarily related to but highly divergent from
the human Acinus protein, which plays important roles in regulating transcription, RNA alternative
splicing, and apoptosis. Our unpublished studies have shown that AtAcinus is modified by O-
GlcNAcylation, plays essential role in alternative splicing of a number of genes, many of which
encoding key components of signaling and developmental pathways. In particular, our data indicate
that AtAcinus play important roles in regulating seed germination and flowering, two major
developmental transition in plants. Using a combination of proteomics, genetics, genomic and
biochemical approaches in the Arabidopsis model system, we have made tremendous progress in
understanding the functions of AtAcinus. Our results support a hypothesis that AtAcinus is controlled
by O-GlcNAcylation in response to endogenous and environmental cues, and in turn it regulates key
cellular pathways through both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. In this proposal,
we plan to continue using the combination of proteomic, genomic and genetic approaches to further
advance our understanding of Acinus regulatory pathway. We will 1) dissect the molecular functions
of AtAcinus, particularly taking advantage of proximity labeling, cross-linking mass spectrometry and
biochemical fractionation, CLIP-seq and CLIP-MS technologies to understand how AtAcinus carries
out multiple functions (aim 1 and 3); 2) dissect how AtAcinus functions are regulated by post-
translational modifications (aim 2). The experiments outlined in this proposal will greatly advance
our understanding of the molecular mechanism of RNA alternatively splicing and O-GlcNAcylation
and the mechanisms of signal integration at post-transcriptional level. Given the evolutionary
conservation of Acinus, this study not only is important for plant biology and agriculture, but also can
potentially help us understand fundamental mechanisms of signaling and cellular regulation that are
relevant broadly."
10769771,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Impairments in reward processing and related behavior is a core symptom of addiction, chronic pain, and
mood disorders. Dysfunction of the ventral basal ganglia, which is comprised of the ventral pallidum (VP) and
nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) has been implicated in the etiology of affective symptoms in each of these
disorders. Canonical basal ganglia models posit that the VP is exclusively an output of the NAc. However, a
subpopulation of VP neurons project to the NAcSh, and reward-related neural activity in the VP precedes
reward-related activity in the NAcSh. It is completely unknown whether VP terminals in the NAcSh form
functional synapses, or whether this pathway modulates reward-related neural activity in the NAcSh or reward
behavior. Moreover, infusion of GABA or endogenous opioid (EOs) receptor agonists in the NAcSh potently
increases hedonic reactions to and consumption of reward. While VP neurons synthesize GABA and EOs, it
is not known whether the VP is a source of these compounds in the NAcSh. To mechanistically understand
how the basal ganglia coordinates reward behavior in health and disease, it is crucial to elucidate the
functional role of the VP-NAcSh pathway. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether NAcSh
projecting-VP neurons release GABA and EOs to inhibit NAcSh neurons, which increases hedonic responses
to rewards. To dissect the contribution of the VP-NAcSh pathway on reward-related behavior, we will first
establish the post-synaptic targets and neurochemical identity of VP-NAcSh pathway using viral tracing and
optogenetic-assisted circuit mapping (aim 1). We will next use in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetic
manipulations to determine the effect of VP-NAcSh pathway activation on reward-related behavior and
reward-related NAcSh activity in vivo (aim 2). We will determine whether the VP-NAcSh pathway releases
EOs in the NAcSh using a novel opto-dialysis approach to detect evoked peptide release in vivo. Finally, we
will elucidate whether EOs modulate function of the VP-NAcSh pathway using fISH and patch clamp
electrophysiology (aim 3). This proposal will re-examine the classical model of the basal ganglia, which posits
that the VP is exclusively an output structure of the NAc, and will determine the role of this pathway on NAcSh
activity reward-related behavior. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the circuit basis of impaired reward
processing in disease states, and to leverage this understanding to develop circuit-based therapies (such as
deep brain stimulation) to treat deficits in reward processing and related behavior in addiction, chronic pain
and substance use disorders."
10929549,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the United States, more than 40 percent of new cancer cases can be attributed to modifiable factors. Yet,
despite advances in knowledge regarding the multilevel factors associated with cancer risk, the annual number
of cancer cases is predicted to increase nearly 50%, from 1.5 million new cases in 2015 to approximately 2.3
million in 2050. Thus, a greater emphasis on cancer risk reduction and cancer control – along with a highly
trained workforce in this domain -- is needed to counter this projected increase. Recent advances in precision
medicine have resulted in great optimism for potential therapeutic options and may provide a ‘model’ for how to
evolve the field of cancer control. To realize the full potential of precision cancer control, it will be imperative to
not only assess biologic properties, but to also consider individual variabilities in behavioral, lifestyle, and
environmental factors. As a result, precision cancer control research requires multidisciplinary approaches that
enable seamless integration and collaboration to inform our understanding of how to identify those individuals
who are at elevated risk or who might benefit from specific, effective, and implementable interventions. Thus,
there is a significant need to equip the next generation of cancer control scientists with skills required to: (1)
precisely characterize the populations at increased risk for cancer or poor outcomes; (2) identify the multilevel
factors contributing to elevated risk or negative outcomes; and (3) develop and implement appropriate
interventions to effectively address those factors. This application for a new T32 postdoctoral training program
at Fox Chase Cancer Center is designed to prepare PhD and MD postdoctoral fellows to conduct innovative
research in precision cancer control with diverse populations. The transdisciplinary training includes a
complementary program of didactic activities and intensive mentored research experiences, which will equip
trainees to lead independent careers in precision cancer control. The Program Faculty include 25 mentors, all of
whom have established track records of obtaining peer-reviewed funding. We propose to enroll 2 postdoctoral
fellows each year (for two-year terms) over the five-year award. All fellows will receive rigorous training in the
principles of precision cancer control, research design and methodology, grant-writing, responsible conduct of
research, and career/professional skills development. T32 mentors are drawn from a broad base of exceptional
Cancer Center faculty with a breadth of expertise ranging from molecular biology, genetics, epidemiology,
biostatistics, geospatial technology, psychology, public health, and implementation science. The rich resources
available at Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC) include comprehensive genomic, biologic, sociocultural,
behavioral, and environmental-level data combined with advanced geospatial and statistical tools that will enable
our faculty and their trainees to apply precision cancer control methods in strategic efforts toward reducing cancer
risk and mortality across diverse populations."

The research and education of trainees in our Chemical Biology Interface (CBI) Program transcends molecular
scales, from the atomistic to the cellular level. We provide training and exposure in techniques to probe, design,
manipulate, or build molecules, biopolymers, biochemicals, macromolecules, and cellular systems, while
maintaining a solid foundation in a specific area of dissertation research. The mission of the program is to provide
mentorship and assistance in the students’ intellectual and career development for their entire time at the
University of Delaware. Our T32 CBI program, spanning 7 departments and 45 faculty trainers, is committed to
expanding the landscape of chemical biology research by providing multiple paths for trainee success. This
starts with a holistic approach to admissions that permits more than one entry point into the program, offering
plasticity that is important for diversity and inclusion. A flexible yet strong curriculum in CORE chemical biology
concepts, delivered using a required Chemical Biology Didactic Course, seamlessly blends lecture, seminar,
and laboratory experiences into 1 or 2 credit modular building blocks, with embedded required Responsible
Conduct of Research (RCR) and Rigor-Reproducibility training. Elective Boot Camps in Chemical Biology
Techniques builds students’ confidence to perform their thesis research. Our curriculum is inclusive, open to all
interested University of Delaware students curious about the chemical biology discipline. Dedicated, selfless
faculty who are essential for the success of the program are supported through genuine mentorship training
experiences such as “Mentoring Grand Rounds” and “Culturally Aware Mentor Training.” This mentoring
community provides the foundation for faculty to shepherd students through their tailored individual development
plans, assuring they utilize “out of laboratory” experiences such as: 1. Research Sabbaticals that serve to
broaden students’ understanding of career options, through dedicated, planned time away from the home
research lab and 2. Teaching Sabbaticals that expose students to modern pedagogy, such as Problem Based
Learning (PBL). Our alumni help fuel these out of field experiences, assuring consistent mentorship. Our
program holistically cares about the entire student as an individual and empowers them by providing unique
elements, such as a “Mindful Return” reentry plans post life-event. Intentional programming has built an
environment where differences are celebrated; the CBI Citizen is one who welcomes and encourages others
regardless of race, culture, sexual background, and/or disability. This model of inclusivity has allowed us to grow
our diversity to 42%, a number that we will strive to maintain as we admit 10 funded CBI Fellows for a funding
period average of 2 years. The University firmly believes that the T32 CBI is critical for its training and
research missions and has consistently committed multi-million dollar match funds to support our
program over its 29-year history, which synergizes with IDeA State COBRE funding mechanisms to directly
infuse excellence into our chemical biology program, training outcomes, and community."
10770670,"The Administrative Core (AC) of the Tulane Center of Biomedical Research Excellence in Sex-Based Precision
Medicine (COBRE in SPM) will perform functions critical to the ongoing success, sustainability, and growth of
our center. Specifically, the AC will oversee the mentoring plan for Research Project Leaders (RPLs) and Pilot
Project Leaders (PPLs), harmonize the components and activities of the COBRE, and foster interdisciplinary
collaborations and scientific opportunities. The specific aims of the AC are to 1) provide the administrative

10770674,"The overall goal of this proposal is to provide Dr. Yilin Yoshida, a project leader of the Tulane COBRE in Sex-
Based Precision Medicine (SPM), with indispensable training to develop expertise in precision epidemiology,
improve understanding of the sex disparities of diabetic cardiovascular disease (CVD) with a life-course
perspective, and optimize diabetic cardiovascular risk prediction. Women’s excessive CVD risk in type 2 diabetes
(T2D) relative to men is poorly understood. Potential mechanisms for this “female disadvantage” have been
primarily tested in middle-aged cohorts without adequately accounting for the cumulative burden of early-onset
T2D. In the past three decades, the greatest relative increases in T2D incidence and prevalence were observed
in young adults and adolescents triggered by escalating obesity rates. Notably, early-onset T2D exhibits a female
predominance in incidence and a more aggressive prognosis than late-onset T2D. A higher lifetime exposure to
risk factor clustering in women compared to men with early-onset T2D, compounded by the aggressive disease
course, may accelerate CVD risk in women in midlife. T2D is a heterogeneous disease with variable disease
progression, which is illustrated by the sex disparity in the risk of diabetic CVD. Emerging machine learning-
based research has sought to classify T2D patients to improve the prediction of complications but has not
incorporated sex-specific pathophysiological characteristics. This knowledge gap is concerning, as evidence
demonstrates that sex-specific mechanisms, partly driven by sex hormones, are instrumental in atherosclerosis,
adiposity, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction, underscoring sex-based differences in diabetic CVD.
Women with T2D also face greater metabolic and reproductive challenges than men across the lifespan, which
is implicated in women’s higher CVD risk. The phenotypic heterogeneities in T2D and CVD between men and
women warrant the consideration of sex in predicting CVD risk. In this study, the candidate proposes to
investigate the role of female sex in the deleterious influence of early-onset T2D on CVD using two intensively
phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. The Specific Aims are to 1) quantify the cumulative burden of T2D on CVD risk
in women compared to men and 2) identify sex-specific subgroups of individuals with T2D at high CVD risk. The
candidate has generated impactful preliminary findings for this proposal through support from her two-year K12
award. The candidate has identified critical next steps in this line of research and training areas to complement
her experience, including the pathophysiology of CVD and T2D, machine learning, health disparities research,
and sophisticated epidemiological methods for bias reduction. The candidate has successfully leveraged a
carefully coordinated set of resources, including a strong mentor team and applied learning activities closely
aligned with her training objectives and Specific Aims. This COBRE Research Project and training is essential
to advance the candidate’s career objective of becoming an independent, externally-funded investigator
specializing in sex-based precision epidemiology in cardiometabolic health."
10770424,"ABSTRACT:
Lewy body dementia is an Alzheimer’s disease–related dementia that affects more than one million Americans.
The strongest risk factor for this devastating neurodegenerative disease is mutation of the GBA gene, which
encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase). GBA mutations can impair the ability of GCase to
break down its substrate, the glycosphingolipid glucosylceramide (GlcCer), but it is not clear how defects in
GlcCer breakdown increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease–related dementias. To study this problem, we
created a fly lacking the Drosophila ortholog of GBA, Gba1b, as a model of GCase deficiency. Our Gba1b mutant
shows accumulation of GlcCer and recapitulates features of Alzheimer’s disease–related dementias including
neurodegeneration, brain protein aggregates, and age-related cognitive decline. We now propose to use the
Gba1b mutant to test a novel model of neurodegeneration associated with GCase deficiency, in which GlcCer
accumulation leads to neuroinflammation via changes in extracellular vesicles (EVs). In earlier work, we found
that Gba1b mutants had increased abundance and turnover of EV proteins, and that genetically suppressing
neuronal EV production ameliorated mutant phenotypes. More recently, RNA-Seq experiments revealed that
Gba1b mutants had marked innate immune activation. A followup RNAi screen of major innate immune pathways
found that neuronal knockdown of two p38 MAPK pathway components, the transcription factor Atf-2 and its
upstream kinase licorne, also suppressed Gba1b mutant phenotypes. Based on these and other findings, we
hypothesize that immune-mediated neurodegeneration in Gba1b mutants is a process driven by excess GlcCer
in two separate roles. Specifically, we hypothesize that excess GlcCer in neurons triggers ligand-independent
receptor tyrosine kinase activity and p38 MAPK signaling, stimulating EV release; GlcCer in the released EVs
then causes glia to secrete immune effector proteins, leading to protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. We
propose three aims to address these hypotheses. The first will delineate the intraneuronal signaling pathway that
leads to abnormal EV release; the second will investigate the nature of the EV alterations; the third will determine
how those EVs trigger immune effector secretion from glia. Given the abundant evidence for neuroinflammation
in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, we anticipate that our work will have broad medical significance."
10770426,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The UCSC IMSD Graduate Training Program aims to create an inclusive training experience that
increases the recruitment and retention of a diverse population of Ph.D. students into the biomedical sciences
and related fields. Building on decades of experience in promoting STEM diversity at the graduate and
undergraduate levels, we will support Ph.D. students during the crucial transition at the beginning of graduate
training. We will arm these students with the research and professionals skills to have successful careers in
academia, industry and related fields. At the same time, our program will promote an inclusive training
environment by engaging our faculty, staff and wider student population in discussions about the sources and
consequences of bias that remains in the many corners of academia. The UCSC IMSD Graduate Training
Program proposes to provide two years of support to 12 students who are admitted into one of four tracks of
the Program in Biomedical Sciences and Engineering (PBSE), which serves as an interdisciplinary umbrella
program involving over 70 investigators who study diverse topics in biomedical science. We will select
students who 1) have high potential for success in graduate studies, based on their demonstrated resilience in
overcoming a variety challenges, and 2) are motivated to become leaders in improving inclusivity in the
biomedical sciences during their future careers. In their first year, IMSD students will participate in the PBSE
laboratory rotation program and take core courses that emphasize rigor and reproducibility in experimental
design and conduct. They will also receive formal training in the responsible conduct of research and teaching.
Each student will also be paired with a faculty “master” mentor, who will aid in choosing rotation labs,
completing an IDP, and identifying a supportive thesis advisor. In the summer of their first year, IMSD students
will participate in a new “Proposal Bootcamp” designed to develop a thesis research proposal for fellowship
applications and a plan of study for qualifying exams that will take place in spring of their second year. In the
summer of their second year, students will participate in the IMSD Graduate Leadership Academy for Diversity
(GLAD), which we piloted last year. The program includes seminars, workshops, social justice journal club and
community events IMSD Graduate aimed at helping students develop independent research initiative and
mentorship skills. It also provides opportunities to explore career pathways and create a concrete career plan.
Finally, the program prepares students to further impact the campus' overall research climate by projecting
their own leadership skills to positively influence diversity and inclusion."
