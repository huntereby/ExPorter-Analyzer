The long-term goals and objectives of this proposal is to investigate host and virological factors associated with
oral transmission of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) utilizing the closely related rhesus
macaque rhadinovirus (RRV) infection of rhesus macaques (RM) model that parallels KSHV infection and
pathogenicity in humans. Like KSHV, RRV is a gamma-2 herpesvirus that is closely related to KSHV at the
genomic level, possessing essentially collinear genome organization. Pathologically, RRV closely resembles
KSHV, as we have shown that intravenous (iv) inoculation of RRV can induce KSHV-like disease manifestations
in RM co-infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Similarly, RM are infected with RRV early in life,
within the first 2 years, implying RRV infection mimics KSHV infection in children living in sub-Saharan Africa,
where KSHV is acquired early in life. Here, we will determine whether RRV can cross the oral mucosa to establish
infection, and identify the in vivo conditions necessary. These first of kind studies for RRV will be performed in
parallel with in vitro studies to interrogate viral glycoprotein receptor(s) density and cell types expressing the
receptor(s) in different regions of the oral cavity, as a means to define the mechanism for transmission. Lastly,
as we have created an infectious and pathogenic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone of wild type RRV
(WT-RRVBAC) that provides a molecular genetic system to interrogate viral factors that are necessary for
infection, we will undertake a molecular approach to interrogate viral encoded factors that facilitate KSHV
infection across the oral mucosa. Specifically, we hypothesize that RRV envelope glycoproteins gB, gH, gL, gM
and potentially gR8.1 are necessary for binding to receptors on susceptible cells and that KSHV glycoproteins
gB, gH, gL, gM and gK8.1 can functionally substitute for RRV glycoprotein homologues. Hence, establishing this
chimeric virus system will enable researchers and vaccinologists, the ability to target the viral glycoproteins for
vaccine approaches in a nonhuman primate (NHP) model."
10901849,"This proposal studies two fatal, neurological lysosomal storage diseases, Type A/B and Type C Niemann-Pick
disease (NPA/B and NPC, respectively). NPA/B is due to an inherited deficiency of the enzyme acid
sphingomyelinase (ASM), leading to the accumulation of the sphingolipid, sphingomyelin (SPM), in cells and
tissues of affected patients. In contrast, ~95% of patients with NPC have a defect in the cholesterol transport
protein, NPC1, leading to a primary defect in cholesterol storage. Despite their distinct genetic and protein
defects, the pathological and clinical presentation of NPA/B and NPC overlap. For example, ~50% of NPA/B
patients and all patients with NPC suffer from debilitating and life-threatening central nervous system (CNS)
complications, and no effective therapies exist. To address this important unmet medical need, in preliminary
studies we have generated a range of data supporting the use of a novel endocannabinoid (ECB)-based
treatment for these disorders. For example, we have found that inhibitors of the enzyme fatty acid amide
hydrolase (FAAH), which elevate several ECBs, significantly lowered SPM in cultured neurons and tissues of
Type A/B NPD mice, leading to CNS improvements and extension of lifespan. We also found a significant
down-regulation of the type-1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) expression on the surface of neurons from these
mice and in brain tissue from a patient with NPA, due to entrapment of the receptor within the lysosome. This
abnormality was corrected by FAAH inhibition. Similarly, treatment of NPC mouse neurons with FAAH
inhibitors led to a reduction of both SPM and cholesterol, and there was a down-regulation of CB1R expression
on the surface of these cells as well. Based on these preliminary findings, we propose that FAAH
inhibition could be a novel and highly effective treatment for the CNS disease in both NPA/B and NPC,
and that repurposing existing FAAH inhibitors that cross the blood brain barrier might be rapidly
translatable to patients. To pursue this goal and further understand the relatedness of these disorders, three
specific aims are proposed: 1) Characterize the molecular mechanism(s) underpinning the protective effects of
FAAH inhibition in NPA/B cells and mice; 2) Investigate the function of the ECB system in NPC, and further
explore FAAH inhibition as a potential treatment for this disease, and; 3) Use system biology and multi-omic
approaches to compare the pathways and networks impacted in NPA/B and NPC, and to obtain a global
picture of the molecular changes resulting from FAAH inhibition. We also hope to provide further insights
regarding the relatedness of these ultra rare diseases to common neurologic diseases with which they share
significant CNS pathology, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease."

 The purpose of the South Dakota Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (SoDakPCTN) is to
leverage the enthusiasm and growth in pediatric research over the last decade to build capacity
and skills in clinical trials. This momentum was developed through active collaborations over the
past two decades in community-based research with tribal nations, health clinics and hospitals
to help improve the health of children in South Dakota. While South Dakota has been a regional
leader in large scale longitudinal multi-site observational studies (e.g., Safe Passage Study,
ECHO pediatric cohort), opportunities to participate in pediatric clinical research have been
limited. SoDakPCTN will be housed within the Avera Health system, a large health system
comprised of 300 locations in 100 communities throughout South Dakota and areas of the four
surrounding states. The Avera Health system includes 35 hospitals and 34 community and
critical access hospitals. The Avera health system and partners are ideally suited to conduct
high quality pediatric clinical trials that specifically reach rural, frontier, and American Indian (AI)
populations across South Dakota. The Center for Pediatric and Community Research (CPCR)
at Avera has worked to establish a robust pediatric research infrastructure that allows for large -
scale longitudinal studies that already occur within clinics, hospitals and communities across the
state, with offices in Sioux Falls, Rapid City and Pine Ridge.
 SoDakPCTN will be built around three specific aims. First, build upon existing pediatric
research infrastructure to create a collaborative environment that supports state -of-the-art
pediatric clinical trials in inpatient, outpatient, and community-based settings. Second, support
career development for junior investigators and research staff in conducting pediatric clinical
trials through mentorship, professional development opportunities, and introduction to potential
hospital, clinic, and community partners. Third, using a community engaged approach, develop
research dissemination strategies and translate research findings to clinical and community
stakeholders to improve knowledge and practice."

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus
that was first isolated in Wuhan China in December, 2019. SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19), which is now a pandemic and has caused more than 1.3 million confirmed cases and 72,000
deaths, with an estimated case fatality rate of 4%, with substantially higher death rates (~15%) in the elderly or
immunocompromised. Virtually all countries and territories have reported cases, with major epidemics in China,
Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Iran, and the United States. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be of zoonotic origin, most
likely bats, and is about 75% identical to the original SARS-CoV. Most cases are spread by direct human-to-
human transmission, with community transmission in asymptomatic individuals described. Currently, no
countermeasures are licensed for human use. The development, characterization, and ultimately deployment of
an antibody-based treatment against SARS-CoV-2 could prevent substantial morbidity and mortality, and
possibly mitigate its epidemic spread. This interactive multi-PI proposal leverages complementary expertise in
the Diamond, Crowe, and Baric laboratories to rapidly develop highly neutralizing and therapeutic human
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 for immediate use in humans. To achieve this goal, we will
generate and interrogate human mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 that are obtained from multiple convalescent
subjects. We will identify potently neutralizing mAbs and optimize them for affinity by selecting naturally occurring
somatic variants identified by repertoire sequencing and sibling analysis and Fc effector functions. Protective
activity of top candidate coronavirus mAbs will be tested in newly-generated and optimized mouse models of
SARS-CoV-2 infection, including those expressing human ACE2 receptors (hACE2). To define correlates of
protection, we will use chimeric viruses, shotgun mutagenesis, and neutralization escape to identify the epitopes
of our most protective mAbs. Our team has extensive experience in the generation, characterization and
optimization of antibodies, CoV biology, and animal models of disease and protection. A therapy composed of
one to three highly neutralizing mAbs may provide an immediate countermeasure against the pandemic spread
of SARS-CoV-2 and help establish correlates of structural and functional humoral protection that ultimately
inform vaccine efforts."

Intervertebral disc degeneration is a major etiological factor of low back pain, which is the #1 cause of job
disability worldwide that affects 80% of people at least once in their lifetime. Older individuals are prone to
intervertebral disc degeneration by a loss of disc height and hydration. Pain can worsen intervertebral disc
degeneration by limiting mobility and reducing the mechanical forces necessary for homeostasis. Therefore,
there is an unmet need to safely protect older individuals from intervertebral disc degeneration and, here, we
intend to repurpose existing bone therapeutics to reduce/prevent intervertebral disc loss and consequently back
pain in the aging population. Intervertebral disc degeneration remains a growing problem because (1) the US
geriatric population is projected to outnumber children for the first time in history, (2) the early treatment of
intervertebral disc degeneration remains palliative and (3) the ballooning socioeconomic burden. We are
uniquely positioned to bridge the knowledge gap in the molecular mechanisms of bone therapeutics to stem
intervertebral disc degeneration. Aging and mechanical injury of the intervertebral disc by compression both
exacerbate breakdown of the extracellular matrix, but compression stimulates inflammation more so than aging.
By contrast, we recently found that deletion of the inhibitor of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling sost, a bone formation
anabolic mechanism and the genetic analog approach to anti-sclerostin antibody injection, increases the
structural properties and hydration of the intervertebral disc. Another bone therapeutic that shows benefits to the
intervertebral disc is anti-resorptive raloxifene, a non-uterine-targeting estrogen agonist, that also increases
binding of water to collagen. Use of raloxifene in postmenopausal women is associated with relieving back pain
and greater intervertebral disc height than non-treated women. Our studies show that raloxifene increases
intervertebral disc height in male and female mice, reduces sex- and age-related intervertebral disc degeneration
in female mice, improves metrics of pain-related behavior in old mice and stimulates Wnt and estrogen signaling.
Here, we hypothesize that currently available therapeutics will stimulate extracellular matrix anabolism and
prevent compression-induced intervertebral disc degeneration in young and aged mice. To test this hypothesis,
we propose two aims using aged mice and catabolic compression as models of intervertebral disc degeneration.
In aim 1, we will determine whether therapeutics known to activate Wnt signaling will prevent IVD degeneration
by injurious mechanical compression in young and aged mice. In aim 2, we will determine whether estrogen
signaling prevents IVD degeneration via Wnt signaling and whether prevention can be safely improved by
combining the signaling pathways in aged mice. This proposal will repurpose current FDA-approved bone
prophylactics that target pathways consistently impacted by intervertebral disc degeneration in variable
conditions and may be specifically beneficial to intervertebral disc degeneration in the elderly."

The Connecticut Department of Public Health (CT DPH) State Public Health Laboratory (SPHL) is currently
participating in the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) Retail Meat
Surveillance program through Food and Drug Administration/Center for Veterinary Medicine
(FDA/CVM). The goal of this surveillance project is to determine the prevalence of antibiotic resistance
among Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, Vibrio, Aeromonas, and other lactose
positive bacteria isolated from retail food samples purchased from grocery stores in the United States
This surveillance project is intended to improve the detection of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in
food commodities. This application will seek funding to support CT DPH SPHL’s participation in the
NARMS retail meat surveillance program including designated personnel who will be responsible for
surveillance activities. The activities in this surveillance project include a) collecting and processing 20
retail meat samples from pre-selected grocery stores throughout Connecticut twice a month for a total
of 40 samples, samples include 10 chicken, 10 ground turkey, 10 ground beef, and 10 retail pork (ground
or chops); (b) purchasing 8 seafood samples once a month from the same stores the retail meat is

Ascaris remains a significant health problem in many parts of the world, infecting close to a billion people,
many of them children, leading to significant morbidity. The related parasitic nematode Toxocara, causing
human toxocariasis, also is increasingly being recognized as a significant public health problem in the United
States. These parasitic nematodes undergo a novel form of genome re-organization, known as programmed
DNA elimination. Very little is known regarding the function and molecular mechanisms of this DNA elimination
process. Our recent work provides fundamental insights into this process demonstrating that DNA elimination
is a conserved process in a group of parasitic nematodes serving to silence germline-expressed genes,
particularly testis-specific genes, through their elimination in the somatic cells. Furthermore, we defined how
holocentric chromosomes are dynamically re-organized to determine chromosomes regions that will be kept or
eliminated. During Ascaris DNA elimination, DNA double-strand breaks are required to generate chromosomal
fragments that will be eliminated. We identified 72 telomere addition sites where the presumed chromosomal
breaks occur. These sites exhibit high fidelity in different somatic cell lineages and worms constrained within 3-
6 kb genomic regions and are called chromosomal breakage regions. Our analysis did not identify any specific
sequence, structural features or common epigenetic factors that might specify or recruit molecular machinery
to these regions. However, a prominent feature for these break regions is they become more chromatin
accessible just before DNA elimination. Open chromatin is often a result of molecular processes that access
the genome, including DNA replication and RNA transcription. In this proposal, we hypothesize that RNA
transcription, R-loops, and/or DNA replication stress, as well as the three-dimensional genome organization
may contribute to the key DNA breaks that initiate DNA elimination. We will examine these hypotheses in three
specific aims: (1). Define when DNA break and telomere addition occurs during the cell cycle that leads to a
DNA elimination mitosis; (2). Define DNA replication timing and stress, RNA transcription, and R-loops during
DNA elimination; and (3). Map the 3D genome organization of the break regions. In addition to an
understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the DNA breaks for Ascaris DNA elimination, the proposed
studies will provide new information and insights into parasitic nematode chromosomes and chromatin
organization, RNA transcription, DNA replication, DNA breaks and end resection, and telomere healing.
Insights into these biological processes may identify novel molecular processes that could be potential drug
targets in parasitic nematodes."

Environmental genotoxins such as oxidation agents, alkylating agents, aromatic amines, crosslinking agents,
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and natural toxins induce a full spectrum of DNA lesions including abasic
sites, interstrand crosslinks, and bulky DNA base adducts. These environmental genotoxins are found in our
waterways, food, industrial and agricultural chemicals, and air pollution and have the potential to induce
mutagenesis and genomic instability if genetic lesions are not repaired. Mutagenesis and genomic instability can
lead to developmental disorders, aging, and cancers. HMCES is a replication-coupled repair protein that
responds to single-strand DNA abasic sites and prevents their cleavage by AP-endonucleases. Abasic sites are
a common lesion caused by environmental genotoxins. My preliminary results suggest that HMCES prevents
both genomic instability and mutagenesis, and I hypothesize that it promotes a more faithful repair mechanism
such as template switching or fork reversal. For the K99-phase of this proposal I will learn to perform short and
long-term mutagenesis assays and DNA deep sequencing methods to understand in detail how HMCES
prevents mutagenesis and genomic instability in human cells and promotes more error-free repair. This work will
create a technical foundation and blueprint for studies (R00) characterizing the strand-specific replication stress
response and how strand-specific obstacles and environmental genotoxins contribute to leading and lagging
strand mutagenesis. There are core differences between replication on the leading and lagging strands. DNA
replication occurs continuously on the leading strand and discontinuously on the lagging strand through a series
of repriming events. I hypothesize that strand-specific lesions and obstacles generate a differential replication
stress response, and potentiate mutagenesis differently. I will characterize the lagging and leading strand stress
responses using unbiased approaches. Further, I will determine the consequences of strand-specific stress and
genotoxins on mutagenic strand bias using deep sequencing-based mutagenesis assays. Ultimately, this
proposal will advance the environmental toxicology and DNA repair fields leading to paradigm shifting
discoveries."

Treg cells are enriched within the tissues, one of their main sites of action and possess a number of
adaptations that allow them to thrive and maintain a stable lineage identity. One of these critical features is an
altered metabolic profile. We have explored how the metabolism of various tissue environments, especially
within tumors, stabilize regulatory T cell function. Tumors produce a local metabolic environment that is toxic to
conventional, effector T cells, but regulatory T cells thrive there, being highly proliferative and maintaining
stable function. Metabolic derangement of cancer cells and the potentiation of regulatory T cell function are
linked: we have recently shown that Treg cells are supported by tumor-derived metabolites, most notably lactic
acid. Treg cells eschew glucose metabolism, upregulating genes allowing them to withstand lactic acid-rich
conditions and utilize this metabolite to fuel their function. Foxp3-restricted deletion of the lactate transporter
monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1, encoded by Slc16a1), hindered Treg function within tumors, resulting in
a more immunologically active environment. Importantly, Treg cell-targeting immunotherapies like CTLA-4
blockade drives Treg cells to utilize glucose rather than lactate. Notably, this Treg utilization of glucose vs.
lactate was not limited to tumors, but also found in the peripheral tissues of mice. While deletion of MCT1
resulted in no autoimmunity at the steady state, MCT1-deficient Treg cells were unable to sufficiently control
intestinal inflammation in a T cell transfer model. Even in isolation, high glucose concentrations can hinder
Treg cell function and stability, while lactate can protect against these differentiation events. Mechanistically,
lactate broadly supports Treg cell proliferation and function, but how alternative pathways like lactate
metabolism support and drive Treg cell identity remains unclear. Treg cells are not solely programmed by
Foxp3, but rather rely on an established epigenetic landscape that supports their function, both in where Foxp3
can bind but also other key transcription factors. It now is clear that metabolic intermediates play critical roles
in epigenetic remodeling, as histones can be either directly modified by metabolites (acetylation) or modified
through metabolic processes (demethylation requiring αKG). Recently, lactate itself has been shown to directly
modify histones, although the epigenetic consequences of histone lactylation remain incompletely described.
Our preliminary data suggest that Treg cells harbor elevated lactylation of histones in an MCT1-dependent
manner, and that Treg cells with increased lactylation harbor a more stable Treg cell signature. Here we will
address the hypothesis that metabolites, most notably lactate, enriched in the tissues drive regulatory T cell
functional identity, using in vivo systems in which Treg cells are either unfavorably stabilized (cancer) or
struggle to control immunity (intestinal inflammation), coupling novel mouse models with functional and
epigenetic analyses feasible to profile these rare cells. This work will transform our understanding of how
context/tissue-specific cues like metabolites can help shape Treg cell function and fate."

Lymphatic vessels play critical roles in regulating tissue fluid drainage, dietary fat absorption, and reverse
cholesterol transport. Fulfilling these important physiological functions requires proper development of the
lymphatic vasculature, which is mainly driven by vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C). VEGF-C
signaling also stimulates pathological lymphangiogenesis in tumors and organ transplantation, which may, in
turn, promote cancer metastasis and allograft rejection respectively. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms by
which VEGF-C signaling drives lymphangiogenesis will not only enhance the fundamental understanding of
physiological processes regulated by lymphatics, but also facilitate the development of novel anti-
lymphangiogenic strategies for disease treatments. We previously discovered that lymphatic endothelial cells
(LECs), even when grown in an oxygen-rich environment, preferentially convert glucose to lactate. This unique
metabolic feature is termed the Warburg effect. Despite this finding, it remains unclear whether and how the
Warburg effect is regulated by VEGF-C signaling for promoting developmental and pathological
lymphangiogenesis. Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) catalyzes the reduction of pyruvate to lactate and the
regeneration of oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) from its reduced form NADH. Our preliminary
studies suggest that LDHA mediates the Warburg effect in LECs. We also found that genetic ablation of Ldha in
mice impairs LEC proliferation and migration during lymphatic vascular development. Moreover, VEGF-C
enhances LDHA transcription and lactate generation in LECs. These data collectively support our central
hypothesis that LDHA couples VEGF-C signaling with cellular metabolism to drive lymphangiogenesis, which
will be tested through two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will use genetic mouse models and cultured LECs to determine
the molecular mechanisms by which VEGF-C signaling induces LDHA expression during lymphatic vessel
formation. Aim 2 will combine several advanced analytical tools to elucidate the mechanisms by which LDHA
controls cellular metabolism to promote lymphangiogenesis. Taken together, our proposed studies will identify
LDHA as a novel mechanistic link between VEGF-C signaling and metabolic processes critical for lymphatic
vessel formation. Our work may also suggest an innovative strategy, i.e., targeting the Warburg effect via LDHA
inhibition, for suppressing VEGF-C-induced pathological lymphangiogenesis."
10874322,"PROJECT SUMMARY (OVERALL):
The scientific theme of the “MassaChusetts General Hospital ROybal CeNter For BehavIoral Dyadic ResEarch in
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias” (CONFIDE-ADRD) is the development, optimization, testing and
implementation of dyadic behavioral prevention interventions (DBPIs) across the spectrum of ADRD in both hospital and
community settings, to improve health and prevent negative individual and dyadic health outcomes. ADRDs (herein called
dementias) are progressive, debilitating, and terminal illnesses associated with progressive negative health outcomes.
Dementia drastically alters the lives of both the person diagnosed and their informal care-partner (spouses, children, other
family, friends), and often disrupts established roles, identities, relationships, and future plans. Most dementia interventions
focus on patients or care-partners alone, without accounting for their interrelation and interpersonal processes. The few
existing dyadic behavioral interventions are limited because: 1) they often lack dyadic theoretical foundation and conceptual
framework; 2) they are not mapped onto the NIH stage model; 3) they do not use principles of the Science of Behavior
Change (SOBC) to inform dyadic mechanisms of change and appropriate measurement; 4) they are not developed across
the spectrum of primary, secondary or tertiary prevention; 5) they do not incorporate the NIA Health Disparities Framework
to provide a mechanistic understanding of health disparities and levels of analyses relevant to dyadic research; and 6) they
do not account for dyadic interdependence and interpersonal relationships to maximize potency and avoid negative effects
for one of the partners. CONFIDE-ADRD will address these limitations and catalyze the development of interdisciplinary
research to create, test and implement innovative and rigorous DBPIs mapped onto our novel conceptual model that
incorporates the NIH Stage Model, SOBC, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention model, the NIA Health Disparities
Framework and dyadic theory. CONFIDE-ADRD will: 1) develop a diverse, next generation of scientists committed to
dementia DBPIs; 2) use an experiential learning approach to dementia DBPI research that prioritizes mechanisms of
behavior change; 3) will swiftly move DBPIs across the NIH Stage Model for effective and efficient implementation. Our
three overarching aims will be met by the Center’s two cores. The Administrative Core will: 1) coordinate the Center’s
activities, promote interactions and networking among pilot awardees, co-investigators and collaborating partners; 2)
integrate with local and national centers, institutes and organizational partners; 3) use experiential learning activities (e.g.,
DBPI Salon, grant writing workshops, mock grant reviews) to provide hands on learning of relevant DBPI research aspects.
The Behavioral Intervention Development Core will provide awardees with support and practical experience in working
with a dedicated research team to conduct DBPI pilot research that is feasible, rigorous, and mechanistic, prioritizing the
patient-care-partner relationship. The MPIs (Vranceanu & Okereke) are senior investigators with extensive expertise in the
NIH stage model, dementia care, dyadic research, leadership and mentoring, and, with support from nationally acclaimed
investigators and local and national resources, are well poised to lead this center."

Mechanosensitive ion channels were shown to drive mechanically induced inflammatory signaling in the central
and peripheral nervous systems and to exacerbate pathology in neuropathies, skeletal diseases, traumatic brain
injury and other neurodegenerative conditions. Suppressing their activation with gene knockdown and
pharmacology reduces inflammatory neuropathy and neuronal injury yet despite this knowledge their role in
neuroinflammation is little understood, and their contribution to pressure-associated retinal diseases such as
glaucoma has never been investigated. The goal of the proposed project is to resolve this major gap in
knowledge by defining the molecular targets of intraocular pressure in the principal retinal macroglia, the Müller
cell, and establish the significance of Müller pressure sensing for neuroinflammation, glia-neuronal interactions
and neurodegeneration.
The overall hypothesis of this project is that mechanosensitive TRP and piezo channels trigger and drive
inflammatory activation in the presence of mechanical stressors such as intraocular pressure and strain and that
this process can be targeted by pharmacological/genetic methods to alleviate neuronal injury. We will address
this hypothesis in two specific aims. Aim 1 focuses on the characterization of properties of mechanoactivated
ion channels that mediate pressure signaling in Müller cells. In Aim 2 we propose to take advantage of new
conditional mouse models to elucidate how pressure elevations induce reactive gliosis, the role of
mechanotransduction in glia-glia and glia-neuronal circuits, and significance of this mechanism for ganglion cell
stress and survival. Successful completion of these multidisciplinary, thematically related yet independent
approaches may help define new diagnostic and treatment strategies in hypertensive glaucoma."

Group B Streptococcus (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae) is a dominant cause of bacterial morbidity and
mortality for newborns and infants in the United States and around the world. Globally, GBS sepsis and
meningitis occur among approximately 400,000 young children annually, leading to 90,000 deaths. While a
portion of these infections develop antenatally or during the birth process, a large percentage develop after the
first week of life, which is termed “late-onset” GBS infection. In the United States, late-onset infection is now
the most common presentation of GBS disease. Unlike early-onset infection (during the first week of life), late-
onset infection is unaffected by perinatal administration of prophylactic antibiotics to the delivering mother.
There is currently no effective, scalable strategy for preventing late-onset GBS infection. This proposal seeks
to make fundamental discoveries about an essential and poorly understood first step in late-onset infection
pathogenesis: colonization of the newborn intestine by GBS, which can then progress to transluminal invasion
and systemic spread. Our central hypothesis is that GBS uses surface-trafficked proteins to bind to,
persist on, and invade neonatal intestinal surfaces. Understanding these key GBS protein-host interactions
would open avenues toward vaccine- or antibody-based therapies to interrupt initial neonatal GBS intestinal
persistence. We will test our hypothesis using novel, highly efficient GBS genetic modification tools, including a
system recently developed and validated by the PI for CRISPR/Cas-mediated GBS gene repression
(CRISPRi), and developmentally appropriate human fetal tissue-derived enteroid and mouse models of
neonatal intestinal colonization and infection. Our approaches will allow unprecedented, multidimensional
interrogation of a set of 70 highly conserved, surface-trafficked GBS proteins to understand the role of each

The goals of the Mouse VMN (vascular, metabolism, network) Core B are to serve the P01 Projects with cutting-
edge methods specifically tailored to the P01 themes: Strategies for Targeting Astrocyte Reactivity in AD and
ADRD (STAR-AD-ADRD). Astrocytes support brain function by integrating their roles with several cell types.
They support neurons and regulate blood flow to supply and preserve active brain regions. Astrocytes become
reactive in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (ADRD) and their functions are
not fully understood. Our group at the Sanders-Brown Center on Aging including Drs. Wilcock, Thibault, Norris,
and Nelson investigate roles of astrocytes, neurons and vascular pathology in aging and AD/ADRD brain. These
research topics are inter-connected and the success of this P01 will move our understanding of reactive
astrocytes beyond neuroinflammation constraints. Our VMN Core will provide multiple approaches to
characterize the roles of reactive astrocytes on cerebrovascular function, brain metabolism and neuronal network
activity. Moreover, results uniformly generated from our core will permit useful comparisons across projects. The
Specific aims are to: (1) Coordinate for small animal surgeries and intravital imaging techniques, including
training and oversight. (2) Coordinate all brain slice electrophysiology experiments. (3) Coordinate and provide
service for microelectrode array experiments. (4) Coordinate and provide service for Magnetic Resonance
Imaging experiments. Furthermore, our Core will work with the DMB (Data Management and Biostatistics)
Core D, where the results will be stored, processed and easily accessed from our collaborative groups both in
UK and beyond."
10897077,"PROJECT 1 ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) are a major cause of dementia, both alone
and co-morbid with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD Related Dementias (ADRD). Astrocytic end-feet are
physically anchored to the vascular basement membranes via dystroglycan complexes. At the end-feet are
potassium and water channels Kir4.1 and aquaporin 4 (AQP4), as well as monocarboxylic acid transporters
(MCTs). AQP4 and Kir4.1 channels are polarized at the end-foot and are co-anchored via a -syntrophin-
dystrophin 1 complex. We have found that cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) induced by
hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) resulted in degeneration and dissociation of the astrocytic end-feet and an
associated loss of AQP4 and Kir4.1 from the end-feet. This suggests that the end-feet are particularly
susceptible to vascular injury and as such may mediate neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration
associated with dementia. We have observed increased activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), in
particular MMP9, coincident with astrocytic end-foot degeneration. We therefore hypothesize that MMP9 is
necessary and sufficient for astrocytic end-foot degeneration and associated neurovascular coupling,
and metabolic and ionic dyshomeostasis.
We will test our hypothesis in mice by manipulating MMP9 in our well-characterized HHcy mouse model of VCID
and our multi-modal, multi-faceted outcome measures leverage the specific expertise of our Cores including
intravital, MRI/MRS, and electrophysiological measures provided by Core B, and human tissue, images, and
biospecimens from Core C. We collaborate extensively with Projects 2-4 to determine relationships between
end-foot disruption and glutamate transporters, K+ATP channels, and insulin transporters. All data will flow
through Core D to quantitatively assess relationships between MMP9 and astrocytic and neuronal function within
this Project and across all Projects in our P01—Strategies for Targeting Astrocyte Reactivity in ADRD P01.
To test our hypothesis, we propose three distinct aims.
 Specific Aim 1: MMP9 mediated astrocytic end-foot degeneration will result in cerebrovascular dysfunction
 impaired neurovascular coupling.
 Specific Aim 2: MMP9 mediated astrocytic end-foot degeneration will result in metabolic and ionic
dyshomeostasis.
 Specific Aim 3: Astrocytic end-foot degeneration results in profound changes in gene and protein expression
 and end-foot proteins can be used as biomarkers of end-foot degeneration."
10899221,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite the vast improvement in screening techniques and therapies, breast cancer remains the second leading
cause of cancer deaths in females worldwide. Approximately 30% of tumors progress to metastatic disease that
is incurable. Metastatic breast cancers are highly proliferative and thus rely on rapid deoxynucleotide production.
This is supported by increased activity of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), a multimeric enzyme that is rate
limiting for dNTP synthesis. RNR is an attractive therapeutic target for metastatic breast cancer, with the RNR
inhibitor, gemcitabine, being FDA-approved to treat advanced disease. Inhibition of RNR causes excessive DNA
damage and chromosomal instability (CIN) that inhibits breast cancer cell growth. However, gemcitabine is a
nucleoside analog and, as such, has considerable off-target effects on numerous enzymes and displays severe
dose-limiting toxicities (i.e. myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity). The development of a novel, non-nucleoside RNR
inhibitor would potentially revolutionize patient care by inhibiting tumor growth without the toxicities associated
with gemcitabine. This application describes the evaluation of TMU27a, a first-in-class RNR inhibitor that induces
DNA damage and CIN in breast cancer cells and inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft breast cancer model without
inducing overt toxicities. Proposed studies will expand these analyses to numerous human and mouse cell lines
to investigate the impact of TMU27a on genome stability as well as its efficacy and safety compared to
gemcitabine in preclinical breast cancer models. These studies will determine if TMU27a provides a foundational
agent that is an effective and safe inhibitor of breast cancer growth. In addition, this project will elucidate how
TMU27a binds to and inhibits RNR using cryo-electron microscopy. Preliminary data show that TMU27a tightly
binds to the RRM1 subunit, and it likely binds within the catalytic site. Furthermore, TMU27a is predicted to be
unable to bind in the nucleotide binding pocket of DNA polymerase lambda, a common off-target binding side of
gemcitabine that contributes to its toxicity. Understanding how TMU27a inhibits RNR and blocks tumor growth
will provide an avenue for designing a novel class of non-nucleoside RNR inhibitors that act with high specificity,
potency, and efficacy while avoiding side effects evident with nucleoside analogs such as gemcitabine."
10893638,"Summary/Abstract
Preterm births occur in 10% of US births, cause 36% of infant mortality, and cost $26 billion each year. Repeat
preterm births represent approximately 20% of total prematurity. Preventive care that effectively addresses
modifiable risks (e.g. tobacco use, weight status, interpregnancy interval) among women with a prior preterm
birth could plausibly reduce overall preterm birth rates by 10% or more. However, our preliminary work found
that 39% of Medicaid-insured women with a prior preterm birth received no preventive care in the year after
pregnancy. Leveraging existing contact between pediatric health systems and new mothers, this research
proposes a pediatric-based nurse intervention as a novel strategy to reduce prematurity. We hypothesize
that nurse care coordination will increase receipt of preventive care. In addition, we propose embedding
motivational interviewing within the care coordination model to address modifiable health risks. We
hypothesize that this care coordination plus motivational interviewing intervention will increase receipt of
preventive care and reduce modifiable behavioral risks, thus improving subsequent birth outcomes. The
proposed intervention builds on existing care coordination models and on prior work demonstrating feasibility
of maternal risk screening in pediatrics. This intervention innovates over existing interconception (IC) care
models by: (1) locating our intervention in the pediatric health care system to capitalize on existing interactions,
(2) focusing on strategies to address needs and risks identified through screening, and (3) implementing
motivational interviewing within care coordination to better address modifiable risks. The candidate, Dr.
Gregory, has conducted prior maternal-child health research focused on the IC period. Her long-term goal is to
become an independent maternal-child health researcher developing clinical programs to improve birth
outcomes. This five-year mentored research proposal will support her goal through course work and
completion of mentored research. Candidate training will focus on three objectives: (1) motivational
interviewing, an evidence-based behavior change strategy, (2) implementation science, and (3) pragmatic
clinical trials. Research will address two specific aims. (Aim 1) will adapt care coordination and motivational
interviewing for women with a prior preterm birth. Using mixed methods, and starting with existing models of
pediatric care coordination, adaptation will focus on the needs of women with a history of preterm birth and on
integration of motivational interviewing. (Aim 1a: qualitative interviews; Aim 1b: iterative testing.) (Aim 2) will
conduct a pilot pragmatic randomized trial of usual care vs care coordination plus motivational interviewing for
women with a prior preterm birth. This trial will demonstrate intervention feasibility and estimate the effect size
of the intervention on health care utilization. Findings will inform an R01 level trial testing this intervention as a
strategy to reduce repeat preterm birth. This proposal aligns with NICHD research priorities of improving the
health of women before, during, and after pregnancy and improving pregnancy outcomes."
10893639,"ABSTRACT
Humans produce each day ~100 million autoreactive B-cells that express potentially harmful autoantibodies.
This burden of autoreactive B-cells requires a powerful purging mechanism, termed central tolerance, to prevent
autoimmune disease. During the previous period of this R01, we discovered that central tolerance mechanisms
not only remove newly formed autoreactive B-cells but also eliminate B-cell tumors that originate from early
stages of B-cell development, namely B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)
and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Hence, central tolerance could represent a previously unrecognized
vulnerability in B-cell tumors that is orthogonal to conventional mechanisms of drug-resistance.
B-ALL represents the most frequent type of cancer in children. MCL and CLL are common in adults and remain
incurable diseases. Small molecule inhibitors of kinases downstream of the B-cell receptor (BCR) have
substantially extended survival, although treatment with kinase-inhibitors alone invariably selects for drug-
resistance and relapse. Approximately 1.4 million people in the US are currently living with or recovering from B-
cell malignancies (SEER), highlighting the importance of efforts to reduce toxicity and minimize late effects.
Central tolerance mechanisms sense and eliminate transformed B-cells based on pathological signaling: Normal
antigen encounter results in a short transient pulse of PI3K-activation, slow Ca2+-oscillations, tonic NF-B
activation and positive selection. We discovered two distinctive features of pathological signaling that
initiate central tolerance mechanisms:
  Persistent PI3K-signaling (Aim 1) forces aberrant increases of cell size, causing ATP-depletion (AMPK-
 phosphorylation) and energy crisis.
  High-frequency Ca2+-oscillations (Aim 2) in pathological B-cells are decoded by NFAT instead of NF-
 B, induce NFAT-dependent anergy and cell death.
Here we test the overarching hypothesis that central tolerance mechanisms represent a novel class of
therapeutic targets in B-cell tumors that arise from early B-cell development (B-ALL, CLL and MCL).
Given their B-cell intrinsic activity, targeting of central tolerance mechanisms is expected to have minimal side-
effects."

Mutations in DYRK1A, which encodes a ubiquitously expressed kinase that antagonizes the calcium-
dependent calcineurin (CaN)/NFAT signaling pathway, have been reproducibly linked to neurodevelopmental
disease. DYRK1A loss of function has been associated with syndromic intellectual disability and autism
spectrum disorders (ASD), and increased DYRK1A activity is thought to underlie aspects of Down Syndrome
pathophysiology. These genetic clues underscore DYRK1A dosage-dependent regulation of nervous system
development; however, the precise mechanisms by which DYRK1A executes its roles in the developing brain
remain poorly understood. Our long-term goal is to understand how DYRK1A acts in specific cell types of the
embryonic cerebral cortex to influence the commitment of neural stem and progenitor cells to specific neural
fates. In the proposed studies, we focus on NFAT-dependent transcriptional mechanisms as primary effectors
of DYRK1A activity in neural stem cells and their progeny.
 We have found that deleting Dyrk1a specifically in the developing cortex differentially impacts calcium
signaling in neural stem/progenitor cells and neurons of both the mouse and human. Loss of one or both
copies of Dyrk1a results in dose-dependent cortical thinning, depletion of radial glia stem cells, reduced
astrocyte abundance, neuronal cell death, and shifts in excitatory neuron differentiation. Our previous studies
uncovered similar changes in the generation of excitatory neuron subtypes resulting from the mutation in the
Cav1.2 calcium channel that gives rise to the syndromic ASD Timothy Syndrome. Imbalances in these same
excitatory neuron types have also been linked to neuropsychiatric syndromes and channelopathies, hinting that
calcium-regulated molecular mechanisms may represent a core substrate underlying cellular phenotypes in
ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. In line with this idea, we have found that the effects of Dyrk1a
deletion during cortical development are phenocopied by in vivo modulation of CaN/NFAT signaling, and we
have used CUT&RUN sequencing to begin to identify NFAT transcriptional targets in the developing brain.
Building on these strong published and preliminary findings, the central objective of this proposal is to define
cell type-specific mechanisms by which DYRK1A regulates the development of the cortex. The proposed
research tests the ideas that NFAT transcriptional targets underlie deficits in stem cell maintenance and
differentiation resulting from cortex-specific Dyrk1a inactivation (AIM 1), that DYRK1A and calcium signaling
through CaN/NFAT play key roles in cortical astrogliogenesis (AIM 2), and that cell type-specific NFAT targets
contribute to DYRK1A signaling specificity (AIM 3). These studies will build a foundation for future research
expanding our knowledge of how calcium signaling regulates brain development and how ubiquitously
expressed disease-relevant genes exert specific functions in different cell types. Our results will also provide
therapeutic entry points for convergent intracellular mechanisms driving neurodevelopmental disorders."

Sensitive and accurate measurement of change in cognitive performance is necessary for the detection of
subtle cognitive decline in the preclinical phase of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). It is
also required to evaluate outcomes of early interventions aimed at mitigating advanced cognitive decline.
However, this is a difficult task as these changes are subtle; not only in terms of magnitude, but also in terms
of the latent processes through which they manifest. Although researchers and clinicians are often interested in
detecting long-timescale patterns of change (i.e., normative aging vs. disease progression), learning processes
on short and long-timescales confound such effects.
To address these challenges, we will develop a modern statistical toolset designed for use with data from high-
frequency repeated assessments. For this, we will combine longitudinal measurement “burst” designs with a
novel Bayesian computational toolkit to simultaneously capture multi-timescale learning processes together
with cognitive change and decline. These tools will provide interpretable features (e.g., change in peak
performance, probability of decline, caution in decision making, etc.) that can then be deployed as digital
markers of subtle cognitive decline. The Bayesian approach will also provide for a principled framework to
communicate individual-specific dementia risks towards clinicians.
Our specific aims are to:
1. Separate multi-timescale learning processes from cognitive changes related to aging and
 neurodegeneration and extract key digital cognitive markers to identify digital computational phenotypes of
 ADRD risk.
2. Disentangle cognitive processes in task performance by developing novel statistical tools that quantify
 latent processes to enrich our set of novel digital cognitive markers.
3. Identify which combination of digital cognitive markers and test interval between measurement bursts
 carries the most power for predicting ADRD risk.
For Aim 1 we will analyze two measurement burst design data sets. To further refine the framework in Aims 2
and 3, we develop novel statistical tools and collect data with fine-tuned, novel feature binding tasks known to
be sensitive for preclinical AD. We will evaluate the predictive power of the identified novel digital cognitive
markers by linking them to AD biomarkers levels and ADRD risk scores."

Evidence suggests that cocaine use, notably during critical neurodevelopmental periods like adolescence, is
associated with significant and persistent impairments in cognitive processes like working memory and cognitive
flexibility. Cognitive symptoms are associated with loss of GABAergic inhibitory transmission in the prefrontal
cortex (PFC). Our preliminary data demonstrates that adolescent cocaine exposure induces persistent deficits
in GABAergic somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) in the PFC and cognitive performance in
adulthood. Thus, enhancing cortical inhibition represents a novel therapeutic approach to alleviate cognitive
deficits associated with adolescent cocaine exposure and cocaine use disorder (CUD). This therapeutic goal
may be achieved via activation of the mGlu1 subtype of metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor. Leveraging
highly selective mGlu1 positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), we recently found that mGlu1 positively regulates
cortical inhibition via actions on SST-INs and improves cognitive performance. These findings led us to our
central hypothesis that the ability of mGlu1 PAMs to reverse deficits in cortical inhibition and cognitive impairment
associated with adolescent cocaine exposure is likely driven by actions on mGlu1 receptors located on SST-INs
in the PFC. The present proposal will use cutting-edge transgenic mouse lines and pharmacological tools to
elucidate brain region- and cell type-specific mechanisms underlying mGlu1 regulation of cortical inhibition and
cognitive function and their implications following adolescent cocaine exposure. We will test this hypothesis in
three specific aims.
 Aim 1 (K99): To gain expertise in whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology to test the hypothesis that
mGlu1 regulates PFC inhibitory transmission via actions on SST-INs.
Aim 2 (K99): To develop expertise in in vivo fiber photometry to test the hypothesis that mGlu1-mediated
activation of PFC SST-INs facilitates working memory performance.
Aim 3 (R00): To apply whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology and in vivo fiber photometry to test the
 hypothesis that mGlu1 modulation can ameliorate adolescent cocaine-induced pathophysiology through
 actions on PFC SST-INs.
Together, the proposed studies will expand our current understanding of the critical role of SST-INs in cognitive
processes impaired by adolescent cocaine use and evaluate the therapeutic potential of mGlu1 PAMs in
mitigating these cocaine-induced deficits. I will gain extensive training in whole-cell patch-clamp
electrophysiology and in vivo cell type-specific Ca2+ imaging during touchscreen-based cognitive testing. Training
in these techniques will allow me to apply my interests in behavioral and receptor pharmacology to unanswered
questions about how drug exposure during critical neurodevelopmental periods manifest in physiological and
behavioral consequences of substance use disorders."

The Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN) was established as a mechanism to provide the scientific
community with high-quality human biospecimens for research. The CHTN allows investigators to access the
biospecimens they need to perform cutting-edge research, including basic and early translational cancer
research, and laboratory assay development.
As one of six CHTN Divisions, the Pediatric Division of the CHTN (pCHTN) will receive, process, and distribute
scientifically relevant biospecimens collected from children, adolescents, and young adults. These
biospecimens can include malignant, benign, disease-involved, and uninvolved biospecimens. The pCHTN
seeks to directly promote and support cutting-edge research in the diagnosis, biologic behavior, and treatment
of acute and chronic diseases including cancer by pursuing the following specific aims:
 1. To leverage the relationship with the Children’s Oncology Group , in addition to Nationwide Children’s
 Hospital Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine to procure a wide range of well-annotated
 biospecimens from a variety of both cancerous and non-cancerous conditions, including biospecimens
 from rare tumor types.
 2. To support cutting-edge research by distributing high-quality biospecimens to approved investigators.
 3. To maximize limited biospecimen resources and provide economies of scale by performing additional
 processing of biospecimens (e.g., nucleic acid extraction, tissue microarray creation, digital images of
 stained tissue slides, etc.)
 4. To maintain a reliable and robust Quality Management Program that monitors all aspects of
 biospecimen collection, processing, storage, and distribution in an effort to continuously evaluate and
 improve our operational capabilities, assess best practices, ensure investigator satisfaction, and protect
 the privacy and confidentiality of those individuals from whom the biospecimens and data were
obtained.
 5. To actively contribute to the CHTN by participation and collaboration in Network interactions,
 particularly in fulfilling highly customized or non-standard requests, participating in collaborative
 Network activities, and coordinating or developing new strategies to ensure that the CHTN remains
 responsive to the needs of the scientific community."

Remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a central mechanism by which central nervous system (CNS)
reward substrates, such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc), adapt to unpredictable stressors in the environment.
The ECM is a spatially, molecularly, and cellularly heterogeneous structure that impacts neural activity, cell-cell
interactions, and blood-brain barrier integrity. However, exposure to repeated unpredictable stress leads to
molecular and cellular reorganization of the ECM, which influences circuit-level adaptations to stress guiding
neural activity and behavior. ECM remodeling is partially controlled by integrins: transmembrane receptors that
regulate the ECM by anchoring ECM-associated peptides to multiple cell types. Cellularly, the ECM consists of
neuronal processes and also the endfeet of astrocytes, which are CNS-resident glial cells. Astrocytes make
contacts throughout the ECM by expressing multiple integrins that actively participate in ECM remodeling.
Through these intimate interactions within the ECM, astrocytes are poised to control neural activity and behavior.
However, the mechanisms and cell-cell interactions by which astrocytes shape the NAc ECM in response to
unpredictable stress are largely unknown. In PREVIOUS RESEARCH EFFORTS I focused on characterizing
the responses of astrocyte subsets in the CNS in response to inflammation. I identified the b1 integrin CD29 as
a top marker expressed by astrocytes throughout the CNS. CD29 participates in multiple complexes with other
integrins that affect ECM organization. My previous data suggest that CD29+ astrocytes might be composed of
heterogeneous subsets that play complementary roles in remodeling the ECM by interacting with distinct cell
types. However, it has been historically challenging to rapidly study the interactions of astrocyte subsets in vivo.
To this end, I recently developed a new technique called RABID-seq that profiles astrocyte interactions with other
cells at high throughput, on the genome-wide scale, and with single-cell transcriptomic precision. Thus, RABID-
seq is a candidate tool to define the interactions of CD29+ astrocyte subsets in the ECM in response to
unpredictable stress. In this proposal, I AM PURSUING A NEW RESEARCH DIRECTION to identify how
exposure to unpredictable stress shapes CD29+ astrocyte interactions, localization, and function. I hypothesize
that defined subsets of CD29+ astrocytes regulate distinct ECM domains that influence behavioral responses to
unpredictable stress. I propose to test this hypothesis in the following Specific Aims. In Aim 1, I will define the
interactions of integrin-expressing CD29+ astrocyte subsets within the NAc in response to acute and chronic
unpredictable stress using RABID-seq and CITE-seq. In Aim 2, I will spatially map the ECM domains occupied
by each subset of CD29+ NAc astrocytes via spatial transcriptomics and CD29 cKO mice to uncover how CD29+
astrocytes remodel the ECM in response to stress. In Aim 3, I will define how CD29+ NAc astrocytes regulate
the activity of parvalbumin+ interneurons in a reward-seeking paradigm after exposure to unpredictable stress.
IN SUMMARY, I will study how stress affects the interactions, location, and function of NAc CD29+ astrocytes."

This application is a competitive renewal of the Division of Renal Diseases and Hypertension at the University
of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus T32 Training Program, currently in its 45th year. The program
proposes to train 4 post-doctoral Trainees (MD and PhD) per year. The mission is to train the next generation
of MD and PhD scientists in academic nephrology. To accomplish this objective, the training program requires
the T32 Trainees to have mentored, comprehensive and specialized career development training. Our
program stresses a wide range of science, including basic molecular mechanisms, translational science,
genetics, epidemiology and clinical trials. Each Trainee will undergo an intense 2 to 3 year training program,
including didactic courses, education seminars and career development training. Formal graduate school
training is available through the Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute and Colorado School of
Public Health. Each Trainee is given the choice to pursue his or her research training either in the laboratory
setting or in any Training Faculty Member's clinical research group deemed integral to that Trainee's research
training experience. The laboratories have modern, state-of-the-art equipment and staff that provide the best
possible basic, translational and clinical research environment offered at the University of Colorado Anschutz
Medical Campus. The diverse faculty is expert in a wide range of research topics, including parenchymal and
cystic renal diseases, fluid and electrolyte disorders, acid-base disorders, hypertension, acute and chronic
kidney disease, acute renal replacement therapies, chronic dialysis (peritoneal and hemodialysis, both at home
and in-center), and all aspects of kidney transplantation. There are 31 mentors, of which 45% are women, and
8 emerging mentors from 4 schools and 5 departments. The inclusion of emerging mentors is to provide a
continuum of mentorship and leadership development for the Training Program. For a sustainable workforce,
the Training Program also focuses on academic persistence, resilience and wellness. Between 2009-2019, 25
Trainees completed their training and 60% remain in academic nephrology. In the past 5 years, 100% of our
MD Trainees entered into academic nephrology. Our Trainees have been awarded 10 Career Development
Awards during this time period. Four faculty have recently achieved the ""K to R"" transition over the past 5
years. Our training program is highly committed to the recruitment, training and career success of women and
underrepresented minorities. Overall, 40% of Trainees over the past 10 years were women and 8% came from
underrepresented minorities or disadvantaged backgrounds. All these factors, a history that dates back over
40 years and a strong track record of success enables the Division of Renal Diseases and Hypertension at the
University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to be an ideal site for training future leaders in nephrology."

Structural Basis of APOBEC Functions and HIV Restriction
 Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing Enzyme Catalytic polypeptide (APOBEC) family of cytidine
deaminases are capable of deaminating the cytidine to cause mutation to uridine on DNA or RNA.
Human APOBEC deaminases have remarkable diverse cellular functions through specific targeting
to the intended ssDNA or RNA through a combination of regulations including spatial and temporal
distribution and substrate specificity. For example, APOBEC1 (A1) edits certain RNAs with the help
of specific cofactors to regulate cholesterol metabolism; AID has important role in acquired immune
response, it is required for antibody maturation including somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class
switch recombination (CSR); APOBEC2 (A2) is involved in cardiac and skeletal muscle
development; and APOBEC3 proteins (A3s, A3A-H) plays an important role in innate immunity for
anti-viral activity, they can restrict internal and external nucleic acids (such as RNA and DNA
viruses and retroelements) that poses danger to the genome integrity, which include internal
retroelements as well as external retroviruses and other infectious viral pathogens, such as
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Human Papillomavirus (HPV), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).
Among APOBEC proteins, A3G/A3F/A3D/A3H display strong anti-HIV activity, which are through
deaminase-dependent and -independent mechanisms to inhibit viral replication and infection.
However, retroviruses like HIV-1 can overcome the anti-HIV activity of APOBEC enzymes by its
virus virulent factor (Vif) that specifically recruit cellular Cul5 E3 ligase to target these APOBECs for
ubiquitination and degradation, leading to the viral infection. The deamination activity of APOBECs
can also cause accidental genomic mutations, which can lead to various human diseases such as
immune deficiency and cancer.
 Our long-term scientific goals are to understand the structural/functional relationship for
APOBEC cellular functions and their anti-viral activities. Our specific aims are to understand the
structural basis of APOBEC’s functions and the mechanisms that underlie nucleic acid interactions,
multimerization, functional regulation, and viral restriction, with particular focuses on the double
domain APOBEC3 subfamily members that have strong anti-retroelements and anti-HIV activities.
The outcome of this research will provide valuable information for the fundamental molecular
mechanisms of APOBEC functions and their anti viral activities, which can be used for the potential
drug development to provide therapy for HIV/AIDS, immune disorders, and other diseases such as
cancer."

Exposure to pathogenic viruses that the immune system cannot rapidly clear leads to chronic viral infections.
Cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses against such viruses gradually adopt a epigenetically fixed, hypofunctional
state commonly referred to as T cell exhaustion, which is thought to prevent immunopathological tissue
damage from continuous high-level inflammation driven by antiviral CTL. A similar form of adaptation occurs in
CTL responses against malignant tumors, and leads to increasing immunological tumor tolerance. In both
chronic viral infection and malignancy, antibody blockade of so-called immune checkpoints, including the
inhibitory PD-1 receptor expressed on activated CTL, can often restore exhausted CTL responses. However,
the mechanisms by which this restoration occurs are incompletely understood.
At the single cell level, CTL populations at effector sites of exhausted T cell responses consist of stem-like
memory cells that express the transcription factor TCF-1 as well as TCF-1neg effector-like cells that transiently
acquire full-fledged effector and cytokine-secreting function before eventually adopt a hypofunctional state of
terminal differentiation. It recently emerged that PD-1 blockade does not restore the function of terminally
differentiated cells, but acts primarily on TCF-1pos stem-like cells and causes them to divide, lose TCF-1
expression, and give rise to the highly proliferative transitory effector-like subset that mediates anti-viral or anti-
tumor control.
In prior work for this project we have characterized the critical role of the chemokine receptor CXCR6 to
optimize the interaction of transitory effector-like CTL with a rare activated state of conventional dendritic cells
called DC3, which trans-present IL-15 to CTL to promote their survival and accumulation in tumor tissue. DC3
densely cluster around micro-vessels in the tumor stroma to form perivascular niches, which we suggest may
act as critical gatekeepers for CTL responses at sites of chronic inflammation. We propose to test the
hypothesis that these perivascular niches are also sites for the maintenance of TCF-1pos stem-like CTL in
tumor tissue, and for their conversion into effector-like cells. We will use highly multiplexed histological imaging
of whole tumors and intravital microscopy to identify the chemotactic guidance cues by which TCF-1pos stem-
like CTL are recruited to and retained in these niches and directed to interact with DC3, and we will explore the
mechanism sby which the niches are formed in response to PD-1 blockade."

The overall goal of our NIGMS-funded research program is to identify and characterize the mechanisms that
allow individual sensory neurons to sense and respond to defined environmental cues, and to modulate these
responses based on experience and context. The lab explores these issues in two independent but related
areas. In the first, we study how individual sensory neuron types acquire their specialized sensory cilia
morphologies. In the second, we study how the morphologies and functions of sensory neurons are modulated
by experience. With R35 funding, we have been able to build synergies between these research areas and to
extend our work in unanticipated directions. A first major goal for the upcoming period will be to build on our
work in ciliogenic mechanisms to investigate how the organization of neuronal cilia within a sense organ, as
well as interciliary contacts, contribute to shaping sensory neuron functions. We previously showed that
sensory cilia are stereotypically organized within a head sense organ in C. elegans; the mechanisms that
underlie this organization and the functional consequences of this patterning are unknown. We will determine
whether an adhesion code regulates interciliary contacts and organization, and explore how these contacts
regulate neuronal communication and function. A second major goal will be to investigate how temperature
experience reshapes the complex morphologies of the AFD thermosensory neuron pair in C. elegans. The
architecture of the AFD sensory endings is regulated by neuronal activity and plays a critical role in the ability
of these neurons to adapt and respond to environmental temperature variations. We will exploit our expertise in
neuronal cell biology and high-resolution analyses of sensory behaviors and sensory neuron responses to
describe how the shape of the AFD sensory endings is modified as a function of the animal’s experience, and
how this modification in turn modulates AFD function. A third major goal will be to investigate how the
experience of an analog variable such as temperature is translated into graded gene expression changes in a
single sensory neuron type in vivo, and how these gene expression changes in turn influence neuronal
properties. We plan to establish whether the gene expression pattern in a neuron encodes its temporal activity
history, identify the required regulatory mechanisms, and assess the consequences on neuronal functions. Our
multifaceted experimental approach will allow us to generate a comprehensive description of how activity and
experience intersect with developmental pathways to modify sensory neuron structure and function, thereby
generating appropriate behavioral plasticity. This award will also enable us to continue to train the next
generation of scientists, to establish new collaborations, and to generate and test innovative and novel
hypotheses. Given the conservation of sensory and ciliogenic mechanisms, we expect that findings from this
work will be broadly generalizable, and may provide insights into how altered regulation of neuronal structural
and functional plasticity leads to disease."

The overarching aim of our current funding (NIH Grant # R01 AG063949-01) is to repurpose the Louisville Twin
Study’s original goal of understanding the etiology of child cognitive development into a true lifespan
developmental twin study of cognition, including delineation of the etiology of preclinical symptoms of
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. In the current project period, the third independent aim
encompasses modeling effects of cognitive development on cognitive functioning in midlife, adjusting for
confounding genetic and environmental factors. Throughout the life of the Louisville Twin Study (LTS),
however, recorded ability scores have been age standardized, thus making it impossible to estimate effects of
true intraindividual change in cognitive ability over any period of development. Problems with the age-
standardized approach are compounded by the administration of different tests (e.g., moving from the
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) to the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)) and test
editions (e.g., updating from the WAIS-III to the WAIS-IV) that supposedly measure the same latent cognitive
abilities. Whether they actually do so is an empirical question that has not been addressed previously in any
longitudinal twin study of cognitive ability. All LTS twins’ cognitive ability protocols are available, so individual
items could be used in future analyses. We propose using vertical linking methods that allow the administration
of validated cognitive tasks without requiring age-standardizing cognitive test scores. Child and adult test
content typically is not the same, but there are some items that were administered in childhood that can be
retained in adult tests. For the current data collection, three age-appropriate items from the WISC Block
Design, Similarities, Vocabulary, Arithmetic, and Information subtests will be administered to all returning LTS
adults (projected N = 750). As children, LTS twins completed approximately 10 cognitive ability tests, on
average, half of which were WISC tests. With an estimated five WISC protocols administered to each twin, on
average, there are greater than 73,000 individual subtests to archive and vertically link child and adult
Wechsler ability scores. Item Response Theory models subsequently can be used to place ability scores on
the same scale so that ability trends can be studied and compared across different periods of child and adult
development. Twins’ latent cognitive ability test scores, thus, will be put on the same scale from age 7 through
midlife. Our efforts in the LTS are the first of its kind in longitudinal twin studies of cognitive ability. By linking
childhood cognitive tests to adult tests, we will increase the significance and innovation of our findings by
specifying the lifespan growth functions of ability at the subtest and latent factor levels to model individual
twins’ true intraindividual cognitive ability trajectories."
10885356,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Expanded GGGGCC (G4C2) hexanucleotide repeats in the C9orf72 gene were recently identified as the most
common genetic cause of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), two
neurodegenerative disorders with genetic and pathological overlap. Despite being located in a non-coding region
of the gene, expanded G4C2 repeats can promote translation in both the sense and antisense direction to produce
five different aggregating dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) which are thought to play a key role in c9ALS/FTD
pathogenesis. Translation across the expanded repeats has been proposed to be mediated primarily by two, not
necessarily mutually exclusive, non-canonical translation mechanisms: repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN)
translation and/or ribosomal initiation at an upstream near-cognate CUG codon.
 Recently, we have demonstrated that DPRs are produced in a second, hexanucleotide repeat expansion
disorder, spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36). Given the genetic similarity between the TG3C2 and G4C2
repeats underlying SCA36 and c9ALS/FTD, respectively, poly(GP) and poly(PR) DPRs are produced in both
disorders. However, poly(GP) DPRs in SCA36 are soluble species and do not form the characteristic cytoplasmic
inclusions seen in c9ALS/FTD suggesting that aggregation of the intrinsically soluble poly(GP) species is
mediated through an alternate mechanism in c9ALS/FTD. It has generally been accepted that independent
translational events with unique open reading frames give rise to individual, homogenous DPR species.
However, a growing body of evidence suggests that frameshifting events, either through ribosomal frameshifting
or frameshifting indels, can occur across expanded repeat sequences, thereby expanding the possibility of
complex DPR species. Indeed, data from our group show that heterogenous chimeric DPR proteins (cDPRs),
composed of aggregate prone poly(GA) and poly(GP) or poly(GR) are detectable in c9ALS/FTD patient tissue.
 These cDPR species alter the localization and solubility of homogenous DPR species. However, to what
extent these chimeric DPRs (cDPRs) contribute to disease pathogenesis is unknown. Based on our preliminary
findings, it is our central hypothesis that cDPRs are detectable throughout the central nervous system (CNS)
and that cDPRs can modify the toxicity of homogenous DPR species. To test this hypothesis, we will 1) identify
complexity, extent, and mechanism of cDPR pathology in c9ALS/FTD, 2) identify the molecular consequences
and neuronal toxicity of poly(GA:GR) cDPRs in vitro and in vivo , and 3) develop a novel GA:GR cDPR mouse
that more faithfully recapitulates human pathology. Results from this proposal will expand our understanding of
DPR biology and provide new insight into the cellular cascades that cause neurodegeneration in c9ALS/FTD."

Contemporary estimates suggest that more than 40% of people living with chronic HIV-1 infection (PLWH) have
diastolic heart failure (dHF), a harbinger for adverse clinical outcomes including pulmonary abnormalities,
frequent hospitalizations, and sudden death. To date, the molecular causes for dHF in PLWH remain poorly
understood. This paucity of information and a lack of treatment options have prompted the OAR to list “Strategies
to Prevent and Treat HIV-Associated Heart Diseases” as areas of high priority for HIV research. We hypothesize
that that “elevation of the cytotoxic glycolysis metabolite, methylglyoxal (MG) is a primary cause for dHF
development in PLWH.” This elevation in MG is arising from HIV-1 induce upregulation of glycolysis in infected
immunocytes followed by ischemia-induced increase in glycolysis in vascular cells and cardiac myocytes. This
multi-PI project brings together the expertise of Drs. Keshore R. Bidasee (M-PI, heart failure) and Santhi Gorantla
(M-PI, humanized mice and HIV-1 infection) with assistance from Dr. Prasanta Dash (HIV-1 eradication and
cardiovascular complications), to (1) Define pathobiological trajectories of dHF in relation to MG levels in HIV-1
infected Hu-mice with and with ARD treatment; (2) Characterize mechanisms by which MG increases in HIV-I
infected immunocytes and in myocytes, macrophages and vascular cells under with and without ARD and
hypoxia (3) Show that lowering MG will blunt dHF in HIV-infected Hu-mice with and without ARD.
Accomplishments of these aims will not only define a novel link between glycolysis and early-onset dHF in the
setting of HIV-1 infection, but the data could pave the way for the development of urgently needed therapeutics
to mitigate this disease in PLWH."

 2 Coronary artery calcium (CAC), typically measured on gated computed tomography (CT) scans, is the
 3 strongest predictor of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events across all populations, including
 4 groups underrepresented using traditional risk assessment methods. Despite the predictive ability of CAC
 5 imaging, less than 1 million gated CT scans are performed annually in the US vs 19 million non-gated chest CTs
 6 performed for reasons other than to measure CAC. Further, underrepresented individuals undergo fewer gated
 7 CAC scans because these scans are not typically covered by insurance. When scored manually, non-gated CAC
 8 scores predict ASCVD events as accurately as gated CAC scores, but grading CAC severity by visual estimation
9 is qualitative and inconsistent, and reporting varies substantially. Consequently, there is vital, lifesaving
10 information that has been collected but not used to guide preventive interventions for individuals unaware of their
11 increased ASCVD risk.
12 Stanford has developed a deep learning (DL) algorithm that quantifies CAC Agatston scores accurately on
13 routine non-gated chest CTs. We have shown that notifying patients and their clinicians about the presence of
14 incidental CAC dramatically increases statin prescriptions. The Novel Incidental Calcium Evaluation (NICE)
15 study will apply the now FDA-cleared algorithm on non-gated chest CTs performed across 3 geographically
16 diverse health systems (Stanford, MedStar Health, and Mayo Clinic). The study will include ~186,000 diverse
17 patients with non-gated chest CT scans without known ASCVD and follow-up within the 3 health systems.
18 Our team has expertise in preventive cardiology, radiology, epidemiology, health equity, DL, and qualitative
19 methods. First, the NICE study will evaluate the prevalence, epidemiology, and prognostic value of DL-CAC in
20 predicting ASCVD events across a real-world, diverse primary prevention cohort who underwent non-gated chest
21 CTs (Aim 1). Second, the algorithm will be extended to estimate CAC on lung cancer screening low radiation
22 dose CT scans (Aim 2). Automating CAC quantification would allow for the equitable and efficient implementation
23 of joint lung cancer and ASCVD screening programs for the 14.5 million eligible individuals in the US. Third, in
24 partnership with the National Minority Health Alliance, we will conduct focus groups with 100 diverse patient and
25 clinician stakeholders to identify facilitators and barriers to increasing preventive therapies following notification
26 of DL-CAC (Aim 3).
27 NICE will provide compelling evidence to support the immediate implementation of opportunistic screening for
28 and notification of CAC by leveraging routine, non-gated chest CTs already performed for other reasons. This
29 study fulfills the promise of data science approaches to equitably improve cardiovascular disease prevention."

Materials for applications in healthcare and medicine usually come from two main groups (a) synthetic polymers
specifically designed to achieve a certain goal or (b) naturally derived biopolymers that are leveraged in their
native or slightly modified state for a specific goal. The advantage of being a synthetic chemist is that technically,
if you can synthesize it, the possibilities are infinite, but the downfall is that often solvents or portions of the
polymer cause cytocompability issues or concerns when it comes to translation and implantation in a human.
Alternatively, unmodified natural biopolymers, or proteins, have an easier path toward Food and Drug
Administration's approval, but lack the customizability afforded in synthesis or chemical modification. Genetic
engineering via production of small peptides in bacteria has improved the availability of customizable short
peptides, but proteins on the order of hundreds of kilodaltons cannot be produced this way. This is the case for
the silk fibroin biopolymers isolated from caterpillars in the Lepidoptera order, where the heavy chain of silk
fibroin is known to be over 300 kilodaltons in length. Genetic engineering, using tools such as CRISPR or
PiggyBac, provides an avenue for theoretically modifying the sequence of silk proteins, which has been
attempted with limited success in the domesticated silkworm, Bombyx mori. However, silk is collected from the
cocoon of the B. mori pupae, meaning that the life cycle of this silkworm is interrupted, making it difficult to
maintain these modified populations or assess phenotypes in a high-throughput manner. To address this, silk
fibroin will be isolated from an entirely different silk-producing species: Plodia interpunctella, or the Indianmeal
moth. Under specific conditions, this agricultural pest produces sheets of silk prior to entering the cocooning
phase. These easily collectable sheets of silk fibers can then be cleaned, degummed, and regenerated to an
aqueous biopolymer solution. Moreover, unlike B. mori, P. interpunctella silk collection does not interrupt the life
cycle of the silkworm/moth and these silkworms are easier to stably genetically modify though embryo injections
compared to B. mori. In this Maximizing Investigators' Research Award, genetic engineering will be leveraged to
modify the silk fibroin protein sequence at the organismal level, adding in new peptide sequences such as
mammalian cell binding motifs or sites for human growth factor sequestration. Scale-up of the process will be
achieved via transcriptional regulation of silk fibroin as a function of external stimuli such as humidity or
pathogens. Together, these two strategies for enhancing the bio-functionality of the silk fibroin protein and the
scale-up required for advanced manufacturing of medical devices or materials will be explored. The outcomes
of this work include full biophysical, biochemical, and in vivo characterization of these materials through analysis
of systemic and local immune responses in vivo, complete characterization of the new biopolymer structures,
and investigation of mechanotransduction in these materials in vitro. Future work aims to leverage this new class
of biopolymers for specific applications in pharmaceutical delivery, tissue engineering, and muscle rehabilitation."

The notion that the positions of chromosomal loci within the interphase nucleus are not static, but move, is not
new. However, the mechanistic role of the chromatin motion is usually underestimated. In fact, the nanoscale
motion of chromatin may modulate the interaction of DNA with regulatory molecules, including chromatin
effectors, transcription factors and non-coding RNAs, thus impacting the global patterns of gene expression.
Unfortunately, experimental evidence supporting an essential role of chromatin motion in these activities is
sparse. Thus, it is unclear if changes in chromatin dynamics facilitate these biological processes or are simply
consequences.
The goal of this project is to quantify the chromatin motion throughout the mammalian nucleus and to explore
its mechanistic role in genome functions. To this end, the proposed research combines multidisciplinary
approaches to concentrate on the link of chromatin motion with epigenetic regulation, DNA damage, and
transcription, with the ultimate goal to understand the causality from epigenetic modification to phenotypic gene
expression. The proposed projects are listed as below,
Project 1 Map the chromatin motion in 3D with nanometer resolution. We will heavily incorporate the data
science approach into our innovative imaging system to optimize the toolbox of measuring the chromatin. The
toolbox will include the data-driven 3D imaging system and data science supported image informatics software.
Project 2 Investigate the link between chromatin motion and epigenetic modification and transcription.
We will explore the reciprocal interactions between chromatin motion and epigenetic modifications as well as
transcription, respectively. These experimental investigations can feed proper mathematical models, therefore
to formalize the reaction network in chromatin remodeling and gene expression.
Results generated from these projects have great potential to reveal fundamental links between chromatin
motion and gene expression, which will transform our understanding of disease mechanism and facilitate the
development of therapeutic intervention."

Latinxs, particularly those with mental illness, are at higher risk of COVID-19 infection, and associated morbidity
and mortality, and yet have lower rates of vaccination, than non-Latinx whites. This pattern is not unique to
COVID-19; it has been observed for other infectious diseases, including seasonal influenza. Vaccine hesitancy,

roadblock for COVID-19 and influenza vaccination among Latinxs. Theoretical frameworks endorsed by the
SAGE working group on vaccine hesitancy, and prior research, illustrate that interventions to reduce vaccine
hesitancy and increase vaccine uptake in Latinxs should adopt strategies that: increase vaccine confidence and
convenience; reduce vaccine complacency; and respond to contextual, individual and vaccine-related factors
driving hesitancy, which include but are not limited to the social determinants of health and structural racism.
While a variety of strategies have been developed to address vaccine hesitancy in priority populations, the
potential role of behavioral health in community-based integrated health care settings has been overlooked. Yet
behavioral health, particularly within federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) which target social determinants
of health, may be an ideal setting to reach Latinxs, and other priority populations with mental illness, to address
vaccine hesitancy and promote vaccine uptake. In collaboration with East Boston Neighborhood Health Center
(EBNHC), the largest FQHC of Massachusetts, the proposed study will evaluate a novel Motivational
Interviewing (MI) behavioral intervention to reduce vaccine hesitancy and increase COVID-19 and influenza
vaccine uptake in Latinx adults with mental illness. Key to the intervention is that the proposed MI protocol
explicitly acknowledges cultural values that are central to the Latinx population and that impact their interactions
with health care providers. Additionally, the intervention has been specifically designed to be feasible and readily
implemented in community-based settings, and to be sustainable in the long-term regardless of how the rapidly
changing COVID-19 vaccination landscape evolves. To rigorously evaluate the intervention, we will conduct a
pragmatic multiple-period cluster-randomized crossover trial within four BH programs at EBNHC; key to this
design is that each program serves as its own control and that the multiple switches enhance statistical power.
To our knowledge, this will be the first study to rigorously examine the potential role of BH providers in increasing
vaccine uptake among Latinx adults with mental illness, a particularly vulnerable population. Key to the
anticipated impact is the partnership between the academia-based research team and colleagues at EBNHC
which, in turn, will support the rapid translation of evidence into practice together with a model for sustainable
collaboration and national scaleup."

Social determinants, including those related to food and housing, have a powerful impact on health, but there
is uncertainty on how to best leverage policy to improve individuals’ social circumstances and related health
outcomes. Presently, 11% of Americans have food insecurity, including 35% of families with incomes below the
federal poverty line, and rates of food insecurity have increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic.
A growing literature finds associations between food security and mental health, positing a bi-directional
relationship, wherein food insecurity increases stress and anxiety leading to poorer mental health, and serious
mental illness impairs consistent access to food. Improving food security may be critical to improving mental
health in low-income populations, particularly with COVID-19, but opportunities to examine the causal impact
of such an intervention are rare. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has been shown to
be effective in reducing, but not eliminating, food insecurity for low-income households. Many families on
SNAP have residual food insecurity due to early exhaustion of SNAP benefits. Many policy experts believe that
an increased investment in SNAP would both enhance the capacity of recipients to purchase healthy food and
smooth the consumption of their benefits, potentially improving health outcomes. But this hypothesis has not
been rigorously tested to date. During the pandemic, the federal government took unprecedented steps to
increase SNAP benefits to low-income families. In January 2021, SNAP household budgets were increased by
15%, leading to an increase in federal SNAP benefits of about $40 per month on average. We leverage this
natural experiment to examine whether increased food security from the SNAP changes reduced mental illness
during the pandemic. We will thereby elucidate the causal relationship between food security and mental
health, and their links to healthcare utilization. Finally, we will assess changes in the rate of benefit spending to
inform the broader design of SNAP policy to optimize health outcomes. Our specific Aims are to a) assess
whether increased SNAP budget allotments was associated with changes in indicators of mental health during
the COVID-19 pandemic, b) examine the effect of an increase in SNAP budget allotment on the use of, and
adherence to, recommended care services, and rates of adverse outcomes and health care costs among low-
income individuals with previously diagnosed conditions, and c) estimate whether an increase in SNAP budget
allotments impacted patterns of SNAP monthly benefit use. To answer these first-order policy questions, we
use a data from a novel, linked panel dataset that spans the COVID-19 pandemic and includes administrative
Medicaid claims, administrative claims from the SNAP program, and data on the weekly use of SNAP benefits
for beneficiaries. Our team is well-positioned to examine the understudied link between food insecurity and
mental health and to assess the related public health, clinical, and policy implications."
10876485,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The last two decades have seen extraordinary advances in the cost, accessibility, and interpretability of
genetic testing. In the context of this astonishing progress, it is striking that for many rare genetic diseases,
diagnostic delay – the time between onset of symptoms and a diagnosis – has not improved. Current health
care services are unable to effectively identify patients that would benefit most from genetic testing. As a result,
many patients affected by genetic disease are not diagnosed for years after symptoms develop, or are never
diagnosed at all, leading to costly diagnostic odysseys, health care disparities in genetic services, and
preventable morbidity and mortality for those with conditions that have an effective, targeted treatment.
 Much of what we know about genetic disease is based on studies of individuals and their families. This
has proven to be a powerful method for discerning the clinical characteristics of genetic disease, generating
one of the most enduring and useful resources in medical genetics: the online Mendelian inheritance in man
(OMIM). However, clinical descriptions in OMIM do not always match the way diseases are described in real-
world EHR data. To improve our ability to use genetic testing effectively, we can learn, at scale, from the data
clinically captured while testing and diagnosing patients. EHRs provides an opportunity to study genetic
disease from a new perspective, enabling scalable methods that augment existing the knowledge base to
include phenotypes observed in real-world health care data.
 This proposal builds on our prior work curating genetic testing data from the EHR and developing tools
to identify undiagnosed patients from characteristic genetic disease profiles. Specifically, we have built a
database of clinical genetic testing information extracted from the EHR for over 20,000 individuals, with
detailed information regarding test results, variant interpretation, and diagnosis. From this resource, we can
define EHR-based cases series of individuals with genetically-confirmed clinical diagnoses of genetic disease.
We will use a data-driven approach to discern characteristic phenotypes from the EHR-based case series, and
merge these results with clinical descriptions from OMIM. This approach seeks to translate the curated,
durable knowledge cataloged in OMIM to a portable and scalable product that can layered on any set of EHRs
to identify undiagnosed patients with genetic disease.
 The ultimate goals of this proposal are leverage these data and tools to 1) translate and add to clinical
curations of genetic diseases using real world EHR data, 2) assess diagnostic yield of EHR-based tools that
identify undiagnosed patients and 3) characterize the contribution of demographic and phenotypic features that
lead to earlier or later diagnosis."
10876488,"Abstract: Usher syndrome (USH) is the most common form of inherited deaf-blindness, with a prevalence of 1/6.000.
Inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, it affects about 15,000 people in the United States and is responsible for 6% of
early childhood deafness. Usher syndrome is classified under three clinical subtypes (USH-1, -2 and -3) according to the
severity of the symptoms. Approximately 2/3 of the patients with USH suffer from USH2 and USH1, of whom 75% have
mutations in the USH2A, USH1D and 1F genes. Because USH affects both major senses, it is a severely debilitating
condition, and intense research is crucial to improve coping strategies and develop therapies for the patients. It is particularly
devastating during the current pandemic, with social distancing and the wearing of masks making communication nearly
impossible. Treatment for USH is limited to cochlear implants, and there is no treatment for the blindness. Development of
an effective therapeutic approach for USH has been challenging due to the large size of USH genes. Therefore, there is an
unmet need to develop alternative therapeutic strategies. The goal of this project is to develop and test novel therapy
approaches for treating recessive deafness in human hair cells of inner ear organoids derived from human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and in USH mouse models by establishing genome editing-based therapeutic strategies for
USH and to lay the foundation for moving genome editing approaches closer clinical trials. We have chosen to focus on
the most common mutations in the three major USH genes with the following reasons: 1) The USH2A, 1D, and 1F genes
are the most common and important USH genes which are responsible for more than 70% human USH cases with significant
clinical application; 2) Due to their large size, traditional gene augmentation or addition therapy is hampered as its coding
sequence far exceeds the packaging capacity of standard gene therapy vectors; 3) All three USH2A, 1D, and 1F genes
contain similar multiple repetitive domains with in frame common mutations in their protein structures, making them
potential targets for exon-skipping-based therapies (see Preliminary data); 4) We have obtained exciting data demonstrating
restoration of hearing in an Ush2a mouse model using exon skipping strategy with an available mouse model of USH2A
and have successfully generated hiPSCs from Usher patients carrying the most common mutations of USH, and established
optimized protocols for generation of large numbers of human inner ear organoids with the production of human hair cells
derived from these hiPSCs. This proposal leverages the exceptional deafness genomics information and genome editing
expertise of collaborators for the development of novel treatments for HL. In this proposal, we will build on our
accomplishments and preliminary data by proposing to complete the following specific aims: 1) to develop CRISPR/Cas9-
based exon-skipping strategies to rescue hearing in transgenic USH mouse models and 2) to develop exon-skipping by
CRISPR/Cas9 editing strategies to rescue USH mutations using inner ear organoids derived from patient hiPSCs. This
proposal develops a new strategy utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 editing to skip exons most afflicted by common recessive
mutations in USH2A, USH1D and USH1F as treatment to rescue hearing in animal models and restore phenotypes in human
patient iPS cells-derived inner ear organoids with the hope of moving these technologies closer to their clinical application."

Syndromic disorders account for a large proportion of the rare genetic disorders that impact the pediatric
population, including many conditions with structural birth defects and other congenital anomalies. These
conditions are a disproportionate cause of morbidity and mortality. Accurate molecular diagnosis is important for
medical management, family planning, and engagement in research studies. Next generation sequencing has
driven the pace of discovery of novel genetic syndromes, yet there are marked inconsistencies in the level of
evidence for gene-disease relationships (GDRs) that complicate the application of genetic testing. We have
formed the Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel (SD-GCEP), an international group of disease
experts, gene curation framework experts, and biocurators representing 23 institutions across 5 continents to
thoroughly curate the evidence supporting the relationship of a gene in causing a disease, and to quantify the
strength of that evidence using the framework developed by the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen). The SD-
GCEP consists of representatives from major stakeholders including Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(OMIM), Monarch Initiative’s Mondo disease ontology, Genomics England PanelApp, PanelApp Australia,
Centers for Mendelian Genomics, diagnostic laboratories (Ambry, Illumina, Invitae), practicing clinical
geneticists, genetic counselors, and rare disease and model organism researchers. In Aim 1, we will perform 68
GDR precurations, curations and recurations representing the most commonly tested syndromic disorders not
within the purview of other GCEPs, which generally focus on a specific organ or pathway. In Aim 2, we will
perform 89 precurations, curations, and recurations for syndromic GDRs identified through clinical exome and
genome sequencing performed by diagnostic laboratories with personnel involved in the SD-GCEP. In Aim 3A,
we will perform 24 precurations, curations, and recurations for newly discovered syndromic GDRs from the
Centers for Mendelian Genomics, as these are of high interest to diagnostic laboratories to determine when
genes should be added to panels and to clinicians to guide clinical diagnosis and management. The SD-GCEP
is highly experienced and collaborative. In Aim 3B, we will continue to accept requests from other GCEPs to
curate 15 GDRs of interest that are beyond the scope of the other GCEP due to the syndromic nature of the
condition. In total, we will perform 196 precurations, curations, and recurations of GDRs for syndromic disorders
over three years. All curations will be performed using the ClinGen Gene Curation Interface and publicly shared
though the ClinGen knowledgebase to improve genetic testing and diagnosis for syndromic disorders and to
highlight where further research is needed."

Neurodegenerative diseases cause a progressive loss of neuronal function. Currently, an estimated 6
million Americans are live with dementia. Diagnosis often happens after symptoms start and irreversible
damage has already occurred. Patients face a bleak prognosis, as treatments are ineffective at halting
disease progression. Better treatments will rely on earlier diagnosis and drugs that stop progressive
degeneration. To identify biomarkers and promising drug targets, we need to understand the cellular and
molecular mechanisms underlying degenerative processes. Tau protein aggregation is a hallmark of
several neurodegenerative diseases and is highly correlated with symptoms. Tau is known to bind and
regulate microtubule stability. Several post-translational modifications of Tau have been documented,
though the significance on symptom severity is unclear. It is critical that we identify the signaling
downstream of Tau to find novel targets. To address our overall objective, we are using genetics to reveal
a novel role for the highly conserved RPM-1 signaling network in degeneration in a C. elegans tauopathy
model. RPM-1 is a key regulator of neural development, but recent work shows roles for RPM-1 orthologs
in axon degeneration following injury. RPM-1 also promotes synapse maintenance and, importantly, was
shown to be genetically inhibited by ptl-1/Tau during development. Our rationale is that genetic analysis
will identify a new signaling network with Tau in neurodegeneration and how this network influences
different stages of neurodegeneration. Completion of Aim 1 will reveal the Tau and RPM-1 genetic
network in neurodegeneration. Aim 2 will yield a comprehensive time course analysis of synaptic,
mitochondrial, and microtubule dynamics changes that occur from development through late stage
degeneration. We will also assess how the network identified in Aim 1 affects these cellular changes at
key time points. The innovation of this proposal is the novel Tau network that includes the RPM-1
pathway. Additionally, time-course analysis of subcellular changes will provide a timeline of key
phenomena directly correlating with degeneration. We also will microtubule dynamics, which is not widely
done and has never been done in vivo in a tauopathy model. This proposed research is significant
because it will provide new insights into the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying
neurodegeneration, as well as potential targets for future drug development. Importantly, this proposal will
satisfy key objective of the R15 mechanism by 1) significantly enhancing exposure of students to
molecular biology research and 2) strengthening the research infrastructure at the Florida Institute of
Technology."
10875313,"Project Summary/Abstract: Tuberculosis and related mycobacterial diseases are challenging to treat in part
due to the extraordinary tolerance of mycobacteria to drugs. Despite the identification of trehalose metabolism
as a key contributor to mycobacterial drug tolerance and a promising target for therapeutic development, there
has been limited progress toward elucidating the roles of trehalose metabolic pathways in mycobacterial
physiology and pathogenesis, and in exploiting these pathways for applications in basic and translational
research. As established in the prior periods of this award, trehalose analogues can serve as powerful tools to
drive progress in these areas. However, the challenges associated with the synthesis of trehalose analogues
has severely impeded their development and applications. The long-term goal of the research is to better
understand and target mycobacterial trehalose metabolism. The objectives of this project are to harness
chemoenzymatic synthesis to develop trehalose analogues as tools for mycobacteria research, with a focus in
the next period on novel tools to investigate and address mycobacterial drug tolerance. These objectives will be
achieved through three specific aims, each of which employs chemoenzymatic synthesis methods: (Aim 1)
Develop trehalose analogues as trehalose metabolism modulators; (Aim 2) Develop trehalose monomycolate
(TMM) analogues as cell envelope permeability modulators; and (Aim 3) Develop trehalose analogues as
immune modulators. In Aim 1, the TreT catalysis method for trehalose analogue synthesis developed in the prior
periods will be improved in reaction scope and scale and applied toward the synthesis and characterization of
trehalose-based inhibitors of TreS-mediated metabolic remodeling in mycobacteria. In Aim 2, chemoenzymatic
methods will be used to synthesize trehalose monomycolate analogues as tools for studying and impairing cell
envelope permeability toward drugs in mycobacteria. In Aim 3, chemoenzymatic synthesis will aid the
development of trehalose-based antibody-recruiting molecules and strategies, which will be investigated for their
ability to augment the host immune response to mycobacteria. This application is innovative because: (i) instead
of traditional chemical synthesis, chemoenzymatic methods will be used to substantially increase the diversity,
functionality, and accessibility of trehalose analogues for mycobacteria research; (ii) while trehalose analogues
have been applied extensively in imaging applications, this project will shift focus to developing novel tools for
studying and addressing the problem of mycobacterial drug tolerance. This research is significant because it will
produce new synthetic methods, tool compounds, and strategies to investigate and target trehalose metabolism,
which is critical to growth, virulence, and drug tolerance in numerous mycobacterial pathogens. This project will
continue to support the interdisciplinary training of undergraduate students in a biomedical research area of high
importance, and it will enhance the institutions’ research environments, in part through continued development
and utilization of a biocontainment facility for research on pathogenic mycobacteria."

Aging research studies are increasingly multidisciplinary in nature with longitudinal study design and
extensive data collection including genomic, multi-omics, and large electronic medical records data in
addition to traditional clinical data. These increased complexities in study design and data dimensionality
present special challenges to aging researchers in data analyses and result interpretation for meaningful
and reproducible scientific discoveries. I have conducted independent statistical research and have also
collaborated extensively with investigators in aging research during my two-decades career at Indiana
University School of Medicine. I have also mentored junior investigators on K-applications and directed
Ph.D. students in research focused on statistical methods in aging research. The Academic Leadership
Award will provide support for developing a comprehensive statistical training program that includes
advanced statistical methods tailored to physicians and scientists in aging research and illustrated using
case studies from aging research projects. The first aim is to develop an Advanced Statistical Methods in
Aging Research curriculum that will provide comprehensive, in-depth training of modern statistical
methods applicable to aging research. The second aim is to enhance research capacity at Indiana
University by providing data resources and analytical tools from completed and ongoing aging studies to
support secondary data analyses and pilot projects. The third aim is to provide individual mentoring to
junior investigators for obtaining career development awards. A comprehensive, robust and advanced
statistical training program will lead to better study design, increased research productivity, higher
research quality and reproducible scientific discoveries in aging research."
10877888,"Project Summary/Abstract
Postpartum depressive (PPD) symptoms are common among women following the birth of a child and can
adversely impact a mother's ability to care for her child. As a result, infants of mothers with PPD symptoms
may experience less responsive parenting, placing them at greater risk for delays in development. Evidence-
based parenting programs have been developed to guide mothers with caring for their infants but may not
address the impact of depression on parenting, are intensive and expensive to administer with limited ability for
scale up, or are not available in a format that facilitates participation by women with depressive symptoms.
Therefore, these women may not be able to take advantage of the benefits of parenting programs. Our long-
term goal is to develop effective parenting strategies to facilitate optimal child development for mothers
suffering with PPD symptoms. Our overall objective for this application is to study whether this program
combined with online depression treatment leads to more responsive parenting (target) and signals improved
child language, socioemotional and cognitive development (outcomes) compared to depression treatment
alone. The specific aims are 1) to determine whether a social media-based parenting program can improve
responsive parenting (target) among mothers with PPD symptoms, 2) to determine whether a social media-
based parenting program can improve responsive parenting (target) and signal greater child development
(outcome) among mothers with PPD symptoms, and 3) to explore mediators and moderators of the effects of
the parenting program on responsive parenting. The proposed study will occur at 3-4 primary care practices
affiliated with a large urban children's hospital and consist of 2 phases: an initial pilot RCT testing engagement
of the parenting program on responsive parenting (R61) and a subsequent RCT further testing engagement of
the program and exploring child development and mediators and moderators of treatment effect (R33). In the
first phase, 75 ethnically and racially diverse women who screen positive for PPD symptoms and have infants
<6 months of age will be randomized to receive the parenting program plus online depression treatment or
online depression treatment alone to assess target engagement. In the second phase, an additional 75 eligible
women will be randomized to receive the parenting program plus online depression treatment or depression
treatment alone. In this latter phase, we will further determine whether the parenting program effectively
engages the proposed target, responsive parenting, and signals greater child developmental status than the
online depression treatment program. In addition, we will explore mediators and moderators of treatment
effects on responsive parenting. The results of this application would be expected to contribute important new
knowledge and inform a future trial on parenting strategies to better assist mothers with PPD symptoms and
improve child developmental outcomes."

 Currently, obesity afflicts almost 40% of adult Americans, predisposing these people to diabetes and
other diseases that reduce their quality of life and longevity and costing the US health care system over $150
billion/year. Unfortunately, our incomplete understanding of the processes that control energy balance
continues to impede the design of new medical therapies to prevent and treat obesity.
 Leptin acts via its receptor (LepRb) on specialized hypothalamic neurons to control food intake, energy
expenditure, and other aspects of energy balance-related neuroendocrine function and behavior.
Understanding how leptin modulates LepRb neurons and how these neurons control energy balance (thereby
identifying processes that may be targeted for the therapy of obesity) represent the long-term goals of our
previous and proposed studies under this project (DK056731). In addition to our other work under this award,
we determined roles in energy balance and metabolism for specific groups of LepRb neurons, revealing the
importance of previously unidentified sets of LepRb neurons. We therefor used single-nucleus RNA-seq
(snRNA-seq) and unbiased clustering to identify transcriptionally-defined groups of hypothalamic LepRb
neurons (LepRb populations). This analysis identified previously-described (e.g., LepRbAgRP and LepRbPOMC)
and novel (e.g., LepRbGlp1r and LepRbPirt) LepRb populations.
 Using new molecular tools that we have developed, we now propose to study several novel LepRb T-
types, including DMH LepRbGlp1r neurons and ARC LepRbPirt cells. We hypothesize that leptin activates
GABAergic LepRbGlp1r neurons, inhibiting downstream ARC AgRP cells to restrain food intake and body
weight. We also postulate that leptin inhibits GABAergic LepRbPirt cells to activate specific endocrine axes.
We propose to: Aim 1. Understand the regulation of individual LepRb populations; Aim 2. Determine the
downstream targets and effects of individual LepRb populations; and Aim 3. Define physiologic roles for
individual LepRb populations, including in leptin action.
 In addition to providing insight into the neural circuits and processes that modulate the control of food
intake, energy expenditure, and neuroendocrine function, these studies may identify novel targets for
therapeutic intervention in obesity and other metabolic diseases."

The molecular regulation of body shape and size during development and regeneration involves
numerous pathways precisely integrated together with the biophysical properties of cellular and
tissue dynamics, a complex process poorly understood at the level of whole animals. The overall
goal of this project is to gain a mechanistic understanding of the genetic regulation and
coordination of large-scale tissue growth by developing and applying a novel integrated systems
biology approach. Combining in vivo experiments and their morphological formalization with
machine learning of mathematical biophysical models, we will discern the molecular mechanisms
that control growth, shape, and size regulation. We will leverage the robustness of the planarian
worm to address the molecular and physical mechanisms regulating their extraordinary
homeostatic and regenerative capacity to grow, degrow, and regenerate their whole-body shapes
and organs from almost any amputation and across one order of magnitude in sizes.
This work will develop novel computational systems biology methods and integrate them with
whole-body gene expression imaging and surgical and genetic manipulations assays to elucidate
the molecular regulators of body shape and size. Morphological, genetic, and surgical data will
be formalized with novel mathematical ontologies, which will serve as input to new machine
learning methods able to infer mechanistic gene regulatory networks. The regulatory networks
will be quantitatively modeled with a novel mathematical continuous approach for whole-body
biophysical simulation, including tissue growth, adhesion molecules, and gene regulation. This
computational framework combining machine learning with biophysical modeling will be able to
discover the mechanisms of growth and shape regulation from large formalized experimental
datasets. Novel genetic interactions will be discovered by the machine learning methodology,
which predictions in terms of morphological and gene expression outcomes resulting from genetic
and surgical manipulations will be validated at the bench via RNAi and in situ hybridization assays.
Integrating machine learning, biophysical mathematical modeling, ontological formalizations, and
in vivo surgical and molecular assays represents a comprehensive systems biology approach for
elucidating the regulation of shape and size. This work will provide a mechanistic understanding
of the diverse genetic pathways that regulate tissue growth dynamics and how they interact
precisely between them and with tissue biophysics to create and maintain whole-body scale
targeted shapes and sizes. This work will pave the way for new applications and novel therapies
in human developmental, regenerative, and cancer medicine."
10877988,"Mutations of the p53 gene are found in the majority of lung cancers and most of these mutations are single
amino acid changes instilling gain-of-function (GOF) oncogenic phenotypes, making the GOF p53 oncoprotein
an excellent cancer therapeutic target. We propose a radically different approach to current GOF p53 targeting
therapeutic concepts in which instead of inhibiting the protein, we weaponize GOF p53 in promoting lung cancer
cell death, either by suicide, viral lysis, or both, while leaving normal cells unscathed. This innovative strategy
is possible based on our discovery of a unique transactivation mechanism for GOF p53, and from that, our
creation of a GOF p53 inducible promoter. Our GOF p53 inducible promoter directs expression of any gene
cloned downstream only if the cell has a GOF p53 mutation, with wild-type (WT) p53 having no effect on the
promoter and cells with WT p53 or p53 null mutations showing no expression. For our first major goal, we
propose using an exciting new oncolytic virus that only replicates, propagates, and kills cancer cells with GOF
p53 while having no effect on normal cells. We have placed two adenoviral early genes, E1A and E1B, the
genes needed for adenoviral replication, under the control of the GOF p53 inducible promoter within an
adenoviral vector. Initial studies show that this virus has remarkable oncolytic ability and specificity for lung
cancer cells with GOF p53, with no effect or viral growth whatsoever in cells with WT p53. The killing effects in
xenograft tumors with GOF p53 appear as though there is sustained accelerated tumor killing after a short delay
of when the virus is injected. We propose to enhance the oncolytic virus by adding additional lysis abilities and
by combining the suicide strategy with the oncolytic strategy. Preliminary results look very promising for this
combination. For our second goal, we propose devising a means of specifically killing lung cancer cells with
GOF p53 mutations by cloning a suicide gene downstream of our GOF p53 inducible promoter. This construct
will be introduced into an adenoviral vector so that when the virus infects cells, only cells with a GOF p53 mutation
(cancer cells) will die from prodrug treatment. We have created such a virus using the Herpes Thymidine Kinase
suicide gene and show striking killing effects and specificity for lung cancer cells with GOF p53 both in culture
and in xenograft tumors. We aim to further discover how this strategy works and ways to improve it. We propose
the use of the bacterial Cytosine Deaminase suicide gene (bCD) to enhance the bystander effect of our GOF
p53 specific suicide virus. In addition, we propose to improve the inducibility of our GOF p53 inducible promoter
to further enhance the suicide and oncolytic viruses. The potential impact of this work is far-reaching since these
strategies should be applicable for any cancer with GOF p53 mutations, which constitutes over half of all cancers."
10877993,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 The rapidly growing world population and the high rate of unintended pregnancies make contraception a
need and a priority for any public health program. While several contraceptive methods, with varying efficacy
are currently available for women, a more comprehensive approach to birth control requires extending
contraception to males. However, a safe, effective and reversible contraceptive for men is still unavailable. An
attractive approach to develop male contraceptives consists in targeting proteins that are specifically
expressed in sperm and are required for sperm fertility. We have shown that Na,K-ATPase α4 (NKAα4), a
plasma membrane ion transporter which exchanges cytoplasmic Na+ for extracellular K+, is a validated target
for male contraception. NKAα4 is uniquely expressed in testis male germ cells after meiosis, is particularly
abundant in the sperm flagellum, and is critical for sperm function. Deletion of NAKα4 in mice results in
complete sterility of only the male but not the female animals. NKAα4 is essential for sperm motility and sperm
capacitation. Its activity maintains sperm intracellular Na+ levels ([Na+]i) and several vital sperm parameters,
including membrane potential (Vm), intracellular Ca+2 ([Ca2+]i) and pH. From a biochemical standpoint, NKAα4
has a particularly high affinity for ouabain, the specific inhibitor of Na,K-ATPase. We took advantage of this
property to specifically target NKAα4 and block its function to achieve male infertility. We synthesized a series
of small molecule compounds, which can selectively bind to the high ouabain affinity site of NKAα4. Some of
these compounds inhibit NKAα4 and affect sperm motility both in vitro and after administration to mice. This
provides strong evidence for the suitability of NKAα4 as a pharmacological target and our compounds as
agents that can be used for the control of male fertility. However, before NKAα4 inhibitors can be moved
forward into their application as male contraceptives, it is necessary that their efficacy, drug-target interaction,
biomarkers for their in vitro and vivo specificity, side effects, mechanisms of action and pharmacokinetic
parameters are identified and optimized for future clinical use. We will test this in two aims. In specific aim 1,
we will develop compounds with the capacity to selectively inhibit NKAα4 and block sperm function, which will
be ready for testing in mice. Then, during specific aim 2, we will perform studies to obtain preclinical validation
to advance the NKAα4 inhibitors as male contraceptives. A series of rigorous approaches from the medicinal
chemistry and biological areas will be used to identify the compounds which will have the characteristics that
will be necessary for male contraception. This research will be essential to fulfill the highly desired unmet goal
of obtaining a non-hormonal pharmacological agent that could be used as an oral, reversible agent for the
control of male fertility."

Representing ~3% of the U.S. population, non-elderly disabled Medicare beneficiaries (henceforth “disabled
beneficiaries”) account for ~25% of overdose deaths and hospitalizations related to prescription opioids.
Among disabled beneficiaries, opioid-related harms are concentrated in the 20-25% who are prescribed long-
term opioid therapy, primarily for chronic pain. We will first examine effects of a recent, important policy
intervention – Medicare Part D opioid safety edits – on an understudied, high-risk cohort of disabled
beneficiaries who are prescribed long-term, high-dose opioid therapy (Aim 1). Effective January 1, 2019,
Medicare Part D plans are required to incorporate a set of enhanced safety edits into their drug utilization
review systems. The most salient is a “care coordination edit” alerting pharmacists when daily doses of opioid
prescriptions exceed 90 morphine milligram equivalence. The new Medicare Part D opioid safety policy is
intended to identify overprescribing through pharmacist-prescriber consultation without directly restricting
patient access (intended beneficial effect). It may also encourage the initiation of buprenorphine for opioid use
disorder treatment in lieu of high-dose opioid regimes (beneficial spillover effect). However, the possible
misinterpretation of the 90-MME threshold as a “hard stop”, coupled with administrative burdens, may prompt
rapid dose reduction and abrupt discontinuation (unintended detrimental effect). Furthermore, overrepresented
among disabled beneficiaries, racial/ethnic minority patients and rural patients may be less likely to benefit
from the Medicare Part D opioid safety policy and more susceptible to unintended harms (Aim 2). The
Medicare Part D opioid safety policy is now playing out against a backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. To
minimize potential disruptions to health care, the federal government has made temporary changes to the
Medicare telehealth and opioid regulations, which may facilitate the beneficial effects of the Medicare Part D
opioid safety policy and alleviate the detrimental policy effects (Aim 3). We will use 2017-22 Medicare claims
data and a quasi-experimental design. We will assess appropriate opioid tapering (intended beneficial effect),
inappropriate opioid tapering (unintended detrimental effect), buprenorphine initiation (beneficial spillover
effect), and opioid-related adverse events in emergency department and inpatient settings (downstream
effect). We aim to: 1. Examine effects of the first-year, pre-pandemic implementation of the Medicare Part D
opioid safety policy on disabled beneficiaries who are prescribed long-term, high-dose opioid therapy; 2.
Compare racial/ethnic and rural-urban differences in policy effects; 3. Extend Aims 1 and 2 to the pandemic
and post-pandemic eras to elucidate the interaction of the Medicare Part D opioid safety policy with flexibilities
provided during the COVID-19 emergency and beyond. Our findings will enable policymakers to develop
clinically and culturally nuanced policies and practices tailored to the disabled population, the racial/ethnic
minority patients and rural patients, and the evolving pandemic/post-pandemic environment."

Brain tumors are relatively common in children, with medulloblastoma (MB) the most frequent
type, especially in children under five. MBs can spread through the cerebrospinal fluid, and
metastases are common at the time of diagnosis. Some of the regulatory genes, signaling
pathways, and gene regulatory networks in MB are known, but the role of non-coding RNAs in
MB, particularly long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), are poorly described. By applying machine
learning to publicly available RNA-seq datasets, we found that lnc-HLX2-7 was highly upregulated
and specific for difficult-to-treat and poor prognosis grade 3 (G3) MBs compared with other
molecular subgroups. CRISPR-Cas9 depletion of lnc-HLX-2-7 in G3 MB cells significantly
reduced cell proliferation, invasion, and 3D colony formation and induced apoptosis. When lnc-
HLX-2-7-deleted G3 MB cells were injected into the mouse cerebellum, they produced
considerably smaller tumors than those derived from parental cells. Further, cerium oxide
nanoparticle-coated antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against lnc-HLX2-7 reduced in vivo tumor
growth. Our preliminary results also demonstrate that lnc-HLX-2-7 is a critical MB metabolic
regulator that modulates NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) via nicotinamide
phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), a key enzyme mediating NAD+ production. The above
results highlight the functional impact of lnc-HLX-2-7 on G3 MB development, some of the
underlying mechanisms of action, and its importance as a therapeutic target. Our central
hypothesis is that lnc-HLX-2-7 is an important oncogenic molecule that can be therapeutically
targeted in G3 MBs. We propose the following three Specific Aims to test our hypothesis: (a) to
test pre-clinical therapeutics targeting G3 MBs; (b) to delineate the lnc-HLX-2-7-driven molecular
mechanisms underlying G3 MB tumors, and (c) to identify how lnc-HLX-2-7 is regulated and
regulates other genes in G3 MBs. This study will provide valuable mechanistic insights into how
lnc-HLX-2-7 drives G3 MB development, advance pre-clinical therapeutic targeting of this
challenging subgroup, and anticipate compensatory and resistance mechanisms. This study
provides important insights into how lncRNAs function as critical oncogenes in the brain and other
cancers."

With about 50 million surgeries performed annually in the US. Opioids are commonly used as primary analgesics
to control severe surgical pain. However, opioids are associated with several adverse effects including nausea,
vomiting, sedation, and more serious respiratory depression and death. Respiratory depression is recognized
as one of the most serious, life threatening and costly complications from perioperative opioids. Although
preventable in patients undergoing surgery with effective and early predictions, opioid-induced respiratory
depression continues to be a major contributor to increased morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, cost of
healthcare and malpractice claims. The cost associated with postoperative opioid-induced respiratory
depression in the US is over $650 million annually and $231 million for children alone. While adults with
respiratory and cardiovascular concerns are at high risk of respiratory depression, children are particularly
vulnerable. Over 60% of children undergoing tonsillectomy – the most common surgical procedure in children –
are likely to experience adverse post-operative effects including respiratory depression. Current approaches rely
on reactive and delayed identification of respiratory depression using costly monitoring and extended hospital
stay for patients. Currently, there is no effective tool to proactively and reliably identify patients at high risk of
opioid-induced postoperative respiratory depression. To address this urgent and unmet need, NeurOptics is
developing a first-in-class pupillometry-based tool to proactively predict postoperative respiratory depression in
children. This technology is based on the patented pupillometry-based respiratory depression prediction model
developed by Dr. Sadhasivam through his NIH-funded clinical research. NeurOptics and Dr. Sadhasivam aim to
bring this technology to wide clinical use through this accelerated SBIR Fast-Track proposal. In Phase I,
NeurOptics will complete the development of a fully functional prototype, the A-100 device and Intelligent Patient
Interface (IPI), as proof-of-concept. Additionally, during this phase, NeurOptics will engage with the FDA for
feedback on the regulatory pathway including the first-of-kind, breakthrough device designation for the A-100.
In Phase II, NeurOptics will manufacture beta units of the device and patient interface. These will be verified and
used to validate the proposed technology through a clinical study with children undergoing tonsillectomy
conducted in collaboration with Dr. Sadhasivam. The perioperative use of this technology will help clinicians to
prevent respiratory depression, improve safety of opioids while allowing hospitals to optimize resources. Based
on the current opioid-epidemic related public health crisis and socio-economic burden of opioids (>$500
billion/year), a significant commercial market exists for NeurOptics to proactively identify and effectively reduce
opioid-related adverse effects including respiratory depression and overdoses in millions of Americans each
year."
10878991,"Somatosensory feedback from the limbs is essential for locomotion and its recovery after spinal cord injury. To achieve
stable locomotion, the spinal cord needs to process afferent feedback signals and properly adjust muscle activation and
interlimb coordination. Crossed-reflex pathways, specifically, are important for gait stability and balance, which are
impaired in various motor disorders and in the elderly. Recently, significant progress has been made in decoding the
organization and function of the central spinal locomotor circuitry and its brainstem command system. But the interactions
of somatosensory feedback with the spinal circuitry during locomotion have yet to be understood on the same level of detail.
In this project we propose to address this gap of knowledge by combing mouse genetics, in vivo electrophysiology, and
behavioral analyses with computational modeling of spinal circuits and the musculoskeletal system to systematically dissect
sensory afferent connectivity to the locomotor circuitry, including genetically identified neuron populations, and their
function in interlimb coordination. Studying the organization of crossed reflexes and their interactions with spinal locomotor
circuitry will provide critical information for rehabilitative strategies. This multidisciplinary project will be performed in
close interactive collaboration between two investigators with strong and complementary expertise in computational (Simon
Danner, PI) and experimental studies of neural control of locomotion (Turgay Akay, Co-PI). The project has the following
three aims: (1) Delineate the involvement of multiple spinal interneurons in the processing of sensory information and
interlimb coordination by studying crossed reflexes at rest and during locomotion; (2) Design a predictive computational
model of the spinal locomotor circuitry and its interactions with the mouse musculoskeletal system; (3) Integrate modeling
and experimentation to uncover underlying neural mechanisms. The model will be used to derive informative predictions
that will then be tested experimentally. This process has the advantage of providing an explicit and consistent theoretical
framework for experimentation, thereby reducing the number of necessary experiments while increasing the information
gained per experiment. In summary, the proposed multidisciplinary approach is based on state-of-art experimental and
modeling methods and will provide important and novel insights into the neural organization of the spinal locomotor
circuitry responsible for sensorimotor integration and interlimb coordination during locomotion that cannot be obtained by
experimentation or modeling alone."

>200 million people in >70 countries. The parasites live for years in what should be a very
hostile environment – the blood of vertebrates – yet they appear to elicit little if any
damaging responses from the host’s hemostatic systems. We hypothesize that proteins at
the host-interactive surface, identified in the previous funding cycle, are central to this
ability. In this competing renewal, we propose to test several key hypotheses concerning:
1) the hemostatic roles of tegumental ectoenzymes SmNPP5 & SmATPDase in vitro and
in vivo, 2) the ability of tegumental ectoenzymes SmAP & NACE to generate key nutrients
- adenosine and nicotinamide respectively - that are vital for schistosome survival and
growth and 3) the ability of tegumental calpain to impede coagulation, promote
thrombolysis and to block local thrombus formation in vivo. These studies aim to reveal the
physiological functions of these proteins and will yield significant new information on the
molecular mechanisms used by schistosomes to blunt both arms of the host thrombotic
response (platelet function and the coagulation cascade) while maintaining access to vital
nutrients. In addition, the work may identify tegumental proteins critical for parasite survival
leading to subsequent screens to discover potential schistosome-killing drugs that inhibit
these molecules and/or to trials testing their vaccine potential. In this way, our planned
experiments have the potential to reveal novel and valid targets, as well as new
treatments, for intervention in a parasite that remains a widespread and major cause of
human disease. Additionally, given wide interest in understanding the mechanisms
governing coagulation control, knowing how schistosomes regulate this process will be of
interest beyond the field of eukaryotic pathogen research."

Homeostasis represents an essential balance between adjusting to changing conditions and maintaining overall
stability, with perturbations contributing to diseases including diabetes, pancreatitis and cancers. Epigenetic
mechanisms are central to homeostasis, including histone variants and the chaperone complexes that mediate
their deposition. Histone 3.3 (H3.3) is a replacement variant for canonical histone H3 and is deposited in
heterochromatin by a complex containing DAXX and ATRX. The importance of this epigenetic regulatory axis is
emphasized by the early embryonic lethality of mice when any component is deleted, along with recurrent
somatic mutations in human cancers. This includes mutually exclusive loss-of-function mutations in DAXX or
ATRX in 43% of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. The understanding of the physiologic functions of this
regulatory complex and its component parts remains in its infancy. Emerging evidence indicates individual
components regulate cellular differentiation states, including contributing to the establishment and maintenance
of induced pluripotent stem cells in vitro and safeguarding hematopoietic stem cells against inappropriate
differentiation in vivo. Recent work by the PI demonstrates that Daxx restricts cellular plasticity in the pancreas
and maintains endogenous retroviral (ERV) silencing in vivo. This leads to the central hypothesis of the proposed
research: As a regulator of H3.3 and heterochromatin, Daxx enforces a robust chromatin landscape that is
important for the maintenance of transcriptional states and differentiation programs. The proposed studies in this
project will combine comprehensive molecular and cellular analysis to dissect how this complex regulates the
epigenome, impacts gene expression, and contributes to physiologic cell state. To interrogate the requirements
for specific protein:protein interactions, two new mouse models have been generated that abrogate the Daxx:Atrx
and Daxx:H3.3 interactions respectively. These models will be used to: Define the specific contributions of Atrx
and H3.3 to Daxx-dependent regulation of the epigenome in vivo (Aim 1); and determine the requirements for
Atrx and H3.3 in Daxx-dependent regulation of pancreatic cell state in vivo (Aim 2). As mounting data suggests
ERV repression is an important physiological function of Daxx and acknowledging the differences in repeat
genomes between species, the proposed work will determine how DAXX loss affects transcriptional and cell
state programs in the context of a human genome (Aim 3). Collectively, this project proposes an innovative
research program that integrates powerful genetic models, in vivo structure-function analysis and comprehensive
epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling to provide direct mechanistic insight into how the Daxx/Atrx/H3.3
complex contributes to chromatin maintenance and dynamics, and how specific perturbations impact
downstream transcriptional and phenotypic states. Collectively, this work contributes to the project’s long-term
goal of understanding the molecular mechanisms that maintain cellular identity and homeostasis, and the
downstream pathological consequences when these mechanisms are lost."

10877441,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Intracortical microelectrode arrays have long been used to record neural activity in basic science and clinical research studies of the brain. To date, carbon fiber microelectrodes have achieved the highest quality neural recording data with minimal immune response after implantation, but the techniques required to fabricate carbon fiber arrays do not allow for the manufacturing scale required for next-generation devices. Recent advances in thin-film fabrication have led to a new class of flexible microelectrode arrays but they require an ecosystem of complex implantation fixtures, limiting their widespread adoption. As a result, thin-film devices with neural recording quality equivalent to carbon fiber electrodes have so far eluded the neural engineering community. This project aims to use scalable fabrication methods to develop self-inserting 128-channel ultra-microelectrode arrays with unmatched recording longevity. By providing high-quality neural signals over longer periods, we aim to advance studies of long-term changes in neural circuits and implications for clinical treatments of neurological disorders. To accomplish this, the project uses amorphous silicon carbide in standard thin film fabrication. The electrode arrays are fabricated in a form factor easily implanted in the brain without any complex implantation mechanisms. The high density of microelectrodes and ultra-small dimensions of each inserted shank are designed to elicit minimal immune response. The focus of this project is a validation of the fabrication methods and device recording capabilities through a series of engineering steps as well as in vitro and in vivo testing. Specifically, the project seeks to refine the fabrication process for scalable production of 128-channel ultra-microelectrode arrays and to establish single unit yield, stability, and chronic tissue response for devices in small animal models. Engineering steps include design variations to establish repeatable fabrication of amorphous silicon carbide arrays with cross-section dimensions below 10 µm that insert without the need for additional guides, shuttles, or other structures. Finally, the project seeks to quantify the performance of the devices in multi-month in vivo studies."

When searching their environment for food, animals often switch from making random changes in direction to
reflexively orient upstream when they smell an attractive odor, followed by rhythmic turns when they lose the
plume. Random changes in direction are traditionally interpreted as manifestation of a stochastic search process.
In this proposal, we test new hypothesis for the role of these random turns: animals turn deliberately to gather
information before and after they change direction—allowing them to compute important internal and external
state parameters such as wind direction, wind speed, ground speed, and altitude that they cannot directly
measure. This idea is theoretically feasible based on the principle of observability, a powerful concept we borrow
from control theory and informatics that is critical in the design of autonomous vehicles; here, we apply it to
address fundamental questions in neuroscience. To do so, we exploit the natural behavior of flies, which execute
rapid turns (called body saccades) as they search during flight. Our research program exploits state-of-the-art
experimental techniques pioneered in the labs of team members, which we will leverage with genetic techniques
and the rapidly emerging connectome databases available to the fly community—an integrated approach that
has already provided our team with a solid foundation for our proposed effort. From wind tunnel experiments we
have discovered that hungry flies execute a brief, stereotyped turn when they first experience an odor stimulus,
which we postulate they use to estimate ambient wind direction and speed before either executing an upwind
surge, or initiating a circling behavior in still air. From physiology experiments, we discovered a small network of
identified cells that serve as command neurons for generating spontaneous saccades (DNa0X and DNb01) and
another, specialized neuron that regulates their execution during flight (VS041). These preliminary results
provide a strategic entry point for our proposed work, which is separated into four Specific Aims:
(1) Test whether DNa0X and DNb01 are responsible for saccades that mediate olfactory search.
(2) Identify upstream regulators of the saccade generating circuits responsible for the olfactory search behavior.
(3) Determine the role of spontaneous saccades in gathering information.
(4) Develop circuit-inspired, agent-based predictive models of olfactory search
This effort to elucidate the circuitry that controls both stimulus-evoked and spontaneous turns during olfactory
search and test their potential role in information-gathering links the ethologically important behavior of olfactory
search across spatial and temporal scales—from the transient responses of individual neurons to the long flight
trajectories of whole animals as they search for food. While not widely used in systems neuroscience, we believe
that the concept of observability will provide a major conceptual advance in understanding how brains function;
specifically, how the nervous system can collect information at different points in time and space and use it to
compute parameters that are for critical subsequent behavioral actions."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second deadliest cancer, and patients’ survival rate drops from 90% to 14% when
cancer metastasizes to distant organs. Herein, we proposed investigating the role of a long noncoding RNA
(LncRNA) in anoikis resistance and CRC metastasis. Metastasis is a multistep process, and one of the key
steps is to acquire anoikis resistance to survive after detachment from the primary sites. Thus, understanding
the molecular players involved in the anoikis process and metastasis could be vital for improving the survival of
CRC patients. The aberrant expression of a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) urothelial carcinoma-associated 1
(UCA1) has been identified in CRC; however, its roles in metastasis processes are not yet well defined. Our
preliminary results in the anchorage-independent growth (anoikis model) demonstrate increased lncRNA UCA1
and Glucose Transporter1 (GluT1) protein expression. Moreover, the overexpression of lncRNA UCA1 led
to high Glut1 expression and higher glucose uptake in CRC cells, which indicates a potential mechanistic role of
lncRNA UCA1 in anoikis resistance. In this study, we propose to elucidate the role(s) of UCA1 and its associated
signaling pathways during anoikis resistance. We hypothesize that the overexpression of lncRNA UCA1
enhances CRC metastasis through anoikis resistance-associated signaling pathways. We will utilize Isogenic
CRC cell lines SW480 (oncogenic) and SW620 (metastatic) to understand the mechanistic regulation of anoikis
resistance. AIM 1 is proposed to elucidate lncRNA UCA1 associated molecular mechanisms involved in anoikis
resistance and CRC metastasis. We propose to study the role of lncRNA UCA1 in anoikis resistance using
Lentiviral transduced stable overexpression (SW480+UCA1//GFP) and knockdown (SW620+CRISPRgUCA1)
cell lines using cell cycle, pro-survival, anti-apoptotic, stemness, glucose metabolism, kinase phosphorylation
immunoprecipitation (IP), co-IP and Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) assays. In AIM 2, we proposed investigating
UCA1 linked proteins, RNAs, and pathways associated with anoikis resistance. We will use stable isogenic
lncRNA UCA1 (OE and KD) cell line models and an unbiased approach to identify novel UCA1 associated/linked
proteins and RNAs using Biotin-ReCLP (Reversible Cross-Linked Precipitation), in vivo RNA Antisense
Proteomics (iRAP), and RNAseq analyses and validate them by RT-PCR, ddPCR, IP, co-IP and PLA studies.
While AIM 3 is proposed to evaluate the functional impact of lncRNA UCA1 expression using a metastatic mouse
model. In this aim, SCID adult male/female mice will be injected with Luciferase expressing validated stable
isogenic human CRC cell lines (UCA1 OE and KD as in aim1) through the portal vein, and their metastatic
potential will be evaluated by bioluminescence imaging. This study will provide new insights into CRC metastasis
and will help in developing innovative therapeutics to improve patients’ survival, generate data for future NIH
proposals, and training of Hispanic underserved minority students at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley
(UTRGV), which is a prominent Hispanic serving institution in South Texas Rio Grande Valley region."
10887512,"SUMMARY
 Myeloid cells of the innate immune system (neutrophils and macrophages) interact closely with the
vascular endothelium to modulate inflammatory and resolution responses. During early stages of the
inflammatory response, inappropriate neutrophils activation causes vascular and parenchymal injury.
However, in late stages of inflammation, precisely-controlled neutrophil resolution mechanisms are now
considered to be critical to limit tissue damage and initiate regeneration of new vascular channels and
parenchymal tissues. Even though neutrophil function in early stages of inflammatory processes is well
understood, their involvement in resolution responses is poorly understood. We have found that the
sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor-1 (S1PR1), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with
well-established functions in vascular and adaptive immune (T and B) cells, regulates neutrophil resolution
responses. Specifically, S1PR1 signaling induces a non-inflammatory, long-lived neutrophil phenotype that
undergoes efficient phagocytosis. We also found that this novel and unappreciated function of neutrophil
S1PR1 signaling axis is critical for efficient recovery from virus-induced lung injury and chemical-induced acute
liver failure. To activate this beneficial process, we developed a novel biologic based on our knowledge of S1P
chaperones. We hypothesize that local S1PR1 signaling in neutrophils is a general mechanism that resolves
inflammatory tissue injury and thus enable vascular and parenchymal regeneration in multiple organ systems.
Furthermore, we posit that therapeutic activation of this signaling axis may provide a novel strategy to control
chronic smoldering inflammation that lead to fibrotic diseases and organ dysfunction. To test this hypothesis,
we will examine GPCR proximal mechanisms and nuclear transcriptional events that are regulated by S1PR1
in tissue neutrophils during resolution responses. Second, we will examine the importance of this signaling
axis in resolution responses that are induced after virus-induced lung injury and chemical-induced liver injury in
mouse models. Third, we will obtain proof-of-concept data to activate this signaling axis that utilize engineered
designer HDL particles that contain ApoA1 and ApoM to stimulate neutrophil resolution responses and
enhance vascular endothelial survival and regeneration. These data are anticipated to reveal novel
mechanisms of resolution processes and enable innovative therapeutic strategies to control chronic
inflammatory diseases."

Metastasis, the spread of cancer from primary tumor site to distal organs, is the cause of over 80% of deaths
from cancer. The brain is one of the common metastasis locations. Brain metastasis, which develops in the late
course of illness, has become a significant problem in clinic due to its rising incidence as a consequence of
prolonged survival and limited efficacy of existing systemic therapies. Metastasis is a multi-step process that
requires the complex interplay between cancer cells and the stromal cells, a process commonly referred to as
“seed and soil hypothesis” coined over a century ago. The ‘soil’, the microenvironment, not only decides the
outgrowth of metastatic cancer cells, but also contributes to therapy resistance. The ‘seed’, the invaded cancer
cells, directly modifies the surrounding brain stromal cells. Our long-term goal is to dissect the complex
interactions between cancer cells and brain stromal cells during metastasis.
We have developed novel in vivo and in vitro models to address the gaps in our understanding of brain
microenvironmental control of metastatic outgrowth. Our data implicate that astrocytes, the unique and most
abundant brain cells, activate PPARγ signaling in brain metastatic melanoma cells. Through an integrative
approach using in vitro co-culture assays and in vivo brain metastatic mouse models, Aim 1 will delineate the
role of PPARγ pathway in melanoma cells during brain metastasis. We will track the dynamic changes and effect
of PPARγ signaling in melanoma cells throughout the whole brain metastatic process. Moreover, PPARγ
antagonist will be used in our pre-clinical mouse models to test its potential to treat melanoma brain metastasis.
Aim 2 will address how astrocytes activate PPARγ signaling in the invades melanoma cells. We hypothesize
that astrocytes serve as ‘donor’ of unsaturated fatty acids, natural agonist of PPARγ, to the invaded melanoma
cells. The gained insights may enable us to mechanistically deconstruct melanoma brain metastasis and develop
new treatment strategies for patients with little clinical recourse."

BACKGROUND: Integrated behavioral health (IBH) holds great promise for improving care quality and
outcomes for patients with co-occurring mental and physical health conditions by embedding mental health and
substance use treatment services into primary care settings. Despite over two decades of effort, however,
there still lacks widespread IBH implementation due to insufficient leadership skills to overcome organizational,
attitudinal, and financial challenges. This study develops and tests an evidence-based IBH intervention that
incorporates leadership concepts to prepare primary care teams to overcome IBH challenges and lead IBH
implementation initiatives.
SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1 is to identify IBH implementation challenges, strategies, and leadership skills needed
to successfully implement IBH. Aim 2 is to develop an intervention that uses IBH implementation strategies and
leadership training to accelerate IBH into primary care settings. Aim 3 is to conduct a preliminary effectiveness,
feasibility, and acceptability pilot by implementing and evaluating the intervention in practice settings.
METHODS: I use sequential, complementarity mixed methods and draw upon a conceptual model that blends
the implementation science EPIS (Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment) framework with
AHRQ’s Integration Framework. Aim 1 uses depth interviews with nationally-renowned IBH stakeholders to
develop an inventory of IBH challenges, strategies, and leadership skills. Aim 2 uses a 4-round modified Delphi
approach with IBH stakeholders to develop the intervention. Aim 3 uses the New Jersey Primary Care
Research Network to recruit 5-10 primary care practices serving health disparity populations. The intervention
is delivered to all practice members using practice facilitation, and I will conduct a series of assessment to
determine the preliminary effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of the intervention in improving leadership
skills to address IBH challenges (intermediary outcome) and integrated care processes (primary outcome).
IMPACT: This study is novel because it draws upon national IBH experts to develop an intervention that
identifies and consolidates IBH strategies and leadership skills that have been effective with IBH
implementation in real-world settings. Second, this study produces a systematically-developed intervention that
pairs IBH implementation challenges with specific leadership skills for overcoming them, refined and prioritized
for action. Third, this is the first study to map the AHRQ Integration Framework to an implementation science
framework. Resulting data informs future refining and testing of the intervention in additional clinical settings."

The liver is our largest metabolic organ. It produces proteins, lipids, clotting factors and glycogen while dispensing bile and detoxifying xenobiotics. In order to transport these different substances, a sophisticated network of liver venules, capillaries and interstitial conduits has evolved. An essential feature of this network are the lumen-forming epithelia that give rise to two major liver cell populations: (1) hepatocytes - the main parenchymal cell type, and (2) bile duct cells. Both acquire radically different polarity phenotypes adapted to their different functions (Fig.1): Bile duct cells, which form simple conduits for bile, organize like other tubular epithelia around a central lumen. Hepatocytes, by contrast form single-cell cords, aligned along blood vessels on either side and with a capillary-like luminal network (bile canaliculi) running between them. This organization facilitates their extensive bi-directional molecular exchange with the blood, while allowing bile acid excretion into the bile canaliculi. How hepatocytes obtain this unique morphological phenotype is poorly understood. Indeed, because bile canaliculi are not visible by conventional H&E tissue stain, the study of hepatocyte polarity has largely been neglected. The resulting gap in our knowledge has greatly hindered our ability to better understand the molecular basis of common liver diseases, which typically present with changes in hepatocyte polarity and morphology. It also severely limits our ongoing efforts to engineer hepatic tissue that can be used for transplantation, toxicology and gene therapy studies.
To tackle these issues, we developed a unique tissue culture model in which the polarity phenotype can be switched from ductal to hepatocytic and utilized it to identify molecular mechanisms that distinguish the hepatocytic from the ductal polarization program. In parallel, we developed protocols to in vitro differentiate polarized hepatocytes from their precursors and evaluated proteins critical for the hepatocytic polarity switch in these physiological relevant systems. This led to the discovery of the dual PKA-anchoring and Rho-activating protein AKAP13 as regulator of bile canaliculi elongation. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying its function, as proposed here, will reveal a critical morphological mechanisms of hepatocyte polarization."

presence, size and density of hair follicles and sweat glands, that are reflected in differential responses to
injury and disease. As examples, androgenetic alopecia is limited to the scalp; acne predominates in facial
skin; psoriasis is often most prominent in extensor regions; palmoplantar keratoderma is limited to palms and
soles; and vitiligo can appear in symmetrical patterns. While regional characteristics of the skin are established
during fetal development, positional information must be retained in the skin throughout life to allow for
maintenance of regional characteristics and their re-establishment in wound healing. Positional information is
known to reside in the skin dermis, but its molecular basis is poorly understood. To address this question, we
propose the following Specific Aims. AIM 1: To identify candidate factors and areas of chromatin involved in
establishing skin heterogeneity in embryogenesis we will analyze transcriptional profiles through single cell
RNA-seq, and chromatin structure via single cell ATAC-seq, in distinct regions of developing skin to identify
those that show region-specific expression or openness, respectively. AIM 2: (i) To determine which of these
candidate factors and chromatin areas may also be responsible for maintaining regional skin heterogeneity in
adult life, we will perform the same analyses on the corresponding areas of adult skin. (ii) We hypothesize that
epigenetic mechanisms contribute to maintenance of regional skin characteristics. To test this, we will first
identify patterns of DNA methylation and histone modifications that characterize developing dermis in specific
skin regions by carrying out Bisulfite-seq to reveal sites of DNA methylation, and CUT&RUN for histone
modifications that mark enhancers and active, repressed, or poised genes. We will then ask which of these
patterns are maintained in adult dermal cells from the same regions. AIM 3: To test the functions of candidate
regulators in directing and maintaining region-specific differentiation programs, we will use inducible genetic
tools to delete the corresponding genes in developing or adult mouse dermis in vivo. Together, these
experiments provide a comprehensive and unbiased approach to identify novel mechanisms that establish and
maintain skin heterogeneity. Improved understanding of these mechanisms has potential to reveal new
therapeutic targets in wound healing and in common and rare diseases that affect specific skin regions and
have a major negative impact on quality of life; data obtained in this project will also inform strategies for
generating specific skin types, including hair follicle- and sweat gland-bearing skin, for reparative skin grafting."

Many antitubulin agents, such as paclitaxel (Taxol), have been used extensively for treatment of
several types of cancer, including ovarian, lung, pancreatic, and breast cancers. Despite their
wide use in cancer treatment, however, patient response is highly variable and drug resistance
remains a major clinical issue. It is therefore essential to identify prognostic markers to predict the
patient response and to enhance drug sensitivity. Protein kinase R (PKR) plays significant roles
in innate immune response to viral infection and tumorigenesis. The biological significance of PKR
in antitubulin chemotherapeutics and underlying mechanisms have yet to be defined. Through
Phos-tag-based kinome-wide biochemical screens, we identified PKR as a critical regulator in
antitubulin cytotoxicity. Our preliminary data suggest that inactivation of PKR confers resistance
to Taxol in ovarian and breast cancer cells. Enhanced expression of PKR potentiates taxol
cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. We further identified novel phosphorylation sites on PKR during
antitubulin-mitotic arrest and in normal mitosis. Mechanistically, our findings also suggest that
PKR controls Taxol chemosensitivity through modulating Bcl2 expression. Our hypothesis is that
the PKR-Bcl2 axis functions as a therapeutic target for antitubulin agent-based
chemotherapeutics in treatment of drug-resistant and/or recurrent patients. We will test our central
hypothesis by three specific aims. Aim 1: Examine the functional significance of PKR in antitubulin
chemotherapeutics in vivo; Aim 2: Determine how antitubulin drugs regulate PKR; Aim 3:
Elucidate the mechanisms and downstream signaling of PKR in antitubulin chemosensitivity. The
identification of new regulators and/or signaling pathways triggered by antitubulin drugs will shed
light on the mechanisms underlying chemoresistance. Our study suggests that combining kinase
activators (e.g., being characterized in this application) for PKR or Bcl2 inhibitors (FDA-approved)
with antitubulin agents will have enhanced efficacy in treatment of drug-resistant and/or recurrent
patients. Our findings also suggest that profiling PKR-Bcl2 signaling status of tumors
(mRNA/protein levels and activity) can be useful to predict the patient response to antitubulin
chemotherapeutics."
10889937,"Dementia is associated with selective degeneration of microscopic and macroscale neuronal networks
resulting in heterogeneous clinical features. Data from human neuropathology and experimental models
support the hypothesis that neurodegenerative disease pathologies spread through selectively vulnerable
neuronal networks. Frontotemporal dementia can manifest clinically as behavioral variant of FTD (bvFTD) or
primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Both clinical phenotypes can be associated with the accumulation of
protein aggregates in affected brain regions composed of either TDP-43 or tau protein. Understanding how
networks degenerate in fronototemporal dementia is important in terms of understanding the progression of
disease as it relates to variable clinical and pathologic subtypes. The goal of this project is to perform single
cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of key regions that degenerate in frontotemporal lobar degeneration to
identify cellular-level molecular networks that are specifically altered due to TDP-43 versus tau pathology in
behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and primary progressive aphasia. Novel bioinformatics
approaches will be applied to scRNAseq datasets to identify neuronal cell types and molecular networks which
are selectively vulnerable in frontotemporal dementia clinicopathologic subtypes."
10889938,"TDP-43 pathological inclusions are associated with a spectrum of clinical syndromes including behavioral
variant frontotemporal degeneration (bvFTD), primary progressive aphasia (PPA), or amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, approximately 10% of bvFTD or PPA patients share neuromuscular features of ALS
(ALS-FTD). Beyond the clinical complexities of the FTD and ALS spectrum associated with TDP-43, there are
also many shared genetic links between these conditions including C9orf72 repeat expansions and TARDBP
mutations that can result in bvFTD and/or ALS as well as disparate genetic mutations that exclusively result in
FTD (e.g., GRN) or ALS (e.g., SOD1). The overall hypothesis of this project is that molecular heterogeneity,
and specifically regionally-variable gene expression, contributes to macroscale network vulnerability
contributing to a spectrum of clinically heterogeneous syndromes. It is critical to better understand the
neuroanatomic and clinical features of gene expression in the current era of precision medicine in which there
are antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) and adeno-associated vector (AAV) viral genetic therapies that aim to
modify gene expression which have recently received FDA-approval for neuromuscular disorders and are
underway for C9orf72 and GRN. While prior studies suggest that genetic and epigenetic variation contributes
to the spectrum of heterogeneity in FTD and ALS, evaluations of the relationships between gene expression
and disease phenotype are rare. This project aims to establish biological and genetic factors that influence
regional anatomic disease burden which will provide regionally-specific biomarkers to track in emerging genetic
therapies. We propose three Specific Aims: (1) Identify regional relationships between molecular gene
expression and macroscale networks that bias risk for a specific clinical syndrome. We will interrogate publicly-
available regional RNA microarray data and relate patterns of covariance from TDP-associated genes to
structurally and functionally-derived networks that are associated with distinct bvFTD, PPA, and ALS
syndromes; (2) Establish convergence between gene expression and in vivo neuroimaging networks of FTD
and ALS patients. We will relate regional RNA microarray data of healthy individuals to in vivo cortical
thickness and graph-theoretic network features (e.g., degree, path length) defined in Core E that are derived
from FTD and/or ALS patients with inherited disease recruited from Core B and scanned using 3T MRI in Core
C. We hypothesize that the regional distribution of gene covariance in typical adults will relate to the regional
distribution of neurodegeneration in individuals with genetic mutations; and (3) Determine the manner in which
modifiers of gene expression impact network structure in FTD & ALS. Using principles of network control
theory we will leverage naturally-occurring heterogeneity in gene expression, including epigenetic (e.g., DNA
methylation) and common genetic (e.g., allele dosage) factors, to determine whether these gene enhancing or
silencing sources of heterogeneity are associated with altered network distributions of disease."
10889939,"TDP-43 proteinopathy is a common form of neurodegenerative dementia (i.e. frontotemporal dementia, FTD) in
patients younger than 65 (i.e. frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 proteinopathy, FTLD-TDP) and is
a common co-pathology in Alzheimer’s disease and aging. There are currently no biomarker modalities that
can accurately identify and track TDP-43 mediated neurodegeneration in living patients, which poses a major
obstacle for clinical trials targeting TDP-43 associated mechanisms of disease. Indeed, FTLD-TDP is an
incurable condition and cannot be reliably diagnosed and differentiated from clinically similar patients with
tauopathy (FTLD-Tau) during life, making autopsy the gold-standard for diagnosis. The overarching goal of this
project is to integrate digital histology of human brain tissue with high-resolution ex vivo 7 Tesla (7T) magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) to model TDP-43 disease in the human brain connectome. We aim to first use ex
vivo 7T MRI guided sampling of grey matter (GM) regions important for neurocognitive networks that underly
FTD clinical symptoms and contrast the distribution of TDP-43 and clinically indistinguishable FTLD-Tau to
determine microscopic GM cellular patterns of TDP-43 protienopathy. Next, we will examine TDP-43 pathology
in uniquely sampled deep white matter (WM) tracts and contrast the distribution of TDP-43 and tau pathology
in WM pathways of neurocognitive networks using graph theoretic analysis. Finally, we will examine GM
laminar features of TDP-43 pathology in 7T MRI ex vivo imaging. Successful completion of these aims will
provide critically needed autopsy-data to guide development of histopathology-validated markers of
progressive microscopic TDP-43 disease in macroscale neurocognitive networks implicated in FTD."
10889942,"Clinical research criteria for primary progressive aphasia (PPA) reliably identify semantic variant PPA (svPPA)
and non-fluent/agrammatic variant PPA (naPPA). While statistically associated with underlying pathology,
neither these criteria nor regional MRI atrophy reliably support in vivo diagnosis of frontotemporal lobar
degeneration (FTLD pathology) in an individual with sporadic FTLD-TDP or FTLD-Tau. We propose to identify
macroscale network metrics and ultra-high resolution 7 tesla (7T) MRI profiles that are sensitive to both
regional anatomic features and cortical laminar features in sporadic PPA variants, and we validate our findings
in antemortem imaging of autopsy-confirmed cases and in familial FTLD (fFTLD) mutation carriers with known
pathology. We pursue these goals in three Specific Aims. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that multimodal 3T
structural MRI (sMRI) and diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) networks show distinct graph theoretic metrics in
sporadic svPPA and naPPA that are sensitive to both regional anatomic and laminar-specific features of
disease, and assesses the same features in antemortem MRI of sporadic autopsied cases and in fFTLD
mutation carriers with FTLD-TDP and FTLD-Tau, respectively. We also relate degraded network features to
inexpensive targeted linguistic measures that can screen for disease. This hypothesis is based on findings in
our clinical-pathological series, showing that FTLD-TDP has anterior temporal and orbital frontal pathology
related to sMRI atrophy in the same regions, often in svPPA with impaired naming, and that pathology is
denser in superficial laminae; by comparison, FTLD-Tau has inferior frontal and midfrontal pathology related to
sMRI atrophy, often in naPPA with non-fluent speech, and pathology is relatively denser in deeper laminae. In
Aim 2, we test the hypothesis that partially distinct metrics of progressive disease are seen in longitudinal,
multimodal 3T MRI network of sporadic svPPA and naPPA, and that these overlap in part with network metrics
in antemortem longitudinal imaging of autopsied PPA and fFTLD cases associated with FTLD-TDP and FTLD-
Tau, respectively. Aim 3 examines combined laminar and regional anatomic features more directly by
assessing ultrahigh resolution 7T MRI in PPA and fFTLD cases. 7T MRI is expected to identify relatively
distinct cortical laminar and white matter (WM) features in sporadic svPPA vs. naPPA, and in fFTLD with
FTLD-TDP vs. FTLD-Tau pathology, respectively, and these will overlap in part with distinguishing network
metrics found at 3T. This is based on preliminary findings that ex vivo 7T MRI of autopsied cases shows
relatively distinct, pathology-determined cortical laminar and WM features: FTLD-TDP pathology is denser in
superficial cortical laminae, while FTLD-Tau pathology is relatively denser in deeper laminae and has greater
WM pathology. Novel, pathology-guided, cortical laminar features, combined with regional anatomic markers,
will lay the groundwork for innovative methods to distinguish FTLD-TDP from FTLD-Tau in vivo, and lead to
longitudinal markers for disease progression urgently needed for disease-modifying treatment trials."
10899681,"Project Summary/Abstract
American adults have a high prevalence of overweight, obesity and prediabetes. Small weight loss delays the
progression to type 2 diabetes and decrease cardiovascular risk, yet adherence to long-term calorie restriction
is difficult to sustain. There is an urgency to find effective, easy-to-implement and sustain, and affordable life
style interventions. Restricting the food intake interval, or time restricted eating (TRE) has been shown in
small-scale pilot studies to result in weight loss and improve metabolism, while being less challenging than
calorie count. We propose to rigorously assess the efficacy of TRE, administered via a smartphone application,
on weight loss and decreased cardiovascular risk. To achieve this goal, metabolically unhealthy mid-life adults
with overweight or obesity who habitually eat for more than 14h/day, will be randomized to a restricted eating
window to 10h/d (TRE) or to their habitual eating window (≥ 14h, HABIT), and followed up to 12 months.
Ambulatory measures of food intake, sleep, physical activity and glucose, and in-patient 24-h well-controlled
studies will be done to determine the effect of TRE versus habitual eating duration (HABIT), as well as the
mediators of these effects. Hypotheses: 1) TRE vs. HABIT will result in decreased fat mass, measured by
quantitative magnetic resonance, and effect mediated via decreased daily total energy intake, measured by
double labeled water; 2) TRE vs. HABIT will result in lower insulin resistance, lower glycemia and shift in fuel
utilization preferentially to lipid mobilization; 2) Adherence to TRE (measured by usage of the app and
reduction of the eating window), and self-efficacy will associate with the short-term effect (3 months) and the
long-term sustainability (12 months) of TRE on fat mass loss. Results from this study will provide important
insights into understanding the physiological and molecular interactions between restricting daily eating interval
and metabolic function, and could provide evidence for using TRE interventions to improve metabolic health
and decrease cardiovascular risk in the large number of mid-life and older Americans in great need of life style
intervention."

This proposal presents a 4 year research career development program focused on the study of
macroautophagy (autophagy) in the context of HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) to increase
the understanding of HAND pathogenesis with the goal of identifying targets for treatment of HAND. The
candidate is currently an Instructor of Infectious Diseases and of Pathology at Montefiore Medical
Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The proposal builds on the candidate’s previous HIV research and
clinical experiences by integrating two new domains of expertise, overseen by her mentors, Dr. Berman and
Dr. Cuervo. The proposed experiments and didactic work will provide Dr. Cheney with the skill sets to enable
her transition to independence as a Principal Investigator at the crossroads of neuroHIV and macroautophagy.
A significant number of people with HIV (PWH) develop HAND despite control of viremia with antiretroviral
therapy (ART). Efforts to treat HAND are hindered by an incomplete understanding of the factors underlying its
development. Data suggest that dysregulated autophagy may contribute to HAND, but much remains to be
understood, specifically in astrocytes. It is essential to maintain astrocyte homeostasis because they are major
support cells of the brain, performing many vital functions for the CNS. As astrocytes rely on autophagy for
homeostasis, it is particularly important to understand dysregulated astrocyte autophagy as it may contribute to
HAND. The foundation for this proposal is based on our published data demonstrating an inhibitory effect on
autophagy in primary human astrocytes resulting from treatment with a commonly prescribed regimen of
Tenofovir, Emtricitabine and Raltegravir (ART). The aims of this proposal are to: 1. Characterize ART induced
changes in autophagy in human astrocytes, 2. Characterize selective autophagy in human astrocytes treated
with ART, and 3. Define changes in astrocyte-specific functions as a result of ART treatment, and correlate
with changes in autophagy. These aims will expand the understanding of HAND development in PWH in the
ART era, with the ultimate objective of identifying therapeutic targets with which to mitigate HAND."

exceeding both HIV and COVID-19. TB remains an enormous public health problem in Ethiopia which is on the
WHO list of high burden TB and TB/HIV countries and has increasing rates of drug-resistant TB. Critical
shortages of well-trained TB investigators in Ethiopia and globally remain a major barrier to achieving the WHO
End TB Strategy goals. This renewal D43 application for the Ethiopia-Emory TB Research Training Program
(EETB-RTP) builds on the success, progress, and lessons learned during the past decade. The EETB-RTP
benefits from a successful partnership between Emory University in Atlanta and 3 Ethiopian institutions in
Addis Ababa: the Armauer Hansen Research Institute (AHRI), an internationally recognized research institute
with a major focus on TB investigation; Addis Ababa University, the oldest and largest degree granting
university in Ethiopia; and the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, which along with AHRI, is part of the Ethiopian
Ministry of Health (MOH). Important progress has been achieved, especially during the current funding cycle,
in developing TB research infrastructure in Ethiopia and in training early-stage investigators who are now
emerging as leaders in TB research and as mentors for a new generation of trainees. Since 2013, the EETB-
RTP has provided long-term training to 40 Ethiopian trainees helping to establish an emerging critical mass of
MD and PhD-level investigators focused on TB-related clinical and translational research. The proportion of
women trainees has increased from 4/19 (21%) in the first funding cycle to 11/21 (52%) in the current 5-year
cycle. Despite the challenges encountered due to the impact of COVID-19, our EETB-RTP Fogarty trainees
have had 164 TB and/or COVID-19 peer reviewed publications during the current funding cycle. Ethiopian
trainees also secured $1.55 million in external grant funding during the current cycle and a total of $2.89 million
since program inception. To further momentum and establish a viable plan for sustainability, an important focus
of this application is to continue to transfer program management to Ethiopian investigators and expand the
pool of influential TB mentors in Ethiopia. We propose an innovative TB research training program to overcome
critical gaps that remain in the TB research/research training infrastructure. Specific Aims include: 1) Continue
to build relevant and sustainable research capacity in Ethiopia by aligning research training activities with the
priorities outlined in the MOH’s “National TB Research Roadmap (2022-2026)”; 2) Support career development
to promote the 7 professional characteristics of a translational scientist aligned with leadership in TB research;
3) Implement a new Advanced Training Track which will provide advanced grant writing instruction, mentor and
leadership training to former Ethiopian Fogarty trainees to optimize their transition into independent
investigators and mentors for the next generation of Ethiopian investigators; and 4) Enhance diversity of the
Ethiopian TB biomedical workforce by continuing to increase the number of women engaged in TB research."

The 2024 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Immunometabolism in Health and Disease will be the
second GRC on the interface of cellular metabolism and immunity (or “immunometabolism”), a cutting-edge,
emerging field in immunology. Cellular metabolism serves as both a fundamental mechanistic driver of and
intervenable therapeutic target in infectious, allergic, and other immune-mediated diseases. The realization that
metabolism is reprogrammed during the immune response and that bioenergetic and other metabolites are
‘repurposed’ to modulate immune functions has led to a recent paradigm shift. As this young and interdisciplinary
field accelerates, there is a critical need to convene experts and trainees alike. To this end, we are holding a
meeting at Bryant University in Smithfield, Rhode Island from June 16–21, 2024. We are assembling international
experts, both from academia and industry, on the role of cellular metabolism in the programming of myeloid and
lymphoid immune cells in immunity and disease, and thus expect to foment productive, high-level discussions
and collaborations, as well as significant interest among early-career investigators and trainees. Among the
Specific Aims of our meeting are presentation of cutting-edge unpublished science, discussion and resolution
of current controversies in the field, identification/prioritization of unmet needs in the field, stimulation of new
collaborations, and provision of a comfortable and productive forum for trainees and early-stage investigations
to learn and share their findings. Starting with a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) organized by and focused
on trainee and early-stage investigators for scientific presentations and career development, the Co-Chairs, Drs.
Catherine ""Lynn"" Hedrick and Jeffrey Rathmell and Vice Chairs Drs. Ping-Chi Ho and Nancie MacIver have
planned nine oral sessions to promote dialogue among established leaders in immunometabolism and emerging
experts ranging from trainees to early-career scientists. Each session will also include short talks from abstracts
submitted to the GRC. Session 1 – Principles of Immunometabolism. Session 2 - T Cell Immunometabolism.
Session 3 – Inflammation and Autoimmunity. Session 4 – Metabolic Control of Innate Immunity. Session 5 –
Microbiome Influence on Metabolism and Immunity. Session 6 – Obesity, Diabetes, and Cardiovascular
Disease. Session 7 – Obesity and Aging in Cancer. Session 8 – Tumor Microenvironment. Session 9 –
Translating Immunometabolism. Invited speakers and discussion leaders are diverse and inclusive, including
women (55%), early-stage investigators (24%), underrepresented minority groups (10%), international experts
from five countries outside the US (13%), with 66% new to this GRC. The focus of our conference will advance
understanding of infectious, allergic, and immune-mediated diseases, and we are honored to invite NIH
administration officials as attendees. Our meeting agenda addresses diverse topics related to the crosstalk
between immunity and metabolism in myeloid and lymphoid cells in immune-mediated diseases, including
infection, allergy, autoimmunity, cancer, atherosclerosis, obesity, and diabetes."
10898510,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The healthy auditory system processes and ultimately makes sense of complex dynamic sounds that
vary spectrally and temporally. This complicated process allows for human and non-human species to
communicate in both quiet and noisy environments. Significant advances in the understanding of spatiotemporal
processing has come from human behavioral studies and physiological animal experiments using frequency
sweep stimuli, which are sounds that glide upwards or downwards with frequency over time. Human behavioral
data shows that up-sweeps are substantially more effective at masking a tone compared to down-sweeps (> 20
dB). The behavioral literature attributes the dependence on sweep direction to cochlear dispersion, which
involves variations in the shape of the basilar membrane (BM) waveform generated by each masker. Due to
dispersion, the BM waveform for the down-sweep is peakier compared to the broader response of the up-sweep.
Consequently, the presence of a down-swept masker allows for easier detection of the signal in the dips of its
waveform. This interpretation finds support in animal measurements and physiological models.
 While the dispersion mechanism has been used to explain the masking effects between upward and
downward sweeps, recent measurements of cochlear vibration in mouse also reveal differences in the cochlear
suppression produced by upward and downward swept suppressors and these differences are dependent on
sweep rate. Suppression is thought to be important for auditory tasks such as understanding speech in noisy
environments. Similar measures of suppression using up- and down-swept stimuli have not been conducted in
humans, nor have the suppression effects been compared to behavioral masking. Furthermore, although human
behavioral experiments have shown masking differences for upward and downward swept maskers over a range
of sweep rates, none of these studies explored what I hypothesize are perhaps the most interesting range of
rates (i.e., sweep rates similar to the velocity of the BM traveling wave or to frequency transitions in speech).
 The proposed aims use a combination of behavioral and otoacoustic measures to study the effects of
sweep rate and direction using swept stimuli as either behavioral maskers or otoacoustic suppressors.
Otoacoustic emissions are advantageous as they provide a powerful, non-invasive measure of outer hair cell
function, enabling the study of suppression effects in humans and their correlation to behavioral masking. The
study will pursue the following aims: 1) Determine the strength of behavioral masking as a function of sweep
rate and direction, and 2) Determine the strength of cochlear suppression as a function of sweep rate
and direction. Completion of the proposed aims will advance understanding of the role of suppression in
processing dynamic sounds that vary in rate and direction. The results may provide a framework for studying
how this process is impacted with impairment, as suppression is greatly reduced with cochlear damage."

Background: One in four people living with COPD – 96 million people worldwide – have never smoked. Most
COPD mortality occurs in regions of the world where smoking is uncommon, like sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV
and air pollution may be driving COPD mortality among the estimated 26 million Africans with COPD. People
living with HIV (PLWH) experience persistent systemic inflammation and increased risk of chronic lung disease.
Like HIV, air pollution – the leading environmental cause of death globally – causes systemic inflammation and
significantly worsens lung health. HIV and air pollution operate through similar inflammatory pathways that are
destructive to lung tissues. Thus, PLWH who are exposed to air pollution may face particularly high risk of lung
disease. If shared inflammatory pathways accentuate lung disease risk among PLWH exposed to air pollution,
then targeting these pathways could have outsized clinical impact. The hypothesis of this project is that PLWH
experience greater air pollution-associated lung inflammation and lung dysfunction than HIV-uninfected people.
I helped establish a four-year collaboration between Massachusetts General Hospital, Mbarara University of
Science and Technology, and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health that has enabled air quality monitoring
in southwestern Uganda and is poised to investigate this novel area of research. Candidate: Dr. North's
overarching career goal is to become an independent investigator focused on environmental exposures and lung
health among PLWH. Her clinical work caring for patients with chronic lung disease and leading research
investigating the epidemiology of chronic lung disease in Uganda have inspired this career path. She is well-
prepared to undertake the scientific and training aims proposed here, having successfully published eight first-
author manuscripts, three middle-author manuscripts, and completed a 2016 pilot study of air quality in rural
Uganda. Mentoring: Dr. Mark Siedner (Primary mentor) is an NIH-funded investigator who has successfully
mentored 4 NIH K awardees. Drs. Petros Koutrakis (personal air pollution measurement), Bethany Hedt-Gauthier
(biostatistics), and Benjamin Medoff (immune-mediated lung injury), will provide additional focused mentoring to
ensure Dr. North's success. Research: Leveraging an ongoing, R01-funded cohort of 300 HIV-infected and 300
age- and sex-similar, HIV-uninfected participants, Dr. North will add personal air pollution monitoring and
research bronchoscopy to ongoing study procedures in order to characterize personal air pollution exposure and
examine relationships between air pollution, lung inflammation and lung function. Training: To achieve her aims
and become an independent researcher, Dr. North requires additional training in 1) personal air pollution
measurement, 2) advanced biostatistics including structural equation modeling, and 3) immune-mediated lung
injury. Based on her previous research experience, expanding publication record, exceptional mentoring team,
strong institutional commitment, and innovative research plan, Dr. North is well-positioned to become an
independent clinical investigator focused on environmental exposures and lung health among PLWH."
10899689,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Giardia lamblia, the causative agent of giardiasis, leads to gastrointestinal disorders, long-term growth
defects and even death. Estimates place worldwide incidence at over 200 million symptomatic cases per year.
Of concern, up to 20% of giardiasis cases are resistant to front-line clinical treatments, and resistance to all major
antigiardial drugs has been reported. In addition to their increasing lack of effectiveness, front-line and second-
line nitro drugs act intracellularly via non-specific free radical generation, and therefore have a high incidence of
negative side effects. There is a critical need to better understand the basic biology of the parasite in order to
ultimately design improved intervention and treatment strategies. Flagellated trophozoites proliferate to colonize
the intestine where cues including cholesterol starvation and increased pH at the end of the intestinal tract
promote terminal differentiation into cysts that detach for transmission. While current treatments target the
flagellated trophozoites, encystation could be exploited to clear Giardia infections. The regulation of encystation
is poorly understood across the diversity of encysting parasites; thus, studies focused on the encystation
pathway are of fundamental cell and developmental biology interest, as well as profound clinical relevance.
 The aim of this proposal is to understand how encystation cues are perceived and transduced to initiate the
encystation program. Our preliminary studies indicate that elevated cAMP is necessary to activate encystation.
Our preliminary studies identified a role for Giardia’s sole Rho family GTPase, GlRac, in the regulation of
cAMP. Protein-protein interaction studies with GlRac identified a previously uncharacterized seven-
transmembrane PQ-loop protein that belongs to the TOG (transporter/opsin/GPCR) superfamily. Knockdown of
this protein results in increased encystation indicating that it negatively regulates encystation. We named this
protein EncystR for its role in encystation. EncystR localizes to the plasma membrane in actively growing cells,
but exposure to encystation stimuli (high pH and cholesterol depletion), causes rapid internalization. EncystR
internalization requires GlRac, supporting a functional relationship between these proteins. EncystR negatively
regulates encystation through control of cAMP levels, but the mechanism remains to be determined. Related
PQ loop proteins are multi-function amino acid transporter-receptors that are known to be pH responsive and
can regulate development. EncystR is an exciting new entry point into uncovering the regulation of Giardia’s
developmental program.
 The overall goal of this project is to delineate the roles of EncystR and GlRac in regulating cAMP and
the role of cAMP in eliciting the encystation program. This work will establish a framework for understanding
the regulation of encystation from signal detection to encystation. Ultimately, we aim to identify the means to
short circuit the normal encystation program such that cell cycle arrest and cytoskeletal disassembly can be
activated without producing a protective cyst wall. This would clear infections without the risk of transmission."

Digital data that lacks a coherent, stable, discoverable, and reproducible structure is irrelevant to the research
process. Improperly or inadequately documented data files represent meaningless numbers, valueless and,
ultimately, discardable. One of the significant advances over the past 20 years has been the increased use of
descriptive metadata, facilitating the use and value of these data, offering greater discoverability and
preliminary exploration. These changes have been part of an evolving process over the past 50 years, roughly
categorized into four phases 1) The tabular paper phase, 2) The tape and mainframe phase, 3) The CD and
personal computer phase, and 4) The internet distribution phase. This application argues that the broad
adoption of best practices for data management, data sharing, and team science remain stalled in Phase 4.
The phenomenal growth in data resources has made access to individual research data on aging simpler than
ever before. Unfortunately, effective data sharing, even in light of the increased access provided by the
Internet, cannot be fully realized without detailed metadata linkages that describe classes of data that share
related concepts, constructs, and variables across multiple data waves or multiple related studies. This fifth
phase, the interoperability phase, represents the next essential transition to support aging research for
multidisciplinary team science. This application's specific goals will advance data interoperability in emerging
scientific areas, facilitating team science and multidisciplinary research. By organizing independent but related
data collections into a uniform structure, this application's outcomes will accelerate aging research beyond
what is achievable using existing collections that treat independent data collections as unique objects. 1)
Identify- The universe of aging data needs to be formally cataloged and structured at the metadata level. This
process includes variable level information and concepts using a ""Common Data Elements"" (CDE) approach to
create cross-domain XML/DDI templates to unify longitudinal studies across waves. 2) Integrate- Relate these
independent longitudinal studies to each other across health thematics, including Alzheimer's disease and
related dementias (ADRD), cognitions, risks associated with complications associated with COVID 19, and
broader health conditions. 3) Operationalize – Make the data resources and analysis tools available to the
research community and provide ongoing support and training for the interoperability portal. A DDI based
Cross-Domain Integration (CDI) framework will maintain the integrated data collections, integrate the support
services, bibliographic tracking, and social media outreach. The project will provide training and educational
services through conference presentations, workshops, and online webinars."

Advanced single-cell sequencing techniques have enabled us to infer gene regulation at the single-cell level. We
propose to develop computational methods to overcome obstacles for elucidating gene regulation at single-cell
resolution. We ﬁrst present an alignment-based computational framework to integrate single-cell multi-omics
measurements. The alignment-based computational framework can effectively handle the cell type imbalance
problem and is more robust to hyperparameters. Furthermore, we incorporate the integrated single-cell multi-omics
measurements and advanced machine learning algorithms to infer transcriptional regulation, distal regulatory
elements, and post-transcriptional regulation at the single-cell level. We expect to develop computational methods
to better understand gene regulation, which would lay a solid foundation for disease diagnosis, treatment, and
prevention."
10902076,"Project Summary
Dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) has been implicated in many
neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, major depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Many
of the behavioral symptoms of these disorders can be modeled as dysfunctional reinforcement learning (RL)
processes. For example, a failure to optimally balance goal-directed (“model-based”, or MB) and habitual
(“model-free”, or MF) control can explain rumination in OCD. An overarching goal of our research is to inform
the future development of devices that will interact with neural circuits in a principled way to treat neuropsychiatric
disorders. One impediment to this approach is that the neural coding in many of these circuits remains poorly
understood. The aim of the current grant is to investigate the neuronal properties of HPC and PFC, and how
these structures interact with each other.
The HPC-PFC circuit may play an important role for reward-based learning processes that depend on a model
of the environment. The HPC has long been associated with representing a ‘cognitive map’ that encodes the
structure of the environment. It is bidirectionally connected with medial PFC (mPFC), which has been implicated
in reward-based learning and value-based decision-making. Our hypothesis is that the HPC-PFC is critical for MB
RL, via the HPC representing a predictive map of task, and communicating this map to mPFC to allow value inferences
that guide behavior. Our theoretical construct for modeling this process is the successor representation (SR), which
learns a map of the task in parallel with reward contingencies, and then evaluates potential actions by integrating
the predictive map with the learned reward contingencies.
To test this hypothesis, we have developed an abstract foraging task that requires the subject to navigate a
hidden state space to find a reward. To solve this task optimally, the subject must engage in MB RL and develop
an internal map of the state space. This map allows the subject to store the location of the most recent reward
and then correctly select the necessary actions to reach the rewarded location. First, we will record from single
neurons in mPFC and HPC, then record simultaneously from mPFC and the hippocampus to examine how these
regions communicate with each other during MB RL.
Taken together, the results of this proposal will expand our understanding of the roles and interaction of HPC
and PFC in the primate brain. This knowledge will not only inform efforts to improve diagnostic tools in clinical

Over the past three decades, the Jacks laboratory has been a recognized leader in the development and
characterization of genetically engineered mouse models of cancer, among other pre-clinical models.
The laboratory has also studied human cancer specimens and datasets to validate finding from their
experimental systems and to advance discoveries toward clinical translation. While Jacks laboratory has
investigated many cancer types over time, this proposal is focused on models of lung adenocarcinoma
and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. By developing and deploying tools of genetic engineering and
genetic profiling, such as CRISPR-based methods and single-cell analysis, the laboratory has pioneered
new models and analytical approaches that have allowed for a deeper understanding of disease
progression, including interactions between developing tumors and the immune system. This proposal
builds on this foundation at the intersection of cancer biology and technology development to explore in
detail the molecular and cellular aspects of tumor evolution. Single-cell profile methods will be augmented
by spatial transcriptomics to characterize the changes in gene expression—in cancer cells as well as
other cell types within the tumor microenvironment—in situ, rather than in dissociated cells. Genes and
pathways implicated by this analysis will be subjected to functional analysis using organoid-based models
as well as in the autochthonous setting. A second major theme of this proposal is the further exploration
of tumor-immune interactions in lung cancer, which the laboratory has been studying for several years.
Following up on experiments investigating the factors that control T cell activation and dysfunction in the
setting of lung and pancreas cancer development, the laboratory will explore methods to provoke
effective anti-tumor T cell responses as well as an improved response to immunotherapy. These studies
will investigate the nature of the antigens and antigen combinations that induce effective T cell priming
and activation, including through prophylactic and therapeutic vaccinations. Results of these experiments
will inform new therapeutic approaches, including novel cancer vaccine strategies, in human cancer
patients."

 Everett Moding, MD, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Radiation Oncology at Stanford University School of
Medicine. His long-term goal is to use his combined expertise in clinical and research medicine to make important
discoveries in radiation and cancer biology that lead to better treatments for patients with sarcomas. He hopes
to develop a translational research program using analysis of human tumor and blood samples to identify critical
mediators of radiation resistance that can be validated in preclinical models and leveraged to enhance the
efficacy of radiation therapy.
 The goal of this career development award is to provide support and mentorship to enable Dr. Moding to
develop a successful independent research program. The proposal will be carried out under the mentorship of
physician scientists Maximilian Diehn, MD, PhD, an expert in genomicsbased biomarkers, Ash Alizadeh, MD,
PhD, an expert in tumor immunology and transcriptomic analysis tools, and David Kirsch, MD, PhD, a leader in
radiation biology and mouse models. The training plan incorporates formal coursework, seminars, conferences,
and programs along with informal hands-on and practical activities to expand Dr. Moding’s knowledge and
expertise in 1) computational and systems biology, 2) tumor immunology and sarcoma biology, and 3) laboratory
management, mentoring, and grantsmanship.
 Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a diverse group of mesenchymal tumors primarily managed with surgery and
radiation therapy for localized disease. Although half of patients with high risk STS develop metastatic disease
after initial therapy, there are no biomarkers to identify patients at risk of relapse. In addition, up to two-thirds of
patients with STS develop local recurrences after radiation therapy alone, but the underlying genetic alterations
that mediate radiation resistance are unknown. By analyzing tumor and peripheral blood samples collected from
102 patients enrolled on the SU2C-SARC032 phase II clinical trial, this research proposal aims to 1) establish
personalized circulating tumor DNA analysis as a biomarker in patients with STS, 2) build a prognostic model
integrating tumor microenvironment profiling, circulating tumor DNA analysis, and traditional risk factors to
improve prediction of patient outcomes, and 3) use circulating tumor DNA analysis and tumor sequencing to
identify genetic alterations that mediate the response of sarcomas to radiation therapy for rapid functional
validation in novel preclinical platforms. This proposal will lay the groundwork for future prospective randomized
trials using circulating tumor DNA analysis and tumor genomics to enable personalized treatment approaches in
patients with STSs that improve the probability of tumor eradication while minimizing treatment-related toxicity."

There is now unequivocal evidence that the behavioral and cognitive phenotypes associated with
psychiatric disorders are mediated by perturbations to specific brain circuits, i.e. sets of strongly
anatomically and functionally connected brain structures. However, there are currently no
unbiased computational approaches to implicate disease-related circuits, in a brain-wide fashion
and at a high spatial resolution, and then to connect abnormalities in these circuits to specific
patient phenotypes. The main goal of the proposal is to develop and optimize a computational
approach which will make it possible, for the first time and at an unprecedented resolution, to
discover functional brain circuits involved in mental disorders. The proposed approach is based
on synergistic analyses of genetics data, ultra-high-resolution expression and brain-wide
connectome data – available for the same mouse strain, and in a common coordinate system. An
important virtue of the approach is that it is based exclusively on genome- and brain-wide data
and therefore is not biased towards any prior hypothesis about disorders' etiology. We specifically
propose Aim 1. Identify brain circuits and associated cell types primarily affected by genetic
insults in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). We will develop data-driven
computational approaches to identify genetic biases towards anatomically connected functional
brain circuits. Aim 2. Experimentally test the identified circuits in several mouse models of ASD
and SCZ. Functional circuits identified by the computational approach will be tested using two
independent mouse models of ASD and two models of SCZ. The dynamics of the circuits will be
explored using multi-site photometric imaging. Aim 3. Correlate mutation biases towards brain
regions, circuits, and cell types with specific ASD phenotypes. Using extensive and deep
phenotypic human data together with genetic data from the same patient cohorts, we will
correlate mutation biases towards brain cell types and circuits with multiple specific ASD
phenotypes."

In this application for a Stephen I. Katz Early Investigator Research Project Grant, the principal investigator, Dr.
Amanda E. Lyall, proposes a project that will support a new research direction for her career: the transition from
the use of neuroimaging to study psychotic disorders to the investigation of restrictive eating disorders. The over-
arching goal of this application is to comprehensively characterize the impact of restrictive eating disorders on
white matter development. This study will leverage unique access to extant neuroimaging, clinical, blood, and
dietary intake data collected under 4 parent NIMH grant mechanisms (R01MH103402; R01MH108595;
R01MH116205; K23MH125143) at the Eating Disorders Clinical Research Program at Massachusetts General
Hospital, Harvard Medical School. We will use our well-validated diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI)
harmonization framework to combine these data with 2 publicly available dMRI datasets of healthy controls: The
Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and The Human Connectome Project – Young Adult, yielding a cohort
of harmonized imaging data spanning the period of white matter development from ages 9 to 40 years. With
these data, we will examine the trajectories of global and region-specific white matter development using
advanced dMRI analysis tools between healthy controls and individuals with restrictive eating disorders (Aim 1).
Next, we will determine the extent to which age or pubertal stage modifies the relationship between potential
white matter alterations in individuals with restrictive eating disorders and the duration of dietary restriction (Aim
2). Finally, we will evaluate the extent to which total caloric and/or specific nutritional deficiencies that arise
because of severe dietary restriction impact white matter development (Aim 3). We believe that the information
generated within this proposal will provide a critical first step in developing a knowledge base about the impact
of severe dietary restriction on brain development. This proposal will provide an opportunity to identify vulnerable
periods where therapeutic interventions may be necessary or have the most impact. Additionally, the results of
this study may also provide a foundation for future work to test the effectiveness and tolerability of novel
applications of non-invasive individualized therapies centering on improving white matter health."
10897916,"ABSTRACT:
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is among the most lethal and aggressive cancers. Standard of care starts with
surgery, to eliminate most of the tumor mass, followed by a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
to eradicate residual tumor tissue. However, the infiltrating nature of these tumors renders it almost impossible
to resect all of the tumor mass, while preserving eloquent brain tissue. A major challenge with current
chemotherapeutic drugs to treat GBM are their lack of efficient crossing across the brain blood barrier (BBB),
preventing enough drug to reach the tumor area, which often results in recurrence of the tumor. Herein, we
propose to develop a BBB-crossing, glioma cell targeting magnetofluorescent nanoprobe for the image-guided
delivery of drugs across the BBB and into GBM tumors. At the core of our platform technology is Feraheme (FH),
an FDA-approved superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPION). To FH, we conjugate hepthamethine
cyanine (HMC), a unique near infrared fluorescent ligand that specifically targets the organic anion transporter
protein (OATP) overexpressed in various tumors, including GBM microvasculature. HMC’s ability to cross the
BBB and internalize into GBM cancer cells is mediated by the OATP subtypes OATP1A2 and OATP2B. Upon
conjugation of HMC to FH, the resulting HMC-FH nanoprobe has a unique combination of the following
properties: (1) dual magnetic (MRI) and near infrared fluorescent properties, (2) BBB-crossing and specific
glioma targeting ability, with no accumulation in heathy brain, and (3) delivery of drugs across BBB with specific
accumulation in brain tumors, acting as a glioma-specific image-guided delivery nanodrug. Our preliminary
studies show that HMC-FH selectively accumulates in intracranial human GBM tumor xenographs in nude mice,
particularly in in infiltrating areas within the brain. In addition, studies show that HMC-FH crosses the BBB in the
tumor area and associates with the GBM cells within the tumor, facilitating drug delivery and reducing tumor size
in mice when paclitaxel is encapsulated within the HMC-FH. Therefore, we hypothesize that HMC-FH can
facilitate the delivery of drugs across the BBB and into glioma tumor cells, causing tumor remission and
increasing survival in mice with orthotopic intracranial GBM. In addition, biodistribution and tumor uptake studies
will be done in a spontaneous high-grade glioma canine model. To test our hypothesis, the following specific
aims will be pursued: 1) Optimization of drug loading into HMC-FH, 2) Study the mechanism of BBB crossing
and GBM cancer cell internalization of HMC-FH, 3) Investigate HMC-FH biodistribution, tumor uptake, retention
and ability to deliver drugs in an intracranial tumor mouse models using human and canine derived GBM cells,
4) Investigate the biodistribution, tumor uptake and retention of HMC-FH in a canine GBM model"

Existing delivery systems for CRISPR-Cas gene editing machinery have very little capacity for making multigenic
insertions. As such, the scope of existing gene therapies has been limited primarily to monogenic diseases. Yet
multigenic insertions could facilitate treatment of a much broader range of conditions. To address this challenge,
I am developing a chimeric AdAAV gene editing delivery system by physically linking multiple adeno-associated
viruses (AAVs) to the surface of adenovirus (Ad). I am using the SpyTag-SpyCatcher technology for site-specific
covalent conjugation. In my design, the Ad will encode the Cas9 protein and the gRNAs while the AAVs will
provide a single-stranded DNA template. To enable multigenic genetic insertions, I will conjugate a mixture of
AAVs (with distinct genetic cargos) onto the Ads. Each AAV cargo sequence will undergo programmable
insertion into a unique genomic target site via the Cas9 and gRNAs encoded in the Ad. I anticipate that the strong
and targetable transduction of the Ad will efficiently drive the uptake of AdAAV particles into cells. I also anticipate
that greater in vivo gene editing efficiencies may occur using this design because of the known benefits of single-
stranded DNA templates for homology-directed repair (HDR). My fully novel AdAAV vector will act as an
efficacious and versatile platform for multigenic gene therapy. AdAAVs will be particularly suited for treating
aging and aging-related conditions, especially Alzheimer’s disease."

Close to 65 million US adults have a behavioral health condition (BHC), including mental health and substance
use disorders.2 Persons with BHCs have a greater burden of complex health conditions, unmet health-related
social needs (HRSNs) such as nutrition insufficiency and housing insecurity, use more healthcare, and are
more likely to die prematurely.2 Access to mental health, addiction treatment, primary care services, and
connection to social services in the same location is uncommon, even though physical illness, unmet HRSNs,
mental health disorders, and substance use disorders often co-occur.6 Fragmented care is associated with
increased hospital and emergency department visits, higher complication rates, and higher episode costs.30,31
Medicaid is the primary health insurance program for underserved populations in the United States. The main
objectives of many recent Medicaid behavioral health-related policy reforms have been to integrate behavioral
health treatment with primary care and to connect Medicaid members with social services in primary care
settings.2,4,5 6,7,8 In 2018, Massachusetts’ Medicaid program, MassHealth, launched a new Accountable Care
Organization (ACO) delivery and payment system to deliver integrated person-centered care to meet
members’ social, behavioral, and physical health needs by integrating care within and between healthcare and
social service sectors. MassHealth’s shift to this integrated ACO model attempts to provoke improved
healthcare outcomes and decreases in acute and emergency healthcare utilization for Medicaid members,
typically who have a higher prevalence of complex BHCs and HRSNs than the privately insured.2,4,5 13 In this
study, we will examine the effects of healthcare and social service integration on the experiences and
outcomes of MassHealth members with BHCs. We will first analyze data collected from qualitative interviews
among a sample of 36 MassHealth members with BHCs to identify barriers and facilitators to good health,
access to care, and effective care delivery, and to characterize their experiences with the integration of social,
behavioral, and physical health supports.15,16,17-21 We will then conduct a cross-sectional analysis, using survey
and MassHealth administrative data from 2022, to examine the relationship between primary care providers’
perceptions of clinical and social services integration, as measured on the Provider and Staff Perceptions of
Integrated Care survey, and rates of acute and emergency healthcare utilization among MassHealth members
with BHCs from the same clinics.22 Finally, we will use MassHealth administrative data collected between 2020
and 2022 to quantify the effect of receiving integrated housing supports through MassHealth’s Flexible
Services Program on healthcare utilization among MassHealth members with BHCs experiencing housing
insecurity or homelessness.14"

This proposal is a summer research and education program for health professional students in areas related
to the research mission of the NHLBI. Mentored by faculty drawn from selected health professional schools of
Rutgers, the program has three primary aims: (1) to increase student knowledge and appreciation of
biomedical research by providing a closely-mentored, hands-on research experience; (2) to increase student
knowledge and interest in pursuing careers in research in mission-related areas of the NHLBI through career
development and educational activities; (3) to provide continued advice, support and guidance to program
alumni to facilitate post-program career planning and implementation. Ten health professional students from
Rutgers New Jersey Medical School (NJMS), Robert Wood Johnson Medical School (RWJMS), School of
Dental Medicine (SDM) and School of Health Professions (SPH) will be admitted to our program each year
beginning in 2020. Special consideration will be given to students from economically and/or socially
disadvantaged backgrounds, including underrepresented minority applicants and those with limited research
experience. Our selection of participants is enhanced by the proven track record in diversity recruitment as
demonstrated by the ranking of Rutgers NJMS in the 80th percentile in underrepresented minority students and
85th percentile for minority faculty, according to the 2014 Association of American Medical Colleges’ Mission
Management Tool. The research component of the proposed program is aligned with the training program
being implemented in a parallel pending Clinical and Translational Science Award program to Rutgers.
The R25 program will provide hands-on experimentation in labs with active, nationally recognized and funded
research programs at Rutgers in mission areas of the NHLBI, specifically studies related to cardiovascular,
pulmonary and hematological diseases. These students will be exposed to high-level research using cutting-
edge, experimental strategies and contemporary methodology. The infrastructure and organization of the
proposed R25 summer program will take advantage of the leadership, teaching, research knowledge and skills
of faculty who have extensive experience in training health professional students. The program is designed
to integrate student research experiences and mentoring with weekly meetings comprising training in science
communication, critical reading of manuscripts and Responsible Conduct of Research. Each year, students
will present the results of their summer research projects in a symposium and submit a paper on their project
in the format of a manuscript. Contact by program directors with alumni via social network platforms and in-
person reunion events will provide continued career-related advice, mentoring and networking of
prospective, current and past participants who can share their experiences and advise each other."

Emerging evidence has shown that small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) harbor a diversity of RNA modifications.
RNA modifications have the potential to store a secondary layer of labile biological information that is responsive
to various environmental exposures and can modulate RNA properties such as stability and interaction potential,
thus contributing to complex physiological/pathological processes. In our previous mouse model of paternal high-
fat diet (HFD)-induced intergenerational inheritance, we found that tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) and RNA
methylatranserase (Dnmt2)-mediated site-specific RNA modification established a “sperm RNA code” that is
required for intergenerational transmission of paternally acquired metabolic disorders (Science 2016; Nat Cell
Biol 2018). These data, along with others, support an emerging concept that RNA modifications in sperm small
RNAs serve as an additional layer of paternal hereditary information that can be modulated by environmental
input, and is essential for regulating offspring phenotype via embryo development. These advances have set the
stage to further examine whether a wider range of paternal environmental exposures, such as tributyltin (TBT)
and arsenite (both are known to associate with obesity and metabolic disorders) will similarly alter sperm RNAs
to confer offspring phenotype. This concerns the nature of the core sperm RNA code (i.e. a group of modified
tsRNAs) shared by different exposure that is responsible for the intergenerational phenotype transmission; and
also the molecular mechanism by which the modified sperm tsRNAs regulate embryo development to dictate
offspring’s metabolic performance. In present project, we aim to first decipher the essential sperm tsRNAs &
associated RNA modifications that responsible for programming offspring metabolic health, by comparatively
studying different paternal environmental stressors (HFD, TBT & arenite exposure) with improved small RNA-
seq protocol, which reduces sequencing bias by enzymatically removing RNA modifications that block reverse
transcriptase and terminal adaptor ligation; we also explore the upstream regulators of the altered sperm tsRNAs,
with a focus on RNA modifications enzymes (Aim 1). We will further isolate individual tsRNAs followed by RNA
modification quantification using Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and test their
function in conferring offspring phenotype by zygotic RNA injection and offspring phenotype tracking (Aim 2).
Mechanistically, we will test the hypothesis whether modified sperm tsRNAs can program the metabolic state by
regulating ribosome heterogeneity that control distinct translational pool of mRNAs (Aim3). In other words, we
propose that environmental stressor-induced “sperm RNA code” is transformed into an “embryonic ribosome
code”, which generates translational specificity to define the metabolic phenotype of offspring. Data from the
proposed study may not only reveal the nature and mechanism of metabolic disorder related sperm RNA code,
but also generate fundamental knowledge for future therapeutic intervention facing the obesogenic environment."

ABSTRACT
Foodborne bacterial infections have contributed to morbidity and mortality world-wide. To track
antimicrobial resistance in enteric bacteria isolated from retails meat products, National
Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) was established to perform public
health surveillance in the United States. The Maryland Department of Health (MDH) has been a
partner with the NARMS program for numbers of years and has been successfully contributing
to the data development used in the bacterial illness and antimicrobial resistance studies. At
MDH, the project has been performed in collaboration between MDH epidemiologists and MDH
laboratory scientists to assure the quality of the data. Retail meats including ground beef, ground
turkey, pork, chicken and seafoods are purchased from stores across the State of Maryland and
processed according to the protocols established by the NARMS program. The target organisms
from the retail meats include Salmonella, E. coli and Enterococci and Campylobacter whereas
Vibrio, Aeromonas, Enterococcus and lactose fermenting bacteria are isolated from seafood
products. The isolate identification is confirmed with appropriate methods before submitted to
the FDA. Isolates including E. coli, Campylobacter and Salmonella are subjected to whole
genome sequencing and the data are submitted to the FDA. After all isolates are confirmed and
frozen, they are shipped to the FDA for antibiotic susceptibility testing and further
characterization."
10901876,"Abstract
An emerging body of literature has shown that nucleosomes, the fundamental subunit of chromatin,
are destabilized in a broad array of common cancers. This destabilization was previously thought to
require cancer-specific mutations in histone-encoding genes, called “oncohistones”. We identified a
new mechanism by which cancers can acquire unstable nucleosomes, through upregulation of the
nucleosome-poisoning histone H2A variant H2A.B. This variant is normally expressed in testis only,
where it contributes to the unique chromatin environment in sperm. We compared the amino acid
sequences of H2A.B and H2A and identified oncohistone features in the wildtype H2A.B sequence,
suggesting that this is a readymade oncohistone sitting in our genomes. Consistent with this
hypothesis, we identified H2A.B expression in 50% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 5-10% of
many other common malignancies but not in normal tissue outside of testis. We also found unique
patterns of alternative splicing in H2A.B-expressing cancers, and these changes were previously
reported in the context of nucleosome destabilization. Finally, we performed knockdown studies and
found that H2A.B reduction impairs cancer cell growth in several different lymphoma cell lines,
results that are supported by large-scale CRISPR studies. Together, these data substantially expand
the number of cancers that may be driven by oncohistone biology. However, the contribution of
H2A.B to oncogenesis is not known. This proposal will identify the effects of H2A.B on the
transcriptome and epigenome in order to find new vulnerabilities in H2A.B-positive cancers. In aim
1, we employ RNA sequencing to identify changes in gene expression and alternative splicing in
response to induction or reduction of H2A.B. In aim 2 we use chromatin profiling methods
developed in the Henikoff lab to study the impact of H2A.B expression on the epigenome. In aim 3
we use data from aims 1 and 2 to identify vulnerabilities in H2A.B-positive cancers including
investigation of aclarubicin, an anthracycline with similar efficacy but much more favorable side
effect profile than doxorubicin. The experiments in this proposal will elucidate the role of H2A.B in
cancer and identify novel therapeutic vulnerabilities."
10872780,"The long-term goal of the application is to understand how insertion sequences (IS) in bacterial
genomes create heterogeneous subpopulations by amplifying chromosomal segments. IS are short, mobile
DNA elements integrated into bacterial chromosomes and plasmids that encode a transpose flanked by
inverted terminal repeats (ITR). IS activity plays a major role in shaping prokaryotic genomes, where they can
destroy gene function through intragenic transposition, induce expression by juxtaposition of outward facing
promoter elements, remove/rearrange large segments of genomes by recombination events, and tandem
amplify DNA segments intervening between two IS elements. This proposal focuses on the latter process, as it
is the least well understood despite arguably being the most common and effective mechanism for generating
heterogeneous populations. Chromosomal tandem amplification catalyzed by IS elements generally occurs at
much higher frequencies in comparison to point mutations, amplifies intervening segments of DNA that can be
hundreds of kilobases long, and results in head-to-tail tandem copies of DNA segments separated by a third,
hybrid IS element. In genomes with high IS content, amplification thus generates tremendous heterogeneity
and transient single cell individuality that is revertible through subsequent recombination between the amplified
segments. Heterogeneity in bacterial populations helps ensure survival in the event of environmental stress
(including antibiotic treatment) by sampling a larger pool of cells with distinct phenotypes. The connection
between IS element activity, genome amplification, and heterogeneity will be explored in this proposal using a
model system of Escherichia coli B with the element IS1. In the first aim, how genomic IS1 element distribution
impacts frequency of amplification and the requirements for amplification will explored. In the second aim,
genetic and environmental factors will be identified using a Tn-seq assay that has been developed to be
specific for defined IS1-flanked chromosomal amplification events. In the third aim, the contribution of IS1 to
creating distinct lipopolysaccharide compositions and gene expression profiles at the single cell level will be
explored using a paired IS1-less strain. By understanding IS1-induced heterogeneity in a model bacterial
strain, the project will help formulate rationale strategies to mitigate the impact of heterogeneity on
antimicrobial bacterial resistance."

Beta cell dysfunction and death are significant pathologies underlying the development of Type 2 diabetes. Our
long-term goal is to identify molecular mechanisms restrict beta cell function and survival. During the SARS-
CoV2-driven COVID19 pandemic, there are reports of adult COVID19+ patients presenting with diabetic
ketoacidosis in emergency rooms. 25% of new-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients presenting with diabetic
ketoacidosis in the T1D Exchange registry are COVID19+. Our group has reported a significant increase in the
number of new-onset type 2 diabetes patients presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis. This suggests that the
pathogenesis of COVID19 may have acute and specific effects on pancreatic beta cell function. One of the
barriers to understanding how SARS-CoV2 infection may affect beta cell function and survival in patients is the
limited number of physiologically relevant animal models to study. We have capitalized on unique access the
pancreas of SCV2-innoculated animals to model and understand how the infection may affect beta cell function
and survival. Our preliminary data that shows: (1) SARS-CoV2 directly infects beta cells, (2) SARS-CoV2
infection causes dramatic morphological changes in islet, (3) SARS-CoV2 infection shifts beta cell metabolism
to glycolytic profile, and (4) SARS-CoV2 infection results in decreased in beta cell function and survival.
The objective of this proposal is to define the mechanisms that drive the post-acute consequences of
COVID19-mediated beta cell injury in vivo. There is controversy in the literature regarding if SARS-CoV2
directly infects beta cells and affects beta cell function and survival or if the disruption of glucose homeostasis in
patients is secondary. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV2 infection reprograms cellular metabolism and
induces necroptosis, thus leaving hosts susceptible to beta cell dysfunction acutely and as a post-acute
sequelae of COVID19. These highly innovative experiments capitalize on a unique and clinically relevant model
system and employs cutting edge techniques to assess how beta cell survival and metabolism are affected by
SARS-CoV2 infection. These experiments will provide critical mechanistic insight to the underpinnings of the
emerging clinical phenotype of acute hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and potentially lifelong diabetes that
may afflict a significant number of patients who have recovered from COVID19."

Dopamine receptors are the primary therapeutic targets for a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders,
including schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and many other movement disorders. The five subtypes of
dopamine receptors (D1-D5) are members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. This proposal is
focused on the D2 receptor and, in particular, on two novel DRD2 allelic variants that are linked to hyperkinetic
movement disorders. An important distinction between the two variants is that subjects with the mutation
M374R have more severe dysfunction with an earlier onset than those with the mutation I212F. The three aims
will use a variety of approaches to compare and contrast the effects of the two mutations on D2 receptor
function. Our overall goal is to determine which changes to receptor function are pathogenic, and which are
benign or even potentially neuroprotective. D2-I212F exhibits increased constitutive activation of G proteins,
increased sensitivity to low concentrations of agonist, decreased arrestin binding, slow kinetics for regulation of
potassium channels, and inefficient expression. We will determine if the more severe clinical outcome caused
by the M374R mutation is explained by qualitatively similar changes that differ only in magnitude, or if there are
qualitative differences with I212F. In Aim 1 we will assess arrestin binding and G protein activation by the two
novel variants, expanding our characterization to all D2 receptor-activated Gα subtypes and exploring the role
of receptor phosphorylation. In Aim 2 we will carry out in silico studies of receptor activation. In Aim 3 we will
create a knock-in mouse model of heterozygous expression of D2-M374R. We will evaluate the functional
properties of D2-M374R in midbrain dopamine neurons by slice electrophysiology, using first viral expression
of D2-M374R, and then the knock-in mice as they become available. We will also evaluate gait abnormalities in
the knock-in mice, and quantify D2 receptor expression in midbrain and neostriatum. The aims proposed here
will quantify the effect of these novel polymorphisms on the function and expression of the D2 receptor in cells
and in mouse brain and should provide a biological explanation for manifestation of neurological dysfunction in
humans with these variants."

Now in its 27th year, the NIA Demography and Economics of Aging Centers Program has been successful in
accomplishing the main objectives of developing both innovative lines of research and the next generation of
scholars in the demography and economics of aging. The field of aging has expanded rapidly over this period,
and the D&E Centers have played a key role. New areas and new directions have emerged (e.g., population
genetics, biomeasure collection within national population-based surveys), largely as a result of increasing cross-
disciplinary collaborations encouraged by the Centers. The D&E Centers Coordinating Center has been a
keystone in this research infrastructure, promoting synergy and efficiency and maximizing the effectiveness and
impact of the Program overall. This is achieved through the functions of the Coordinating Center, which serves
as the nexus of communication, streamlining information-sharing across the D&E Centers, with NIA, and to the
public.
The Coordinating Center has been housed at the University of Michigan Center on the Demography of Aging
(MiCDA) for nearly the entire history of the Program. This proposal builds on the successful model instituted by
the MiCDA Coordinating Center to create a new independent Coordinating Center, with all the advantage of
established connections, significant substantive expertise, and ready infrastructure on which to build and expand.
The new Coordinating Center will expand its substantive purview to include Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's
Disease Related Dementias (ADRD). To maximize the growth of cross disciplinary research, its mission will also
expand to promote collaborative work between the D&E Centers and other NIA Centers, each with different
mission, cultures, and ethos. A major thrust of effort will be on supporting early career investigators to embark
on collaborations across NIA Centers. Lastly, the Coordinating Center will collaborate with the Population
Reference Bureau (PRB) to produce dissemination materials with broad appeal that are aggregated and
synthesized research findings from the Centers. Partnering with PRB magnifies the impact of the Program
research manifold."

 The University of Kentucky Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) proposes to sustain and
enhance the current KL2 program, currently in its ninth year of National Institutes of Health (NIH) support. By
providing two to three years of release time (75% effort) and research funding support for mentored career
development, the program is designed to accelerate the academic growth for the next generation of leaders in
clinical and translational research (CTR). The program has four programmatic objectives: 1) to provide a
curriculum that meets core training needs of CTR scholars, 2) to support a mentored program of research
training that expedites development of research careers, 3) to support personalized training programs that
expedite CTR career development, and 4) to provide continuous assessment and quality improvement of both
individual scholar career development and overall KL2 program. The program has garnered strong institutional
support; across the nine years, the initial two NIH-supported training slots have been expanded to seven slots
(four NIH-supported, three institutionally supported). The program supports career development of scholars
with research interests that cross the lifespan (prenatal through elderly) and the full spectrum of clinical and
translational science, including translational, clinical, community/policy studies and clinical and translational
research (CTR) methods/processes (e.g., biomedical informatics) focusing on a broad array of health topics.
Scholars and mentors represent a wide range of disciplines and colleges including Medicine, Nursing,
Dentistry, Pharmacy, Health Sciences, Public Health, Education, Engineering and Arts and Sciences. All
program graduates (n=18) remain actively engaged in CTR, have made important contributions to science
through published research and have successfully competed for extramural funding with 14 as principal
investigators. We are requesting renewed NIH support of four KL2 scholar training slots. The training of a
minimum of three additional institutionally sponsored early-career scholars will continue to be fully integrated
with these NIH-supported scholars to sustain a cohort of at least seven scholars. The foundation of the
proposed program will continue to be practical research experiences within multidisciplinary teams guided by
experienced mentors, with a Faculty Oversight Committee monitoring the successful career development of
these future CTR leaders. Educational technology promotes vigorous yet efficient competency training
programs. Further, our enhanced team science training programs will focus specifically on developing
leadership skills. Institutionally sponsored pipeline programs targeting undergraduates, medical students,
residents, fellows and clinical instructors, several focused on underrepresented minorities, will support the
availability of a strong and diverse pool of candidates for the KL2 program. In sum, the KL2 program is
accelerating the career development of future leaders of the biomedical research workforce who are well
prepared to address today’s complex research challenges and spearhead future advances in human health."

An estimated 3.1 million cases of myocarditis/cardiomyopathy were diagnosed in 2017. Patients with myocarditis
are at risk of sudden death from acute heart failure and progression to dilated cardiomyopathy, often
necessitating a heart transplant. The incidence and severity of myocarditis is higher in men than women.
Additionally, there are no disease-specific therapies to reduce myocarditis. Enteroviruses including
coxsackievirus group B3 (CVB3) are a common cause of myocarditis in the US. Viruses are frequently found in
endomyocardial biopsies from patients with myocarditis. There is currently no clear understanding of why an
enterovirus like CVB3 would target the heart or the mechanism for how a relatively mild viral infection like CVB3
leads to heart failure. Previously it was hypothesized that an overwhelming lytic CVB3 infection damages the
heart. It was recently published that the predominant mode of viral egress for CVB3 from cardiomyocytes is in
extracellular vesicle-like mitochondrial autophagosomes, and that CVB3 requires mitochondrial fission for viral
replication. Interestingly, other viruses that cause myocarditis have been found to use mitochondria to promote
viral replication including influenza A, HIV, poliovirus, hepatitis C virus and SARS-CoV-2. The high energy
demands of cardiac muscle and abundant mitochondria in the heart provide for the first time an explanation for
why such disparate types of viruses, with no obvious cardiac tropism, replicate in the heart. The overall goal of
this proposal is to determine whether the CVB3 replicative cycle through mitochondria in cardiomyocytes induces
sex differences in cardiac inflammation during myocarditis and to determine whether microRNA and/or protein
from mitochondrial-derived extracellular vesicles influence viral replication and inflammation in a sex-specific
manner."

 Anxiety disorders are the most common class of psychopathology among youth, with nearly a quarter
of adolescents meeting 12-month diagnostic criteria. There is evidence that anxiety prevention programs can
be effective for youth however, they are not widely available or accessible, particularly among underserved
populations where need is greatest. Novel approaches to increase engagement in and access to interventions
that prevent the development and impact of anxiety disorders among are needed. To address these gaps in
the literature, the goals specific to this grant are to use user-centered design methods to engage at-risk
adolescents, providers, and community partnerships into the iterative design of a technology-enabled
prevention service for anxiety (TEPS-A). We will then conduct a randomized pilot trial on the adapted TEPS-A
prototype. Importantly, the proposed study is designed to complement the training program by helping me to
refine relevant research skills while designing and evaluating a TEPS-A among at-risk youth.
 My goal is to harness digital tools to extend reach of preventive interventions to underserved youth in
community settings, and sustainably deploy and evaluate digital tools for adolescents designed to reduce the
incidence of anxiety and related disorders. A comprehensive training plan was therefore constructed to
systematically advance my: 1) expertise in user-centered design methods, 2) aptitude in community-engaged
research with underserved populations, 3) methodological skills related to designing and deploying preventive
interventions, and 4) proficiency in qualitative and longitudinal data analytics. Accomplishment of the training
goals and proposed research project will provide the skills and tools necessary for development of an R01
proposal aimed at testing the efficacy of the TEPS-A among youth within community settings. Consistent with
the goals of the K01 Award, the research opportunities as well as mentorship on conducting digital mental
health research with youth populations from underserved communities will help me become a successful
independent research scientist in the field of digital mental health."

Genome stability is essential for human health. This is apparent from the multitude of inherited human syndromes
characterized by defective DNA damage responses. The nervous system is particularly prone to the
consequences of genome damage, and most inherited DNA repair deficiency syndromes involve
neurodegeneration, neurodevelopmental disorders or brain tumors. Defective maintenance of genome integrity
is also increasingly being linked to broader neurologic health issues, including age-related neurodegenerative
events that mar cognitive ability and quality of life. Understanding the mechanistic connections between faulty
DNA damage signaling and human disease is therefore of fundamental biomedical importance. Most studies
dealing with genome instability associated neuropathology focus on neuronal loss, such as the impact on
cerebellar granule or Purkinje neurons associated with various spinocerebellar ataxias. However, other features
of genome instability associated neurodegenerative syndromes include white matter defects, resulting from
oligodendrocyte dysfunction. Given the widespread alterations and reduction in white matter in these diseases,
and that most disease-causing gene mutations are ubiquitously expressed throughout the nervous system, it’s
very likely that other glial populations are also affected. For instance, neuroinflammation linked to astrocyte and
microglia activation also characterize certain diseases caused by DNA repair defects. However, direct
mechanistic studies to reconcile the contribution of glia to the pathobiology of genome instability syndromes are
sparse. The experiments proposed in this application will provide key data illuminating the glial DNA damage
response and how glia contribute to disease pathogenesis. We propose leveraging novel mouse models of
neurodegenerative disease with defective DNA damage signaling to determine the critical DNA strand break
repair pathways that support glial cell function in the mammalian brain. Accordingly, we will evaluate the
oligodendrocyte lineage for DNA damage susceptibility to determine how dysfunction in these glia occur in
human genome instability syndromes. Oligodendrocyte responses to DNA damage will also be assessed using
chromatin architecture as a predictor of genotoxic susceptibility. Finally, the impact of DNA damage on microglia
will be explored in a new model of the neuroinflammatory Aicardi Goutières Syndrome resulting from defective
ribonucleotide excision repair. Collectively, these data will provide critical information regarding the central
mechanisms that maintain the glial genome and how genome instability in these cells contribute to disease
pathogenesis. As effective therapeutic intervention for many neurological diseases is becoming possible, it’s
now critical to understand the full spectrum of degenerative changes that occur. Thus, data from this proposal
will provide an important framework for understanding progressive aspects of neurological disease resulting from
genome instability and will inform therapeutic strategies for treatment."
10896245,"Project Summary
 Adipocytes play a critical role in whole body energy homeostasis through secretion of a spectrum of
adipokines. Recent studies show that adipocytes synthesize and release uridine, the most abundant
circulating nucleoside that has a plethora of functions in cells. However, the significance of adipocyte uridine
production in obesity and diabetes progression remains unknown.
 Historically, liver is considered as the major organ for uridine synthesis and plasma supply. Recent
studies show that adipocytes are critical for plasma uridine supply in fasted state, and ER stress potently
stimulates uridine synthesis in adipocytes. Being associated with massive expansion of adipose tissue and
chronic ER stress, obesity is a condition that warrants increased uridine supply from adipose tissue. Indeed,
circulating uridine levels are found elevated in obese mice, however, the contribution of adipocytes and the
significance to insulin resistance is still elusive.
 Preliminary results here show that in response to high fat diet feeding, the mice increase the
concentration of uridine in circulation and the uridine biosynthetic capacity in adipose tissue, but not in liver.
Previous studies indicate that uridine has a dual action on glycemic control. A transient increase in uridine
supply is beneficial for glycemic control, while chronic elevation of uridine level is detrimental. Preliminary data
here show that uridine is a potent insulin secretagogue. Remarkably, the uridine-induced hyper-secretion of
insulin is critically dependent on leptin. In the absence of leptin, uridine is converted from an agonist to an
antagonist in insulin secretion. Given that insulin is a driving force for adipogenesis and lipogenesis, the
increase in uridine promotes hyper-secretion of insulin and systemic hyperinsulinemia. Thereby, obesity
becomes “self-sustaining” through uridine-mediated insulin hyper-secretion. Even though acute elevation of
uridine promotes glucose uptake through insulin secretion, a continuous increase of uridine supply may
diminish insulin response by interfering with cellular insulin signaling pathway through O-GlcNAc protein
modification. Therefore, chronic elevation in uridine may lead to hyperinsulinemia with concurrent insulin
resistance, a key characteristic of obesity-associated prediabetes.
 Based on previous findings and the current preliminary data, increased uridine supply from adipocytes is
hypothesized to promote obesity and diabetes progression. Both gain- and loss-of-function mouse models
have been generated to test 1) the contribution of adipocytes to circulating uridine supply in obesity, 2) the role
of uridine in hyperinsulinemia in obesity. Ex vivo and in vitro experiments will be performed to corroborate the
in vivo tests. Elucidation of the significance of adipocytes to uridine supply and the relevance of uridine to
hyperinsulinemia in obesity will shed light on the etiology of insulin resistance and pave a way for novel, more
effective therapeutic design for type 2 diabetes."

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are implicated in 50% of deaths in developed countries and is thus a major
health concern and we still remain far from a cure. In addition to the traditional risk factors for CVDs, the
influence exerted by gut microbial metabolites on the pathogenesis of CVDs has been recognized only in
recent times. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbe-derived metabolite of dietary
phosphatidylcholine/carnitine is elevated in the circulation of CVD patients and has been associated with
atherosclerosis and CVD progression in rodents and humans. The present grant proposal attempts to define
novel molecular signaling mechanisms mediating the responses of arterial endothelial cells (ECs) to TMAO,
which will provide new insights into the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction and vascular injury associated
with atherosclerosis. Our preliminary results have shown that TMAO induced Nlrp3 inflammasomes have direct
actions on the endothelial cells. Thus TMAO induces both inflammatory and non-inflammatory effects leading
to endothelial dysfunction and ultimately atherosclerosis. These represents novel pathogenic mechanisms of
TMAO beyond inflammation. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that gut microbial metabolites such
as TMAO which are released into the circulation act as endogenous danger signals and induce both
inflammatory and non-inflammatory responses leading to endothelial dysfunction and vascular injury which
consequently manifests into atherogenesis in the arterial wall. To test this hypothesis, we will address how
TMAO induces endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis in in vivo using Nlrp3-/- mice, endothelium-specific
Nlrp3 knockout mice (EC-Nlrp3-/-) and their wild type littermates. We will then investigate the non-inflammatory
effects of TMAO leading to endothelium dependent vasodilation, pyroptosis and DAMPs production both in
vitro and in vivo. Lastly, we will explore the novel molecular signaling pathways mediating TMAO-induced
endothelial exosome release leading to endothelial dysfunction and vascular injury. The proposed studies will
reveal new mechanistic insights of CVD pathogenesis induced by microbial metabolites such as TMAO and will
pave way to the development of clinically relevant, novel therapeutic strategies for treating atherosclerosis and
resulting CVDs."
10896252,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown remarkable oncologic efficacy, but their clinical benefit is limited by
treatment-limiting adverse events. The efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors results from T-cell activation, which also
triggers increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are known to inhibit
hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes, including members of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family, and thereby
increase the exposure and potential for adverse events with co-administered CYP substrates. Since check-
point inhibitors are formulated as monoclonal antibodies that do not directly interact with CYP enzymes or drug
transporters, clinical drug-drug interaction studies were not performed during development. However, the po-
tential for clinically relevant drug-drug interactions with checkpoint inhibitors is supported by studies that have
found increased adverse events during co-administration with CYP substrates, including adverse events spe-
cific to co-administered CYP substrates. These findings suggest that adverse events during checkpoint inhibi-
tor therapy may be, in part, caused by drug-drug interactions that increase the potential for adverse events with
co-administered medications. Discovery of these novel drug-drug interactions will likely inform clinical strate-
gies to reduce adverse events during checkpoint inhibitor therapy and thereby enhance their clinical benefit.
The long-term goal of this research is to identify clinical strategies to manage adverse events during check-
point inhibitor therapy. The research aims of this proposal are (1) to determine the impact of checkpoint inhibi-
tor therapy on the metabolism of CYP probe drugs and the risk for adverse events with CYP substrate drugs
commonly prescribed to cancer patients and (2) to identify associations between pro-inflammatory cytokine
concentrations and CYP probe drug metabolism before and during checkpoint inhibitor therapy. To investigate
these aims, we will conduct a two-phase crossover clinical drug interaction study in which a cocktail containing
probe drugs for six CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A) is adminis-
tered to subjects before and after they initiate checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Metabolic ratios will be calculated
from concentrations of probe drugs and their metabolites to assess potential changes in CYP metabolism.
Changes in CYP metabolic ratios will be incorporated into physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models to
estimate the potential for changes in exposure and adverse events with CYP substrate drugs that are com-
monly prescribed to cancer patients with the potential for serious adverse events (e.g., citalopram, tramadol,
fentanyl). Pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations will be assayed in both study phases to determine poten-
tial associations with CYP probe metabolic ratios. The expected outcomes of this proposal are to establish a
mechanistic understanding of checkpoint inhibitor-mediated drug-drug interactions that will (1) inform clinical
strategies to manage these interactions (e.g., therapeutic substitution to drugs with unaffected metabolic path-
ways) and (2) elucidate cytokine signatures to identify patients at highest risk for these drug interactions."

approximately one quarter of African Americans who earned STEM and Engineering doctoral degrees from
2015-2019, yield more than 17% of bachelor’s degrees, and more than a quarter of all STEM baccalaureate
degrees earned by Black students. As Florida’s only public HBCU, Florida A&M University has a rich tradition in
cultivating African American students from diverse backgrounds with superior academic qualities. While HBCUs
have overperformed in doctoral degrees earned by their graduates, the dearth of underrepresented doctoral
degrees in the sciences remains a problem. This is in part due to underutilization of public Community Colleges.
The Bridges to the Baccalaureate Research Training Program at Florida A&M University (B2B) aims to provide
structured, evidence-based activities to prepare a diverse cohort of community college students to transfer to
and complete a bachelor's degree in biomedical research fields; stimulate interest among UR students across
the campuses of TCC and FAMU to pursue biomedical research-based terminal degrees; and increase the
number of UR students who hold leadership positions in STEM research enterprises. Through an intricately
designed program interwoven with social cognitive career theory and community cultural wealth, B2B
acknowledges and leverages students’ cultural capital, backgrounds and experiences, and their impact on self-
efficacy, science identity, career decision making, everyday actions, and outcomes. The B2B will recruit and
maintain 10 B2B trainees in year 1 and 5 in years 2-5 with a minimum 2.7 GPA, full-time enrollment in the
gateway science courses, and strong research career interest; establish a semi-structured Peer Mentoring
program where Year II B2B trainees are matched with FAMU NCI CaRE2 trainees, and YEAR I B2B trainees to
facilitate topic based and informal mentoring; and facilitate professional development of TCC faculty and
academic advisors to better align advisement with preparation for matriculation into biomedically-related
baccalaureate programs at FAMU. The B2B will provide faculty-mentored research experiences where B2B
trainees produce mini proposals for projects that serve as the basis for mentored research training and use
results from their authentic research experiences to present at regional symposia and national science
conferences. Career development activities, including academic success workshops, professional
development seminars, research seminars, structured and independent activities related to career exploration
in the biomedical sciences, and leadership development trainings will enhance the institutional culture of both
TCC and FAMU. This partnership will be further leveraged to implement an Annual Research Day at TCC
that features presentations from B2B trainees and other students involved in research at TCC and FAMU. Open
to the broader TCC and FAMU campus communities, Research Day will help facilitate learning about biomedical
research related careers and training opportunities."

Postoperative delirium is among the most common complications following elective surgery. Delirium is
associated with prolonged lengths of stay, functional decline, cognitive impairment, higher costs, and higher
mortality. This proposal describes a career development plan that will transform Dr. Mohanty into a patient-
oriented investigator focused on improving the perioperative brain health of every older American undergoing
major surgery. Dr. Mohanty’s proposed project will involve merging the data of more than 35000 patients who
underwent major surgery in a statewide health system with electronic health record (EHR) data from the
Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), a Regional Health Information Exchange. Using this merged
database, the candidate will develop and test a passive predictive model (“digital marker”) for postoperative
delirium risk using routine care EHR data, including unstructured, free text notes, and a machine learning
algorithm. This “digital marker” will then be tested in a pilot randomized clinical trial in preparation for a large
efficacy trial which will evaluate the impact of this scalable “digital marker” on short and long-term cognitive
outcomes.
The proposed career development plan integrates: close mentoring from a multidisciplinary team of senior
scientists; coursework and structured didactics in medical informatics, including advanced analytics, artificial
intelligence, and clinical decision support; implementation science; experiential learning via the conduct of the
proposed research project; and a supportive research environment. This environment includes an
internationally recognized NIH-funded delirium study group, the distinguished Indiana University Center for
Aging Research, the NIA-funded Indiana Alzheimer’s Disease Center, and the NIH-funded Indiana Clinical and
Translational Sciences Institute (CTSI). This career development award will guarantee protected time that will
be necessary to advance the candidate’s career in perioperative brain health. In addition, the award will
provide critical support to collect data for a future R01 efficacy randomized controlled trial."

The control and eventual elimination of malaria in Africa is seriously challenged by drug resistance, in
particular resistance to new artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) regimens. Worrisome signs suggest
that high level resistance to components of ACT is on the way to Africa, a scary prospect, since the bulk of
serious falciparum malaria occurs on this continent. Improved characterization of the extent of resistance and
mechanisms of resistance is of critical importance. We hypothesize that antimalarial drug sensitivity is
changing in Uganda, that resistance to each relevant drug is mediated by specific parasite mutations, that the
rise of resistance will be dampened and obscured by parasite fitness costs, but that continued drug pressure
will allow emergence of highly fit resistant parasites. Preemptive analysis of parasites will be critical to
characterizing resistance mechanisms before the problem is widespread. To test our hypotheses we will
measure the drug sensitivities of parasites freshly isolated from Ugandan patients, including individuals under
varied levels of drug pressure; characterize the genetic profiles of these parasites; and assess the fitness costs
of resistance in both clinical and laboratory settings. We believe that focused evaluations of fresh Ugandan
isolates will best equip us to characterize drug sensitivity and the emergence of high level resistance in Africa,
where the malaria problem is greatest, and where timely characterization of resistance mechanisms can be
most valuable. Our studies will benefit from access to a wealth of clinical studies in Uganda, including trials
studying the treatment and chemoprevention of malaria, surveillance programs collecting samples from sites
around Uganda, and a cohort study following subjects at varied risks of malaria. Our program will also benefit
from our established laboratories for the study of malaria parasites in Uganda. Our specific aims will be: (1) to
longitudinally characterize the ex vivo sensitivity of malaria parasites to ACT components, (2) to characterize
genetic mediators of varied antimalarial drug sensitivity, and (3) to characterize impacts of varied drug
sensitivity on the fitness of malaria parasites. Our overall goal is to better characterize antimalarial drug
sensitivity and resistance determinants before high level resistance becomes widespread, so that monitoring of
these determinants can guide efforts to circumvent the spread of resistance."

10896656,"Core F: Community Research and Engagement Core
ABSTRACT
The Community Research and Engagement Core (Core F) catalyzes and supports high priority HIV research
that requires the direct engagement of individuals in their communities, and engagement of communities and
community organizations to address. Existing gaps in HIV testing coverage, prevention services and care have
been exacerbated by the COVID pandemic. Over a third of all individuals with diagnosed HIV are not receiving
regular care from HIV providers and have unsuppressed virus. The COVID pandemic also revealed the fragile
nature of community perceptions and trust in science and highlighted the importance of developing meaningful
relationships between researchers and the communities we hope to impact. Core F is focused on supporting
investigators addressing these important challenges in HIV prevention, care, and community engagement.
Core F aims are: 1) to build research infrastructure that will provide meaningful support to investigators
conducting community-based HIV research, 2) to identify, engage, mentor, and train new or new-to-HIV
researchers in strategies necessary for effective community-based HIV research, and 3) to strengthen a bi-
directional program of community engagement and communication with the Penn CFAR. To achieve these aims,
Core F provides services to investigators as they develop applications to test interventions to reduce HIV
infections among high risk, uninfected populations as well as those designed to improve viral suppression among
people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). In all its services, Core F places a high priority on assisting early
career and transitional investigators, particularly those from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups.
Significant Core resources are devoted to community engagement initiatives including programmatic support for
the CFAR Community Advisory Board (CAB), coordination with other HIV CABs on campus and developing
opportunities for community members to have input into HIV research topics, design, and implementation
challenges.
Core F will work closely with the Implementation Science Core (as it did with the prior Scientific Working Group
(SWG)) and collaborate with other CFAR Cores to capitalize on research opportunities, avoid duplication of
effort, and maximize efficiencies in services. Core F places high value on inter-CFAR collaborations as a
strategy for maximizing opportunities for mentoring, investigator support, and innovative research. Core F
provides administrative and programmatic support to the National CFAR CAB Coalition (N3C), the CFAR
Social and Behavioral Science Research Network (SBSRN) and coordinates the Penn CFAR’s involvement
in the Mid Atlantic CFAR Consortium (MACC) and MACC Scholars Program. The Core will be led by Dr.

10880455,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Childhood Sjögren's disease (cSD) is a rare autoimmune disease that primarily affects the
glands, leading to salivary and lacrimal gland inflammation that results in reduced function and
dryness symptoms. Active inflammation of the salivary glands is one of the most common
symptoms in children with cSD. Despite the profound impact on affected children and their
families, there is no pediatric-specific clinical trials to inform therapeutic strategies in cSD.
Although symptomatic episodes of inflammation to the glands are critical to evaluate drug
therapies, how to determine whether a patient has experienced a flare is lacking. There are no
widely accepted cSD outcome measures to tell us whether a treatment is effective, especially
with regards to flares involving the glands. New medications have the potential to be safe and
effective treatments for cSD but they must be evaluated in trials. We propose a novel trial
design known as N-of-1 trials to evaluate cSD therapies. N-of-1 trials is a personalized
treatment strategy based on the individual patient's response. The goal of this grant will be to
successfully finalize a rigorous and impactful clinical N-of-1 trial in cSD. We will accomplish
this through three aims. We will develop patient- and parent-driven outcome measures for the
evaluation of glandular inflammation and its flares, and their impact on quality of life and
mental health for cSD clinical trials. The overall approach for this aim is based off frameworks
successfully used previously in pediatric rheumatology. To reach consensus on cSD flare criteria
and to develop patient-important cSD outcome measures, we will review the literature, conduct
interviews, perform online surveys, and plan a final group meeting, of stakeholders including
patients, health professionals, and methodologists. We will prepare and finalize the details for
N-of-1 trials in cSD using two therapies. To accomplish this aim our team will develop a study
protocol with patient involvement on critical steps of the trials such as the final choice of
medications or outcome measures. We will establish a collaborative network of pediatric
rheumatology centers for participation in the N-of-1 trial that we will test as a model for current
and future studies in cSD."
10883621,"EBV-associated lymphomas are a heterogenous group of aggressive B-, T-, and NK- cell malignancies. In these
lymphomas, EBV exists in a latent state where infectious virus is not produced but a limited number of viral
proteins are expressed. One mechanism by which EBV+ lymphomas escape the immune response to EBV is
through the latency I program where only the weakly immunogenic Epstein Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and
non-coding RNAs are expressed. Latency I EBV+ lymphomas include Burkitt lymphoma and many cases of
HIV-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Novel therapies are urgently needed in these subtypes where
the outcome for patients with relapsed disease is dismal (OS<20% in Burkitt lymphoma, for example). In
addition, many of the world’s cases arise in resource limited settings where upfront treatment with high dose
chemotherapy is not feasible. Our approach to this unmet need in EBV+ lymphomas is to use epigenetic
reprogramming to convert latency I tumors to the highly immunogenic latency II or III program, thereby rendering
tumors sensitive to T-cell mediated killing. Using a high-throughput pharmacologic screen, we identified the
hypomethylating agent decitabine as a potent inducer of latency II and latency III antigens in latency I EBV+
lymphomas. Furthermore, we observed that decitabine treatment in latency I tumors sensitizes resistant cells to
killing by allogeneic EBV-specific T-cells, both in-vitro and in-vivo. Based on our preliminary findings, we
hypothesize that epigenetic induction of latency switch in EBV+ lymphoma induces an anti-tumor immune
response capable of eradicating disease through cytotoxic T-cell recognition of latency II/III viral epitopes. In the
current proposal we will develop a rational approach to the use of epigenetic modulation to induce latency
switching and immune mediated cell death in EBV+ lymphomas. We will determine which immune effector cells
are required to eradicate latency switched EBV+ lymphomas including their activation status and function, and
will characterize the predominant viral antigens to which they are responding. We will also explore mechanisms
of potential resistance to decitabine mediated latency-switching and develop therapeutic combination strategies
that maximize the percentage of cells that convert from latency I to latency II/III. Finally, we will establish
therapeutic approaches that enhance the immune destruction of latency switched EBV+ lymphomas.
Collectively, this proposal will accomplish the rational development of an entirely novel approach to the treatment
of latency I EBV+ lymphomas, utilizing epigenetic reprogramming to induce immunogenic viral antigens in
otherwise immunologically silent tumors. This work has implications beyond lymphomas to all EBV+
malignancies with restricted latency."
10883622,"This proposal aims to develop an ultra-high sensitive platform that can map cell and extracellular
vesicle (EV) molecular information at the single particle level, and apply it to profile tumor immune
microenvironment (TIME) for immunotherapy monitoring. This technology can resolve
heterogeneity of biological systems and has the potential to discover robust biomarkers that can
accurately profile status of the body for disease diagnostics. This proposal hypothesizes that
single cell-single EV mapping will provide new molecular information on cell-cell communication
for better understanding of pathological development and disease diagnosis. The goals of this
proposal are threefold: i) development of single EV protein sequencing technology to resolve EV
heterogeneity and discover rare EV subtypes for disease biomarkers, ii) ultra-fast cycling for
multiplexed live cell fluorescence imaging to monitor the changes of cellular phenotypes and
identify multiple immune cell types, and iii) single cell-single EV mapping to discover new
molecular information on cell-cell communication through vesicle secretion. This technology will
allow repeat sampling and monitoring of TIME during the course of immunotherapy and provide
guidance to achieve the best possible patient outcomes.
With the expertise in microfluidics, molecular biology, and machine learning, Jina Ko (the PI of this
proposal) has developed new micro- and nano-technologies for liquid biopsy that can extract
multidimensional molecular data from blood-based biomarkers (e.g. circulating tumor cells, EV).
She has extended her expertise to chemistry, droplet microfluidics, and translational medicine to
develop novel platforms that will serve as a fundamental work to this proposal. She has recently
developed i) ultra-high sensitive single EV profiling technology using droplet digital PCR and ii)
ultra-fast cycling for multiplexed cellular fluorescence imaging. Through this work, Jina has forged
research collaborations within and outside the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard
Medical School at the Wyss Institute and Harvard University. Building upon these achievements,
this work will be executed with a team of world experts in droplet microfluidics and physics
(Weitz), molecular imaging and diagnostics (Weissleder), immunology (Pittet), exosome biology
and neurogenetics (Breakefield), and neurosurgery and oncology (Chiocca) who will provide a full
support on this work. Working with these mentors will allow her to tackle clinically challenging
problems and further develop her career as an independent investigator with the ability to develop
next generation medical diagnostics."
10883625,"ABSTRACT
Sexual and gender minority individuals are more likely to report hazardous drinking and have alcohol use
disorders (AUDs) compared to cisgender and heterosexual people. Emerging adult (aged 18-34) sexual and
gender minorities are at especially high risk for AUDs compared to older adults, with up to 44% meeting AUD
criteria. These trends are concerning, as studies have found that alcohol use increases HIV risk behaviors, and
HIV disproportionately affects emerging adult sexual minority male and transgender (SMMT) individuals. Thus,
it is essential to test interventions for reducing alcohol use among SMMT individuals as a means of preventing
HIV among this vulnerable population. One potential evidence-based method of reducing alcohol use is
motivational interviewing, which incorporates a goal-oriented approach for changing behavior and has been
shown to be effective among various populations in prior literature and the investigators’ pilot research.
However, there are opportunities to use technology to extend the impact of this approach by delivering
messaging to prevent risk behaviors in real time (i.e., outside of intervention sessions). The proposed study will
conduct a 3-arm randomized controlled trial that assesses the efficacy of two interventions as compared to a
control: 1) An 8-week motivational interviewing intervention (TRAC) delivered remotely via cell phones and 2)
TRAC combined with an ecological momentary intervention designed to deliver messages reinforcing drinking
reduction strategies discussed during TRAC sessions when individuals visit risky locations (GeoTRAC). All
participants will also complete monitoring of alcohol use and sexual behavior by completing daily surveys and
twice-daily mobile breathalyzer readings. GeoTRAC will use an existing app developed in the investigators’
ongoing research that uses GPS tracking to determine when individuals visit “risky” locations. Participants will
receive messages upon arrival at these locations reminding them of strategies to address triggers for drinking,
and will also complete mobile surveys and breathalyzer readings when they leave these locations to determine
what alcohol and/or risk behaviors they engaged in. If they reported drinking, they will receive harm reduction
messaging to encourage them to avoid subsequent risk behavior (e.g., unprotected sex). Breathalyzer results
and daily self-reports will be used to assess the primary and secondary outcomes of drinking days,
drinks/drinking day, binge drinking episodes, and HIV risk behaviors, and additional assessments at baseline,
8 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months will evaluate exploratory long-term outcomes. Participants will be recruited
from Kentucky and Connecticut through community-based recruitment and health clinics that serve SMMT
individuals. Overall, there is a strong need to determine optimal methods of reducing alcohol use among
emerging adult SMMT individuals given its relationship to increased HIV risk behaviors. The proposed work will
draw upon the high technological literacy of emerging adults by using mobile phones and will test an innovative
precision medicine approach that offers comprehensive support in reducing hazardous alcohol consumption."

10900103,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Congenital deficiency of plasma clotting factor (F)XI is an autosomal disorder. Whereas some individuals are
asymptomatic (non-bleeders), others have excessive bleeding after injury, primarily at sites with high
fibrinolytic activity (mouth, nose, genitourinary tract) (bleeders). People with similarly reduced FXI have
variable bleeding even within families sharing the same FXI mutation. Clinical assays cannot predict bleeding
risk in FXI-deficient people, leading to under- or over-treatment to prevent bleeds. Moreover, FXI inhibition
strategies are in clinical trials to reduce thrombosis; however, observations of individuals with congenital FXI
deficiency suggest these therapies will incur bleeding risk in some patients, especially in prophylactic use.
Uncovering mechanisms that determine bleeding risk in FXI deficiency and developing methods to predict
bleeding will improve treatment for both bleeding and thrombosis. Our long-term goals are to characterize
mechanisms that promote hemostasis in FXI deficiency, and translate these findings into clinically-accessible
methods to predict bleeding. Using plasmas from two independent cohorts of well-phenotyped people with FXI
deficiency, we developed and validated specialized plasma assays that differentiate FXI-deficient bleeders
from non-bleeders, and discovered that inhibiting the contact pathway in these assays enhances the ability to
identify bleeders. We also integrated computational modeling and in vitro assays to uncover synergy between
FXIa and tissue factor that enhances coagulation. We built on these discoveries with new analyses that
revealed plasma proteins whose levels differed significantly between non-bleeders and bleeders, and a novel
computational workflow for advancing a prediction model. These findings and advances provide important
clues to mechanisms that modify bleeding risk in FXI deficiency, and position us with innovative tools to identify
these mechanisms. The objective of this application is to characterize the determinants and functional impact
of differently present plasma proteins in non-bleeders and bleeders, and use computational methods to
differentiate bleeding risk in FXI deficiency. The central hypothesis of this application is that in FXI deficiency,
differences in plasma composition modify thrombin generation and clot formation, structure, and stability and
determine the bleeding risk. Specific aims of this application are to: 1) Determine the functional impact and
mechanisms differentiating differently present proteins in FXI-deficient non-bleeders and bleeders, 2) Use
computational modeling and machine learning to identify predictive features that differentiate FXI-deficient non-
bleeders and bleeders, and 3) Use multi-omic methods to define FXI deficiency and the bleeding phenotype.
This proposed research is significant because the experiments will reveal molecular mechanisms that modify
hemostatic potential in a predictive functional assay and in individuals with reduced FXI. Successful completion
of this work will reveal new biology and lead to novel methods for predicting bleeding risk in individuals with
congenital FXI deficiency and pharmacologically-reduced FXI for thrombosis prevention."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) in mid-life is a significant, independent predictor of late-life dementia, particularly
vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) that includes the common subtype cerebral amyloid
angiopathy (CAA) characterized by deposits of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the cerebral vasculature. In only one decade,
from 2005-2014, the rate of alcohol binging among the elderly rose 20% overall and by 50% in women only. The
mechanisms underlying alcohol’s toxic effects on the central nervous system (CNS) remain incompletely
understood, which limits the development of strategies targeted to reduce or prevent disease burden in heavy
drinkers with and without CAA VCID. An underlying cause of alcohol’s damaging effects on the CNS is a poorly
understood dysregulation of CNS fluid homeostasis. Preliminary evidence indicates that alcohol-associated
abnormal fluid homeostasis manifests as enlarged cerebral ventricles and altered CSF flow dynamics. In
humans, specifically, this manifests as lateral ventricular enlargement, and may reflect not only tissue loss but
also itself be contributing to tissue damage and cognitive impairment. We propose that ethanol disrupts
fundamentals of fluid homeostasis, by reducing CSF flow through the interconnected glymphatic and lymphatic
systems, through biochemical and neuroimmune alterations thereby directly damaging the tissue. The
functioning of glymphatic/lymphatic system supports fluid homeostasis and clears waste and toxins from the
brain. Our proposed studies include a comprehensive series of experiments to quantitatively analyze alcohol’s
effects on CSF secretion, glymphatic and lymphatic transport, and CSF/lymph ‘omics’ profiling in normal brain
and with CAA VCID pathology. In Aim 1, we will determine how cEtoh interferes with CSF secretion in rats
with/without VCID, using a novel MRI acquisition method to measure choroidal CSF secretion, as well as blood
perfusion of the choroid plexus and cortex. We will also implement MRI sequences to measure brain
morphometry in cEtoh-exposed rats with/without VCID and sample CSF, the meninges, and brain tissue to study
pathology and biochemical lymphatic and inflammatory factors. In Aim 2, we will assess how cEtoh affects
glymphatic-lymphatic transport, cerebral and meningeal lymphatic pathology, lymphatic waste output and
cognition in rats with/without VCID. We will use dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and computational fluid
dynamics to measure CSF flow dynamics, glymphatic transport, and lymphatic waste drainage as affected by
cEtoh and VCID, as well on CAA pathology and cognitive decline. In Aim 3 we will study how cEtoh compromises
biochemical signaling and bio-physical changes in the CSF and lymph, including proteins that regulate fluid
volume (renin-angiotensin) and proteins functioning in ion transport/signaling (Voltage dependent calcium signal,
V-type proton ATPase and Carbonic Anhydrase). Molecular pathways that we identify can later be probed for
therapeutic benefit."
10895321,"SUMMARY
High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) frequently harbors defects in DNA repair pathways that confer
homologous recombination (HR) repair deficiency, as well as compromised stability of stalled DNA replication
forks. Such defects frequently involve BRCA alterations and confer sensitivity to inhibitors of poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. These agents have now entered the routine HGSOC armamentarium both in the
advanced and maintenance settings. An overarching objective of this project is to address the emerging problem
of PARP inhibitor resistance that will assume greater importance as PARP inhibitor use increases. The project
focuses on inhibition of Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) as a strategy designed to reverse the two
major mechanisms of acquired PARP inhibitor resistance, including restoration of HR repair and stabilization of
DNA replication forks. Three Specific Aims are proposed. In Aim 1, we will assess the activity and mechanisms
of the ATR inhibitor AZD6738 as monotherapy and in combination the PARP inhibitor olaparib in in vitro and in
vivo BRCA-mutated cell line, organoid culture and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of HGSOC with
acquired PARP inhibitor resistance. This work will prepare the way for a clinical trial in Aim 2 combining AZD6738
and olaparib with a schedule that maximizes ATR inhibition in patients with PARP inhibitor-resistant BRCA-
mutated HGSOC. Once the maximum tolerated doses are established, we will confirm tolerability and assess
preliminary antitumor activity in an expansion cohort of twelve patients. Paired biopsies will be procured for
proof-of-mechanism pharmacodynamic studies in which HR is assessed with an immunohistochemical RAD51
assay and replication fork stability is assessed with a DNA fiber assay in organoid cultures. In Aim 3, we will
determine the activity of ATR inhibition alone and in combination with gemcitabine in HGSOCs with a high degree
of replication stress but are intrinsically unresponsive to PARP inhibition. AZD6738 and gemcitabine will be
studied in cell line, organoid and PDX models harboring high-level CCNE1 or MYC amplification. We will analyze
replication stress in these models and its exacerbation by ATR inhibition and gemcitabine using
immunohistochemical, cytological and gene expression signature biomarkers of ATR pathway activation. Lastly,
we will leverage a recently completed study of gemcitabine vs. gemcitabine combined with the ATR inhibitor
M6620 in platinum-resistant HGSOC patients, in which the combination was superior among patients with a
platinum-free interval of less than 3 months. We will test the hypothesis that this group was enriched with tumors
carrying a high degree of replicative stress, defined by CCNE1 or MYC amplification, as well as by biomarkers
developed in the preclinical models. Taken together, these aims will allow us to establish a role for ATR inhibition
in the HGSOC armamentarium, identify new therapeutic avenues for HGSOC populations with poor prognosis
and provide insights into the biology of PARP inhibitor resistance."

Although epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is initially a chemosensitive disease, it is infrequently cured by
standard-of-care (SOC) platinum-based chemotherapy. Given the abundant evidence indicating that ovarian
tumors are immunogenic, several immunotherapy approaches have been previously evaluated in this disease
but without evidence of potent anti-tumor immunity or clinical activity. Immune checkpoint blockade (CPB)
therapy, which has revolutionized treatment of multiple cancers, has demonstrated only modest effectiveness in
EOC, highlighting the urgent need of new strategies to extend the benefit of CPB in this disease. Over recent
years, we have developed new computational tools to identify immunogenic candidate patient-specific mutated
epitopes (also called neoantigens) that are capable of stimulating tumor-specific T cell responses. Advances in
prediction algorithms generated by our team now provide opportunities for studying the feasibility of generating
neoantigen vaccines in tumors with intermediate mutation load (Abelin Immunity 2017), such as EOC, and for
the testing of how the vaccine can be administered in conjunction with SOC therapy. This promising activity has
led us to prospectively test the targeting of personal neopeptides as cancer vaccines, and we have demonstrated
the safety, feasibility and immunologic activity of immunizing patients with advanced melanoma (Ott, Nature
2017) and glioblastoma (Keskin, Nature 2019) with personal vaccines consisting of up to 20 mutated epitopes
per patient, delivered as synthetic long peptides (20-30mers) admixed with the potent immune adjuvant poly-
ICLC, a TLR3 agonist (called ‘Neovax’). In these proof-of-concept studies, some of the induced neoantigen-
specific T cell responses could recognize autologous tumor cells. Moreover, complete responses with sustained
remissions were observed in patients when anti-PD1 therapy was administered in addition to neoantigen
vaccine. Based on these promising results, we now propose to evaluate, in a new clinical trial, the combined
administration of personal neoantigen-targeted cancer vaccines together with CPB therapy for low residual
volume EOC. We hypothesize that this approach will effectively expand existing tumor-reactive T-cells and
broaden the T-cell repertoire to include new tumor-specific T-cells and thereby generating highly specific anti-
tumor immunity with fewer autoimmune side effects. We will evaluate the feasibility and safety of Neovax in
combination with nivolumab in EOC (Aim 1). Through integrated characterization of circulating blood immune
responses with in situ changes in the tumor and tumor-infiltrating immune cells at serial time points across the
course of therapy, including in the event of disease progression, we seek to elucidate candidate mechanisms of
response and non-response to vaccine and CPB therapy (Aims 2 and 3)."
10895326,"Project 3: Project Summary
Epithelial ovarian cancer is comprised of several subtypes differentiated by histology and molecular composition,
with varying levels of platinum sensitivity based on specific histology. High grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is
the most common and is sensitive to platinum drugs and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.
However, with subsequent exposure to treatment, recurrent HGSC becomes increasingly platinum and PARP
inhibitor resistant. Additionally, other histologic subtypes such as low grade serous and mucinous ovarian
cancers, sometimes RAS mutated, often display platinum resistance at initial diagnosis, and new treatment
strategies are needed for these patients whose cancers are either RAS mutated or RAS wild-type. The overall
objective of this proposal is to investigate the clinical efficacy of a combination therapy targeting the Ras-ERK
pathway serine threonine kinase MEK and two anti-apoptotic proteins, BCL2 and BCLXL. Based on evidence
that the RAS-ERK pathway is activated in a large percentage of ovarian cancers and evidence of efficacy of
combined MEK- BCL-2/XL inhibition in (1) preclinical PDX models of chemoresistant high grade serous ovarian
cancer (HGSC), (2) preclinical studies showing efficacy of combined MEK and BCL-2/XL inhibition in Ras mutant
tumors, and (3) a Phase 1 clinical trial showing safety and tolerability of combined treatment with trametinib
(MEK inhibitor) and navitoclax (BCL-2/XL inhibitor), we hypothesize that combination MEK and BCL-2/XL
inhibition will have activity in refractory/relapsed ovarian cancer. To test this hypothesis, we will carry out a
phase II clinical trial to test the efficacy of combined treatment with trametinib and navitoclax in recurrent
platinum-resistant and refractory HGSOC and low grade serous cancer in addition to ovarian cancers harboring
alterations in Ras and Raf pathway genes. An active and ongoing study, Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center
(DF/HCC) Protocol 13-505 (CTEP 9525 supported by U01CA062490, NCT02079740) is a phase 1 study that
has tested the combination of the oral MEK inhibitor trametinib with the oral BCL-2 XL inhibitor navitoclax. This
trial has been open to accrual since March 2014, has tested different dose schedules, and has established a
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). This RP2D from CTEP 9525 will be used in our Phase II study, proposed
in this project, and is entitled “A Phase 2 study of combination trametinib and navitoclax in recurrent ovarian
cancer.” We will investigate genetic and proteomic markers that correlate with efficacy. In addition, we will
investigate therapeutic approaches to enhance the efficacy of this combination in pre-clinical studies.
These studies promise to provide information critical to the identification of a new therapeutic strategy to treat
resistant ovarian cancers, which if effective, could potentially extend the lives of patients with recurrent ovarian
cancer."

10873387,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Stem cells are required for tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Accomplishing these tasks often requires
intimate association between stem cells and their niche, where stem cells efficiently receive critical niche-
derived signals within specialized tissue compartments. These niches are formed by cells that often must
migrate during organogenesis to attain their appropriate position, yet how this morphogenesis is achieved is
unclear. The broad objective of this application is to define – using powerful genetics and incisive optogenetic
approaches in an accessible undergraduate model system – the molecular mechanisms dictating embryonic
establishment of the Drosophila male testis niche. Results from this work will reveal the cellular dynamics and
molecular mechanisms required to assemble a functional model stem cell niche, which are likely to be
applicable to the numerous other stem-cell based tissues. Our previous work showed that Slit and FGF signals
from adjacent visceral muscle are required to assemble the testis niche. In response to these signals, niche
cells express the transcription factor islet, which is required for F-actin polarization and movement to the gonad
anterior. In Aim 1, we will examine key signaling intermediaries required to induce islet expression in response
to gonad extrinsic signaling. In Aim 2, we will define downstream mechanisms that mediate islet function and
pursue predicted islet targets expressed in niche cells. Using an optogenetic approach during in vivo live
imaging, we will also investigate niche cell behaviors reliant upon mechanisms regulating the F-actin
cytoskeleton. In Aim 3, we will identify how niche-extrinsic signaling from another tissue within the gonad
positions the forming niche. Concepts we elucidate will have broad applicability to studying normal
development, promoting success of stem cell replacement therapies, and revealing mechanisms by which
cancer cells often shape their unique tumor microenvironments. Furthermore, funding from this proposal will
support infrastructure at a large regional public university where we will employ a tractable model system that
provides high-impact biomedical research experiences to underserved undergraduates in a supportive training
environment."

The cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling cell cycle entry and plasma cell differentiation remain poorly
understood. One key facet to this problem is how naïve B cells achieve a state of readiness for the plasma cell
(PC) fate. This project strives to understand the molecular mechanisms whereby activation of the Notch pathway
in naïve B cells fosters biochemical events that accelerate both mitosis and PC differentiation. Further, this
project addresses whether these processes will amplify B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 immunogens. One
major hurdle to vaccine development for complex pathogens are facilitating diverse and durable antibody
responses that can keep up with rapid mutations and stand the test of time. As such, understanding the
mechanisms that underlie optimal B cell responses are vital to improve vaccine design. One distinctive B cell
subset, marginal zone (MZ) B cells, exhibit a selective advantage at generating effector responses. Residing in
the marginal sinus of the spleen at the interface between incoming blood supply and lymphoid follicles, this
innate-like subset responds to blood-borne antigens, serving as a first line of defense to generate antibody-
secreting PCs in a matter of hours. Unlike conventional follicular (FO) B cells, MZ B cells have a distinctive
requirement for the signal Notch2, an evolutionarily conserved transmembrane receptor family member that
dictates cell fate decisions. Notch2 is known to drive lineage commitment of the MZ B cell pool during
development, but how this signal is used continuously to maintain mature MZ B cells is poorly understood. As
such, it is reasonable to speculate that Notch2 signaling instructs a constitutively poised state in resting B cells
by modifying activation requirements and differentiative events. Indeed, preliminary data demonstrate the
induction of Notch2 signaling in non-poised FO B cells enhances their responsiveness to antigen receptor or
TLR signals to promote their proliferation and differentiation into PCs. The central hypothesis of this proposal is
that Notch2 independently augments PC differentiation and cell division, both features which hold potential to
amplify vaccine responses. Herein, this proposal will independently interrogate the mechanism(s) by which
Notch2 modifies proliferative and differentiative potentials in aim 1, and the potential for Notch2 signals to
improve SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses in aim 2. The significance of investigating how Notch2 regulates B
cell responses is twofold. For one, this proposal will challenge the current understanding of Notch2 as a
determinant of cell fate decisions, elucidating how this signal is tied to activation and effector programs.
Additionally, this proposal can better inform vaccination strategies using Notch2 signaling as a tool to enhance
the frequency and diversity of a given antibody response."

Collagen lays the foundation of bodily tissues, serving to strengthen, connect, and signal from the micro to the
macro scale. The importance of collagen in cancer biology has been well-established: its functions in regulation
of the tumor microenvironment—from increased stiffness of the extracellular matrix to dysregulation of cancer
cell signaling—influence tumor proliferation and impenetrability. Key to these effects is the interaction between
fibrillar collagens and the discoidin domain receptor type 2 (DDR2), a receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in
multiple human cancers. Extracellular binding of fibrillar collagen to DDR2 transduces a cell signal that activates
epithelial to mesenchymal transition, proliferation, and metastasis. This work seeks to develop synthetic collagen
mimetic peptides (CMPs) for interrogation of the collagen-DDR2 interaction. As a permutated, triple helical
polymer involved in biochemical signaling, collagen has potential for manipulation as a tool for modulating
protein-protein interactions. These applications have been limited by its tripartite nature, which restricts its
thermal and entropic stability. Synthetic linkage and cyclization of the three collagen strands may overcome
these limitations. To this end, this work focuses on the design, synthesis, biophysical/structural characterization,
and biological application of linked and cyclic CMPs targeted against DDR2 through a chemical biology approach
described within two Aims. Aim 1 will evaluate the impact of strategic design strategies on the thermal and
proteolytic stability of the proposed CMPs, with a goal of maximizing stability. Aim 2 will investigate the ability of
the CMPs to interact with DDR2 in vitro and modulate DDR2 signaling in cellulo. Prior work has established a
method for synthesis of macrocyclic CMPs by solid phase peptide synthesis with on-resin cyclization, and
demonstrated that photoreaction of CMPs using diazirine-based photocrosslinking reagents can be used to
prepare unimolecular collagen heterotrimers. Several linked/cyclic as well as linear DDR2-targeted CMPs have
already been synthesized and have demonstrated appropriate thermal stability as well as capacity to interact
with DDR2. Methods include organic synthesis, photoreaction, circular dichroism, collagenase assay, isothermal
calorimetry, X-ray crystallography, and mammalian cell work coupled with Western blot. This work endeavors to
develop biochemical tools for modulation of the collagen interactome—concentrating on the cancer-implicated
interaction between collagen and DDR2—via an innovative chemical biology approach, laying the foundation for
new discoveries surrounding the role of collagen in cancer biology with potential for applications in drug
discovery. The robust, collaborative training environment at the University of Pennsylvania’s Department of
Chemistry and Perelman School of Medicine’s Medical Scientist Training Program—as well as a skilled
sponsorship team with expertise in organic synthesis, collagen structure and function, receptor tyrosine kinases,
crystallography, and cell biology—will support completion of the proposed fellowship work and facilitate the
rigorous training of an independent physician-scientist investigator."
10900502,"Project Abstract
The mammalian genome is organized into various regions at different scales as one mechanism to regulate
gene expression and mediate cellular identity. One type of well-characterized region is the lamina-associated
domain (LAD), which contains areas of chromatin that directly interact with the nuclear lamina (NL) at the nuclear
periphery. Found across all chromosomes, LADs dynamically interact with the NL to release or attach genes and
regulatory elements in accordance with cell-type and differentiation state-specific gene expression programs.
Patients with mutations in LMNA, encoding the A and C type lamins in the NL, develop a heterogenous group of
diseases, known as laminopathies. Laminopathies preferentially affect striated muscle, and patients often
develop dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which can be fatal. Evidence from mouse models and human genetic
studies of laminopathies have suggested a potential role for the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton
(LINC) complex in mediating the disease phenotype. Abrogation of the LINC complex in a laminopathy mouse
model resulted in a phenotypic rescue. Additionally, characterization of LMNA mutations in various cell types
demonstrated a disruption to chromatin-lamina interactions in a cardiomyocyte-specific manner. This suggests
a mechanism where the nuclear lamina and LINC complex are each playing a role in the pathogenesis of
laminopathy phenotypes, and potentially affecting genome organization. However, while a LINC-LMNA-gene
positioning axis has been previously suggested, the mechanism of how this may occur remains elusive. Using a
combination of population-based genomics analyses, single-cell microscopy, and cellular functional assays, I
will test the hypothesis that cytoskeletal-nuclear interactions in lamin variant cardiomyocytes destabilize LADs
and contribute to abnormal cellular function. I aim to define the role of the LINC complex in mediating chromatin
organization in LMNA mutant cardiomyocytes and will determine if disruption of LINC complex components can
preserve the changes to genome organization observed. In addition, I aim to determine how cardiomyocyte
function is affected by disruption of the LINC complex in the presence and absence of LMNA mutations. These
studies will provide mechanistic insights into how the nuclear lamina and LINC complex are contributing to both
LAD organization and cardiomyocyte function, which will begin to provide novel understanding of the molecular
basis of laminopathy phenotypes."
10903817,"Project summary: Alcohol remains one of the most frequently used intoxicant in the United
States especially among young individuals (1). There is ample evidence that binge alcohol
consumption can lead to life-threatening adverse cardiovascular events (2,3). We have recently
shown that binge alcohol drinking in a mouse model is associated with the activation of
cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1) signaling by endocannabinoids, which plays a critical role in
the development of binge alcohol intoxication-induced cardiovascular dysfunction. (Paloczi et al.,
accepted for publication, J Am Coll Cardiol Basic Trans Science). Activation of CB1 receptors by
endocannabinoids or their plant-derived or synthetic analogs has a robust impact on
cardiovascular functions, as reflected in abnormalities in cardiac inotropy, chronotropy,
conduction and vascular tone (reviewed in 4,5). Therefore, elaborating the role of the gut-heart
axis in the activation of the endocannabinoid system by acute alcohol intoxication may hold great
translational value. The overarching aim of this proposal is to identify the cellular source of
endocannabinoids and the cellular mechanisms of CB1 receptor activation in the heart and
vasculature following binge alcohol drinking. To this end, I propose three specific aims:
Specific aim 1: To determine the cellular source of endocannabinoids in the myocardium following
alcohol exposure in vitro and potential changes in CB1 expression in various myocardial cell
types. Specific aim 2: To uncover the role of gut-heart axis in binge alcohol drinking in vivo and
characterize if acute alcohol-induced gut injury is involved in cardiac anandamide production that
ultimately leads to alterations in left ventricular function. Specific aim 3: To investigate the impact
of binge alcohol drinking-induced gut injury on vascular endocannabinoid production in vivo and
the consequent vascular dysfunction. The anandamide-driven vasodilatation in different types of
vessels will also be characterized ex vivo.
I have been interested in the cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology for many years. As
I continue my training, I’m sure my mentor, Dr. Pal Pacher will challenge me to continuously
improve as a scientist. To further facilitate the achievement of the outlined goals, Drs. Kunos,
Cinar and Ungvari, three researchers with expertise in the field of my studies have agreed to be
members of my advisory committee. Therefore, I am confident that with the support of my mentor,
my intra-, and extramural advisory committee, and the institutional support of the NIAAA, I will be
able to execute the proposed experiments, and succeed as an independent scientist in the field
of cardiovascular alcohol research."

Background: Worldwide, the majority of people with depression receive no treatment, despite the existence of
evidence-based, low-cost treatments. In Zimbabwe, at least a third of people presenting to primary care screen
positive for depression, but most cases go unrecognized and untreated. Research strategy: This study
includes the development and pilot testing of an implementation strategy to improve uptake of clinical
guidelines for depression diagnosis and treatment in primary care. It has three phases: 1) Assessment of
current practice: In a sample of patients presenting to routine primary care (n=200), determine what percent of
patients with probable depression are recognized by primary care nurses and offered treatment, 2) Adaptation
of an implementation strategy: Using a human-centered design (HCD) approach, conduct qualitative interviews
and hold focus groups with nurses to iteratively adapt a implementation strategy that combines in-person
practice facilitation with mobile phone-based clinical supervision, 3) Pilot trial of the implementation strategy: In
order to evaluate whether the implementation strategy is feasible and acceptable and to inform a future cluster
randomized trial of the strategy, pilot test the strategy in two clinics (n=12 nurses, n=30 patients), comparing
outcomes to two control clinics (n=12 nurses, n=30 patients). Outcomes include a) feasibility and acceptability
of the implementation strategy (qualitative interviews, surveys, and program data), b) exploratory
implementation outcomes (e.g. depression screening, recognition, treatment receipt), c) exploratory clinical
outcomes: PHQ-9 score of patients at 6 and 12 weeks after initial visit, and d) feasibility of data collection
strategy. Training plan: To conduct the proposed research and transition to being an independent
investigator, Dr. Jack will receive mentorship and training in the following areas: 1) foundational understanding
of methods for the design and analysis of clustered clinical trials, 2) implementation science with a focus on
mixed methods, and 3) human-centered design. Mentorship: Dr. Jack’s primary mentor (Rao) brings expertise
in implementation science and global mental health in primary care, which is complemented by her co-mentors
who are experts in depression research in Zimbabwe (Chibanda) and mental health treatment guidelines and
clinical trials in low and middle income-countries (Thornicroft). She also has a scientific advisory team (Dorsey,
Hallgren, and Lyon) who will support her training and research in implementation science, clustered trial
design, and HCD, respectively. Candidate: Dr. Jack combines clinical training in Internal Medicine with a
research background that has focused on global mental health and the integration of behavioral health into
primary care (42 publications, 15 as first author). This K23 builds on her eight years of prior research in
Zimbabwe and will allow her the dedicated time for research and training required to become an independent,
NIH-funded investigator in implementation science to address the behavioral health treatment gap worldwide."

Cancer has claimed over 600,000 lives in 2020 in the United States. A better understanding of the mechanisms
underlying cancer progression has led to the development of early detection strategies and novel treatment
modalities that have contributed to the decrease in cancer-related deaths observed for the past few decades.
Yet, cancer remains a deadly disease. There is thus an acute need to identify new cancer vulnerabilities. This
will require exploring understudied aspects of cancers, which requires the development of novel technologies.
One understudied aspect of cancer is the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM is a complex meshwork of
proteins providing architectural support and biochemical signals critical for cellular functions required for tumor
progression. Overcoming technical challenges posed by largely insoluble ECM proteins, we previously devised
a proteomic pipeline specifically geared towards ECM proteins and showed that the tumor ECM is composed of
200+ distinct proteins. We further identified ECM signatures predictive of patient outcome and novel ECM
proteins playing functional roles in cancer progression. The ECM thus represents an important reservoir of
potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. However, the ECM has many more secrets to reveal.
For example, ECM proteins exist in various isoforms and are extensively post-translationally modified, yet, we
do not know which proteoforms are present in the tumor ECM. ECM protein structure and the architecture of the
ECM meshwork is key to mediate function, yet, very little is known about ECM protein folding and its impact on
protein functions. Since proteomics relies on the generation of peptides from protein via proteolysis and protein
identification via database search, we propose that enhancing these steps will provide a more complete picture
of the cancer ECM and significantly advance cancer research. Here, we propose to use in-silico modeling to
define the optimal cleavage conditions to achieve near-complete coverage of ECM protein sequences (Aim 1).
Standard proteomic protocols rely on protein denaturation prior to protein digestion. Yet, we know that many
ECM functions are governed by its architecture. We thus propose to perform native ECM digestion to gain
insights into the structure of individual proteins, and the secondary and tertiary structures of the ECM meshwork
(Aim 2). To facilitate ECM research, we have previously developed a searchable database, MatrisomeDB,
compiling ECM proteomic dataset. Here, we propose to enhance the content and functionalities of MatrisomeDB
to include our new prediction model and a new tool to the visualize sequence coverage on 3D models of ECM
proteins predicted by Google’s AlphaFold (Aim 3). Our technology, offering substantial improvements over
conventional proteomic approaches, targets the unmet technical need to profile, with deep coverage and high
sensitivity, the protein composition of the tumor ECM. When deployed it will significantly lower the technical
barrier for other researchers to study the ECM, which will have a transformative impact on cancer research."

Trisomy 21 (T21) causes a different disease spectrum in people with Down syndrome (DS), protecting these
individuals from some diseases, while strongly predisposing them to others. For example, >50% of adults with
T21 are affected by one or more autoimmune conditions, including a wide range of immune skin conditions.
Unfortunately, the mechanisms driving this different disease spectrum are poorly understood, which creates a
challenge in the clinical management of DS. We recently discovered that T21 causes consistent activation of the
interferon (IFN) response across diverse cell types, which is likely due to the fact that four of the six IFN receptors
are encoded on chr21. Accordingly, T21 cells are hypersensitive to IFN stimulation, display hyperactivation of
JAK/STAT signaling, and overexpress IFN-Stimulated Genes. Furthermore, dozens of inflammatory cytokines
are dysregulated in people with DS, and T21 drives production of potent neurotoxic metabolites via the IFN-
inducible kynurenine pathway. Therefore, we hypothesize that hyperactivation of IFN signaling drives
immune dysregulation and various pathologies in DS, and that pharmacological inhibition of IFN
signaling could have multidimensional therapeutic benefits in this population. Accordingly, we propose
here to complete a first-in-kind clinical trial for a JAK inhibitor in DS. our Specific Aims are:
1. To define the safety profile of JAK inhibition in people with Down syndrome. We will perform an open-
label Phase II clinical trial for Tofacitinib, a JAK1/3 inhibitor, in people with DS and an active immune skin
condition, with the main primary endpoint being the assessment of safety.
2. To determine the impact of JAK inhibition on the immune dysregulation caused by trisomy 21. Using
blood samples collected during the trial, we will define the impact of JAK inhibition on a) IFN scores derived from
the transcriptome of white blood cells, b) circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines elevated in people with DS,
c) levels of neurotoxic metabolites in the IFN-inducible kynurenine pathway, and d) levels of key autoantibodies
involved in autoimmune thyroid disease and celiac disease, two common co-occurring conditions in DS.
3. To define the impact of JAK inhibition on immune skin conditions in Down syndrome. Using proven
metrics currently employed in clinical trials of JAK inhibitors for immune skin conditions, our main secondary
endpoint will be to determine whether JAK inhibition reduces skin pathology in DS.
4. To characterize the impact of JAK inhibition on cognition and quality of life in Down syndrome. Using
a battery of tests to evaluate cognition in DS, we will explore the impact of JAK inhibition on diverse cognitive
functions. Decreased skin pathology may also affect overall perceived health and enjoyment, as well as have
social implications, which will be measured by quality of life assessments."

 The homeostatic gut microbiota provides essential functions to multiple aspects of human health,
including modulating the interactions between host and enteric pathogens. Perturbations, such as intestinal
inflammation, can shift the beneficial microbiota to an imbalanced state frequently referred to as dysbiosis, which
instead exacerbates inflammatory disease outcomes in susceptible individuals. As such, microbial resilience is
crucial to maintaining the structural and functional stability of the gut microbiome in the face of perturbations.
Despite the central role in host health, mechanisms underlying microbiota resilience remain largely unexplored.
 During intestinal inflammation, the host immune system impedes invading pathogens through the
sequestration of iron, among other micronutrients, in a process termed nutritional immunity. While decades of
research have described how pathogens utilize small iron-chelating molecules termed siderophores to survive
and thrive in the iron-starved inflamed gut, commensal survival strategies during nutritional immunity remain
largely unknown. Our preliminary studies suggested that the prominent gut commensal Bacteroides
thetaiotaomicron (B. theta) can capture iron from siderophores produced by enteric pathogens. Additionally, B.
theta can prioritize its iron expenditure through the activation of a small RNA-mediated iron-sparing response,
thereby conserving the limited iron for essential cellular processes. I hypothesize that B. theta couples
xenosiderophore piracy and iron-sparing response through the action of small RNA to maintain
resilience in the iron-limited inflamed gut. I will test this hypothesis using genetic, biochemical, and
computational approaches in tandem with in vitro growth assays and murine models of infectious colitis.
Experiments proposed in Aim 1 will determine the contribution of xenosiderophore piracy to B. theta fitness,
using in vitro growth kinetics and mouse models of intestinal inflammation. Experiments in Aim 2 will define the
mechanism, regulatory targets, and fitness contribution of iron-responsive B. theta sRNA during iron-limitation
in vitro and in vivo. This proposed work is innovative because it presents a heretofore unexplored microbial
factor in microbiome structure during intestinal inflammation. This proposed work is impactful because
establishing a model for iron regulation in B. theta will provide insights into how interphylum iron metabolism and
intracellular iron homeostasis may broadly contribute to gut microbiota resilience in the inflamed gut."
10900142,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity and chronic pain frequently occur together, which is exacerbated by current pain medications that induce
further weight gain. Our limited understanding of the common neurobiological factor(s) underlying obesity and
pain is a major knowledge gap preventing design of effective treatment strategies. The neuropeptide Neurotensin
(Nts) acts centrally to promote analgesia and weight loss, hence, augmenting Nts signaling could combat
comorbid obesity and chronic pain. Yet, the endogenous source of Nts and the signaling mechanisms mediating
these effects remained elusive. Over the last funding periods we began to address this knowledge gap by
characterizing an endogenous source of Nts that mediates weight loss: Nts-expressing neurons in the lateral
hypothalamic area (LHANts neurons). We’ve published that activating LHANts neurons in normal weight mice
reduces feeding and body weight via an Nts-dependent mechanism. Our new data show that activating LHANts
neurons also alleviates pain. The next challenge is understanding how LHANts neurons elicit these effects to
leverage them for treating obesity-pain. This is important because activating all LHANts neurons in normal weight
mice reduces weight but fails to do in obese mice. Our studies will explain why the anorectic effect is lost in the
obese state and how we can reinstate it. Our pilot data suggest that obesity disrupts Nts expression, which may
impair its suppression of feeding/pain. However, our data support that this may be overcome in obese mice by
activating LHANts input to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or the NtsR-expressing neurons there, which can
restore anorectic and analgesic effects. We therefore hypothesize that obesity reduces endogenous Nts
signaling via the LHANtsVTA pathway, but augmenting this pathway can reduce feeding, weight, and
pain in obese mice via Nts-NtsR signaling. Aim 1 defines how expression of Nts, its receptors, and Nts release
to the VTA is altered in obesity. Aim 2 combines dual recombinase mice and optogenetics to establish how
augmenting the LHANts neuronal input to the VTA restrains feeding and to identify which Nts Receptor isoform
mediates these effects. Aim 3 uses the same approach to reveal how LHANts neuronal input to the VTA alleviates
pain in obese mice. Our basic neuroscience studies will provide rationale for leveraging the central Nts system
to support weight loss and pain relief, and mechanistic evidence for identifying the best cell/receptor target.
Ultimately, this knowledge has potential to recognize Nts as a common actionable target for both obesity and
pain and could guide development of Nts-based strategies to safely treat and alleviate the suffering of the millions
of Americans with obesity-induced pain."

The goal of the proposed fellowship is to prepare the applicant, Lauren Yan, for a career in global mental
health research to inform programmatic and policy interventions in vulnerable communities, with a particular
focus on forcibly displaced populations living in low-resource settings. To this end, the applicant proposes to
investigate social determinants of mental health, trauma exposure, and mental distress among adult displaced
Syrians in Jordan. The applicant will carry out the proposed research while engaging in individualized
mentorship, didactic training, and professional development opportunities targeted towards the following
training objectives: 1) advancing skills in latent variable modeling methods; 2) developing expertise in complex
causal inference methods; 3) gaining experience in new regions and contexts of humanitarian concern; and 4)
engaging in professional development opportunities. These objectives will address gaps in Ms. Yan’s training
and will help propel her toward a productive independent research career.
The proposed research is highly relevant for public mental health. Social determinants of mental health—the
living conditions and non-medical factors that impact mental health and illness—are critical to the well-being of
over 100 million displaced people worldwide. This population faces exceptional challenges related to
conditions of daily life, which compound the mental health problems associated with high trauma exposure.
While social determinants are promising preventive targets for reducing the global burden of mental disorders,
existing studies find heterogenous effects with unclear implications for intervention. There is also a paucity of
longitudinal evidence from low-resource settings—where most forcibly displaced people reside. Consequently,
social determinants’ mechanisms of effect are poorly understood in such contexts. Given these gaps in
knowledge, research from displacement settings in low- and middle-income countries is needed to inform
intervention approaches that more comprehensively support the mental health of displaced populations.
To address these gaps, the proposed research will use data from the Syrian Refugee Life Study to: 1) identify
the latent factor structure of displaced Syrians’ social determinants of mental health; 2) estimate the main
causal effects of social determinants and trauma exposure on mental distress; and 3) evaluate whether social
determinants moderate the relationship between trauma exposure and mental distress. The proposed research
aligns with Goals 2 and 3 of NIMH’s Strategic Plan by providing contextually relevant evidence to understand
mental illness trajectories and enhance prevention strategies."

understanding how anesthetic and analgesic agents block memory formation, prevent conditioned fear
responses, and relieve pain during otherwise unbearable experiences. Current provision of clinical anesthesia
is not universally effective in achieving these goals because of a critical knowledge gap in understanding the
systems-level neuroscience of how these drugs act and interact. The PI is a physician-anesthesiologist and
bioengineer who has established a unique and innovative interdisciplinary framework to address this important
problem. A team of senior collaborators, with expertise in psychology, functional MRI analysis, MRI engineering,
and anesthetic pharmacology has been assembled to take advantage of an extremely productive academic
environment. The project will determine how anesthetics from the seven major mechanistic classes of clinically-
used agents act and interact to affect cognitive functions, including where in the brain changes occur. Steady-
state concentrations of anesthetics will be delivered in a high-field MRI environment, while subjects perform
cognitive tasks with precisely timed acute pain stimulation; electroencephalography, electrodermal, and cardiac
rhythm data will simultaneously be acquired. The inclusion of acute pain, use of high-field functional MRI,
multimodal data and broad characterization of behavior all represent increased rigor compared to prior human
anesthetic neuroscience work, and builds on the PI’s recent studying midazolam and ketamine. The first planned
project will complete the mechanistic clinical trial comparing propofol, dexmedetomidine, and fentanyl, which has
begun under the PI’s K23. This is a randomized placebo-controlled single-blind parallel arm neuroimaging study
in healthy adult volunteers (NCT04062123). The second set of projects will examine lidocaine and sevoflurane,
to complete the individual investigation of representative examples from each major mechanistic class of
commonly-used anesthetics. The third set of proposed projects will address an important barrier to progress by
employing combinations of anesthetics across two or more of the previously characterized mechanistic classes.
This will mark a shift in the paradigm to more realistically model the polypharmacy that is ubiquitous in clinical
anesthesia practice. Combinations of anesthetics will be constrained to those that would be feasible to implement
together in clinical practice and selection will be based on a broad quantitative analysis of data obtained for each
agent studied individually, with the goal of leveraging key synergistic behavioral and neural interactions across
mechanistically-different anesthetics. The overall goal of this substantive program of systems-level neuroscience
research is to identify the key neural signatures that are both necessary and sufficient for anesthetic-induced
inhibition of memory formation, fear conditioning, and pain processing. This will lay the foundation needed to
progress towards the long-term vision of improving clinical practice, through more informed dosing combinations
or enhanced intraoperative measures, to ensure amnesia and analgesia for all patients under anesthesia."

 The ongoing COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlights the need for simple, rapid, and cost-effective
testing for respiratory infections at the point-of-care, including physician’s offices, urgent-care settings,
ambulatory procedural centers, and low-resource environments. The need is particularly notable for respiratory
infections, such as COVID-19 and influenza, which can present with similar symptoms yet require distinct
management strategies. With its high sensitivity and specificity, RT-PCR is the gold standard for the molecular
diagnosis and differentiation among respiratory pathogens. Traditional RT-PCR workflow requires significant
control over specimen contents and reaction conditions, with current methods requiring nucleic acid extraction
prior to amplification and detection. The net result is increased complexity, cost, and/or turnaround time for
diagnosis. In this context, we have observed in recent influenza studies that outstanding analytic performance
characteristics can be achieved without RNA extraction, by applying our novel workflow and Adaptive PCR
technology. Unlike traditional RT-PCR, Adaptive RT-PCR incorporates mirror-image L-DNA enantiomers—
identical in sequence to PCR primers and targets—that modify cycling conditions to match the biochemical
sample contents, thus eliminating the need to monitor reaction temperature. The direct monitoring of reaction
conditions overcomes many of the limitations of traditional PCR, facilitating direct amplification within the original
specimen matrix, simplifying instrument design, and enabling single-tube analyses.
 SARS-CoV-2 and influenza are both enveloped RNA viruses, with specimens collected in the same
manner (i.e. nasopharyngeal swab) and using the same viral transport medium. Therefore, we hypothesize that
we may eliminate RNA extraction for this virus, like we have done for influenza, by performing Adaptive RT-PCR
directly on clinical specimens. We propose to enable a simplified methodology through Adaptive RT-PCR,
creating diagnostics for COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens without RNA extraction. As a collaboration
between biomedical engineers and a COVID-19 diagnostic laboratory, we seek to develop a workflow and
instrument that are simple-to-use, cost-effective, and suitable for point-of-care settings, tools that can rapidly
inform treatment and management strategies. To achieve this goal, Aim 1 will evaluate the performance of RT-
PCR directly – that is, without RNA extraction – using both traditional and Adaptive RT-PCR instrumentation.
Aim 2 will develop multiplexed amplification reagents to create a sensitive and specific respiratory panel that
detects SARS-CoV-2, four other viruses, two bacteria, and one control target. Ultimately, Aim 3 will design and
fabricate a self-contained Adaptive RT-PCR instrument suitable for point-of-care settings, while validating this
system using characterized human specimens in a CLIA-accredited lab environment. Completion of this project
will result in a novel point-of-care tool for both the established and emerging respiratory infections that threaten
public health, facilitating rapid treatment, follow-up, infection prevention, and epidemiologic containment."

Stroke is a significant cause of adult disability in the US. Early treatment with thrombolytics or mechanical
thrombectomy can significantly improve neurological outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
However, following these acute interventions long term recovery care is primarily limited to treatments
designed to prevent stroke recurrence, and to rehabilitation therapies. Factors that can influence long term
prognosis, include age, stroke severity, infarct location, and comorbidities. Many stroke survivors do not
recover full function for normal activities with ~45% of working age adults unable to return to work by 6 to 12
months following stroke. Thus, a major challenge for stroke treatment is the identification of therapeutic
strategies that can help restore function and limit long term disability. In studies conducted in previous cycles of
this grant we have focused on understanding the pathways affecting acute stroke injury. We demonstrated that
during ischemic stroke, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) acts on the parenchymal side of the neurovascular
unit (NVU) to increase blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage
(sICH). Studies established that tPA cleavage releases an inhibitory domain activating platelet derived growth
factor-C (PDGFC) signaling through the PDGF-receptor-α (PDGFRα) in perivascular astrocytes ultimately
leading to downstream signaling by vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and PKCβ in vascular
endothelial cells (ECs) regulating the tight junction complex through occludin phosphorylation. Our long-term
goal is to understand the molecular pathways activated during ischemic stroke and to identify interventions
that make stroke treatment safer and more effective. In this application we will build on these data and
examine the role of the tPA/PDGFRα/VEGF/PKCβ pathway in post-stroke neuroinflammation, and on the
downstream recovery pathways. Our central hypothesis is that in ischemic stroke tPA-mediated early events
in the NVU control both neuroinflammation and post-stroke recovery of brain function. We will test this
hypothesis in three specific aims that will identify the molecular mechanisms of this pathway during early post-
stroke neuroinflammation and on the resolution of neuroinflammation during the transition to healing and the
restoration of cerebral blood flow to the damaged brain tissue. Together, these studies will elucidate
mechanisms by with tPA controls both inflammation and collateral vessel growth and identify potential
interventions to promote long term functional recovery."

Eukaryotic genomes are packaged in chromatin, linear arrays of nucleosomes in association with nonhistone
proteins performing structural, enzymatic, and regulatory functions. This proposal aims to elucidate the interplay
between chromatin organization, remodeling and modification and two key nuclear functions: gene transcription
and DNA repair, using single molecule imaging in living cells to obtain comprehensive datasets on the real-time
dynamics of transcription and DNA repair proteins and chromatin motions, and their integration with theory and
modeling with predictive power.
 We will apply single molecule tracking (SMT) to image at high spatiotemporal resolution the organization,
dynamics, regulation and function of a prototypical pioneer transcription factor, GAGA factor (GAF) in Drosophila.
We will image the global and local nuclear organization and dynamics of wild-type and mutant GAF binding to
cognate DNA elements genome-wide, and at Hsp70 promoters in live hemocytes. We will image the global and
local dynamics of eight prominent chromatin and transcription protein effectors linked to GAF functions. SMT
datasets from the factors imaged above are used to construct theoretical models for GAF interactions with
chromatin targets and test models by experimental manipulation. Studies will be extended to human NF-Y, a
distinct pioneer factor that makes accessible chromatin at the Hsp70 promoter in human cells.
 We will examine the interplay between chromatin organization and dynamics and DNA repair, using very
fast (vf) CRISPR that can generate a double strand break (DSB) anywhere in the genome with high
spatiotemporal resolution. We will determine DSB repair kinetics and chromatin reorganization through time-
resolved chromatin analysis and real-time imaging of repair factors after generating DSB. We will determine the
impact of topologically associated domains and loop extrusion on chromatin modifications and relaxations that
accompany DNA repair, and integrate chromatin and DNA repair kinetics datasets to construct theoretical
models for 4D chromatin reorganization during DSB repair. We will employ a series of chromatin remodeler and
DNA damage response mutants to document causal relationships, and expand the reach of vfCRISPR to other
DNA repair processes including base excision repair and mismatch repair.
 We will merge the above approaches to explore how DNA repair-mediated chromatin alterations affect
transcription in human cells, and reciprocally, how transcription and associated chromatin changes influence
DNA repair dynamics. We will image dynamics of pioneer and non-pioneer factors and key DNA repair enzymes
at the active Hsp70 gene in living human cells, varying the timing of DSB and heat shock to evaluate the influence
of DSB on different stages of transcription. Simultaneous imaging of labeled locus and nascent Hsp70 mRNA
will reveal how transcription affects dynamics of the damaged locus."
10903831,"Project Summary/Abstract
The long-term objective of this proposal is to understand why bariatric surgery is such an effective treatment for
obesity and its associated metabolic complications. Peripheral metabolic signals communicate levels of energy
stores to the brain and elicit a host of neuronal responses that maintain energy balance; such regulatory
mechanisms make it difficult to maintain diet-induced weight loss. The goal is to understand how these central
regulatory mechanisms are circumvented following surgical alterations in the gut. Human studies have been
limited by the lack of rigorous diet-induced weight loss controls and lack of biochemical measurements reflecting
central brain pathways. This proposal will focus on key brain pathways hypothesized to mediate the effects of
surgery on energy balance as well on identifying new pathways in subjects after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
(RYGB) and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (SG) compared to carefully matched dietinduced weight loss controls.
The innovation is in the use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neuropeptide, hormone and protein measurements as
a surrogate for changes in brain activity. In addition to studying neuropeptides (melanocortin, opioid), hormones
(leptin and gut hormones) and neurotransmitters (dopamine and serotonin) that have been implicated in this
process, proteomic analysis will be used to uncover new biomarkers that are unique to surgical weight loss. Our
preliminary proteomic data have identified a pattern of changes in CSF that occurs after diet-induced weight loss
and forms the basis for determining how this pattern is altered after surgery. An important focus will be on the
melanocortin system consisting of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC)derived MSH peptides and the MSH
antagonist, agouti related protein (AgRP), that plays a critical role in regulating energy balance and in responding
to weight loss and is impacted by leptin and gut hormones. CSF levels of the POMC prohormone can serve as
a marker of central POMC activity and we have shown striking correlations of CSF POMC with BMI and leptin.
CSF POMC and AgRP levels decrease and increase respectively following diet-induced weight loss; plasma
AgRP also increases. Given the effects of RYGB and SG on gut hormone levels, we will measure ghrelin, GLP-
1, PYY and FGF19, as they can all affect melanocortin activity and metabolism. CSF leptin and soluble leptin
receptor will also be measured to assess effects on leptin transport into brain. Another focus will be on the HPA
axis which has bidirectional interactions with the brain melanocortin system. Our data show that CSF cortisol
increases after weight loss. Our hypothesis is that distinct biochemical changes will occur in CSF after diet-
induced weight loss and this pattern will be altered after RYBG and SG; CSF proteomic analysis will validate
changes expected to occur in known pathways as well as identify new pathways responsible for the dramatic
effects of bariatric surgery. Understanding the mechanisms through which surgery produces long-term weight
loss is highly significant and paramount to developing new drug targets and filling the therapeutic void in the
treatment of obesity."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia affecting a large percentage of
the elderly population. A hallmark event in AD is the brain accumulation of misfolded protein
aggregates in the form of amyloid and tau pathology. Amyloid pathology comprises the
predominantly extracellular accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in diverse type of amyloid
deposits. Tau pathology appears as hyperphosphorylated Tau aggregates in the form of
neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in neuronal somata and neuropil threads in neuronal dendrites.
Considerable evidence indicates that the accumulation of Aβ aggregates is the initiator of AD
pathogenesis, but that Tau pathology is the main executor of neurodegeneration. Despite the
substantial advances in understanding the genetic, cellular and molecular pathways implicated in
AD, the disease is still incurable and have few (mostly symptomatic) options for treatment.
In this project we propose the discovery and development of drugs for AD treatment by focusing
on inhibiting the spreading of Tau aggregates. We plan to develop a highly relevant and robust
screening assay to identify Tau inhibitors based on the protein misfolding cyclic amplification
(PMCA) technology invented in our lab. PMCA reproduces the seeding/nucleation process that
features the formation of all misfolded protein aggregates in the brain. We have recently
developed a PMCA-based assay to study the seeded polymerization of Tau aggregates. Our goal
is to adapt Tau-PMCA as a high-throughput primary screening test to identify drug candidates
able to inhibit misfolding and aggregation of Tau. In the R61 phase we propose to develop a high-
throughput version of Tau-PMCA (HT-Tau-PMCA) assay and validate it in terms of robustness,
reproducibility and specificity using standard practices in the pharmaceutical industry. We will also
perform a pilot screening of 2000 compounds to evaluate assay quality and estimate the rate of
hit identification. In the R33 phase we propose to perform a large screening of a chemical library
containing 100,000 compounds from diverse chemical classes. Hits identified by HT-Tau-PMCA
will be characterized to obtain IC50 and to analyze specificity against other misfolded proteins.
Hits with IC50 < 1 µM will be characterized by their drug-like properties using in silico approaches.
The best hits will be used for studies using cellular and animal models of Tau propagation. This
project has the potential to identify new chemical compounds with ability to inhibit Tau seeding
and spreading that can be developed as a much needed therapy for AD."
10904698,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The goal to end the HIV epidemic (EHE) in the United States cannot be achieved if people with HIV (PWH)
do not achieve sustained viral suppression (VS). However, more than half of PWH in the US do not receive
regular HIV care, due largely to social and structural factors like stigma and discrimination, poverty, and care
complexity, as well as conditions like mental health and substance abuse. Additional approaches to care delivery,
especially for PWH experiencing compounding barriers, are needed to close the gap in sustained care and VS.
 Low-barrier care (LBC) is a package of implementation and care engagement strategies developed
specifically to address barriers experienced by PWH with complex needs and has been shown to significantly
improve VS among this population. The original model of standalone LBC clinics, however, may have challenges
in scalability due to feasibility and limited reach to PWH within large areas. In contrast, adapting LBC strategies
for integration into existing HIV primary care sites has the potential to facilitate greater use of this promising
model of HIV care while also engaging more PWH with unaddressed needs. The overarching goal of this
proposal is to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of adapted LBC strategies in a system of 12 HIV
population-centered health homes (PCHHs) funded by the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) using
a pragmatic trial design. Guided by the EPIS framework, we will achieve this goal through three specific aims:
 (1) Facilitate adoption, adaptation, and implementation of LBC strategies by PCHHs using a learning
collaborative. Learning collaboratives are widely used, evidence-based implementation strategies. Following
best practices, a lead facilitator and subject matter experts will help PCHHs explore and prepare protocols for
implementation of LBC strategies while trained practice coaches will provide technical assistance around
implementation at each site. CDPH has strong interest in integrating LBC strategies into PCHHs and will both
mandate PCHH participation in the learning collaborative and encourage LBC implementation through additional
funding. We will assess the process of adoption and implementation of LBC strategies using mixed methods.
 (2) Evaluate site-specific and system-wide effectiveness of integrated LBC strategies at improving
sustained care and VS. Using a single-arm, pre–post trial design, we will assess if rates of retention in care
and VS improve in the two years following ramp-up of LBC strategies. We will also examine contextual factors
and implementation fidelity using mixed methods to explain variability in outcomes across PCHHs.
 (3) Assess implementation cost and sustainment of LBC strategies among PCHHs. We will examine
implementation costs over time and plans for sustainment using mixed methods.
 Our proposal directly responds to RFA-AI-21-024 and is consistent with the NIH Office of AIDS Research’s
high priority of implementation science to improve HIV service delivery and reduce disparities in treatment.
Results from this study will facilitate the use of LBC strategies in new settings to reach PWH with complex needs."
10904700,"Structurally dissecting APOBEC3s for HIV-1 restriction and beyond
The human immune system protects us against pathogens but can cause problems when
the system goes awry. Implicated in both innate and adaptive immunity, the AID/APOBEC
family of enzymes are cytidine deaminases with differential roles of still limited
understanding. A subset of APOBEC3s (A3s) were initially discovered to potently restrict
HIV-1, including A3G, A3F and A3H. These restrictive enzymes are so potent that HIV
evolved the “virion infectivity factor” protein Vif to counter this restriction by hijacking an E3
ubiquitin ligase and specifically targeting A3s for degradation. Subsequent research has
revealed that A3’s ability to respond and restrict viral infection is by inducing
hypermutations in the viral genome, which is not limited to HIV but extends to other
retroviruses and retrotransposons. A3s also restrict DNA viruses, including nuclear
replicating ssDNA viruses such as adeno-associated virus and dsDNA viruses such as
hepatitis B virus, herpes viruses and HPV. However, A3 activity can be a double-edged
sword. If not properly regulated, DNA-editing APOBECs that also have access to the
nucleus can deaminate self-genomes, potentially instigating cancer. When overexpressed,
A3A, A3B and A3H have been described as a major endogenous source for mutations in
various types of human cancer, such as breast, bladder, head and neck, cervical, and lung
cancer. We hypothesize that A3s have unrealized therapeutic potentials, both as anti-viral
targets through reactivating the natural anti-HIV function by blocking Vif binding and as
targets for chemotherapy to restrict the genome diversity within tumors. In this proposal we
are leveraging our complementary strengths through a multi-disciplinary approach combining
structural biology, biophysics, enzymology, chemistry and virology, to characterize the
molecular interactions and differential specificities of A3s to nucleic acids and HIV-1 Vif, which
will provide epitopes that once characterized will be target sites for future therapeutic
development."
10904703,"Learning from Hospital Preparedness during COVID:
Chronically Under-Resourced Nurses and Patient Safety
This study will evaluate how hospital nurses weathered the COVID-19 public health emergency, whether and
to what extent hospital nurse resources (staffing, work environment, Magnet designation) buffered nurses from
poor outcomes (such as burnout) during the pandemic and facilitated recovery 3 years after the onset of the
COVID emergency, and the extent to which patient outcomes, safety, quality, and value of care indicators
paralleled changes in nurse outcomes and hospital nurse resources over the study period. We will accomplish
these objectives by leveraging already existing data from over 33,000 hospital nurses in 244 hospitals in New
York and Illinois, [Wave 1 data collected just before COVID (Dec 2019-Feb 2020); Wave 2 collected 1 year
after COVID onset] and by conducting primary data collection of repeat measures [Wave 3 to be collected 3
years after COVID onset (Oct 2022-Dec 2022)]. Each Wave includes repeated measures of nurse outcomes
(e.g., burnout, job dissatisfaction, intent to leave job), hospital nurse resources (staffing, work environment,
Magnet), measures of patient safety and quality of care, including items from the AHRQ Patient Safety Culture
survey. These cross-sections of data will be linked with contemporaneous (1) patient-level data from CMS
MedPAR Medicare to study risk-adjusted patient outcomes among patients hospitalized for common medical,
surgical, and COVID diagnoses; (2) Hospital Compare data to evaluate hospital-level measures of patient
satisfaction and healthcare value (Medicare spending per beneficiary), (3) American Hospital Association data
for considering organizational features of hospitals, and (4) publicly available COVID hospitalization data to
account for variation in COVID burden across hospitals. In combination, we will have 3 cross-sections of data
from 244 hospitals (with fluctuating nurse and patient populations) just before, 1 year and 3 years after the
onset of the COVID emergency. Our analytic approach uses multi-level nested (hierarchically-related) linear
and logistic regression models (with interaction terms). The COVID emergency offers a unique opportunity to
make a major advance in our scientific understanding of the potentially causal relationships between nurse
outcomes and patient outcomes, which have until now largely only been rigorously evaluated in the cross-
section. The tremendous shock imposed by the COVID emergency, combined with our propitiously timed data,
enable us to evaluate how the pandemic impacted hospital nurses and what hospital factors contribute to a
more favorable recovery in the years following the COVID emergency. Together, this evidence will inform high-
impact actionable policy and organizational solutions for building and sustaining safe, high value healthcare
systems that can endure future public health emergencies and thrive during ordinary times."
10904892,"Project Abstract.
Insomnia disorder impacts one in two women by the end of their 3rd trimester, and half of pregnant women with
insomnia endorse comorbid depression. Though cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) has efficacy
in pregnancy, CBTI produces smaller effects on insomnia and depression as compared to non-perinatal patients.
Our team has identified a promising candidate factor that predicts suboptimal response to insomnia
therapy: high cognitive arousal, a transdiagnostic phenomenon of heightened cognitive activity, particularly in
the form of perseverative thinking (worry, rumination). Nearly all pregnant women with insomnia have high
cognitive arousal before insomnia therapy, but CBTI produces minimal effect on these symptoms. Pregnant
women with high cognitive arousal after insomnia therapy are 4 times LESS likely to remit from insomnia, and 3
times MORE likely to have depression relative to women whose arousal decreases with therapy. In effort to
enhance alleviation of cognitive arousal to optimize clinical outcomes, we placed efficacious behavioral sleep
strategies within a mindfulness intervention framework to develop an insomnia therapy specifically for pregnant
women: Perinatal Understanding of Mindful Awareness for Sleep (PUMAS). Unlike CBTI, efficacy data show that
PUMAS produces large reductions in insomnia, depression, and cognitive arousal relative to control. Moreover,
efficacy data suggest that reducing cognitive arousal may represent a mechanism by which PUMAS reduces
insomnia and depression. The next step in the NIMH phase of intervention development is to translate these
efficacy data into real-world practice. Evaluating the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of
PUMAS implemented in real-world clinics is absolutely critical and has immense potential to reduce burden of
maternal mental illness. Aligned with NIMH emphasis on experimental therapeutics approach, we will investigate
reductions in cognitive arousal as a key mechanism by which PUMAS alleviates insomnia and depression. We
propose an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 1 pilot RCT wherein 100 pregnant women with DSM-5
insomnia disorder are randomized to telemedicine PUMAS or sham therapy control. We will implement PUMAS
in all 23 women’s health clinics across Henry Ford Health System, centrally located in Metro Detroit.
Implementation will reflect real-world clinic operations such that women receiving prenatal care who report sleep
difficulties will be referred by OB physicians and midwifes to therapists embedded in the women’s health clinics
for evaluation and treatment. After treatment, we will assess participants across the first postpartum year to
preliminarily evaluate the durability of clinical outcomes. This project will not only test PUMAS preliminary
effectiveness for insomnia and depression, but will also investigate whether PUMAS engages a key candidate
mechanism (high cognitive arousal) that is operative for alleviating these clinical outcomes in the effectiveness
context (PAR-21-131)."

I am an Assistant Research Scientist in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at the New York
University School of Global Public Health (NYU GPH). My career goal is to engage in research and practice that
improves the mental health of marginalized populations globally. My academic training included applied
mathematics (BS, ’05), health policy and management (MPH, ’08), community health sciences (PhD, ’14), and
global mental health (postdoctoral fellowships, ’17 and ’20). I have also received training in mixed-methods and
community-based participatory research. Although I have strong analytical skills in evaluating mental health
interventions, I would now like to develop skills to support the implementation of mental health interventions that
are integrated with the treatment of other health conditions—particularly: cancer. This pivot will require an
additional set of knowledge and skills. Accordingly, my goal in this K01 award is to obtain tailored training and
mentorship in four key areas critical in becoming an independent international research scientist with a focus on
global cancer control and prevention. I have assembled an experienced, international, multidisciplinary team of
mentors who are committed to my career development. The mentoring committee will be co-led by two
distinguished scholars in implementation science and health services research: Dr. Donna Shelley (NYU GPH)
and Dr. Minh Van Hoang (Hanoi University of Public Health [HUPH]). My co-mentors include two experts in
global mental health research and practice—Dr. Lawrence H. Yang (NYU GPH) and Dr. Wietse A. Tol (University
of Copenhagen)—and two experts in cancer control and prevention—Dr. Ophira Ginsburg (NYU Perlmutter
Cancer Center) and Dr. Huong Tran (Hanoi Medical University, Viet Nam National Cancer Institute). The career
development activities are designed to leverage the wide range of mentors and activities at NYU and to facilitate
the knowledge exchange between NYU and HUPH throughout my alternating residences between the U.S. and
Viet Nam. My research plan is to adapt and pilot an enhanced stress management intervention for breast cancer
patients in Viet Nam. First, I will conduct qualitative research to assess the acceptability and appropriateness of
implementing the Self-Help Plus (SH+) program, with an additional peer support component, to help breast
cancer patients manage their distress. The findings from this step will help identify the potential modifications
needed. Second, I will convene a working group to select and implement the adaptations, including the additional
Peer support component (P). Finally, I will pilot the adapted, peer-facilitated SH+P intervention to evaluate its
feasibility. Upon successful completion of the training and research activities, I will be prepared to develop an
R01 proposal to test the implementation and effectiveness of the adapted intervention in reducing psychological
distress among breast cancer patients in Viet Nam. Findings can ultimately inform the development of evidence-
based, culturally-adapted psychosocial interventions for cancer patients in many low- and middle-income
countries as well as for different racial/ethnic groups in the U.S."
10899048,"Each year in the US, severe TBI in children results in ∼7400 deaths and 60 000 hospitalizations. Fifty percent
of surviving children with severe TBI have poor neurological outcome at six months. Severe TBI in children is
thus a critical problem in desperate need of impactful therapies. Free radicals and oxidative stress have been
uniformly accepted as universal pathogenic mechanisms of TBI prompting therapeutic use of antioxidants.
Invariably, clinical trials of non-specific free radical scavengers/antioxidants failed. This suggests that true
sources and mechanisms of TBI redox disbalance remain undefined, and represent a potential therapeutic
opportunity. During the previous funding period we showed that lipid peroxidation after TBI in immature brain
occurs as a result of controlled enzymatic reactions. We discovered that peroxidation of mitochondrial
phospholipid cardiolipin (CL) represents a required stage of neuronal apoptosis after TBI in postnatal day
(PND) 17 rats. We identified cytochrome c as a catalyst of CL peroxidation and showed that a mitochondria-
targeted inhibitor of CL peroxidation suppressed TBI-induced apoptosis and preserved cognitive function in
PND17 rats. Our latest work identified highly selective oxidation of arachidonic acid (AA) containing
phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) by 15 lipoxygenase (15LOX) to be causative to ferroptosis. We discovered
that PE binding protein 1 (PEBP1) complexes with 15LOX and changes its substrate specificity from free AA to
AA esterified into PE to generate hydroperoxy-AA-PE death signals. Normally hydroperoxy-AA-PE are
eliminated by combined action of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)/glutathione (GSH). Immature brain has
lower GSH levels and GPX activity vs adult brain thus could be more vulnerable to ferroptosis upon injury.
Indeed our preliminary data show that TBI leads to marked increase in expression and activity of 15LOX, and
accumulation of oxidized AA-PE in PND17 rat brain. Furthermore, preliminary data indicate that inhibition of
AA-PE oxidation suppresses TBI-induced neuronal death and preserves cognitive function. Thus, we
hypothesize that generation of oxidized AA-PE by 15LOX/PEBP1 complex leads to neuronal death and
represents a new target for drug discovery leading to innovative therapies in pediatric TBI. We propose to test
our hypothesis in three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine the degree, spatial and temporal pattern of
15LOX/PEBP1 complex formation and AA-PE oxidation after TBI. Aim 2 will investigate the mechanisms of
AA-PE oxidation in TBI-induced neuronal death. Aim 3 will design and investigate the mechanism of action and
neuroprotective potential of small-molecule regulators of 15LOX and 15LOX/PEBP1 activity in TBI. These
studies will employ powerful lipidomics and oxidative lipidomics technology to provide important mechanistic
information on the role of PE oxidation in neuronal ferroptosis after pediatric TBI. The ability to selectively
modulate PE oxidation, a critical early event in the mechanism of ferroptosis, could lead to targeted therapies
for TBI and ultimately improve outcome for children after brain injury."

10898376,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest forms of cancer in the United States. The low mutational
burden in PDAC leads to low infiltration of T cells that could become cytotoxic to cancer cells by administration of immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Neoantigen vaccines promote T cell invasion, but do not protect T cells from exhaustion.
Analysis of immunotherapy approaches to clinical treatment of PDAC combining cancer vaccines with ICIs suggests that
efficacious immune response involves alterations in cell-cell communication among tumor-invading immune cells. Murine
models of neoantigen response indicate that simultaneous priming of tumor-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells increases
survival through CD4+ T cell-dependent enhancement of anti-tumor CD8+ T cell and myeloid cell functions. I hypothesize
that effective immunotherapy response in PDAC is dependent on altering cellular signaling networks in the tumor
microenvironment to maintain durable cytotoxic effector states and hinder immunosuppressive signals. To test this
hypothesis, I will utilize single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from a compiled atlas of immunotherapy-naïve
PDAC, primary tumors from a neoadjuvant trial of combination immunotherapy for PDAC, and a murine model of
personalized neoantigen vaccine treatment for PDAC. Experiments posed in Aim 1 will develop statistical methods for the
utilization of the cellular communication inference tool Domino in identifying cellular interactions that differentially occur
between treatment groups in scRNA-seq data from clinical trials of combination immunotherapy in humans. Experiments
posed in Aim 2 will identify the mechanism by which the tumor-specific T cells expanded by the neoantigen vaccine
PancVAX2 attack liver metastases in an orthotopic murine model of PDAC through flow cytometry and inference of cell-
cell communication in scRNA-seq data. Collectively, these experiments will inform mechanistic understanding of how
combination immunotherapies enhance immune responses to PDAC through enhancement of T cell cytotoxicity and
alterations of communication between immune cells. This proposed work will have broad applications improving
immunotherapy approaches to the treatment of PDAC and develop computational tools for scRNA-seq analysis to assess
how cellular communication is altered by outside perturbations and sample features."

High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) is a 215-amino acid protein that plays multiple roles in humans.
Intracellularly, HMGB1 is chromatin-associated and involved in virtually all types of DNA metabolism (e.g.
replication, repair, recombination), primarily through its ability to bind with high affinity and specificity to
various DNA structures. Extracellularly, HMGB1 is the prototypical damage-associated molecular pattern
molecule (DAMP) with strong pro-inflammatory functions. Here, we have discovered, and will show, that
endogenous HMGB1 has a heretofore unknown function in its ability to control bacteria that cause chronic
and recurrent infections, which thereby contributes to the delicate balance of host-pathogen interactions. For
bacteria to enter a chronic infection state, they must assume a community architecture called a biofilm,
replete with a self-made extracellular matrix commonly composed of scaffolded extracellular DNA (eDNA)
that is highly resistant to clearance by both the host immune system and antimicrobials. We have previously
shown that this eDNA-dependent structure is stabilized by the DNABII family of bacterial proteins, that when
added exogenously can drive free-living (planktonic) bacteria into a biofilm. Unlike these proteins, we show
that HMGB1 destabilizes the eDNA structure and drives biofilm-resident bacteria into the planktonic,
vulnerable state. The DNABII family and HMGB1 have similar DNA structure binding preferences in vitro
despite a lack of primary amino acid sequence identity and secondary structure. We therefore hypothesize
that despite their similar DNA structure binding preferences, these proteins facilitate converse reactions.
Further, the fact that endogenous native HMGB1 steady state levels restrict, but fail to clear, chronic
infections suggests a balance with HMGB1’s needed pro-inflammatory functions, i.e. release of bacteria
from biofilms under strong inflammatory conditions could lead to sepsis. Herein, we will work under the
scientific premise that eDNA-binding is essential for HMGB1 to disrupt bacterial biofilms and further, that it
will be possible to separate its anti-biofilm activity from pro-inflammatory functions. Indeed, we have
truncated HMGB1 to 97 amino acids, a form which still retains full anti-biofilm activity but without pro-
inflammatory functions, thereby likely able to tip the host-pathogen interaction in favor of the host. Through
the completion of 3 highly integrated specific aims, we will determine the capacity of this HMGB1 derived
97-mer to act as an anti-biofilm agent on biofilms formed by diverse human pathogens in vitro as well as
biofilms within polymicrobial clinical samples, assayed ex-vivo (to determine the breadth of activity and
support our overarching hypothesis; AIM 1), the anti-biofilm mechanism of action, through a process of DNA
binding (AIM 2), and the therapeutic efficacy in two distinct animal models of biofilm infections (AIM 3)."
10899471,"ABSTRACT
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB) in humans, currently leads to nearly
1.7 million deaths a year. TB control is threatened by the continued emergence of drug-resistant Mtb strains.
Clinical resistance has now been observed against all TB drugs, underscoring the urgent need not just for new
drugs, but for entirely new strategies that directly target and disable drug resistance mechanisms. Two of the
most promising strategies to prevent the emergence of antibiotic resistance in the treatment of TB are the
targeting of drug tolerant, non-replicating bacterial populations and host-directed therapy (HDT). We identified a
series of drug-like ATP analogs with in vitro activity against replicating and non-replicating Mtb that is comparable
to that of rifampicin, one of the first-line drugs targeting non-replicating Mtb. Because these inhibitors were
originally developed for the inhibition of the human transforming growth factor receptor (TGFβR), a pathway
implicated in immunity to TB, we also sought to test whether inhibition of TGFβR mediates host-directed activity
against Mtb. We found that genetic deletion and chemical inhibition of TGFβR significantly reduced the bacterial
load in infected animals. We showed that T-cells lacking TGFβR had an increased capacity to interact in a
cognate manner with Mtb-infected macrophages and produce IFNγ at the pulmonary site of infection. These
preliminary studies suggest a new answer to the longstanding question why the T cell response to Mtb is
inadequate at the site of infection and highlights the possibility that TGFβ signaling is a new HDT target. Thus,
we identified compounds that have two independent activities that both kill Mtb and likely impede the emergence
of drug resistance. Using genetics and the ATP analogs as chemical tools, we will identify the cellular Mtb targets
responsible for directly killing Mtb, thus identifying new targets that underlie drug tolerance. On the host side, we
will determine the role of TGFβR signaling in Mtb infection. Lastly, we will test this dual host-pathogen targeting
strategy by testing the efficacy of our compounds in vivo."

CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China in December 2019 and by early 2021, there have
been more than 100 million cases of COVID-19 globally. The consequences of COVID-19 in pregnant women
in high/upper middle-income countries are under intensive investigation. There are few parallel studies in
low/lower middle- income countries (LMIC) and data on COVID-19 infection in high-income countries may not
be generalizable to LMIC. Given the large number of the world’s births that occur in LMIC, there is an urgent
need to understand the risk of COVID-19 (and other respiratory viruses (ORV), particularly influenza) to pregnant
women and newborns. Our group recently led the Indian site of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
study on the impact of laboratory confirmed influenza in pregnant women in 3 LMICs, finding that influenza was
associated with late pregnancy loss and reduced mean birthweight. Leveraging this recently completed study
and 10 years of experience of studying ~10,000 pregnant women a year in Central India, we now propose the
“Influenza & COVID Obstetric and Perinatal Epidemiology (ICOPE) Study in India.” ICOPE will enrol 10,000
pregnant women presenting to a large obstetric hospital in Nagpur, India for antenatal care. Important features
of our study include: (i) documented ability to recruit women in the first trimester of pregnancy (ultrasound
confirmed); (ii) twice weekly follow-up for COVID-19/ORV/Influenza symptoms, combined with laboratory testing
for symptomatic and asymptomatic infection (reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction testing of
nasopharyngeal swabs and frequent collection of dried blood spots for COVID IgG and IgM) during pregnancy
through day 7 post-partum. Neonates with critical illness will be assessed for COVID-19 and influenza and dried
blood spots will be obtained for COVID antibodies on day 7 of life. Pregnant women admitted with COVID-19
will have specimens obtained to evaluate trajectories of inflammatory cytokines. We will biobank dried blood
spots for future studies. Our specific aims are to: (1) determine the prevalence, incidence and maximal severity
of symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 in pregnant women to day 7 postpartum and whether influenza/ORV
infection or vaccination modifies and pre-term birth mediates this risk; (2) determine the effect of maternal
COVID-19 infection on the fetus and/or neonate to day 7 of life; and whether influenza/ORV or vaccination
modifies and pre-term birth mediates this risk; (3) characterize patterns and trajectories of host
response/inflammatory biomarkers as potential mediators of COVID-19±influenza infection on progression to
severe illness in pregnant women/mothers admitted with COVID-19. Modifiers include vaccination. ICOPE is
well positioned to provide information on the impact of COVID-19 and ORV, across all trimesters, over time in a
LMIC setting."
10899565,"PROJECT SUMMARY Children who are overweight during early childhood are at least 5 times more likely
than normal weight children to be overweight/obese as adults. Yet, for 2 to 5-year-olds, the obesity prevalence
is 16.7% for Hispanic children, 12.4% for non-Hispanic Black (NHB) children, 9.3% for non-Hispanic white
(NHW) children, and 9.1% for Asians. Once established, obesity and its comorbid medical conditions, many of
which disproportionally affect Hispanics, are difficult to treat and usually persist throughout adulthood. Thus,
preventing its development as early as possible in life is critical to reduce the health care costs associated with
obesity-related chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Hispanic children have a
higher prevalence of behaviors and determinants that put them at a high risk of obesity including suboptimal
breastfeeding, early introduction of solid foods, and poor infant sleep quality and duration. Current evidence
suggests that successful obesity prevention interventions occur in infancy/early childhood and are family-
based. However, few studies meet that criteria and even fewer studies target at-risk minorities. The goal of this
application is to develop and pilot the feasibility of a social media-based, bilingual, multigenerational
entertainment education (EE) intervention for primiparous Hispanic pregnant women and their mothers to
prevent the onset of obesity in infants. The aims of this study are to conduct formative research for the
development and pilot testing of an early childhood obesity preventive intervention for Hispanic pregnant
women and their mothers to establish healthy infant weight, increase breastfeeding, infant sleep, and delay
solid food introduction. In Aim 1a, qualitative data will be gathered on mother/grandmother dyads attitudes
towards content and user engagement. The results will inform the development of EE video clips and
accompanying activities. In Aim1b, we will examine mother/grandmother dyads’ acceptability of developed EE
video clips, feasibility of activities, and overall approach to dissemination. A sample of 50 Hispanic pregnant
mother-grandmother will be randomly assigned to either the experimental or control condition and followed for
6 months, with assessment at baseline (birth), 3- and 6-months. The control condition will proceed with care as
usual. This iterative process will culminate in a pilot test randomizing 50 Hispanic mother-grandmother in a 12
week intervention versus care as usual. Additionally, changes in mother and grandmother health will be
assessed as secondary outcomes and changes in social support will be examined as a potential mediators of
the effect of condition on outcomes. Covariates include sociodemographic information, health history,
measures on breastfeeding self-efficacy, and acculturation. In addition to feasibility and acceptability
measures, preliminary effect estimates will be calculated to inform a subsequent R01 trial. This proposed study
would help advance science of early childhood obesity prevention interventions by harnessing the power of
social media and EE to promote health behaviors among Hispanic families."
10899712,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Birth defects cause tremendous individual, familial, and societal burdens, and the development of targeted
prevention strategies has been stymied by biological and etiological complexity. Exemplary of multifactorial
birth defects thought to be substantially modulated by the environment are orofacial clefts (OFCs) and
holoprosencephaly (HPE), common human malformations of the face and brain. The pathogenesis of both
OFCs and HPE is directly linked to embryonic disruption of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in animal models,
supporting a pathway-based investigation of environmental contributions to birth defect etiology. That Shh
signaling comprises a multi-step process inherently sensitive to modulation across multiple steps of its
signaling cascade makes the pathway especially germane for examining the impact of co-exposures on
etiologically complex, multifactorial disease. The studies proposed in this application are designed to test the
central hypothesis that structurally diverse Shh inhibitors synergistically interact to reduce pathway activity at
the cellular level and exacerbate Shh-associated craniofacial malformations. To test this hypothesis, I have
leveraged NIEHS- and EPA-supported high-throughput chemical screens to create a prioritized list of
environmentally relevant, putative Shh pathway disruptors and developed a novel Shh pathway-complete cell
culture system that is sensitive to inhibition throughout the Shh pathway. I will utilize this system and other
mechanism-based in vitro assays to validate bona fide pathway antagonists, delineate molecular targets within
the Shh pathway, and evaluate additive and synergistic interactions resulting from co-exposure to compounds
with diverse pathway targets. The developmental toxicity of these compounds will then be examined, both
individually and in combination, by targeting dose administration to critical periods of Shh pathway activity
during craniofacial development. The known Shh antagonists cyclopamine, vismodegib, and piperonyl
butoxide will be used throughout the proposed studies as positive controls for pathway-specific effects. These
rigorously designed experiments are expected to reveal environmental factors that adversely impact
development and elucidate mechanisms of Shh pathway disruption that promote synergistic interactions. In
completing the proposed studies, the applicant’s professional development will be advanced through the
establishment of proficiency in experimental design, evaluating the toxicity of mixtures, utilizing animal
models of developmental toxicology, and effectively communicating scientific concepts and results. These
works will also facilitate the applicant’s goal of becoming an independent investigator at a government agency
within the United States."
10899941,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Community engagement is fundamental to minority health and health disparities (MH/HD) research, helping to
ensure that scientific knowledge moves from inquiry and findings to tangible, sustainable impact. Building robust
community partnerships, novel dissemination strategies, and advancing the science of engagement are critical
activities for both aspiring and experienced MH/HD investigators. Few researchers, however, have the mentors
and networks needed to form strong, egalitarian partnerships, rigorously apply and assess engagement
strategies, and disseminate findings to scientific and non-scientific audiences. Catalyst will create a novel,
sustainable, scalable hub for community engagement research training, education, and multi-directional capacity
building accessible to researchers at all levels and across all disciplines. The Community Engagement and
Dissemination Core (CEDC) will address the engagement needs and interests of basic and translational
investigators with experience in MH/HD research and those new to this work. We will guide researchers who
employ a broad range of methods and study designs to develop or expand community partnerships and engage
multi-sector stakeholders to conduct MH/HD research in their areas of focus. In collaboration with the other
Cores, we aim to: (1) Convene a Catalyst Community Board (CCB) by building on existing academic-
community partnerships to support the development, implementation, and dissemination of MH/HD research.
We will unify two engagement approaches our team has been refining for nearly a decade: an Accelerator Model
in which distinct groups of community members and other stakeholders each focus on a specific community-
prioritized topic or health problem (e.g., environmental or mental health), and a Network Model comprised of
community leaders representing a population (e.g., justice-involved individuals) or a neighborhood (e.g., South
Bronx) experiencing high rates of disparities. (2) Cultivate community-engaged research capacity of Mount
Sinai investigators, community partners, and other relevant stakeholders. To support the Pilot Project Program,
we will contribute to all programmatic, training, and capacity building activities of the IDC, including input into the
pilot project solicitation, review of applications, study design and conduct, and development dissemination
strategies. To support the broader investigator community, CEDC and CCB members will participate in the
Consultation Service; relevant Health Equity Topics Seminars; sponsor an Annual Research Ideation Event to
brainstorm research topics and engagement strategies; and build new community-academic partnerships. (3)
Leverage novel participatory strategies to optimize dissemination of Catalyst-funded projects through our
boards and multi-level stakeholder networks, including 100+ NYC-wide community navigators we trained in
research literacy. CEDC will guide academic-community partners to co-prepare manuscripts and presentations,
host Policy and Payer Summits, and rigorously evaluate all CEDC activities. We will craft and disseminate a
Catalyst Center Blueprint to support adaptation of our strategies by others committed to advancing health equity."

10899632,"CUSTOMIZABLE TRAINING SOFTWARE FOR PROFESSIONAL ALZHEIMER DIRECT CARE PROVIDERS
 Project Summary/Abstract - ProActive Memory Services, Inc.
New strategies are urgently needed to improve Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/RD) training
for 4.6 million professional direct care providers that assist 8.3 million older adults in the US. Assisted living
facilities (ALF) and personal care agencies (PCA) are the largest and fastest growing segments of the long-
term care industry, but where there also are concerns about minimal practice standards, training, and
oversight. Current training options lack customization and flexibility to address the diverse backgrounds of
providers and their individual learning styles. Inadequate training causes undue stress, a lack of empathy, work
dissatisfaction, job turnover and higher training costs. ProActive Memory Services, Inc. will test a revolutionary
new strategy that transforms occasional, episodic AD/RD training to continuously accessible training using
mobile software. We hypothesize that advantages of individually customized training, increased on-job support
and supervision, and efficient documentation will lead to adoption of this new approach. In Phase I we will
evaluate training needs and preferences in semi-structured interviews, focus groups and surveys with 10 direct
care providers and administrators in 4 ALF and PCA organizations to guide the development of prototype
professional training software based on our commercial mobile software for family caregivers,
MemoryCarePartner©. Modifications of our software platform will consistently direct learners to pre-
programmed training pathways, individually tailored to role, level of training, care setting, state and
organization and allow personal tracking of training progress. Learners can explore text and audiovisual
content to fit individual learning styles. The flexible format adapts to diverse learner abilities and irregular work
schedules. In Phase II we will evaluate educational outcomes and sustained engagement when using our
prototype training software through server data, user and administrator online feedback, focus groups and
interviews. Our findings in four successive groups of 10 direct care trainees will be used to develop iterative
code sprints to modify our training software and optimize observed user experience and educational
achievement. Maximizing value also will be achieved through improved documentation of regulatory training
requirements and the likelihood of organization adoption and commercial potential of this new training strategy.
Our ultimate goal is to use our proactive and preventative focus to facilitate evidence-based collaborative and
person-centered care to thus improve the quality of professional direct care for the growing number of
Americans facing AD/RD."
10898181,"Project Summary:
A long-standing problem in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain
tumor, is the efficient delivery of therapeutics to the highly invasive tumor cells that pervasively infiltrate the brain
and are sheltered from many therapeutics behind an intact, functional blood-brain barrier (BBB). This problem is
compounded by the fact that pre-clinical models of GBM often do not recapitulate the highly invasive nature of
clinical disease and do not incorporate the multi-modal standard-of-care (SOC) treatments that the majority of
patients receive. SOC interventions are important to include in our pre-clinical modeling because they
significantly alter the clinically relevant disease state, and new investigational therapies will likely be first tested
in the setting of the SOC. Focused ultrasound in combination with intravenously administered microbubbles (MB-
FUS) is an emerging technology that has been shown to induce transient BBB opening without permanent
damage. In the field of neuro-oncology, MB-FUS has been reported to increase delivery of a variety of agents
and improve survival in preclinical brain tumor studies and is currently undergoing early-stage testing in humans.
A critical next step in the development of this novel treatment paradigm is characterizing the pharmacokinetics
(PK) of therapeutic classes that have historically been excluded from treatment considerations in GBM due to
the BBB, such as therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). This proposed F30 project will study the delivery
and effects of a new immunotherapeutic mAb, anti-CD47 (mCD47). To address the aforementioned gaps and
needs, Dr. Graeme Woodworth (primary sponsor), Dr. Miroslaw Janowski (co-sponsor), Dr, Gavin Dunn (co-
sponsor), and Mr. Malla (PD/PI) propose to leverage PET-CT for evaluating MB-FUS-mediated delivery of mAbs
in a clinically representative animal model of invasive, post-surgical GBM. The central hypothesis of this proposal
is that MB-FUS will augment the delivery and immunomodulatory effects of mCD47 co-localized within targeted
regions of the post-surgical, non-contrast enhancing resection cavity margins. In Aim 1 we will radiolabel and
define the MB-FUS-mediated biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of mCD47 in the peri-resectional non-CE
regions of post-surgical GBM. In Aim 2, we will assess the impact of MB-FUS-mediated mCD47 treatment in the
setting of current standard resective surgery and chemotherapy (TMZ). Successful completion of the proposed
studies will generate critical data for rationally designing clinical trials using this interventional MB-FUS-immuno-
PET workflow, which we are exceptionally well positioned to translate given our i) ongoing clinical trial evaluating
adjuvant MB-FUS prior to each standard monthly dose of TMZ in GBM patients and ii) our established
infrastructure for applying MB-FUS and immunoPET in both animals and patients."
10901464,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The abilities to detect errors and improve performance following mistakes are paramount to behaviors such as
speech and musicianship. Although hearing is instrumental for monitoring and adapting these behaviors, the
neural circuits that integrate motor, acoustic, and goal-related signals to detect errors and guide
sensorimotor learning in mammals remain unidentified. In this proposal, we will employ two aims to
investigate how the mouse auditory cortex encodes error- and learning-related signals during skilled sound-
generating behavior, and whether auditory-cortical activity is necessary for learning from performance mistakes.
In Aim 1, we will develop a novel closed-loop, sound-guided behavior that requires mice to use real-time acoustic
feedback to guide skilled forelimb movements. Then, we will test whether this behavior is dependent upon intact
auditory cortex activity. In Aim 2, we will then explore how auditory cortex integrates acoustic and task-related
information at the neuronal level to determine how errors and predictions are encoded and whether auditory
cortical activity informs future improvements in behavioral outcomes. We hypothesize that auditory cortex
integrates acoustic, motor, and goal-directed information during this skilled sensorimotor behavior and plays a
critical role in error correction and learning both on short and long-time scales. This work will help reveal how
auditory and motor regions of the brain interact during sound-guided behavior and will advance our
understanding of predictive processing in sensory cortex. The implications of these results will lay the
groundwork for future research into how behavioral controlling regions of the brain then process sensory error
information and update behavior during skilled learning."
10901521,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Seasonal influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause several million infections each year in the United States and have
significant economic and health impacts. The rapid evolution of IAVs yields antigenically distinct viruses each
year. Vaccine strains are chosen several months prior to the start of the season, but given the high rate of viral
evolution, predominant strains can change between when vaccine strains are chosen and the start of the season.
This poses as a major challenge in designing effective vaccines. A better understanding of how antigenic variants
arise will improve the ability to anticipate antigenically distinct IAVs. At the global level, there is a clear pattern of
recurring selective sweeps where antigenically novel variants that escape pre-existing humoral responses
dominate in circulation. However, at the individual host level, stochastic effects appear to play a greater role in
shaping IAV evolution. Yet antigenic mutants must arise amongst individuals to circulate globally. Data from the
Lowen laboratory and other groups suggest that transmission may play a role in selecting for IAVs. Based on
these data, I hypothesize that selection of IAV antigenic mutants in the context of pre-existing immunity
acts inefficiently within hosts but efficiently during transmission between hosts. I will be using genetically
barcoded influenza A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2) virus (Tx/12) to address this hypothesis. Tx/12 is a well-studied
virus that was the chosen vaccine strain for the 2014-2015 influenza season. The circulating H3N2 viruses during
this season however were antigenically mismatched to the vaccine Tx/12 strain. This resulting vaccine escape
was a result of the F159S mutation in the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. I will use genetically neutral barcoded
Tx/12 wild type and HA F159S viruses in pre-immunized guinea pigs (i.e., pre-immune) to determine how both
deterministic and stochastic effects shape the antigenic evolution of IAV. I have rescued non-barcoded Tx/12
wild type and HA F19S virus using reverse genetics. I have shown that both viruses grow robustly in guinea pigs
and the HA F159S virus is antigenically distinct from the wild type virus in the guinea pigs. I have also designed
and begun cloning the genetic barcodes in the HA genes of both viruses and started evaluating the vaccine to
induce partial pre-existing immunity to Tx/12 wild type virus in guinea pigs. In Aim 1, I will examine the efficiency
of selection within pre-immune hosts. I will alter the time of introduction of the antigenic mutant and its frequency
in the population. I will monitor wild type and antigenic mutant barcode frequencies and diversity to measure
genetic bottlenecks under these conditions. In Aim 2, I will examine the efficiency of selection between hosts. I
will alter whether the donor or recipient animal has partial pre-existing immunity to Tx/12 wild type and monitor
barcode frequencies and diversity of both viruses in donor and recipient animals. Through these experiments, I
will further our fundamental understanding of the evolutionary processes that govern IAVs which can aid in better
anticipating seasonal variants when designing vaccines."

 Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are estimated to affect 1 in 36 children in the US, yet treatments for ASD remain
limited. Mutations in the transcription factor, FOXP1, have been linked to ASD, yet the precise role for Foxp1 in either
neurodevelopment or ASD remains incomplete. Previous studies of ASD have also shown that the cortex may exhibit
disrupted structure and function. In line with this, we previously created a forebrain specific Foxp1 knockout mouse model
and observed that there were behavioral abnormalities including social deficits, communication impairments, and
hyperactivity. However, the molecular mechanisms that result from Foxp1 loss in early neocortical development remain
unclear. Given the cell-type specific expression pattern of Foxp1 during cortical development, understanding the cell
specific function of Foxp1 is critical for the advancement of our understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, I
propose to evaluate the impact of Foxp1 loss on two aspects of early neocortical development: migration and cell fate.
 First, I hypothesize that Foxp1 loss disrupts radial migration of upper layer neuronal subtypes through their
interaction with aRGC fibers. I will test this hypothesis by utilizing 1) BrdU birth dating to track migration of neurons from
the VZ along with 2) GFAP staining of aRGC fibers and 3) MERSCOPE’s capacity for detecting up to 1000 cell-type
markers at a single time to determine the cell-type specific impact of Foxp1 loss on neuronal migration during upper and
lower layer cortical neurogenesis. Concurrently with this, I will also stain for genes identified as downstream targets of
Foxp1 through the collection of snRNAseq and CUT&RUN data in order to determine the impact of Foxp1’s downstream
targets on migration.
 Secondly, I hypothesize that Foxp1 loss disrupts the timeline of neurogenesis causing changes in neuronal cell fate.
In Aim 2, I will test this hypothesis by leveraging data from Aim 1 to assess the impact of Foxp1 on cell-type and cell fate
during canonical upper layer and lower layer neurogenesis. I will do this by comparing the birthtime of a neuron, indicated
by BrdU, to its cell-fate after two or after seven days. I will also repeat experiments from Aim 1 during the proliferative
and gliogenesis phases of cortical development to determine whether cell fate is altered.
 By completing these aims and receiving training in the methods needed to generate and analyze these data, I will
determine which cell types are most vulnerable to migration and cell fate deficits in a model system relevant to ASD. I will
also provide key insights into the mechanisms of neurodevelopment, migration, and cell fate in the developing embryonic
cortex. This will ultimately provide a critical foundation for the advancement of precise cell type targeted genetic therapies
of neurodevelopmental disorders. Furthermore, I will receive training in cutting edge wet bench technologies, including
cellular resolution spatial transcriptomics, CUT&RUN, and snRNAseq while gaining tremendous experience as a
bioinformatician. This expertise will enable me to continue to advance our understanding of cell type-specific genetic
contributions to development and disease throughout my career."
10901662,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The process of long-term potentiation (LTP), particularly at the hippocampal Schaffer collateral pathway,
has been regarded as one of the most relevant cellular processes underlying learning and memory. Numerous
studies have demonstrated that changes in gene transcription are required during the execution of LTP. However,
it is much less understood regarding how the dysregulation of gene transcription contributes to intellectual
disability and what transcription factors are involved. To approach this question, we gathered preliminary data to
show an elevation of tumor suppressor p53 following the induction of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-
dependent LTP. It has been well-established that LTP requires elevated surface expression of α-amino-3-
hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR). Our data showed that knocking down p53 in
forebrain excitatory neurons diminished the surface expression of AMPAR during LTP and ultimately impaired
learning and memory behavior in mice in vivo. Importantly, we also observed abnormally down-regulated p53 in
two mouse models of intellectual disability. We therefore propose to test the hypothesis that p53-dependent
transcription is required for activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory, and its dysregulation is
associated with intellectual disability. In Aim 1, we propose to characterize how p53-dependent gene
transcription mediates AMPAR surface expression and participates in hippocampal LTP. In Aim 2, we will employ
genetic and pharmacological approaches to restore p53 in two mouse models of intellectual disability with the
intent to improve hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning behavior. We expect our work to facilitate a much
deeper understanding of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and open new avenues for the study and potential
correction of neurological and psychiatric disorders that are associated with intellectual disability."

10906210,"Admin Core: Project Summary/Abstract
A significant overall goal of CAP-IT is to identify and validate immunologically targeted agents for precision
prevention of individuals with increased cancer risk. The CAP-IT Center for RNA Immunoprevention (CRI)
Administrative Core (AC) mission is to ensure that research project/Core teams maintain focus on this overall
goal. The AC will rapidly perform administrative functions that would otherwise serve as rate-limiting bottlenecks,
including IRB/IACUC regulatory compliance and the establishment of MTA/DTAs between multiple project sites.
The AC will integrate CRI U54 into the CAP-IT network and drive intra-network as well as international
collaborations. To ensure CRI's scientific rigor and excellence, we have assembled a scientifically and
administratively outstanding CRI External Advisory Board, including the 2021 Lasker Award winner Dr. Drew
Weissman (U. Penn). The AC shall also seamlessly integrate genomic databases and emerging technology as
shared resources (such as liponanoparticle RNA vaccines and immunopeptidomics) with the CAP-IT U24 DRCC.

The aging process involves a gradual deterioration of physical and physiological
functions, ultimately leading to mortality. Frailty and muscle weakness are prevalent
conditions in the elderly and are strongly associated with negative health outcomes.
Unfortunately, there are no treatments available that can mitigate the potentially reversible
age-associate decline in physical function, although such interventions could have
tremendous impact on the health care system. Recent studies have revealed a strong
correlation between elevated levels of L-kynurenine (L-Kyn) and frailty, muscle weakness,
and neuromuscular junction degeneration in humans, however a causal relationship has
not been tested. L-Kyn is a product of tryptophan breakdown and has been linked to motor
neuron death, skeletal muscle atrophy, mitochondrial dysfunction, all characteristics of
aging. Skeletal muscle plays a critical role in detoxifying L-Kyn into neuroprotective
kynurenic acid via kynurenine aminotransferases (KATs). Interestingly, KAT4, a
mitochondrial isoform, declines with age and distinguishes healthy aging from sarcopenia.
L-Kyn also activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a transcription factor involved
in regulating gene expression and functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Chronic AHR
activation has shown toxicity in various cells but has not been explored in the context of
frailty and age-related physical decline. Based on supporting data, I hypothesize that
elevated kynurenine levels and increased AHR activity play a causal role in the decline of
physical function during aging. In this fellowship, I will use novel genetic mouse models
to test if elevated L-Kyn, skeletal muscle L-Kyn degradation, and AHR activation in muscle
are mechanistic drivers of the decline in muscle and physical function with aging. In
addition to advanced training in aging biology, mitochondrial energetics, and muscle
physiology, a robust career development program including scientific communication and
training for leadership in academia have been developed. This training will prepare the
applicant to become an emerging leading in aging research and attain a tenure-track
position at a research-intensive academic institution."

 An important aspect of inherited risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD) is low executive function and adaptive
behavioral control. Emerging work shows that such executive abilities are related to activity-induced changes
in brain network functional connectivity (FC). We know very little about how inherited AUD risk affects the
large-scale network FC supporting executive functions, and the small body of extant research does not study
how networks dynamically adapt to changing demands.
 Our lab’s long-term goal is to understand inherited brain vulnerabilities for AUD. This application’s
objective is to determine how AUD risks affect brain network FC reconfiguration during mental state
transitions. As informed by our published preliminary findings, our central hypotheses are that (i) inherited
AUD risk involves inefficient FC reconfiguration in transitioning between extremes of cognitive and reward
engagement, and that (ii) these transitional reconfigurations relate to adaptive control in the key AUD risk
domains. Our specific aims are therefore to:
 Aim 1: Determine how FC reconfiguration during transitions between cognitive engagement and low
cognitive load (“rest”) relates to AUD risk factors.
 Aim 2: Determine how FC reconfiguration during transitions between alcohol-cue stimulation (“appetitive
engagement”) and rest relates to AUD risk factors.
 Aim 3: Determine how FC reconfiguration relates to drinking and alcohol-related problems.
 Exploratory Aims: Test for (A) joint appetitive and cognitive task network reconfiguration effects; B)
multiple mediation effects on drinking, and (C) effects related to loss of control drinking.
 Our proposed work uses a novel paradigm and analyses to characterize transitions between rest and states
of cognitive control and alcohol cue exposure. The work is thus poised to discover new fundamental
knowledge about brain network interactions necessary for flexible and adaptive behavioral regulation. Such
data are critical to understanding mechanisms of AUD risk. The findings will also be used to develop
biomarkers of “disease networks” that can be monitored in treatment research for normalization, or that can
predict therapeutic response."
10880663,"PROJECT SUMMARY
About 70% of all ocular infections are caused by bacteria. Each year in the US alone, there are millions of
cases of bacterial keratitis and conjunctivitis. Fluoroquinolones are effective for both treatment and prevention
of these infections, and moxifloxacin is often the drug of choice due to higher intraocular bioavailability
compared to other fluoroquinolones. The newest fluoroquinolone, besifloxacin, has also shown to have some
advantages in treating resistant organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus species and
Pseudomonas species associated with contact lens-related keratitis. Regardless, antibiotic eye drops are
prescribed to be used at least three times per day, and up to once every hour for severe infections. As the
required number of doses per day increases, patient compliance, and thus, treatment efficacy, decreases.
Issues with adherence can lead to sight-threatening complications and potentially contribute to bacterial
resistance. Antibiotic eye drop formulations that are more effective with less frequent dosing are needed to
improve patient outcomes and quality of life and slow the development of bacterial resistance. While eye drops
dominate the ophthalmic market, achieving effective intraocular drug delivery via eye drops is quite
challenging. Tear production, reflexive blinking, and nasolacrimal drainage limit residence time, while
formulation and drug properties can further limit the potential for the rapid intraocular drug absorption needed.
We have developed a mucosal drug delivery technology that increases drug delivery and absorption across
mucosal barriers, termed the mucus-penetrating particle (MPP) technology. Here, we describe an innovative
approach for formulating water-soluble fluoroquinolone antibiotic salts into ion-paired drug-core
nanosuspensions. Our preliminary data demonstrates that a moxifloxacin-pamoic acid MPP nanosuspension
(MOX-PAM NS) provides improved prevention and treatment in a rat model of bacterial keratitis. Importantly,
once daily dosing with MOX-PAM NS was as good or better than three times daily dosing with the commercial
formulation, Vigamox. The goal is to develop eye drop formulations of both moxifloxacin and besifloxacin to
provide broad spectrum treatment options for gram-positive, gram-negative, and resistant bacterial infections.
In Aim 1, we will make further formulation changes in the eye drops to increase intraocular drug absorption and
screen for antimicrobial activity against commercial and clinical bacterial isolates. In Aim 2, we will characterize
the topical drug penetration and efficacy in treating bacterial keratitis in rats. In Aim 3, we will perform full
pharmacokinetic studies, treatment efficacy studies, and topical safety studies in rabbits, which have ocular
size and structure more similar to humans. We anticipate that a reduction in dosing frequency while
maintaining efficacy against a wide range of common bacterial pathogens will have a positive impact on patient
care and quality of life."

The Summer Training as Research Scholars (STaRS) at Boston University (BU) is an established program
designed for outstanding undergraduate and early medical school students from traditionally underrepresented
groups (URG) in the biomedical sciences, with a goal of supporting NIH’s mission to diversify the biomedical
research workforce. STaRS prepares undergraduate scholars to pursue graduate education and careers in
research, as well as increases the readiness of early career medical students to become physician scientists.
Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine and Graduate Medical Sciences are supportive
and proud of the accomplishments of the STaRS Program and its scholars. Our successful outcomes in the past
iteration of the grant include: (1) >80% of undergraduate scholars continuing into higher education, (2) >50% of
medical scholars with continued involvement in research following completion of the STaRS Program, and (3)
high mentor satisfaction with the Program.
This renewal application builds on our previous successes to improve the program’s comprehensiveness and
rigor, and expands its focus to building greater community and a sense of belonging among STaRS scholars. A
few past scholars noted that negative experiences after STaRS discouraged their intentions to pursue biomedical
research careers, so this renewal application focuses on innovative methods to strengthen their confidence,
communities, and sense of belonging to increase their retention in the STEM pipeline. STaRS scholars will
participate in authentic research projects mentored by faculty that work on cutting-edge research, with a
particular focus on disease-oriented projects in heart, lung, blood and sleep disorders and diseases. These
research experiences foster critical thinking skills, help scholars to see themselves as future scientists, provide
a sense of belonging to the greater scientific community, and prepare them for entering a career in research.
STaRS scholars will also participate in career development activities designed to prepare them for pursuing
advanced degrees and careers in biomedical research, including networking with role models in different career
paths within biomedical research. These activities build self-confidence and aim to increase scholars’ ability to
self-assess and plan steps necessary to successfully apply to graduate degree programs and/or advance in their
research careers. Additionally, STaRS will facilitate in expanding scholars’ professional and social network
before, during, and after the Program, to reinforce community building and a sense of belonging, and thus
mitigate attrition from the biomedical workforce. The Program will use these networks to monitor and assess
outcomes of the program and demonstrate its effectiveness, quality, and long-term impact on the career
outcomes of our trainees, as well as its contributions to the diversity of the biomedical workforce."
10902769,"PROJECT SUMMARY
CASK encodes the synaptic protein calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase and is one of the five
most common X-linked genes with de novo variants in developmental disorders. Loss-of-function variants in
CASK result in a heterogeneous syndrome collectively known as CASK-related disorders (CRDs) with hallmark
symptoms including intellectual disability (ID) and epilepsy. These patients, like many other children with rare
neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), are clinically underserved without pharmacotherapies for ID and with
increased resistance to anti-seizure medications. There is a critical need to understand the neuronal
mechanisms of CRDs to identify targets for therapeutics to address this gap. While mouse models of CRDs have
epilepsy, they have not yet been investigated for cognitive deficits, despite ID being the most penetrant symptom
in patients. Conditional Cask KO in inhibitory neurons has recapitulated epileptic phenotypes with preliminary
data suggesting altered synaptic function. Thus, the central hypothesis is that Cask dysfunction in inhibitory
neurons causes both cognitive deficits and epilepsy due to impaired synaptic transmission. This will be studied
through genetic manipulations in combination with various techniques. Aim 1 will test the mouse model for
cognitive deficits and determine the contribution of inhibitory neuron specific Cask KO to the phenotype; Aim 2
will investigate changes in inhibitory neuron pre-synaptic output via paired whole-cell patch clamp; and Aim 3
will determine inhibitory neuron post-synaptic input changes via ex vivo whole-cell patch clamp and how these
changes translate into in vivo neuronal activity via two-photon Ca2+ imaging. The overall goal of this project uses
mouse models to determine how the loss of Cask in inhibitory neurons alters synaptic function to result in disease
pathogenesis and is designed to prepare the applicant for a career as a pediatric neurologist specializing in
treating patients with and studying NDDs. This project furthers the applicant’s long-term goal of understanding
cortical interneuron development and homeostasis and how perturbations result in NDDs, with the end goal of
developing novel therapeutics. The Xue lab has a strong track-record of successful MSTP trainees and conducts
impactful research using mouse models of human NDDs to discover neuronal mechanisms that contribute to
disease. Furthermore, the collaborative training environment of both Baylor College of Medicine and the Jan and
Dan Duncan Neurologic Research Institute provide state-of-the-art technology cores, experts in the field of
NDDs, and a central location in the Texas Medical Center that will facilitate the success of the project and training
of the applicant. The proposed research is expected to elucidate how inhibitory neuron dysfunction contributes
to cognitive deficits and epilepsy in mouse models of CASK-related disorders and the concomitant synaptic input
and output changes that result in the observed phenotypes. This contribution will be significant because the
pathophysiologic alterations identified from this study will guide molecular investigations of therapeutic targets
in addition to contributing to discoveries of common mechanisms of intellectual disability and epilepsy in NDDs."
10904361,"SUMMARY
In atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), chronic inflammation is a major risk factor that remains
unaddressed by currently approved therapies. Existing therapies aimed at curbing ASCVD target lipid metabolic
pathways, and many patients continue to be at high risk of cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction
and stroke. Although inhibition of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β was shown in the CANTOS
trial to reduce adverse cardiovascular events, the concomitant increased risk of fatal infections hindered its
therapeutic viability. Therefore, narrowing the gap between metabolism and immune cell function to discern the
processes governing inflammation resolution in ASCVD—and why they fail with disease progression—is a major
challenge in the field. To that end, we have identified itaconate, a TCA cycle-derived metabolite produced by the
enzyme cis-aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1/IRG1), as a driver of inflammation resolution in atherosclerosis.
Itaconate is induced during microbial infection, and harbors anti-microbial and immunomodulatory functions,
including inhibition of the NLRP3-inflammasome, IL-1β secretion and reactive oxygen production. These
inflammatory pathways contribute centrally to atherogenesis, yet the regulation of IRG1 and impact of itaconate
on plaque immune responses has yet to be studied. In this proposal, we aim to (i) determine the metabolic and
immune processes by which the IRG1-itaconate axis curbs inflammatory responses in atherosclerosis and (ii)
investigate the effects of itaconate and its derivatives on atherosclerosis-associated inflammatory responses in
vitro, and iii) test whether the cell-permeable itaconate derivative 4-octyl-itaconate can reduce plaque burden
and instability in mice. Our studies will use novel mouse models to track itaconate abundance in vivo and
innovative 3D human vascular explants to investigate therapeutic modulation of the IRG1-itaconate axis in
ASCVD. Collectively, these investigations will identify novel mechanisms of metabolic control of local and
systemic inflammation during atherosclerosis and provide a foundation for the design of targeted
immunometabolic therapies for ASCVD."

(ASP) comprised of two transformative and linked opportunities to advance health equity by promoting
community-engaged research (CER) success among ESIs from diverse backgrounds. The ASP strategy was
influenced by two national evidence-based programs, UK institutional data, and a career development model
implemented in three UK ESI cohorts. Sixteen ESIs over four cohorts will be selected to become ASCEND
Scholars and engage in a three-component CER Training Program, followed by an opportunity to deploy their
skills through the CER Pilot Program. The CER Training Program includes multilevel mentorship, scientific and
social networking, and professional enrichment, followed by the CER Pilot Program. UK ASCEND’s CER Pilot
Program will provide the preliminary studies necessary for highly competitive NIH grant applications. To ensure
a pathway for continued inclusive research excellence, we also will offer CER Pilot Projects to eight
postdoctoral fellows in the first and fifth years of the award. Throughout the ASP and in conjunction with the
Community Engagement and Dissemination Core, ESIs will authentically interact with community stakeholders
to successfully undertake research that appropriately and impactfully addresses health disparities. The IDC
has the following aims: (1) Embed diverse health equity research-focused ESIs into the three-component CER
training program and (2) Implement a rigorous CER pilot project program that leads to collaborative and
sustainable interactions with community stakeholders and the successful dissemination of scholarly products,
including publications, presentations, and grant submissions, leading to research success. The IDC benefits
from strong leadership provided by Dr. Kevin Pearson, a senior-level NIH-funded translational researcher who
currently serves as Assistant Dean for Inclusive Research in the UK College of Medicine, Career Development
Leader for an NIH-funded environmental health center, and Director of the UK COBRE pilot program and Dr.
Shyanika Rose, an early-mid career community-engaged health equity researcher who serves as a near-peer
mentor, chairs the Research Committee for the Center for Health Equity Transformation (CHET), and leads
CHET’s Health Equity Grant Programs. Our diverse, experienced, and complementary leadership
team will work to promote excellence in community-engaged health equity research through mentorship,
networking, and professional enrichment, followed by a CER pilot project that will serve as preliminary studies
for publications, presentations, and subsequent NIH grant submissions. Our long-term objective is to increase
the critical mass of early-stage investigators from diverse backgrounds exceptionally capable of undertaking
transformative CER that achieves health equity."

for their integration into what is now known as an “artificial pancreas.” However, the vast majority of T1D patients
still experience difficulty in achieving clinical glycemic targets and as result, develop organ, nerve and vascular

Health disparities in our nation are acute, increasing, and known to be caused by many factors. A multi-
faceted approach by multi-disciplinary teams of scientists is needed to properly tackle this chronic and
growing problem. Increasing the diversity of biomedical research scientists is one key strategy to
address this crisis. With the current deluge of health-related data and a projected 34% growth in the
job market for statisticians from 2019 to 2029 (Bureau of Labor Statistics), now is the time to diversify
our workforce in the specialties of biostatistics and data science. Herein, we plan to expand the pool of
students from underrepresented groups in these disciplines by introducing a new curriculum for
teaching critical skills in biostatistics and data science, LA’s Biostatistics and Data Science Summer
Training Program at the University of Southern California (LA’s BeST @USC), with a focus on current
research challenges in the study of heart and lung disease.
 The Division of Biostatistics in the Department of Preventive Medicine of the University of
Southern California (USC) is uniquely positioned to attract talented undergraduates from
underrepresented groups into these fields due to its success in graduate level training since 1976, its
location in the ethnically diverse LA Basin, its multi-disciplinary research in diverse populations, and
real-life oriented approach to biomedical research. The faculty has expertise in ‘big data’, machine
learning, epidemiological methods, spatial statistics and clinical trials, and has an NIH-funded P01 to
develop novel statistical methods for integrative genomics. Training a diverse workforce of scientists
requires a diverse faculty. A team of faculty from backgrounds including women, Latinx, Japanese
American, and first in their family to attain a college education, who all share a tradition of individual
hands-on research mentorship and extensive portfolios of research grant support in biostatistics,
epidemiology, clinical trials, and electronic health records, is amassed and available to trainees. With
this team, we propose the following specific aims: 1) To identify and recruit high-quality and highly
motivated college undergraduate students from underrepresented groups. 2) To provide the trainees
with courses and hands-on training in biostatistics and data science. 3) To provide mentoring and
professional development training. 4) To track LA’s BeST trainees through completion of their
undergraduate degree, post-graduate education, and to their first employment."

Global knowledge of pre-harvest factors in food safety, particularly regarding water quality, must be ensured that safety
is built into food production to prevent foodborne illness before they begin. Effective measures in protecting the health
of consumers also enhances the value of food with higher economic returns for both domestic and international trade
networks. Especially as global water scarcity pushes towards the use of poor-quality water sources, better understanding
of the connections between water quality and food safety is needed to improve global health and sustainable agricultural
and environmental outcomes. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations will utilize and leverage
its existing government, research, and private sector knowledge networks and associated developed tools to raise
awareness and build on the networks and learning products for introducing innovative techniques and best practices on
land and water management for improved food security.
This project has three core goals, primarily to raise awareness of key stakeholders on the relationship between water
quality and food safety from field-to-fork, across the supply chain. Expert consultation and guidelines will act as the
foundation for targeted trainings on the farm and authorities at the country, regional, and global levels. On the farm best
practices and low-cost agricultural interventions will be developed to mitigate production risks to food safety. On the
regional and global levels, trainings and workshops will focus toward sustainable land and water management strategies
and directed monitoring. The third goal will be targeted pilot projects aimed at in-depth institutional capacity building in
evidence-based technologies, such as Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) techniques and hydrological modeling, to
increase risk-assessment capacity in identifying and tracking waterborne pathogens. Ultimately, this novel approach to
food safety monitoring systems will contribute to global understanding of risk paradigms in preventing foodborne illnesses
and improve cross-collaboration between sectors. Global meetings and technical roundtables will facilitate data sharing
and common risk prevention approaches for a safer global food supply chain."

 HIV-1 RNA Detection
Abstract
HIV/AIDS has become a major public health concern affecting ~37.9 million people worldwide. Early diagnosis
of acute HIV infection during seroconversion window will facilitate early intervention. During antiretroviral
treatment (ART) of HIV-infected patients, it requires frequent monitoring of HIV viral load to confirm treatment
effectiveness, and to identify viral rebound. HIV viral load testing that quantifies HIV viral RNA (circulating HIV
virus) in plasma is the most accurate and reliable approach for the ART monitoring and acute HIV detection.
However, current standard HIV viral load testing methods rely on expensive equipment and well-trained
personnel, limiting their clinical applications in centralized laboratories and hospital environments.
Commercially available immunoassay-based point of care (POC) diagnostic technologies, such as OraQuick®
HIV Self-Test (HIVST), are not effective to detect acute HIV infections, as well as ART failure. As a
consequence, the lack of a simple, rapid, affordable, POC diagnostic tool for HIV RNA detection leaves many
individuals unaware of their condition and impedes timely antiretroviral treatment. To fill this gap, we propose
to develop a low-cost (~ $ 5), rapid (< 35 min), and sensitive (<1,000 copies/mL), clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) biosensing platform for HIV viral load testing using finger-
prick volume (~50 µL) of whole blood. In the R61 phase (Aims 1-3), we will: i) develop and optimize highly
sensitive and specific CRISPR biosensing technology for next-generation nucleic acid-based molecular
diagnostics, and ii) design and fabricate a disposable ""blood-to-answer"", CRISPR biosensing device that
integrates self-powered plasma separation, viral RNA enrichment, and CRISPR biosensing detection. In the
Phase 33 (Aims 4-5), we will systematically evaluate the performance of our integrated CRISPR biosensing
platform, and rigorously validate its feasibility for clinical application by testing HIV clinical samples in the US
and Zambia. If successful, such a simple, rapid, affordable, POC detection platform will enable acute HIV
diagnosis and viral load testing at home and be appropriate for resource-limited settings where HIV is most
prevalent."
10899625,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Healthcare systems around the world, including within the United States, have long-established shortages of trained
caregivers (WHO, 2016; Jones, Liu, Murfield, & Moyle, 2020). The American Health Care Association (2019) states that
“the health care system has experienced a shortage of trained caregivers for critical roles for some time.” This scarcity
directly impacts the 45,800 Long-Term Care (LTC) communities throughout the U.S. (Harris-Kojetin et al, 2016).
Concurrent with this staff shortage, more than half of LTC residents have some form of dementia (Alzheimer’s Association,
2019). These two issues create a serious public health concern, since dementia is associated with a variety of behavioral
expressions, such as aggression, anxiety, and agitation (Cummings, 1997). Behavioral expressions of dementia can be
successfully managed with the use of tailored, psychosocial interventions and communication support (Vernooij-Dassen et
al., 2010; Fazio et al., 2018). Unfortunately, existing staff shortages make the facilitation of such interventions challenging.
 One powerful and often-overlooked approach to ameliorating staffing shortages involves the utilization of retired
volunteers to facilitate interventions for persons with dementia (PWD). Based on the nearly universal love of music and a
promising pilot study, the product to be developed and tested in this STTR will build upon the combined prior work of the
Principal Investigators. Making Connections Thru Music (MCTM), an urgently needed product, will enable retired
volunteers to facilitate an evidence-based music and discussion intervention with PWD. MCTM aims to improve
engagement, enhance quality of life, and reduce behavioral expressions in PWD. The intervention will consist of two main
components: (1) a comprehensive online training course for volunteers, which will provide a general overview of dementia,
demonstrate effective communication strategies to use with PWD, and instruct volunteers to effectively facilitate MCTM
sessions, and (2) an app containing a structured MCTM intervention protocol and toolkit, which will be the means by which
volunteers facilitate MCTM. MCTM will be marketed to LTC communities.
 PHASE 1 SPECIFIC AIMS
The 12-month Phase I project has the following Specific Aims:
 · Aim 1: Improve and expand upon the MCTM training materials / curriculum and the MCTM intervention itself.
 · Aim 2: Produce two MCTM prototype training modules.
 · Aim 3: Produce a prototype of a MCTM tablet-based app.
 · Aim 4: Conduct focus groups to examine feasibility and acceptability of the prototype training modules and app.
PHASE II SPECIFIC AIMS The 24-month Phase II has the following Specific Aims.
 · Aim 1: Finalize the MCTM online training course.
 · Aim 2: Complete development of the MCTM tablet-based app.
 · Aim 3: Conduct a Fidelity Trial of the MCTM intervention.
In the Fidelity Trial, we will examine staff and volunteer adherence to the intervention, engagement/affect levels produced
by volunteer- and staff-led MCTM sessions, and self-reported PWD satisfaction with MCTM."
10899633,"A growing multidisciplinary evidence critically underpins that Porphyromonas gingivalis, a leading pathobiont of
the oral cavity that successfully remodels oral microbial communities to a pathophysiological state, can live in
concert with human gingival epithelial cells (GECs). Epithelial cells are emerged as an integrally important arm
of innate defenses in the oral mucosa, while recent observations suggest that these cells can be exploited as
privileged growth niches and a reservoir by P. gingivalis, which can intracellularly multiply and remain largely
unharmed in GECs. Despite, extensive systems level molecular knowledge exists on the P. gingivalis and GEC
interaction, there is considerably little known on the intracellular life of the organism in this central cell type. We
recently revealed that formation of autophagosomes is critical for the P. gingivalis' intracellular replication and
evasion of the anti-microbial degradation pathways in the GECs. Our novel preliminary findings also support
that lipidation of LC3-C, a key molecule in the `selective autophagy' pathway, which targets intracellular
pathogens is significantly modulated by P. gingivalis under the control of an anti-stress molecule, HSP27.
Further, glutathione peroxidase (GpX1), a major host redox balance enzyme and a regulator of autophagic flux
largely impacted on the global LC3 lipidation state of GECs upon infection. The inhibition of either HSP27 or
GpX1 appears to severely affect the intracellular trafficking and viability of the microorganism. The central
hypothesis is that P. gingivalis induces a distinct form of selective autophagy, which results in
protection of bacterial life and ultimately securing of P. gingivalis' persistence in the oral mucosa. To
test this novel hypothesis, we will pursue two-pronged approach, where we propose the selective autophagy
requires tightly coordinated actions of HSP27 and GpX1 to form autophagosomes that fully function as
protected replicative niches for P. gingivalis. Aim 1 will define the selective molecular machinery that drives P.
gingivalis-containing autophagosome assembly under the control of HSP27 and the mechanisms that disrupt
autophagic flux for the evasion of cellular degradation pathways. Aim 2 will establish the role of GpX1 in
regulating the selective autophagy in infection via redox homeostasis and suppressing autophagolysosomal
machinery. Both aims will employ reductionist primary GECs culture systems to functionally dissect out the
mechanisms and phenotypically characterize the molecular events and sub-cellular components. Aim 3 will
establish the dual significance of these two components using oral epithelial-tissue-specific knockout mice
models. Thus, this proposal aims to fill a significant gap in our fundamental knowledge that is how P.
gingivalis, a facultatively intracellular pathogen, establishes a privileged cellular environment and converts
nutritionally rich epithelial cells into potentially a central reservoir for bacterial growth and persistence in the
oral mucosa. Ultimately, the knowledge gained may translate into molecular strategies that can control or
reduce the intracellular colonization and survival methods employed by this important opportunistic pathogen."

The therapeutic window for treatment of schizophrenia (SZ) with antipsychotics is limited. Excessive dosage
of antipsychotics may lead to dopamine supersensitivity psychosis (DSP), a condition when dopamine D2high
receptors (the active form of the D2 receptor) are upregulated in the mesolimbic system, in turn causing a
need to escalate antipsychotics dose to alleviate the symptoms. To avoid DSP, it is necessary to closely
monitor the changes in D2high. This can be accomplished using a specific D2high receptor agonist, visualized
through positron emission tomography (PET). We have synthesized MCL-524, a highly selective D2 agonist
which is characterized by sub-nanomolar binding affinity to D2high, minimal affinity to other D2-like receptors
or to other dopamine or non-dopamine receptor families, good metabolic stability, and good permeation
through the blood brain barrier. Preliminary data in rats indicate a good ADME profile, with high binding in
the D2-rich striatum, and low binding in other brain regions and peripheral organs. This ligand must be
rigorously and reproducibly characterized before it can be tested in humans. In aim 1, we will complete
preclinical experiments to ensure safety and reliability of MCL-524, including broad off-target binding, ADME
evaluation, and a 14-day toxicology study in rats. In aim 2, we will evaluate the test-retest variability and
biodistribution of [18F]MCL-524 in rhesus monkeys to increase rigor and reproducibility for clinical studies. In
aim 3, we will test in vivo selectivity of [18F]MCL-524 using specific antagonist for D2 (benperidol) and D3
(SB277011A) in PET imaging studies: first we will use micro-PET to assess binding and specificity of
[18F]MCL-524 in the presence and absence of benperidol or SB277011A in control and amphetamine
sensitized rats, an established model of up-regulated D2high receptors, in vivo. In a second approach, we will
test [18F]MCL-524 in analogous blocking studies in non-human primates (macaque monkeys) which are
physiologically closer to humans than rodents, using PET. In aim 4, we will perform studies to support an
investigational New Drug (IND) application, namely GMP synthesis and formulation in the CMC (chemistry,
manufacturing, and control) program to ensure a reproducible and validated method of radiolabeling and
dosage administration. Antipsychotics are the primary means of illness management in SZ, and a better
understanding of the etiology of DSP will allow us to avoid it in patients, improving their overall outcome. The
overarching goal is to develop MCL-524 as a PET radiotracer and a predictive biomarker of dopaminergic
treatment responses in SZ, to minimize the incidence of DSP. Ultimately, this tool will improve patient`s lives
and reduce the socioeconomic burden associated with schizophrenia."
10879800,"ABSTRACT
Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction initiates the development of hypertension (HTN), but the mechanisms are not
fully elucidated. Given that HBP is the leading cause of cardiovascular diseases, it is critical to identify new
opportunities to restore EC function in HTN. In a series of supportive preliminary studies, we identified
progranulin (PGRN), an anti-inflammatory protein, as a novel regulator of EC function and BP.
We recently published that PGRN deficiency induces vascular dysfunction and HTN, whereas treatment with
recombinant PGRN (rPGRN) restores these cardiovascular outcomes via EphrinA2 and nitric oxide (NO)
production. In this proposal, we are extending our knowledge on PGRN and BP and identifying endothelial
PGRN as a new regulator of endothelial function and BP. In preliminary study, we show that Angiotensin II-
induced HTN selectively reduces PGRN in mesenteric EC, whereas mouse with a selective deletion of PGRN in
EC (PGRNEC Cre+) displays endothelial dysfunction, reduced circulating PGRN, and are more susceptible to
develop HTN. In further preliminary studies, we identified a new function of angiotensin converting enzyme
(ACE), which is to degrade endothelial PGRN and limits its vasodilatory function. These data suggest that
reduced endothelial PGRN, driven by ACE-mediate cleavage, is a trigger for EC dysfunction and HTN.
Mechanistically, we found that mesentery EC from PGRNEC Cre+ present suppressed AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK), while overexpressing PGRN in mesenteric EC resulted in exacerbated PGRN secretion followed
by AMPK activation and NO formation, which were blunted by blocking EphrinA2, suggesting that endothelial
PGRN regulates AMPK activation and NO formation via EphrinA2 in an autocrine-dependent manner. In further
preliminary studies, rescuing PGRN expression in mesenteric arteries ex vivo with rPGRN restored the
endothelial function in PGRNEC Cre+, but it failed to produce vasodilation in our novel double knockout mouse –
global PGRN deficient mice with lack of endothelial AMPK. We also demonstrated that AMPK is in oxidized form
in EC from PGRN deficient mice. Finally, Nox1-derived ROS are elevated in EC from PGRN EC Cre+, and that
pharmacological inhibition of Nox1 rescues the endothelial function in PGRN EC Cre+. These findings indicate that
endothelial PGRN maintains EC function and BP by restricting AMPK oxidation and Nox1 activity.
These novel findings inform the central hypothesis of this proposal: Endothelial PGRN, via an autocrine
mechanism, regulates endothelial function and BP and in HTN ACE degrades endothelial PGRN affecting its
bioactivity and contributing to cardiovascular outcomes. This hypothesis will be tested in the following aims:
AIM 1: Determine if reduced endothelial PGRN levels facilitate the genesis and progression of HTN via Nox1-
derived ROS, AMPK oxidation, and EC dysfunction.
AIM 2: Determine if ACE cleaves endothelial PGRN and contributes to endothelial dysfunction and HTN."
10879454,"Placebo treatments can induce clinically significant benefits across a variety of disorders. These
benefits are not due to the treatment itself, which is pharmacologically and physically inert, but to
the effects of the interpersonal context and treatment cues on the patient’s brain. This R01
renewal funds an ongoing program of research that has made fundamental contributions to the
neuroscience of placebo effects. Neuroscientific studies from our group and others have
established that placebo treatments influence cortical-subcortical brain pathways and
neurochemical systems related to the endogenous control of pain, threat, and other affective
responses. Placebo treatments influence internal conceptual models of the situation and its
impact on the self, interacting with learning systems to create stable patterns of affective reactivity.
These systems are also central to symptom progression across mental health, substance use,
and other brain disorders. Understanding placebo effects will thus help improve psychological
and neurological treatments across disorders. Our previous work identifies several significant
gaps important for connecting placebo research to mental health. First, not all placebo treatments
influence affective brain processes in fundamental ways, and it is critical to identify the factors
that underlie deep and durable influences. A key may lie in the nature of the interpersonal
interactions involved. In spite of their critical importance, few neuroscientific studies investigate
the qualities of the care provider and the provider-recipient match that lead to powerful therapeutic
effects. Second, treatments must be studied at a computational level, incorporating models of the
dynamic learning processes that create robust and durable effects. Third is a need to investigate
brain pathways across multiple types of affect relevant for mental health. In Aim 1 (Studies 1-3),
we develop an interpersonal placebo paradigm that allows for the study of provider-recipient
resonance. We probe placebo effects across multiple types of affect, including pain, fear, and
cognitive performance under threat using fMRI (Study 1), autonomic responses (Studies 1 and
2), and some of the first direct neural recordings of interpersonal influence in humans (Study 3).
In Aim 2, we extend this work to consider interactions with the recipient’s mental state. We use
fMRI to compare and study the interaction between placebo suggestions and mindful acceptance
(Study 4), testing the hypothesis that a state of relaxed, mindful awareness will increase
receptivity to placebo suggestions and potentiate placebo effects. Across studies, computational
models test whether placebo treatments, and their enhancement by interpersonal processes,
influence learning dynamics in a way that creates self-reinforcing effects resistant to extinction."
10879538,"Depressive disorders are a leading cause of disability, their first onsets peaks between ages 14-24, and
they are a major concern in adolescent and emerging adult mental health. Although the majority of people
with depression quickly recover with few, if any, recurrences, many suffer from a protracted and highly
impairing illness. These time-limited depression (TLD) and chronic-intermittent depression (CID) groups
appear to differ in developmental etiology, outcome, and treatment response, yet are rarely distinguished in
research, gravely confounding the literature. To make progress in reducing depression burden, it is critical
to delineate the developmental pathways and adult outcomes of these groups. We propose to test a dual
developmental pathways model that hypothesizes that TLD results from severe life stressors. In contrast,
CID develops from a familial liability to low reward responsiveness and childhood adversity, which produce
blunted reward system functioning. Reward functioning may deteriorate further as the illness progresses.
No study to date has examined whether exposure to severe life events and reward responsiveness prior to
the first-onset of depression differentiate between these subtypes, which is essential to evaluating their role
in etiology. Moreover, research has not traced the trajectory of reward function after CID onset to
determine if it continues to worsen. We will build on an ongoing longitudinal study that has followed 550
young women (the high-risk demographic subgroup) from age 14 to 21 years, with > 85% retention. We
propose to follow the cohort through age 26 (2 years beyond the highest-risk period) to accurately
distinguish CID, TLD, and no depression groups. This will allow us to test the dual developmental pathways
model. We also will trace trajectories of reward responsiveness assessed using self-report,
electrophysiology, and a novel magnetic resonance imaging measure of dopamine signaling. Moreover, we
will assess young adult outcomes (occupational and relationship functioning, suicidality, and mental health
service utilization) to evaluate the public health significance of these subtypes. In addition, we will test the
feasibility of developing a predictive algorithm for CID using a comprehensive battery of premorbid risk
factors. Most research on depression to date conflates two markedly different populations, CID and TLD.
We will test a model of their development and etiology by closely following a large sample from early
adolescence to young adulthood, thus starting before and ending after the highest-risk period for
depression onset. No previous study that begun prior to the risk period for depression has charted the
course of depressive disorders at the level of resolution needed to distinguish CID from TLD. Delineation of
these groups can greatly reduce the diagnostic heterogeneity that plagues depression research and
treatment, which will increase the statistical power and interpretability of studies, help guide treatment
development and selection, and direct services to the subgroup that most needs them."
10879671,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of the present application is to define dysbiosis and identify microbial changes that are
predictive of an ecological disruption that ultimately leads to periodontal destruction and to provide mechanistic
insights into why this occurs. The major strength of our approach is our existing biobank derived from U01-
DE021127 “Biomarkers of Periodontal Disease Progression (BPDP) [R. Teles (PI), F. Teles (Co-I) et al.].
Periodontitis is the most common cause of tooth loss among US adults. Further, it increases the risk for systemic
conditions. Proper patient management is critical to minimize tooth loss, allow resource allocation and limit the
potential systemic sequelae of these infections.
By exploring our biobank, we have a unique opportunity to capitalize on existing longitudinal clinical data as
well as subgingival plaque and gingival crevicular fluid samples from periodontitis patients who experienced
disease progression over a 12-month period of monitoring, in the absence of treatment. This approach will reduce
costs of conducting prospective, longitudinal trials. Results from our study will provide mechanistic insight into
periodontal destruction based on human clinical data. Such data does not currently exist.
Aim 1 will determine longitudinal dysbiotic microbial changes that culminate in periodontitis progression versus
microbial signatures that reflect periodontal stability. Aim 2 will utilize computational approaches and predictive
models to gain mechanistic insight into clinically relevant dysbiotic changes.
Strengths of this proposal include: 1) readily available, curated and validated samples coupled with periodontal
data from hundreds of periodontitis patients; 2) utilization of pairs of samples with and without periodontitis
progression, collected from the same subject, 3) Analysis of microbial, immunological and metabolomic
signatures from the same periodontal site, 4) a multidisciplinary study team that includes a PI involved in the
original study (U01-DE021127); and experts in microbiology, immunology, host microbial interactions and
computational biology tools, 5) utilization of state-of-the-art platforms, including whole genomic sequencing,
metabolomics and immunoassasys; 6) application of bioinformatics tools, multi-omics integration and predictive
models that have been established in other fields to provide mechanistic insight in bacterial and host changes
that lead to dysbiosis.
This project supports the NIDCR’s commitment to facilitate the translation of science into clinical practice. Our
contribution to the field will be the generation of models for mechanistic validation that will affect strategies for
the prevention and treatment of periodontitis based on an understanding of dysbiosis in the periodontium that is
lacking."

Opioid-related overdose rates among African Americans have increased exponentially. Given African
American opioid users have the lowest treatment completion rates when compared to other races/ethnicities
there is increased risk for mortality and morbidity. As a result, there is a dire need to better understand this
fatal epidemic among this historically underserved group. Using the theory of Subcultural Evolution and Drug
Use which suggests cultural and generational influences are linked to drug use patterns and risks among
African Americans, the Research Examining Factors Associated with the Opioid Crisis among Underserved
African Americans (REFOCUS) project will employ a within-racial group, mixed-methods design among African
American adults in the community. The overall objective is to better understand the complex structural, social,
and cultural factors that differentially influence NMPOU, other nonmedical prescription drug use and treatment
service use among African Americans. Ultimately, our goal is to gather data that will inform culturally-tailored
interventions to reduce NMPOU and better facilitate initiation and completion of treatment. The REFOCUS
project has three aims: 1) To understand cultural and generational characteristics associated with
NMPOU, other NMPDU, illicit drug use and treatment service use. We will conduct in-depth interviews with
approximately 40 African American nonmedical prescription opioid users stratified by gender and age to
understand NMPOU across the lifespan within the context of lived experience. Using thematic analysis, data
will be gathered to culturally-tailor the survey. 2) To assess structural, social and cultural patterns of
NMPOU, other NMPDU, illicit drug use and treatment service use among 800 (400 = male and 400 =
female) African American NMPO users. We will conduct cross-sectional face-to-face culturally-informed
surveys (modified by information obtained in Aim 1) and drug testing using targeted recruitment and stratified
sampling by age and gender. 3) To pretest messaging generated from initial findings that will inform
targeted interventions specific to African American nonmedical prescription opioid users. We will
conduct in-depth, semi-structured interviews and using health communication techniques, we will develop a
library of cultural, gender, and generational specific messages related to decreasing NMPOU and increasing
treatment engagement and retention. We will test these messages that will be constructed from Aim 1 and Aim
2 data with approximately 40 African American nonmedical prescription opioid users stratified by gender and
age. This pretesting task will prepare us to conduct a fully powered RCT as the next step in our research.
This underrepresented new investigator led project directly aligns with the PAR and NIDA’s priority focus
area of “addressing real-world complexities”. As this high-impact project focuses on a marginalized group
underrepresented in opioid use research and it has the potential to yield insights on ways to culturally-tailor
future interventions for African Americans."
10879618,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant brain tumor and one of the most fatal of cancers, remains
impervious to treatment with the current standard of care (SOC) therapies. Even immunotherapies like immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have failed for GBM despite their success with other cancers. One critical reason for
this failure is that the brain’s GBM tumor microenvironment (TME) is highly immunosuppressive. To change the
GBM microenvironment, over the last period of funding we have been exploring the use of oncolytic viruses
(OV), based on herpes simplex virus type 1 (oHSV). Of relevance, we have completed a “first-in-human” clinical
trial in subjects with GBM. Recovery of the brain tumors after therapy revealed persistence of the oHSV in some
patients, highly significant infiltration of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells with an effector transcriptomic signature, and a
significant correlation between subject survival and changes in T cell metrics. Very interestingly, pre-existent
and/or seroconverted HSV1 serology was a highly significant independent predictor of subject survival,
suggesting the existence of anti-HSV1 T cell memory that could be stimulated by tumor injection with the oHSV
to differentiate into effector T cells that would then aid in the anticancer effect. In fact, we have found that patients
with pre-existent HSV1 immunity or that seroconverted were the ones who were more likely to clear HSV1
antigen from injected GBMs. Two questions arise from these findings: 1- what is the role of antiviral HSV1
“bystander” T cells in therapy efficacy, and 2- what is the significance of oHSV antigen persistence in injected
GBMs? Our overall hypothesis, informed by our clinical trial data, is that oHSV’s antiGBM effectiveness
is based on expansion from “bystander” anti-HSV1+ memory T cells into effector T cells, whose activity
is marked by infiltration and “clearance’ of replicating oHSV previously injected into the GBM. To test
thus hypothesis, we plan to pursue the following aims: Aim 1- Determine if a pre-existent anti-HSV1 memory
T cell population differentiating into an effector T cell population infiltrates syngeneic murine GBMs
infected with oHSV; Aim 2- Determine if antiviral bystander T cells aid antitumor T cells in tumor rejection
upon oHSV administration, and Aim 3- Characterize whether oHSV persistence in tumors stimulates
further effector antitumor T cell responses or leads to terminal exhaustion of T cells. The impact from
these studies will be to significantly inform whether oncolytic immunotherapy depends on pre-existent immunity
to the cognate OV, leaving to avenues for improvements in the next phase of clinical trials for this modality."

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality across the world.
Characterized by crowded detention facilities and limited medical safety resources, US criminal legal settings
(CLS) have experienced some of the largest COVID-19 outbreaks. Persons involved with CLS (PCLS)
additionally experience significant barriers to health care upon release, and often return to environments
impacted by syndemic factors rooted in structural racism: lower vaccine access, fewer testing facilities, medical
mistrust, and higher COVID-19 prevalence. A complex interplay between individual and social network-level
factors may be driving the adverse COVID-19 outcomes among PCLS. But, despite their importance, social
network influences – and the effect of their interaction with individual ands structural factors on COVID-19
testing, vaccination and broader health behaviors – are not routinely examined. To systematically address this
gap, we will leverage two existing RADx-UP studies across eight US states. The “Community Network Driven
COVID-19 Testing Among Most Vulnerable Populations in the Central United States” (C3) study is unique in
that it has collected longitudinal social network data on testing, vaccination and health behaviors among PCLS
in five US states. Additionally, the “COVID-19 Testing and Prevention in Correctional Settings” (CTC) study has
assessed COVID-19 testing, vaccination, and mitigation strategies for PCLS in three US states. We will
integrate the common data elements collected through the CTC project with the network determinants
estimated from the C3 data to develop an agent-based network model (ABNM) – a dynamic systems modeling
technique that provides the ability to simulate emergent interaction between individual behaviors, social
structures, policy implementation, and downstream assessment of population outcomes. The proposed
modeling study will: (1) use machine learning to quantify the impact of network-level influences on COVID-19
testing, vaccination, and health behaviors within PCLS communities; (2) build an agent-based network
modeling (ABNM) platform that integrates the individual common data elements (CDEs) of testing and
vaccination collected from the CTC study and network determinants from the C3 study; (3) simulate the effects
of interventions on COVID-19 vaccination, testing and broader health behaviors in PCLS and their
communities. This approach will provide insight on the potential impacts of network-informed interventions
using RADx-UP data, social network analysis, machine learning, and agent-based modeling to identify
interventions to reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among PCLS and their communities."

Asthma exacerbations are a major cause of disease morbidity and lead to progressive loss of lung function,
airway remodeling, and enhanced disease severity. Their associated economic burden is substantial, totaling
approximately 15 million outpatient visits, 2 million emergency room visits, and 500,000 hospitalizations each
year in the United States alone. Predisposition to asthma exacerbations is influenced by genetics and triggered
by environmental exposures that result in a dysregulated immune response. Viral and bacterial infections are
the leading risk factors for asthma exacerbations. While a few virulent species have been well-studied, a
comprehensive assessment across a range of viral and bacterial stimuli, as well as their interactions with multiple
omics, to understand how these are linked to individual susceptibility has not been performed. Recent
technological advances in Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) have facilitated a high-
throughput, cost-effective evaluation of global virulent exposures, enabling for the first the estimation of
cumulative exposures in the context of asthma exacerbations. As such, our overarching objective is to identify
the impact of prior viral, bacterial, and other virulent exposures on asthma exacerbations and severity by
employing PhIP-Seq profiling coupled with multiple omics (genetics, epigenetics, and metabolomics). Our overall
hypothesis is viral and bacterial exposures interact with host genetics and downstream omics differentially across
individuals; these relationships are relevant to disease exacerbations and will differ across the life course. We
will first characterize lifetime virulent exposures through PhIP-Seq profiling, then identify exposures and multi-
omic variants associated with asthma exacerbations- as well as interactions between these complementary omic
layers- and finally, construct universal and personalized predictive models of the impact of these exposures on
asthma severity through a cooperative learning methodological approach. We will leverage four well-
characterized child and adult asthma cohorts, totaling 4,000 individuals, with existing genetic, epigenetic, and
metabolomic data, and apply novel approaches to data integration. The demographic diversity of these cohorts
allows us to interrogate both life course effects, as well as sex as a biological variable and differences by race
and ethnicity. These results hold unprecedented potential to enlighten the complex relationships between
virulent exposures, omic profiles, and asthma exacerbations, providing novel avenues for more personalized
therapeutic targets and management strategies."

An estimated 1.5 million U.S. young adults are dual users of cannabis and tobacco. Dual users
experience higher rates of dependence and difficulty quitting, compounding their risk of long-
term health problems and posing a unique public health challenge. Drive to obtain and use
substances despite cost is a centerpiece of addiction. Overvaluation of substances is captured
by the concept behavioral economic demand (referred to hereafter as demand). Progress in
preventing and treating dual use among young adults requires studying demand for cannabis
and tobacco in three key areas. First, it is essential to characterize demand for cannabis and
tobacco among users of both substances and understand how demand for each substance
changes over time (Aim 1). Second, critical gaps in our understanding of dual use include not
knowing how the link between demand and substance-specific outcomes, such as dependence
and quit attempts operates among dual users, and whether demand for one substance impacts
outcomes for the co-used substance (Aim 2). Third, the lack of a theory-based, explanatory
model connecting demand to dual use is a barrier to progress in prevention and treatment of
dual use. Social cognitive theory (SCT) is a widely used behavioral health model for
understanding substance use, containing modifiable factors such as expectancies, perceptions
of risk and social acceptability, and identity, which has yet to be applied to dual use of cannabis
and tobacco. This study will identify SCT factors linked with demand and dual use (Aim 3),
providing actionable targets of intervention. Addressing these aims will create significant
progress in preventing and treating a unique public health problem among a high-risk group,
consistent with NIDA’s mission. A prospective, cohort design will be used to measure behavioral
economic demand for tobacco and cannabis, current use of tobacco and cannabis and related
behavioral health effects, and SCT factors among 250 young adults (age 18-25) current tobacco
and cannabis users in San Diego, CA at three, 75-minute visits: baseline, month 6, and month
12. The study will be conducted by an experienced university research lab in San Diego, CA
with a track record of recruiting and retaining tobacco and cannabis users, in collaboration with
an expert in behavioral economic demand measurement and a leading biostatistician. This
project will provide students a high-quality research experience in the execution, analysis, and
reporting of the study, consistent with the R16 aim."

There are more than 2 million Americans with opioid use disorder (OUD), contributing to unprecedented levels
of overdoses and drug-related mortality in the U.S. Several approved medications for OUD (MOUD) are
available, and robust evidence shows them to be more effective than abstinence or psychosocial therapy alone
in helping individuals achieve and maintain remission. Yet, less than 20% of individuals with OUD receive any
MOUD. Buprenorphine maintenance therapy (BMT) holds significant potential to increase access to treatment
as the only MOUD available in a primary care setting that does not require patients to endure withdrawal.
Fewer than 7% of physicians prescribe the drug, and more than 40% of U.S. counties do not have a BMT
provider, with access further restricted in rural and otherwise underserved areas. It seems that provider-,
patient-, and system-level barriers are fueling an “implementation chasm” between the evidence-based
practice for OUD and its actual delivery. The objective of this application for a NIDA Mentored Research
Scientist Development Award (K01) is to support a new assistant professor in the Emory University Rollins
School of Public Health to become a national leader in pioneering innovative, multilevel research on how to
close this implementation chasm and reduce drug-related harms and inequities in those harms. To that end,
this K01 application provides training opportunities in Implementation Science, spatial analysis, qualitative
methods, and addiction medicine. The research aims are designed to reinforce these new skills, using mixed
methods and a conceptual model derived from Implementation Science (i.e., the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research and the Diffusion of Innovations theoretical model) to investigate the modifiable
barriers and facilitators to BMT adoption in primary care. Aim 1 uses spatial analysis to develop annual,
county-level measures of OUD and BMT treatment availability and determine the local correlates of unmet
treatment need, both overall and for disparity populations. Aim 2 observes the diffusion of BMT prescribing
among primary care providers, measuring the significant predictors of BMT adoption, including individual-,
practice-, system-, and community-level factors. Aim 3 will identify “positive deviant” counties—i.e., those with
substantial increases in BMT prescribing over time—and conduct in-depth qualitative case studies to
determine the processes associated with successful BMT implementation and sustainment, including novel
models of care and local adaptations of best practices. These studies will provide actionable recommendations
for communities and health systems seeking to increase access to evidence-based care for OUD. The
protected time, resources, and mentorship available through this K01 award will enable Dr. Yarbrough to
emerge as an independent and leading researcher in substance use disorders and Implementation Science
who will help close the implementation chasm for MOUD treatments and improve outcomes for opioid use
disorder patients."

This project's goal is to develop an assessment that captures the process of shared decision-making
(SDM) for persons who cannot advocate for themselves because they lack the cognitive capacity to
decide for themselves and the ability to communicate their wishes. Current SDM assessments are not
designed for these individuals and generally focus on encounter outcomes rather than the process by
which SDM unfolds. To address this knowledge gap, a team of multi-disciplinary researchers, healthcare
stakeholders, and care partners will collaborate to design and test the observer-rated Standardized Process
Assessment of Relationship-Centered Shared Decision-Making (SPARCSdm), informed by our
relationship-centered SDM process model. In Aim 1, we will observe, interview and analyze patient-
practitioner-care partner triad encounters where decisions are made. These observations will be used to
define modifiable collaboration and information exchange skills, identify items and rating scales for the
SPARCSdm, and design a prototype assessment including administration procedures. In Aim 2, assessors
will be trained using an online, competency-based training developed specifically for this project; once
trained, they will observe videotaped SDM encounters and separately score care partners and practitioner
on the SPARCSdm. These data, analyzed using the many facets Rasch model (MFRM) to adjust for
assessor severity/leniency and encounter complexity, will provide preliminary evidence of SPARCSdm
psychometrics, facilitate appraisal of the assessment's conceptual and structural validity, and inform
refinements of the online training. In Aim 3, we will apply the Knowledge to Action implementation
science strategy to scale up the prototype for future testing by identifying supports and barriers, usability,
and acceptability. This project advances care for persons with chronic disabilities and their care partners
by developing a process assessment that is relationship-centric, inclusive of multiple perspectives, and
user-friendly. As such, it is highly responsive to AHRQ's request for projects that develop an SDM
process assessment, informed by a conceptual model, to capture multiple perspectives for priority
populations such as persons with disabilities who need chronic care. This assessment is needed because
clinical supervisors and medical educators currently struggle to identify when SDM has taken place and
which practitioners and care partners need support with SDM skills. Attention to usability and integration
of supports and barriers to implementation throughout the design process ensures this project will
effectively set the stage for larger scale testing of the SPARCSdm, and longer-term, for measuring the
effectiveness of intervention programs aimed at improving SDM."

Consistent with the NHLBI Strategic Objective to “develop and optimize novel…therapeutic strategies to prevent,
treat, and cure heart, lung, blood and sleep diseases,” this proposal aims to develop, refine, and preliminarily
test a comprehensive, personalized, media-augmented telehealth intervention designed to improve sleep health
among shift workers. Approximately 20% of the US workforce engages in some form of shift work. Shift work is
common in essential occupations (e.g. nursing, transportation, food service). Shift work is associated with
elevated risk for cardiovascular disease, stroke, multiple cancers, metabolic disorders, depression, driving
accidents, medical errors, and all-cause mortality. One modifiable factor that contributes to increased risk for
disease, accidents, errors, and death among shift workers is poor sleep health, defined as the multidimensional
pattern of sleep and wake which promotes optimal health and wellbeing. Poor sleep health in shift workers
manifests during both sleep (e.g., insomnia symptoms, short sleep duration) and wake (e.g., fatigue, sleepiness,
executive function, depression). The proposed study seeks to improve sleep health among shift workers by
developing, refining, and testing a novel intervention, termed Shift Worker Intervention for Sleep Health (SWISH),
which will integrate existing effective interventions into a comprehensive program that addresses the
constellation of sleep health problems experienced by many shift workers. The aims of this research are to: 1)
iteratively refine and finalize the structure and materials of SWISH; 2) examine feasibility and acceptability of
SWISH compared to delayed treatment control in a randomized pilot study; 3) preliminarily test the effect of
SWISH on sleep health parameters; and 4) preliminarily test the effect of SWISH on wake time functioning. The
proposed research plan will be the first step towards building an intervention that can contribute to the
improvement and reduce the significant societal burden of poor sleep health among shift workers. This research
has potential far-reaching public health implications, as the sleep health of shift workers has impacts beyond the
individual (e.g., patients under a nurse's care). The candidate's planned training activities are also vital to the
completion of this project. As outlined in the Career Development Plan, a multidisciplinary team of experts will
provide the candidate with advanced training and mentoring in key areas including clinical trial design, conduct,
and reporting, circadian rhythms biology and circadian interventions for shift work, implementation science, and
development of rich, engaging media products to support therapist-led interventions. The training plan includes
strong mentorship, seminars and didactics, formal coursework and institutes, hands-on training, manuscript and
grant preparation, and attendance at scientific meetings. The proposed research project leverages the
candidate's rigorous prior research and clinical training in sleep health assessment and interventions while
providing necessary additional training to set the stage for the candidate to become an independent clinical
investigator focused on increasing accessibility for sleep health interventions in underserved populations."

Gene expression programs are dynamically regulated by the accessibility of chromatin for
transcription factor (TF) binding, but how TFs recognize specific regulatory regions occluded by
nucleosomes remains unclear. Certain TFs, termed pioneer factors, can recognize their target
sites within nucleosomes, leading to the opening of chromatin. By priming cis-regulatory
elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneers serve as gatekeepers to
cellular differentiation. Although pioneers can bind nucleosomal sites, they bind only a subset of
their potential recognition sites in the genome that typically varies across cell types, thus
indicating their interplay with sequence, epigenetic or other cellular features.
Despite the importance of pioneer factors, what restricts pioneer binding is poorly understood.
Little is known about how the sequence context of their sites in nucleosomes, the presence of
histone variants or post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones, or interactions with
cofactors or chromatin readers that recognize those PTMs might influence pioneer binding to
nucleosomes. No high-throughput technologies have been developed to survey the impact of
these many parameters on TF pioneer binding.
In this project, we will develop novel, high-throughput biochemical assays to investigate how
nucleosomal sequence context, histone variants or histone PTMs influence pioneer binding of
human TFs to nucleosomes. We will also investigate the interplay of pioneers, cofactors, and
chromatin readers in pioneer binding. Results from these biochemical assays will be validated in
vitro and used in analysis of in vivo genomic data in human cells to understand how these
various features contribute to TF pioneer binding in cells.
As pioneer factors play crucial roles at the top of regulatory hierarchies, these results will aid in
understanding how gene regulation of cell states is encoded in the genome and the
mechanisms by which it is read out."
10883754,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In order to accurately store and retrieve memories, information about novel or salient experiences must be
flexibly integrated into existing memory networks while maintaining the stability of previously stored memories.
To accomplish these goals within the same circuit, the hippocampus must encode novel experiences and retrieve
neural representations of familiar ones in parallel. Disruption of this balance between encoding and retrieval may
underlie memory deficits observed in numerous neurological disorders that affect the hippocampus. The dentate
gyrus (DG) and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus are often considered to be essential for memory encoding
and retrieval, respectively. Encoding and retrieval in these regions rely on two complementary computational
processes, pattern separation and pattern completion. Pattern completion in CA3 allows for a full memory to be
retrieved despite incomplete inputs, while pattern separation in the DG prevents interference between similar
memories during encoding. Mossy cells, a relatively understudied DG cell type, occupy a key node in the DG/CA3
circuit and mediate communication between these areas. Mossy cells, which receive extensive neuromodulatory
inputs, may regulate DG/CA3 activity to enhance encoding of novel experiences and retrieval of familiar
experiences. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that mossy cells promote encoding of novel environments
by regulating the activity and neural computations of the DG/CA3 circuit. Technical limitations have prevented
extensive study of mossy cells in vivo, and it is unknown how exploration of novel environments affects DG/CA3
circuit dynamics. I will perform two-photon calcium imaging in the dorsal hippocampus of mice as they explore
novel and familiar virtual tracks to evaluate the role of mossy cells in encoding novel environments and regulating
DG and CA3 activity. In aim 1, I will directly record activity from mossy cells to determine how their spatial activity
differs in novel and familiar virtual environments. In aim 2, I will examine how mossy cells regulate communication
between the DG and CA3 by recording granule cell and CA3 pyramidal cell population dynamics while
optogenetically inhibiting mossy cell activity. Finally, in aim 3, I will generate a computational model of a
combined DG/CA3 circuit to directly examine how pattern separation and pattern completion within this circuit
are regulated by mossy cells. Understanding the neural basis of memory encoding and retrieval is an
instrumental step toward lessening the burden of memory impairments observed in numerous cognitive
disorders. The results of this proposal will provide fundamental insights into the role of mossy cells in regulating
these essential memory processes."

Morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 is the result of an exaggerated inflammatory response causing severe tissue
and organ damage. However, the biological mechanism for why some individuals progress from initially stable
to ultimately critical condition has not been fully elucidated. This work proposes that the immune response at the
site of infection during the earliest stage of infection plays a deterministic role on subsequent pathology; namely
that a delayed or suppressed type 1 interferon response in the respiratory mucosa within the first few days of
infection permits rapid viral proliferation with minor symptoms, but eventually leads to the high viral loads and
exaggerated inflammatory response seen later in disease. Further, the proposed project will test whether a
delayed interferon response is the result of previously documented age-related dysfunction. It also seeks to
determine whether direct SARS-CoV-2 mediated disruption of host splicing can also suppress interferon
signaling in the early stage of infection. To do this, the study will leverage a unique set of longitudinal paired
nasal swab and saliva samples from individuals who are initially negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but become
infected while being prospectively sampled with high frequency (twice per day) as part of an IRB-approved (#20-
1026) COVID-19 household transmission study that the applicant co-designed and co-leads (since August 2020)
at the California Institute of Technology. The transcriptome present in these samples will be analyzed to measure
gene and isoform expression from which leukocyte recruitment and activation, including through interferon
signaling can be inferred, through the elusive early stage of infection and the full course of the illness.
Longitudinal differential expression and differential splicing paths in patients as young as age 6, and of advanced
age will be assessed to identify whether age-related differences in immune response (in particular, interferon
signaling) lead to more rapid increases in viral load, and subsequent symptom severity. In addition, from an RNA
sequencing library enriched for nascent pre-mRNAs, splicing defects such as intron retention will be measured,
to identify whether virus-mediated disruption of splicing also leads to a suppressed or delayed early interferon
response permissive of rapid viral proliferation. COVID-19 is a public health threat, and in line with the mission
of the NIAID, the results of this study can provide mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2
infection, to potentially identify novel or more efficient targets for the prevention or treatment of severe disease.
In addition, the proposed project offers an excellent training opportunity for the applicant to gain knowledge and
skills in immunology, virology/coronavirus biology, mechanisms of human RNA splicing, and generation analysis
and interpretation of RNA sequencing data, with mentorship from Dr. Rustem Ismagilov, Dr. Akiko Iwasaki, and
Dr. Mitch Guttman, who are experts in the aforementioned fields."
10879246,"Project Summary
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the recommended treatment option for patients with Barcelona Clinic
Liver Cancer Stage B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but may also be used as a bridge therapy in HCC patients
who are potential transplant candidates. Additionally, this locoregional therapy is frequently used for the
treatment of other primary (cholangiocarcinoma) and metastatic liver cancers (colorectal cancer, breast cancer,
melanoma, neuroendocrine tumors, and some soft tissue sarcomas). Incomplete TACE treatment (observed in
up to two-thirds of patients) is defined as persistence of enhancing areas inside the treated lesions seen at the
first imaging follow up. Initial guidelines recommend follow-up contrast-enhanced MR or CT imaging 4-6 weeks
after all tumor-bearing areas have been treated. The inherent limitations of these modalities initially led our group
to pursue the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging as an alternative for assessing HCC
response to TACE earlier as part of this NIH grant R01 CA194307. Our prospective multi-center trial
demonstrated an improved sensitivity for detecting residual disease following TACE relative to clinical standard
of care CT/MR imaging (91.4% vs. 67.8%; p≤0.008) and an ability to identify patients requiring retreatment as
early as one-week post treatment. Importantly, data from this grant has in part lead to the recent decision by the
American College of Radiology to incorporate CEUS into its liver imaging reporting and data system (LI-RADS)
treatment response algorithm, supporting full clinical adoption.
In this funding cycle, we plan to build on this momentum to expand the role of CEUS within TACE while also
overcoming limitations in our prior study. First, we plan to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CEUS for
assessing TACE response in non-HCC tumors (which vary in vascularity and now makes up the majority of
cases at many institutions). Secondly, we plan to investigate the ability and diagnostic performance of TACE
intra-operatively. While treatment will not be altered as part of this proposal, once properly validated this could
enable immediate tumor retreatment and improve the overall response rates of TACE. Thirdly, we plan to
investigate a variety of advanced ultrasound techniques including improved volumetric CEUS, frequency
spectrum analysis, and off-line techniques for improving resolution of vascular structures. We hypothesize these
approaches will improve on the suboptimal specificity observed in our initial studies. Finally, we propose to
quantify tumor vascular morphology and blood flow dynamics prior to treatment as a means for predicting
treatment response (and ultimately personalizing the selection of locoregional therapy). Ultimately, this work will
continue to expand the role of CEUS in the setting of TACE by demonstrating applicability to a variety of solid
tumors, guiding treatment, and improving on the technique’s overall specificity."
10879253,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Background: Contraceptive care is an essential component of maternity care. While patient-centeredness is a
key aspect of the quality of contraceptive care, significant evidence suggests that many pregnant and
postpartum (hereafter “peripartum”) individuals do not receive patient-centered contraceptive care and that
marginalized groups are disproportionately at risk of poor experiences. These poor experiences affect
contraceptive use, birth spacing and risk of adverse birth outcomes. Addressing current shortcomings in
peripartum contraceptive care requires robust metrics grounded in patient-centeredness and health equity, but
no such measures currently exist. Commonly used measures of peripartum contraceptive care focus only on
the clinical outcome of contraceptive provision. Assessing quality through this measure alone—as opposed to
alongside a measure of patient experience—can have unintended consequences of incentivizing the promotion
of contraception use or specific method types over individual patients’ preferences. Thus, there is critical need
for new measures that can capture the patient-centeredness of contraceptive care among peripartum
populations, overall and among key subgroups at disproportionate risk of non-patient-centered care.
Approach: The objective of this proposal is to develop a novel, psychometrically validated measure of the
patient experience of peripartum contraceptive care, the Patient-centeredness of Peripartum Birth control
Counseling (PPBC) measure. To achieve this objective, we will first adapt an existing patient-reported outcome
measure to the unique peripartum context, using modified Delphi methods with patient and expert stakeholders
and cognitive interviews with patients (Aim 1). We will then administer the prototype measure developed in Aim
1 to a large sample of peripartum individuals, to assess and confirm factor structure, evaluate reliability and
external validity, and develop a refined measure of the patient experience of peripartum contraceptive care
(Aim 2).
Impact: Findings from this proposal hold promise to ultimately transform the ability of health systems and
researchers to understand and promote patient-centered, equitable peripartum contraceptive care delivery and
thereby improve health outcomes for the 4 million mothers and infants receiving perinatal care in the U.S.
annually."

Research Center (MDSRC) will coordinate the activities within and outside the Center, as well
as promote an interactive and collaborative research environment. The administrative
responsibilities of Core A include the following: organization of the flow of project information;
distribution of research effort; allocation of budgetary and other resources; preparation of annual
budgets and projections; scheduling and facilitation of monthly Wellstone Neuromuscular
Conference meetings; promotion and coordination of community outreach projects (including
the annual Patient and Family Conference); and consultation with the Dean of the University of
Iowa Carver College of Medicine regarding progress, scientific direction, administrative issues
and concerns, and future plans. The scientific responsibilities of Core A include the following:
integration, coordination, and direction of research projects as needed; consultation with
advisors concerning the importance and progress of Center research relative to other
developments in the area of muscular dystrophy; identification of seminar speakers and
coordination of their participation and contributions to the Center; and hosting of an annual
conference for patients and their families. This Core will also facilitate expansion of our
collaboration with national and international leaders in the field of congenital and limb-girdle
muscular dystrophies, particularly researchers and clinicians at other Wellstone Centers
throughout the United States. The Center Administrator is also responsible for coordinating the
Wellstone Steering Committee Face-to-Face Meeting when this is hosted by the University of
Iowa, coordinating both the patient and family tours and the meetings among Core Directors
and Project Leaders that take place during this event."
10884482,"CORE C SUMMARY
The overall goal of Core C is to foster the growth and development of the next generation of
neurologists, and basic and translational scientists in an environment where basic scientists and
clinicians interact regularly to advance knowledge about muscular dystrophy. Specifically, each
year Core C will support training activities for two Medical Student Fellows, a Postdoctoral
Fellow, and an Undergraduate Research Fellow. The medical and postdoctoral fellows will be
mentored by both Core Co-Leads (Drs. Campbell and Mathews), and the undergraduate fellow
will be mentored by one of them. The educational efforts of the Center are vital because there is
an urgent need for basic scientists and clinicians who can partner to develop, test and
implement muscular dystrophy therapies. By establishing the Medical Student Fellowship, we
will foster interest in academic child neurology (with a neuromuscular focus). This full-time
fellowship will enable two medical students per year to participate in a range of MDSRC
activities including care of muscular dystrophy patients in clinic, evaluation of patients
participating in Project 2 under the supervision of Dr. Mathews, interpretation of muscle biopsies
with Dr. Steven Moore and exposure to clinical trials. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowship will
train scientists in the basic research of muscular dystrophy, by providing a PhD, MD, or MD/PhD
graduate with an intensive research experience in Dr. Campbell's laboratory. This experience
will be complemented by observation of patient care in a clinical setting, enhancing the fellow's
understanding and appreciation of the clinical side of translational research. The Undergraduate
Research Fellowship is designed to provide an intensive research experience in an MDSRC
laboratory that will encourage students to pursue careers in translational science. This
fellowship is awarded to students who are currently enrolled at the University of Iowa. These
individuals will work closely with a postdoctoral advisor in an MDSRC laboratory. All trainees will
participate in the monthly Wellstone Neuromuscular Conference, where clinical fellows and
faculty present interesting cases with discussion of literature and scientific trainees join in
discussion. Current Wellstone trainees will actively participate in the Family and Patient
Conference hosted by Core A by presenting their research and interacting one-on-one with
patients and families. Web-based interactive cases will extend neuromuscular training to the
wider community. Through these activities, Core C will accelerate the education mission of the
MDSRC and provide a vibrant training environment for clinician scientists."
10884483,"Project Summary: Tracking & Evaluation Core 
The Tracking and Evaluation (T&E) Core supports the LA CaTS Center’s (LA CaTS) overarching vision to 
improve health outcomes and address health disparities in Louisiana by providing evaluative assessments to 
LA CaTS leadership that facilitate data-driven decisions for shaping initiatives and directing resources that 
align with the Center’s mission and theme. Through partnerships with 11 member institutions, LA CaTS has 
established a statewide infrastructure for developing and supporting clinical and translational (CT) research in 
Louisiana. LA CaTS initiatives are developed and implemented through the efforts of LA CaTS team members 
working in 10 Cores located across the state. Since inception, LA CaTS programs have given priority to 
supporting studies and initiatives that a) focus on disease states prevalent in Louisiana including diabetes, 
obesity, cancer and cardiovascular disease and b) have potential for addressing health disparities and 
improving health outcomes in the state’s underserved populations. With the onset of COVID-19 in 2020, a 
nationwide focus was placed on health disparities and associated co-morbidities, many of which are LA CaTS 
priority disease states. This has increased the long-term importance of the LA CaTS Center’s objective for 
supporting CT research that address diseases that have disproportionately negative impacts on vulnerable and 
underserved populations. LA CaTS leadership must also ensure a) the effective use of LA CaTS Center 
resources; b) an integrated approach to strengthen capacity for cross-Core communication and collaboration; 
and c) flexibility to quickly revise or develop initiatives based on needs. For this upcoming 5-year cycle the T&E 
Core Specific Aim is to Strengthen and oversee the execution of an internal tracking and evaluation plan that 
ensures ongoing monitoring, informative interim assessments, flexibility to pivot priorities, and an annual 
evaluation at both the Core-level and Center-wide level for new and continuing initiatives. To accomplish this 
Aim, the T&E Core will use mixed methods, including relational, developmental, and utilization-focused 
approaches to collect data and develop assessments. Evaluation foci include a) assessing Center strengths, 
progress toward achieving specific aims and milestones and identifying opportunities for development; b) 
growth in CT research focused on underserved populations and health disparities; and c) assessing use, 
quality and costs of programs, resources, and services; budget management, resource allocation, program 
development or improvement, and challenges. Close attention will be given to tracking a) growth in LA CaTS 
efforts to address health disparities and improve health outcomes in Louisiana’s underserved population and b) 
Core initiatives that reflect the Center’s commitment to diversity and collaboration across member institutions 
and with CTRs and CTSAs. The T&E Core will a) adapt existing tools and processes and/or b) 
develop/implement new data collection, tracking or visualization tools or processes based on need. Completing 
this Aim will provide assessments that demonstrate the LA CaTS Center’s active pursuit of the long-term 
vision."
10884485,"Project Summary: Cyberinfrastructure Enhancement Core 
The vision for the Cyberinfrastructure Enhancement (CE) Core is to strengthen the partner network, scale clinical 
accomplishments made in overcoming health disparities during COVID-19 and create a sustainable growth 
model for clinical and translational infrastructure and workforce development in our state. To accomplish this 
vision, we will provide, update, and maintain “state of the art” computing and informatics resources; further 
developing the infrastructure to support the clinical and translational research projects of LA CaTS investigators 
with the goal of reducing Louisiana's chronic disease burden. We will accomplish our goals by pursuing the 
following specific aims. Aim 1. To facilitate clinical and translational research administration and data 
management using secure and proven cyberinfrastructure resources and tools, providing investigators a 
common ground through which to conduct research. We will accommodate hybrid working scenarios brought 
about by the COVID pandemic, by adapting such a toolset to be as effective remotely, as it is from the 
researcher's clinic or office. Aim 2. Provide resilient video conferencing resources to support telehealth, 
educational, and community engagement efforts across the state which will enhance communication during the 
COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. CE will leverage the high-speed networks of Louisiana Optical Network 
Infrastructure (LONI) and a palette of proven technologies to support investigators and communities with known 
health disparities and poor access to information and care. Aim 3. To leverage existing web-based tools for 
disseminating general information and for enhancing communication among all LA CaTS cores. CE will provide 
and support an advanced central coordination point for both internal and external communication that will serve 
as the primary repository of information about the LA CaTS Center for technical and lay audiences alike. The 
completion of these aims will significantly enhance and support investigators in their goal to improve health 
outcomes and address disparities in Louisiana by providing a wealth of computing resources that will greatly 
facilitate their research. Tighter collaboration with all cores will yield a more tailored approach highlighted by 
adoption, extension, and customization of available applications as well as the required infrastructure to provide 
scalable and reliable cyber solutions for all LA CaTS investigators."
10884487,"Project Summary: Ethics and Regulatory Knowledge Core 
The overarching goal of the Ethics and Regulatory Knowledge (ERK) Core of the Louisiana Clinical and 
Translational Science Center (LA CaTS) is to create a unified systematic approach to the conduct of clinical and 
translational research across Louisiana. We will build on the successful research infrastructure established 
during the 1st and 2nd funding cycles by expanding Core services to a wider variety of researchers at more sites. 
The ERK Core proposes to achieve the following goals: 1) Advance the reliance review process among all LA 
CaTS institutions. As part of achieving this goal, the ERK Core will take the next steps in improving IRB 
processes by integrating a procedure for early determination of whether a data analysis project is appropriate 
for regulatory reliance. 2) Continue to make contacts with Regulatory/IRB offices at partner institutions to 
implement a state-wide regulatory network to include institutions not part of LA CaTS. This initiative will support 
the expansion of regulatory reliance review and will greatly enhance efforts across the state to support multi- 
institutional and multi-disciplinary projects designed to address health outcomes and disparities. 3) Further 
enhance the LA CaTS mission to facilitate initiation, conduct, and completion of trials by aligning the ERK Core 
activities as part of a Disease Focused Interest Group in close coordination with the Community Engagement 
and Outreach Core. Our Specific Aims are designed to improve the regulatory process and screen early for any 
potential ethical issues related to the research projects before they go into implementation in the community. 
Aim 1. Continue to provide regulatory support through consultations by the Core leaders and institutional liaisons 
to 1) investigators and research staff and 2) the regulatory Review Committees (IRB and IACUC) at each LA 
CaTS institution. Aim 2. Continue to incorporate ethics and regulatory resources into the training and 
professional development of investigators at all LA CaTS institutions with a focus on training new investigators 
and our Roadmap Scholars on the ethical and responsible conduct of research and research integrity. Aim 3. 
To establish and maintain a research participant advocacy board, a subgroup of the ERK Core Working Group, 
which will act as a sounding board for potential research participants by serving as a human research participant 
advocacy resource. We will accomplish these aims by: 1) further strengthening the connections among 
institutional IRB (and other regulatory) offices in order to create a network of ethics and regulatory experts and 
utilize the reliance mechanism outlined in the research strategy; 2) providing formal and informal instruction in 
scientific research integrity and the responsible conduct of research; and 3) addressing social and economic 
barriers to participation in the research effort and promotion of the importance of broad community participation 
in research that is respectful of community concerns through a new advisory board."
10884490,"Project Summary: Health Literacy 
The overarching goal of the Health Literacy (HL) Core of the Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science 
Center (LA CaTS) is to infuse HL, and Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) into clinical research to improve 
health outcomes and reduce disparities among Louisiana’s most vulnerable populations. During the previous 
funding cycles, the Core was highly effective in embedding HL principles in clinical research projects both within 
and outside LA CaTS institutions to increase patients’ ability to obtain, understand, and use health information 
and services as well as participate in clinical trials. The HL Core has enabled collaboration between LA CaTS 
investigators and Federally Qualified Health Centers, as well as faith-based and civic organizations, in order to 
infuse HL principles in COVID-19 testing and vaccine outreach projects targeting vulnerable populations across 
the state. We have expanded our regional and national collaborations to include COVID-19 related research with 
the University of Texas at Houston CTSA. Specific aims for this next cycle are designed to expand our network 
to more investigators within and outside LA CaTS institutions to include HL principles and SDOH in their clinical 
research to improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities: Aim 1. Enhance and expand trust-building 
relationships with historically excluded populations to understand their specific needs, barriers, and strategies to 
reduce health disparities. Aim 2. Collaborate with investigators at LA CaTS institutions to improve vulnerable 
patients’ understanding and use of new health technologies that improve management of chronic diseases, 
medication adherence, preventive care and recruitment in clinical trials, particularly in rural areas. Aim 3. 
Network within LA CaTS, with CTRs, CTSAs in our region and nationally, and with health agencies within the 
state, to provide equitable recruitment to clinical trials for historically excluded populations (rural and inner-city 
communities, diverse race/ethnicity, LGBTQ, formerly incarcerated individuals) to more fully address health 
disparities, and SDOH to improve health outcomes. We will accomplish these aims by: 1) expanding HL training 
to include literacy and culturally appropriate use of health technologies such as patient health education on digital 
platforms, patient electronic portals and digital apps to increase ongoing engagement with vulnerable 
populations; 2) advising investigators in developing and sustaining trust in relationships with vulnerable 
populations and community clinics, and agencies to address health disparities and improve participation in 
clinical trials and health outcomes; 3) continue to collaborate with investigators within LA CaTS to include 
Hispanic, rural, and other disadvantaged populations. These aims are designed to include a wide net of 
stakeholders to design and evaluate acceptable and feasible research strategies to improve access, 
understanding, and use of health information and services to improve the health of vulnerable populations."
10884491,"Project Summary: Professional Development Core 
 Louisiana citizens experience significantly higher rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes/obesity, and 
cancer with significant disparities between subgroups of citizens. Unfortunately, there are 
not adequate numbers of investigators proficient in Clinical and Translational Research to address and diminish 
these health disparities. The overall objective of the Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science (LA CaTS) 
Center Professional Development Core (PD Core) is to educate and train early-career and senior academic 
faculty state-wide to pursue clinical/translational research focused on improving health outcomes and reducing 
health disparities in Louisiana. The PD Core provides a degree-granting training program for early-career faculty 
(Scholars), a Masters in Clinical Research (MSCR), which provides mentorship, and access to a variety of 
educational research resources to aid Scholars from different health professions throughout the state. The PD 
Core research plans are based on the following specific aims: (1) further develop and refine programs that 
support clinical/translational research training, mentoring, and career development, and build a network of early 
career trainees that specifically supports under-represented groups in the biomedical workforce, (2) create, 
provide, and coordinate accessible resources to aid faculty and trainees in developing, initiating, executing, 
analyzing, and disseminating clinical/translational research and (3) facilitate and enhance Equity, Diversity, and 
Inclusion (EDI) initiatives and training within our multi-institution statewide research community. The PD Core 
will implement the research plan by providing an academic “home”, the Roadmap Scholar Program, a 75% 
protected-time training period over two years that provides clinical and translational research training tailored 
to Scholars with a wider range of research experience (e.g., students to postdoctoral fellows) and from different 
professional disciplines (e.g., medicine, nursing, public health, social work). This cross-institutional structured 
approach has been developed to include collaborating LA CaTS institutions throughout the state of 
Louisiana. The PD Core plans to provide training and research resources, including courses in the 
MSCR curriculum on-site and by Distance Learning, access to a centralized clinical trial enrollment center, the 
state-wide virtual biorepository resource, and “team science” projects focused on health disparities and disease 
outcomes which promote research team collaborations. Distance Learning is key in providing Scholars access 
to all PD Core resources; therefore, a centralized compendium of MSCR courses and research tool kits will be 
provided via an asynchronous system. Overall, the PD Core intends to recruit, educate, and train Scholars from 
various health care disciplines and underrepresented groups (including a new scholar position specifically for 
individuals from underrepresented groups), in clinical and translational research focused on diseases with high 
rates of health disparities to improve health outcomes that negatively affect the citizens of Louisiana."
10884493,"Project Summary: Community Engagement and Outreach Core 
Community Engagement and Outreach (CEO) is a Core of the Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science 
Center (LA CaTS) that facilitates meaningful community involvement in LA CaTS research at all levels. 
Expanded use of community-based participatory research (CBPR) has been noted as a “strategic imperative” to 
develop effective interventions to address health disparities. Community Engagement is an essential component 
of the research process. A review of the history of earlier population-based studies, in both majority and minority 
populations, indicates that requisite to a study's success is the comprehensive involvement of the study 
population's Community. Over the past nine years, CEO has successfully forged and nourished relationships 
with various community members some of whom serve on the three active Community Advisory Boards in New 
Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Shreveport. Additionally, the CEO has provided web-based and in-person training 
to LA CaTS researchers, CAB members, and community organizations on core principles of CBPR, health 
disparities and social determinants of health, and their application to clinical and translational research. With 
community-partnership and -input, LA CaTS investigators increased their success in research funding. 
Additionally, the investigators have been responsive to community-identified health concerns and are aligning 
those concerns with their research focus. To actively foster academic-community collaborative research, CEO 
established and has maintained the LA CaTS Community Scholars Program (LaCoSP). Building on the 
foundation laid for the next funding cycle, the specific aims of the CEO fall into three categories: 1) Expand the 
reach of LA CaTS into Louisiana communities, allowing greater community involvement in setting research 
priorities, identifying health priorities of communities, and creating more opportunities for academic-community- 
Health systems research partnerships in Louisiana; 2) Provide services and resources to LA CaTS investigators 
and community partners to facilitate bi-directional and trusted community engagement and outreach activities, 
community-engaged research, and effective translation of research findings; and 3) Create and maintain 
strategic partnerships between researchers, healthcare practitioners, and lay communities that will promote 
community-engaged translational/clinical research and health promotion leading to mitigation of health 
disparities."
10884494,"Project Summary: Pilot Projects Program Core 
The goal of the Pilot Projects Program (PPP) Core is to increase the number of junior investigators trained in 
clinical and translational research that work with well-established teams of senior scientists developing innovative 
research programs to address the chronic disease burden in Louisiana. This is of particular significance to our 
region given the major health disparities. To achieve this goal, the PPP Core provides direct and significant 
financial support for pilot projects, enables these projects to utilize the expertise and resources of other cores, 
facilitates in-kind support across collaborating institutions, and fosters education and training that enhances each 
awardee's long-term success as an independent translational investigator. While the current funding cycle was 
challenging because of COVID, the PPP funded 36 pilot projects across institutions, including 3 multi- 
institutional, multi-investigator “team science” projects, and prior to COVID, 13 Visiting Scholar and Grant 
Development awards. These initiatives helped build a collaborative spirit among investigators and resulted in 
253 peer reviewed manuscripts by LA CaTS Pilot Project awardees, 117 presentations, and 78 grants awarded 
totaling $69.6 million in the first four years of the current funding cycle. Further, 11 pilot project awardees were 
academically promoted at their home institution. During the next 5-year cycle we will build on these successes 
and expand the number of supported junior investigators where we will prioritize underrepresented minority 
investigators and identify “shovel-ready” highly competitive interinstitutional programs that can rapidly compete 
for major federal grant initiatives. We will also continue to look towards the future by prioritizing early-stage 
investigators and clinicians who can import novel concepts and research techniques to research centers in the 
Gulf South. To achieve these goals, we will implement three specific aims. In the first we will solicit, review, and 
recommend funding for LA CaTS Pilot Project grant awards that are expected to lead to high quality clinical and 
translational research applications for extramural funding. We will prioritize early-stage investigators and junior 
faculty from underrepresented minority populations. Second, we will build inter-institutional teams of investigators 
that are poised to rapidly compete for major federal grant initiatives addressing existing and emerging diseases 
affecting our population and worsening health disparities in the Gulf South. Third, we will provide opportunities 
for early-stage investigators and clinicians to engage in new research training opportunities and learn novel, 
cutting edge methods to conduct, translate and implement innovative research including clinical trials. At the 
conclusion of the next 5-year cycle we expect to have increased the number of funded young investigators, 
including underrepresented minority investigators who can support large multi-institutional research programs 
and centers of excellence and ensure that we can address health care needs and health disparities in our region 
using cutting edge scientific approaches."

significant support to 27 LA CaTS Investigators across 14 institutions, resulting in 46 publications and 18 funded 
grant applications. The BMI Core constructed 12 “virtual cohorts”, which were used in 30 projects leading to 3 
major NCI grant awards. We created the data infrastructure for 3 “virtual biorepositories” and provided the 
informatics backbone for the participation of LA CaTS in the NIH “All of Us” research program and the National 
COVID-19 Cohort Collaboration (N3C). The BMI Core contributed to the LA CaTS response to the COVID-19 
pandemic in multiple ways: 1) Supported 2 multi-CTR N3C projects exploring the relationship of drug exposures 
and rurality with COVID-19 outcomes; 2) Provided the informatics infrastructure for 2 epidemiological studies of 
SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and virus testing; and 3) Supported 3 projects on SARS-CoV-2 variant sequencing 
in Louisiana. The BMI Core also supported the COBRE Center for Translational Viral Oncology and served an 
invaluable role in the close collaboration between LA CaTS and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)- 
led Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences (CCTS), as well as the UAB-led, NIMHD-funded Obesity and 
Health Disparity Research Center. Our commitment to building a diverse pipeline of translational data scientists 
led to a) the first Master of Science program in Bioinformatics in Louisiana, and b) the expansion of Core 
personnel to include 3 early-stage investigators. During the next funding period, the BMI Core will expand its 
mission to include integrative clinical and bioinformatics, machine learning/artificial intelligence, access to 
national and regional clinical databases, individualized mentorship, didactics, as well as community stakeholder 
and citizen scientist support. In cycle 3 we will pursue three important specific aims. Aim 1. Provide training and 
enhance utilization of high-resolution bioinformatics and artificial intelligence/machine learning algorithms. Aim 
2. Expand our existing support for collaboration and data sharing within LA CaTS Cores and between LA CaTS 
investigators and CTSA Centers, as well as with Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) and the 
Louisiana Biomedical Research Network (LBRN) by broadening the geographic scope and population coverage 
of data resources available to LA CaTS investigators. Aim 3. Expand our educational mission, in close 
cooperation with the Professional Development (PD) Core, to create a pipeline of translational data scientists 
with emphasis on diversity and to enable and support data research by citizen scientists and community 
stakeholders. We expect that the accomplishment of these Aims will produce a cutting edge, multidisciplinary 
BMI Core that forms the data science backbone of the LA CaTS Center and enables local, regional, and national 
collaborations, while enhancing our data scientist pipeline and public awareness. The BMI Core will give a vital 
contribution to the Center’s mission to transform clinical and translational research in Louisiana and alleviate 
health disparities."

Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer death, making up nearly 25% of all cancer deaths. Although
some advances in personalized treatments have improved survival rates, there is an ongoing clinical need to
develop novel targeted therapies against LC subtypes with particularly poor prognosis. However, our ability to
develop these treatments is currently limited by a lack of compelling actionable targets. Publicly available
screening data, along with a multitude of prior studies, have validated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2
(NRF2) as a strong and selective dependency in lung cancer. According to patient data, it is estimated that 15%
to 30% of LC tumors have loss of function mutations in either NRF2 or KEAP1, and these mutations are
associated with resistance to conventional treatments and poor prognosis. Furthermore, despite its importance
in sustaining tumor growth, germline NRF2 knockout mouse models produce generally normal mice with no
significant developmental or health-related issues. Combined, these results suggest NRF2 has a wide
therapeutic index and merits further investigation as a potential drug target for LC. Therefore, the proposed
research explores the potential for NRF2 to be a novel therapeutic target in lung cancer by biochemically
characterizing its functional binding partners. To overcome the inherent challenges of targeting NRF2, we used
a high-throughput reporter screen and biochemical assays to identify PRMT5 as a putative modulator of NRF2
activity. We hypothesize that the activity of NRF2 in KEAP1-mutant LC is negatively regulated by a PRMT5-
NRF2 interaction, and that loss of this interaction leads to intolerable levels of NRF2 activity that promote tumor
growth. This hypothesis will be addressed by mapping the biochemical interaction between PRMT and NRF2
(Aim 1), characterizing the PRMT5-mediated repression of NRF2 transcriptional activity (Aim 2), and evaluating
the impact of methylosome perturbations on KEAP1-mutant LC growth (Aim 3). To accomplish the first aim, we
will use reconstituted NRF2 and PRMT5 to carryout advanced biochemical assays designed to identify critical
residues necessary for this interaction. For the second aim, we will employ both nascent RNA-seq and a
combination ChIP-seq analysis to uncover the mechanism of PRMT5-mediated repression of NRF2 activity.
Finally, using available small molecule inhibitors we will assess how disruption of the PRMT5-NRF2 interaction
influences tumor growth in KEAP1-mutant LCs. The information gained from this project will provide a solid
foundation for the advancement of future drug development efforts focused on targeting NRF2."
10900262,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Developmental language disorder (DLD) impacts 7% of all children—both monolingual and bilingual—
and has lifelong consequences for educational attainment and socioemotional wellbeing. DLD is characterized
by deficits in structural language, but the mechanisms underlying these deficits remain under investigation. The
Predictive Processing Hypothesis posits that prediction underlies human cognition and behavior, and it is
increasingly being applied to language. Recent work has applied the Predictive Processing Hypothesis to DLD,
investigating the possibility that deficits in predictive processing underlie language deficits. However, this
hypothesis has only been tested in monolinguals, and only within the context of fluent, idealized language input.
Fillers (e.g., uh and um), are a common disfluency in spontaneous language production and reliably precede
difficult-to-retrieve words (e.g., words that are low-frequency). Neurotypical monolingual adults harness this
association between fillers and production difficulty to anticipate upcoming novelty, but the mechanisms that
underlie children’s comprehension of fillers as signals for upcoming difficult words are poorly understood. This
is particularly so for children who have DLD and/or are exposed to more than one language (bilingual children).
The overarching goal of this proposal is to examine both comprehension of fillers and consequences
for learning in monolingual and bilingual children with and without DLD. A total of 80 children (40 English
monolinguals and 40 Spanish-English bilinguals) ages 4-5, representing the full range of language ability (from
DLD to typical language) will participate. The Specific Aims are: 1.) to determine the impact of disfluencies on
language processing and learning in monolingual children with and without DLD and 2.) to determine the impact
of disfluencies on language processing and learning in bilingual children with and without DLD. Two eye-tracking
visual world tasks, in which children view novel and familiar objects side-by-side, will be used to assess predictive
processing of fillers and word learning under fluent and disfluent conditions. Language ability (from typically
developing to DLD) will be examined continuously under both aims, and bilingualism (proxied by years of second
language exposure) will be examined continuously under Aim 2. Together, the findings across the two aims will
test the innovative Predictive Processing Hypothesis within the novel context of disfluent speech and assess
how consequences of disfluency on processing scale up to impact learning. Moreover, the findings will provide
clinical insight into input characteristics that may enhance or disrupt learning and processing, with implications
for structuring interventions. During the training period, the applicant will acquire new knowledge in the language
profiles of bilingual and monolingual children with DLD as well as methodological considerations for working with
this population; gain critical background knowledge in fluency and disorders; develop expertise in eye-tracking
and advanced statistical analysis; and learn and practice principles of ethical science and effective mentorship."
10900364,"For nearly a century, sleep in the brain has been defined by electrical waves that travel slowly across multiple
centimeters of the isocortex. In stark contrast, the fast neuronal spike-patterns known to encode sensory
information exist in milliseconds of microcircuit activity. My recent pre-print demonstrates that state, too, is
reliably encoded in fast, non-oscillatory spike-patterning within diverse individual microcircuits throughout the
brain. However, despite revealing a novel, fast and local foundation of sleep and wake, my initial study may
underestimate the true minimal scale of the encoding. I hypothesize that the minimal encoding of state in
neural activity is spike patterns, not at the level of the microcircuit, but the individual neuron.
 First, I will verify whether individual neurons encode sleep and wake states in their spike patterns, using
previously conducted microelectrode recordings. Statistical comparisons of spike patterns betweens states will
lay a reproducible foundation in connection with prior literature. My preliminary results reveal that, while
individual neurons encode state in their activity, the general principles require further elucidation.
 Generally, many encodings are structured by the hierarchical organization of the brain, and this may
also be true for sleep/wake encodings. I propose that machine learning can disentangle the general influences
of the animal and region from encodings of state that are unique to each individual neuron. Unique neuron-
level encodings in spike patterning represent a new minimal scale of state, embedding this information on the
scale of neuronal computation.
 Neuron-level states could provide new insight into brain function and, specifically, animal behavior. My
recent pre-print revealed that microcircuit spiking patterns “flicker” between sleep and wake independently of
the animal’s overall state. Further, flickers emerge as a function of sleep pressure and drive behavioral
discontinuities (twitching, pausing). A new, neuron-level state encoding can reveal whether individual neurons
exhibit similar state discontinuities, and whether this explains complex interactions between state and behavior.
 This work has great potential to disentangle brain states on the scale of brain computation (neurons).
Such fundamental knowledge about the basis of sleep and its connection to behavior is highly important to
public health. Biomedically, sleep dysfunction is widely implicated in nearly all neurological disorders- from
epilepsy to autism to Alzheimer’s. Further, localized forms of sleep amidst wake are increasingly observed in
conjunction with attentional disorders and stroke victims.
 These aims facilitate excellent training, particularly in developing novel machine-learning architectures
and performing sophisticated electrophysiological recordings. My highly-supportive co-sponsors are excellent
investigators in computational neuroscience and sleep from renowned institutions. Completion of this proposal
will help prepare me to one day develop my own systems neuroscience research program."
10900193,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Age-related benign enlargement of the prostate gland (BPH) and associated lower urinary tract symptoms
(LUTS) is the most common urologic condition in aging men affecting 70% of men over the age of 60. Despite
initial success of therapies aiming to treat LUTS, these interventions are long -term, expensive, and
discontinuation results in recurrent symptoms. Identifying and incorporating new therapeutic strategies f or
clinical use to effectively treat BPH is necessary. Recent data from our lab and others has implicated stem cell
transcription factor SOX2 in prostate regeneration pathways that play a role in prostate enlargement during
BPH. SOX2 is highly expressed in BPH tissue and a lineage tracing experiment showed a SOX2-positive cell
population survives prostate involution and can derive SOX2-negative luminal epithelial cells during prostate
regeneration. Despite this evidence that SOX2 contributes to prostate gro wth/regeneration, pharmacologically
targeting SOX2 expression in this context has not been explored. Data from a recent drug screening
experiment, single cell RNA-seq, and mining of meta-data implicate IGF1R signaling as an upstream regulator
of SOX2 transcription. Unpublished data shows a reduction of SOX2 transcript and protein after IGF1R
inhibition. Based on these unpublished results, we hypothesize that SOX2 is necessary for prostate
regeneration and that decreasing SOX2 expression through inhibition of IGF1R will prevent prostate
regeneration and improve current therapeutics for BPH.
The overall objectives for this proposal will address this hypothesis experimentally utilizing new model systems
and technology and provide training and professional development support to advance the candidate’s career
as an independent investigator. Addressing the hypothesis will utilize the following specific aims: 1) determine
the impact of SOX2 in prostate epithelial cell survival and prostate enlargement and lower urinary tract
dysfunctions of symptomatic BPH, and 2) delineate the mechanism for the reduction of SOX2 expression after
IGF1R inhibition. To accomplish the first aim, prostate epithelial cell survival will quantified in vitro after IGF1R
inhibition. To assess clinical relevance, a mouse model for symptomatic BPH will be utilized to assess prostate
enlargement and voiding symptoms following IGF1R inhibition. To achieve the second aim, a proteome
profiler, Western blotting, and siRNA will be utilized to interrogate the mechanism mediating the IGF1R/SOX2
regulatory pathway. To accomplish the proposed career development objectives, the candidate will 1) establish
unique research position by developing technical skills in BPH-LUTS model systems and drug design and
development, 2) cultivate skills necessary to facilitate a career as an independent researcher including formal
training in mentorship and grant writing, and 3) strengthen research communication skills and network in the
field of benign urology. This proposal will provide the resources and training necessary to assess the role of
SOX2 in prostatic disease as a career development project."

 Commensal microbes are indispensable for healthy physiology of their eukaryotic hosts and provide
essential functions required for host survival, including nutrition and colonization resistance, and perform
accessory functions, including immune system development, vascularization, and contribute to behavior.
Composition of the microbiome is shaped by many factors. Some influences are acute, such as diet and
infection, which rapidly change the commensal population, but it returns to its pre-challenge composition. On
the other hand, the genetics of the host have a constant influence on the microbial composition. While
increasing pieces of evidence point to host genetics playing a critical role in shaping the microbiome, how it
does so is adversely understudied. To eliminate the influence of environmental factors and study only the role
of host genetics in shaping the microbiome, a murine model of legacy-independent host-commensal
interactions was developed. This model provided the foundational blueprint establishing that the microbiome is
impacted by host mechanisms, but how they are impacted has to be investigated.
 Herein, we describe how we developing this model to dissect the role of host genetics in specific host-
commensal interactions. We have identified that the population of Lactobacillus murinus, a prominent member
of the gut microbiome, is directly shaped by host genetics. Through an interdisciplinary approach spanning
immunology, microbiology, and genetics, we will determine the mechanism directly influencing the intestinal
population of Lactobacilli. The proposed experiments will provide an experimental platform by which any host-
commensal relationship driven by host genetics can be identified and the mechanism can be determined.
 Drs. Golovkina and Chervonsky are ideal sponsor and co-sponsor, respectively, for this project. Not
only did they establish the legacy-independent host-commensal model, but they are also experts in the fields of
microbiology, immunology, and genetics. Dr. Golovkina is a mouse geneticist who has built her career on using
inbred mouse strains to identify genes driving phenotypic differences in host-pathogen interactions and co-
established the field of microbiome-virus pathogen interactions. Dr. Chervonsky is a renowned immunologist
and expert in host-commensal interactions and the influence of the microbiome on autoimmunity. He is also
the co-director of the Gnotobiotic Component of the Host-Microbe Core at the University of Chicago. Their
laboratories are uniquely situated to support my efforts to study the gnotobiotic models necessary to delineate
host-commensal interactions through rigorous genetic studies.
 They are dedicated mentors to my academic, scientific career at the bench and beyond. All necessary
resources to conduct the proposed experiments are found either in the labs already or on campus at the
University of Chicago. In addition to having many resources available for scientific use, the University of
Chicago is a fantastic training center for postdoctoral trainees."
10903957,"Bacteria have evolved specialized nanomachines functioning as secretion systems to deliver proteins or DNA
from the bacterial cytoplasm to the surrounding milieu or into other eukaryotic or bacterial target cells. To
date, nine different types of bacterial secretion systems have been identified. The most widely-distributed and
versatile of these, the type IV secretion systems (T4SSs), traverse the cell envelopes of many Gram-negative
and -positive species. Members of one large subfamily, the DNA transfer or conjugation systems, are
medically problematic because they deliver mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and their cargoes of antibiotic
resistance genes and virulence determinants among bacterial populations; these systems also elaborate
conjugative pili or other surface adhesins that promote establishment of robust, antibiotic-resistant biofilm
communities. A second T4SS subfamily, the ‘effector translocators’ are deployed by many medically-
important pathogens to deliver protein effectors across the cell envelope either to the surrounding milieu or
into eukaryotic host cells to incite infection. By use of in situ cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET), I have
recently solved the structures of three different T4SSs, the Legionella pneumophila Dot/Icm, Escherichia coli
F plasmid Tra, and Helicobacter pylori Cag systems within their natural cell envelopes. These new structures
are changing existing paradigms for how T4SSs are architecturally configured, they present the first clear
views of central substrate translocation channels, and they identify novel F-encoded structures configured as
basal platforms for F pili. Type IX secretion systems (T9SSs), which are found mainly in the phylum
Bacteroidetes, also play critical roles in infection. Porphyromonas gingivalis, for example, deploys its T9SS to
secrete gingipain proteinases and virulence factors to incite periodontal disease. Very recently, I solved the
structure of this T9SS in its natural cellular context by in situ Cryo-ET. This large (~50 nm diameter),
envelope-spanning nanomachine differs markedly from any other bacterial secretion systems visualized to
date. In this MIRA proposal, I seek to comprehensively define the structures and subunit compositions of the
F plasmid Tra and H. pylori Cag T4SSs and the P. gingivalis T9SS by addressing key unresolved questions
that are ideally or uniquely approachable using in situ Cryo-ET. We will i) solve in situ structures with
emphasis on regions of these nanomachines such as the inner membrane complexes, translocation channels,
and machine - pilus junctions that have not been amenable to structural analyses using in vitro approaches, ii)
leverage our resources through collaborations with experts in the T4SS and T9SS fields to place our
structural findings in broader mechanistic and biological contexts, and iii) refine methods for data collection
and processing to improve the resolution limits of in situ Cryo-ET. Our studies will generate important new
insights into the architectures, biogenesis, and mechanisms of action of bacterial secretion nanomachines,
and set the stage for design of intervention therapies."

 Lithium is a first-line therapy for millions of people suffering from bipolar disorder, and is promising for
inhibiting development of dementia. Experiments show that a primary mode by which Li+ alters physiological
processes is by reducing activities of a surprisingly limited number of Mg2+-dependent phosphoryl-transferring
enzymes, including phosphomonoesterases and protein kinases. While the (Li-independent) catalytic
mechanisms of these enzymes are quite well-understood, much about the mechanistic details underlying their
Li-susceptibility remain unknown. Not surprisingly, it remains a major challenge to design enzyme variants that
are Li-resistant, and use them to disentangle signaling pathways associated with Li-susceptibilities of individual
enzymes. Here we focus on Li+'s action on kinases, and address the following problem central to alleviating the
issues raised above. Experiments on 71 human kinases show a wide range of Li-susceptibility — many are
unaffected and others are affected to varying degrees. But there is no explanation for these variations.
 We address this gap in our understanding of Li-action by using state-of-the-art molecular mechanics
(MM), quantum mechanics (QM) and QM/MM simulations, as well as mutagenesis experiments guided by
bioinformatics and natural selection. Supported by experiments, we explore the overarching hypothesis that Li+
affects kinase activity by interacting directly with their catalytic sites. In Aim 1, simulations will examine how Li+
binds kinases, and how Li+ binding reduces kinase activity. Additionally, simulations will provide insights into
potential allosteric effects that regulate catalytic site activity. Our biochemical, cellular and in vivo experiments
in Aim2 are designed to (i) systematically examine effects of sequence differences between Li-sensitive and Li-
resistant kinases, with the goal of making a Li-sensitive enzyme, GSK-3, resistant to Li+; and (ii) discover key
residues that make certain kinases Li-sensitive. Experiments will also validate findings from simulations, and at
the same time, simulations will provide molecular insights to interpret results from mutational experiments.
 Combined analysis of results from simulations and experiments will yield a Li-resistant GSK-3, which is
significant because it will, for the first time, enable us to disentangle GSK-3-driven physiological effects of Li+
from those of other Li-sensitive enzymes. This study will also provide a physical basis to explain observed
variations of Li-sensitivity across kinases, and these biophysical findings will serve as foundations for future
efforts to make other Li-sensitive kinases resistant to Li+, and map their specific phenotypes. We expect that
such efforts will improve understanding and predictions of patient responses to Li-treatments and dosages,
which remains a difficult task. This will both expedite therapy and avoid exposure to side effects. Finally, this
study will explore new advancements in modeling enzyme reactions and yield a validated polarizable force
field for describing Li+/Mg2+ interactions with proteins. This will enable future reliable studies of Li-action on
proteins not considered in this project and broaden exploration of the full range of Mg-binding proteins."
10903959,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Diploid germ cells are transformed into haploid gametes via the reductive division of meiosis. After meiotic
DNA synthesis, germ cells enter meiotic prophase I, which distinguishes itself from mitotic prophase by two
major characteristics. First, meiotic prophase I is dramatically longer than mitotic prophase. Second, meiotic
prophase I involves an intricate series of chromosomal events that contribute to the establishment of the
haploid state. The extended length of prophase I is critical for the completion of these chromosomal events, as
premature exit from prophase I causes recombination defects and chromosome mis-segregation. In mammals,
meiotic prophase I is prolonged by Meioc and Ythdc2. In the absence of either gene in both males and females,
meiotic germ cells fail to complete meiotic prophase I and prematurely enter an abnormal metaphase before
ultimately apoptosing. Several preliminary observations suggest that MEIOC and YTHDC2 function as a
complex to post-transcriptionally regulate cell cycle factors within meiotic germ cells. MEIOC and YTHDC2 are
first expressed in the germ line at meiotic initiation, and they interact with one another as well as with an
overlapping set of transcripts, including key cell cycle regulators. These targets are enriched for the RNA
modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A), which is preferentially recognized by YTHDC2's YTH domain and
which is used to target and post-transcriptionally regulate RNA. In the absence of Meioc, MEIOC and
YTHDC2's targets exhibit reduced stability. Changes in transcript stability are oftentimes accompanied by
changes in translation, and in HeLa cells, YTHDC2 enhances translational efficiency while decreasing mRNA
abundance. However, it remains unknown whether MEIOC and YTHDC2 affect translation in meiotic germ
cells. This proposal will test the hypothesis that MEIOC and YTHDC2 function as a complex to recognize and
translationally regulate m6A-modified mRNA in order to establish a meiosis-specific cell cycle program. This
hypothesis will be tested via three specific aims. The first aim will assess MEIOC's ability to affect YTHDC2's
interactions with RNA, particularly cell cycle-related transcripts, by identifying the transcripts that YTHDC2
binds to in the presence and absence of Meioc. In addition, whether m6A contributes to MEIOC and YTHDC2's
ability to interact with RNA will also be assessed. The second aim will identify the translational changes that
occur as germ cells transition from mitosis to meiosis, as well as between wild-type and Meioc-null samples. In
particular, this aim will determine whether cell cycle factors are translationally repressed at the onset of meiosis
and by the upregulation of Meioc. The third aim will determine whether MEIOC and YTHDC2 are continuously
required during meiotic prophase I to prevent precocious cell cycle progression, as well as identify the
mechanistic regulation behind this putative requirement. Collectively, these fundamental studies on MEIOC
and YTHDC2's regulation of the length of meiotic prophase I will provide key insights into the establishment
and regulation of the meiotic cell cycle program, with broader implications for fertility, development, and cancer."

 For 29 years, the annual Boston Bacterial Meeting (BBM) has brought together researchers involved in all
areas of bacteriology research, attracting attendees from both within and outside New England. In congruence
with its goal of cultivating the scientific and professional growth of young scientists, this long-standing meeting
is organized by student and postdoctoral fellow volunteers, with faculty and administrative support. BBM is a
two-day meeting featuring short oral presentations, multiple poster sessions, breakout sessions, evening
receptions, and a keynote lecture by a leading senior investigator. The participants typically hail from over 100
academic and biotechnology institutions and span both the breadth and depth of bacteriology research in the
New England area and increasingly beyond. Many participants attend BBM every year, recognizing it as a
unique, intellectually stimulating, and innovative conference.
 BBM aims to (1) offer opportunities for young investigators to present their research, (2) provide a forum
for scientists to learn about and discuss new bacteriology research, and (3) foster collaboration and encourage
participants to build professional relationships. All research presentations at BBM are given by students,
postdoctoral fellows, and junior industry scientists. Thus, BBM promotes the careers of young scientists by
providing trainees and junior scientists a chance to hone their presentation skills and network with colleagues,
potential future advisors, and/or employers. Participants at BBM have expertise in disparate research fields
within basic systems, environmental, industrial, computational, and medical bacteriology, and presentations at
BBM reflect this scientific diversity. Unlike more topically focused conferences, BBM allows participants to hear
about and discuss a wide variety of discoveries and methods that may be unfamiliar but which all relate to the
common theme of increasing our understanding of bacteria. This feature, along with the geographical proximity
of most participants of BBM, enables the transfer of ideas, technology, and new discoveries between these
groups. To facilitate collaboration and building professional relationships, BBM includes multiple sessions for
free discussion as well as several opportunities for structured networking.
 BBM will achieve its aims by continuing to cultivate a vibrant community of New England bacteriologists.
The meeting presents a broad range of topics and a format that encourages interaction among participants. For
many young researchers for whom attendance at major international meetings may not be financially feasible,
BBM is a vital opportunity to practice scientific communication and to be exposed to the rich bacteriological
research community that the conference draws upon. The emphasis on communication and interaction within
the broad scope of bacteriology is a major strength of the meeting. Overall, BBM has and continues to advance
research in basic, applied, and clinical microbiology, and furthers the professional development of attendees."

Antibodies are an important class of therapeutics that are widely used for treatment of cancer, autoimmune
diseases, and infectious diseases. Compelling experimental data have demonstrated that Fc glycosylation is a
critical structural determinant for modulating antibody’s effector functions, including antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), activation of apoptosis, and anti-
inflammatory activities. However, progress in understanding the functional roles of antibody glycosylation is
hampered by the tremendous structural heterogeneity of Fc glycosylation. To address this problem, we have
developed a chemoenzymatic method that permits site-specific Fc and Fab glycan remodeling to generate
homogeneous antibody glycoforms. In ths application, we propose to exploit the site-specific chemoenzymatic
glycan remodeling method as a key platform technology to address three important questions related to
antibody functions, as highlighted in the following three specific aims. Aim 1 is to understand how Fc
glycosylation modulate Fc receptor binding and ADCC activity by selective modification of the core fucose, by
performing structural studies, and by synthesizing novel glycoforms, coupled with Fc receptor binding and
ADCC assays. Aim 2 is to evaluate how site-specific sialylation of Fc glycans affects antibody’s anti-
inflammatory activity by constructing asymmetrically sialylated or multiply sialylated glycoforms, coupled with
animal studies. Aim 3 is to augment antibody’s complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) by constructing
structurally well-defined Gal/rhamnose antigen-antibody conjugates to recruit natural IgG and IgM antibodies
in circulation. These studies will yield important new knowledge in glyco-immunology, which will facilitate the
development of more effective antibody-based therapeutics."
10900582,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
In nature, bacteria primarily exist in biofilms – dense surface-attached communities of cells embedded in an
extracellular matrix. Many advantages accrue to the bacteria living in biofilms, including adhesion to surfaces,
resistance to antibiotics and predation, and collective processing of nutrient sources. From a human perspective,
biofilms can be beneficial, e.g. in the context of the microbiome and bioremediation. However, biofilms can also
be problematic, e.g. biofilms cause major problems in medicine as they lead to chronic infections, and in industry
biofilms foul surfaces and clog filtration devices. How biofilms assemble and disassemble depends on the
particular bacterial species, but there exist broadly general principles. To pursue investigations of overarching
principles, here we ask the fundamental question: how are biofilms able to achieve coherent population-level
outcomes, such as synchronous disassembly and dispersal, despite large stochastic variation (“noise”) in single-
cell gene expression? In a breakthrough enabled by light-sheet microscopy, we have recently tracked the
individual cells in living, growing biofilms of the model pathogen Vibrio cholerae, from a single founder cell up to
10,000 cells. Therefore, we are now in a position to couple light-sheet imaging with our existing fluorescent
reporters of single-cell gene expression to measure noise at the individual-cell level within living V. cholerae
biofilms. These new data will empower us to address our fundamental question, with a focus on these key facets:
(1) How much information do individual cells possess about their spatiotemporal location within a biofilm? (2)
How do biofilm cells integrate multiple time-dependent sensory inputs to decide whether and when to disperse,
and is this decision made collectively or at the single-cell level? Answering these questions will require a close,
iterative merger of experiments with biophysical modeling. Particular modeling innovations will be information-
theoretic studies of single biofilms cells transitioning from low to high cell density, pathway-based analysis of the
integration of quorum-sensing and nutrient-derived signals, agent-based mechanical simulation of dispersal from
a biofilm, and development of a continuum model for the entire dispersal process. Our studies of the emergence
of precise collective behaviors from noisy single cells in this tractable model system will provide a paradigm for
similar analyses across bacterial species, and for coherent multicellular processes more generally."
10900788,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The extent to which SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy affects the biology of the maternal-placental-fetal triad
and neurodevelopmental trajectory in offspring is not known. Early studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can induce
alterations in the placenta which can increase risk for adverse perinatal outcomes and, based on knowledge
from other infectious and inflammatory disorders in pregnancy and preliminary data on the current pandemic,
increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in offspring. The long-term goal of this proposal is to
timely identify the impact of the ongoing pandemic on the neurodevelopment of infants born following maternal
SARS-CoV-2 infection. The objective is to analyze the relationships between maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection,
placenta biology, and neurodevelopmental outcomes, in interaction with genomic risk (GRSs) for NDDs and sex.
The central hypothesis is that maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection and infection-related pregnancy complications
affect early paths of brain development, particularly in those with high GRSs for NDDs and in males, and that
these effects are mediated by alterations in placenta morphology and molecular biology. The rationale underlying
the proposal is that completion will define critical targets for identification and potentially prevention of NDDs in
the offspring of infected mothers. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims:
1) Determine pregnancy, placental, and newborn outcomes following antenatal SARS-CoV-2 infection; 2)
Investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 maternal infection, GRSs for NDDs, and placenta molecular
biology; 3) Evaluate the relationship between maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, offspring genomic
risk factors for NDDs, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. We will pursue the aims using an innovative
combination of placenta tissue and maternal and fetal blood analysis, and comprehensive psychometric testing
of early child neurodevelopment. We will compare woman-placenta-infant triads exposed to SARS-CoV-2
infection during pregnancy to unvaccinated and vaccinated controls. We will study how, in a large sample of
multiple ethnicities, maternal infection and stress, GRSs for NDDs, and sex, adversely affect
neurodevelopmental outcomes of the offspring though processes mediated by alteration in placenta gene/protein
expression and maternal immune activation. The proposed research is significant, because it will characterize
the relationship between maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection and neurodevelopmental outcome of the offspring, and
also identify factors, molecules and genomic predictors that modulate, mediate or – as biomarkers – reveal such
relationship. The proximate expected outcome of this work will be an understanding of the mechanisms through
which maternal infection, genomic risk and sex, placenta biology, and postnatal factors may contribute to define
risk for NDDs. The results will have an immediate positive impact to inform targeted interventions and guidelines
for SARS-CoV-2 exposed women and their infants, impacting how clinicians evaluate and care for these cases,

pressures and right heart failure. A hallmark of PAH pathology is progressive loss and inappropriate regeneration
of pulmonary and right ventricular (RV) microvessels. Pericytes are highly specialized mural cells that interact
with endothelial cells to provide structural support and facilitate vessel maturation during angiogenesis. Our
studies show that inability to establish proper endothelial-pericyte (EC-PC) interactions is associated with
pulmonary small vessel loss and insufficient angiogenesis in PAH, leading us to speculate that targeting the
mechanisms that orchestrate EC-PC interactions could open new therapeutic opportunities for PAH. We have
demonstrated that dysfunctional Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling contributes to small vessel loss in PAH
by disrupting lung EC-PC interactions. We found that pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs)
release Wnt5a to recruit lung pericytes via ROR2-dependent Wnt/PCP activation in pericytes. Compared to
healthy donors, both Wnt5a production and ROR2-dependent Wnt/PCP activation are significantly reduced in
PAH PMVECs and pericytes, respectively. We also found that endothelial-specific Wnt5a deletion in mice was
associated with decompensated RV failure characterized by disrupted EC-PC interactions and reduced RV
capillary density. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that loss of Wnt/PCP signaling contributes to lung
and RV vessel dysfunction in PAH by disrupting the establishment of EC-PC interactions and
angiogenesis. In this renewal, we plan to: (Aim 1) Elucidate the mechanisms responsible for inappropriate
Wnt5a expression by PAH PMVECs, (Aim 2) Elucidate the mechanisms responsible for dysfunctional ROR2
activity in PAH pericytes, and (Aim 3) Demonstrate that Wnt5a/ROR2 signaling plays a key role in RV remodeling
and angiogenesis in response to PAH. Understanding how Wnt/PCP orchestrates endothelial-pericyte
interactions will provide insight into the PAH pathogenesis and open new therapeutic opportunities to promote
regeneration of lost vessels, prevent progression and improve clinical outcomes for patients afflicted with this
devastating disease."

The contribution of tissue-resident immune cells to the production of inflammatory senescence associated
secretory phenotype factors and the impact on the tissue environment is unknown, precluding the understanding
of immune senescence in aging and disease in tissue and organ specific context. In this project, a diverse group
of experts in aging biology, immunobiology, bioengineering, cell biology, and computational biology propose a
Yale murine Tissue Mapping Center for immune cell senescence (Yale-mTMC) through investigation of well-
defined lineage-marked mouse models by unbiased single-cell resolution OMICS approaches aims to discover
the cellular lineage of SASP producing cells and novel biomarkers that define stromal and immune-cell
senescence in vivo. The Biological Analysis Core (BAC) of Yale-mTMC will create the cellular senescence-
associated tissue atlases of thymus, bone marrow, spleen, PBMCs and mesenteric adipose tissue. In order to
detect and characterize rare senescent cells in vivo, construct the biomolecular and cellular map of senescent
cells in these tissues implicated in immune senescence, and dissect their impact on the tissue environment, the
BAC will deploy and combine three categories of bioanalytical pipelines including (i) 2D and 3D Multiplexed
Imaging (MI), (ii) Single Cell Analysis (SCA) of transcriptome and proteins, and (iii) Spatial Multi-Omics
Sequencing (SMOS), in order to achieve the sensitivity to detect rare senescent cells, the depth to characterize
the heterogeneity of senescent cells at the genome scale, and the breathe to map a wide range of cells in situ
to construct the maps of senescent cells and the associated tissue microenvironments. Specifically, the BAC will
pursue the following aims: (1) to provide biospecimens for analyses from lineage-marked mice with multiple
biological controls and authentication of senescence-models through co-operation with murine Tissue Mapping
Centers. (2) Implement an array of characterization pipelines for single-cell and spatial omics mapping of immune
cell senescence and the tissue environment, and (3) to scale and standard these pipelines by increasing the
assay speed and throughput in multiplex imaging and spatial multi-omics sequencing and by developing a fully
integrated and standardized workflow. Yale-mTMC's BAC brings several novel animal models and unique tissue
specimens that will be shared within SenNet as well as novel spatial multi-omics techniques that will enhance
the analytical capability of the consortium. It will generate a multi-omics molecular and cell atlas of senescent
immune cells in multiple lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs and collaborate with human SenNet teams to map
and identify common senescent signatures across tissue and species."

10873485,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pediatric chronic pain is a critical public health problem, affecting up to a third of adolescents and contributing
to significant emotional distress, poor sleep, and difficulties in social functioning. These difficulties include
social isolation, friendship instability, and high rates of peer victimization both on and offline. Whether peer
relationship problems are a cause, correlate, or consequence of chronic pain is largely unknown. Although
research has long demonstrated links between social pain (e.g., social exclusion, loneliness) and physical
pain—little research has examined the prospective, daily, or chronic impact of peer relationship problems on
pain persistence and pain-related disability in childhood. Further, no research has examined how positive peer
relationship factors (e.g., social connectedness, social support) may promote recovery or protect against the
development of disabling pediatric chronic pain. The objective of the proposed research is to identify specific
peer relationship processes that influence pain persistence, exacerbation, and recovery in a cohort of 450 early
adolescents (ages 11-14) at risk for developing chronic pain (i.e., youth seeking treatment for an acute pain
problem). Longitudinal studies that model the trajectories of peer relationship processes are needed to
establish temporal relationships and disentangle social risk and protective factors from outcomes. If peer
relationship factors contribute to pain persistence and pain-related disability, improving these relationships
should become an immediate goal of both prevention and intervention efforts. Here we combine 1) a large-
scale longitudinal cohort design, 2) comprehensive assessment of peer relationship processes and pain, and
3) a model-based approach to determine whether and how specific peer relationship processes (e.g., social
exclusion, cyber-victimization, social connectedness) contribute to pain outcomes in at-risk youth during the
critical transition from early to middle adolescence (Aims 1 and 2). Electronic daily diary monitoring of peer
victimization experiences and pain, incorporating objective assessment of social media use and sleep, will be
combined with qualitative interview data to characterize the temporal dynamics between peer victimization,
social media use, shared comorbidities, (i.e., poor sleep, low mood) and pain outcomes (Aim 3). Our broad
hypothesis is that peer relationship problems will contribute to pain persistence and disability, directly and
indirectly (through mood and sleep mechanisms)—and that these effects will be mitigated by the presence of
strong social support and social connectedness. The proposed methodologically rigorous mixed-methods
investigation of peer relationship trajectories from early to middle adolescence will advance our understanding
of the specific peer relationship processes that contribute to pain risk and resilience in childhood. Mechanistic
insights regarding the role of modifiable social contextual factors will influence clinical practice guidelines and
the development of preventative interventions designed to reduce risk of high impact chronic pain in childhood
and beyond."
10872580,"Project Summary
As a brain-wide neuromodulator, serotonin regulates a vast array of cognitive and emotional
functions. It can potently induce plasticity in the adult brain. And with this power, it can promote
learning and open windows for change and healing in neuropsychiatric conditions. It also has
important roles in adaptive behavioral responses to stress, affiliative social behavior, aggression, and
sleep. It is no wonder that serotonergic agents are widely used in psychiatry across several
diagnoses. However, current treatments have many limitations. Most affect the serotonin system
globally without regard to its underlying heterogeneity. To modulate the system in a targeted way, we
need to understand how it is wired, and what each wire does. Serotonergic neurons in the dorsal and
medial raphe nuclei send axonal projections throughout the entire brain. In this project, we will map
these projections, with single cell resolution barcoding approach, to all their major brain targets. We
will determine the strength of the projection to each target, and we will determine which target areas
are coregulated by collateral projections, forming subnetworks. Furthermore, we will determine the
molecular and functional identity of the neurons in each projection. Identifying the anatomical,
molecular, and functional brain-wide serotonergic subnetworks could lead to new approaches for
targeted therapies."

10874476,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Women are disproportionately affected by Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias
(AD/ADRD) relative to men. Prior research focuses overwhelmingly on sex-related biological explanations for
this disparity, but the consequences of gender-related social and behavioral factors may also be considerable.
The proposed research will make progress towards understanding these consequences through two Aims. Both
Aims leverage data from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative panel survey of older U.S.
adults that includes information on respondents’ cognitive state as well as demographic, social and economic,
and health-related characteristics. Aim 1 is to characterize the contributions of education to trends in AD/ADRD
by sex/gender. Analyses will first document sex/gender-specific trends in AD/ADRD prevalence from 2000 to
2016. Variance decomposition will then be used to quantify how much of the observed changes in prevalence
were due to changes in levels of education and to changes in effects of education on AD/ADRD. Aim 2 is to
examine how education combines with work and occupation to produce patterns of AD/ADRD by sex/gender.
First, patterns of workforce participation and occupational characteristics by sex/gender and education will be
described. Path analysis will then be used to evaluate whether and how workforce participation and occupational
characteristics mediate relationships between education and AD/ADRD for women and men.
The proposed research builds on Dr. Zacher’s prior quantitative training and research on education, sex/gender,
and health. It will also require Dr. Zacher to build additional expertise in aging, AD/ADRD, and demographic
methods. Towards this end, Dr. Zacher will undertake extensive training during the K01 award period with the
guidance of an impressive mentoring team led by Dr. Susan Short, Professor of Sociology and Director of the
Population Studies and Training Center at Brown University. Co-mentors include Drs. Eileen Crimmins, AARP
Professor of Gerontology, USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology; David Dosa, Associate Professor of
Medicine and Health Services, Policy and Practice, Brown University; Richard Jones, Professor of Neurology
and Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University; and Vincent Mor,
Florence Pirce Grant University Professor and Professor of Health Services, Policy and Practice, Brown
University. Dr. Zacher’s training will support her short-term goal of completing the proposed K01 research
successfully while also preparing her for her long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator and
expert on the demography of aging and AD/ADRD, with a special focus on sex/gender and education."
10874616,"MISMATCH REPAIR AND CARCINOGENESIS
PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Defects in human mismatch repair (MMR) are the cause of Lynch syndrome aka hereditary non-polyposis
colorectal cancer (LS/HNPCC), as well as 10-40% of various sporadic cancers. MMR corrects DNA polymerase
misincorporation errors, suppresses recombination between non-allelic partially homologous DNA sequences,
and functions as a lesion sensor in DNA damage signaling. The unrepaired errors in MMR-deficient cells lead
to increased genomic mutations that drives tumorigenesis, while the lack of damage sensing results in resistance
to several common chemotherapeutics. Conversely, MMR defective tumors appear to activate cellular innate
immunity that results in strikingly effective PD1/PD-L1-based immunotherapy. Despite decades of study, critical
aspects of MMR mechanics remain uncertain, the sequence of events that leads to MMR damage signaling is
poorly understood, and the mechanism that connects MMR to innate immunity is largely a mystery.
Four MMR genes account for most of the LS/HNPCC mutations and include the highly conserved MutS homologs
(MSH) and MutL homologs (MLH/PMS) MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2. During the last funding period, we
expanded our single molecule imaging capabilities and discovered that the MSH and MLH/PMS proteins interact
to form novel cascading sliding clamps on a mismatched DNA. Once loaded by an MSH, the MLH/PMS sliding
clamps assist in detecting the error-containing strand and function as a processivity factor for MMR excision
activities, while retaining a large enough “donut hole” to transit nucleosomes. The remarkable stability and DNA
diffusion properties of the MSH and MLH/PMS sliding clamps clarified our understanding of MMR mechanisms,
while provoking new concepts for strand-specific excision and damage signaling. Remarkably, the MSH and
MLH/PMS sliding clamps displayed entirely random motions when on the DNA. Deterministic mechanisms have
historically underpinned MMR models, where static complexes and well-defined stepwise biochemical
sequences are proposed to complete repair events. This renewal application will explore the hypothesis that the
entire multi-component multi-pathway MMR process is Stochastic: governed by chance encounters, varied
repair intermediates and/or MMR component exchanges that are orchestrated and anchored to the DNA by
dynamic MSH and MLH/PMS sliding clamps. Understanding the depth of biochemical randomness during MMR
will facilitate similar biophysical studies of more complex DNA repair systems.
We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) examine the interactions and competition between human MMR
components in real-time, 2) detail the dynamic selection and interchange between strand-specific excision
components during MMR, 3) examine fundamental damage recognition and signaling interactions on chromatin
substrates, and 4) visualize human MMR component interactions with single molecule resolution in vivo. The
overall goal of this research is to detail the MMR mechanisms that lead to faithful repair as well as how MMR
defects instigate the genome instability that drives cancer, drug resistance and immune activation."
10874624,"Enteric pathogen infections cause an immense disease burden among children in low-resource settings.
Understanding pathogen-specific transmission in high burden populations, and whether transmission is reduced
through environmental intervention (reduced exposure) or improved nutrition (reduced susceptibility) is crucially
important for informing global public health programs. In preliminary studies, our team has developed multiplex
bead assays that measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) response to diverse enteric pathogens, along with
seroepidemiologic methods to measure changes in transmission based on enteric pathogen antibody response.
Antibody-based measures should complement stool-based PCR measures of infection in studies with infrequent
measurement (rather than continuous monitoring) because antibody response integrates exposure over time,
thus providing additional information about infections that begin and resolve between measurements.
 Our overall objective is to use seroepidemiologic methods to measure intervention effects on enteric
pathogen transmission, and to leverage large-scale trials to develop new methods that combine multiplex testing
with spatial epidemiology to locate communities with highest multi-pathogen burdens. Our team recently
completed cluster randomized trials in Kenya and Bangladesh that delivered water, sanitation, handwashing
(WASH), and nutritional interventions to pregnant mothers, and measured primary endpoints (growth, diarrhea)
among their newborn children through age 24 months. Each trial enrolled and randomized >700 communities.
Blood samples were collected among longitudinal substudies of ≈1,500 children in each country at ages 6, 12,
and 24 months across factorial arms (Control, WSH, Nutrition, Nutrition + WSH), and among ~4,000 children per
country at age 24 months. We propose to test for IgG responses using a multiplex bead assay that includes
antigens to nine enteric pathogens: Giardia sp., Cryptosporidium sp., Entamoeba histolytica, Strongyloides sp.,
Ascaris sp., Campylobacter sp., enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., and norovirus.
 In Aim 1, we will use the factorial trial design to measure the effects of WASH and nutrition interventions on
antibody-based measures of enteric pathogen transmission in each country, including mean IgG response,
seroprevalence, and force of infection. We hypothesize that the interventions reduced transmission of enteric
pathogens through reduced exposure (WASH) and reduced susceptibility to infection (nutrition). In Aim 2, we
will combine multiplex antibody data with spatial models to map landscapes of enteric pathogen exposure and
develop generalizable methods to identify communities with highest, multi-pathogen burdens. We hypothesize
that antibody-based measures will align with other measures of infection, and that there will be geographic
overlap in hotspots, identifying communities with the highest multi-pathogen burdens. Richly characterized trials
in two countries ensure results will be rigorous and policy relevant. Completion of these aims will significantly
advance the use of serological assays in enteric pathogen intervention studies and population surveillance."
10874625,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Three-dimensional ultrasound imaging (3D-US) is an essential clinical tool for visualizing, navigating, and
investigating patient anatomy and pathologies in real time in 3D. Owing to its moderate cost and lack of ionizing
radiation, 3D-US plays an important role in many clinical applications for diagnosis and intervention. Despite the
significant clinical value and potential, 3D-US is not a widely accessible and capable technology with its current
implementations: existing 3D-US solutions are challenged by many limitations such as low imaging speed, low
functionality, bulky devices that are inconvenient to use, and a high cost of designated equipment. For decades,
there has been a long-standing quest for developing an accessible, functional, and user-friendly 3D-US
technology. In this proposal, we will develop a new 3D-US solution (called FASTER) that uses a novel, fast-tilting
microfabricated acoustic reflector to achieve high-speed and high-functionality 3D-US imaging. The acoustic
reflector is water-immersible and enclosed in a clip-on device that is compact, lightweight, and low-cost. It can
be easily attached to and removed from different types of ultrasound transducers to turn a conventional 2D
ultrasound system into 3D. Unlike conventional 3D-US technologies (e.g., wobbler transducers and 2D matrix
arrays), FASTER does not require the procurement of additional ultrasound transducers for different applications.
Also, FASTER achieves a much higher imaging volume rate (up to 1000 Hz) than conventional 3D-US
technologies. FASTER is compatible with most ultrasound systems on the market ranging from premium
scanners to portable and handheld devices. In this proposal, we will conduct basic technology development
research and carry out preliminary clinical studies to build a solid technical foundation for the FASTER 3D-US
technology. In Aim 1 we will focus on developing the Phase-1 FASTER device that uses a double-axis reflector
for extended range of imaging volume rate and field-of-view (FOV). We will also develop Phase-1 FASTER into
a stand-alone device that does not need external equipment and communicates wirelessly with the ultrasound
system. Aim 2 will focus on developing advanced imaging modes for FASTER, including 3D blood flow imaging
(3D-BFI) and 3D shear wave elastography (3D-SWE). Pilot clinical studies will be conducted for both Aims 1 and
2 to facilitate the development and optimization of the FASTER device and imaging sequences. In Aim 3 we will
conduct a clinical study to evaluate the performance of FASTER 3D-US in characterizing suspicious axillary
lymph nodes (ALNs) for breast cancer patients undergoing clinically indicated biopsy of ALN. We will also
evaluate the performance of FASTER in localizing clipped ALNs from patients undergoing neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. The study aims will be carried out by a team of experts in ultrasound imaging, micro sensors and
systems, medical device design, and breast cancer from the campuses of University of Illinois Urbana-
Champaign, Texas A&M University, and Mayo Clinic."
10874727,"A large number of diseases are now recognized as ‘conformational diseases’, caused by protein misfolding and subsequent aggregation. One example is hepatic fibrinogen storage disease (HFSD), where the underlying cause is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention and aggregation of fibrinogen mutants, leading to liver damage, hypofibrinogenemia, and excessive bleeding. However, the molecular events underlying the biogenesis and quality control of, both wildtype and mutant fibrinogen, in the ER remain unknown. In the preliminary data of this application, we serendipitously found that the biogenesis of fibrinogen is regulated by the Sel1L-Hrd1 protein complex of the principal ER quality-control machinery, ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD represents the most evolutionarily conserved branch of ERAD and targets misfolded ER proteins for cytosolic proteasomal degradation. Hepatocyte-specific Sel1L-deficient mice exhibit fibrinogen-containing inclusions in the ER of hepatocytes, hepatic damage and hypofibrinogenemia, resembling human patients with HFSD. Indeed, both wildtype and disease-causing mutants of fibrinogens are degraded by Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD. These data point to a critical role of hepatocyte Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD in fibrinogen biogenesis and live homeostasis. Hence, the overarching hypothesis of this application is that Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD is a critical regulatory mechanism for fibrinogen biogenesis, coagulation and liver homeostasis by targeting misfolded, either wildtype or mutant, fibrinogen proteins for proteasomal degradation. This action of ERAD towards fibrinogen prevents the formation of toxic fibrinogen inclusions and aggregates in the liver. We will accomplish two Aims: (1) Demonstrate the significance and molecular mechanism of hepatic Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD in coagulation and fibrinogen biogenesis; and (2) Delineate the pathological importance of Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD in HFSD. Completion of these studies will not only delineate the significance and molecular mechanism underlying the ERAD function in early biogenesis of fibrinogen, but also have broader impact on the mechanism and therapeutical strategy for other conformational diseases associated with protein misfolding."

grow from 2,000 to 3,000 active dementia-free individuals. We will increase our geographic reach to include
more sociodemographically and racially/ethnically diverse areas in the greater Puget Sound area and will
oversample racial/ethnic minorities to achieve a goal of over 20% racial/ethnic minority enrollment. (3) Acquire
and maintain antemortem autopsy approval and enhance communication with participants and their families to
optimize postmortem intervals (PMI) for decedents who come to autopsy. The ACT study’s extensive
infrastructure has led to >850 autopsies to date from the ACT cohort. The Clinical Core will work closely with
the Neuropathology Core to use continuous quality improvement (CQI) approaches to maximize the proportion
of consenting decedents who receive a rapid autopsy. (4) Coordinate with the Administrative and Data and
Analysis Cores to ensure state-of-the-art quality control and data documentation of all data collected by the
Clinical Core. The ACT Clinical Core builds on a quarter century of data collection from a population-based
cohort of older adults and will expand, modernize and improve ACT data collection, provide outstanding
support of Projects, Cores, and affiliated studies and those receiving ACT data through extensive data sharing
infrastructure and have a larger and more sociodemographic and racially/ethnically diverse population base.
With this U19 expansion, the Clinical Core can substantially increase ACT’s contributions to scientific
understanding of aging, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease."

Project 1: Personalized Neoantigen Vaccination and Anti-PD-1 Therapy for Glioblastoma
Summary
Current therapies for glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant primary brain cancer,
remain palliative. These tumors have responded poorly to single agent immunotherapy
approaches due to several factors including the fact that GBM is an immunologically cold tumor
with a paucity of effector T cells infiltrating the tumor microenvironment. We have developed a
personalized tumor neoantigen-targeting vaccine strategy (NeoVax) based on robust analytic
sequencing pipelines and have demonstrated marked CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to
vaccinated neoepitope peptides among patients with high-risk melanoma (Ott & Hu, Nature, 2017)
and with newly diagnosed GBM (Reskin et al., Nature 2019). Furthermore, in collaboration with
investigators from Project 3, we demonstrated that NeoVax induced a marked influx of
intratumoral immune effector cells, including CD4+ T cells with specificity to an immunizing
neoepitope into the GBM tumor microenvironment. We now extend this work by conducting a
second trial in which NeoVax will be combined with anti-PD-1 therapy for GBM patients based on
our observation that anti-PD-1 therapy broadened anti-tumor immune responses among our
melanoma patients treated with NeoVax. We have designed our trial to address the key question
whether timing of PD-1 blockade relative to neoantigen priming with NeoVax affects T cell memory
responses, based on recent work by Dr. Sharpe (Project 2) demonstrating that PD-1 signaling
critically regulates long-term T cell memory. We hypothesize anti-PD-1 therapy will improve
outcome for GBM patients undergoing NeoVax therapy and that timing of PD-1 blockade
relative to tumor neoantigen priming with NeoVax will critically influence the generation of
polyfunctional, long-term memory T cell responses. We will evaluate these hypotheses in
work organized into three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the administration of PD-1
blockade either before or after NeoVax priming in a phase 1b trial for newly diagnosed GBM
patients who are treated with standard radiotherapy. We will evaluate the strength, breadth and
state of circulating neoantigen-specific T cell responses relative to timing of PD-1 blockade
including long-term T cell memory responses among patients treated on this trial in Aim 2. We will
similarly interrogate the composition and functional states of tumor infiltrating immune cells before
and after NeoVax plus anti-PD-1 therapy in Aim 3. T cell immune responses for Aims 2 and 3 will
be analyzed in Core 1, while Core 2 will perform the computational and statistical analyses of
these data."
10876407,"Summary Project 2
Immune Checkpoint blockade (CPB) has revolutionized the care for many cancers, but clinical trials using anti-
PD-1 ICB have not had significant efficacy in GBM. GBM has a profoundly immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment (TME) promoted by immunosuppressive cell types, pathways and mediators. Thus, it is not
surprising that single CPB did not meet therapeutic expectations. The goal of Project 2 is to improve patient
outcomes following anti-PD-1/ CTLA-4 therapy in GBM by identifying rational combination therapy approaches.
We hypothesize that combining therapies to improve T cell priming and activation with anti-PD-1/ CTLA-4 therapy
will significantly increase response rates in GBM, converting these immunologically “cold” tumors into “hot”
tumors. Based on our preliminary data showing that selective loss of PD-1 at different stages of T cell
differentiation can either promote or antagonize effector and memory differentiation, we further hypothesize that
the timing of PD-1/ CTLA-4 blockade in combinatorial regimens may critically influence protective anti-tumor T
cell responses. Project 2 will test these hypotheses using three complementary approaches that evaluate timing
of PD-1 blockade combined with vaccination, oncolytic virus vaccine therapy, or targeted therapies in the
following aims: 1- Determine the effect of peptide vaccination combined with anti-PD-1/ CTLA-4 therapy
on the establishment of anti-tumor immune responses and development of immunological memory; 2-
Test if addition of an oncolytic virus boost to GBM cell vaccine further increases sensitivity to anti-PD-
1/ CTLA-4; and 3- Evaluate the ability of small molecule CDK4/6 targeted therapies to enhance therapeutic

described in the Proposal. Our findings will provide optimal ways to combine therapies and insights into the

Toxoplasma gondii is the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, a leading cause of death due to foodborne illness
that causes serious disease in immunocompromised individuals. The parasite develops asexually and
sexually, and asexual parasite development is well-studied. However, the parasite completes its sexual stage
only in the cat intestinal epithelium, presenting a significant ethical and logistical barrier to sexual stage
research. To remove the need for companion animal research and study the unknown biology of sexual stage
T. gondii, our lab developed murine and tissue culture models that support T. gondii sexual development. The
polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid is a critical factor for T. gondii to complete sexual development that is
uniquely elevated in the feline intestine. The mechanisms by which linoleic acid acts on host or parasite remain
unknown. The goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanism of linoleic acid in promoting T. gondii sexual
development in cell culture and in vivo. Preliminary data from our group and others suggests that linoleic acid
acts on both host and parasite to promote a permissive environment for T. gondii sexual development. I
hypothesize that intracellular accumulation of linoleic acid activates T. gondii lipid signaling pathways to
promote sexual development. I further hypothesize that sexual development relies on activation of similar
signaling pathways in the host. In Aim 1, I will determine the mechanism of linoleic acid action on the parasite
by measuring parasite transcriptional responses to linoleic acid treatment. I will also test our new mouse model
of linoleic acid accumulation for its ability to promote efficient T. gondii sexual development in vivo. In Aim 2, I
will use automated image analysis to determine the importance of host cell type in T. gondii sexual
development. siRNA-mediated ablation of linoleic acid-responsive host factors will identify host genes that
influence sexual development. Successful completion of these Aims will better define how linoleic acid enables
growth of T. gondii sexual stages. The long-term implication of this work is a shareable model of T. gondii
sexual development that will help reduce the burden of toxoplasmosis."

The number of patients with potentially curable, stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is increasing,
and appropriate treatment selection depends upon the extent of cancer spread to lymph nodes. Two lymph
node biopsy procedures—endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial node aspiration (EBUS) and
mediastinoscopy—have equivalent ability to detect the presence of lymph node metastases, but they have not
been compared in their ability to detect the extent of cancer spread or differentially influence quality-adjusted
life years. The extent of cancer spread influences treatment decisions, which in turn impact patient outcomes.
Since EBUS and mediastinoscopy can both access the same mediastinal lymph nodes, but EBUS can also
biopsy hilar lymph nodes, EBUS is hypothesized to have greater potential to change treatment decisions (Aim
I). EBUS is also hypothesized to be associated with higher quality-adjusted life years because it has greater
potential to change treatment decisions and it is associated with fewer risks compared to mediastinoscopy
(Aim II). Aim I will leverage an ongoing cohort study with granular data on ~2,200 patients with stage I-III
NSCLC who underwent EBUS or mediastinoscopy in two Cancer Research Network health care systems
(R01CA258352). Trained clinicians will abstract granular data from radiology, biopsy, and pathology reports.
Aim II will leverage patient-level data from Aim I, the literature, and primary data collection of health utilities
associated with treatment changes in response to staging and procedure-related complications to simulate
trials using a published risk-benefit framework based on decision analytic modelling. Findings from this study
will harmonize disparate national practice guidelines for first-line biopsy procedures, direct quality improvement
initiatives, and motivate trials comparing patient-centered outcomes. This line of investigation is expected to
reduce diagnostic errors, optimize treatment selection, and improve patient outcomes. Dr. Rudasill will pursue
a two-year research fellowship at the University of Washington (UW) free of clinical responsibilities under the
mentorship of Dr. Farhood Farjah— National Cancer Institute funded thoracic surgeon-scientist and principal
investigator of the parent study. Her training goals are: 1) fulfill coursework leading to a Master of Science in
Health Services Research and enroll in elective doctoral level courses at the UW School of Public Health; 2)
conduct hypothesis-testing investigations addressing critical gaps in knowledge within the field of thoracic
oncology; 3) participate in mentored scientific and career development; and 4) develop a broad network of
mentors and collaborators. She will be embedded within the infrastructure and research environment of an
existing T32 training program at the UW Surgical Outcomes Research Center that has trained surgical
residents for 13 years. This structured, highly mentored, and diversely networked research training experience
will facilitate Dr. Rudasill’s career goal of becoming an independently funded thoracic surgeon-scientist."

We are organizing the second Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the topic of “The Hypothalamus,”
(referred to hereafter as the Hypothalamus GRC) scheduled to take place July 28 - August 2, 2024 at Bates
College in Lewiston, ME. This GRC will be held in conjunction with an associated Gordon Research Seminar
(GRS) from July 27-28, 2024 at the same location.
The hypothalamus is a highly complex vertebrate brain structure composed of numerous small populations of
neurons that collectively regulate important biological functions necessary for survival. Dysregulation of the
hypothalamus causes a number of diseases including neuropsychiatric conditions, disorders of sleep, eating,
and metabolism, deficits in growth, development, and fertility, and more. Because of its importance for
organismal survival, the hypothalamus is the subject of extensive investigation across multiple disciplines and
multiple levels of investigation. Scientists who study the hypothalamus use diverse classical and cutting-edge
techniques in a variety of model organisms. In recent years, scientists have made surprising advances in
understanding the structure and function of the hypothalamus, generating many new questions and areas of
investigation that require cross-disciplinary approaches.
The ultimate goal of the Hypothalamus GRC is to bring a diverse group of scientists together from a variety of
disciplines to share and discuss novel insights, experimental approaches, and therapeutic potential of recent
findings. Our program will have sessions on the role of the hypothalamus in a variety of health-related
behaviors including ingestive behaviors, thermoregulation and metabolism, sleep and circadian rhythms, stress
and anxiety, and social interactions. Other sessions will focus on hypothalamic regulation of the
neuroendocrine system, the brain body interface, and competing homeostatic demands. Taken together, this
GRC will allow for extraordinary interaction between scientists who study the hypothalamus across many
biological disciplines. The associated GRS will allow graduate student and postdoctoral trainees additional
opportunities to share their work and interact with a diverse group of peers. As for all GRCs, the guiding
principle of this meeting will be the presentation of new, unpublished results with free, unencumbered
discussion. We will emphasize participation of scientists at all career levels, especially PhD students, postdocs,
and early career scientists, with a particular focus on promoting diversity and inclusion."

Opioids significantly decrease bone density and subsequently increase fracture risk, but preclinical studies
addressing potential mechanisms are lacking. The nervous system is a primary target of opioids through
activation of opioid receptors, and the innervation of bone, specifically by sensory neurons, is integral for bone
homeostasis. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and can be
secreted to affect various cell types, including bone cells. We have developed a model of opioid-induced bone
loss through systemic morphine treatment, which significantly reduced trabecular bone microarchitecture, bone
formation, and circulating miRNAs in male mice. Furthermore, several of the circulating miRNAs we identified
were also significantly decreased in the bone of morphine-treated mice and have known associations with
bone outcomes and/or opioid use. miRNA, miR-484 may be integral to reduced osteoblast mineralization
based on high expression in healthy mouse and human bone, and it targets genes relevant to osteoblasts. This
proposal will test the hypothesis that morphine suppresses neuronal miRNA expression, which impairs
sensory-osteoblast communication through changes in gene expression and contributes to overall bone loss.
In Aim 1, we will explore the mechanism of miRNA suppression by morphine through decreased biogenesis
and/or secretion within the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which house the cell bodies of sensory neurons.
Specifically, we will treat mice with morphine for 2 or 4 weeks and determine how miRNA expression,
biogenesis, and secretion are associated with progressive bone loss. Conditioned media treatment of primary
osteoblasts from morphine-treated DRG will determine whether morphine indirectly impairs osteoblast
mineralization. In Aim 2, we will identify the specific role of miR-484 in osteoblast function through in situ
analysis of miR-484 in femora of morphine-treated mice as well as overexpression or knockdown of miR-484 in
primary osteoblasts. miR-484 gene targets will be assessed at the gene and protein level in addition to
identification of novel genes and pathways impacted by miR-484 through RNA sequencing. I will be trained and
mentored by experts in the field at MHIR and external consultants, which will support my transition to a
postdoctoral fellow focused on skeletal health. Findings will expand our understanding of opioid-induced bone
loss through neural-skeletal miRNA communication. Further preclinical studies may then develop strategies to
mitigate opioid-induced bone loss and inform clinical decisions in the face of the ongoing opioid epidemic."

 Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), a rare monogenic neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a trinucleotide
expansion of the Fmr1 gene on the X chromosome. FXS is the most common inherited form of intellectual
disability (ID) and monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), characterized by sensory
hypersensitivities, executive dysfunction, learning difficulties, and social anxiety. Individuals with FXS also exhibit
increased functional connectivity (FC) abnormalities observed using electroencephalography (EEG) related to
cognitive impairments and behavioral features of FXS, with a high degree of heterogeneity (despite being
monogenic). Limited work has addressed these FC disruptions in frontoparietal, and temporal networks with no
studies directly assessing FC disruptions during a cognitive task. I hypothesize specific network connectivity
dynamics within frontoparietal and temporal regions in FXS will effectively parse higher-order behavioral features
of FXS from ID, with frontoparietal FC disruption related to the “control network” being more associated with both
ID and cognitive control (including cognitive/behavioral flexibility) and temporal “salience network” FC more
associated with other FXS features, particularly sensory hypersensitivity and anxiety. The long-term goal of this
proposal is to characterize functional disruptions in networks underlying ID and cognitive function as separate
from behavioral features of FXS to identify targets for intervention while using a cognitive task and address
heterogeneity in neural network performance underlying features core to FXS (e.g., hyperactivity, sensory
processing difficulties, anxiety). Experiments proposed in Aim 1 will use robust FC measures through a source
analysis to parse ID from other features of FXS to evaluate the effectiveness of using microstates as a proxy
and to explore the triple network hypothesis in FXS by assessing FC during a cognitive task. Aim 2 will utilize
data-driven methods to identify variable combinations from EEG to meaningfully distinguishing FXS from
individuals with developmental delay (DD), and parse cognitive ability/ID (defined by NIH Toolbox for ID and
nonverbal IQ) from other FXS features (i.e., anxiety, hyperactivity, sensory hypersensitivities). The proposed
project will have broad implications for ongoing efforts to evaluate neurophysiology in FXS and the development
of effective biomarkers for therapeutic applications, particularly taking the novel approach of addressing FC
during a cognitive task."
10903982,"Due to the high stakes of healthcare, the primary barrier is the extremely low tolerance of errors in
healthcare practice, which requires extremely high sensitivity and specificity of any modelling. However,
nearly all Machine learning (ML) models focus on improving the accuracy. It cannot yet reach both
 extremely high sensitivity and specificity using healthcare data. Separate screening and confirmatory ML
 tools are proposed to achieve very high sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, many ML algorithms suffer
 from the lack of clear explanations, such as deep learning and neural networks, and would unlikely meet
 the FAIR criteria. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S. The number of cancer survivors
 continues to grow; unfortunately, so does the number of non-cancer deaths in cancer patients. However,
nearly all `omic and large population studies focused on binary outcomes (cancer death or recurrence).
 Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand and reduce non-cancer deaths in cancer patients,
 using `omic and population data. To address these problems, the project will develop screening and
confirmatory ML to model cancer and noncancer deaths in breast, colorectal, prostate and lung cancer
 patients using `omic data and electronic health records (EHR). The proposed research will result in
 fundamental contribution to ML tools, workflows and methods to make novel use of `omic and EHR data
 for cancer care. It timely meets the urgent needs in precise reduction of non-cancer deaths. This project
 also uniquely addresses the Transformative Data Science research theme. The interdisciplinary
collaboration in this project as outlined in the Collaboration Plan will offer a diverse basis for creative
 problem solving and validation. The proposal has 3 broader impacts: 1) The developed novel ML
 algorithms and technology will enable physicians to more precisely prognosticate and treat cancer
 patients based on their risk of multicategory deaths. 2) The research program will support and nurture
undergraduate and graduate researchers. 3) The proposed research program will support high school and
undergraduate students both in the conduct of research and in awareness of ML usefulness."

For the last 30 years, the 5-year survival rate of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has been less than 7% despite
the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors as treatment options. Therapies like immune checkpoint inhibitors
that aim to reengage an immune response may not succeed for SCLC as previous studies have shown
downregulation of MHC molecules, low PD-L1 expression and limited immune infiltration. However, SCLC is
often associated with autoantibody-driven Paraneoplastic Syndromes, providing evidence for the
immunogenicity of SCLC. We propose that chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-Ts) as a novel approach for
SCLC immunotherapy that overcomes impediments to endogenous immunity. CAR-Ts are synthetically
engineered to fuse antibody ligand binding domains with costimulatory components that activate T cells after
engagement of cell surface antigens, and have had considerable success in leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple
myeloma. The microenvironment of SCLC is phenotypically closer to CAR-T responsive lymphoma than many
solid tumors where CAR-Ts have thus far had limited success. A challenge for CAR-T cells in many solid tumors
is the identification of target antigens that are tumor-specific. We have identified 13 novel cell surface antigen
and here will prioritize 3 with high prevalence in SCLC. Each of these antigens have post-translational
modifications that act as neoantigens and lead to autoantibody production in a high percentage of SCLC cases.
We will capture these neoantigen-autoantibodies from SCLC patient-derived B cells, sequence the tumor specific
binding sequences, and design and test CARs constructed from the single chain variable fragments (scFvs).
The benefit of isolating autoantibodies from SCLC patients to detect tumor-specific neoantigens is three-fold: 1.
The antigens identified have already proven to be immunogenic; 2. The variable regions of these human
autoantibodies can be directly engineered into ligand binding domains of CAR-T cells; and 3. Autoantibodies
can be detected in the blood of patients and serve as tissue surrogate biomarkers to guide CAR-T cell target
selection. The CAR-T cells we develop will be rigorously tested in multiple preclinical models that address
complementary but non-overlapping therapeutic barriers. These include testing CAR-T cell tumor infiltration,
efficacy and toxicity in a library of genetically diverse SCLC patient derived xenografts and identifying, then
overcoming, immunosuppressive mechanisms in the immune competent Rb/p53 genetically engineered mouse
model. Our team of experts in lung cancer, autoantibody biomarkers, immunology and CAR-T cells is well
equipped to execute the development of novel immunotherapies that are desperately needed in SCLC."

This proposal is focused on the development of improved therapies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
The central premise of our all our work is that AML is driven by a biologically distinct leukemia stem cell
(LSC) population. While the conceptual importance of targeting leukemic disease at its root is clear,
studies in recent years have demonstrated that the inherent intra-patient heterogeneity of LSC
populations makes complete eradication a very challenging objective for most patients. Our studies
have therefore attempted to identify common foundational properties of primary human LSCs that can
employed in the development of therapeutic strategies in the hope that intrinsic heterogeneity can be
overcome. Of particular interest, we have described distinct metabolic properties in LSCs, that provide
new opportunities for intervention. Specifically, inhibition of BCL2 acts to inhibit oxidative
phosphorylation in LSCs, resulting in selective eradication of the LSC population. Recent translation
of this observation to clinical studies has demonstrated strong efficacy for newly diagnosed AML
patients, and appears to be on the verge of altering the current standard of care. Despite these exciting
advances though, relapse remains common and further elucidation of LSC properties is essential. To
this end, we have recently begun to describe the mechanisms that drive relapse of AML patients
following treatment with a BCL2 inhibitor. These studies have identified entirely unexpected and new
aspects of LSC biology that have important ramifications for our basic understanding of AML, as well
as the design of improved therapeutic regimens. Specifically, we have demonstrated that at least two
distinct LSC populations can co-exist in the same patient. The genetic, epigenetic, and metabolic
properties of co-resident LSC subpopulations can vary, giving rise to differing levels of drug
responsiveness. The focus of our studies going forward will be to understand and exploit these findings
towards the goal of improved outcomes for AML patients."

Skin epithelia provides a multimodal barrier that protects us against the external world, essential for water
retention, mechanical protection, sensory perception, and immune surveillance. Skin on the ventral aspect of the
feet and hands, known as palmoplantar or glabrous skin, bears higher mechanical stress in daily life; however,
the cellular and molecular components that convey mechanical resilience in this specialized tissue are only
partially understood. As an adaptation to the unique stresses it experiences, the epidermis of palmoplantar skin
maintains an intricate pattern of keratin protein expression. Keratins are intermediate filament (IF) forming
proteins whose expression patterns are tightly regulated in response to developmental stage, differentiation, and
stress in epithelial tissues. Importantly, the type I keratin 9 (KRT9/K9) is specifically expressed, at high levels, in
differentiating keratinocytes of the epidermis in human and mouse glabrous skin. The type 1 keratin 16
(KRT16/K16), associated with damage response in interfollicular epidermis, is also constitutively expressed in
the glabrous skin. Mutations in both KRT9/K9 and KRT16/K16 are associated with the formation of palmoplantar
keratoderma (PPK), characterized by hyperkeratosis of the glabrous skin. KRT9/K9 mutation patients develop
epidermolytic PPK, with tissue fragility and cell lysis observed in the suprabasal layers of the glabrous epidermis.
Krt9-/- mice, available in the Coulombe lab, recapitulate the EPPK phenotype. However, despite the clear
importance of Krt9/K9 in maintaining the homeostasis and mechanical integrity of the glabrous epidermis, recent
work in the Coulombe lab, including data in this proposal, suggest that Krt9/K9 is undetectable on the protein
level and extremely low on the mRNA level immediately prior to birth in mice. This is temporally uncoupled from
the expression of Krt9/K9’s type 2 partner, keratin 1 (Krt1/K1). Additionally, data in this proposal shows aberrant
nuclear-localized Yap1 in the suprabasal layers of the lesional glabrous skin of Krt9-/- mice, suggesting a potential
role for Krt9/K9 in regulating the mechanosensitive Hippo signaling pathway in the glabrous epidermis. In this
study, I aim to define the role and regulation of Krt9/K9 in response to stress in the developing
palmoplantar skin. I hypothesize that Krt9/K9 is responsive to mechanical stress signals, particularly the
expression of Krt16/K16, and maintains the homeostatic balance of the glabrous epidermis via negative
regulation of mechanosensitive signaling pathways, such as Hippo signaling. Completion of this work will
illuminate critical mechanisms by which the keratinocyte differentiation program adapts to physical stresses, as
well as provide insight into the pathogenesis of many keratin-linked diseases which manifest at the sites of
mechanical stress."

Oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1) is an inherited condition characterized by reduced or absent tyrosinase
(TYR) function which leads to a lack of pigment in the hair, skin, and eyes. OCA1 results in debilitating ocular
effects, including blindness, severe photosensitivity, and nystagmus. Lack of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE)
pigmentation and TYR mutations also lead to developmental anomalies of the neural retina, including foveal
hypoplasia and misrouting of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). OCA1 affects approximately 1 in 40,000 individuals
worldwide. Currently, there are no effective treatments to reverse the ocular manifestations of OCA1, making
OCA1 therapies a critical unmet clinical need. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms linking TYR mutations and
retinal malformation are incompletely understood. This proposal aims to bridge the gaps in both clinical and
scientific knowledge by leveraging state-of-the-art adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) gene therapies. OCA1 is
a prime disease candidate to benefit from AAV gene therapy as one functional copy of TYR is sufficient to restore
pigment production. In addition, gene replacement will serve as a tool to elucidate molecular mechanisms of
OCA1 retinal disease. To facilitate the development of AAV-TYR gene therapy for clinical application and to shed
light on the molecular underpinnings of ipsilateral RGC mapping in OCA1, we will (1) identify the optimal
therapeutic window and delivery route of AAV-TYR, (2) administer our novel AAV-TYR vectors at critical time
points in retinal development to rescue ipsilateral RGC fate mapping, and (3) evaluate AAV-TYR using a non-
human primate model which closely recapitulates human ocular structure and function. We will accomplish our
aims by assessing phenotypic rescue following AAV-TYR delivery at numerous time points in development
through ocular imaging and functional testing in a mouse model of OCA1. Further, we will correlate ipsilateral
RGC rescue with transcriptomic changes in various cell types within the developing retina through single cell
RNA-sequencing. Finally, we will test biocompatibility and safety of AAV-TYR therapy in wildtype rhesus
macaques, setting the stage for future testing in an OCA1-NHP model. The experiments described in this
proposal will lay the groundwork for developing an OCA1 gene therapy that improves vision and quality of life
for patients with OCA1 while also expanding our understanding of OCA1 disease mechanisms. Completion of
this proposal will result in a rigorous intellectual and technical training experience under the mentorship of an
interdisciplinary team of expert scientists and physicians. The training to be received through this proposal will
allow the applicant to accomplish their ultimate goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist investigator
with specialization in the treatment of inherited ocular diseases. In sum, this proposal will result in tangible clinical
and scientific benefits in addition to providing an avenue for comprehensive academic and professional
development."

A substantial part of our diet and health regime involves bitter food and medicine. Bitter molecules bind bitter
taste receptors (Tas2rs) and activate a sensory pathway that elicits an aversive taste sensation in the oral
cavity, mainly to avoid ingestion of toxins. Tas2rs are also found throughout the digestive tract, and bitter
stimuli in the gut aﬀect feeding behavior through gut peptide secretion and stimulation of sensory regions in
the brain through the vagus nerve. Yet, it remains to be determined how sensory signaling from ingested
bitter molecules are transduced from gut to brain. Our lab discovered a population of specialized gut
enteroendocrine cells, called neuropod cells, that detect luminal nutrients in through apical sensors and
transduce sensory signals to the brain in milliseconds, via the vagus nerve. This gut sensory pathway
regulates feeding behavior in real-time. The hypothesis of this application is that neuropod cells detect bitter
signals through Tas2rs and transduce them onto vagal neurons. Preliminary ﬁndings show that isolated small
intestinal neuropod cells are enriched for a subset of murine Tas2rs, compared to all other intestinal epithelial
cells. Expression of these Tas2rs is dynamic, as it decreases in response to bacterial endotoxins. Therefore,
neuropod cells may act as gut sensors for bitter compounds to communicate the valence of bitter molecules,
which range from toxic to medicinal. Speciﬁc aim 1 will determine whether neuropod cells are activated by
bitter stimuli through Tas2r signaling. Expression of Tas2rs and their signaling molecules will be characterized
throughout the gut and activation of neuropod cells in response to bitter molecules will be determined by
calcium imaging. The requirement of Tas2rs for bitter signaling in neuropod cells will be determined through
targeted knockouts of Tas2rs. Speciﬁc aim 2 will determine whether neuropod cells signal luminal bitter
stimuli onto vagal neurons. The signaling molecule will be identiﬁed by release assays in intestinal organoids
and single neuropod cells in response to bitter molecules, and the sensory pathway will be determined by
measuring vagal activation by electrophysiology, in response to gut infusions of bitter molecules. Finally,
pharmacological and optogenetic inhibition approaches will determine the requirement of neuropod cell
signaling for this sensory pathway. This work will uncover how bitter stimuli in the gut are conveyed to the
brain, bringing forth a new aspect of chemosensation and gut-brain communication for a variety of foods and
medicine that are essential for our health."

 Only around 5% of deaf children are born to deaf parents and subsequently get exposure to an
accessible sign language as their first language from birth (Mitchell & Karchmer, 2004). The other 95% of deaf
children are born into hearing families and are at high risk of late first language acquisition that occurs after
the critical period for language (Lenneberg, 1967). As adults, this late first language acquisition results in
dramatic and lifelong effects on everything from education to job opportunities to mental health (Hall, 2017).
Research looking at the effects of late first language acquisition on language in particular shows effects on
language outcomes and neurolinguistic processing at the word and sentence levels (e.g., Mayberry & Kluender,
2018). The preliminary data of this project show that late first language acquisition also affects the sub-word
level, known as the phonological level (Nielson & Mayberry, in review).
 When processing the phonology of a sign language, one must visually perceive and manually articulate
forms categorized into handshapes, movements, locations, and palm orientations. These categories are referred
to as parameters and native signers who acquire ASL from birth exhibit specific patterns of the parameters in
their productions and perceptual judgments (e.g., Conlin et al., 2000; Hildebrandt & Corina, 2002).
Understanding these parameter patterns provides insight into how native signers process phonology, which is
important for fully understanding language processing. Thus, investigating how late L1 signers process
phonology is crucial for fully understanding the effects of late first language acquisition on language. The
completed first study of this project looked at phonological production and found that late first language
signers exhibit a different pattern of parameter errors when compared to native signers. The proposed studies
look at phonological perception behaviorally to better understand the systematic effects of late first language
acquisition on phonological processing across production and perception (Aim 1), as well as neurolinguistically
to identify the impact of late first language acquisition on the loci and time course of phonological processing in
the brain (Aim 2). The ultimate goal of this project is to determine the relationship between the behavioral
outcomes and the neurolinguistic processing in the brain (Aim 3) to better understand the causes of disordered
communication for deaf late L1 signers and prevent them.
 Identifying the impact of late first language acquisition on phonological processing behaviorally and
neurolinguistically is crucial for a greater characterization of the communication of deaf individuals and a
deeper understanding of the brain causes associated with normal function and disordered processes of
communication. This project will also enhance the applicant’s research training and greatly improve her ability
to transition from a graduate student to a productive and independent researcher who is an expert in deaf
communication and sign language processing."

Tissue wide patterning is integral to robust development in multicellular organisms, requiring
individual cells to generate polarity axes and coordinate this information in space and time. In
order to establish cell polarity individual cells must first `break symmetry'. Imaging symmetry
breaking in vivo suggests this is not a stochastic process, instead, symmetry breaking events are
coordinated with in tissues and interconnected across the embryo. Using the C. elegans embryo,
I will take a systems level approach to identify patterns of symmetry breaking events in the embryo
that underlie synchronized, reproducible cell polarization needed for proper development. The
Feldman lab has developed the C. elegans intestine as a tractable model to define cell- and
tissue-level symmetry breaking events in the in vivo context of the developing embryo. The first
cellular-level asymmetry we observe is the formation of `local polarity complexes' (LPCs). These
macromolecular assemblies subsequently move coordinately to seed and establish the future
apical surface, defining tissue-level asymmetry. In the proposed experiments, I will probe
molecular assemblies to identify conserved mechanisms of polarity complex formation (aims 1 &
2) and ask if mechanical inputs are upstream of directed symmetry breaking in epithelia in vivo
(aim 3). The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify where asymmetric information comes
from to inform polarity programs in developing epithelia. Together these aims will inform core
mechanisms of cell polarity establishment that are essential for organismal development and are
key to maintaining healthy epithelia and preventing disruption of polarity programs that underlie
disease states such as congenital malformations and tumorigenesis."
10872934,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The brain and spinal cord are filled with and surrounded by a complex fluid, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF
directly contacts brain progenitors to act as a stem cell niche that provides buoyancy, ionic and osmotic balance,
and health- and growth- promoting factors. Pathological deviations in CSF volume and composition are
associated with congenital, neuropsychiatric, infectious, and geriatric diseases, as well as injury. As the brain
matures during development, CSF composition changes profoundly. We recently discovered that CSF ion
concentrations also change dramatically across development, including a ~2.5-fold drop in CSF [K+] during the
first postnatal week in rodents (from ~10 mM to ~3.2 mM). This large natural shift in CSF [K+] has the potential
to affect key processes in brain development including progenitor maintenance, neurogenesis, and physiology.
Our lab has the tools and expertise to directly control CSF [K+] and assess neurodevelopmental outcomes.
Extracellular K+ is a fundamental signal for proliferation, survival, and cellular migration. K+ is also a key ion
regulating cellular physiology, excitability, and ion co-transport. It is therefore crucial to understand how
developmentally dynamic CSF ions contribute to brain generation and maturation. A major tissue source of CSF
ions is the choroid plexus. We found that choroid plexus-restricted knockdown or overexpression of the sodium-
potassium-chloride cotransporter NKCC1 (Slc12a2) delays or accelerates the drop in CSF [K+], respectively. It
is now possible to directly test hypotheses that stage-specific CSF ions support neural progenitors and immature
neurons to drive long-term brain function. Here, we propose to answer fundamental, yet transformative
questions of whether CSF ions are necessary and sufficient to support brain development.
Here we adapt explant manipulation and in vivo AAV gene delivery to investigate how the higher [K+] that we
observe in early CSF specifically supports early neurodevelopment (aim 1); how the lower [K+] that we observed
in postnatal CSF specifically supports neural maturation (aim 2); and test whether the shift in CSF [K+] alters the
Cl- and K+ shunting that occurs as part of the developmental GABA switch (aim 3). This multi-tiered approach
will yield widely applicable information and tools for testing hypotheses of CSF ion function over development,
and in health and disease. Each component builds on my unique expertise to facilitate a new research program
investigating how CSF supports the maturation of neurons and circuits underlying psychiatric disease.
This innovative research program will fundamentally change our understanding of brain development
and reveal roles for CSF ions in supporting brain generation and physiology. The CSF is an accessible avenue
for CNS surveillance or supplementation, even in humans (e.g. intranasal spray, intrathecal injections).
Therefore, outcomes will guide efforts to harness CSF to provide a supportive developmental environment for
the brain, reduce neurologic symptoms, and may provide therapeutic strategies for tackling a range of disease."

 Zimmermann-Laband syndrome 3 (ZLS3 [MIM: 618658]) is a rare genetic developmental disorder
characterized by gingival enlargement, developmental delay, intellectual disability, together with abnormal
fingers, fingernails, nose, and ears. Small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ subtype 3 (KCa2.3) channels are
activated exclusively by intracellular Ca2+. There are seven human genetic mutations of KCa2.3 linked to ZLS31-
3 and one mutation associated with idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH)4. No treatment for ZLS3
exists. We recently reported that the ZLS3-related mutations in KCa2.3 increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of the
channels more than the INCPH-related mutation5. We hypothesize that disease-related KCa2.3 mutations cause
abnormally elevated Ca2+ sensitivity of the channel, a theory that will be tested in Aim 1.
 To correct the abnormally elevated Ca2+ sensitivity, we will need to understand the mechanisms of how Ca2+
sensitivity is increased by the KCa2.3 mutations. These mutations can be separated into three clusters in the
channel protein1-3. The first cluster are localized at a region that we reported essential for channel gating6. The
second cluster are reported to interact with casein kinase 2 (CK2)7. CK2 phosphorylates calmodulin (CaM)
constitutively associated with KCa2.3 channels and thus negatively modulates Ca2+ sensitivity8, 9. The last
mutation, A287S, is in the transmembrane S1 domain. We postulated that the first cluster of five mutations in
KCa2.3 may enlarge the channel gate and make the channel easier to open as the mechanism for their elevated
sensitivity to Ca2+. The second cluster of mutant KCa2.3 channels may not affect the channel gate directly but
rather CK2 phosphorylation. The mechanisms for the elevated Ca2+ sensitivity of ZLS3-related mutant channels
will be elucidated in Aim 2.
 As the KCa2.3 mutations elevate the Ca2+ sensitivity through differential mechanisms, the seven ZLS3-related
KCa2.3 mutations may also lead to different sensitivities to channel inhibitors. In our preliminary studies, the effect
of AP14145, a negative gating modulator, on the mutant channels was less prominent than on the wild-type
channels5, highlighting the need for compounds that inhibit mutant channels. We will explore FDA-approved
drugs and compounds in clinical trials that have been reported to inhibit KCa2.3 channels as candidates for off-
label or compassionate use in Aim 3.
 PUBLIC HEALTHE RELEVANCE: There are seven human genetic mutations of KCa2.3 linked to ZLS31-3
and one mutation associated with idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH)4. We will explore FDA-
approved drugs and compounds in clinical trials that inhibit KCa2.3 channels as candidates for off-label or
compassionate use."

Hepatocytes exhibit compartmental (zonated) functions along the sinusoid with as many as 50% of liver genes
thought to be zonated. The initiation and progression of several diseases can show a zonated bias including
drug-induced liver injury, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The fetal liver is not
zonated and thus zonation begins after birth due to gradients of O2, hormones, nutritional stimuli, and non-
parenchymal cell (NPC) secretions acting on common pathways. As complementary tools to live animal studies,
in vitro hepatocyte +/- NPC cultures subjected to specific factor gradients within fluidic devices can enable a
more detailed understanding of the regulators and functional outcomes of zonation. However, previous in vitro
platforms/studies have only been able to recapitulate limited features and an incomplete understanding of
hepatic zonation. We have pioneered a droplet microfluidics platform for the high-throughput generation of
reproducibly-sized 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) microgels (<300 µm) containing primary hepatocytes that
display liver functions for 4+ weeks in vitro when the microgels are coated with primary liver sinusoidal endothelial
cells (LSECs); microtissues can be further augmented with hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and Kupffer cells (KCs).
We have also developed microfluidic devices that enable precise microscale and spatial control over the O2
environment of cells with higher resolution than afforded for by conventional devices; such devices also uniquely
allow decoupling of the effects of O2 from other soluble factor gradients that are typically induced via perfusion.
Additionally, our data shows that primary rat and human hepatocytes display differential regulation of phenotypic
functions when subjected to in vivo-like O2 tensions over prolonged culture. Here, we will test our novel
hypothesis that microtissues can be used within custom microfluidic platforms to elucidate the roles of different
soluble factor gradients, individually and in controlled combinations, on the long-term phenotypic responses of
multiple liver cell types from rats and humans. In aims 1 and 2, we will elucidate the effects of physiological O2
tensions and the effects of hormonal and nutrient gradients on the long-term functions of rat and human liver
microtissues, respectively. Lastly, in aim 3, we will utilize microfluidic devices that enable multiple overlapping
soluble factor gradients to elucidate the effects of gradient crosstalk on multicellular zonation in rat and human
liver microtissues. The detailed investigations here will be the first-of-their kind and will significantly increase our
understanding of how key factor gradients and heterotypic cell-cell signaling affects liver zonation across human
and rodents, which can be useful for building physiologically-relevant liver tissues for drug development across
its various phases and ultimately regenerative medicine. Lastly, the microfluidic tools developed here can serve
as a community resource to probe molecular mechanisms underlying liver zonation and how it affects the
initiation and progression of several liver diseases and chemical-induced liver injury."

The septal complex which regulates a wide range of social, and emotional behaviors can be classified into medial
(MS) and lateral (LS) regions. The medial septum is composed of cholinergic and GABAergic neurons that
primarily project to the hippocampus. The lateral septum is composed of a diverse array of GABAergic projection
neurons that receives reciprocal input from numerous brain regions known to regulate emotional and motivational
states. The lateral septal nuclei are strongly implicated in stress and anxiety where previous studies indicate a
role for the septum in both promoting and suppressing anxiety related behavior, including circuits involved in
mediating enduring behavioral changes resulting from early life stress and social trauma. Dysfunction of septal
neurons is thought to play a significant role in the pathophysiology of a variety of psychiatric disorders including
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and anxiety-related disorders. Despite our growing appreciation for
the importance of septal nuclei circuit function in modulating social, emotional and affective behaviors we know
very little about the specific functions of the diverse septal neuron types and even less about the developmental
mechanisms that create this diversity. The overall goal of this research proposal is to identify the key genetic
and molecular pathways that underlie the developmental logic for the functional specialization of diverse
neuronal cell types in the septum. Our studies will provide a framework for assessing the development and
behavioral function of other septal neuron types and uncover targets for novel treatments for neuropsychiatric
disorders that may arise from septal circuit dysfunction."

Layer 2/3 projection neurons (PNs) are critical nodes in association cortico-cortical (Ac-c) circuits, and likely
targets of neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) pathology. In mouse models of 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome
(22q11DS), which in humans confers risk for multiple clinically defined NDDs, Ac-c circuits are under-
connected, in part due to diminished layer 2/3 PN growth accompanied by mitochondrial oxidative stress. We
will use mouse 22q11DS genetic models to test the hypothesis that Ac-c circuit pathology in NDD reflects
selective, mitochondria-dependent developmental dysregulation of layer 2/3 PN long-range
connections, leading to disordered synaptic organization, disconnection, and dysfunction. We combine
genetic, physiological, transcriptomic, proteomic, and behavioral approaches to assess how 22q11 deletion
alters identity and function of layer 2/3 PNs to result in individually variable behavior and circuit pathology. In
Specific Aim 1 we determine whether excitatory (E) vs. inhibitory (I) synaptic sites on layer 2/3 PNs that make
long-range connections are altered by NDD pathogenesis, including that due to 22q11 deletion, leading to Ac-c
circuit disconnection and dysfunction. Our data will provide foundational insight into cellular, physiological and
transcriptional identities of typical layer 2/3 Ac-c vs. 5/6 PNs, as well as consequences of NDD pathology for
E/I balance in circuits defined by long-range Ac-c connections. In Specific Aim 2, we assess mitochondrial
function in developing layer 2/3 PNs as they generate pre- and post-synaptic domains to define mature
microcircuits. We analyze how NDD pathogenesis due to 22q11 deletion disrupts developing and mature
mitochondrial regulation of Ac-c connectivity. Our data will provide fundamental characterization of
mitochondria deployment, bioenergetics, and proteomic identities in typical developing and mature layer 2/3 vs.
5/6 PNs, including mitochondria at layer 2/3 PN synapses. In parallel, we will define how mitochondrial identity
and function is compromised by 22q11 deletion. In Specific Aim 3, we analyze how mitochondrial antioxidant
defense influences behaviors that rely upon long range Ac-c connections made by layer 2/3 PNs. We assess
individual variability in cognitive, mnemonic, sensory gating and social behaviors. Our data will resolve whether
a specific dimension of mitochondrial function—clearance of reactive oxygen species generated by oxidative
phosphorylation—varies individually to disrupt Ac-c circuit dependent behaviors and circuits. Data collected
from these Specific Aims will provide a framework for understanding optimal mitochondrial regulation of Ac-c
circuit development and function and its disruption in NDDs. We will resolve contributions of mitochondrial
function and antioxidant defense to 22q11 deletion-mediated Ac-c disconnection and related behavioral
deficits. Our work will define whether emerging therapies, including antioxidants and other metabolic
interventions can restore or preserve essential connections and function in NDD."
10906090,"ABSTRACT (30 Lines)
The BRAIN initiative (RFA-EB-19-002) has called for the development of entirely new or next-generation
noninvasive human brain imaging tools and methods that will lead to transformative advances in our
understanding of the human brain. Functional MRI (fMRI) at ultrahigh fields has made tremendous improvements
in spatiotemporal resolution, allowing brain function to be studied on the level of cortical layers and columns.
However, fMRI is generally considered to have a low sensitivity and strong tissue background for detection of
function. Positron emission tomography provides powerful metabolic imaging through radioactive tracers but
suffers low spatial resolution, as is diffuse optical tomography despite its advantages in speed, cost, and
portability. Ultrasound-only imaging cannot image adult human brains because the ultrasonic waves are
attenuated and aberrated twice by the skull due to the round-trip propagation.
 To address these issues, we propose to develop 3D photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) for fast
and ultrafast large-scale neural activity imaging in human brains. PACT is especially well suited for detecting
hemodynamic changes related to neural activities. It offers comparable spatial resolution but can be made much
faster than fMRI. It is directly sensitive to both oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin linearly with a low tissue background.
Other potential benefits of PACT over fMRI include open imaging platforms, minimal site requirements, quiet and
bedside operation, magnet-free environment, and low system maintenance.
 In the last two decades, we have developed photoacoustic technology at multiple spatial scales ranging from
microscopic (subcellular and cellular) to macroscopic (whole rodent, whole human breast, ex vivo adult human
skull, and preliminary single-channel 2D and 64-channel 3D in vivo adult human brain) imaging. We have
revealed hemodynamic response in the rodent brain to whisker or electrical stimulation and mapped the resting-
state functional connectivity of the rat brain in the deep thalamic region. We have also developed sophisticated
numerical methods for simulating photoacoustic wave propagation in heterogeneous media and developed
frameworks for image reconstruction in acoustically heterogeneous media. Further, we have successfully
demonstrated ex vivo PACT through adult human skulls and acquired preliminary images of human heads in
vivo. We propose to translate these advances in PACT to human brain imaging through two specific aims:
Aim 1: Develop massively parallel high-speed 3D PACT for in vivo fast and ultrafast functional human brain
imaging.
Aim 2: Validate functional PACT in adult humans in vivo by comparing with ultrahigh-field 7 T fMRI."
10899425,"SUMMARY - HUMANIZED MOUSE CORE (CORE A)
The huNSG mouse model nicely recapitulates aspects of human biology that are not supported in other
systems. This humanized mouse model also offers the only small animal model capable of supporting HCMV
infection, latency, and reactivation. This PPG requires our highly standardized huNSG model in order to
effectively characterize unique conditions and quantitatively differentiate viral growth and dissemination of
different viral mutants and treatments. Core A will provide the infrastructure and knowledge required for
completion of the proposed research projects involving huNSG mice and standardize analysis between all
projects to allow for direct comparisons. By working directly with the Project leaders, Core A will aid in
designing and execution of the proposed experiments."
10899426,"SUMMARY - BIOSTATISTICS AND BIOINFORMATICS CORE (CORE B)
The Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (Core B) serves as the translational catalyst for the PPG by integrating
the diverse ‘omics’ data readouts to develop systems-level mathematical models to help advance the molecular
understanding of HCMV latency and reactivation. Core B works in close collaboration with the PPG research
projects and the other cores to provide pre-processing, analysis, modeling and computational support as well
as development of timely new methods through cutting-edge computational methods development; outreach
support; and assistance with dissemination. To achieve the full potential of the PPG center, it is essential that
data be accessible—in terms of both security (i.e., having secure, ready access) and interpretability (i.e., is high
quality, contextual and information rich). Core B serves as the data steward for the PPG. The goal of Core B is
to support all aspects of the data life cycle starting at data generation. The Core B team will build upon its
extensive data management, data standardization, biostatistical, multi-omics, and bioinformatics expertise to
ensure reproducible, transparent workflows and protocols that maximize knowledge extraction."
10899427,"SUMMARY – PROJECT 1
The goal of our Program is to elucidate molecular mechanisms by which HCMV regulates host signaling in CD34+
hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) for the establishment and maintenance of viral latency and reactivation
from latency. HCMV remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after solid organ and hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation despite advances in diagnostics and therapeutics. HCMV latency is complex and the
signaling mechanisms for establishment and maintenance of HCMV latency, as well as for reactivation of virus
are poorly understood. Our program has identified a number of viral proteins and miRNAs that regulate latency
and reactivation by targeting host pathways. The complexity of signaling events and approaches to
comprehensively address questions on viral latency and hematopoiesis can only be achieved through a
collaborative effort. Using state-of-the art in vitro models in human CD34+ HPCs and in vivo models in
humanized mice, our Program will address the individual and combined roles of viral factors modulating host
signaling. Our Project (Project 1) will address the roles of the latency determinant UL138 in modulating host
signaling pathways regulated through its interactions with ubiquitin specific protease (USP) complexes that
regulate STAT1 and AKT signaling. We have defined interactions between UL138 and WDR48 and WDR20,
which serve as a scaffold to activate USP1, USP12, and USP46. We hypothesize that UL138-host interactions
with WDR/USP complexes coordinate signaling to regulate the switch between latency and reactivation. In Aim
1, we will determine how UL138 impacts WDR48/USP complexes and function. We will map the amino acids in
UL138 that are required for interaction with WDR48/USP complexes and generate recombinant viruses defective
for these interactions. In Aim 2, we will determine how UL138-WDR48/USP interactions impact latency and
reactivation and the role of UL138 in activating STAT1 and AKT using recombinant viruses and knockdown of
host factors. Aim 3 will expand our understanding of the regulation of STAT1 and AKT signaling by analyzing a
greater network of regulators, proteins and miRNAs, that regulate STAT1 and AKT signaling to drive outcomes
of infection in collaboration with Project 2 and Project 3. Collectively, our projects will provide the first
comprehensive and mechanistic insights into the multi-faceted regulation of host signaling for the control of
HCMV latency. The network of viral and host factors we have identified uniquely position us to define novel host
and viral targets for antiviral strategies to control HCMV latency or reactivation. Our collaborative approach will
provide unparalleled insights into the complex multi-factorial mechanisms regulating HCMV latency and
reactivation."
10899429,"SUMMARY - PROJECT 2
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivation from latency remains a serious complication under conditions of
immunosuppression. Latency and reactivation are complex processes regulated by a subset of viral proteins and
non-coding RNAs in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). The goal of this project is to define how
HCMV microRNAs (miRNAs) refine and shape signaling mediated by viral proteins critical for the entry into and
exit from latency. We have previously determined that HCMV miRNAs interfere with multiple pathways in latently-
infected cells, including TGF, MEK/ERK and RhoA that have critical implications for HCMV latency. Importantly,
we have uncovered a role for HCMV miRNAs acting both in coordination and in opposition to viral proteins. For
example, in order to regulate apoptosis early after infection of CD34+ HPCs, miR-US5-1 and miR-UL112-3p act
in concert with UL7 (Project 4) to reduce the levels and activity of FOXO3a. In contrast, HCMV miR-US5-2 and
miR-US22 target components of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway downstream of EGFR critical for viral
reactivation and attenuate US28- and UL138-mediated signaling.
We have identified RhoA as a target of HCMV miR-US25-1 that plays a key role in regulating the proliferation of
latently-infected CD34+ HPCs through modulating cytokinesis. Intriguingly, HCMV US28 (Project 3) activates
RhoA through ligand-dependent signaling and recent proximity labelling experiments identified RhoGEFs and
Rho GTPases as components of the US28 signalosome. Mutation of US28 or chemical inhibition of RhoA
reduces viral reactivation, highlighting the importance of US28 and Rho signaling in the reactivation process.
Additionally, UL8 (Project 4) is essential for reactivation and activates Rho signaling through the Wnt pathway.
Moreover, proximity labelling experiments identified Wnt and Rho pathway components as part of the UL8
signalosome. We have identified additional HCMV miRNAs that target key components of the Wnt and Rho
GTPase pathways including the Wnt effector DVL2, RhoGEFs, the GTPase CDC42 and downstream effector
proteins, indicating that Rho GTPase signaling is intricately regulated by viral miRNAs in addition to being
stimulated by viral proteins. We hypothesize that HCMV miRNAs target components of the MEK/ERK pathway
to downregulate virus-mediated signaling at the time of reactivation, whereas miRNAs expressed during latency
target components of the Rho GTPase pathways to oppose the effects of virus-mediated signaling to maintain
the virus in latency."
10899432,"SUMMARY - PROJECT 3
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a b-herpesvirus infecting 44-100% of the population and remains a
significant cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant (SOT) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem
cell transplant (SCT) recipients. Infection in SCT patients is often associated with myelosuppression and graft
failure due to virus reactivation from latency, but the associated mechanisms are still largely unknown. HCMV
encodes multiple latency-associated gene products including the chemokine receptor US28, which binds CC-
chemokines as well as the CX3C-chemokine Fractalkine. We have demonstrated that US28 ligand-dependent
signaling is required to maintain viral latency in vitro in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and in vivo
in humanized mice. US28 was required in both systems for reactivation of latent HCMV and promotes CD34+
HPC differentiation into myeloid lineage cells, indicating that US28 plays a dynamic role in both processes. While
we have identified that ligand binding activity for US28 is required for HCMV latency, we do not yet know whether
this effect is ligand-specific. In addition, we have recently demonstrated that HCMV-encoded chemokine ligands
modulate US28 signaling. We hypothesize that both the host CC chemokines and viral chemokines
UL146/UL147 promote latency by activating specific signaling pathways while other US28 ligands help direct
reactivation by modifying signaling. We hypothesize that US28 ligand binding activity (ligand-specific) is required
to maintain latency by interfacing with EGFR signaling and during reactivation US28 antagonizes EGFR signaling
and shifts to activating RhoA pathways to enhance productive replication. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine
which US28 ligands reprogram cells during latency and reactivation using neutralizing antibodies against host
and viral chemokines, viral mutants that impact the ability of US28 to selectively bind ligands, and viral mutants
lacking the viral chemokines. In SA2, we will utilize our US28 interactome data generated using the BirA-Turbo
proximity sensor technology to identify signaling factors that play a role in latency and reactivation. Through
mutational analyses we have identified specific regions of US28, in the C’terminal tail and intracellular loop 3
domains, that modify US28 signaling. We will determine what effect these mutations have on both the US28
interactome and latency and reactivation using in vitro and in vivo models. Lastly, in SA3, we will define how
US28 signaling influences other HCMV proteins (Projects 1 and 4) and miRNAs (Project 2) with specific focus
on how US28 intersects with the EGFR pathway, to contribute to the combined HCMV-manipulation of EGFR
signaling (Project 5) and therefore control of latency and reactivation within the overarching goals of this
proposal. Results of this study will generate new virus latency and reactivation paradigms promoting the
development of novel therapies to prevent virus reactivation."
10899436,"SUMMARY – PROJECT 5
 Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after hematopoietic
stem cell transplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplant (SOT) due to reactivation or a new infection in these
transplant recipients. Our combined PPG laboratories have shown that HCMV infection of CD34+ hematopoietic
progenitor cells (HPCs) the site of HCMV latency and subsequent reactivation alters hematopoietic events to
favor HPC differentiation towards the myeloid lineage. To fully understand HCMV reactivation process, we need
not only understand the process of how reactivating virus in CD34+ HPC directs differentiation towards the
myeloid lineage, but also mechanistically how HCMV reactivation in monocytes directs signaling to
promote differentiation towards productive macrophages.
 Through our collaborative program, we have identified viral genes (e.g., UL135, US28, UL7/8) and
miRNAs (e.g. miR-US22) that are required for reactivation. Furthermore, through the use of deletion mutant
viruses that fail to reactivate, we have identified the existence of blockades to HCMV reactivation that are
associated with differentiation into macrophages. The signaling events important for reactivation of latent virus
in tissue macrophages remains poorly understood. We suggest temporally unique roles for UL135, US28
and UL7/8 and a unique intersection of these gene products with HCMV miRNAs expressed during
latency in usurping the signaling necessary to promote reactivation in this essential cell type. We
hypothesize distinct signaling events in monocyte to macrophage differentiation relieve blockades to reactivation
and these reactivation events are specifically driven by modifications to cellular signaling by the combined effort
of these viral factors. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following aims. Specific Aim 1. Defining signaling
networks for HCMV latency and reactivation in monocytes and macrophages. We hypothesize that functionally
distinct host cell responses in monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation are essential for reactivation. Specific
Aim 2. Determine checkpoint blockades for viruses that fail to reactivate. We hypothesize that a failure in specific
cellular signaling reprogramming during reactivation will result in a cell that phenotypically is unable to support
viral replication. Specific Aim 3. Define the signaling nodes modulated by infection for reactivation in
monocytes/macrophages. We hypothesize that the EGFR and RhoA signaling pathways are critical for HCMV
latency and reactivation in macrophages.
 IMPACT: These proposed aims will allow us to gain greater insight and as we integrate our collective
work, we hope to translate the results into novel molecular signatures designed to improve the outcome of an
infection that remains a significant problem in transplant recipients."
10899486,"PROJECT SUMMARY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Administrative Core provides the leadership and governance to maximize the impact of the highly
successful UCSF-Bay Area CFAR, one of the original CFARs funded by NIAID in 1988. We note the
publication of 701 papers citing the CFAR in the past 4 years and the securing of over $400 million in
HIV-related NIH funding across our CFAR. The former leadership led a productive CFAR and a thoughtful
succession process to new leadership in 2019. New leadership then strategically reconfigured the CFAR
by introducing new components and enhancing existing ones to expand our reach. Of the 151 projects
on our funded research base, CFAR provided direct service to 52 (34%) and was connected to 133 (88%).
With our expanded initiatives in the reconfigured UCSF Bay Area CFAR, we increase direct services to 96
(64%) projects, with 142 (94%) receiving support. The Administrative Core propels new multidisciplinary
research, ensures community engagement and health equity, and furthers scientific exchange.
 Informed by robust strategic planning and program evaluation processes, the Core will organize and
oversee all CFAR components to ensure that the CFAR is responsive to the needs of our research community
while continuing sound fiscal management of Center resources. Moreover, the Administrative Core will
ensure focus of the CFAR on our three cross cutting areas of health equity and community
engagement, training, and international research via four aims: 1) Convening a collaborative CFAR
community by providing opportunities for productive scientific exchanges, maintaining bidirectional
communications between CFAR leadership and members, and promoting internal and external collaborations;
2) Providing effective and responsible institutional leadership to leverage CFAR and institutional resources by
connecting CFAR investigators to CFAR/institutional resources and HIV research opportunities, securing input
from internal and external advisory sources to improve the CFAR, and repositioning CFAR resources as
needed; 3) Engaging the communities we serve to inform CFAR activities and extend its impact by enhancing
our collaborations with local health departments and Getting to Zero consortia in San Francisco and the East
Bay, hosting our annual Bay Area Health Disparities Symposium, supporting collaborations with local
community-based organizations, and co-organizing our joint Community Advisory Board; and 4) Monitoring
and evaluating the success of CFAR programs to drive effective strategic planning and decision making by
continuing rigorous financial/regulatory management, ensuring that CFAR activities are responsive to the
Office of AIDS Research HIV priorities, convening our Core Management Committee, and measuring the
success of Scientific and Developmental Cores, programs and the Scientific Working Groups."
10899488,"DEVELOPMENTAL CORE PROJECT SUMMARY
The mission of the UCSF-Bay Area CFAR is to promote multi-disciplinary HIV research, and the
Developmental Core plays a central role. The Core is the principal vehicle CFAR uses to support investigators
across the CFAR, with a particular focus on early stage investigators (ESI) and investigators from
underrepresented minority (URM) backgrounds. From 2011-2021, CFAR funded 170 pilot awards for a total of
$8.64M, resulting in $156M in follow-on funding from NIH, a 17-fold return on investment. These 170 awards
yielded 525 resultant publications, 17 K-level awards, 15 R21s, 27 R01s and 20 other NIH awards. Of 23
supplements awarded in the last decade, totaling $3.8M, NIH funding was $82.2 million, a 21 times return on
investment. Since our last renewal, the Core has mentored 87 early stage investigators (ESIs) in its formal
Mentoring Program; launched the first CFAR-sponsored Mentoring group to support URM ESIs in HIV
Research; trained 156 researchers in our innovative “Mentoring the Mentors” program on techniques of
effective mentoring focused on diverse mentees (226 since the inception of the workshop in 2012); and
completed a long-term evaluation of both the local mentoring program and the national Mentoring the Mentors
program. During this project period, CFAR funded 72 awards (2 co-funded) in a direct costs amount of $3.1M.
 Going forward, the Developmental Core will advance its dedicated commitment to supporting emerging
leaders in HIV research with a heightened focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion through a comprehensive
set of activities centered on four specific aims: (1) to sustain and refine a comprehensive two-year mentoring
program for early career HIV investigators, providing each with access to the tools needed for future success in
research. This CFAR Mentoring Program pairs mentees with senior CFAR mentors, provides monthly career
developmental workshops, hosts a yearly symposium with Excellence awards, provides a yearly leadership
retreat, and provides specific aims reviews before each grant deadline; (2) to conduct annual “Mentoring the
Mentors” workshops to train HIV researchers from CFARs around the U.S. in tools and techniques of
mentoring with a special emphasis on nurturing diversity. We have also traveled to other CFARs to provide this
Mentoring the Mentors workshop and provided programs on mentoring programs for URM trainees in other
forums; (3) to support innovative research and the development of ESIs through four different types of peer-
reviewed awards; and (4) to advocate for and support URM investigators in navigating barriers in academia,
and provide them with key career, mentoring, and professional development support, including forming the first
inter-CFAR working group for URM investigators. Therefore, the revised and expanded Developmental Core
of the UCSF-Bay Area CFAR will continue to be at the center of driving innovation in HIV research locally,
nationally, and globally."
10899490,"PROJECT SUMMARY FOR CLINICAL CORE
The UCSF Bay Area CFAR has a long history of supporting and accelerating clinically impactful HIV research,
which ultimately requires direct investigation of those living with HIV and at-risk human populations. The
SCOPE cohort was a major innovation and direct consequence of CFAR investment that has had a profound
impact on basic and translational HIV research conducted not just at UCSF, but around the world. Since 2017,
the Clinical & Population Sciences Core (now restructured into the CFAR Clinical Core) contributed to 216
peer-reviewed publications, provided mentoring and training to 57 early-stage investigators (ESIs), and
supported a total of 361 NIH-funded projects (supporting 338 unique core users). The revamped Clinical Core
of the UCSF Bay Area CFAR now contains three components: the SCOPE Cohort, a new Participant Referral
Service designed to increase the diversity of participants in the SCOPE cohort and other CFAR investigator-
initiated studies; and the Specimen Processing and Banking Sub-Core or AIDS Specimen Bank. Over the past
40 years, the AIDS Specimen Bank (ASB) has provided the unique expertise and infrastructure to support the
processing and storage of biospecimens in the areas of host-viral interactions, microbiome, HIV transmission,
treatment, prevention, and pathogenesis of HIV. Over this past project period, the ASB processed more than
94,000 specimens and distributed 12,100 specimens, contributing to multiple projects.
 In the next funding cycle, we will continue to leverage and amplify the impact of the existing SCOPE
cohort to expand multidisciplinary human subject research and increase its integration with the CFAR Network
of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). We will also initiate a novel program called the Participant Referral
Service to recruit additional participants – including those from communities disproportionately impacted by
HIV but underrepresented in participating in research – from the diverse Ward 86 HIV clinic at San Francisco
General Hospital. Ward 86 patients are racially/ethnically diverse (45% white, 17% African American, 27%
Latinx, 6.3% Asian, 12% multi-racial), socioeconomically challenged, and have high rates of marginal housing
(33%). Therefore, recruiting Ward 86 patients into CFAR studies will serve our cross-cutting priority of health
equity. Moreover, we will move the ASB, supported by the CFAR, into the Clinical Core given its critical
function in storing and curating specimens in the SCOPE cohort. By providing access to a well-characterized
cohort for human subjects data and specimens (SCOPE), as well as platforms from which to diversity
participants in human subjects research supported by the CFAR, the Clinical Core will help launch the careers
of early stage investigators (ESIs), especially those from groups underrepresented in HIV research. The
Clinical Core is well integrated with the other CFAR Cores, especially the Basic and Translational Core, and
will serve as an effective Core to facilitate timely cost-efficient investigation of emerging questions in HIV."
10899492,"PROJECT SUMMARY FOR BASIC AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE CORE
The Basic and Translational Science Core is the major scientific core supporting the breadth of basic and
translational research across the UCSF-Bay Area Center for AIDS Research (CFAR). This new encompassing
Core is a product of our strategic planning process, which involved soliciting input from key stakeholders in the
CFAR community. The Core consists of two continued and enhanced Sub-Cores including Immunology and
Functional Genomics (formerly the Immunology Core) and Pharmacology of Cure and Pathogenesis (formerly
the Pharmacology Core) as well as a new Bioinformatics Sub-Core. The Immunology and Functional
Genomics Core broadens the focus of the prior flow cytometry-based Immunology core by adding both high-
dimensional spectral flow cytometry and scRNAseq support. The Pharmacology of Cure and Pathogenesis
core focuses pharmacology support on the needs of CFAR investigators for pharmacokinetic (PK) and
pharmacodynamic (PD) studies for studies of putative cure interventions. The Sub-Core also provides tissue
drug levels, and measurement of drugs and metabolites relevant to pathogenesis and co-morbidities. This
enhanced focus complements the Biomarkers of Behavior Program in the Bio-behavioral Core, which
measures antiretroviral drug levels for adherence research. Given the consistent need expressed by basic and
translational investigators during our strategic planning process for bioinformatics support, we have also added
a new Bioinformatics Sub-Core in the Basic and Translational Core to support investigators in computational
high-dimensional data processing, analysis, visualization, and management of multi-omics data. Each one of
our Sub-Cores is integrated not just administratively, but also functionally connected through well-attended bi-
weekly “SCOPTIONS” (an interest group focused on HIV cure and inflammation) and monthly “Multi-Omics”

Although hydrogel-based materials constitute a multibillion-dollar market, commercial applications for drug
delivery and regenerative medicine are extremely limited. Hydrogels have garnered intense interest as
extracellular matrix (ECM) mimics due to their tailorable permeability, mechanics, and degradability, yet their
clinical use in this area largely depends on biological materials such as proteins. Although some success has
been met with naturally-derived ECM, these naturally derived materials are often limited by long regulatory
approval timelines due to the potential to react with other biologics. Synthetic materials are therefore attractive
due to their known chemical compositions, but the challenge with their use lies in the lack of complexity as
compared to biological systems, which translates to a lack of efficacy in the clinic. Hence, the goal of this
proposal, and of our research lab, is to expand the toolbox for building complexity and functionality into
synthetic hydrogel biomaterials by using dynamic chemistries and monomer sequence-based
strategies. This strategy takes much inspiration from nature, as the structure and function of biological polymers
arise from the precise placement of their amino acids or nucleotides. In addition, cells are able to remodel and
reconfigure the natural ECM over time. Both of these characteristics have proven difficult to engineer into
synthetic networks. Hence, our goals over the next five years are to 1) develop hydrogels with reversible
crosslinks to quantitatively design reconfigurable matrices, 2) develop synthetic sequence-controlled linkers to
control hydrogel properties (e.g., mechanics, degradation, activity) using polypeptoids, and 3) combine these
approaches to develop self-assembled constructs for tissue engineering. We believe our goals will be useful for
broad applications in regenerative medicine, therapeutic delivery, and preclinical models of tissue for drug
development. In addition, we anticipate that the potential to alter current modes of thinking in hydrogel and
biomaterial design is high, and that our work will shed insight to the biological processes underlying cell-matrix
interactions. For these reasons, this work is well suited for the R35 Maximizing Investigators' Research Award
for Early Stage Investigators."
10899666,"The ‘actin cytoskeleton’ is not one structure but a number of distinct structures assembled and disassembled for
different purposes. In mammalian cells, a few abundant and easily recognizable structures dominate our view
of the actin cytoskeleton, including: stress fibers, lamellipodia and filopodia. However, a growing number of less
abundant and/or highly transient actin-based structures have been revealed, controlling important cellular
processes. Two such actin structures are the subject of this application: 1) CIA, calcium-induced actin; and 2)
ADA, acute depolarization-induced actin. Though highly transient, both structures are extensive in the cytosol
and affect important processes. In addition, both CIA and ADA impact the structure and function of mitochondria.
CIA depends on calcium activation of the formin protein INF2, which stimulates actin polymerization on the
endoplasmic reticulum and throughout the cytosol. Downstream effects of CIA include increased mitochondrial
calcium and increased mitochondrial fission. The importance of CIA is illustrated by the fact that INF2 mutations
link to two diseases, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTD).
ADA is triggered by mitochondrial depolarization (either pharmacologically-induced or hypoxia-induced), which
activates two parallel pathways: 1) mitochondrial calcium release activates protein kinase C-, activating in turn
Rac, WAVE complex, and Arp2/3 complex; and 2) decreased ATP activates AMP-dependent protein kinase
(AMPK) through LKB1, activating in turn Cdc42 and FMNL formins. The ADA actin network is tightly associated
with mitochondria. An exciting new result is that one immediate consequence of ADA is rapid stimulation of
glycolysis. Additionally, ADA temporarily inhibits longer-term consequences of mitochondrial depolarization such
as mitochondrial reorganization and recruitment of the mitophagy protein Parkin. The goals in this grant period
are to elucidate both the mechanisms triggering CIA and ADA, as well as their downstream effects. These goals
will be accomplished using a combination of cellular approaches (live-cell microscopy, proteomics, metabolic
analysis) and biochemical approaches (cell-free reconstitution, analysis of purified proteins on model lipid
membranes). The questions to be asked include the following. 1) How is INF2 activated by increased calcium?
2) How are INF2-polymerized filaments organized into a network by myosin II and fascin? 3) How does CIA
interface with known mitochondrial fission proteins such as Mff and Drp1 to stimulate fission? 4) How do PKC
and AMPK activate Rac and Cdc42, respectively, during ADA? 5) How do Arp2/3 complex and FMNL formins
work together during ADA? 6) How does ADA stimulate glycolysis? These questions address fundamental
mechanistic questions important to a wide range of mammalian cells, and occupy an exciting frontier between
cytoskeletal biology, mitochondrial biology, and metabolism.

Primary liver cancer, the vast majority of which is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the few cancers with
increasing incidence in the US. Incidence of HCC has tripled since 1980, which is particularly worrisome given
that HCC confers a median survival of less than two years. The steepest increases in incidence are in Southern
rural states and among ethnic minorities. While the prevalence of HCC had paralleled high rates of viral hepatitis
in the last several decades, recent increases in the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and
its progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with fibrosis and cirrhosis, has fueled HCC in recent years.
Yet, these factors alone do not explain the substantial regional and ethnic variation in HCC progression. One
understudied but potentially potent HCC risk factor with increasing prevalence that disproportionately affects
ethnic minorities, is exposure to environmental contaminants. These contaminants degrade slowly and therefore
persist in the environment, providing a stable exogenous source for human exposure. Toxic metal(oid)s such as
cadmium and arsenic are classified as probable carcinogens, and emerging data from murine models suggest
that exposure is associated with hepatic steatosis, cirrhosis and liver cancer. Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl
substances (PFAS) exposure in humans is associated with obesity and NASH. Further, emerging evidence
indicates that these environmental exposures can induce epigenetic alterations that may promote adverse
effects on the liver, but we lack longitudinal human data. These data underscore the need for longitudinal human
data to assess whether and how these contaminants impact HCC risk. To address these knowledge gaps, and
in response to RFA-CA-20-049, we propose the Southern Liver Health Study, a longitudinal cohort study of two
sub-cohorts comprising 16,000 males and females aged 40 years and older in two Southeastern states, North
Carolina and Georgia. We will test the overarching hypothesis that cadmium alone or in a mixture with other
toxic metals and PFAS increases the risk of progression from NAFLD to liver fibrosis and HCC. The cohort will
be recruited from community clinics including Federally Qualified Health Centers and University Health Systems’
Primary Care Centers and Hepatology programs at Duke, UNC Chapel Hill and Emory. Sub-cohort I will comprise
10,000 otherwise healthy adults who will be followed for 1–5 years, anticipating that ~800 fibrosis cases,
including cirrhosis, will develop, and sub-cohort II will comprise 6,000 advanced fibrosis cases, anticipating ~750
HCC cases will develop. We will nest case-control studies within the cohorts, evaluate associations between
environmental exposures and HCC incidence, and identify epigenetic marks responsive to contaminants that
predict progression to HCC. Impact: This will be the first large-scale effort to longitudinally determine the link
between environmental contaminants, liver disease and cancer in a residentially and ethnically diverse
population. Additionally, we will create a data and specimen repository that will provide the research community
with an invaluable resource to study HCC and other cancers."

Adolescent mental health has been declared a national emergency, and disparities exist among sexual and
ethnic minority adolescent sub-groups. Specifically, Hispanic sexual minority youth (HSMY) bear a
disproportionate burden of depressive symptoms compared to their non-Hispanic white, heterosexual
counterparts. While this health disparity is partly attributed to the marginalization experienced by HSMY on behalf
of their intersecting minority identities, little research has been done to understand the mechanisms through
which other culturally-relevant, multi-level factors may also contribute to the high rates of depressive symptoms
in this population. In an effort to highlight points of intervention to confront these disparities and the ongoing
national emergency, this proposal will explore how multi-level factors, such as the intergenerational effect of
caregiver childhood trauma (operationalized as adverse childhood experiences[ACEs]), caregiver-HSMY
acculturation differences, and caregiver-HSMY communication quality, may affect HSMY depressive symptoms.
Guided by ecodevelopmental theory, I will harmonize existing longitudinal datasets consisting of caregiver-HSMY
dyads and collect rich qualitative data from HSMY to accomplish two specific aims: 1) Examine whether a) an
intergenerational direct effect of caregiver ACEs on HSMY depressive symptoms is b) mediated by caregiver-
HSMY communication quality and c) if this indirect pathway is moderated by a discrepancy between caregiver
and HSMY Americanism (a subtype of acculturation); and 2) use ecodevelopmental theory to investigate
potential drivers of HSMY depressive symptoms. The accompanying training plan will provide the foundation
for me to a) advance my knowledge in intergenerational effects of childhood trauma and its implications for
intervention development in Hispanic youth, b) develop advanced skills in longitudinal analyses and data
harmonization; c) develop advanced skills in qualitative analysis, and d) enhance my skills in interdisciplinary
team science and professional development. I have a strong and highly successful mentorship team dedicated
to my growth and development to guide me throughout this award. Together, the research and training proposal
will support my development as an independent nurse scientist in the area of HSMY mental health. This NRSA
F31 proposal aligns with the NINR’s Strategic Plan with its focus on understanding drivers of mental health
disparities in adolescents and families with shared characteristics. The proposed study will generate important
knowledge related to the intergenerational effect of caregiver childhood trauma on HSMY mental health and
examine a mechanism (i.e., caregiver-HSMY communication quality) through which this effect may exist. The
findings stand to inform whether culturally-tailored, family-based interventions aimed at advancing HSMY mental
health equity should target caregiver-HSMY communication quality and incorporate trauma-informed care."
10901104,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are strongly associated with cardiometabolic and mental health
outcomes in adulthood. Mechanisms of this relationship are thought to be varied, including both behavioral and
physiological pathways. Similarly, intergenerational trauma (IT), has also been linked to adverse cardiovascular
health (CVH) and mental health outcomes through both behavioral and physiological pathways. Both ACEs and
IT are prevalent in Hispanic populations, factors associated with IT (e.g., colonization, militarization, victimization)
are especially prevalent at the US-Mexico border, and Hispanic populations are disproportionately impacted by
other social determinants of health such as psychosocial stress and socioeconomic disadvantage and may be
at higher risk for poor CVH outcomes. However, prevalence of ACEs/IT, factors associated with IT, and
mechanisms linking ACEs/IT to CVH at the US-Mexico border remains understudied. Understanding these
relationships would address a critical gap in the literature and potentially elucidate intervention strategies towards
eventually reducing or eliminating CVH disparities at the US-Mexico border. The proposed study will investigate
the role of ACEs/IT in relation to CVH and risk factors in a unique, understudied population using comprehensive,
validated approaches. It is hypothesized that presence of ACEs and/or IT is associated with worse CVH, and
that the relationship is impacted by social, behavioral, and physiologic risk factors. The study aims to determine
the relationship between ACEs/IT and CVH components (Research Aim 1), establish the relationship between
ACEs/IT and risk factors (acculturation, psychosocial stress, socioeconomics, and/or neurocognitive factors)
(Research Aim 2), and evaluate the role of proposed risk factors in the relationship between ACEs/IT and CVH
among Hispanic adults of Mexican descent living at the US-Mexico border. The proposed study will examine
n=50 Hispanic adults of Mexican descent living at the US-Mexico border who are recruited for the sponsor’s
Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health
and Sleep (NoCHeS) study. The study will use validated questionnaires to measure ACEs and IT. CVH will be
assessed utilizing the newly released Life’s Essential 8 (LE8) metric by the American Heart Association (AHA).
All metric components will be measured using standard, objective, and self-report measures in a clinic visit and
at home. Additionally, potential behavioral and physiologic mechanisms will be explored, including acculturation,
psychosocial stress (stress and social support), socioeconomics, and neurocognitive factors (processing speed,
executive function, working memory, inhibitory control). Findings will increase understanding of the relationship
between ACEs, IT, CVH and risk factors in this population. Finally, this study will serve as a foundation for future
translational research aimed at prevention and intervention strategies for potentially modifiable risk factors in
CVH and will provide the applicant with necessary training to further pursue community-engaged, independent
research focused on reducing health disparities and improving health through practical, data-driven solutions."
10901194,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Real-life decisions are often context-dependent. For example, a motorist may decide to slow down at a
yellow traffic light if a police car is nearby or accelerate if the intersection is empty. The ability to use contextual
information to flexibly guide decisions is a critical component of higher-order cognition that is often impaired in
psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia. To facilitate the identification of potential therapies for these
disorders, scientists have investigated the brain bases of context-dependent decision-making in humans and
animal models. Whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in humans have identified
areas in the frontal and parietal cortices that appear to maintain contextual information so it can be used to
guide subsequent decisions. However, fMRI alone cannot reveal the causal and cellular-level roles of these
areas in context-dependent decision-making, and this level of understanding is critical for the development of
novel therapeutics. As such, studying the neurobiology of context maintenance and other higher-order
cognitive processes in mice will be crucial for guiding research on new therapies for human disorders.
However, it is still unclear (1) what areas across the mouse brain contribute to the maintenance of contextual
information and (2) how activity in these areas shapes activity in decision-making regions and behavior. The
aims of this proposal leverage the global coverage of fMRI and the extensive genetic toolkit available in mice to
answer these questions. Aim 1 uses a novel platform for behaving mouse fMRI to image mice as they
complete a task that requires them to maintain contextual information in order to receive rewards. Comparing
brain activity during this task to activity in a nearly identical task that does not rely on contextual information will
identify areas that are involved in the maintenance of contextual information across the brain. Aim 2 uses
optogenetics and two-photon microscopy to silence activity in one of these potential context maintenance
areas to determine how it causally contributes to cellular-level activity in a decision-making area and task
performance. Together, these experiments will unveil new neural substrates of context-dependent decision-
making and suggest potential treatment targets for future pre-clinical studies of psychiatric illness.
 This proposal was tailored to both exploit my existing expertise in whole-brain imaging and facilitate my
acquisition of new technical skills and professional competencies that will advance me towards my goal of
becoming an independent physician-scientist. Dr. Michael Shadlen, an expert in perceptual decision-making,
and Dr. Itamar Kahn, an expert in behaving mouse fMRI, are the ideal pair of sponsors for this project, and the
vibrant scientific and clinical communities at Columbia make this the ideal place for me to pursue this training."
10901266,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF) complexes represent a diverse family of ATP-dependent chromatin
remodeling complexes (CRCs) that play critical roles in the modulation of chromatin accessibility and gene
expression. mSWI/SNF complexes are combinatorically assembled from 29 different gene products to generate
three distinct 11-15-subunit classes termed BAF, pBAF, and ncBAF complexes. Importantly, mSWI/SNF genes
are mutated in over 20% of human cancers and several neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), in several cases
representing causative genomic abnormalities. While biochemical, structural, and genomics-based studies have
begun to define subunit-specific contributions to overall mSWI/SNF complex function, the specific roles for DNA-
binding and histone reader domains present on subunits remain largely unassigned. In particular, the functional
contributions of sequence-non-specific DNA-binding domains, including the winged-helix (WH) domain of
SMARCB1, the high-mobility group (HMG) domain of SMARCE1, and the ARID domain of ARID1A/B subunits,
have not been identified and represent key ‘hubs’ of frequent single-residue mutations in human cancer and
NDDs. I aim to define the role for these domains in mSWI/SNF complex function in vitro and in the human cell
context via the assessment of disease-associated perturbations.
During this F31 fellowship, I will determine the roles for sequence-non-specific DNA-binding domains in a) proper
mSWI/SNF complex assembly and biochemical integrity; b) mSWISNF complex catalytic (ATPase) activity and
nucleosome remodeling; and c) for genome-wide mSWI/SNF targeting and DNA accessibility generation in
human cell line model systems. I will accomplish this by generating wild-type (WT) and DNA-binding-deficient
disease-associated mutant variants of mSWI/SNF complexes and evaluating their biochemical assembly,
stoichiometry, and catalytic and nucleosome remodeling functions. Further, I aim to determine the impact of
DNA-binding domain perturbations on mSWI/SNF complex genomic targeting, DNA accessibility generation, and
subsequent gene expression in human cell contexts.
This research will elucidate key features of DNA-binding domain-mediated SWI/SNF complex assembly,
integrity, activities, and chromatin localization, linking these functions to resulting DNA accessibility and gene
expression programs in human cells in normal and disease states. The mechanisms governing chromatin
remodeling complex activities during basic cellular processes and in human disease remain incompletely
understood, and with the highly frequent mutations in these processes observed in human cancers and
neurodevelopmental conditions, such studies are uniquely pertinent and represent a high-impact priority for the
field at-large."

Lynch syndrome (LS) affects ~1.2 million Americans and predisposes them to colorectal cancer (CRC) and other 
malignancies. LS normal cells acquire somatic second mutations and become DNA mismatch repair deficient 
(MMRD). MMRD tumors have exceptionally high numbers of frameshift proteins. MMRD mutation rates are so 
elevated that precisely the same recurrent mutations are “shared” among tumors from different patients. For 
example, TGFBR2 has a 10bp adenine repeat that, when mutated, causes the identical frameshift protein (FSP) 
in ~80% of MMRD CRCs. Previously, we showed that (a) 100% of MMRD CRC patients have CD8+ T cells 
reactive against MMRD rFSPs, (b) performed first-in-human trials showing that peptide vaccination robustly 
upregulates T-cell immunity against rFSP in advanced MMRD cancer patients, and (c) demonstrated functionally 
in LS mouse models that vaccination with only four mouse recurrent neoantigens increases CD8+ killer and 
CD4+ helper T-cell immune response, reduces CRC burden and prolongs cancer-free survival. As new 
preliminary data, we and CAP-IT CRI Computational Tumor Immunology Core (CTIC) Co-PI Getz, a primary 
architect of NCI tumor genome atlases, have (a) sequenced the largest number of LS colorectal adenomas and 
adenocarcinomas worldwide and identified many promising MMRD recurrent neoantigen vaccine candidates, 
(b) used MMRD CRC cell lines, LS patient colon adenoma derived tumoroids and the NCI CPTAC tumor atlas 
to confirm that recurrent neoantigens are bona fide expressed as neo-peptides in tumors and (c) showed that in 
mice, lipo-nanoparticle RNA (LNP-RNA) rFSP vaccination is significantly more immunogenic than peptide 
vaccination. Here we propose to test the hypothesis that LNP-RNA rFSP vaccination elicits LS mouse 
CD8+/CD4+ immune response, reduces tumor burden, increases survival (AIM 1), and delineates the most 
immunogenic cytotoxic Lynch syndrome patient recurrent neoantigens (AIM 2). This project will identify the most 
immunogenic recurrent neoantigens for NCI PREVENT pre-IND vaccine development and NCI CP-NET LS 
immunoprevention clinical trials. Importantly, our studies will provide vital mechanistic insights into future 
generations of effective patient LNP RNA immunoprevention vaccines."
10906214,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Computerized chest tomography (CT) lung cancer screening programs have increased the detection of 
premalignant non-solid (NS) nodules that harbor preinvasive or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma. Given that 
NS nodules can progress to invasive adenocarcinoma (solid nodules), intercepting progression is considered an 
urgent clinical priority. However, the cellular and molecular alterations that accompany disease progression are
poorly understood. NS nodules exhibit lower rates of HLA deletions than invasive/metastatic lung cancer, and 
our integrated clinical and preclinical investigations have recently uncovered T cell-enriched immune 
microenvironments, including elevated activated T regs in NS nodules. Global genomic analysis of NS nodules 
identified high tumor-associated antigen (TAA) XAGE-1b and several HLA-restricted neoantigens. These 
findings have led to the hypothesis that RNA-based vaccination against NS nodule-associated antigens and or 
neoantigens can drive activation of T helper and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells while reducing tumor-infiltrating Tregs to 
impair NS nodule progression to invasive adenocarcinoma.
We will test this hypothesis through two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine the potential of lipo-nanoparticle 
RNA (LNP RNA) XAGE-1b vaccination in intercepting NS nodule progression in preclinical syngeneic models of 
NSCLC. A state-of-the-art LNP-XAGE-1b RNA vaccine will be manufactured and optimized in collaboration with 
the LNP-RNA shared resource facility. A novel physiologically relevant mouse model recapitulating the 
progression of human NS nodules will be used to determine the efficacy of the XAGE-1b vaccine in intercepting 
the progression of NSN to invasive carcinoma. Mechanisms associated with LNP RNA vaccine immune 
interception will be elucidated with comprehensive immune profiling approaches. Aim 2 will delineate the most 
immunogenic and cytotoxic patient lung NS nodule antigens and neoantigens identified in a multi-ethnic cohort
of clinically annotated NS nodules for vaccine payloads. Human class I MHC (HLA) transgenic mice will identify
the most immunogenic lung NSN vaccine cargo in vivo. Patient-specific tumoroid/autologous T-cell cocultures 
and immunopeptidomics will be used to confirm immunogenicity and antigenic presentation on autologous 
patient HLA. Finally, the cytotoxic potential of NS nodule patient neoantigen-specific T-cells against autologous 
tumoroids will be used to rank neoantigens.
We expect to delineate the most immunogenic vaccine cargo together with informative correlative studies for 
NCI PREVENT pre-IND vaccine development and NCI CP-NET LS immunoprevention clinical trials and provide 
critical mechanistic insights into effective patient LNP RNA immune interception vaccines."
10902655,"Project Summary/Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease and its related dementias (ADRD) are associated with high rates of neuronal death in
affected areas, but little is known about the ability of the brain to recover following therapeutic intervention.
ADRD are characterized by protein deposits consisting of beta-Amyloid peptide and microtubule-associated
protein tau. Tau pathology develops independently of beta-Amyloid deposits, and removal of beta-Amyloid
alone is not sufficient to reduce cognitive decline in mice. The dysfunction of tau is characterized by an
abnormal state of hyper-phosphorylation (P-tau), induced via a plethora of kinase pathways. This P-tau
disrupts cellular function by sequestering other microtubule-associated proteins, directly destabilizing
microtubules, and binding normal tau to form paired helical filaments (PHF-tau). Turnover of the tau protein is
decreased in this pathology, as PHF-tau is resistant to neuronal proteases and degradation by ubiquitination.
In vitro dephosphorylation of P-tau by the phosphoprotein phosphatase PP2A induces dissociation of PHF-tau
and restores susceptibility of tau to protease digestion. PP2A activity and expression is diminished in neurons
exhibiting P-tau pathology. Preliminary data from our lab indicate that direct delivery of PP2A DNA to the
dorsal raphe nucleus (an early presenter of tau pathology) is sufficient to decrease P-tau in ADRD-model mice.
To date, no studies have used targeted reversal of tau pathology at different disease-progression stages to
investigate ADRD treatment outcomes. This proposal will investigate the reversal of P-tau pathology in
serotonergic neurons, to determine any rescue of function or mitigation of P-tau propagation. These findings
will further the understanding of early Alzheimer’s Disease, and may identify a clinically-relevant therapeutic
intervention. Additionally, this fellowship training plan gives high priority to the professional development and
research training of the fellowship recipient. This research training will take place in a highly collaborative and
interdisciplinary laboratory setting within the University of Iowa’s department of Neuroscience and
Pharmacology."
10902656,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 The proposed research plan will offer critical insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that
drive the pathogenesis of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). One prominent feature of DM1 is debilitating,
progressive skeletal muscle weakness, for which there is no cure or effective treatment. Skeletal muscles
from patients with DM1 exhibit abnormalities in alternative splicing, a post-transcriptional mechanism that
enables one gene to produce two or more protein isoforms. As a result, many protein isoforms are
inappropriately expressed in DM1 muscles. The alternative splicing of the clathrin heavy chain (Cltc) gene
is mis-regulated in skeletal muscles from DM1 patients, resulting in aberrant protein isoform expression
during postnatal development and adulthood. Cltc mis-splicing reduces muscle contractile function in mice.
CLTC is the main player in clathrin mediated endocytosis, yet also serves as a scaffold for cytoskeletal and
endosomal components. The objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms by which the mis-
regulation of Cltc splicing during development causes muscle weakness. The overall hypothesis is that Cltc
mis-splicing, which blocks the inclusion of a 21-nucleotide micro exon during postnatal development,
prevents protein scaffolding events that are critical for neonatal muscles to mature into muscles capable of
supporting adult contractile needs. Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms by which Cltc mis-splicing disrupts
the formation of transverse tubules, structures that are required for contraction and are abnormal in DM1
muscles. Aim 2 will define how Cltc splicing regulates the endo-lysosomal trafficking of ubiquitinated
proteins, which is responsible for the downregulation of ion channels and membrane receptors. Aim 3 will
determine the functional impact of Cltc mis-splicing on skeletal muscles with different cell type compositions;
the pathology of DM1 and other muscle diseases is often cell type specific. Together, these studies will
expand our understanding of the role alternative splicing plays in muscle health and disease. One exciting
possibility is that Cltc mis-splicing could be redirected by antisense oligonucleotides to treat DM1.
 These studies will provide outstanding training for the applicant, whose long-term goal is to lead an
academic research team. Through this work, she will master skills that are critical for her scientific
development including primary muscle cell culture, live-cell trafficking studies, in situ hybridization, muscle
contractility studies, molecular cloning, and versatile computational skills. The applicant will undergo
exceptional training from her sponsor, co-sponsor, and collaborators at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill. She will receive additional support from the institutional environment through research core
facilities, topical group meetings, and her department. The proposed research and training plan will build a
very strong foundation upon which the applicant will develop her independent research program."
10902657,"Project Summary
The vestibular inner ear detects head motion through displacement of mechanosensitive stereocilia bundles on
hair cells (HCs). Primary vestibular afferents encode these bundle deflections using distinct firing patterns
referred to as regular and irregular based on the spike timing variability. Both afferent classes encode head
motions using spike rates but irregular afferents also encode features based on precise spike timing. HC and
afferents are modulated by efferent vestibular neurons located in the brainstem. Efferents lower HC voltage gain
but excite afferents and the larger impacts of efferent feedback on vestibular afferent encoding and vestibular-
mediated performance remain hypothetical.
Three key aspects of computation in the vestibular periphery remain to be investigated. First, vestibular afferents
have typically modeled single neurons to explain how a few biophysical properties influence neural coding.
However, these models do not capture the entire picture of how the vestibular periphery (i.e. the population of
HCs and afferents) encodes head motions. Second, the vestibular epithelium is spatially organized by preferred
stimulus direction and afferent subtype – irregular afferents emerge from the central region of the epithelium
(striola) while regular emerge from the peripheral zone (extrastriola). The zones show distinct physiological and
structural properties yet prior models have only incorporated a few. It remains unknown how these various
properties work together and contribute to neural coding. Finally, previous work has characterized how efferents
modulate spontaneous HC and afferent dynamics at a single unit level, yet how these modulatory effects
influence mechanically evoked responses (i.e. hair bundle deflections) as well as neural coding at a population
level is unknown.
The objective of this proposal is to develop circuit-level computational models of the vestibular periphery (i.e. a
population of HCs, afferents and efferent feedback) that incorporates voltage-gated ion channels, afferent
morphology, and topographical organization. These models will give us a higher-level perspective on how
biological properties, spatial organization and efferents influence both neural coding and response dynamics.
Our circuit-level models may also provide insight into vestibular efferents modulate and stabilize vestibular
functioning."
10906074,"The sirtuin family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylases act as metabolic energy sensors, mediate some of the beneficial effects of caloric restriction on lifespan, and are important regulators of the aging process. NAD augmentation by administration of NAD precursors, such as nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), prevents or reverses a number of aging-related conditions, including diabetes and diabetic nephropathy, and improves aerobic performance. Reduced NAD levels in the kidney are closely linked to the pathogenic mechanisms of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in mice as well as in humans, and NMN supplementation prevents the development of DKD and reduces mortality in a mouse model of DKD. These data support the hypothesis that NAD augmentation by NMN administration will reduce urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR), a hallmark of DKD that is predictive of renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Despite the availability of a number of effective therapies for DKD, substantial residual risk to develop end-stage kidney disease still remains; thus, there is a need for new approaches that provide additional risk reduction by targeting different mechanisms. The sirtuin-NAD activators are attractive because: 1) they act by a mechanism distinct from that of currently approved drugs; and 2) they target aging mechanisms and have the potential to improve physical function and other age-related conditions. We propose to conduct a Phase 2a, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial in older adults, 60 years or older, with type 2 diabetes mellitus, UACR > 100 mg/g creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 30 mL/min/ /1.73m2. Participants will be randomized to receive either 1.0 g NMN or placebo twice daily for 6 months, stratified by sex and age (60-75, >75 years). The primary outcome is the change in UACR over the 6-month period. Secondary outcomes include change from baseline over 6-months in the following: the proportion of participants with 30% or greater reduction in UACR; change in serum creatinine and eGFR; glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose); blood pressure; biomarkers of aging and kidney injury; self-reported (Late Life Function and Disability Index - Computer Adaptive Technology Version) and performance-based measures of physical function (aerobic capacity measured as VO2peak; 6-minute walking distance); and circulating levels of NMN and its metabolites, and NAD levels. We will also determine whether the increases in NAD levels in the PBMCs and improvements in UACR persist 3 months after treatment completion (legacy effect). The rigor and innovation in this trial is underscored by the use of a high-quality crystalline formulation of NMN; a dose-regimen informed by carefully performed pharmacokinetic studies; rigorous sample collection procedures to ensure preanalytical stability; and strong scientific premise founded on compelling preclinical and human studies of the important role of NAD depletion in DKD."

The goal of the U19 application “Neural circuit control of fluid and solute clearance during sleep” is to understand
how neural activity drives periarterial CSF inflow and thereby glymphatic waste clearance across time, micro-
macroscopic spatial scales, and species. The program brings together experts in neural computation,
neurovascular coupling, sleep, human neuroimaging, fluid dynamics, and modeling, with a long track record of
productive collaborations.
 The Administrative Core will serve as the hub that will coordinate all aspects of the U19 program
functions. Its major goal is to facilitate the exchange of ideas and interactions and to promote the scientific
excellence of the program. The Administrative Core will also oversee that the Data Core shares data within the
U19 program and the outside community. The Core will provide fiscal oversight of all aspects of the program and
implement decisions made by the Internal Review Committee (consisting of the project and core leaders as well
as the program manager) and the External Advisory Board (consisting of 6 internationally recognized scientists
with experience in collaborative studies and data sharing/modeling). One of the Administrative Core’s tasks is to
continuously adjust the use of the Data Science and Viral Tool Development Cores to maximize their support of
the 4 projects. The Administrative Core will also organize and submit the annual progress reports to NIH. The
Core Facility will organize all routine meetings within the program, including core staff meetings, the Internal and
External Advisory Board meetings, the cross-institutional administrative meetings, the annual meeting, and the
site visits. Finally, the Administrative Core will optimize communication between PIs, collaborating faculty, PhD,
MS, and undergraduate students, as well as research staff, to foster a team-based approach to science and
facilitate frequent lab exchanges and opportunities for trainee scientific development.
 Altogether, the ambitions of the Administrative Core are to ensure that the overall project runs as
efficiently as possible to reach the research goals and fulfills all requirements of federal and institutional
regulations. Our goals are to understand, for the first time, how coordinated neural activity drives clearance of
fluid and solutes during sleep; and to share with the greater neuroscience community our ideas, data, and
research tools."
10898600,"Abstract, Data Science Core
The goal of this proposal is to characterize and quantify how neural circuits control cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow
and solute clearance during sleep and wake, in both mice and humans. Achieving that goal will require combining
multimodal data from mathematical models and various experiments in both species. The Data Science Core
will provide the essential infrastructure and produce innovative data methods to enable powerful synergy among
the Projects. First, because the Projects will produce enormous data sets, and because the data will be
multimodal (MRI, two-photon imaging, simulation results, EEG, and more), productive collaboration will require
careful attention to storing, organizing, processing, analyzing, and internally sharing the data. Aim 1 is to provide
data infrastructure and staffing for seamless integration of all Projects, for synergistic code development and
sharing, and for rapid analysis of multimodal data via efficient workflows, always leveraging existing best
practices. Second, discovering the causal links among neural control, CSF flow, and solute clearance will require
tools and analyses that do not yet exist. Aim 2 is to build transformative tools leveraging quantitative, data-driven
methods to measure CSF flow, its drivers, their neural control mechanisms, and the resulting efflux. Third, the
novel data and tools produced in Projects 1-4 will have potential to advance the field, enabling a range of new
scientific questions, especially if they are disseminated widely. Aim 3 is to document the software tools we
develop, annotate the data we produce, and share both publicly. The Data Science Core will build on existing
methods and tools previously developed by the co-PIs, take advantage of best practices in the field, and combine
the expertise of experienced data scientists to build novel tools. Documented code will be shared via GitHub.
We will use a two-tiered system for sharing data internally, in which each Project will leverage their existing data
workflows and keep some data locally; meanwhile, data shared among Projects will be stored on the BlueHive
supercomputer at the University of Rochester, available to all U19 participants. We will develop a clear
organizational structure for shared data, storing metadata in sidecar files and implementing a searchable
database to facilitate collaboration and interaction among the Projects. We will keep a searchable stock list of
tools provided by the Virus Core, along with delivery times and histories. Annotated data will be shared publicly
via repositories upon publication. A full-time data scientist will be employed to lead day-to-day Core activities,
along with two PhD students."
10898603,"Viral Tool Development Core - Abstract
Expression of genetically encoded biosensors and cell-type-specific opto-/pharmacogenetic manipulation
represent effective approaches to reveal the mechanisms behind brain fluid dynamics during sleep. Most current
technologies for labeling brain circulation are invasive and alter dynamics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. The
Viral Tool Development Core will develop novel, minimally-invasive methods to transform the study of CSF flow.
The Core will support Projects 2 and 3 by providing viral vectors designed to label key fluid compartments,
specifically interstitial fluid, CSF, and blood. This will be achieved by a combination of capsids, promoters, signal
peptides, and gene traps in the case of adeno-associated viral vector (AAV). Other recombinant viral vectors will
be designed as needed. In Aim 1, we will swiftly establish a viral tool development pipeline to provide in vivo
verified viral vectors that will be optimized and validated. In Aim 2, we will engineer a set of viral tools that will
express fluorescent albumin by transfecting the liver, allowing longitudinal vascular imaging after a single
intravenous injection. In Aim 3, we will extend the utility of the blood probe by attaching biosensors or photo-
activatable fluorescent proteins to report blood conditions or visualize CSF. In Aim 4, we will engineer a knock-
in AAV vector to incorporate successful probes for permanent expression.
 The virally mediated expression of the innovative probes will allow for longitudinal imaging in existing
transgenic mice without a need for further breeding, hence provides cost- and time-effective solutions for this
research program. While the core will closely interact with Projects 2 and 3, the in vivo testing results for novel
viral vectors will be shared and analyzed with the Data Science Core for comparisons with conventional probes.
New probe ideas will be discussed with all research teams to determine the critical measurements that optical
imaging can provide particularly from theoretical (Project 1) and human brain (Project 4) viewpoints."
10898606,"Abstract, Project 1
The overall goal of this proposal is to establish how neural activity drives periarterial CSF pumping and thereby
glymphatic clearance of metabolic waste. Project 1 will address that goal via fluid-dynamical modeling of flow at
the microscale, flow at the macroscale, and brain-wide clearance – all in both mice and humans. Project 1 will
unify the microscale mechanisms and macroscale phenomena measured in Projects 2-4 and deliver predictive,
quantitative, testable models. We postulate that neural circuit activity controls glymphatic function at the
microscale via dynamics of the neurovascular unit, comprised of an arteriole, the perivascular space (PVS)
surrounding it, and the surrounding neuropil. Aim 1 will use detailed fluid-dynamical simulations of the unit, with
domain shapes and boundary conditions taken from measurements, and with vasomotion linked empirically to
norepinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine (ACh) levels, to characterize and quantify microscale CSF flows and
drivers in mice. We postulate that neural activity exerts global control by enlarging and reducing the extracellular
space, and through interactions on the network of PVSs. Aim 2 will build a brain-wide hydraulic network model
to quantify the effects of global drivers and characterize CSF flow across the entire mouse brain. An essential
function of CSF flow in the brain is solute clearance. Aim 3 will build a brain-wide clearance model, taking flows
from Aim 2, independently quantifying the effects of advection and diffusion, and accounting for changes in brain
state. Aim 4 will build models analogous to those of Aims 1-3, but for humans instead of mice, and supplemented
by detailed fluid-dynamical simulations of ventricle flow. This multi-species proposal is designed to reveal how
neural circuits control cerebrospinal fluid movement in the mouse and human brain.
 Project 1 will integrate quantitative measurements of neural activity, blood volume, and CSF movement,
from Projects 2-4. The experiments will provide parameters for local and global models, including anatomical
shapes, inlet and outlet boundary conditions, and spatiotemporal hemodynamic changes. Models will reveal
more information than is accessible experimentally and allow causal manipulations that are impossible in vivo,
thereby leading to new hypotheses to be tested. Project 2 will provide PVS shapes and solute efflux
measurements (DB53) as well as astrocytic dynamics (via Ca2+ and cAMP sensors). Project 3 will provide
spatiotemporal hemodynamic patterns and their dependence on neural and neuromodulatory activity (via Ca2+
and biosensors for NE and ACh). Project 4 will provide data from humans: ventricle and PVS shapes,
hemodynamics, and CSF flow in ventricles and PVSs, across spontaneous and sensory-driven neural activity."
10898612,"Abstract_Project 2
Many lines of work show that glymphatic flow plays a key role in brain waste clearance during sleep. Yet, the
mechanisms driving glymphatic flow and its regulation by the state of brain activity are poorly understood. Like
the other projects in the U19 application, Project 2 will focus on understanding what drives periarterial CSF influx.
We are basing the periarterial CSF pumping model on the well-documented mechanism of functional hyperemia,
i.e., transient increases in blood flow and volume in response to neural activity. We postulate that CSF in parallel
is pumped along the periarterial spaces to compensate for local or global changes in vascular volume. Thus,
glymphatic fluid transport peaks during NREM sleep because coordinated neural activity drives larger changes
in blood volume than in the awake state. Aim 1 will with high spatio-temporal resolution image the effect of
whisker stimulation on Ca2+/cAMP signaling in the individual cell populations of the neurovascular unit on the
diameters of penetrating arterioles, and on the velocity of CSF in periarterial spaces (as measured by particle
tracking). We will determine the drivers of periarterial CSF pumping using optogenetic stimulation of neurons,
astrocytes, or smooth muscle cells with simultaneous observations via 2-photon or macroscopic imaging in mice.
Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that natural sleep states determine not only the activity pattern of neural circuits,
but also the physical dimensions and the functional properties of the perivascular spaces, and thereby the
efficacy of periarterial CSF pumping. Operationally, we will use the same paradigms proposed in Aim 1, including
sensory whisker stimulations and cell-specific optogenetic activation, in awake and sleeping (NREM) mice. Aim
3 will establish whether periarterial CSF pumping predicts glymphatic clearance. We will take advantage of a
novel clearance assay based on intracortical injection of a small fluorescent tracer (DB53, BBB-impermeable)
that accumulates in blood after clearance from brain, so that the signal in blood reflects total DB53 brain efflux,
independent of the clearance routes. We will systematically manipulate periarterial CSF pumping and determine
its effect on DB53 clearance after intracortical delivery.
Overall, Project 2 will contribute to the U19 proposal by testing the hypothesis that neural circuit activity
determines glymphatic solute clearance by controlling the structural and physical properties of the neurovascular
unit and thereby the efficacy of periarterial CSF pumping in a brain state dependent mechanism. Project 2
depends critically on the fluid dynamic modelling in Project 1, while Project 3 will provide key information on
which neuronal populations control neurovascular coupling during sleep. Projects 2 and 3 will together serve as
an important source of cellular information for the neuroimaging studies in Project 4, bridging cellular
mechanisms and consequences for solute clearance with the multiscale dynamics observed in the human brain."
10898613,"Abstract, Project 3
Sleep is accompanied by large changes in neural activity, modulatory state, and hemodynamics. The large
arterial dilations and contractions during sleep could drive perivascular pumping of CSF, which would help clear
fluid and solutes from the brain. We hypothesize that during NREM sleep, the large oscillations of arterial
diameter are driven by local neural activity and coordinated globally across the cortex by noradrenergic (NE) and
cholinergic (ACh) neuromodulatory drive. We will test this idea by optically imaging the cortical vasculature of
sleeping mice while perturbing neural activity and neuromodulation. In Aim 1, we will alter the activity of defined
neuronal populations during sleep using opto-and chemogenetic tools to determine the role of local neural activity
in controlling vascular dynamics. In Aim 2, we will use fluorescent biosensors, optogenetics, and chemogenetics
to understand the role of cholinergic and noradrenergic modulation in coordinating the global cortical vascular
dynamics during sleep. We will measure the temporal relationship between ACh and NE modulation, and dissect
their respective roles in controlling hemodynamics during sleep. In Aim 3, we will use multiplane two-photon
imaging to visualize the directions of propagation of arterial constrictions and dilations and widefield imaging of
neural and vascular signals to visualize how vascular activity is coordinated across multiple spatial scales during
sleep.
 Project 3 will contribute to the overall U19 proposal by dissecting the neural mechanisms controlling
arterial dilations and constrictions during NREM sleep. Our measures of arterial dynamics at both the local and
global scales during sleep will provide important data for the modeling in Project 1. Our use of the mouse model
will complement the measurements in Project 2. It will also help bridge the detailed mechanistic studies relating
arterial diameter changes of CSF movement in Project 2 with the other Projects by making corresponding arterial
dynamics measures during sleep. Our determination of causal relationships among neuromodulation, neuronal
subtype activity, and vascular dynamics will be applied to understand the simultaneous EEG and neuroimaging
data in Project 4."
10898615,"Abstract, Project 4
 During NREM sleep, large waves of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow appear in the brain. Neural slow waves
precede these CSF flow waves by several seconds, suggesting that coherent neural activity could drive CSF
flow by inducing large-scale neurovascular coupling. This project will test the hypothesis that the spatiotemporal
dynamics of neural activity regulate how CSF flows in the human brain. We will optimize and integrate multiple
novel MR technologies to image CSF flow in the ventricles and in perivascular spaces, with simultaneous
measures of neural activity using EEG, and hemodynamic responses using fMRI. In Aim 1, we will test whether
spatiotemporally patterned neural activity is linked to CSF flow, measured during well-established visual tasks.
In Aim 2, we will test whether the dynamics of spontaneous neural activity during sleep are coupled to CSF flow
at multiple spatial scales. In Aim 3, we will identify how activity in basal forebrain and locus coeruleus, which
release norepinephrine and acetylcholine, is linked to the relationship between coherent neural activity and CSF
flow. Together, these Aims will test how neural activity is linked to CSF flow across sleep and wakefulness in the
human brain, from ventricles down to perivascular spaces.
 Project 4 will contribute to the overall U19 goals by determining the link between neural activity and CSF
flow at multiple spatial scales. By performing whole-brain imaging in humans, we can test how both local and
global neural dynamics are linked to CSF flow in the tiny perivascular spaces and in the much-larger ventricles.
By interacting with Project 2, our EEG-based measures of neural coherence will be linked to cellular-level
measures of neuronal activity, with both our projects testing the link to CSF flow in the perivascular space. Our
interactions with Project 3 will be critical to inform how neuromodulators shape vascular dynamics, and how
neurovascular coupling is altered across sleep and wakefulness. Finally, our continuous interactions with Project
1 will be essential in order to determine which empirical measurements are needed to fully specify the model,
and then update the model to make further predictions."

Conventional vaccine strategies have not induced successful protection to diverse HIV strains. mRNA vaccine
platforms enable novel modalities of antigen delivery for innovative vaccine strategies. The use of mRNA
technology for HIV vaccines holds promise to conquer major barriers to induce protective responses via
broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). However, mRNA vaccines to express HIV antigens capable of
effectively conferring protective immunity have not been fully explored. Germinal center (GC) responses are
paramount for prophylactic vaccines as they provide a highly specialized environment to affinity mature
antibodies to difficult epitopes on HIV. We have demonstrated that efficient priming and longer duration of GC
responses are likely favorable for broader neutralizing responses against HIV (Nature 2022). mRNA vaccines
against SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to induce long-lasting GC responses after 2 doses, but the biology and
effective manipulation of this process remains elusive. Particularly, a big knowledge gap is how mRNA
vaccine-induced GCs differ from protein vaccines. A second knowledge gap is what mechanisms drive long-
lasting GCs? A third knowledge gap is what immunological signals regulate the output of durable immune
memory? HIV envelope (Env) trimer is the sole antigenic target for neutralizing antibodies. Many experimental
HIV vaccines use soluble forms of Env that expose the immunodominant base of the trimer eliciting non-
neutralizing antibodies. mRNA vaccines allow the realization of membrane-bound Env expression, which can
present antigen in a more native form avoiding exposure of the base. Membrane-bound Env trimers can also
be expressed on nanoparticles such as virus-like particles (VLPs) via mRNA delivery resembling higher density
expression on native virions. Given the potential of long-lasting GC responses and the new modes of antigen
delivery by membrane-bound Env or multimeric Env nanoparticles, we seek to investigate: Are HIV mRNA
vaccines capable of inducing long-lasting GC responses? How can HIV mRNA vaccines optimally prime long-
lasting GC responses? What sequential immunization strategies work best with HIV mRNA vaccines to induce
diverse and durable memory responses? Non-human primates (NHPs) are an invaluable model for studying
this biology and immunology, because of their relatedness to humans."

In Ghana, MSM bear a high HIV burden, yet less than 4% of HIV-positive MSM are on antiretroviral therapy—a
disparity found throughout Africa. Social stressors, such as sexuality- and gender-based stigma, criminalization,
and violence, have been linked to both poor mental health and HIV outcomes and may be barriers to optimal
HIV service engagement among African MSM. The goal of this K01 application is to apply intersectionality and
minority stress theory to examine the impact of intersectional social stressors on mental health and HIV treatment
and care of HIV-positive men who have sex with men in Ghana and to adapt and theater test a community-
engaged intersectional stigma intervention to improve mental health and HIV treatment outcomes. To achieve
this goal, the training aims of this proposal are: 1) to develop content expertise in intersectional social stressors
and minority stress theory and the intersection of these theories in understanding mental health; 2) to develop
methodological expertise in intersectional social stressor measurement, including how latent constructs are
operationalized and measured; 3) to gain methodological expertise in advanced statistical methods (structural
equation modeling, mediation, and dominance analysis) towards understanding pathways that can be interrupted
to improve health; and 4) to obtain knowledge & skills in community engaged, evidence-based intersectional
intervention design in order to conduct impactful interventions for the populations most in need. The training aims
will be achieved through a research plan that proposes to integrate intersectionality and minority stress theory
and operationalize measures to study the following specific aims: 1) to explore the intersectional social stressor,
mental health, and HIV treatment experiences of HIV-positive MSM in order to adapt, conceptually define, and
operationalize constructs in the integrated intersectional minority stress model for use in Ghana; 2) to identify
intervenable factors in the relationship between intersectional social stressors, mental health, protective factors,
and HIV treatment outcomes (linkage and retention in treatment and care); and 3) to adapt and theater test an
integrated intersectional mental health and HIV treatment intervention to help MSM cope with the impact of
intersectional social stressors on HIV treatment outcomes."

Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Almost 50% of youth
tobacco users now concurrently use two or more tobacco products—defined as multiple tobacco product
(MTP) use. Youth MTP use is concerning because it associated with a two-fold increase in nicotine
dependence symptoms, decreased likelihood of successful quitting, and increased risk of other substance use
and mental health problems. Many communication messages exist to warn youth of the harms of specific
tobacco products, like e-cigarettes or cigarettes. However, almost all tobacco communication messages
focus on one tobacco product at a time, which could lead MTP users to consume the tobacco product that
is not the target of the messages. Moreover, these communication messages may not work well with MTP
users who are more likely than single tobacco users to underestimate the harms of tobacco, be more
dependent on nicotine, and be of lower socioeconomic status (SES). The overarching goal of the proposed
K01 project is to develop and evaluate messages about the harms of MTP use. The primary hypothesis is that
MTP messages will increase intentions to quit using all tobacco products more than existing messages that
focus only on single tobacco products and control messages. A secondary goal is to determine the impact of
messages among youth at higher risk of MTP use, specifically youth of lower SES. In Aim 1, I will identify
effective themes for youth-oriented messages that communicate the harms of MTP use. In Aim 2, I will
develop a set of high impact messages that discourages MTP use among youth and determine whether other
message elements (e.g., testimonials, quitting approach, self-efficacy cue) increase tobacco quit intentions
using a discrete choice experiment (DCE) with youth MTP users. Finally, in Aim 3, I will conduct a three-arm
pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with youth MTP users (50% lower SES) to see if the MTP messages
delivered as text messages over a two-week period increase tobacco quit intentions more than existing
messages that focus only on single tobacco products and control messages. This research would make
significant and timely contributions to the development of tobacco control communication strategies in the
United States and is responsive to FDA’s interest in communications research. My long-term career goal is to
conduct independent research that focuses on preventing and reducing youth tobacco use through health
communication interventions. This career development award will help me reach this goal by providing new
training in a) health communication theory and message development, b) experimental design for health
communication research, including design of discrete choice experiments, and c) eHealth interventions for
youth. My training plan includes apprenticeships with my mentorship team, formal coursework, hands-on
research activities, and workshops. This award will culminate in a R01 application for a full-scale RCT testing
the effectiveness of MTP messages on quit attempts and other behavioral outcomes among youth MTP users."

Gastric carcinoma (GAC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death world-wide, causing more
than 700,000 deaths each year. Unfortunately, the majority of gastric cancer patients are diagnosed at a late
stage (Stage III or IV) in the United States, with a poor response to therapy and five-year survival rate of 5.2%.
Infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a type I carcinogen, is the main risk factor for gastric
carcinogenesis. Infection with H. pylori creates a unique environment where epithelial cells must adapt to
chronic cellular stress and are forced develop adaptive survival fitness properties that not only promote
tumorigenesis but also resistance to chemotherapeutics. Understanding the molecular functions of
carcinogenic biological factors such as H. pylori infection is a key step for developing evidence-based
therapeutic approaches that are founded on the biology and molecular underpinning of gastric carcinogenesis.
We have found that Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is a critical target at the 20q amplicon, overexpressed in
approximately 60% of gastric cancers. We identified novel functions of AURKA in promoting EIF4E and cap-
dependent translation of critical genes such as SOX9 and LGR5 that promote survival and expansion of
tumorigenic cells in response to infection. We have also found that treatment-resistant cells were enriched for
high levels of AURKA, SOX9, and LGR5. This proposal has three specific aims that include mechanistic,
functional, and translational studies using unique in vitro and in vivo models, including organoid cultures and
mouse models. In aim 1, we will investigate the mechanistic role of AURKA in reprogramming the translational
machinery in response to infection with H. pylori. We will determine the AURKA-dependent functions in
promoting gastric tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy, using in vivo models in Aim 2. The translational
significance of our findings and therapeutic efficacy of targeting AURKA will be investigated in Aim 3. Upon
completion of this work, we expect to unveil a new paradigm of cross-talk between AURKA and EIF4E-
dependent translational machinery in promoting gastric tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy."

Leishmania braziliensis infection may cause a high spectrum of clinical manifestation, including the more
prevalent form, cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Inflammatory response is a hallmark of CL and high levels of
TNF, IL-1b, and cytotoxicity are associated with skin ulcer development in these individuals. Our preliminary
data show that obese CL patients have more severe disease, longer time to heal and high levels of circulating
leptin. We will characterize the inflammatory infiltrate observed in the adipose tissue from obese CL patients
and determine the role of adipokines in deleterious inflammation in these individuals. Lipid profiles may vary
across individuals, and they may be pro-inflammatory or contribute to the healing process. Here we will
investigate the lipid profile of obese patients and seek correlation with therapeutic failure in CL. Finally, we will
investigate whether lipids associated with tissue healing can reprogram macrophages to a non-inflammatory /
tissue repair phenotype. We hypothesize that increased levels of leptin and a particular lipid profile enhance
the inflammatory response, leading to poor outcome in obese CL individuals. The overall objective of this
proposal is to determine how adipose tissue integrates with the inflammatory response, influencing the severity
of CL caused by Leishmania braziliensis, and consequently increasing the rate of therapeutic failure of CL
patients."

 Macrophages are mononuclear phagocytes that play an important role in tissue homeostasis and
resolution of inflammation and are crucial players in mounting potent antiviral immune responses. Previously in
wild-type (WT) mice, we found that a balance of M1 and M2 macrophages is important for virus replication in
the eye, eye disease, and latency-reactivation. During the current funding period, we showed that M1
macrophages play an important role in virus replication, eye disease, survival, phagocytosis, and autophagy in
ocularly infected mice. Our progress during the current funding period has provided novel insights into
potential mechanisms by which induction of macrophage memory may define the extent of primary infection
and eye disease but not latency-reactivation. Building on our published and preliminary studies, we
hypothesize that acquisition of macrophage memory phenotype plays a key role in determining virus
replication, eye disease, and survival. Memory macrophages express IRGM1 (immunity-related GTPase family
M protein) and in macrophages from latently infected mice, IRGM1 is upregulated in M1 but not M2
macrophages. Thus, the corollary of this hypothesis is that generation of memory M1 macrophage can be used
to safeguard the integrity of the anterior segment of the eye including the cornea in response to viral infection.
These observations also suggest mechanisms that may provide innovative potential therapeutic targets to
prevent ocular HSV-1 infection and HSV-1-induced eye disease. Feasibility of the proposed studies is rooted in
an experimental strategy that combines in vitro and in vivo studies with conditional knockout and IRGM1-/- mice
to directly evaluate the contribution of IRGM1 to M1, and not M2, macrophage memory functions that affect
virus replication in the eye, eye disease, and survival in ocularly infected mice. Our preliminary studies led to
our overall hypothesis that macrophages adapt to HSV-1 infection, a property termed “trained immunity” or as
originally reported for CD8 T cells, “memory immunity”. Understanding the properties of trained immunity in
macrophages and in the earliest ocular infiltrates after HSV-1 infection, will improve our understanding of host
defense mechanisms and the pathogenesis of innate-mediated diseases. We will test this model by: (1)
Determining whether macrophages have memory to HSV-1 that helps to reduce ocular virus replication,
inflammation, and eye disease; and (2) Determining whether M1 rather than M2 macrophages contribute to
memory. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Because the extent and duration of initial virus replication are key
determinants of subsequent pathologic inflammatory responses, accumulation of immune cell populations early
in infection provides an important target for prevention. Results of the proposed studies will determine whether
manipulating macrophage responses by regulating trained immunity can be used to reduce ocular viral load
and accelerate ocular viral clearance, thereby reducing eye disease."

Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (AATD) is the most common, underdiagnosed inherited genetic condition
(1:1500) and the primary modifier for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (300 million patients world-
wide- 3 million deaths annually). AATD is an aging and genotype sensitive disease. Onset and progression
results from misfolding of variant (mutant) forms of AAT in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the liver leading to
aggregation triggering progressive liver disease, and subsequent loss-of-function of neutrophil elastase (NE)
inhibitory activity in serum and the lung leading to pulmonary failure by mid-to-late decades of life. Effective
treatment of AATD is a critical unmet need. This proposal addresses an emergent challenge to understand how
diverse variants in the AAT protein encoded by the genome of the world-wide population differentially contribute
to both gain- and loss-of-function disease pathology and how proteostasis (the protein folding program in the
cell) involving the unfolded protein response (UPR) ATF6 and IRE1/XBP1s signaling pathways, can be
manipulated by small molecules to therapeutically manage disease in the individual harboring a unique variant.
ATF6 and IRE/XBP1s signaling pathways adjust the capacity of the ER associated protein folding machinery
including the cytosolic heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 (Hsp70) ER paralog Grp78/BIP/HSBA5 chaperone/co-
chaperone system and the Hsp90 ER paralog Grp94 to restore balance in response to misfolding and ER stress.
We now apply Gaussian process (GP) regression machine learning based variation spatial profiling (VSP), an
innovative yet well validated tool (described in 11 publications to date for multiple proteins) that we have
pioneered to advance our understanding of the spatial covariance (SCV) relationships dictating AAT fold design
to develop novel therapeutic approaches for AATD. In Aims 1 and 2 we hypothesize that ATF6 and IRE1/XBP1s
signaling pathways, respectively, can be adjusted to mitigate AATD using small molecule activators of these
signaling pathways for nearly the entire spectrum of AAT variants in the patient population, experiments to be
performed in collaboration with our Co-Investigators Drs. Kelly and Wiseman at Scripps Research. We have
substantial preliminary data attesting to the effectiveness of UPR modulators across a broad spectrum of AAT
variants found in the patient population (Sun et. al., (2023) Cell Chem. Biol.). We propose that these efforts will
lead to effective, long term management AAT misfolding to mitigate severity of disease progression of AATD in
the clinic. In Aim 3, we hypothesize that a deep understanding of the role of UPR regulated components found
in the ER can explain the biology behind ATF6 and IRE1/XBP1s signaling pathway chemical modulators,
providing a solid mechanistic understanding of disease to direct drug development. Through a deep
understanding of GP based SCV properties of the collective of variants affecting AAT fold design driving
dysfunction in the world-wide patient population, we hope to discover how precise adjustments to the
proteostasis program can be used generate a precision perspective for therapeutic management of individual."

conserved in eukaryotes, and many have crucial roles in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in human
health. Lack of any of several modifications in the tRNA body (outside the anticodon loop) results in growth
defects in S. cerevisiae, and is linked to neurological disorders in humans. We study the rapid tRNA decay
(RTD) pathway in S. cerevisiae, which targets a subset of mature tRNAs lacking any of four body
modifications, due to exposure of the 5' end to the 5'-3' exonucleases Rat1 and Xrn1. RTD also occurs in fully
modified tRNA variants with destabilizing mutations exposing the 5' end, and is inhibited in met22Δ mutants
due to accumulation of the Met22 substrate adenosine 3',5' bis-phosphate (pAp), which inhibits Rat1 and Xrn1.
 As little is known about the biology of body modifications in other eukaryotes, we study the evolutionarily
distant yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which diverged from S. cerevisiae ~600 million years ago and has
facile genetics and molecular biology. Using genetic selection and whole genome sequencing of multiple
suppressors of growth defects of body modification mutants, we found that each of two S. pombe body
modification mutants target decay of a subset of the hypomodified tRNAs by part, but not all, of the RTD
pathway, establishing conservation of the use of this pathway. We also found new interactions between body
modifications, the RTD pathway, the ribosome, and a major conserved stress response pathway (the human
integrated stress response pathway) in both S. pombe and S. cerevisiae. Our current study of S. pombe pus1Δ
mutants, lacking pseudouridine (Ψ), and S. pombe tan1Δ mutants, lacking 4-acetylcytidine (ac4C12), has also
yielded new insights. Preliminary results with the pus1Δ mutant show decay of one specific tRNA by the RTD
pathway that is responsible for its growth defect, and an unexpected connection between decay and a major
conserved pathway that is also linked to the human PUS1 disease phenotype. Preliminary results with the
tan1Δ mutants show decay of two tRNAs by the RTD pathway that is responsible for its growth defect, and an
unexpected connection between decay and a conserved nuclease not known to have this role. To follow up we
will: 1A) Analyze the biology of S. pombe pus1Δ mutants. 1B) Analyze the biology of S. pombe tan1Δ mutants.
 Despite the importance of tRNA decay, remarkably little is known about the turnover rates of individual
wild type (WT) tRNAs or about cellular factors that influence these rates. In addition, little is known about
turnover of tRNA ends, although the 3' CCA ends of tRNAs are known to undergo constant repair to ensure
healthy growth, and are the focus of several regulatory pathways. To follow up we will 2) Determine tRNA end
repair rates and tRNA turnover rates of individual tRNAs, using metabolic labeling and mass spectrometry."
10879616,"Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are environmental bacteria that cause serious pulmonary
infections in people with underlying lung diseases. One of the most common NTMs associated
with pulmonary disease is Mycobacterium abscessus (Mabs). Mabs is highly drug resistant, and
it is the most difficult NTM to treat. The therapeutic use of bacteriophage (phage), which are
viruses that infect and kill bacteria, is a potential alternative to antibiotics for treating drug
resistant bacteria including Mabs. Recent compassionate use cases where NTM disease was
treated with phage, highlight the potential for phage to be a new therapeutic option for Mabs
infection. At the same time, the recent cases emphasize the need to better understand and
improve the approach of using phage to treat Mabs infection.
 Phage dosing in the recent Mabs treatment cases was performed without knowledge of
in vivo phage exposure over time (pharmacokinetics, PK) or the impact of phage on the Mabs
burden (pharmacodynamics, PD). For any bacterial infection, knowledge of phage PK/PD,
which differs from traditional small molecule PK/PD, is minimal. This R01 proposal addresses
this significant gap in knowledge. Using a Mabs isolate and phage from recent clinical cases
and a mouse lung infection model, we will perform the first in vivo PK/PD studies of phage
therapy to treat Mabs infection. Time course PK/PD data, along with pathology, spatial analysis
of phage and Mabs localization in the lung, and respiratory function data, will be used to
develop an in silico quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model that describes in vivo
interactions between phage, Mabs, and the host. With the aid of phage PK/PD knowledge we
will also systematically investigate different phage dosing strategies to optimize phage treatment
and improve therapeutic outcome. In Aim 1, we will evaluate PK/PD of phage delivered via the
intravenous (IV) route or intratracheal (IT) route. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the PK/PD of
liposome-encapsulated phage. Liposome encapsulation may help target phage to
macrophages, which serve as an intracellular niche for Mabs, and it may shield phage from host
clearance or inactivation. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the effect on phage PK/PD of combining
phage with antibiotic drug treatment. The results of these Aims will provide mechanistic insights
into interactions between phage, Mabs, host, and antibiotic and they will support our long-term
objective of using QSP modeling to promote translation of phage therapy for Mabs infection to
successful use in the clinic."
10883777,"Summary: Sickle cell disease (SCD) primarily afflicts African-Americans in the US, exacerbating an existing
health disparity. Approximately 1 in 13 African-American babies is born with the sickle cell trait and ~100,000
individuals live with SCD. Along with a range of adverse physiological effects resulting in painful vaso-occlusive
crises (VOC), patients suffer from poorer quality of life and a significantly decreased life expectancy (only 54
years). A handful of drugs are currently FDA approved; however, despite their benefits, there are drawbacks.
Hydroxyurea is effective for two genotypes accounting for only 60% of SCD patients and the frequency of painful
episodes is reduced by only 50%. Newer drugs (L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, voxelotor) lack improvement in
hemoglobin levels or lack reduction in number of VOCs. Alternative treatments, such as chronic blood transfusion
therapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, can provide benefit but can also lead to serious complications
or impose roadblocks including cost and finding matching donors. There is a significant unmet need for potent,
novel multi-modal SCD therapeutics that achieve optimal efficacy, safety, and quality of life. To meet this need,
Vascular Vision proposes a sulfated oxidized non-anticoagulant low molecular weight heparin (S-NACH) to
provide an extensive range of bioactivities without causing bleeding, a common dose limiting effect associated
with the clinical use of low molecular weight heparins. Proof-of-concept in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies
have established efficacy through multiple modes including anti-adhesion, anti-inflammation, anti-sickling,
vascular antithrombotic, and endothelial relaxation. Our subcutaneous nanoformulation (VVP728) demonstrated
improved SCD pharmacodynamics. This SBIR Phase II proposes IND-enabling studies to determine tolerability
of nanoformulated S-NACH (VVP728) in support of first in human trials (FIH) through the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Scale up manufacturing to establish PK/PD and support IND-enabling studies. To support
preclinical PK/PD and GLP toxicology testing, we will scale up the manufacturing of research grade drug
substance (DS: S-NACH) and drug product (DP: VVP728). Milestones: (1) Develop analytical and bioanalytical
methods, (2) Deliver research grade DS (2 kg) and DP (1.5 kg) under GLP, and (3) Determine PK and vascular
antithrombotic activity in rats and PD in Townes SCD mouse model for DS vs DP. Aim 2: Determine GLP safety
profile of S-NACH. We will conduct dose range finding studies (7 days) and GLP repeated dose studies (28
days) in rodent (rat) and non-rodent (dog) as well as in vitro assessments of protein binding, transporter and
CYP inhibition, effect on hERG current in transfected HEK-293 cells, and genotoxicity. In vivo central nervous
system (CNS: rats), respiratory (dogs), and cardiovascular (dogs) assessments will be completed. Milestones:
(1) Establish protein binding and potential for inhibition of transporters and CYPs by S-NACH, (2) Identify target
organs of toxicity to inform selection of dose in FIH study, and (3) Establish genotoxic potential of S-NACH in
Bacterial-Reverse Mutation and In Vitro Micronucleus Assays."
10879526,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Post-translational targeting and insertion of tail-anchored (TA) proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
membrane is a process mediated by the conserved transmembrane domain recognition complex (TRC)/guided
entry of TA protein (GET) pathway. Cooperating with the chaperone SGTA and the TRC35-UBL4A-BAG6 pre-
targeting complex, ASNA1 (ArsA arsenite transporter, ATP-binding, homolog 1) executes selective recognition
of its TA protein substrates, inserting them into the ER membrane via interaction with the ER-bound TRC
receptor. Patients carrying V163A/C289W,Q305* compound heterozygous mutations in ASNA1 develop
dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and death in early infancy, with no extra-cardiac abnormalities. The
C289W,Q305* mutation is a nonsense mutation/null allele, while the V163A mutation is a missense mutation.
Individuals carrying only one mutation, C289W,Q305* or V163A, do not exhibit DCM. While heterozygous null
Asna1 mice do not display any phenotypes, homozygous null Asna1 mice die embryonically. Despite its clinical
relevance and functional importance, little is known as to specific roles of ASNA1 in cardiomyocytes (CMs),
and molecular mechanisms by which compound V163A/C289W,Q305* mutations lead to DCM. To address
this, we generated constitutive (cKO) and inducible (icKO) Asna1 CM-specific knockout mice. We are also
generating ASNA1 V163A homozygous and V163A/C289W,Q305* compound mutant mice. In addition, we will
utilize human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived CM models of homozygous V163A and compound
V163A/null mutations to address their impact on ASNA1 function in human CMs. In preliminary studies, Asna1
cKO mice exhibited embryonic lethality and cardiac developmental defects. Inducible ablation of Asna1 in adult
CMs of 8-week-old icKO mice resulted in DCM with 100% lethality within 90 days post-induction. Components
of the pre-targeting complex, including SGTA, BAG6, and UBL4A, were downregulated in both Asna1 cKO and
icKO hearts, suggesting an unrevealed function of ASNA1 in the stability of the pre-targeting complex in CMs.
Together, the foregoing lead us to the hypothesis that ASNA1 plays an essential role in cardiac development
and adult heart structure and function by regulating membrane targeting of critical TA proteins and/or the
stability of the pre-targeting complex in CMs, and that compound V163A/C289W,Q305* mutations in ASNA1
impair specific aspects of ASNA1 function leading to cardiomyopathy. Accordingly, our Specific Aims are: 1, To
determine the role of ASNA1 in developing and adult myocardium by analyzing cKO and icKO Asna1 CM-
specific knockout mice for heart morphogenesis, structure and function, and the progression of
cardiomyopathy; and 2, To elucidate mechanisms by which the ASNA1 V163A mutation leads to loss of
function, and how individuals with ASNA1 compound V163A/C289W,Q305* heterozygous alleles develop
pediatric DCM, by analysis of ASNA1 V163A/V163A and compound V163A/C289W,Q305* knock-in mutant
mice and human iPSC-derived CMs containing ASNA1 V163A/V163A or compound V163A/null mutations."
10879570,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 36 people and is a highly heterogeneous condition that has limited
therapeutic interventions and affects males more often than females. Similarly other disorders like Attention
deficit hyperactive (ADHD), Tourette syndrome (TS) and Schizophrenia (SCZ) have sex-specific differences in
their prevalence and clinical presentation. However, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms that
underlie sex-specific dimorphisms associated these neuropsychiatric disorders are understudied. Our long-
term goal is to define the mechanisms that underlie sex-specific differences related to neuropsychiatric
disorders. Human genetics studies have identified high risk variants in genes that encode chromatin regulatory
factors associated with ASD, TS, ADHD, and SCZ. Our studies focus on the histone methyltransferase ASH1L
which has been identified as a gene of high importance that raises above genome wide significance in large
sequencing studies of ASD, TS and SCZ. We find that boys with mutations in ASH1L present more often with
ASD and ADHD, while girls with ASH1L mutations are more likely to present seizures. However, the molecular
mechanisms underlying sex-specific differences associated with deficits in ASH1L are unknown. We
developed a high-risk, high-reward research program that brings together in-depth clinical neuro-phenotyping
and stem cell pre-clinical studies to uncover mechanisms underlying sex-specific differences associated with
mutations in ASH1L. Our Central hypothesis is that ASH1L modulates transcriptional programs that govern
neuronal structure and function, and that sex-specific post-translational histone modifications lead to genome-
wide alteration of molecular programs that underlie male and female phenotypic differences in ASH1L related
disorders. We will test this hypothesis in the following specific aims:
Aim-1 will define the phenotypic diversity and severity of neurological presentations associated with ASH1L
disease with respect to sex-specific differences.
Aim 2 will define sex-specific cellular and molecular phenotypes caused by ASH1L dysregulation in human
neurons derived from male and female individuals with ASH1L mutations.
The impact of our work is that defining the clinical diversity and severity of ASH1L neurological phenotypes in
a male and female specific manner will be important for patients, families, and their physicians with respect to
medical treatment. Our work with patients, will allow us to uncover sex-specific differences clinically and
mechanistically using patient iPSC-derived neurons, which will allow us to identify targets for therapeutic
interventions. Finally, our work will also allow us to begin to prepare the ASH1L patient community for larger
scale clinical studies."
10879626,"Project Summary
For monoclonal antibody(mAb)-based radiopharmaceuticals to widely impact precision nuclear medicine,
strategies that both improve the convenience and reduce the radiation burden to non-target organs are urgently
needed. Compared to direct-labeling strategies, pretargeting makes mAb-based nuclear imaging and targeted
radionuclide therapy (TRT) safer, but it has yet to realize its potential impact on clinical precision nuclear
medicine. However, the modest successes and inherent limitations of existing pretargeting platforms have
defined that a successful platform needs: 1) to be nonimmunogenic, 2) designed to be modular and tunable to
any mAb and radionuclide, and 3) to avoid clearing agents. To date, no platform has met these criteria, and there
remains a critical need for pretargeting strategies to improve precision nuclear medicine.
The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop a host:guest pretargeting platform that utilizes curcubit[7]uril
(CB7) “hosts” and adamantane (Adma) radioligand “guests” for nuclear imaging and TRT with elementally-
matched 203Pb (imaging) and 212Pb (therapy). CB7-Adma host:guest pretargeting is based on nonimmunogenic
molecules, uses a modular approach, and can achieve high uptake in target tissues using mAb targeting vectors
with lag times that nullify the need for clearing agents. Thus, it is hypothesized that this platform will address the
shortcomings of other platforms yielding a translatable radiotheranostic approach to cancer treatment.
Specific Aim 1 of this proposal is the “Development and evaluation of 203/212Pb-labeled radioligands for
pretargeting.” To achieve this goal, a library of radioligands will be synthesized and evaluated in vitro as well as
in vivo, optimizing the parameters of the host:guest pretargeting approach and comparing the dosimetry to a
direct-labeling strategy in order to demonstrate the platform’s suitability for clinical translation
Specific Aim 2 is the “Evaluation of 212Pb pretargeted alpha-TRT in murine xenograft models.” Using the
strategies for pretargeting developed in Specific Aim 1 as well as a fractionated dosing approach, we will
establish the efficacy of our host:guest pretargeting for alpha-TRT. We will also compare the dosimetry,
therapeutic index, therapeutic efficacy, and radiological toxicity to analogous approaches with directly-labeled
mAbs in a mouse model of cancer to validate the advantages.
Successfully achieving the aims of the proposed studies will lead to the development and validation of a next
generation pretargeting platform that is suitable for future translational studies and demonstrate its potential as
an innovative theranostic application for TRT. The platform will be a robust, safe, and convenient alternative to
direct-labeling strategies for mAbs that is widely applicable to precision nuclear medicine in human disease."
10883755,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease characterized by death of motor neurons. A key pathologic
feature is the cytoplasmic mislocalization of a nuclear transcription and splice regulator, Tar-DNA binding protein
of 43kDa (TDP-43). TDP-43 is aggregated in cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) along with nuclear import/export
factors, and its toxicity is thought to be due to both cytoplasmic gain- and nuclear loss-of-function mechanisms.
Relocating it to the nucleus has the potential to address both forms of toxicity. Inhibiting formation of SGs is one
promising strategy, and downregulating the SG-associated protein Ataxin-2 (Atxn2) using antisense
oligonucleotides (ASOs) prolongs strength and survival in a mouse model of ALS. However, ASOs require
frequent CNS readministration, and a preferable approach would be to achieve knockdown after one treatment.
A second approach is enhancing nuclear import, a strategy with success in dipeptide repeat (DPR) toxicity
models of ALS in vitro. Extending this strategy to non-DPR forms of ALS has the potential to make a broad
impact on the disease. In addition, potential synergy between the two approaches has great therapeutic potential.
If successful, these strategies could be used to treat the vast majority of ALS.
 In preliminary work, RNAi delivered using a novel viral vector achieves robust knockdown of Atxn2 in the key
areas of the nervous system affected in ALS. Aim 1 of this proposal is to determine if sustained Atxn2 knockdown
in these regions reverses TDP-43 mislocalization and improves neuron survival in two distinct mouse models of
ALS. In other preliminary work, cell lines overexpressing a nuclear import factor show reductions in TDP-43. Aim
2 is to test if augmenting nuclear import corrects TDP-43 localization and improves cell survival under conditions
of stress. My central hypothesis is that targeting both cytoplasmic aggregation and nuclear loss of TDP-43 using
viral-mediated approaches will result in sustained neuroprotection. This work fits squarely in NINDS’ mission to
further our knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use this knowledge to reduce the burden of
disease, specifically targeting one of neurology’s most devastating afflictions.
 Dr. Amado is a passionate, highly-trained clinician-scientist uniquely poised to make a fundamental impact
on ALS. Her mentor Dr. Beverly Davidson, a renowned neurodegenerative disease expert continually pushing
the boundaries of vector-based therapeutics, and her advisory committee of deeply experienced and dedicated
neurologists and neuroscientists, will provide the guidance and mentorship to ensure her success, backed by
enthusiastic institutional support. The University of Pennsylvania, with its innumerable resources and facilities,
is an outstanding place to launch a neuroscience career. Dr. Amado will use this 5-year mentored opportunity to
build on her gene therapy training and merge it with her clinical expertise to become an independent, R01-funded
physician-scientist developing novel therapies for patients with ALS."

10913528,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neuromodulators such as serotonin and neuropeptides can exert widespread and lasting effects on neural
circuits and behavior. This mode of signaling is critical for brain function. Dysfunctional neuromodulator signaling
causes a host neurological and psychiatric disorders, and neuromodulator signaling pathways are targets of
clinically important therapeutics and drugs of abuse. The goal of this project is to advance understanding of
molecular mechanisms that regulate the development and function of neuromodulatory systems that control
behavior. For this, we study the roundworm C. elegans, whose small and accessible nervous system is endowed
with most of the neuromodulators found in the human brain. Many behaviors of C. elegans require specific
neuromodulators and are amenable to genetic analysis, which permits unbiased discovery of factors required
for neuromodulator signaling or the development of neuromodulatory systems. We have found a circuit that
combines two types of neuromodulation to control a simple and stereotyped C. elegans behavior. Chemosensory
BAG neurons release neuropeptides that potently inhibit a pair of serotonergic neurons in the reproductive
neuromusculature of the C. elegans hermaphrodite - the HSNs. Through genetic studies of behaviors generated
by this circuit we have discovered genes required for the development and function of peptidergic BAGs and
factors required for neuropeptides to modulate HSN function and reproductive behavior. In addition to serving
as a model for neuromodulation, this circuit allows us to investigate the neurobiology of animal-microbe
interactions. BAG neurons detect the carbon dioxide generated by microbial respiration, and they function in a
circuit that evaluates the quality of environmental microbes and that allows C. elegans to discriminate between
nutritive microbes and pathogens. We have linked our interest in host-microbe interactions to our interest in
neuromodulation through a study of microbial metabolites that function as agonists of serotonin signaling to affect
animal behavior. To date our studies have revealed functions in the development and function of
neuromodulatory systems for a Toll-like receptor and its associated signaling pathway, insulin signaling,
evolutionarily conserved transcription factors, and regulators of neuronal excitability. Biochemical and genetic
screens based on these discoveries continue to yield new factors, and we expect that this circuit will continue to
serve as a powerful platform for understanding molecular mechanisms of neuromodulation."
10913530,"Sober living houses (SLHs) are alcohol- and drug-free living environments for persons attempting to
abstain from substances and develop a long-term program of recovery. Studies have shown residents
in these homes make significant, sustained improvements in multiple areas of functioning, including
abstinence from alcohol. One of the strongest and most consistent predictors of relapse is shorter
retention in the house. Focus groups with SLH managers suggest peer helping enhances retention,
commitment to the household, and commitment to recovery. Building upon an ongoing longitudinal
study of SLHs, the proposed study will assess the relative impact of helping behaviors on retention,
and in turn, on relapse. Initial aims will assess how relapse is affected by helping broadly conceived,
including comparisons of giving versus receiving help and helping in relation to peers versus others
(i.e., family and friends). We will also assess how relapse is affected by giving and receiving different
types of help, such as instrumental versus emotional. The study will then test a novel path model
suggesting that, because of the overarching culture of SLHs and the innate benefits of helping in
recovery, helping others in recovery-related contexts (i.e., in the residence and in 12-step groups) will
lead to stronger relationships with peers in recovery, improved self-esteem, a stronger commitment to
abstinence, more focus on others, and improved recovery-related coping skills. We posit all of these
effects will then reinforce helpers' commitment to the residence, resulting in longer retention. SLHs
are ideal sites for the proposed study because the primary therapeutic influence involves peer support
within an alcohol- and drug-free living environment. Because the current research on the relationship
between helping and recovery focusses on alcohol problems, a current alcohol use disorder will be an
inclusion criterion. The study will include qualitative interviews to inform study procedures and
identify experiences of giving and receiving help that illuminate the path model. Individuals entering
SLHs with alcohol use disorders (N=200) will be assessed on measures of helping, social networks,
substance use, and severity of problems on the ASI. Because the rates of relapse are highest soon after
entering the houses, we will conduct baseline and monthly assessments during the first three months
and a final interview at 6 months. Significance of the study is high because SLHs and other types of
recovery residences are experiencing rapid growth and data are needed on malleable factors that
promote better outcomes. Further, this study will add to the narrowly focused literature on helping in
recovery and will be the first to illustrate the pathways by which helping influences outcomes in SLHs.
SLH providers will be able to use study findings to determine intervention points for enhancing
retention and sustaining recovery among sober living residents."

The number of people with Alzheimer’s disease is expected to exceed 88 million by 2050. Early
detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders symptoms are imperative for efforts to develop
disease modifying therapies or interventions, and are important for optimal patient care. The objective
of this proposal is to provide an accurate, feasible, and low-cost process to facilitate cognitive screening
in population health.
The aims of the R61 project are to develop and validate two complementary, automated tools to identify
and screen patients at high risk for cognitive decline. The first is a risk calculator that uses routine
clinical data to estimate patients’ risk for cognitive decline. Patients 60 years and older will undergo
formal cognitive testing, and five prior years of routinely-collected electronic health record data will be
used to model cognitive status. The Cognitive Risk Calculator will be validated in two historical samples
and integrated into the electronic medical record to help providers identify vulnerable patients.
The second tool is a validated iPad-based screening tool, the Brief Assessment of Cognitive Health
(BACH) that patients can complete independently before, during, or after their doctor appointment.
Patients will complete the BACH, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (a paper-and-pencil
screening tool), and formal neuropsychological testing at two time points. We hypothesize the BACH
will be more sensitive to cognitive change over time than the established screening tool. The BACH is
already integrated into the Epic electronic medical record platform; cognitive score and screening
results for depression, stress, and sleep disruption are automatically recorded in the patient’s medical
record for providers to document and act upon.
The R33 project is a Phase IV pragmatic clinical trial to gauge the uptake and utility of these tools in
primary care practices. Six internal medicine clinics will be randomized over time to the active study
arm (Risk Calculator and BACH). This will permit comparisons of standard of care screening practices
with screening activities following introduction of the Cognitive Risk Calculator and BACH. We will use
a mixed-methods approach to determine optimal implementation strategies across a variety of practice
models.
Impact: The EHR risk-calculator and BACH have the capacity to improve detection of cognitive decline
on a population health scale. The project also examines how regional differences in socioeconomic
advantage relate to health disparities measured in terms of cognitive risk as well as screening attitudes
and behaviors on the part of both providers and patients."
10900763,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes life-long neurological impairment, and there is currently no
effective treatment. The premise of this proposal is recent work demonstrating that afferent
stimulation paired with treadmill training can enhance standing, stepping, and volitional control
in humans and animal models. Therefore, it is critically important to understand the mechanisms
by which afferent stimulation drives motor improvement. Tools that can identify which afferents
are necessary and sufficient to enhance recovery, and that can facilitate characterization of the
helpful neural plasticity, are urgently needed. Our long-term goal is to develop approaches for
selective afferent modulation, and apply them to the dissection of the mechanisms underlying
recovery from SCI. The objective of this grant is to identify which sets of afferents are important
for recovery and how spinal circuits change to facilitate it. To achieve selective modulation of
afferents and enable genetic tracing we will use Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by
Designer Drugs (DREADDs) that can modulate excitability in specific populations of neurons. To
accurately quantify improvement, we will use Deep Learning to analyze large kinematic data
sets. Our preliminary data shows strong expression of DREADDs in large diameter DRG
neurons, that their activation by CNO can excite or inhibit the H-reflex, and that activation of
excitatory DREADDs during treadmill training post-SCI improves stepping. Our main hypothesis
is that activation of large afferents by the excitatory DREADD (hM3Dq) during treadmill training
will enhance recovery, whereas inhibitory DREADDs (hM4Di) will suppress recovery. Four sub-
hypotheses will test whether recovery is mediated by increased afferent projection onto 1) motor
neurons, or 2) inhibitory interneurons; or by sprouting of 3) reticulospinal and 4) propriospinal
circuits. Our Specific Aims are to determine whether selective expression of DREADDs in (Aim
1) all large diameter (proprioceptive and tactile) neurons and (Aim 2) large proprioceptive
afferents only can enhance recovery. The rationale for these aims is that afferent stimulation is
hypothesized to work through selective excitation of large diameter sensory afferents (LDSA)
that both drive motor pools locally and facilitate proprio- and surpraspinal input. To date, it has
not been possible to definitively determine which afferents were recruited after electrical
stimulation, or to select between afferents of similar diameter. The significance of this work lies
in determining whether recovery is mediated exclusively by proprioceptive axons or a
combination of proprioceptive and tactile afferents, and uncovering the mechanisms of
functional plasticity in the spinal cord."
10900765,"KOMP2-Phase3 Production and Phenotyping by the DTCC Consortium
 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This application will renew funding for our consortium (DTCC) to continue to participate in Phase3 of the NIH
Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Project (KOMP2). DTCC proposes to produce 600 null mutant mouse lines for
genes with little to no functional annotation or phenotype by electroporation of Cas9 RNA-guided nucleases into
1-cell stage C57BL/6N zygotes and upload all production data and information to the International Mouse
Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC)’s GenTaR database. DTCC will then generate age-matched and sex-balanced
cohorts of 600 mutant homozygous or heterozygous mouse lines and wildtype C57BL/6N control mice for
juvenile phenotyping in the Early Adult Pipeline and embryo phenotyping of homozygous nonviable mouse lines
in the Embryo Pipeline. We will use categorical and continuous tests and procedures standardized by the IMPC
and selected by balancing the breadth of phenotyping with a >4% abnormal phenotype hit rate across the IMPC
during KOMP-Phase2 to develop an informative multi-domain pipeline. After quality assurance of our processes
and quality control of our products, all data, metadata, and images will be available for upload to the Data
Coordination Center (DCC). After additional quality control at the DCC, our data will be transferred to the
Central Data Archive for statistical analysis and from there to the IMPC web portal for public access. All mutant
mouse lines will be available upon request by the research community as live mice while production and
phenotyping are in progress and thereafter as frozen germplasm and as live mice after cryorecovery from the
Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center and Canadian Mouse Mutant Resource. Additional biological
resources (e.g., fixed tissue) will also be available through the web portal and all DTCC’s standardized
operating procedures, expertise, and advice are available by email or videoconference. To continuously adapt
and improve high-throughput design, production, and phenotyping, DTCC will conduct technology development
projects to increase efficiency of production (e.g., expanding the genome editing toolbox, generating landing-
pad alleles) and pilot phenotyping tests (e.g., automated home-cage monitoring, whole-body MRI) to assess
their utility, capability, cost-effectiveness, and informative value to the Early Adult and Embryo Pipelines. In
addition to prioritizing genes with a human ortholog and no or little functional annotation, DTCC will also
actively request the scientific community to nominate genes to produce and phenotype that have likely disease
associations.
 Grant-funded member centers of DTCC include the University of California Davis (UCD; lead institution) and
The Center for Phenogenomics (TCP; subcontractor) in Toronto, Canada. We propose to leverage our
extensive experience and continue to use and refine well-tested coordinated management, strategy, protocols,
and processes established in KOMP2-Phase1 and 2. In KOMP2-Phase2, DTCC is on track to complete all
committed deliverables and complete all value-added expected activities (e.g., accelerated CRISPR/Cas9
electroporation of C57BL/6N zygotes, increased production rate of germline mutants, completion of both
production and phenotyping pipelines, and finishing of technology development projects).
 In addition to input from NIH Program Officers, DTCC will be guided by advice and recommendations of local
scientific domain experts and the IMPC Panel of Scientific Consultants. DTCC will participate in all KOMP2 and
IMPC activities, including monthly videoconferences, extant and ad hoc committees, special interest
workgroups and meetings, national and international conferences, and site visits. To maximize the scientific
output and impact on biomedical research, DTCC also commits to coordinate its efforts with those production,
phenotyping, and technology development efforts at other KOMP2-Phase3 funded centers.
 By the end of 5 years, DTCC will have contributed genotype-confirmed mouse lines and validated multi-body
system phenotyping data for 600 mutant mouse lines on time and within budget to contribute to the global effort
to functionally annotate the mammalian genome."
10900766,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chromosomes are copied by a complex holoenzyme called the replisome. Obstacles are routinely negotiated
by the replisome with auxiliary mechanisms, collectively called DNA damage tolerance pathways, that ensure
genomic integrity via on-the-fly remodeling. The aberrance of these pathways can lead to chromosome
instability and a broad range of diseases including cancer. The Schauer Lab’s long-term goal is to thus
understand the molecular basis for genetic and epigenetic fidelity, with the goal of improving the treatment
and/or prevention of diseases. In this proposal, the Schauer Lab will use a fully functional replisome
reconstituted from over 30 pure polypeptides to study how replisomes bypass obstacles that regularly occur in
the genome while enforcing genetic and epigenetic integrity across generations. They also propose to develop
whole cell lysate systems to establish active replication forks on double-stranded DNA at natural origins of
replication without the need for replication initiation on synthetic forks. DNA damage tolerance mechanisms will
be studied using biochemistry, single-molecule biophysics, and structural biology. The structural dynamics of
the S-phase damage response will be characterized, with a focus on the mediator kinase Mrc1 and the multiple
ways it regulates the elongating replisome. The Schauer Lab also proposes to study the spatiotemporal
mechanisms of rescue of lesion-stalled replisomes by translesion synthesis polymerases, and how both Mrc1
and ubiquitination of DNA sliding clamps regulates this response. When replicating chromatin, nucleosomes
present a strong block to replication fork progression in the absence of histone chaperones. The Schauer Lab
will study histone dynamics at the replication fork in reconstituted chromatin, with a focus on regulation of
histone deposition symmetry by histone chaperones and in the molecular mechanisms of various replication-
coupled histone chaperones themselves. Tools will be developed to track histone fate and dynamics at the
single-molecule level. The goal is to get a better understanding of the processes that control epigenetic
inheritance, important for maintaining cellularity during cell division. Finally, the Schauer Lab proposes to study
collisions between the replication machinery and an actively elongating transcription complex, since these
conflicts can be highly mutagenic. Transcriptional regulation by the rpb4/7 heterodimer will also be studied.
Transcription will be reconstituted from either purified proteins, or whole-cell extracts, or a combination of the
two. The Schauer Lab is developing biochemical and single-molecule tools for these projects that will afford an
unprecedented glimpse into the molecular mechanisms behind these critical processes. Single-molecule
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) will be employed to track intermolecular interactions,
allowing a characterization of the structural dynamics of these systems. Further, technology will be developed
to track dynamic motions of fluorescently labeled proteins on double-tethered DNA at the single-molecule level.
The mechanistic insight afforded by these studies will be beneficial for the medical research community."
10900794,"ABSTRACT
Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) causes life-long infection, which requires taking antiviral drugs to
control the infection. No vaccines are available against this virus. The HIV-1 cone-shaped capsid core, made up
of capsid protein (CA), protects the HIV-1 genome, plays a major role in HIV-1 infection and interacts with several
host factors involved in nuclear import of viral complexes and integration into the host genome. The myxovirus
resistance protein B (MxB) is thought to restrict HIV-1 infection by inhibiting uncoating and blocking nuclear entry,
the latter measure by 2-Long Terminal Repeats (2-LTR) circles inside the nucleus. However, MxB does not
inhibit the appearance of CA inside the nucleus of infected cells, even when infection is inhibited. Additionally,
measuring 2-LTR circles in the nucleus, which is a marker for HIV-1 nuclear import, does not correlate with
productive infection. Currently, little is known about the kinetics and sites of HIV-1 uncoating and the role of MxB
in regulating this process. HIV-1 nuclear import is also not completely understood. Several nucleoporins (NUPs),
which form the nuclear pore complex (NPC), interact with CA to promote HIV-1 nuclear import. The NPC was
previously thought to be a static structure with an inner diameter of ~40nm, too small to allow nuclear import of
the 60nm-wide HIV-1 capsid core, leading to an assumption that HIV-1 has to uncoat before entering the nucleus.
However, recent evidence suggests that NPC is a dynamic structure that may expand and that HIV-1 cone-
shaped cores can enter the nucleus. Little is known about how the NPC and MxB interactions with HIV-1 CA
respectively promote or inhibit HIV-1 infection. Therefore, I hypothesize that the NPC-associated MxB blocks
nuclear import by inhibiting uncoating and that the nuclear import of HIV-1 core requires expansion of
the nuclear pore complex. In the two Specific Aims of this proposal, I will investigate the HIV-1 nuclear import
and CA core disassembly in the presence of MxB (Aim 1) and delineate the changes in nuclear pore architecture
caused by HIV-1 (Aim 2) using advance microscopy techniques. In Aim 1, I will determine HIV-1 nuclear entry
inhibition by MxB through visualizing the presence of fluorescently labeled integrase-superfolderGFP (INsfGFP)
inside the nucleus. I will also examine HIV-1 uncoating by visualizing loss of a fluorescently labeled cyclophilin
A derivative, which binds to CA with high avidity. In Aim 2, I will examine changes in the nuclear pore size upon
HIV-1 infection using super-resolution microscopy. I will infect NUP-labeled cells with HIV-1 CA mutant, which
fails to transport to the nucleoplasm and remains associated with NPC. I will then visualize the NPC with
Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy and Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy
(STORM). This project will provide me with diverse training in virology, cell biology and advanced microscopy
techniques and will advance our understanding of HIV-1 nuclear import mechanisms. In the long-term, my work
may support development of novel antiviral drugs that can mitigate HIV-1 infection."
10900813,"Summary: Veterinarians are at the forefront of the ‘ONE HEALTH’ strategic framework, which facilitates
collaborations among human medicine, veterinary medicine and ecosystem health that are of worldwide
benefit. The vital importance of veterinarians at the human-animal interface cannot be overstated, as
graphically illustrated by the tragic repercussions of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and that 6 of 10 human
infectious diseases are zoonotic in nature. Reports from the National Academy of Sciences and the strategic
plan of the NIH Office of Infrastructure Programs (ORIP) emphasized the national need for veterinarians
trained in biomedical research to effectively deal with effects of climate change on animals and public health,
thwart the emergence of zoonotic diseases, and promote human and animal health.
We will address the national need for veterinary biomedical scientists through these specific aims:
Aim 1: Develop the next generation of independent veterinary medical researchers equipped with skill sets in
innovative and critical thinking, problem solving, robust experimental methodologies and rigorous data
interpretation.
Aim 2: Continually innovate professional development opportunities for veterinary medical scientists in
grantsmanship, science communication, team science, evidence-based mentor and mentee practices, and
forward-thinking leadership.
The School of Veterinary Medicine (SVM) and the University of Wisconsin-Madison offer an exceptional
research training environment and are ideally positioned to provide outstanding training to graduate
veterinarians in cutting-edge biomedical research. The excellent research training offered by this program is
highlighted by the (1) broad multidisciplinary portfolio of an outstanding group of trainers with a history of
sustained funding, productivity and commitment to graduate training; (2) nationally ranked multidisciplinary
research training program (Comparative Biomedical Sciences PhD program) with major strengths in infectious
disease and immunology, physiologic basis of health and disease, and developmental biology/regenerative
medicine; (3) proven ability to recruit and train a diverse group of outstanding veterinarians in biomedical
research; (4) strong research ethics and professional skills course and access to an array of
career/professional development programs; (5) commitment to minority student recruitment; and (6) strong
institutional and administrative support from the SVM and campus. We request funds to support four
postdoctoral DVM trainees per year to pursue PhD training in a 5-year period. The overall goal is to train
veterinary biomedical scientists in hypothesis-driven science who can assume leadership roles in biomedical
research, academic instruction, industry innovations, and government service in the 21st century."
10900816,"Osteoporotic fractures are common, increasing in incidence, and have a high associated economic burden.
This significant clinical problem is further compounded by a lack of therapeutic strategies to increase bone
formation and improve tissue strength. Bone formation is a function of osteocytes’ response to mechanical
loading during physical activity and exercise. Osteocytes’ purinergic signaling through the release of
nucleotides plays a key role in regulating bone adaptation in response to loading. In particular we have found
the P2Y2 receptor downregulates osteocytes’ sensitivity to loading and that the loss in mechanosensitivity is
accompanied by an increase in actin-stress fiber formation (ASFF) through cofilin phosphorylation. These
findings are significant because they suggest targeting P2Y2 signaling as a potential strategy to enhance
osteocyte mechanotransduction and increase bone formation. However, the extent to which P2Y2 influences
bone formation by regulating osteocytes’ sensitivity to loading through ASFF remains unknown. These gaps in
knowledge limit our development of new therapeutic strategies that increase bone formation and reduce
fracture risk in an aging population. Our long-term goal is to prevent osteoporosis and reduce fracture risk in an
aging population. The objective of this study is to determine the role of purinergic signaling through the P2Y2
receptor in regulating the anabolic response to loading. The premise for this study is that blocking P2Y2
signaling has therapeutic potential to prevent age-related bone loss and reduce fracture risk. The central
hypothesis states that blocking P2Y2 signaling will increase osteocytes’ sensitivity to loading, allowing greater
gains in bone mass and tissue strength in response to loading. The central hypothesis will be tested under
three specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the extent to which P2Y2 signaling in-vitro influences osteocytes’
sensitivity and overall response to loading by regulating ASFF through cofilin phosphorylation. Our approach in
aim 1 utilizes osteocyte knockout cell lines generated using CRISPR/Cas9 to examine in-vitro their response to
fluid flow. Aim 2 will determine the extent to which P2Y2 expression in-vivo contributes to bone formation in
response to loading and unloading. Our approach in aim 2 will prescribe treadmill exercise and hindlimb
immobilization to conditional knockout mice that target osteocytes’ P2Y2 expression. Aim 3 will examine the
efficacy of AR-C118925, a selective P2Y2R inhibitor, to increase the anabolic response to loading in aged
mice as well as prevent age-related bone loss. Our approach in aim 3 will treat wild-type as well as P2Y2-
knockout mice with AR-C118925 to identify off-target effects that are not specific to osteocytes. This study is
innovative because it 1) evaluates a novel therapeutic agent (AR-C118925) for increasing bone formation, and
2) uses new cell-lines and animal models to establish P2Y2 signaling as a unique mechanism to increase bone
mass. Overall, this study is significant because we expect it to demonstrate the therapeutic potential of
targeting P2Y2R signaling to increase bone formation and reduce fracture risk."
10895372,"The Administrative (Admin) Core of the Penn INSPIRE Center will lead senior and emerging investigators in
establishing, implementing, and evaluating a cutting-edge, interdisciplinary scientific agenda that leverages
implementation science to optimize suicide prevention for underserved populations. Based at the Penn
Perelman School of Medicine, INSPIRE will have interdisciplinary collaborations from the Penn Center for
Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and the Penn School of Nursing.
INSPIRE will integrate perspectives from psychology, implementation science, psychiatry, machine learning,
health economics, and health information technology. Realizing the benefit of such a rich, interdisciplinary
research endeavor requires strong and creative centralized leadership as well as efficient and effective
coordination of services, logistics, and resources. Led by Center Co-Directors G. Brown and Oquendo, the
Admin Core will be INSPIRE’s organizational, governance, and strategic-planning hub and will address three
Aims. First, the Core will provide scientific and programmatic leadership to maximize integration, rigor, and
synergy across Center components, investigators, and external affiliates. It will institute and coordinate an
internal Center Steering Committee and Stakeholder Committee and an External Advisory Committee for
transparency and input on governance, planning, and evaluation. Centralized administrative, fiscal, and
organizational coordination of INSPIRE Cores and Research Projects will be effected by an experienced,
efficient Administrative Support Team. Second, the Admin Core will ensure scientific innovation and
responsiveness to evolving research, practice, and policy needs through the INSPIRE Pilot Studies Program
that will support 10 pilot studies over the course of the Center. The Core also will establish the INSPIRE
Suicide Prevention Scholars Program to engage and build capacity of both early-stage and established
investigators who can make novel interdisciplinary contributions to the suicide prevention research evidence
base. Third, the Admin Core will amplify the impact of our research and make INSPIRE resources available
across scientific, practice, and policy communities through a dynamic INSPIRE website as well as other
targeted mechanisms for wide, multi-sector dissemination of Center findings, research tools, and other
products. Thus, through the Admin Core, INSPIRE Leadership will maximize generation of high-impact
knowledge about suicide prevention strategies designed to be rapidly deployable in a wide range of settings
serving the most vulnerable, and often disenfranchised, populations. The Core’s management strategy will
emphasize shared leadership, investigator support and mentoring, and intensive engagement of stakeholders
at every level (planning, evaluation, research, and dissemination) to maximize impact."
10903359,"PROJECT SUMMARY
‘Binding’ refers to the process whereby elements encoded by multiple brain areas are integrated into a coherent
whole during perception, cognition, and action. The elements may be perceptual (such as the color, shape,
location, motion, and texture of a visual object), but they may also include executive function and the integration
of meaning, instructions, and movements. Disruption in cortical neural binding may also be implicated in the
pathophysiology of many forms of neuropsychiatric disease, however, the mechanisms by which highly diverse
neural information is integrated in the human cortex are largely unknown. Current explanations often rely on
hierarchical multimodal convergence, or on synchronized high frequency oscillations, but these remain largely
untested in the human brain.
Several properties of recently observed human cortical ripples are consistent with ‘binding-by-synchrony’,
including their broad anatomical and behavioral distribution, phase-modulation of local firing, and especially their
co-occurrence and phase-locking between widely separated locations. Thus far, our group and others have
demonstrated that co-rippling is enhanced during memory recall in waking, and in NREM sleep, possibly
associated with memory consolidation.
The proposed study will test if cortical ripples possess other properties crucial to a possible role in binding. Aim
1 will test if cortical neurons in different areas interact more strongly when their locations engage in co-occurring
ripples by recording populations of single neurons in different segments of the cortex during spontaneous
behavior using established microelectrode technologies. Aim 2 asks if cortical rippling and co-rippling occur in
behavioral contexts that elicit binding beyond memory recall during waking, and consolidation during NREM.
To achieve these aims, this proposal includes the acquisition of novel human intracranial recording data and the
analysis of a large collection of human electrophysiology data that has grown over the last decade. This unique
dataset includes multi-hour and multi-day continuous recordings of local field potentials and single neuron firing
in multiple cortical areas in humans, using two patient groups and several micro-arrays. Together, these aims
will test if widespread co-occurring and phase-locked cortical ripples may serve as a substrate for one of the
foundational functions of the human brain: to bind disparate content into a unified experience. Ultimately,
illuminating the interactions between neurons during cortical ripples may be critical for understanding the
temporal organization of neuronal network activity, and may provide the foundation to help better understand
human cognitive disfunction."

The human polycystin family of membrane proteins consists of versatile cellular censors classified as PKD1-like
11-transmembrane (TM)-spanning receptors (PKD1, PKD1L1, PKD2L2, and PKDREJ) and PKD2-like 6-TM-
spanning cation channels (PKD2, PKD2L1, and PKD2L2). PKD1 and PKD2 were first identified as the two cul-
prits that are mutated autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). ADPKD is the most common
monogenic disorder and fourth leading cause of kidney failure. PKD1 and PKD2 assemble into a heteromeric
receptor/ion channel complex at primary cilia in the kidney where they sense mechanical and/or chemical stimuli
and contribute to the development and maintenance of the exquisite tubular architecture of nephrons. PKD2
additionally functions co-dependently with PKD1L1 at vertebrate embryonic node cilia to mediate Ca2+ influx,
which initiates a transcriptional program that determines left-right asymmetry of internal organs and the vascu-
latures. Mutations in PKD1L1 lead to development of heterotaxy, biliary atresia (BA), and congenital heart de-
fects (CHD). PKDREJ and PKD2L2, two understudied polycystin members, likely participate in Ca2+ signaling in
sperms and are crucial in male reproduction. Polycystin proteins have been historically studied using human
genetics and functional analyses in model organisms, but we still do not fully understand their assembly princi-
ples, structure-function relationships and channel properties. Furthermore, kidney cells secrete PKD1/PKD2 into
urine in form of membrane-bound extracellular vesicles (EVs), sparking intense efforts to translate total urinary
EVs as a non-invasive biomarker for prognosis/diagnosis of ADPKD but with limited success due to their inherent
impurity. In this application, our goals are to: 1) determine structures and stoichiometry of the PKD1/PKD2,
PKD1L1/PKD2, and PKDREJ/PKD2L2 complexes and define their channel properties that underlie their diverse
roles in a range of sensory processes; 2) develop PKD1/PKD2-containing EVs into an ADPKD biomarker, profile
their molecular cargo, and determine a PKD1/PKD2 structure embedded in EVs. Overall, our holistic and com-
parative studies of various polycystin complexes will clarify the currently obscure mechanistic roles of these
disease-associated channel proteins, provide a basis to understand the impact of disease-associated mutations,
and inform future efforts to develop novel therapeutics to treat ADPKD, BA, and CHD."

This proposal will develop methods to quantify the interaction of radiation with the immune system, particularly
the blood (i.e., circulating lymphocytes). We envision that future treatment planning in radiation oncology will
treat lymphatic nodes and the blood as organs at risk and include them in the treatment optimization process
so as to influence the level at which the radiation treatment impacts the immune system of the patient. During
radiation therapy, depletion of circulating lymphocytes originates mainly from (1) immediate cell killing during
irradiation of blood vessels, and thus circulating lymphocytes, within the treatment field and (2) to a lesser
extent, the radiation dose to lymphocytes residing within lymphoid organs that can mobilize their lymphocyte
population upon systemic depletion.
There are currently no whole-body computational phantoms available that can facilitate the calculation of blood
or lymphocyte dose-volume histograms. However, this tool is a prerequisite to the use of bio-mathematical
models for clinical trial design. The phantoms to be developed in this study will be the first to fill this urgent
need for the radiation therapy and research communities. In addition to the overall innovative nature of this
project, several of our methods are novel and have never been employed in our field:
• The first use of tetrahedral mesh structures to model blood vessels (SA1)
• The first implementation of a whole-body compartment model for blood flow (SA2)
• The first four-dimensional modeling of blood flow using vasculature structures (SA3)
• The first model of the mouse vasculature for pre-clinical studies (SA4)"

T cells are central effector cells of protective anti-tumor immunity, but little is currently known about these
important immune cells in human GBM. We have generated single-cell RNA-seq data on tumor-infiltrating T cell
populations from GBM patients at initial diagnosis or relapse. We used these full-length RNA-seq data to identify
clonally expanded T cell populations based on their TCRα and β chain sequences and then examined which
genes were overexpressed by such expanded T cells. This analysis highlighted the KLRB1 gene which encodes
the CD161 receptor that was previously shown to inhibit NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The CD161 ligand,
CLEC2D, is expressed at the cell surface of human GBM cells. We therefore hypothesize that the CD161 –
CLEC2D pathway inhibits the anti-tumor function of both CD8 and CD4 effector T cell populations in
GBM. Preliminary data show that inactivation of the KLRB1 gene in primary human T cells greatly enhances
their effector function in a humanized mouse model of GBM. Our preliminary data also demonstrate that several
other inhibitory receptors are expressed by substantial populations of GBM-infiltrating T cells, including CD96
and two prostaglandin E2 receptors (EP2 and EP4). Aim 1 will focus on the analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells
in GBM patients enrolled in the phase 1b NeoVax plus PD-1 antibody trial described in Project 1. These studies
will primarily focus on the expression of inhibitory receptors by T cells and their ligands by tumor cells and myeloid
cells. Expression of inhibitory receptors and their ligands will be examined by 16-color spectral flow cytometry
and single-cell RNA-seq (in collaboration with Cores 1 and 2), with an emphasis on CD161, PD-1, CD96 and
prostaglandin E2 receptors. We will investigate paired tumor samples from the same patient obtained at initial
surgery and relapse in order to determine how expression of these inhibitory receptors and their ligands changes
following immunotherapy with NeoVax plus PD-1 antibody. In collaboration with Project 1, we will also examine
the spatial distribution of T cells that express CD161 and other inhibitory receptors. Aim 2 will investigate the
therapeutic significance of the CD161 – CLEC2D pathway. We will first use a genetic approach to study this
inhibitory receptor by inactivating the KLRB1 gene in primary T cells. Blocking mAbs specific for human CD161
will also be used to examine the therapeutic potential of these findings. We will also examine combination
therapies (collaboration with Projects 2, 4 and Core 3) involving the inhibitory receptors identified by single-cell
RNA-seq in human GBM infiltrating T cells, with a particular focus on CD161, PD-1, CD96 and the prostaglandin
E2 receptors. These studies will significantly advance our understanding of T cell function in GBM and
characterize important inhibitory receptor – ligand interactions that constrain effector T cell function."
10876412,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Therapies that block co-inhibitory or checkpoint receptors (eg. CTLA-4, PD-1) have realized the potential of the
immune system to successfully fight multiple cancers, including melanoma, lung, and renal cancer.
Unfortunately, patients with glioblastoma (GBM) have not benefitted from these checkpoint blockade therapies.
This likely reflects the fact that the brain is a site of immune privilege; it has set up a state of inherent immune
suppression in order to prevent inflammation that would be detrimental to the host. This immune suppressed
state likely underlies the failure of current immunotherapies in GBM. The lack of response to anti-CTLA-4 and
anti-PD-1 in GBM raises the issue of whether alternative checkpoints are active in the GBM tumor
microenvironment (TME), which need to be identified and exploited to achieve the promise of immunotherapy
for GBM. Moreover, GBM patients routinely undergo treatment with high dose glucocorticoid (GC, eg. Decadron),
a potent immune suppressive agent, prior to surgical resection and during treatment. This raises the important
issue of whether glucocorticoid therapy plays an important role in enhancing the immune suppressed state
present in GBM, which in turn further antagonizes the potential of checkpoint blockade therapy.
We have identified that the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-27 is a key driver of a “co-inhibitory module” of genes
that contains several novel receptors that function as checkpoint receptors. Further, we have identified that both
exogenous as well as endogenous GC can promote the expression of multiple checkpoint receptors and that
GC cooperates with IL-27 to promote expression of the “co-inhibitory module” and expression of gene programs
associated with T cell dysfunction. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that IL-27 and glucocorticoid
signaling act in the GBM TME to promote the expression of checkpoint receptors and set the stage for a dominant
immune suppression. Indeed, interrogation of the single-cell RNA profiles of the immune infiltrate in human GBM
shows significant expression of the IL-27-induced co-inhibitory gene module and signatures indicating active GC
signaling. Achieving a thorough understanding of the IL-27 and glucocorticoid signaling circuits within the GBM
TME will not only provide a means to understand how GBM tumors set a state of immune suppression but also
provide a set of novel targets for improving the immune response to GBM. We propose the following specific
aims: 1) Determine the impact of the IL-27 signaling circuit in the GBM tumor microenvironment and 2) Determine
how glucocorticoid (GC) signaling contributes to checkpoint receptor expression and induction of a state of
immune suppression in GBM."

capacity building efforts, and evaluate community-academic partnership formation. Collectively, CEC activities
and resources will provide a sustainable model for and a new generation of community members and
researchers to conduct highly impactful cardiovascular health equity CEnR."
10895977,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypertension is the leading risk factor for global morbidity and mortality. Even mild elevations in blood pressure
(BP) are harmful whereby individuals with stage 1 hypertension are at double cardiovascular risk. Black adults
suffer from a higher prevalence, worse control rates, and more frequent adverse health effects from high BP.
They are also at heightened risk for an earlier accelerated progression from mild to more severe hypertension.
Little progress has been made in mitigating health inequities related to high BP. Predominantly Black cities
such as Detroit disproportionately suffer from nearly twice the national average mortality rate due to heart
disease. Mounting evidence shows that pervasive negative social determinants of heath (SDoH) are major
drivers of these inequities and represent a critical barrier to achieving BP control in Black hypertensives. Core
issues include poor access to healthcare and a burdensome system for care linkage especially in under-
resourced settings, low health education and literacy, and structural inadequacies in care delivery including a
failure to address the spectrum of life circumstances that elevate BP and hinder the adoption of salutary
lifestyle changes. In PROJECT 1 of the ACHIEVE GREATER research center, we propose an innovative
approach to identify and control hypertension at its earliest stages in undiagnosed Black adults, potentially
yielding an enormous benefit towards lifetime health equity. Using a hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation
and quasi-experimental design, we will leverage our novel mobile health unite (MHU) platform to implement a
program that links low risk Black adults with stage 1 hypertension to collaborative care delivered by non-
physicians, community health workers (CHWs) and pharmacists, consisting of a personalized, adaptable
approach to lifestyle and life circumstance (PAL2) intervention for 12-months. Core features of PAL2 include the
ability to choose from a menu of readily available interventions that address individual negative SDoH,
culturally sensitive health and lifestyle education, and adaptability over time according to its acceptance,
effectiveness (home BP), and evolving patient needs. If BP remains ≥130/80 mm Hg after 6 months, a
pharmacist-directed medical treatment algorithm will be added to achieve timely BP control. Program benefits
including BP-lowering will be assessed during the implementation (12-months) and maintenance phases (year
2) after linkage to medical care. We aim to show the effectiveness of project 1 to lower home BP after 12
months in 500 Black patients with mild stage 1 hypertension living in disadvantaged communities in Detroit and
to reach the target population. We also aim to evaluate the fidelity and outcomes of project 1 and examine its
cost effectiveness. Improving care access by strategic MHU outreach, coupled with enhanced collaborative
care, can effectively remove barriers, mitigate negative SDoH and improve BP control in Black adults with
hypertension. PROJECT 1 of the ACHIEVE GREATER center represents a novel and scalable model to
advance health equity in urban Black communities across the United States that continue to face disparities."
10895980,"Abstract
Heart failure (HF) is one of the most common, costly, and deadly diseases affecting humans. Hypertension is
the largest single risk factor for HF, accounting for over half of all new cases. Moreover, Black adults with
hypertension have a much greater risk, perhaps 20-fold, of developing HF compared with White adults.
Accordingly, early interventions to prevent HF, in particular blood pressure (BP) control, are critical. However,
implementation of effective treatments remains suboptimal among Black communities, especially in low-
income urban settings. While many factors are involved, mounting evidence shows that adverse social
determinants of heath (SDoH) such as poor access to healthcare, food insecurity, and lack of safe places for
physical activity are critical barriers to the implementation of recommended therapies. To achieve health
equity, improved strategies must be developed to overcome these negative SDoH. To better engage our at-risk
community, our team developed an innovative mobile health unit (MHU) program that uses geospatial health
and social vulnerability data to direct health services to communities in highest need, who may not otherwise
engage with traditional health care settings. Another key to preventing HF is usage of guideline-directed
medical therapy (GDMT), not only for treating high BP, but also providing medications proven to reduce HF
incidence. In particular, inhibitors of sodium-glucose transporter type 2 (SGLT2) prevent HF and loss of kidney
function in at-risk patients and recent data suggests enhanced benefit in Black patients. Yet, these are
dramatically under-utilized in Blacks, further contributing to health disparities. In Project 2 of ACHIEVE
GREATER (Addressing Cardiometabolic Health Inequities by Early Prevention in the Great Lakes Region) we
will use a pragmatic, randomized, unblinded, clinical trial to implement and test a novel intervention leveraging
our MHU platform to improve care access combined with enhanced collaborative care delivery among Black
patients with Stage A HF (defined as asymptomatic individuals with known pre-conditions such as
hypertension who are at-risk for later-stage clinical HF). The key components of our program are 1) a
personalized intervention conducted by community health workers that addresses SDoH by linking patients
with available community and social resources, and 2) pharmacist-directed therapy optimization per a
standardized GDMT protocol. This intervention will address multiple domains and levels of impact to reduce
the large gaps in care of stage-A HF patients in the Black community and prevent progression towards
symptomatic HF."
10895981,"ABSTRACT
The substantial improvement in lifespan and health span in the United States, attributable to improvements in
awareness, detection and treatment of risk factors have not translated into Black individuals. Life expectancy
among Black males remains recalcitrantly low and comparable to the developing world. Socio-economic
status, education, neighborhood, built environment, community context and behavioral factors or social
determinants of health (SDoH) account for ~80% of variance in health outcomes and cluster geographically.
Strategies to address health inequities in Black individuals must acknowledge and address SDoH. Precision
health technologies, access to care coordination and guidance on lifestyle, diet and pharmacotherapy have
traditionally been the prerogative of the privileged, but offer value, by virtue of their accuracy and co-benefits of
engagement, education and empowerment. The overall hypothesis of PROJECT 3 is that a visionary free
precision medicine approach to identify “at-risk” Blacks. and linkage to care using a pragmatic reimbursable
HUB-facilitated, community health worker (CHW) led, personalized, adaptable approach to lifestyle and life
circumstance (PAL2) intervention, will improve the triple goal of optimal blood pressure, lipids and glucose
targets. PAL2 will incorporate proven interventions including CHW care coordination, motivational interviewing,
lifestyle coaching, home blood pressure monitoring and importantly will be tunable to address high risk
patients (CAC≥100) with a nurse-dietician-pharmacist. We will partner with the Cuyahoga Metropolitan
Housing Authority (CMHA), one of the nation’s largest subsidized housing programs and Better Health
Partnerships (BHP), a Cleveland based non-profit, that offers a CHW-HUB model of care. Utilizing a Practical
Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) framework to address RE-AIM domains (Reach x
Efficacy: Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) and contextual factors, our multi-disciplinary team will test
the benefits of a tunable PAL2 intervention to achieve guideline driven targets while exploring contextual
factors that may determine the success of our intervention."

10895989,"CANCER RESEARCH TRAINING & EDUCATION COORDINATION: ABSTRACT
Training the next generation of cancer researchers and health professionals has been a central mission of the
University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC) since its founding in 1976. UACC’s Office of Cancer Research
Training & Education Coordination (CRTEC) is led by the Associate Director of CRTEC, Margaret Briehl, PhD,
and Assistant Director of Clinical Training and Education, Aaron Scott, MD. They are assisted by three full-time
staff members, including an Operations Manager, a Science Educator, and a Grant Writer. A CRTEC Council
comprised of 12 leaders of training and education programs provides oversight of CRTEC efforts. CRTEC’s
vision is to promote the development of the next generation of cancer researchers across a pipeline of learners
by engaging individuals from elementary to high-school (K-12) through junior to mid-career level faculty and
health professionals. This vision is realized through promotion of high-impact training that supports team
science approaches to prevent and cure cancer. Developing a diverse workforce of cancer researchers and
health professionals to serve UACC’s unique Catchment Area is a high priority for CRTEC. During the current
reporting period, UACC Members have led eight T32s, three R25s, and one U54 training grant that provide
cancer-focused research opportunities. The Center’s two newest training programs are funded through R25
awards with a focus on building the research skills of underrepresented minority (URM) trainees at the
undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, and graduate-level. During the current funding period, 178 mentors (165
UACC Members) have mentored 1,198 trainees through UACC-led and other institutional training programs.
Collectively, these programs engage trainees from high school through postdoctoral fellowships. Thirty-seven
percent of UACC trainees are URM. UACC trainees who have entered the workforce are contributing to the
cancer field through careers in academia, industry, government, publishing, and working as health
professionals caring for cancer patients. CRTEC’s concerted efforts are accomplished through three Specific
Aims: (1) coordinate and develop cancer-focused training and education activities across the continuum of
trainees, (2) facilitate and expand cancer-focused professional development activities, and (3) track and
evaluate the impact of UACC’s cancer research training and education activities. CRTEC efforts over the next
5 years are expected to lead to a substantially more integrated learning pipeline, particularly among URMs,
that promotes transdisciplinary, translational research and professional careers in the cancer field."
10895991,"CANCER BIOLOGY PROGRAM: ABSTRACT
The overarching scientific goal of the Cancer Biology Program (CBP) at the University of Arizona Cancer
Center (UACC) is to understand the basic biological processes that underlie cancer etiology and progression.
Our goal is to use the knowledge we generate on these processes to identify new therapeutic targets and
biomarkers and to establish interprogrammatic collaborations to bring them to the clinic. The Specific Aims of
CBP are to: (1) elucidate the basic mechanisms that control tumor-relevant cell growth and proliferation; (2)
identify etiologic mechanisms in cancer initiation and progression; and (3) determine how the tumor
microenvironment influences progression, invasion, and metastasis. CBP is comprised of 52 Members in 16
departments and five colleges. CBP Members have made a significant impact on basic cancer mechanisms as
evidenced by being the first to: (1) identify a quiescence switch in dormant cells; (2) find a link between
fumarate hydratase and ferroptosis in kidney cancer; (3) demonstrate centrosome loss as a major driver of
prostate cancer initiation; (4) decipher the underlying functional defects in cancer-specific Polβ mutations; (5)
identify a role for TDP-43 in DNA repair and stress granules; (6) identify a link between the androgen receptor
(AR) and integrin α6β1 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; (7) find a role for estrogen receptor in
suppressing mechanical-driven invasion in breast cancer; and (8) decipher how Helicobacter pylori evades the
immune system to initiate gastric cancer. Through interprogrammatic collaborations and hand-offs to the
Clinical & Translational Oncology Program, CBP Members are translating their findings by designing new
drugs to target the androgen receptor and glycogen synthetase kinase in prostate and colon cancer,
respectively; testing new Fe+ chelating agents in kidney cancer; designing peptides to target EGFR and
integrin α6β1 in breast and prostate cancer, respectively; evaluating miR130b as a new biomarker for gastric
cancer; using organoid/immune cell co-cultures to design personalized combination therapies for pancreatic
cancer; and testing cannabinoid receptor agonists to overcome bone pain in breast cancer patients. UACC
provided support to CBP through funding of pilot awards and coordination of programmatic meetings,
seminars, retreats, and workshops that foster intra- and interprogrammatic collaborations and transdisciplinary
translational research. These meetings supported strategic recruitment of 17 new faculty since 2016. CBP has
a peer-review funding base of $9.8M (direct costs) of which $2M (20%) is from the National Cancer Institute,
$7.2M (73%) from other National Institutes of Health sources, and $0.6M (6%) from other peer-reviewed
sources. This represents a 49% increase in peer-reviewed funding over the previous project period. During
the current project period, Members authored 386 cancer-relevant publications, of which 46 (12%) were
intraprogrammatic, 78 (20%) were interprogrammatic, and 187 (48%) were inter-institutional. In addition, CBP
Members filed 29 patents, of which two were issued, and mentored over 50 trainees."

the UACC Catchment Area. The Specific Aims are to: (1) advance understanding and early detection of cancer
through identification of risk factors and development of detection biomarker and imaging technologies
(Discovery); (2) evaluate novel cancer preventive agents and strategies to reduce the cancer burden
(Intervention); and (3) implement evidence-based behavioral, psychosocial, and system-level strategies to
promote health and improve outcomes (Dissemination and Implementation). CPCP Members have made
significant progress on cancer prevention and control research in the following areas: (1) demonstrated
exposure of firefighters to carcinogens that alter their DNA methylation patterns, leading to changes in policy;
(2) identified differences in drivers of renal cancer in Hispanics versus non-Hispanic Whites; (3) developed a
new highly sensitive breast-CT imaging system and smartphone confocal microscope; (4) showed that a
broccoli seed extract upregulated detoxification of tobacco carcinogens; (5) completed HPV vaccine dosing
studies that informed on WHO policy for worldwide vaccination guideline; (6) developed a highly effective
symptom management program for support of Latina breast cancer survivors and caregivers; and (7)
increased cancer screening rates in American Indians from 9% to 19%. CPCP has a peer-reviewed, cancer
focused funding base of $8.9M (direct costs) of which $6M (67%) is from the National Cancer Institute (NCI),
$2.1M (24%) from other National Institutes of Health sources, and $0.8M (9%) from other peer-reviewed
sources. Of note, CPCP’s NCI funding is 50% higher than that reported during the prior reporting period.
During the reporting period, CPCP Members were awarded $47M in 33 peer-reviewed cancer-relevant multi-PI
grants. These MPIs included 12 R01s, two P01s, one U54, and partnerships with 66 institutions across the
country, of which three were NCI-designated cancer centers. Funding includes a new P01 in skin cancer
prevention; a new UG1 grant to lead early-phase clinical trials of cancer preventive agents, one of only five
NCI-funded programs; new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cancer funding as the Arizona site for
the national Cancer Prevention Clinical Trials Network; and P42 funding to address mine waste exposures and
cancer promotion. During the current project period, CPCP Members authored 525 cancer-relevant
publications, of which 122 (23%) were intraprogrammatic, 76 (14%) were interprogrammatic, 311 (59%) were
inter-institutional. In addition, CPCP members filed 59 patents, of which 12 (20%) were issued. During the

investigator-initiated trials representing a 2-fold increase compared to the prior period."
10895995,"CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY PROGRAM: ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of the Clinical & Translational Oncology Program (CTOP) is to bring together basic and
clinical scientists to transform scientific discoveries into clinical applications in pursuit of the broader University
of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC) mission to prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer in the Catchment Area and
beyond. CTOP is a redesigned program that emerged from the long-standing Therapeutic Development
Program. After rigorous review and addition of new imaging-focused members, the renamed Program
expanded its focus from drug development to the full spectrum of translational and clinical research involving
human subjects with cancer. CTOP is structured around three Specific Aims: (1) discover and optimize new
agents, biomarkers, and imaging modalities for therapeutic translation; (2) develop mechanistic investigator-
initiated trials (IITs) for translation or reverse translation; and (3) conduct clinical trials testing the efficacy of
new or repurposed therapies. Critical advances in agent discovery and optimization in the past funding period
include the FDA approval of afamelanotide for protection of skin from sun-induced UV mutagenesis, discovery
of novel compounds for blocking autophagy and iron acquisition in tumors, discovery of numerous compounds
that modulate oncogenic signaling, and identification of non-addictive lead compounds for the management of
pain specifically from cancer or its treatment. CTOP Members have established a robust pipeline of IITs,
including window-of-opportunity and integral biomarker designs, for mechanistic translation. During the current
5-year funding period, CTOP enrolled 2,534 patients to clinical trials including 1,167 to interventional treatment
trials (233 IITs), representing a 6.8 fold increase compared to the prior period. High-impact IITs include those
evaluating first-in-class NAE inhibitor pevonedistat in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML); repurposing
bendamustine for preventing graft-vs-host disease in haplo-identical bone marrow transplant, of importance for
UACC’s Catchment Area population; evaluating NVX-108 to enhance radiotherapy for glioblastoma multiforme;
evaluating ficlatuzumab, an anti-HGF monoclonal antibody (mAb), in head and neck cancer; and evaluating
dronabinol for opioid-dependent, bone-metastatic breast cancer. CTOP’s 52 Members have a peer-reviewed
funding base of $4.9M (direct costs) of which $2.2M (45%) is from the National Cancer Institute, $2.6M (53%)
from other National Institutes of Health sources, and $0.1M (2%) from other peer-reviewed sources,
representing a 17% increase in peer-reviewed funding. CTOP Members were awarded 35 MPI grants totaling
$23.5M in cancer-relevant direct costs. These MPIs included 14 R01s, two P01s, one U54s, and partnerships
with 28 institutions across the country, of which four were NCI-designated cancer centers. Since 2016,
Members authored 386 cancer-relevant publications, of which 75 (19%) were intraprogrammatic, 78 (20%)
were interprogrammatic, and 203 (53%) were inter-institutional. In addition, CTOP Members filed 116 patents,

10895997,"COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT: ABSTRACT
The University of Arizona Cancer Center’s (UACC) rural and urban Catchment Area reaches the US-Mexico
border and spans five Southern Arizona counties (Cochise, Pima, Pinal, Santa Cruz, and Yuma) comprising
more than 1.8M residents, of which 39% are Hispanic and 2.5% American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN)—
populations with high cancer burden and disparities. The goal of the Office of Community Outreach and
Engagement (COE) is to serve as a critical bridge linking the UACC’s diverse Catchment population to the
scientific community to enhance participation in research, clinical trials, and clinical care and decrease cancer
burden. Formalized at UACC for 3 years under the leadership of Jennifer Hatcher, RN, MPH, PhD, COE is
driven by a team of multicultural, bilingual members representative of Arizona’s diverse population. The team is
advised by a diverse set of external stakeholders and community members who comprise the Community
Advisory Board (CAB) and internal stakeholders who comprise an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC). The
Specific Aims of COE are to: (1) Characterize and monitor cancer burden and cancer-related needs within the
UACC Catchment Area; (2) Facilitate impactful research and clinical trials focusing on UACC priority cancers in
alignment with the Strategic Plan; (3) Lead community outreach that synergizes institutional and community
efforts to reduce Catchment cancer health disparities; and (4) Promote policy recommendations focusing on
reduction of cancer disparities and cancer burden in Arizona and beyond. COE facilitates UACC efforts to
effectively address the specific cancer burden of the Catchment population, including priority cancers (lung,
breast, gastrointestinal [GI], genitourinary [GU], and melanoma); low cancer screening rates among Hispanics
and AI/ANs; and challenges to treatment access, including in rural and frontier areas. Disparities are
addressed through a combination of Catchment-wide partnerships; targeted community-based education and
outreach guided by an active CAB; and support for impactful, cutting-edge, innovative research. Efforts are
evaluated using a comprehensive logic model that demonstrates the impact and interconnectedness of COE
activities across the institution and community. COE efforts have included completion of a granular
characterization of the Catchment Area to support the selection of high priority cancers and establishment of a
formal partnership with the Arizona Department of Health Services. Impact of efforts includes increased
knowledge regarding Catchment-relevant cancers, grant submissions focused on Catchment-relevant cancers
and populations, Catchment-relevant programming and outreach, and connections for Catchment residents to
research and clinical services. Future directions include partnering with UACC’s AD of Population Health
Sciences to conduct a population health assessment further characterizing the cancer burden/priorities of the
Catchment Area and building a culturally responsive tool kit to enhance recruitment of underrepresented
minorities in clinical trials."
10896001,"LEADERSHIP, PLANNING, AND EVALUATION: ABSTRACT
The University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC) aspires to serve as the trusted source and greatest hope for
cancer patients and caregivers. This will be accomplished through high-impact collaborative research and
transdisciplinary translational discoveries that help reduce cancer risk and enhance outcomes. UACC’s vision
is to be a national leader for overcoming cancer risks, improving treatments, training talented scientists and
providers, and engaging communities though a shared determination to discover, innovate, and remove social
inequities. This vision is realized through the mission, which is to alleviate the burden of cancer on patients and
families within UACC’s five-county Catchment Area and beyond through: (1) a quest for scientific discovery
through interdisciplinary collaboration and team science; (2) increasing access to cutting-edge approaches to
care during a patient’s cancer journey; (3) preparing generations of researchers and health professionals to
fight each day against cancer and the inequities affecting vulnerable populations; and (4) providing national
leadership in engaging populations with respect, consistency, and shared conviction. In June 2020, Joann
Sweasy, PhD, was appointed as the Center’s first female Director. Over the project period, four new Associate
Directors and three Interim Associate Directors were appointed to the Center’s senior leadership team. Upon
becoming Director, Sweasy launched a highly engaged strategic planning process and developed the 2020–
2025 Strategic Plan, entitled Bear Down on Cancer, which will guide the Center for the next 5 years. The
UACC Executive Council, comprised of the Director and Associate Directors, is responsible for the
implementation and continuous evaluation of the Strategic Plan. Planning and Evaluation is further supported
at the institutional level by its senior leaders, Deans of Colleges, and Institute Directors, along with the UACC’s
Academic Medical Partner, Banner Health – Tucson. Progress toward meeting the Center’s strategic goals is

10896002,"CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT (CPDM): ABSTRACT
Part I: Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM). Clinical research at the University of Arizona
Cancer Center (UACC) is supported by the UACC Clinical Trials Office (CTO), which functions as the UACC
Clinical and Protocol Data Management (CPDM) resource. The CTO staffing includes 79 FTEs to support
UACC investigators conducting both interventional and non-interventional cancer clinical trials. The CTO
supports Institutional, National Clinical Trials Network, Externally Peer-Reviewed, and Industry-sponsored
clinical trials, and provides comprehensive services for the entire trial lifecycle, including regulatory support,
data management, clinical research coordination, research nursing, training and education, and technology
services. The CTO uses a centralized clinical trials management system, OnCore, to manage protocol conduct
and to provide reports and performance metrics to the Cancer Center leadership. These metrics facilitate
oversight and strategic planning and support ongoing process improvement and training needs. In the current
project period, the CTO oversaw the activation of 327 interventional trials and 23 non-interventional trials. In
the same period, the CTO supported the accrual of 6,116 participants to interventional trials, 1,259 to
interventional treatment trials, and an additional 4,857 to non-interventional trials. This included the activation
of 71 new trials and the recruitment of 3,535 participants during the 2020 COVID-19 period (2,835 to
interventional accruals of which 342 were to interventional treatment trials and 700 to non-interventional trials).
Part II: Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM). All interventional trials are required to include a DSM plan. For
UACC-led interventional investigator-initiated trials (IITs), UACC’s DSM Board (DSMB) approves and executes
the DSM plan by performing risk-based monitoring to ensure the highest levels of patient safety under an NCI-
approved DMSB charter. In 2020, DSMB conducted 91 reviews that encompassed 48 serious adverse events
across 15 trials. There were no findings that prompted an audit or trial suspension.
Part III: Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Clinical Research. UACC actively promotes the
recruitment of women and minorities. In the current review period, 3,153 women and 2,780 members of
underrepresented minorities participated in clinical trials. In 2020, among the 2,835 individuals enrolled on
interventional studies, 54% were female, 35% identified as an ethnic minority (Hispanic), and 11% identified as
a racial minority. As a major new initiative, UACC is launching its Arizona Clinical Trials Network (ACTN) to
improve clinical trial access to underrepresented populations across the Catchment Area and the entire state.
Part IV: Inclusion of Individuals Across the Lifespan in Clinical Research. UACC complies with NIH policy
on the inclusion of individuals across the lifespan in research. In the review period, 46 participants under the
age of 20 and 651 over the age of 65 were enrolled on interventional treatment trials."
10896005,"PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM: ABSTRACT
The University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC) Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) oversees
and provides independent, peer review of the scientific merit, priority, and progress of all cancer studies
involving human subjects conducted at the University of Arizona (UA). The Scientific Review Committee (SRC)
is the principal functional component of PRMS and has final and independent authority with regard to
determining which studies will be activated and when studies will be closed. It is a multidisciplinary committee
that includes oncologists, cancer prevention specialists, basic and population scientists, therapeutic
development specialists, biostatisticians, and others, that reflects the breadth of UACC research. The PRMS is
a two-step process. First, the Clinical Research Teams (CRTs) assess the value, fit, and prioritization within
the existing portfolio of studies, as well as an assessment of each study’s feasibility, regarding both conduct
and accrual. In the second step, the Scientific Review Committee (SRC) provides peer review and feedback,
ultimately determining, based on scientific merit, whether the study should proceed. The SRC has the primary
goal of ensuring that all cancer-relevant research studies involving human subjects at UA are: 1) scientifically
sound; 2) statistically valid; 3) appropriately prioritized and without redundancy. The SRC also reviews the
data and safety monitoring plans to assure that they are consistent with the risk level of the study. In 2020, the
CRTs vetted 213 studies and forwarded 113 (4 were from Dec 2019) (51%) of these studies for SRC review.
Of the studies reviewed by the SRC, 52 of studies received an expedited review due to having already
undergone an external scientific peer review. These, predominantly, were NCTN trials. The other 60 trials
underwent full committee review. Of all trials subject to full review, 109 were approved and 4 were
disapproved. The SRC also conducted scientific and accrual progress reviews for all actively accruing UACC
studies. In 2020, 85 trials were determined to be underperforming and given low accrual notices. Of these, 68
received warnings and were subject to near-term monitoring causing 20 to be administratively closed by the
SRC and 44 to be closed by PI. The UACC PRMS mission is to ensure the highest quality of clinical research
at the UACC."
10896006,"ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY SHARED RESOURCE: ABSTRACT
The Analytical Chemistry Shared Resource (ACSR) enhances the capabilities and productivity of University of
Arizona Cancer Center (UACC) investigators by providing a state-of-the-art centralized resource for
bioanalytical chemistry assays to support basic, translational, and clinical research. ACSR provides
comprehensive services from study design consultation and method development to sample storage,
preparation, assay, and data analysis. Established in 2001, ACSR offers a wide variety of bioanalytical assays
along with the capabilities to develop and validate new methods. Using cutting-edge instrumentation, ACSR
produces highly sensitive quantitative measurements of cancer therapeutics, preventive agents, bioactive food
components, nutrients, carcinogens, inorganic elements, and endogenous metabolites in various biological
specimens, as well as qualitative studies in untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics profiling. ACSR also
supports pharmacokinetic (PK) study design, data analysis, and data interpretation. Co-Directed by Hsiao-Hui
(Sherry) Chow, PhD, and Justin Snider, PhD, ACSR is supported by two staff members with deep expertise in
quantitative analysis of exogenous and endogenous small molecules and untargeted metabolomics analysis.
ACSR utilizes various mechanisms to assess programmatic needs and relies heavily on input from the
Scientific Advisory Committee and member surveys to prioritize development of services and capabilities. An
expanding repository of bioanalytical assay protocols, many of which can be readily applied to new projects,
support a broad spectrum of research projects in a cost-effective manner to meet user timelines. ACSR is
capable of performing untargeted metabolomics/lipidomics analyses with the recruitment of Snider in 2020 and
recently acquired access to state-of-the art instrumentation for such analyses. Services provided by ACSR are
essential for assessing the systemic bioavailability and tissue distribution of novel cancer therapeutics and
preventive interventions; measuring the extent of systemic and target tissue carcinogen exposure; measuring
endogenous metabolites in biofluids and tissues as surrogate cancer-risk and/or end-point biomarkers in
population-based, clinical, and translational research; and assessing metabolic changes to define the
mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis and develop new treatment strategies. During CY20, ACSR has
supported 33 investigators (70% UACC Members). Of the 8,243 hours of instrument usage in CY20, 86% were
for UACC Members. This work supported projects from 23 funded grants and three investigator-initiated clinical
trials (IITs) on cancer therapeutics and preventive interventions. ACSR provided bioanalytical chemistry and/or
integrated PK support for nine novel agents in preclinical drug development. Since 2016, ACSR services have
supported 37 publications from Member research and the submission of 61 grant applications."
10900068,"Project Summary
 Moderate exercise is often recommended to patients for maintaining joint health, due to the strong scientific
evidence showing that mechanical loading enhances cartilage formation from the chondrocytes in the joint tissue.
Despite this understanding of joint physiology, a detailed mechanism by which cartilage formation enhancement
occurs in chondrocytes under mechanical loading remains unclear. Seminal works have demonstrated the crucial
role of the mechanosensitive ion channel TRPV4 in sensing physiological mechanical loads and expressing
anabolic genes for matrix production. However, how TRPV4 is activated under such small mechanical loading
environments remains unclear, especially as TRPV4 has been demonstrated to be insensitive to direct
deformations of the cell membrane. Here, we present a hypothesis that TRPV4 activation and enhanced cartilage
formation arises in chondrocytes due to the cell volume expansion facilitated by the accelerated dynamic
remodeling of the constituents (i.e., viscoelasticity) of the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) under
mechanical loading. This hypothesis is supported by emerging evidence that cells can sense the mechanical
confinement by the ECM, wherein a dynamically remodeling ECM facilitates cellular volume expansion and thus
activates TRPV4, and that small-strain mechanical loading can accelerate the dynamic remodeling of gels and
biopolymer networks. We will explore this hypothesis through the following specific aims, by 1) exploring how
anabolic loading conditions are influenced by the viscoelastic properties of the ECM, 2) establishing the
biophysical consequence of anabolic loading on the viscoelastic ECM and the chondrocytes embedded within,
and 3) exploring the ramifications of these findings on healthy and osteoarthritic (OA) tissues. The pursuit of
these specific aims is innovative because it connects recently established physics of hydrogels to important
biological consequences in vivo, which will help us address important health questions in other biological
contexts in the future. Altogether, we will establish a detailed biophysical and biochemical understanding of
enhanced cartilage formation in chondrocytes under mechanical loading. These results will be medically
significant as they will advance our understanding of cartilage homeostasis in both healthy and OA patients,
improve tissue engineering strategies for the treatment of cartilage defects, and unravel important insights into
cell-ECM mechanotransduction overall. The project will be carried out at Stanford University, a leading institute
for medical research, and tackled by a diverse team of experts, including the trainee who is an expert in the
mechanics and viscoelasticity of soft materials, the sponsor Dr. Ovijit Chaudhuri who is an expert in cell-ECM
mechanotransduction, the co-sponsor Dr. Marc Levenston who is an expert in cartilage mechanics, and
collaborator Dr. Nidhi Bhutani who is an expert in cartilage disease and regeneration. The proposed research
and training plan will prepare the trainee for a career as an independent researcher at the intersection of soft
mechanics, mechanobiology, and biomaterials."
10900320,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neural tube closure defects (NTDs) are among the most common and severe birth defects. The long-term
goal of our research is to uncover the fundamental mechanisms of mammalian NTDs, which may translate
into applications for preventing NTDs. The most common and significant type of NTDs is spina bifida that
occurs when the spinal column does not close completely and spinal cord and/or spinal meninges may
protrude through the back. Newborns with spina bifida are viable but usually have impaired bladder and
bowel functions and paralysis of the lower limbs, which result in serious long-term morbidity and disabilities,
and even early death. The research targeted at the cause and intervention of NTDs, particularly, spina bifida
in this project is thus highly significant. The genetically modified mutant mouse models have provided
significant clues of human NTDs. Among hundreds of NTD-associated genes, Wnt family genes play key
roles in neural tube closure and abnormal Wnt signaling may cause folate-resistant NTDs in both animal
models and humans. Craniorachischisis, the severest but rare NTD with an entirely open brain and spine,
has been found in the animal models of the non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling mutants.
The canonical Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway shares several components with the PCP signaling pathway
and plays crucial roles in a wide range of developmental processes and related disorders. Our published
works demonstrate indispensable roles of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling in neural tube closure and spinal NTDs. At
the cellular level, we recently revealed previously understudied non-neural surface ectodermal cells which
form the multi-cellular rosette structures, convergent cellular protrusions, and a unique F-actin cable network
at the leading fusion site during neural tube closure. These unique surface ectodermal structures are severely
disrupted in the surface ectodermal mutant mice with fully penetrant spinal NTDs. This project is designed to
systematically address the transcriptomic landscapes and gene-regulatory networks in the surface
ectodermal cells during normal and defective neural tube closure using unbiased single-cell transcriptomics in
combination with conditional gene-targeting approaches of the integrated Wnt signaling and PCP signaling,
which may reveal novel mechanisms underlying spinal NTDs and provide a basis for developing novel
strategies to prevent folate-untreatable NTDs in human newborns through transcriptomic modulations of the
key gene-regulatory networks."

10900078,"Transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals face substantial health disparities compared to cisgender
(i.e., non-TGD) people, including increased depression, anxiety, substance use, suicidal thoughts and
attempts, chronic disease, and HIV. While gender-affirming care, such as surgery, can improve mental health,
TGD people live long and complex lives beyond gender-affirming surgery; this intervention does not alleviate
the deeply-rooted systemic stigma and prejudice towards TGD people that leads to chronic minority stress and
negatively affects their health outcomes. Furthermore, most previous literature focuses on life before or
immediately after gender-affirming interventions. To fill these gaps in knowledge, the proposed study seeks to
identify barriers and facilitators to resilience for TGD people after gender-affirming surgery. In particular, access
to care is a systems-level resilience factor with great potential to intervene upon the health of TGD people
across the life course. However, evidence indicates that TGD individuals delay and avoid needed healthcare
due to experiences of stigma in healthcare settings. Moreover, current data about access to care in this
population is insufficiently detailed. To capture the complex systems and interpersonal factors that intersect in
accessing healthcare, this study proposes a unique application of egocentric social network analysis to
operationalize access to care as a multifaceted and relational process. By conceptualizing a “personal
healthcare network” composed of the varied and multidisciplinary healthcare professionals that a person
engages with when seeking healthcare, this research will quantitatively and qualitatively describe concepts that
are often insufficiently measured using dichotomous variables. This study focuses on TGD patients’ insider
perspectives about their structures of care, centering the experiences of this marginalized population to provide
essential insights that are not available in the current literature or with previously-used methods. The specific
aims are to (1a) characterize the personal healthcare networks of TGD adults after gender-affirming surgery (N
= 100), (1b) examine associations between network characteristics and participant outcomes in mental and
physical health, and (2) qualitatively explore TGD people’s experiences of building and accessing a network of
healthcare providers after gender-affirming surgery (N = 24). These aims will be achieved by adding new
quantitative items to data collection in an existing study of TGD adults one year after gender-affirming surgery,
and then recruiting a qualitative subsample from this group for semi-structured interviews. These aims are
aligned with NINR’s Research Lenses of Health Equity and Systems and Models of Care. Through the
proposed research and training plan, the applicant will receive top-tier mentorship in a research-intensive
environment at Columbia University School of Nursing, setting them on the path to becoming an independent
nurse investigator. This research will be a significant contribution to access-to-care methods and address the
dearth of literature on TGD resilience to minority stress after gender-affirming surgery."
10873439,"The long term goal of this renewal proposal is to gain deep mechanistic understanding of integrin-mediated cell
adhesion that occurs in virtually every human life process. Integrins are a family of 24 heterodimeric (α/β)
transmembrane receptors differentially expressed in cells and tissues. Being expressed in inactive form, integrins
are activated via a distinct process called “inside-out” signaling where cellular stimulation elicits intracellular
signals to induce global conformational change of the receptors to bind extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands.
However, for cells to firmly adhere to ECM, or change shape, or migrate as required by many physiological
processes, the activated integrins need to further communicate with intracellular cytoskeleton (“outside-in”
signaling) via the formation of large protein complexes called focal adhesions (FAs). Understanding the
mechanism of such bi-directional signaling phenomenon has been the central topic of cell adhesion biology ever
since the discovery of integrins in middle 1980s. While much has been learned about the integrin “inside-out”
signaling, how FAs are assembled to mediate the integrin “outside-in” signaling still remains highly elusive due
to its complex and dynamic nature. To this end, we have been focusing on integrin-linked kinase (ILK) - a major
FA regulator and initiator of the integrin outside-in signaling. ILK was long thought to function as a Ser/Thr kinase
to phosphorylate integrin β cytoplasmic tail (CT) to trigger signaling. However, our recent studies challenged the
longstanding dogma by showing that ILK is a non-catalytic pseudokinase yet can transmit mechanical signaling
linking integrin to actin to regulate cytoskeleton reorganization and cell adhesion. Interestingly, ILK was also
shown to mediate multiple important biochemical signaling events yet much of the published data were
misinterpreted by considering ILK as a kinase with exact mechanisms being unknown. This proposal will
rigorously address this issue with a central hypothesis that an ILK-centered heterotrimer called IPP
spatiotemporally recruits distinct signaling enzymes to integrin adhesion sites and trigger signaling. In Aim1 we
will investigate a longstanding puzzle of ILK-mediated Ser/Thr kinase AKT1 signaling. Aim2 will elucidate the
mechanism of ILK-mediated small GTPase Rac1 signaling. Aim3 will develop potent ILK inhibitor that targets at
the pseudoactive site of ILK to regulate the IPP stability, which will help to deepen the understanding of the ILK
signaling events. Overall, our proposed studies reflect a strong momentum of our program towards establishing
a new paradigm of how ILK acts as a multi-functional pseudokinase to spatiotemporally regulate integrin outside-
in signaling events to promote dynamic cell adhesion and diverse adhesion-dependent physiological processes.
These studies, along with the development of potent ILK inhibitor, may also transform the diagnosis and
treatment of ILK-associated diseases such as heart failure and cancer."
10873572,"Project Summary
Colorectal cancer (CRC) has a high mortality rate due to metastasis and drug resistance. CRC cells develop
metastatic characteristics by hijacking different signaling pathways to fuel tumor heterogeneity and facilitate
cancer migration and invasion. Additionally, the metabolic adaptation supported by “oncogenic mitochondria” is
a survival strategy developed in CRC cells. Unfortunately, the above metastatic cascade is formed and evolved
during the early tumor formation and progression stages. Activation of multiple tumorigenic pathways in CRC
cells leads to a poor five-year relative survival rate in patients with colon (14%) or rectal (17%) metastatic
cancer. Current natural anti-cancer compounds such as camptothecin and vinblastine have a successful
clinical profile. However, both camptothecin and vinblastine interfere with cell division, resulting in unwanted
effects on normal cells.
We have discovered that a natural plant-based anti-cancer molecule (veratridine [VTD]) induces the
expression of UBXN2A protein in CRC cells. UBXN2A’s ubiquitin-like activity suppresses the mTORC2-Rictor
pathway and mitochondrial mortalin, two critical tumorigenic players in CRC. This project aims to develop
“smart” nanoparticles (NPs) to selectively release VTD at tumor sites at high local concentrations while leaving
normal cells minimally exposed to the drug below its toxic concentrations. Our in vitro and animal experiments
have demonstrated the anti-growth and anti-metastatic effects of VTD at the cellular level and have aided in
elucidating its mechanisms. The proposed study will investigate the anti-growth and anti-metastatic
mechanisms of VTD delivered by casein-coated NPs in patient CRC-derived organoids (PDOs) (Aim 1). A
CRC metastatic mouse model with liver tumors will confirm the anti-metastatic mechanisms of NPs-VTD (Aim
2). Our central hypothesis is that casein-coated nanoparticles loaded with VTD (NPs-VTD) suppress the
overdriven mTORC2 pathway and interfere with the oncogenic mitochondria in CRC cells. Human tissues and
a human-like mouse model of metastatic CRC used in this study will open a platform for developing new
therapeutic strategies in CRC, particularly its metastatic forms."
10873573,"SUMMARY
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causes one of the world's most deadly infections. How Mtb modulates the
host immune response in order to establish infection, persist in the face of adaptive immunity, and elicit tissue
pathology to transmit is not well understood. Mtb grows intracellularly in lipid-laden (foamy) macrophages and
extracellularly within cholesterol-rich caseum of liquified granulomas. Mtb does not make cholesterol, but Mtb
can degrade host cholesterol and use it as a carbon source. The host modifies cholesterol by enzymatically
oxidizing it to a variety of derivatives, called oxysterols, which modulate the immune response. We found that
two oxidized cholesterol metabolites, cholestenone and 3-oxocholestenoic acid, accumulate in Mtb-infected
mouse lung, rabbit granulomas, and human sputum. Mtb has two enzymes that can oxidize cholesterol and
oxysterols in this way: 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd/Rv1106c) and cholesterol oxidase
(ChoD/Rv3409c). These enzymes can convert the hydroxy residue at the third carbon position of cholesterol to
a keto moiety. We hypothesized that cholestenone and 3-oxocholestenoic acid might be specific markers of TB
infection. Indeed, in two geographically distinct cohorts, the level of these metabolites in sputum distinguished
subjects with active TB from TB-negative individuals who presented with TB-like symptoms. In addition, their
abundance correlated with the degree of smear positivity, a rough estimate of bacterial burden. Why these
metabolites are elevated during TB and the impact that they have on infection are unknown. We hypothesize
that Mtb Hsd and ChoD disrupt the repertoire of immune active oxysterols by converting them from 3-hydroxy
to 3-oxo-derivatives, thereby interfering with the host immune response. In support of this idea, we found that
mice infected with hsd Mtb and choD Mtb have altered inflammatory responses in the lungs compared to mice
infected with WT Mtb. Here, using two mouse models of TB and a highly sensitive, well-established
metabolomics pipeline that is optimized for oxysterol analysis, we will comprehensively profile oxysterols in the
lungs, establish the role of Hsd, ChoD, and host enzymes in the generation of the 3-oxo metabolites, and assess
the impact of the Mtb-induced metabolites on the host inflammatory response and disease outcomes. In addition,
we propose that the shift in oxysterol metabolites creates a unique signature of TB disease that can be used as
a diagnostic and treatment biomarker. We will comprehensively profile oxysterols from TB patients in Asia, Africa,
and South America and determine whether 3-oxo-modified oxysterols decline in TB patients when they are on
effective therapy. Thus, in both mice and humans, we will establish the profile of immune active oxysterols in the
lungs and how they are modified by TB. Our studies will have an important impact on the TB field by elucidating
fundamental mechanisms of pathogenesis and by advancing biomarker development, which has the potential to
substantially improve clinical care. More broadly, our work will provide insight to the role of oxysterols in lung
inflammation and immunity."
10874410,"Abstract:
There are no effective treatments for age-dependent neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's
disease (AD). To address this major public health crisis, the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) was
passed to “find effective interventions to treat and prevent AD and related dementias by 2025.” To achieve
this goal in 5 years one or more effective drugs are required, likely sourced from repurposed drugs that are
the basis of this application. Dementias are diseases that occur with age. Therefore, aging must be
incorporated into the drug target validation strategy to ensure that the target mechanism remains active in
aged individuals and to facilitate an understanding of the interaction between aging and AD. The recognition
of this fact led to the NOT-AG-18-051 initiative with one goal of “employing a lifespan approach to understand
the mechanisms of protective and risk factors” for AD. In this application, we formally address the goals of
both initiatives by integrating lifespan studies with an age-related phenotypic screening platform that has
yielded compounds that extend lifespan (geroprotectors), one of which is now in AD clinical trials.
 During the last decade a novel phenotypic screening platform based upon 5 toxicities associated with the
aged brain was used to identify compounds that have therapeutic efficacy in multiple models of
neurodegeneration and dementia. Surprisingly, these new synthetic compounds as well as their precursors
slow aging in mice, keeping them younger at both the gene transcription and metabolomics levels and extend
lifespan in other model organisms. The molecular target of one compound, J147, is identical to the target of a
compound that extends lifespan in C. elegans. J147 has since been used in a 'chemical biology' approach to
understand fundamental aspects of aging itself, for it engages essentially all of the known molecular
pathways associated with the geroprotectors metformin and rapamycin as well as caloric restriction. Because
of these new observations, we reasoned that by integrating lifespan studies in C. elegans with our novel
phenotypic screening platform we could efficiently identify additional new aging pathways as well as AD
drugs and drug targets. To accelerate the time needed to bring any discoveries to the clinic we will screen the
ReFRAME library. This unique library consists of 12,000 compounds developed by the pharmaceutical
industry, including nearly all that have ever been in man and those registered as investigational drug
candidates. These drugs will initially be screened in the neurotoxicity assay used as our primary screen in
previous drug discovery efforts. Positive hits will then be assayed for longevity in C. elegans. When
necessary, target identification will be carried out as we have done in the past. Finally, pathway validation
studies will be done in two very distinct mouse models of aging and dementia. This collaborative effort
between three laboratories uses a new approach to understand the relationship between aging and dementia
and the molecular pathways involved, with the likelihood of identifying new AD drugs.

10874422,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading global cause of mortality in women, with significant sexual
dimorphism in disease phenotypes. Reproductive events may play a role as women with preeclampsia (PE)
carry an approximately 2-8 fold increased risk for CVD later in life. Although shared risk factors certainly play a
role, some epidemiologic data suggests that pregnancy itself may confer some risk. One durable pregnancy-
specific physiology is fetal microchimerism (FMc), a small number of fetal cells transferred to the mother during
pregnancy, which are detectable for decades after delivery. Obstetric factors may influence this transfer, and
cellular FMc acquisition is known to be higher in women with PE pregnancies at the time of diagnosis.
Importantly, persistence of FMc cells is implicated in later-life autoimmune disease possibly due to a graft
versus host response resulting in inflammatory change. A similar mechanism may be at play in CVD
development, as evidenced by increased atherosclerosis and vascular dysfunction noted in women with a
history of PE pregnancies. One limitation of detailed assessment of FMc in later-life adult disease is the
methodology of detecting FMc itself. Current techniques rely on maternal and offspring genotyping to detect
non-shared polymorphisms followed by use of customized, cell-line based quantitative PCR assays. This multi-
step process is burdensome and often not feasible in post-reproductive years or using currently existing
cohorts of relevant diseases, such as CVD, due to lack of family samples. Current next-generation sequencing
(NGS) technologies hold promise in overcoming these limitations. The overarching goal in this proposal is
to investigate a novel pathway between CVD and PE by testing the hypothesis that women with CVD
and a history of PE pregnancy will more frequently harbor persistent FMc and at greater levels
compared to women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Parallel to this, we will expand the applicability
of an advanced NGS approach for FMc detection and quantification to catalyze important studies for
understanding the implications of this unique phenomenon in CVD and other diseases. Through these
combined efforts, I will gain expertise in CVD research and molecular techniques to better understand
reproductive origins of disease, helping to establish my career as a translational physician scientist."
10874434,"Prothrombin and plasminogen, two central hemostatic zymogens, are activated proteolytically by cleavage of an
activation loop. The newly formed N-terminus inserts into a binding pocket and triggers formation of a functional
active site. The activation products thrombin and plasmin respectively form and degrade fibrin, but physiological
regulation prevents uncontrolled clotting and promiscuous plasmin-mediated tissue degradation. The bacterial
virulence factors, staphylocoagulase (SC) and streptokinase (SK), hijack this mechanism by inserting their own
N-termini into the host zymogen pockets, and conformationally activating the catalytic site. The SK-plasminogen
complex proteolytically activates plasminogen to plasmin. Both the SC and SK complexes with the zymogens
and the mature proteases cleave fibrin(ogen) but are impervious to host antithrombin and antiplasmin, and
alternative methods are needed to zcontrol their unwanted activity. Our monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against
the SC and SK N-termini block complex formation and activity, counteracting infection-related thrombosis and
bacterial spreading in vivo. This illustrates mechanism-based mAb feasibility in an environment of increasing
antibiotic resistance. SC and SK have additional, incompletely defined binding sites for fibrin(ogen) independent
of substrate recognition, that play a role in localization. Our proposal aims to identify unique SC and SK
sequences, and conformational epitopes in their complexes with the zymogens, that promote binding of
fibrin(ogen), both in substrate and anchoring modes. Our group has long-standing expertise with SC and SK-
mediated zymogen activation, and we recently made good progress identifying fibrin(ogen) fragment D binding
to the C-terminal repeats of SC. However, interactions of the SK-plasmin(ogen) complexes with host fibrin(ogen)
are still not well understood. Our short-term goals are to define fibrin(ogen) binding, enhancement of cofactor-
zymogen reactivity by fibrin(ogen), identify binding epitopes, and develop in vivo effective mAbs that will be
added to our existing antibody arsenal. We combine our structure-function and mechanism expertise with that
of experts in mAb development (Dr. Bill Church), and in application of mouse models of SC and SK action (Dr.
Peter Panizzi). Aim 1 will define dual interaction mechanisms of the SC-prothrombin complex with fibrin(ogen),
with the goal of identifying suitable linear and conformational epitopes for blocking fibrin(ogen) binding. Aim 2
will delineate fibrin(ogen)-dependent plasminogen activation mechanisms of S. pyogenes SK variants that to
date are not well defined, with the same goal of identifying fibrin(ogen)-binding epitopes on the SK variants. Aim
3 will test our humanized mAbs targeting the N-termini of SC and SK in vivo, and select tight-binding anti-
fibrin(ogen) binding site mAbs for in vivo studies. Long-term goals for future funding cycles are the development
of mAbs that that cross-react with a wide range of serotypes and allelic variants, and may qualify for pre-clinical
and clinical testing. Cocktails of these mAbs would support the patient's hemostatic system by minimizing

Dr. Cecilia Pascual-Garrido, MD, PhD is a hip preservation and adult reconstruction surgeon whose research
goal is to make significant and meaningful contributions in the care of young adults with pre-OA hip disorders,
through the process of basic scientific discovery and its translation to patient care. Her educational, clinical and
research experiences uniquely prepare her to pursue this work, and this career development award will facilitate
the complementary musculoskeletal research training she requires, with an emphasis on epigenetics,
transcriptome, bioinformatics and statistical concepts. All activities will occur at the Washington University School
of Medicine, an institution with strong health services research program and musculoskeletal research group.
Recent reports indicate an etiologic role of Femoroacetabular Impingement (FAI) in up to 50% of OA cases. Over
300,000 individuals in the US undergo primary total hip replacement (THR) annually, with THR utilization
projected to double by 2030. While characterization of hip bone deformity in FAI has been extensively studied,
the role of intraarticular inflammation and epigenetic changes plays in this disease is unknown. To address this
need, the purpose of this project is to identify critical biologic events that are mediators of the OA cascade in hip
FAI. Aim 1 will identify a catabolic state in articular chondrocytes (ACs) from the impingement zone in hip FAI.
ACs from the impingement zone in FAI (early stage) and OA (late stage) will be tested in cultures with TGFβ and
IL-1β. We hope to characterize a catabolic state and abnormal DNA methylation in pathological cells. Aim 2 will
characterize spectrum of disease (normal-FAI and OA) through gene expression and DNA methylation profile
based. Our preliminary data shows enriched biological processes in hip OA compared to FAI. Additionally, we
will investigate that genome-wide methylation profiling in hip OA and hip FAI. We believe that integrating
epigenomic and transcriptome data will allow us to better understand how the identified loci may contribute to
OA pathogenesis. The application of ATAC-seq in OA is novel and could have tremendous clinical implication to
identify altered promoters and enhancer genes that might be involved in the pathogenesis of hip OA. Finally,
Aim 3 will characterize a small animal model of hip FAI and secondary OA. This animal model could provide a
novel opportunity to test future interventional studies for the treatment of hip OA. Through established
collaboration with musculoskeletal researchers and clinician scientists in our institution, this application has the
potential to uncover early pathological pathways associated with hip OA secondary to hip FAI, which may have
important diagnostic and clinical implications."

The long-term goal of this study is to determine the regulation and function of gastrointestinal (GI) eosinophils,
a cell associated with multiple inflammatory diseases, especially a new set of emerging chronic allergic diseases
referred to as eosinophilic GI diseases (EGID). Whether GI eosinophils exist as heterogeneous cells and
subpopulations is currently not known. This is an important subject as distinct cell populations may have different
roles in disease and during homeostasis. Understanding this subject has significant clinical implications in view
of the emerging class of new drugs that target eosinophils. Perhaps only a specific population of eosinophils
should be ablated and only in certain patients. The central hypothesis is that GI eosinophils are dynamic,
transcriptionally active cells regulated epigenetically by local microenvironmental cues and that these processes
lead to heterogeneous cell populations, under homeostatic and disease conditions. The rationale for this
hypothesis is based on the findings that eosinophils express dynamic transcriptomes characterized by distal
regulatory elements associated with histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and binding sites for the
transcription factor PU.1. We will test this hypothesis using recently developed innovations (e.g., ChIP-seq,
ATAC-seq, transcriptomics, ex vivo co-culture) that we have applied to study murine and human eosinophils. In
Aim 1, we will examine the epigenetic landscape and function of eosinophils. We will test the hypothesis that
eosinophils express dynamic transcriptomes and epigenomes under basal and IL-33–activated conditions. We
will mechanistically uncover the involvement of PU.1 as a prototypic transcription factor that regulates eosinophil
enhancer function. We will elucidate the epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms underlying eosinophil
responses to a microenvironmental stimulus, IL-33. In Aim 2, we will examine GI eosinophil heterogeneity, aiming
to test the hypothesis that murine GI eosinophils exist as heterogeneous populations defined by their epigenomic
and transcriptomic landscapes and their proteomic content and functional capacity. In Aim 3, we will examine
eosinophil heterogeneity in EGID. We will compare the epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome of human blood
and GI tissue eosinophils in healthy and diseased individuals. We will model the interplay of eosinophils with key
microenvironmental factors that are likely to influence these processes (e.g., co-culture with epithelial cells and
relevant activating cytokines [IL-13]). We are hopeful that the renewal of this grant will allow the elucidation of
the fundamental properties of GI eosinophils to continue. We anticipate that the findings from this grant will lay
the foundation for defining eosinophil subpopulations in mice and humans. The importance of this undertaking
(identifying subtypes and functions of eosinophils unique to different tissues) was highlighted in a recent NIH
Taskforce on the Research of Eosinophil-Associated Diseases (RE-TREAD), emphasizing the potential
significance of this proposal. In addition, the findings generated have the potential to advance the understanding
of EGID and a variety of aspects of mucosal immunology."

Obesity is a rapidly expanding epidemic that is arguably the leading cause of cardiovascular disease. Obese
individuals have increased autonomous aldosterone production resulting in excessive activation of the
mineralocorticoid receptor that increases the risk for myocardial fibrosis and ischemia, hypertension, and stroke.
Since mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are widely available and safe medications, autonomous
aldosterone production represents a modifiable mechanism to prevent cardiovascular disease in obesity. We
hypothesize that mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists can improve myocardial perfusion and fibrosis in obese
individuals. We propose a mechanistic clinical trial that involves deep phenotyping of aldosterone physiology
and cardiac MRI imaging to evaluate this hypothesis. Participants with high-risk obesity, defined as obesity with
untreated hypertension and/or one or more features of the metabolic syndrome, will be enrolled. Participants will
undergo a deep-phenotyping protocol to characterize aldosterone physiology, and cardiac MRI to measure
myocardial perfusion reserve (to assess coronary microvascular function) and extracellular volume fraction (to
assess myocardial fibrosis), before double-blinded randomization to eplerenone (a mineralocorticoid receptor
antagonist and potassium-sparing diuretic) or chlorthalidone (a conventional blood pressure medication and
potassium-wasting diuretic) along with potassium chloride for one year. During this year, blood pressure and
potassium will be maintained in a target range to ensure outcomes are independent of these variables. Cardiac
MRI-derived outcomes will be measured again after one year of the randomized intervention. It is anticipated
that eplerenone therapy will improve measures of coronary microvascular function and fibrosis, independent of
blood pressure, when compared to chlorthalidone with potassium. This mechanistic study is designed to
investigate a targeted treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in high-risk obesity using innovative
hormonal phenotyping and sophisticated imaging outcomes. If our hypothesis is correct, this study may justify
the early use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients with obesity to prevent or delay the onset of
cardiovascular disease, and establish a foundation for future trials to evaluate incident clinical cardiovascular
outcomes."

Entry of nitrogen into the biosphere is crucial for the development and sustainability of life, as this element is
utilized in the development of proteins, nucleic acids, and other cell constituents. Nature uses nitrogenase
enzymes to mediate the transformation of the bioinactive atmospheric N2 into more reactive nitrogen sources
such as NH3. Ubiquitous to all nitrogenase enzymes are multi-nuclear transition metal cofactors which act as the
active site for N2 binding, reduction, and transformation into its reduced substrates. Despite the foundational role
of the N2 fixation cycle to biology, the detailed mechanism of how nitrogenase enzyme metallocofactors facilitate
N2 fixation is largely uncertain. Synthetic chemists are actively pursuing mechanistic elucidation of the N2 fixation
by nitrogenase metallocofactors by using coordination chemistry to design molecular architectures which can
bind and reduce N2. Significant progress has been made in this regard, especially in terms of the reduction of N2
with mononuclear transition metal compounds, but it is in question whether mononuclear systems provide
accurate models for polynuclear metallocofactor sites. To this end, the use of polynuclear high-spin transition
metal complexes as functional models for nitrogenase metallocofactors have been much less explored. The
research program described herein involves the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of new all monovalent
[Fe3] molecular architectures which we propose could be functional models to explore the mechanism of the Fe-
Mo cofactor (FeMoco) of nitrogenase. Initially, a new trianionic, hexadentate, ligand scaffold [NPL]3- will be
synthesized which can support three monovalent first-row transition metal ions. The trimetallation of [NPL]3- with
monovalent Fe(I) will be carried out to form the proposed monovalent tri-iron complex, (NPL)Fe3. Single-crystal
X-ray diffraction, SQUID magnetometry, EPR spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry will be used to determine
the structure, spin-state, and redox properties of (NPL)Fe3. The reactivity of the new [Fe3] cluster will be evaluated
by reacting (NPL)Fe3 with simple chemical oxidants and nitrogenase substrates (i.e. N2 and CO). Compound
(NPL)Fe3 will be subjected to reactions with oxidative N-group transfer reagents or N2 surrogates to establish the
N-bound intermediates involved on the way to full N2 conversion. The oxidative group transfer reactivity of
(NPL)Fe3 will also be explored using S-, O-, and C- group transfer reagents where the proposed sulfide complex,
[(NPL)Fe3(µ3-S)]-, will be used to model the role of sulfide ligands in the N2 fixation of FeMoco. We will synthesize
mono- and poly-hydride complexes, (NPL)Fe3H1-3, which could act as synthetic models for the E4 state of FeMoco,
which is the intermediate proposed to bind N2. The reactivity of the hydride complexes will be explored with
nitrogenase substrates such as N2, CO, and acetylene and the formation of the reduced amine of alkane
substrates will be monitored. For promising model complexes, the efficacy of catalytic N2 or CO reduction will be
investigated in the presence of a suitable chemical H+/e- sources or via electrolysis. If successful, these studies
are predicted to elucidate key mechanistic steps of the N2 reduction process of FeMoco."

Many aspects of neural plasticity require changes in gene expression, either by altering transcription in the
nucleus or by targeting RNA molecules post-transcriptionally. Post-transcriptional regulation may be
particularly important for allowing neurons to regulate protein production in a rapid and compartment-specific
manner. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) influence post-transcriptional gene expression by targeting mRNA molecules
for translational repression and degradation and are known to influence neural development and function. A
growing body of evidence also suggests that post-transcriptional regulation of miRNAs contributes to
experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. However, much remains unknown about the post-transcriptional
mechanisms that control miRNA expression. One such mechanism is target-directed miRNA degradation
(TDMD), a phenomenon in which trigger RNA molecules direct the degradation of specific miRNA molecules. It
was recently shown that TDMD in mammals is mediated by the ZSWIM8 ubiquitin ligase. Preliminary data
indicate that dozens of miRNAs are ZSWIM8 sensitive in the mammalian brain, including several miRNAs that
have previously been linked to synaptic plasticity, suggesting that the TDMD pathway is poised to have
widespread effects on the nervous system. Mice with altered ZSWIM8 expression also exhibit perturbed
expression of many physiologically relevant mRNAs, including genes encoding ion channels and synaptic
adhesion molecules, further supporting the hypothesis that TDMD affects neural development and physiology.
This proposal will assess how TDMD affects neurobiology by (1) determining how ZSWIM8 influences activity-
dependent gene expression; (2) identifying TDMD trigger RNAs that drive miRNA degradation in mouse and
human neurons; and (3) establishing how TDMD influences neuronal activity and the morphology and plasticity
of dendritic spines. Collectively, this work will expand our understanding of the regulatory pathways controlling
neuronal gene expression and their downstream consequences for neural function."

Understanding the pathological changes that occur with aging and lead to loss of cellular or organ function has
implications for a wide range of age-related diseases. As other diseases and disorders are cured and treated,
life expectancy increases, and the need to increase the ‘healthspan’ is becoming more important. There is a
sterile increase in inflammation with age, known as ‘inflammaging’. This is true with brain aging and is centered
around microglia, the resident myeloid cells of the brain. Our overarching hypothesis is that microgliosis initially
protects against accumulating damage in the aged brain, but with time and Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
neuropathology, persistent hyperactivation becomes deleterious and promotes neurodegeneration. Recently, our
lab has discovered a consistent microglial induction of Major Histocompatibility Complex I (MHC-I) pathway
genes and corresponding receptors (leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily receptors [LILRs] and
paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptors [PILRs]) with age and in Alzheimer’s. These receptors are almost
exclusively restricted to microglia in the CNS and could regulate microglial reactivation. Previously, the brain was
thought of as ‘immune privileged’; however, in recent years, it has been discovered that these immune genes
are expressed in the brain, and they often have pleiotropic functions. MHC-I classically presents intracellular
antigens to immune cells to mount an immune response; however, their role in brain aging is thus far unknown.
Microglia become more reactive with age and change to more pro-inflammatory phenotypes. Our hypothesis is
that the increased expression of MHC-I and their receptors is a mechanism through which microglia can signal
cell-autonomously to themselves or cell-non-autonomously to other microglia to induce phenotypic switching to
a more reactive phenotype. Whether this is a protective measure or harmful during aging is unknown, and our
mouse model to block MHC-I function specifically in microglia will allow us to elucidate for the first time whether
this change with aging is beneficial or harmful, and this can provide an avenue for future therapies. Additionally,
this same trend of increasing MHC-I expression with aging has been observed in microglia in various AD mouse
models and human AD cases. As such, we are also investigating the role of MHC-I in the case of AD by crossing
our MHC-I knockout mouse with an AD mouse line to determine the role of this gene in the pathogenesis of AD.
Elucidating the role of these genes in the pathogenesis of AD onset and progression will provide novel insight
into the role of microglia in AD. Using a novel, temporally controlled and microglia-specific MHC-I knockout model
we will: 1) Determine if MHC-I expression regulates microglial reactivity and phagocytic phenotypes with aging,
and 2) Determine if MHC-I suppression exacerbates AD phenotypes prodromally while slowing progression after
symptom onset."

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a -herpesvirus infecting 44-100% of the population and remains a
significant cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant (SOT) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem
cell transplant (SCT) recipients. We previously demonstrated that HCMV RL11 gene UL7 targets signaling
pathways involved in cellular differentiation that are important for viral reactivation and hematopoiesis. We
recently found that another RL11 gene, UL8, expressed from the spliced UL7 transcript, is required for viral
reactivation. pUL8 shares the same N-terminal Ig-like domain with pUL7, with a longer stalk domain and a
distinctive cytoplasmic tail. Using a proximity sensor approach to identify UL8 interactome in HEK293 transfected
cells, we identified proteins in the RhoA, Wnt, and EGFR pathways. Moreover, our preliminary data shows that
pUL7 binds to UL8 and enhances UL8-mediated non-canonical Wnt pathway via Rho A. We hypothesize that
UL8 signaling is important for viral reactivation and the interaction between UL7 and UL8 shapes the intracellular
events conducive to CD34+ HPCs differentiation and dissemination into the host tissues. Therefore, in SA1 we
will define and functionally characterize the UL8 interactome in the contest of HCMV infection. In SA2 we will
focus on the cellular signaling shaped by UL7 and UL8 and how this impact latency and reactivation. Finally
based on our recently publication on FOXO3 inactivation by UL7, HCMV miR-UL112-3p and -US5-1 and
protection from apoptosis as well as preliminary data suggesting an involvement of UL8 and several HCMV
miRNA in promoting survival of HCMV CD34+ HPC infected cells, we propose in SA3 to investigate the
mechanisms of FOXOs inactivation by UL7-8 and HCMV miRNAs and the impact on apoptosis and
establishment of latency."
10899494,"BIO-BEHAVIORAL CORE PROJECT SUMMARY
The Bio-Behavioral Core represents an innovative programmatic approach for the UCSF-Bay Area Center for
AIDS Research (CFAR). During our strategic planning process with research, clinical, policy, and community
stakeholders, we identified three critical ways in which our CFAR needed to expand to meet the needs of
investigators and be responsive to NIH HIV-focused research priorities. These three expansions are in the
areas of HIV prevention, substance use research, and assessing biomarkers of behavior, such as objective
metrics for adherence and substance use. First, we now support a diverse cohort of persons on PrEP housed
at our San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) affiliate, which provides infrastructure for a range
of research inquiries (PrEP Cohort). The PrEP cohort collects survey data and specimens on participants on
PrEP (oral and injectable when available) and is nimble for add-on studies from early-stage investigators
(ESIs). Second, we will provide expert consultation on integrating measurement and intervention approaches
that are responsive to significant challenges of substance use in HIV prevention and treatment (Substance Use
Research Program). Harnessing expertise at UCSF and our affiliates, this new Program will address one of the
greatest challenges in HIV prevention and care to try to optimize outcomes. Third, the Bio-Behavioral Core
supports the development, implementation, and analysis of biomarkers of behavior, specifically objective
metrics of adherence and substance use in HIV research (Biomarkers of Behavior Program). This new
program will provide assays and interpretation of these metrics to support the PrEP cohort and the Substance
Use Research Program.
The new Bio-Behavioral Core will work closely with the other Cores and working/interest groups to ensure
efficient use of CFAR resources to address overall Center aims and crosscutting priorities of health
equity/community engagement, international HIV research, and training/career development. The PrEP cohort
uses the same data elements and infrastructure as the SCOPE cohort in the Clinical Core; the Bio-Behavioral
Core components will all support ESIs and investigators from underrepresented minority (URM) backgrounds
in the Developmental Core; and this Core will work closely with the new Housing and Intersectionality Scientific
Working Groups (SWGs) on structural determinants of health. Collectively, this new Core will provide added
value by addressing previous gaps in the capacity of CFAR investigators to meet emerging challenges of the
HIV epidemic, provide a platform for ESIs to build programs of research, and enable investigators to conduct
community-engaged work aimed at mitigating HIV and related health disparities."
10899495,"PROJECT SUMMARY FOR INTERSECTIONALITY SCIENTIFIC WORKING GROUP
The overarching goal of the Intersectionality Scientific Working Group (SWG) in the UCSF Bay Area CFAR is
to develop and advance multidisciplinary applications of the critical framework of intersectionality to HIV and
related health disparities research. Intersectionality is a critical theoretical and normative framework that
elucidates how structural forms of power and privilege intersect to create and reinforce social
inequalities. An intersectional lens provides a framework through which to design studies and analytic
approaches to examine the structural drivers of HIV and related health disparities. The Intersectionality SWG
will develop and advance intersectional approaches to research by: (1) providing scientific leadership and
community building around the development and application of emerging intersectionality methods to HIV and
health disparities research, (2) promoting collaborative, multidisciplinary, and community-engaged research
using intersectionality as a framework to address HIV and health disparities, including support for identification
and dissemination of – as well as applications for – relevant funding opportunities, (3) facilitating training and
mentoring in intersectional approaches to HIV health disparities research. The Intersectionality SWG goals are
to: host 10 monthly meetings/year (with breaks in July and December) alternating between a journal club,
works in progress workshops, and biannual scientific forums jointly held with the CFAR Housing SWG;
facilitate 6 writing groups/year resulting in 3 publications/year by Intersectionality SWG members that apply an
intersectional framework to HIV and health disparities research; launch an interactive Intersectionality Learning
Center to facilitate the formation of intra- and inter-CFAR research collaborations, amplify intersectionality-
focused publications, and disseminate information on intersectionality-focused funding opportunities; promote
the incorporation of an intersectional lens into work of the CFAR Cores; develop and implement a module on
intersectional approaches to mentoring for the CFAR Mentoring the Mentors workshop; host an annual full-day
workshop highlighting intersectionality-focused research from UCSF-Bay Area CFAR researchers and invited
guests; and increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) early stage investigators (ESIs)
conducting intersectionality research and support applications for CFAR mentored-scientist research
funding and NIH calls for applications relevant to intersectionality. The Intersectionality SWG will work
closely with the Housing SWG and other Cores, including the Bio-Behavioral Core with its PrEP cohort,
Substance Use Research Program, and Biomarkers of Behavior Program. We will also explore interest in
and feasibility of establishing an Inter-CFAR Working Group on intersectionality. Membership will
include and attract multidisciplinary researchers with diverse expertise to a highly interactive and engaged
Intersectionality SWG within the UCSF Bay Area CFAR."
10899496,"PROJECT SUMMARY FOR HOUSING SCIENTIFIC WORKING GROUP
The HIV epidemic is inextricably linked with factors disproportionately common in low-income populations,
including food insecurity, violence, incarceration, racism, substance use, post traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), and depression. Each of these factors significantly increases the risk of HIV infection, creates barriers
to testing and health care, and makes negative health outcomes much more likely. The issue at the center of it
all is homelessness, which magnifies the likelihood of every other risk factor. Homelessness and unstable
housing (HUH) have been recognized as major barriers to reducing HIV incidence and improving HIV viral
suppression for over two decades, and continue to impede Ending the HIV Epidemic goals. As the housing
crisis worsens in the San Francisco Bay Area and across the country, new approaches to health care delivery
and research aimed at improving strategies to address disparities in HIV outcomes by housing status are
critically needed. We therefore have formed a new UCSF-Bay Area CFAR Scientific Working Group (SWG),
which will serve as a hub for individuals across the San Francisco Bay Area researching ways to improve HIV
care engagement, treatment and prevention outcomes among people experiencing HUH. While there is a
wealth of San Francisco Bay Area expertise in areas critical to, overlapping and adjacent to those influencing
health outcomes in the context of HIV and housing, there is currently no forum for cross-disciplinary pollination
and collaboration. Our proposed SWG in the UCSF Bay Area CFAR will provide an environment and platform
that intentionally and regularly brings together researchers, community stakeholders, implementers, and
policymakers to explore synergies and foster collaboration.
 This new Scientific Working Group on Housing and HIV will create opportunities to share ideas across
academic disciplines, as well as between academia, the community, policy makers, and agencies delivering
services. We will provide forums, symposia and workshops to comprehensively evaluate the existing evidence
on how to improve HIV prevention and treatment outcomes among people experiencing marginal housing, and
how this research might be implemented in novel ways; identify gaps in the existing knowledge base; develop
new study ideas and new approaches to research; and disseminate work in the area of HUH and HIV. We will
work closely with other Cores in the CFAR, including the Bio-Behavioral and Developmental Cores, and with
the Intersectionality Scientific Working Group on initiatives to improve the health of those with HIV or at risk of
HIV and marginal housing. This work will extend to the international arena through the areas of migration,
mobility, and homelessness. Domestically, this novel SWG will rally expertise across UCSF and our affiliates,
including the San Francisco Department of Public Health, to work on End the HIV Epidemic goals."

10899516,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Administrative and Outreach Core.
The key objective of the Administrative and Outreach Core (AOC) of the INCLUDE Data Coordinating Center
(DCC) is to provide the integrated leadership, management, and administrative system required to fulfill the
Center’s mission of serving all people with Down syndrome (DS) by accelerating a vast range of investigations
into mechanisms driving and modulating comorbidities in this population. The AOC will guide and coordinate the
activities of the Data Management Core (DMC) and the Data Portal Core (DPC) to ensure that they meet their
objective of creating a world class resource for broad data sharing, access, and analysis.
Within the AOC, a Project Management Team (PMT) will be assembled with key personnel from three major
performance sites: the Linda Crnic for Down Syndrome at the University of Colorado, the Center for Data Driven
Discovery at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and Sage Bionetworks in Seattle. Using management and
administrative strategies successfully employed in more than a dozen multi-site DCCs, the PMT will ensure
collaborative, synergistic, and mission-aligned action across all DCC teams. The PMT will also ensure that all
activities across the DCC are highly attuned to the needs of the community of stakeholders to be served by the
INCLUDE Data Portal, which will be achieved through an open collaboration model promoting both transparency
in the DCC operations and critical feedback from stakeholders.
A key goal of the AOC is to ensure that the INCLUDE Data Portal empowers not only scientists, but also
physicians, educators, government officials, advocates, and the general public with the data access and analysis
tools required for evidence-based transformative action in the laboratory, the clinic, the classroom, the
government, and society at large. While the primary objective is to accelerate discoveries on the mechanisms
driving comorbidities in DS, the Data Portal could also have broader impacts on clinical practice, education,
policy, and advocacy. Furthermore, it will be important to also engage communities focused on the study of DS
comorbidities in the typical population. Therefore, within the AOC, the Outreach Team will implement a portfolio
of outreach strategies to promote widespread use of the Data Portal and receive critical feedback from a diverse
range of users to guide the evolutionary design of the Portal.
Altogether, the AOC activities will advance the mission of the INCLUDE Project by enabling myriad investigations
of the co-occurring conditions affecting those with trisomy 21, while also ensuring broader use of all data
generated to advance training, education, and advocacy efforts."
10899519,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Data Management Core.
The key objective of the Data Management Core (DMC) of the INCLUDE Data Coordinating Center (DCC) is to
develop and sustain data sharing pathways to fulfill the Center’s mission to study a large cohort of people with
Down syndrome (DS) to accelerate research in the mechanisms driving and modulating comorbidities in this
population. The DMC will build upon the processes and platforms we have deployed in prior DCCs to facilitate
the data ingestion and harmonization of high priority clinical, biospecimen, and molecular data identified by the
INCLUDE community. Our vision - shared and augmented by our partner teams in the DCC cores - is to ensure
that data from INCLUDE cohorts are highly accessible and (re)usable by the research community to drive
integrative and innovative approaches to DS research, and to spark insights from and within adjacent domains
with shared biomolecular and phenotypic traits.
To accomplish this ambitious goal, we will first develop a data governance structure to maximize use and re-use
of INCLUDE data in order to address disparities and improve outcomes for people with DS . Second, in
coordination with INCLUDE stakeholders, we will document use-cases to ensure the activities of the DCC reflect
the priorities and concerns of the DS community, and map these use-cases to data models and standards to
support the harmonization and interoperability of INCLUDE data. We will leverage and extend existing data
models from the biomedical commons communities, and define quality control metrics for INCLUDE data types.
Third, we will enhance our platform interfaces to support the transfer, validation, and aggregation of INCLUDE
data within our data management system. DMC personnel will work hand-in-hand with data contributors to
ensure the rapid and conformant transfer of multiple data types. Fourth, we will develop bioinformatic workflows
and pipelines for the standardized processing of INCLUDE data within an integrated and highly scalable compute
environment. Fifth, we will build and deploy a virtual biorepository to enable federated biospecimen sharing
across the INCLUDE network and the DS research community.
The DMC team - in close coordination with the Administrative and Outreach Core and the Data Portal Core - will
leverage our deep experience in data management and coordination, community building, and biomedical
research to create a world-class resource for data sharing, access, and integrative analysis that would enable
novel investigations into DS and its comorbidities across the lifespan."
10899521,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Data Portal Core.
The objective of the Data Portal Core (DPC) of the INCLUDE Data Coordinating Center (DCC) is to create the
world’s premiere discovery platform and data resource for the Down syndrome (DS) community. The INCLUDE
Data Portal will provide integrated data access, data discoverability, and data visualization alongside cloud-
based workspaces and tools to accelerate discoveries on the etiology and biological pathways underlying the
increased prevalence of diverse comorbidities in this population. As the project’s chief outward-facing tool, the
INCLUDE Data Portal will serve a diverse group of stakeholders in the DS community, including biomedical
researchers, clinicians, data scientists, educators, as well as self-advocates and their families, and the public at
large.
DCC team members at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and Sainte-Justine Mother and Child University
Hospital Center will lead the portal development, leveraging the experiences, technologies, and infrastructure
associated with the Kids First Data Resource Portal, while also incorporating DS data-driven contexts from the
TrisomExplorer, an innovative data portal for clinical data and multi-omics datasets developed by the Human
Trisome Project team at the University of Colorado. This approach will ensure rapid and successful delivery of a
state-of-the-art Data Portal for the INCLUDE Project. Moreover, we will continue to innovate on functionality to
more immediately bring in user-provided data into the portal via new pathways developed by the Vanderbilt
University Medical Center team leading the All of Us data portal. Overall, the INCLUDE Data Portal will be highly
interoperable and poised to leverage the ecosystem of cloud-based NIH resources on behalf of DS research.
In order to reach these goals, the DPC will be structured around an iterative strategy that leverages our previous
work and proven technologies. Guided by the recommendations of the INCLUDE DS Cohort Working Groups,
and in close collaboration with the Data Management Core and the Administrative and Outreach Core, we will
rapidly launch the INCLUDE Data Portal to make the data findable and accessible to the community (AIM 1),
extend the portal with integrations and features supporting DS research (AIM 2), provide interoperability with
existing and emerging platforms and applications (AIM 3), and develop new ways of empowering researchers to
bring their own DS-related data into the portal for accelerated discovery (AIM 4).
Throughout the development of the INCLUDE Data Portal, we will couple best practice software engineering
methodology with continuous user feedback to inform the development roadmap. This will ensure we meet the
needs of the community and leverage the latest technologies. Our ultimate metric of success is to enable
discoveries that will lead to longer and better lives for those with DS."

directed by the administrative core (AdC) and a senior management team (SMT). The SMT is composed of
Drs. Paul Keim (overall PI/PD), Bridget Barker, Deborah Fuller, and Erik Settles – all experienced scientific
project managers. This is an aggregate effort by Northern Arizona University, University of Washington, the
University of Arizona, the Kern Medical Center, the Tulane National Primate Research Center, and the
Translational Genomics Research Institute that will capitalize upon the strengths of each institution and will
synergistically foster a collaborative and productive scientific culture. Because it is a multi-Institutional
program, coordination and communication are essential and will be an emphasis in the AdC. All of the
individual Cores and Research Projects (RPs) will be represented on the SMT, which will provide effective
vertical and horizontal communication, and management. Weekly meetings will be held within each of the
CCRC components in addition to regular monthly cross-CCRC sessions to foster engagement and
collaboration across the projects. All meetings will be supported by video conferencing and recorded, to
lower participation barriers across the physical research locations. Slack accounts and channels will be an
important part of the management communication scheme. Financial and compliance monitoring, along with
reporting activities of the Cores and RPs, will be managed by the AdC, which includes a project manager
with business accounting support. Major services, such as publication, animal models, and travel will be
funded through the Cores to support the three individual RPs. Milestones and Timelines will be generated
for each component and reviewed monthly during the SMT meetings. Outreach activities will be assessed
and are part of the success metrics. Integral to these CCRC coordination efforts will be our program in
Development Research Projects (DRPs) that will foster early career faculty, cross CCRC participation, and
innovative ideas. The AdC will solicit, evaluate, award, and monitor the DRPs throughout the life of the
VIRV-CCRC. Outreach will include our virtual seminar program and online forums to support the Valley
Fever clinical and research communities, particular to other NIAID CCRC’s. Professional development,
training, and mentoring of students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty will be encouraged and
supported by the AdC. Scientific working groups within and across the NIAID Cocci Centers will be fostered
with the seminar series, travel funds, and joint pilot projects. The VIRV-CCRC team members will be
expected to collaborate extensively and to produce relevant and impactful scientific products, including
potentially a novel vaccine ready for clinical trials."

Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii cause coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever - VF), which is of great concern
due to recent rapid increases in US disease incidence. The overall goal of our program (VIRV-CCRC) is to in-
vestigate proteins that are highly expressed early in the VF infection cycle, when the fungal arthroconidia are
developing into spherules and endospores forming. Our hypothesis in Research Project 1 (RP1) is that pro-
teins expressed at this critical stage are key to disease progression and potential represent virulence factors.
The Animal Core (AnC) will be instrumental in addressing this hypothesis by providing new animal models for
virulence testing. In Aim 1, the Galleria (wax worm) invertebrate model that we have shown supports arthro-
conidia development into mature spherules represents a good test of virulence factors key to this step. It is
also economical and will reduce the number of mice needed for research. Nevertheless, the mouse model pro-
vides data that Galleria cannot and the AnC will provide it to confirm Galleria virulence data. In aim 2, mouse
challenge experiments will be conducted at the ABSL3 facility at Northern Arizona University. Identification of
early infection virulence factors will be used guide the identification of T cell epitopes in a T cell receptor analy-
sis in RP2. T cell recognition of Coccidioides epitopes is a key step in the immune response, which we will lev-
eraged into novel VF diagnostic tests. Both virulence factor and T cell receptor results will guide the prioritiza-
tion of advanced nucleic acid (RNA and DNA) vaccine development. RP3 will use the mouse model and a non-
human primate model to develop and test new vaccines. In aim 3, we will develop a new pig-tailed macaque
(NHP) model. Our focus on this model is due to their established VF susceptibility and the availability of natu-
rally infected colony animals from the Arizona Breed Colony (WaNPRC). The AZ macaque disease incidence
is similar to the Arizona human population and represents a valuable source of pathology data, serum, PBMC,
and other tissues. The Fuller lab (RP3) has already successfully used pig-tailed macaques in vaccination stud-
ies, achieving high antibody titers and protective immunity to other diseases. The AnC will coordinate the vac-
cine work through the naturally infected NHP population in Arizona, the Seattle WaNPRC facility for NHP im-
munization studies, and at Tulane National Primate Research Center for Coccidioides challenge studies in
NHP. In summary, the AnC will develop, provide, and support three complementary animal models: Galleria,
mouse, and NHP. Each has its distinct advantages that support the individual and overall research goals of the
VIRV-CCRC. The AnC is a coordinated effort across three institutions and four locations that leverages institu-
tional strengths to maximize productive of the whole VIRV-CCRC. As the VIRV-CCRC develops these animal
model resources, we will encourage collaboration with other CCRC and broadly with the Valley Fever research
community. High quality animal models and their tissue specimens will alleviate some of the research barriers
to developing better therapeutic agents, diagnostic tests, and preventive vaccines."

Emerging and endemic mycoses have a growing impact on human health on a global scale and little is known
about virulence mechanisms for most emerging fungal pathogens. Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii
cause coccidioidomycosis (aka Valley Fever), which is of specific concern due to recent rapid increases in US
disease incidence with a more than a 10-fold increase of reports over the last 20 years. The Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that the average cost for treating Valley fever is $50,000 per patient,
including extensive hospital stays and treatment regimes. Advanced genomic and genetic analyses of these
fungal pathogens can help improve our understanding of mechanisms of pathogenicity, support the identifica-
tion of new biomarker targets, and represent the foundational framework that is necessary for development of
diagnostic tools, treatment strategies and prevention of disease via vaccination. Currently, few specific viru-
lence mechanisms have been investigated in Coccidioides. Complicating these investigations is the lack of in
vivo data, as the biology and gene expression analysis of in vitro cultures does not replicate the infective se-
quence. We have remedied this gap by detailed transcriptional analysis of both Coccidioides species in mouse
lungs five days after infection. Based on our transcriptional analyses and existing genomic data, plus in silico
functional predictions, we have identified 26 putative antigens/virulence factors. These Coccidioides spp. tran-
scripts are highly expressed under in vivo conditions and are predicted to be small secreted proteins. Our
working hypothesis is that these proteins will be antigenic and potentially virulence factors. We will test this hy-
pothesis by creating CRISPR-Cas9 gene deletion strains. These strains will be tested for virulence in two ani-
mal models in collaboration with the Animal Core. We will further investigate these genes’ functions in both
Coccidioides species, specifically the effects on development of the parasitic structure (spherule), virulence,
and host and pathogen response in vivo using nanoString. RNAseq analysis of gene deletion strains compared
to parent strain will be used to compare transcriptional networks. Analysis of these data will provide new in-
sights into gene functions, and effectively double the number of gene deletion strains investigated for this path-
ogen, which will increase our understanding of fungal pathogenesis mechanisms. These data will be used by
the other two Research Projects to identify T cell epitopes and the cognate T cell receptors for understanding
the host immune response and possible advanced diagnostic tests, as well as to identify targets for nucleic
acid vaccines. Programming the immune response toward early infection virulence factors has the great poten-
tial to provide protective immunity to Valley Fever. In total, this proposal represents a unique pairing of ad-
vanced genomic data analysis and functional assessments in an important, yet understudied, fungal pathogen."
10899575,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The long-term goal of this K23 Career Development Award is to prepare the PI (Rachel Aaron, PhD) for
an independent research career that aims to promote adaptive recovery for individuals who survive orthopedic
trauma. Orthopedic trauma, resulting in severe injuries such as multiple fractures or amputation, occurs in
around 3 million people annually in the United States; about half of survivors experience persistent pain and
psychological distress in the year following injury, and most report substantial disability 7 years post trauma.
There is an urgent need to identify factors that underlie pain and psychological distress following orthopedic
trauma and to develop targeted psychological interventions to treat these potentially disabling symptoms.
 The broader literature suggests that difficulties with emotion regulation (i.e., identifying one's emotions
and engaging in strategies to up- or down-regulate them) and central sensitization (i.e., alterations in the
endogenous modulation of pain) lead to poor pain-related outcomes. Using a theory-driven assessment of
emotion regulation, and gold-standard, laboratory-based assessment of central sensitization (quantitative
sensory testing [QST]), Study 1 will examine emotion regulation difficulties and central sensitization at 6 weeks
post trauma as predictors of persistent pain, distress, and opioid use 6 months post trauma. Study 2 will test
the feasibility of assessing and delivering Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET) to people
who endorse persistent pain (i.e., clinically significant pain, present most days for the past 3 months) at 6
months post trauma. EAET is a novel chronic pain psychology intervention that treats pain and distress by
targeting trauma-related emotion regulation process. Trauma exposure is ubiquitous among orthopedic trauma
survivors; thus, EAET may be ideally suited for those with persistent pain post trauma. However, the feasibility
of delivering EAET is unclear due to established barriers engaging this population in mental health treatment.
 Proposed research and career development activities will take place at Johns Hopkins University
(JHU), a renowned research environment. JHU is dedicated to the success of its junior faculty and provides
unique access to orthopedic trauma patients. The PI has formed a strong team of content experts in central
sensitization (including QST), psychological intervention (including EAET), and orthopedic trauma. Immersed
in JHU's rich training environment, the PI will achieve the following career goals through dedicated mentorship,
didactic experiences, and professional development opportunities: (1) develop expertise in the assessment of
central sensitization, including QST; (2) gain foundational skills for intervention development, implementation,
and analysis; and (3) learn to lead impactful orthopedic trauma clinical research. The completion of this K23
proposal will provide the necessary training and preliminary data for the PI to obtain independent grant funding
and systematically pursue a line of research to improve outcomes for survivors of orthopedic trauma."
10899722,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Physician-scientists represent a critical component of the biomedical workforce, and are uniquely equipped to
pose clinically relevant questions that link biomedical research to clinical care. Nonetheless, the number of
physicians electing to pursue a research career has steadily declined. This distressing trend has been
particularly noticeable in pediatrics despite both basic and translational research advances and growing
knowledge that early life influences, exposures, and health status play a significant role in lifelong health and
disease. Academic departments of pediatrics strive to improve care for children, and recognize that sustained
progress requires creating and translating new knowledge about childhood disease. Pediatric physician-
scientists are central to this process reflecting that they are uniquely equipped to pose clinically relevant
questions, influenced by their experience of caring for patients, and are inimitably positioned to perform
research that directly benefits those patients. Yet in a survey recently conducted by FIS/PSDP leaders, 94% of
Chairs of Pediatrics across the US see the decline of physician-scientists as a “very significant” focus of
concern. Further, of direct relevance to this meeting, approximately 40% of Chairs commented that they have
a shortage of mentors, particularly women and URiM trainees, to even effectively expose trainees to the
diverse range of scientific careers and diversity of physician scientist role models. Therefore, a major goal of
this meeting is to help in addressing this gap for all pediatric physician-scientists, but particularly women and
URiM trainees.
Recent data demonstrates a clear association between early research exposure and the subsequent pursuit of
subspecialty fellowship and intensive research training leading to a career in academic medicine.] In this
renewal R13 application, we propose to support residents-in-training to attend the annual FIS conferences
which is an intensive 1.5-day meeting that: 1) addresses an unmet workforce need by focusing on the pediatric
physician-scientist pipeline at the mid-residency level with an emphasis on recruiting women and diversity
scholars while also expanding the overall program; 2) provides integration with the NICHD K12-funded, highly
successful Pediatric Scientist Development Program (PSDP) Fellowship program that provides a model for
broad workforce expansion; 3) has intentional inclusion of diverse senior pediatrician researchers as speakers
and broad breadth of T0-T4 science in the program; 4) engages all ~145 Department of Pediatrics Chairs in
the US within Schools of Medicine, 5) provides for the first time longitudinal mentorship to physician-scientists
trainees of the R13 program, 6) measures feedback from trainees, and 7) longitudinally evaluates the impact
by following professional development of trainees for no less than seven years."
10898186,"Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a major cholestatic liver disease with high morbidity and mortality.
Inflammation and fibrotic injury of the bile ducts due to impairment of bile formation or flow represent the major
characteristics of PSC. A large fraction ( about 98%) of the transcribed mammalian genome is noncoding RNAs
(ncRNAs), including long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNA (circRNAs), and microRNA (miRNAs).
However, the biological functions of ncRNAs remain largely unknown. As the first identified and well-
characterized lncRNA, aberrant expression of lncRNA H19 has been associated with numerous human diseases,
including liver diseases. CircRNAs are a large emerging class of ncRNAs that are important regulators of various
physiological and pathological processes. Recent advances in high-throughput RNA sequencing and circRNA-
specific bioinformatics algorithms have identified thousands of circRNAs with tissue-specific expression patterns.
However, the relevance and function of circRNAs in disease, especially in liver diseases, remain to be
determined and is the focus of this new application. We reported that aberrant expression of H19 is associated
with the severity of cholestatic liver injury in Mdr2-/- mice. Our new preliminary data showed that 1) Key genes
involved in inflammation, fibrosis, and senescence, as well as sphingolipid metabolism, were upregulated in both
bile duct ligation (BDL)-mice and Mdr2-/- mice; 2) The number of cholangiocytes, pro-inflammatory macrophages
and activated stellate cells were significantly increased, while the number of Kupffer cells (KCs) was significantly
reduced in Mdr2-/- mice; 3) Deletion of H19 reduced cholestatic liver injury in both BDL and Mdr2-/- mice; 4) The
deletion of RNA binding protein HuR (human antigen R) upregulated H1926. 5) Arraystar circRNAseq identified
33 overlapping circRNAs, which were significantly upregulated in Mdr2-/- mice and downregulated in Mdr2-/-/H19-
/- mice. Among them, mmu_circRNA_26644 (circRNA-Edil3) and mmu_circRNA_19966 (circAff3) are among
the most significantly regulated circRNAs by H19; 7) Sequence analysis suggested that circRNA-Edil3 and
circAff3 may serve as a ""sponge"" for miRNA-215-3p, miRNA-129-5p, miRNA-212-5p, and miRNA-185-3p; 5)
Previous studies have shown that these miRNAs inhibit HSC activation and suppress fibrogenic signaling
pathways by targeting high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), Edil3 and Aff3. Based on our published results
and a large amount of exciting new preliminary data, we HYPOTHESIZE that H19-induced upregulation of
circRNAs plays a critical role in cholestatic liver fibrosis by sequestering miRNAs and HuR. Two specific
aims are proposed to test our hypothesis. Aim 1 is to examine the role of H19-induced upregulation of
circRNAs (circEdil3 & circAff3) in regulating cholangiocyte proliferation, senescence and hepatic
inflammation. Aim 2 is to identify the mechanisms by which H19-induced circRNAs promote cholestatic
liver injury. Completion of our proposed studies will elucidate the potential cellular/molecular mechanisms
involved in the progression of cholestatic liver diseases and identify novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets."
10898433,"The primary cilium is a sensory organelle, found on most types of cells in vertebrates, which is required
for many of the key cellular signaling pathways. Mutations in genes involved in primary cilia formation
and function produce genetic disorders termed ciliopathies, affecting multiple organ systems. Renal
disease is a prominent feature of many ciliopathies, as defects in the primary cilia of the polarized renal
epithelial cells lead to variety of pathologies, including development of kidney cysts and loss of kidney
function. Despite the importance of apical cilia in kidney function, we still understand little about the
molecular machinery governing apical cilia formation in polarized renal epithelia. Our work during
previous funding cycle identified Rab19 as an important coordinator between cilia formation and epithelia
polarization. We have shown that Rab19 is present at the ciliated centrosome (also known as basal
body) where it regulates several stages of cilia formation, including the docking of the basal body at the
apical plasma membrane, as well as extension of ciliary axoneme.
 Despite advances in our understanding of the mechanisms mediating cilia formation in polarized
epithelial cells, many questions remain. How do epithelial cells coordinate polarization and formation of
apical structures such as cilia? How does Rab19 regulate apical cilia formation? Finally, how cilia
formation and function is disrupted in renal disorders such as polycystic kidney disease (PKD)? To start
addressing these pivotal questions we used proteomic analysis to identify TTLL12 as a Rab19-
interacting protein. Importantly, we also have shown that TTLL12 is required for cilia formation in
polarized renal epithelia, while having little effect on ciliation in non-polarized cells. TTLL12 belongs to a
family of tubulin tyrosine ligase like (TTLL) proteins. TTLL family proteins mediate secondary modification
of - and -tubulin by catalyzing tyrosination, glutamylation, or glycylation. These secondary
modifications comprise so called “tubulin code”, that affects microtubule stability, polymerization and
function. Interestingly, the enzymatic activity of TTLL12 remained unclear since it was shown to have
little effect on tubulin tyrosination, glutamylation, and glycylation. Our recent studies suggest that TTLL12
may be tubulin-specific methylase, and that tubulin methylation may play and important role in regulating
microtubule dynamics. Thus, based on our studies, we hypothesize that: Rab19-TTLL12 complex
regulates apical cilia formation and function in polarized renal epithelial cells, possibly by
mediating tubulin methylation. To test this hypothesis in vitro and in vivo we will first determine
the role of TTLL12 in regulating microtubule dynamics and stability (aim#1). Additionally, we will
determine the role of Rab19 and TTLL12 during apical cilia formation in renal polarized epithelial cells in
vitro and in vivo (aim#2)."

Adolescent alcohol use is a national health problem. It is associated with negative health outcomes, such as
addiction and cognitive dysfunction, but relatively little is known about the mechanisms underlying sex
differences in adolescent binge drinking and changes in cortical circuits involved in brain health and psychiatric
conditions. In our mouse model of adolescent alcohol consumption (Drinking in the Dark, or DID), we have
observed sex-dependent changes in exploratory behaviors that are associated with dysregulation of somatostatin
(SST) neuronal signaling in the prelimbic cortex. Here I propose to investigate 1) the contributions of L-type
calcium channels (LTCCs) as a mechanism through which SST cells are altered due to drinking and 2) the
temporal relationship between altered SST cell activity and observed behavioral deficits. Male and female
transgenic mice with fluorescently tagged SST cells with undergo DID prior to brain collection. Functional
changes in LTCCs on SST cells will be assessed using patch-clamp electrophysiology, and LTCCs as a druggable
targets will be explored with behavioral pharmacology. I will then use freely moving single-photon neuroimaging
during homecage and behavioral test conditions following DID. Using this technique, we will observe the precise
temporal relationship between SST cell activity and the expression of exploratory behaviors in vivo. This research
will be guided by my mentorship team, which has extensive experience in electrophysiology and in vivo imaging
techniques, as well as experience in postdoctoral mentorship. Thus, conducting the proposed research will
simultaneously advance our understanding of the neurobiology impacted by adolescent alcohol exposure and
provide me with valuable training by qualified mentors, preparing me for an academic career in alcohol research."

Ample evidence suggests that Black parents are the most salient figures in the lives of Black adolescents, with
the greatest potential to protect and prepare them from the adverse effects of racism through unique, culturally
specific parenting strategies.33, 45 Racism is increasingly becoming a public health concern which poses a risk
for an increase in depression symptoms among Black Americans during adolescence and with recent studies
indicating that Black fathers are salient and active participants in the parenting process.5, 25, 39 However, our
understanding of patterns of parenting strategies among Black fathers is methodological limitations in
longitudinal explorations and person-centered approaches to advance our understanding of the long-term
effects of exposure to racism on depression symptomatology. The overall goal of this NRSA proposal is to
provide a methodologically rigorous examination of the heterogeneity of Black fathers’ parenting strategies and
its protective capabilities on the long-term consequences of racism experiences on depression symptomatology
among Black adolescents by 1) investigating the longitudinal stability of paternal strategies subgroups, 2)
examining the concurrent and longitudinal associations with depression symptoms, and 3) exploring the
mediational and protection effects paternal strategies in the face of racism experiences among Black
adolescents. This goal aligns with NICHD’s priority of understanding the impact of adverse experiences during
childhood and adolescence on development and identifying periods where intervention could have optimal
effects. These aims will be addressed through secondary data analysis including self-identified Black
adolescents (i.e., ages 10 -19): (1) Fathers And Mothers In the Lives of Youth (FAMILY) and (2)
Representations of Fatherhood: Roles, Awareness, and Meaning (ReFRAME). The specific aims are to 1)
Identify heterogeneous profiles of cultural parenting strategies among Black fathers, 2) Test for the longitudinal
stability of heterogeneous profiles of cultural parenting strategies among Black Fathers, 3) To examine the
direct and indirect effects of Black fathers’ parenting strategies on the effects of Black adolescents’ racism
exposure and depression symptoms, and Exploratory Aim) To examine the attenuating effects of latent clusters
of Black fathers’ parenting strategies on the effects of racism exposure on depression symptoms. Anticipated
findings can inform child development research across adolescence, a critical developmental period, and one
of five key goals outlined in the current strategic plan of the NICHD. Moreover, the research and training
outlined in this NRSA F32 postdoctoral fellowship application will equip me with the skills and support needed
to pursue a successful career as an independent research scientist by providing me with knowledge of relevant
theoretical models of parenting strategies among Black fathers and familial experiences of Black families,
competencies in longitudinal and person-centered approaches, and further develop my scientific writing,
grant-writing, and presentation skills."

The overall goal of this project is to develop a novel oncolytic viral therapy for Glioblastoma (GBM). GBM is the
most lethal and frequent primary adult brain tumor with median overall survival of less than 21 months. Around
80 percent of GBM patients experience one or more seizures. Interestingly, every fourth case of GBM is
diagnosed after the first sign of seizure as the presenting symptom. We already observed seizures in our GBM
mice models and will evaluate seizure frequency in untreated and oHSV treated GBM mice as described.
Here we propose to create an Oncolytic virus that can show improved efficacy alone and in combination with
radiation and Temozolomide. Further we believe that the proposed virus may also help alleviate glioma
associated epilepsy and can improve quality of life for patients.
Oncolytic viral therapy works by lysing tumor cells as well as activating antitumor immunity. In our preliminary
results, we created an oHSV that is armed with PTENα (oP10/ oHSVP10). This virus blocks PI3K/AKT signaling
and has increased therapeutic efficacy that is dependent on T cell activation (Russell et al Nat. Commun. 2018).
Long-term survivors in this study rejected subsequent challenge and the therapeutic benefit was lost when mice
were depleted of T cells. WE have been investigating changes induced by oP10 in the tumor and tumor micro-
environment to explore opportunities to improve the therapeutic index of this virus for GBM. Our studies show
that oP10 induces secretion of Hylauronic acid, which forms the major extracellular matrix (ECM) in the brain.
To investigate the impact of this on virotherapy we have created a second virus called ox44 that can block HA
induced signaling in brain tumors. Here we will evaluate the impact of combining these two strategies on
therapeutic efficacy: Anti-tumor killing and immunity alone ( ), and in combination with radiation and
Temozolomide ( ). Our studies further show that this strategy can reduce the expression of xCT, a

transporter implicated in glutamate release. Extracellular glutamate has been shown to induce glioma growth
and epilepsy, thus we hypothesize that this strategy will reduce extracellular glutamate and also reduce glioma
induced epileptic seizures. We will thus collaborate with Dr. Deak at Augusta University to evaluate the impact
of this strategy on glioma induced epilepsy (
Aim 3

10902979,"Project Abstract / Summary
Emerin (EMD) gene mutations cause Emery Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy type I (EDMD1), a disease
characterized by skeletal muscle wasting and life-threatening atrial defects. However, the mechanism of emerin
dysfunction in the heart is unknown. In this proposal, I seek to understand emerin's role in human atrial cells.
Emerin is a protein of the inner nuclear membrane (INM), and a component of a nuclear cytoskeletal structure
known as the nuclear lamina. Investigators have thus assumed that EDMD1 arises from defects in emerin's
nuclear functions. However, Emerin has been observed at two locations in cardiomyocytes (CMs); emerin also
localizes to the cardiomyocyte intercalated disc (ID)—a specialized plasma membrane (PM) domain that
electromechanically couples cardiomyocytes to one another. Both of emerin's observed locations are essential
for CM gene regulation and biomechanics, though we do not understand emerin's role at either structure. Our
understanding has been limited by 1) the lack of tools to manipulate emerin's distribution, and 2) the lack of
models to study these CM-specific mechanisms. This proposal will overcome these roadblocks by manipulating
emerin's localization in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-ACMs).
Until our recent discovery, we did not know how emerin localizes to the PM, which impeded our ability to test its
functions there. However, we have discovered that emerin can traverse the secretory pathway through vesicular
transport to the plasma membrane. We hypothesize that secretory trafficking routes emerin to the ID to perform
a specific function in cardiomyocytes. To test this hypothesis, I will first engineer a model cell system to assay
emerin dynamics. Emd -/- mice do not display EDMD1 phenotypes and are thus a poor model of emerin
pathology. hiPSC-ACMs, however, are tractable, mutable, and applicable to human disease. I have previously
identified motifs within emerin that control its trafficking. Using this knowledge, I will introduce a panel of mutants
with enhanced or blocked trafficking into emerin knockout hiPSCs. Using the cell lines I generate, I will test how
emerin disruption affects ACM gene regulatory networks (Aim 2) and cellular mechanics (Aim 3). By controlling
emerin's secretory trafficking, I will also test how its localization at the PM or INM influences these functions.
This system will illuminate emerin's fundamental roles in human atrial cardiomyocytes for the first time. By
defining these mechanisms, we will better understand EDMD1 cardiac defects and open the door to new
potential therapies."
10880601,"An emerging feature of cardiometabolic disease states, including obesity, diabetes, and heart failure is perturbed
metabolism and subsequent elevations of plasma branched-chain amino acids (BCAA; valine, leucine,
isoleucine) and their cognate α-ketoacids (BCKA; KIV, KIC, KMV). Work from our group and others has revealed
that elevated plasma BCKA arise in these conditions due to impaired activity of the branched chain a-ketoacid
dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex in liver, resulting from higher expression of the inhibitory BCKDH kinase,
BDK, and lower expression of the activating phosphatase, PPM1K. Importantly, whole-body manipulation of
BCKA metabolism achieved via pharmacologic or genetic modulation of BDK and PPM1K yields robust impacts
on cardiac structure, function, and metabolism. Thus, novel therapeutic approaches targeting BCKA-related
pathways hold significant potential for treatment of cardiac dysfunction. However, it remains unclear whether
the in vivo effects of systemic BDK and PPM1K manipulation on cardiac function are due to modulation of
PPM1K and BDK activity within the heart or simply the result of chronic exposure of the heart to increased
plasma BCKA. The work outlined in this proposal will build upon our prior work to directly address this important
knowledge gap by leveraging newly developed animal models to: 1) Determine the impact of liver-specific BDK
modulation on cardiac function; 2) Extend our mechanistic understanding of BCKA-mediated signal transduction
pathways in the heart; and 3) Define the role of PPM1K in the heart. The knowledge gained from the completion
of this project is expected to aid in development of BCKA-related therapeutic targets for the treatment of cardiac
dysfunction in a wide range of cardiometabolic diseases."

Persons with serious illness suffer from poor symptom control, decreased quality of life (QoL) and poor
communication with their healthcare providers, especially in terms of goals of care discussions (GOCD).
Palliative care, when offered alongside disease management, offers improved symptom control, QoL,
communication, caregiver satisfaction and reduced caregiver anxiety. Due to a limited specialty-trained
palliative care workforce, however, patients and their caregivers often cannot access these benefits, especially
in the community. These needs are particularly acute in advanced cancer and HF, the two leading causes of
death in the US which also model the most common illness trajectories. The dynamic nature of these illnesses
presents distinct symptom patterns and changing functional status that require an adaptive, dynamic model of
palliative care delivery. Yet, workforce shortages prevent scaling of existing community-based specialty
palliative care models. To meet patient/caregiver dyads' needs with a limited workforce, new models that
deploy palliative care clinicians based on patient's illness trajectory and changing needs are required. The
innovative TIER-PALLIATIVE CARE (TIER-PC) model provides the right level of care to the right patients at the
right time. TIER-PC increases the number and intensity of specialty trained palliative care disciplines added to
the dyad's care team as their symptoms worsen and function declines. In Tier 1, patients who can care for
themselves and have easily managed symptoms, receive support from a community health worker (CHW)
trained to elicit illness understanding in a culturally competent way. In Tier 2, for patients with poorer function
and mild symptoms, a social worker (SW), trained in serious illness communication, joins the CHW to further
elicit patients' illness understanding and goals, and provide caregiver support. In Tier 3, as function decreases
and symptoms increase, an advance practice nurse (APN) joins the CHW+SW to manage complex symptoms.
In Tier 4, for those patients with the poorest function and worst symptoms, an MD joins to address the most
complex needs (e.g., end-of-life treatment preferences and multifaceted symptom control). The CHW follows
dyads longitudinally across all tiers and re-allocates them to the appropriate tier based on their evolving needs.
We will evaluate TIER-PC's efficacy in a multi-site, single blinded, two arm, randomized controlled trial. Patients
with advanced cancer or HF will receive regular assessments by the TIER-PC team to: address symptom and
psychosocial needs; improve illness/prognostic understanding; prescribe medications; and address goals of
care. We will enroll and randomize 400 patients with HF or cancer and their family caregivers to receive TIER-
PC or an augmented control. We will follow dyads for 12 months to determine if TIER-PC: improves patients'
symptom control and QoL (primary outcomes), patient-reported GOCDs and caregiver satisfaction; reduces
caregiver anxiety and post-traumatic stress; and decreases patients' healthcare utilization and cost. By
matching demand to the scarce workforce, our scalable model can improve care for patients with cancer or HF."

approach, to program, trainee and mentor evaluation, utilizing novel tools, to track milestones as well as
outcome metrics of success."
10880668,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 A main challenge in the regeneration field has been to identify the signaling pathways and suitable
cell types needed to enable productive tissue repair. For the eye, the successful generation and
maintenance of eye-specific stem cells is a key goal. Although the process of vertebrate eye development is
well-studied and characterized, the mechanisms that can induce eye stem cell proliferation following injury
or disease remain difficult to identify. This is partly because natural stem cell proliferation typically occurs
during embryo development whereas studies of retinal regeneration have largely utilized adult (or mature)
models – a very different environment. The highly regenerative clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, is an
established model for both development and organ regeneration. It is also closely related to humans. We
found that Xenopus embryos successfully regrew functional eyes within 5 days. Our studies also showed
that successful eye regrowth required increased and extended retinal stem cell proliferation while delaying
new eye formation. One candidate pathway to regulate eye regrowth is bioelectrical signaling. Bioelectrical
signaling is well-characterized for its role in limb regeneration but its role in eye development and regrowth
is unclear. Our data showed that inhibition of bioelectrical signaling blocked eye regrowth, indicating that its
function is required. We seek to understand and define the roles of bioelectrical signaling during eye
regrowth, as a first step towards establishing a protocol for effectively dissecting the similarities and
distinctions between development and repair. This project will: 1) define the expression patterns and key
function of bioelectrical signaling components during eye regrowth and development; 2) assess the role of
bioelectrical signaling in activating regenerative retinal progenitor cell proliferation and expansion, and 3)
identify potential downstream targets. Together, this proposal will leverage the unique biology of Xenopus to
establish an efficient strategy to rapidly define key mechanisms that regulate regrowth-induced retinal
progenitor cell proliferation in vivo. This protocol will set the foundation for eventually building a blueprint for
productive eye repair strategies."
10880520,"Project Summary. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes and is the leading cause of
blindness in the working population. Currently, >40% of the patient population fails to respond to gold-standard
anti-VEGF direct intraocular injection treatments. New therapies that are superior to or synergistic with current
approaches are of great value to patients. Unlike current treatment options, new approaches should be non-
invasive (into the eye), affordable, and not reliant on specialized facilities. Our research program seeks to
develop small molecule PPARα agonists as first-in-class treatments for DR. The promise of PPARα agonism as
a novel strategy for treating DR has been confirmed in human clinical trials, wherein Fenofibrate (Feno), a
clinically used drug for hyperlipidemia, exhibited robust protective effects against DR and retinal
neovascularization (NV) in type 2 diabetic patients. We have determined that the protective effects of Feno are
unrelated to its lipid-lowering activity, but rather result from its agonism of PPARα. Feno however, suffers from
poor retinal distribution, low affinity/selectivity for PPARα, and chemotype related dose-limiting toxicities, all of
which will limit its use as a DR therapy. Recently, we have identified a novel class of non-fibrate PPARα agonists
that demonstrate improved potency and selectivity over Feno in vitro and exhibit efficacy in a retinal vascular
leakage DR animal model (i.p. administration). All totaled, these data provide proof-of-concept and clearly
demonstrate that 1) PPARα maintains critical roles in the major clinical features of DR and 2) Non-fibrate related
PPARα agonists with improved physicochemical properties and ocular distribution have high promise to become
first-in-class therapeutic options for DR. Specific Aims. (1) Structure-based hit to lead optimization of novel
PPARα agonists; (2) Determine the potency and efficacy of newly designed and synthesized analogs; (3) Define
the downstream molecular mechanism(s) underlying the protective effects of PPARα agonism against oxidative
stress and inflammation in DR. Study Design. We will leverage in silico PPARα models developed in our lab to
guide the design of improved agonists. Synthesized analogs will be assessed in in vitro biochemical and cellular
assays for PPARα potency, level of agonism, and isoform selectivity. Compounds meeting pre-defined metrics
will be advanced to secondary assays to determine anti-angiogenic, anti-oxidative, and neuroprotective effects
in vitro. Top compounds will be assessed for efficacy against retinal leukostasis, endothelial impairment, pericyte
loss, vascular leakage, visual function, and neuroretinal apoptosis in animal models. Top performing compounds
will be utilized for detailed studies to define the downstream molecular mechanisms underlying the protective
effects of PPARα agonism against the major etiological drivers of DR. The research is significant in that it will
provide new therapeutic leads and a novel approach for the treatment of DR, thus addressing a pressing global
need. The research is innovative in that it seeks to provide small molecule, non-invasive options for ocular
conditions typically treated with destructive surgical procedures or intraocular injections of biologics."
10906368,"Project Summary/Abstract
Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis (HyperKPP) is one of a family of inherited skeletal muscle diseases known as
the ion channelopathies. HyperKPP patients have mutations in the skeletal muscle Nav1.4 sodium channel.
Importantly, patients suffer intermittent attacks of muscle paralysis and weakness lasting from minutes to days.
Despite identification of the gene responsible, mechanisms underlying the attacks of weakness remain poorly
understood, and current therapies are only modestly effective and have side effects. A mouse model of
HyperKPP has been generated, which recapitulates the key aspects of the disorder in patients. The mouse
model will be used to identify mechanisms contributing to failure of excitation contraction coupling caused by
pathologic depolarization of the membrane potential. These correlated studies will range from ex vivo whole-
muscle force recordings down to measurement of Ca transients in single fibers. A new technique allows for
simultaneous, intracellular recordings of action potentials and Ca transients of single muscle fibers in an intact
muscle. The overall goal is to address currently poorly understood aspects of HyperKPP and to develop novel
strategies for better therapies. This will be done in three Specific Aims:
1) Determine the mechanisms underlying depolarization-induced failure of excitation contraction
coupling (ECC) in normal muscle: Pilot data suggests failure of ECC is more complex than previously
suspected. The proposed correlated studies will elucidate the events preceding failure of ECC.
2) Determine the extent to which depolarization of the membrane potential contributes to failure of ECC
in HyperPP. The proposed studies will determine whether excessive depolarization of mutant muscle can fully
account for weakness. A series of electrophysiology experiments in HyperKPP vs. wild-type mice will address
this fundamental question.
3) Examine block of depolarizing current with a more selective blocker as an effective therapy for
HyperKPP. If the primary cause of HyperKPP is muscle depolarization, blocking the depolarizing current
should provide effective therapy. However, clinical studies suggest that the current Na channel blockers are
not effective in patients.
Identification of mechanisms contributing to depolarization-induced weakness in HyperKPP has implications for
all diseases in which depolarization of muscle contributes to weakness. If effective therapies are found to treat
weakness in the mouse model of HyperkPP, future work will be directed at translating findings to clinical trials
in patients."

Worldwide, over 257 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), which can lead liver
cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The scarcity of small animal models has hampered curative
therapy development and a mechanistic understanding of viral pathogenesis since HBV has a narrow host
tropism limited to humans and chimpanzees, which is poorly understood. Our lab and others have previously
shown that expression of human sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (hNTCP), the HBV receptor,
facilitates viral uptake into murine cells and the intranuclear conversion of HBV relaxed-circular DNA (rcDNA)
into covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is fully supported in mouse cells and yields infectious virions. These
data suggest that a late post-entry step, presumably capsid disassembly and/or nuclear import, constitutes a key
barrier in the murine HBV life-cycle. Prior work showed that heterokaryons formed from mouse and human
hepatoma cells expressing hNTCP are susceptible to HBV infection, suggesting that human-specific factors
critical for the HBV life cycle are missing in mouse hepatocytes rather than (dominant) restriction factor being
present in mouse cells. This prompted us to investigate the role of nuclear import proteins in restricting the murine
HBV life-cycle. My proposal is founded on strong preliminary data from our lab demonstrating that the expression
of several human karyopherin alphas and betas renders mouse Hepa1.6-hNTCP cells susceptible to HBV
infection. Excitingly, our data further show that human, but not mouse, KPNA2 expression increases the
susceptibility to HBV, establishing firmly that the observed increases are not simply due to the higher abundance
of KPNA2 but to the expression of the human orthologues. I now hypothesize that incompatibilities between one
or more karyopherins and the virus preclude efficient import of the HBV genome into mouse nuclei and thereby
block the viral life-cycle in mice. To test this hypothesis, I will first extend our analysis to all karyopherins involved
in nuclear import; I will systematically compare the ability of the respective mouse and human orthologues to
facilitate infection in mouse cells and map subsequently the species-tropism defining regions in KPNA2 and
putatively other karyopherins. Results from this aim will highlight the human-specific dependency factors needed
to break the species barrier for HBV infection in murine cells. Secondly, I aim to determine how human
karyopherins enhance HBV infection in murine cells mechanistically. I hypothesize that human but not mouse
KPNA2, and other karyopherins, can facilitate the import of rcDNA HBV capsids into the nucleus through direct
physical interactions. To test this systematically, I will visualize the subcellular localization of HBV capsids in the
presence of human versus mouse KPNA2 by confocal microscopy. I will further test the relative ability of human
and mouse KPNA2 to bind to HBV capsids, HBV core protein, and rcDNA and determine whether KPNA2
destabilize the HBV nucleocapsid. Results from my work will provide insights into HBV host range restrictions
and life cycle mechanisms and aid in creating an improved mouse model with inheritable HBV susceptibility"
10902488,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Breast cancer is estimated to be the most diagnosed cancer in American women and account for 15% of female
cancer-related deaths in 2023. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype lacking effective
and durable treatment strategies due to the absence of targetable cell surface receptors, including ER, PR, and
HER2. Consequently, TNBC patients face the worst prognosis among breast cancer subtypes. Adaptive immune
activity in the tumor microenvironment is a well-known prognostic indicator within TNBC patients and is correlated
with treatment benefit. However, tumors frequently evolve to avoid immune recognition, which negatively impacts
patient prognosis. Clinical data from paired primary and metastatic breast tumors demonstrate that TNBC
metastases commonly downregulate expression of genes involved in major histocompatibility complex Class I
(MHC-I) antigen presentation, a mechanism by which CD8+ cytotoxic T cells can recognize and kill tumor cells
displaying aberrant neoantigens. Therefore, understanding and addressing tumor immune evasion mediated by
loss of MHC-I has the potential to improve TNBC patient outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that breast tumor
MHC-I loss results in a unique immune-evasive phenotype that can be overcome through novel treatment
modalities.
This proposed research will functionally and molecularly characterize MHC-I-low breast tumors and evaluate
customized combination immunotherapy approaches to enhance anti-tumor adaptive immunity. Experiments in
Aim 1 will determine how MHC-I loss affects tumor progression and immune cell infiltration, through both in vivo
immunocompetent mouse models and computational analysis of human clinical breast cancer datasets. In Aim
2, I will assess whether a CD40 agonist or demethylating agent will increase the efficacy of immunotherapy
against MHC-I-low tumors. Altogether, this work will comprehensively inform how MHC-I-mediated immune
evasion affects multiple facets of breast tumor biology and which therapeutic strategies should be explored in
the clinic to improve patient outcomes."

The introduction of clinical exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing has transformed our ability to
diagnose patients with suspected genetic disease. Clinical exome sequencing identifies a potential molecular
DNA lesion in at least 25-30% of patients with a suspected genetic diagnosis. New technologies such as genome
sequencing, mRNA sequencing, and metabolomics profiling are continuing to increase this diagnostic rate. In
addition, the introduction of these technologies has led to the discovery of hundreds of new disease genes and
to phenotypic expansion within known genetic diagnoses. This continued discovery of new disease genes leads
to structure, function and mechanistic discoveries that point to personalized approaches for management and
therapy. Moreover, a precise genetic diagnosis ends the costly diagnostic odyssey, facilitates personalized
preventive medicine for long-term complications of the diagnosis, enables appropriate anticipatory guidance,
and facilitates genetic counseling for families. However, up to 70% of patients with suspected genetic disease
remain undiagnosed likely because their disease-causing variant(s) has yet to be discovered or because the
clinical significance of variants identified in genomic studies remains unclear. Collaborations between clinician
scientists and model organism researchers have played a fundamental role in facilitating this revolution in
genomic medicine. Model organisms, such as the fruity fly and laboratory mouse, are important tools for aiding
in the interpretation of variants identified in sequencing data. In some cases, model organisms have provided
key data supporting the association of a phenotype with a new disease gene. Beyond modeling the genotype
and phenotype, studies in model organisms, such as fly, mouse, and non-human primates, may inform
therapeutic management of patients with genetic disorders. In addition, these model organisms provide key
resources for biomarker discovery, drug screens, and evaluation of genotype-specific therapeutic strategies.
Our previous success in precision modeling of human disease at BCM is due to strong collaborative efforts
between local clinicians, genome scientists, and model organism scientists that is afforded by the integration of
basic, translational, clinical, and diagnostic activities housed within the DMHG at BCM. This integration has
established a flow of clinical and genomic information from prenatal, pediatric and adult genetics patients and
study participants to laboratory geneticists at Baylor Genetics and various gene discovery programs. In so doing,
we have established and modeled the clinical, preclinical, and model organism workflow that we are now
extending to mammalian species. Our Preclinical/Co-Clinical section will leverage this existing infrastructure
and expertise and extend its use to the wider community through the following aims: 1) Coordinate and review
variant nominations, 2) Formulate clinical questions requiring precision modeling, and 3) Translate clinical
significance of precision models."
10898623,"ABSTRACT
Model organisms are invaluable for understanding the role of genes in human disease and will be key to
assessing the impact of millions of specific genetic variants uncovered by high-throughput genome sequencing.
The modeling of specific genetic variants is predicated on model organisms engineered using precisely targeted
genetic manipulations, careful and accurate variant annotation, and precise phenotyping. The modeling will also
require advanced informatics capabilities to integrate variant information across species, support variant
nomination and assessment, track model production and associated experimental data via a LIMS system, and
to disseminate the information and engage the community via a web portal. Variant information from model
organisms may provide insight into the molecular mechanism underlying a phenotype of interest, inform the
specific genetic targeting strategy, and influence choice of model organism. As variant annotation resources
continue to add information and new resources come online, informatics workflows must be able to
accommodate and incorporate them into the model production process. The Bioinformatics Section of the BCM
Center for Precision Medicine Modeling will develop these informatics capabilities by leveraging our extensive
experience in multi-omic data integration and coordination, cross-species phenotype matching via the MARRVEL
system, extension of our KOMP2 LIMS system implementation, and by leveraging key elements of the ClinGen
Resource, an FDA-recognized repository for genomic information that we co-developed. By linking human and
model information within integrated workflows, the infrastructure will facilitate precision modeling in one direction,
and in the other direction will feed model-derived information and knowledge back to the community. By
integrating variant resources and providing mechanisms for variant evaluation and information sharing, the Pre-
Clinical/Co-Clinical and Disease Modeling Unit will more efficiently develop and evaluate model organisms.
Bioinformatics infrastructure will support the variant evaluation process through final variant selection and
presentation to the Steering Committee."

Poor reproducibility of published research employing model organisms and lack of transparency of study designs
have become areas of concern for the scientific community. These issues can profoundly affect the interpretation
of preclinical studies and must be addressed as genome editing technologies permit rapid modeling of patient-
specific, disease-associated genetic variation and translation to the clinic in the forms of patient risk assessment,
management, and treatment. At the heart of reproducibility issues are the model organism themselves. Stability
and identity of the genetic background, genome integrity, and specifics of genetically engineered alleles often
vary between studies due to use of similar but independently developed models or differences in the quality of
model maintenance. Centralization and standardization of high-quality production and maintenance of animal
models can begin to address issues with study reproducibility and transparency and has been highly successful
for our existing animal modeling programs. The Resource and Service Section of the BCM Center for Precision
Medicine Modeling will build on existing expertise and infrastructures of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network
Model Organism Screening Center Drosophila Core at BCM, the BCM Knockout Mouse Production and
Phenotyping site, the BCM-Rice Small Animal Testing Center for the Somatic Cell Genome Editing Program,
and a large rhesus macaque sequence resource in the Human Genome Sequencing Center to (1) acquire,
characterize, and maintain high-quality fly and mouse resources, (2) preserve and distribute fly and mouse
resources, (3) coordinate Center fee-for-service activities for biomedical researchers, (4) communicate the
availability and quality of Center resources and services, and (5) enact procedures to evaluate Section
operations."

The Disease Modeling Unit of the BCM Center for Precision Medicine Modeling will be responsible for producing
and phenotyping the Center’s precision animal models. The Unit will use advanced genome editing and
modification techniques and phenotyping workflows developed by our existing animal modeling programs to (1)
produce mouse and fly models that recapitulate human disease-associated variants and (2) validate variant-
disease associations, identify disease mechanisms, and test putative interventions in fly and mouse models.
Moreover, the Unit will screen sequencing data from rhesus macaque colonies to identify animals with putative
disease-associated variants in genes of interest. The Unit will undertake three Demonstration Projects intended
to showcase the proposed Center’s ability to model undiagnosed and rare diseases affecting a variety of organ
systems at different ages of onset and to translate model organism findings back to patient care. These
nomination projects will integrate mechanistic studies in the fly with phenotyping and intervention studies in the
mouse to demonstrate the fly and mouse model production capacity, breadth of phenotyping capabilities, and
potential translational impact of models generated by the Center. Together with the Bioinformatics and
Preclinical/Co-Clinical Sections, the Unit will also participate in the human disease-associated variant nomination
process by identifying the correct precision animal model (e.g. fly, mouse) and by identifying phenotyping
strategies that answer clinically relevant questions posed by local and external nominators. The Unit will also
assess whether a putative rhesus macaque model is available for each nominated variant. When nominated
variants are selected for modeling, the Unit will work closely with the Resource and Service Section during project
planning to ensure that the correct models are selected, and a rigorous study plan is enacted. Overall, the goal
of studies performed using the Unit’s precision models will be to uncover new disease mechanisms, reveal new
disease biomarkers and phenotypes, and identify potential new therapeutic strategies for patients."

transition to independent research careers. Our program serves multiple institutions in San Antonio, the 7th
largest city in the U.S. and one of the largest Hispanic majority minority cities – reflecting the future demographics
of the U.S. The OAIC is the focal point for geroscience research training for the South Texas region.
 Our overall goal is to foster development of early-stage investigators in translational geroscience. Scholars
will have a comprehensive skill set to test aging-modulating interventions in older adults. Our REC program was
successfully established within the last 4 years to 1) enhance clinical and translational research knowledge and
experience of basic scientists; 2) develop mechanistic research skills of clinical investigators; and 3) facilitate
collaborations among basic and clinical researchers. This goal is achieved through the following Aims:
Aim 1: Oversee the recruitment, selection, monitoring, and evaluation of a highly qualified, dedicated and diverse
group of early-career REC Scholars; assisting with their development into clinical and translational scientists in
geroscience who can effectively lead and contribute to interdisciplinary research teams.
Aim 2: Provide active multi-disciplinary supervising (mentoring) teams that regularly monitor, evaluate, and guide
the progress of each REC Scholar through their research and career development programs; Scholars and their
mentors will develop individualized structured research education plans with clearly defined responsibilities and
milestones based on their investigative needs and focused on cross-training in translational sciences.
Aim 3: Recruit and advance the careers of a diverse cadre of Scholars across multiple dimensions, including
women, underrepresented minorities and active-duty military and veterans representative of our patient
population to build a geroscience workforce with expertise in medicine, nursing, psychology, pharmacy and other
health care disciplines necessary for advancing geriatric care in a team science environment.
Aim 4: Promote cross-fertilization and assure integration of the REC participants' career development and
activities with a) all San Antonio OAIC programs and b) the national OAIC network.
 Our Core has two customized tracks: the OAIC Phase 1 Program provides salary support, intensive
mentoring and didactics in translational geroscience to a diverse cadre of early-stage investigators. Phase 2
provides continued career development activities for Scholars finishing Phase 1 and early-stage faculty
emphasizing growth in independence leadership and mentoring skills. The REC trains the next generation of
scientists in geroscience by weaving together the robust and unique aging research resources and research
education programs in South Texas into an integrated enhanced career development environment. We are well
positioned to translate healthy aging strategies developed in rodents and tested in marmosets to promote
healthspan and accelerate progress in the new discipline of translational geroscience."

10898684,"In recent years, major advances have been made in our understanding of the basic biology of aging, leading
to the identification of novel interventions with potential to prolong healthspan. In spite of exciting studies in
model organisms, there has been a lack of programs and infrastructure needed to enable the translation of these
discoveries to humans. The major objective of the Pilot / Exploratory Studies Core (PESC) is to promote the
overarching goals of the San Antonio Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) by developing and
validating interventions to enhance healthy aging and mitigate the progression of aging-associated processes
and diseases. Indeed, the PESC plays a key role in the San Antonio OAIC's central theme of translational
geroscience by supporting projects that move research on the basic biology of aging from the laboratory bench
to the bedside, in order to extend healthy life expectancy. The PESC will provide merit-based support for
rigorously designed pilot studies that test both the efficacy and side effect profiles of promising pharmacologic,
as well as non-pharmacologic cell-based and behavioral interventions, in pre-clinical marmoset models and early
human clinical studies. The PESC will strive to achieve its objectives through the following specific aims:
 • Aim 1: To promote innovative, collaborative, multidisciplinary research to test interventions designed to
 extend healthy life expectancy, both in early human trials and in non-human primate marmoset models.
 • Aim 2: To work closely with the Resource Cores and Research Education Component to provide
 infrastructure, scientific support, and funding for innovative pilot proposals from mentored junior faculty
 investigators, as well as established researchers.
 • Aim 3: To encourage pilot studies that will develop and apply novel methods and technologies.
 • Aim 4: To sustain effective processes to solicit, review, and fund pilot projects, as well as ensure study
 completion, robust tracking of downstream impact, and optimal dissemination and implementation.
 The Core leaders, having a great deal of experience directing successful pilot project programs, will promote
key alignments and interactions of PESC investigators with OAIC Resource Cores, as well as with resources in
the broader scientific community. The Core will provide close oversight and guidance to PESC-supported studies
from inception, during the investigative and analytical phases, through publication, and ultimately through the
submission of proposals for competitive national grant funding. The PESC will seek proposals on rapidly evolving
age-related scientific areas such as resilience – the capacity to return to normal functional homeostasis after
stress exposure. To address the shrinking pipeline of qualified translational investigators the PESC is committed
to funding meritorious proposals from early-stage investigators. Finally, we have received significant leveraging
commitments, enabling PESC project investments of $290K annually and positioning the PESC to achieve both
a robust return on investment and significant impact on translational geroscience."
10898688,"Several interventions have been shown to promote healthy life extension in rodents. However, analogous
prospective, interventional lifespan studies in healthy people are extremely challenging. The Pre-clinical
Research Core (RC1) of the SA OAIC addresses this barrier by providing the knowledge, skills, and technical
support to assist OAIC investigators in using the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as a pre-clinical model
for translational geroscience research. RC1 focuses on marmosets as a pre-clinical model for several reasons:
 a) They are relatively short-lived nonhuman primates; b) marmosets are small (300-500 g), requiring less
costs for husbandry and compound administration; c) marmosets can be maintained in their usual social
configurations; d) their spectrum of naturally-occurring age-related pathologies is comparable to that of humans;
and e) they allow assessment of interventions in tissues that cannot be readily collected in people (e.g. brain,
heart, kidney, liver). Reflecting the interest in this model, the NIA recently released an RFA entitled
“Characterization of Marmosets as Models of Aging and Age-Related Diseases”.
 RC1 achieves its mission through the following Specific Aims: 1) Provide OAIC investigators access to a
unique colony of aging marmosets; 2) Provide resources required for studying effects of aging interventions on
marmoset healthspan; 3) Provide and maintain a bank of tissues from marmosets across the age range; 4)
Provide services to assess analytical pharmacology in marmosets; and 5) Support the research training and
dissemination missions of the OAIC.
 During the initial award cycle, RC1 successfully assisted 13 OAIC funded projects and an additional 13
external projects. RC1 provided tissues to 16 more scientists. Other key accomplishment of RC1 include:
• Perform the initial characterization of several aging phenotypes of marmosets, including functional changes
with age in executive function, kidney pathology, cardiovascular health, immune function, and the microbiome;
• Conduct the first study testing whether nonhuman primate lifespan is extended by a pharmaceutical
intervention (rapamycin);
• Carry out early-phase pharmacology and tolerability studies with metformin, acarbose and 17α-estradiol that
will lay the foundation for long-term lifespan and healthspan trials;
• Assist OAIC Scholars and pilot grant recipients to successfully obtain funding from several external sources
(NIA, NIDCR, and AFAR) to expand and extend their studies with marmosets; and
• Enhance the visibility of the marmoset model and promote use of this valuable resource across the country.
 During the next award cycle, RC1 will support 2 pilot, 1 Scholar and 10 external projects. RC1 also will support
two developmental projects (DPs) with highly innovative features: DP1 entitled “Human-marmoset comparative
assessment of the role of mTOR in cardiac aging”, and DP2 entitled “Comparative lipidomics of aging”."
10898691,"The overarching goal of RC2 is to offer comprehensive, centralized, clinical trial support for study design,
regulatory compliance, recruitment, retention, assessment, procedures, pharmacology, and data management.
 During the initial award cycle, RC2 quadrupled (to 20) its number of trials, the majority of which were phase
1 trials to evaluate safety and tolerability of compounds in healthy older adults and phase 2, proof-of-concept
studies to obtain preliminary data on efficacy and functional parameters (e.g. healthspan) in patients with age-
related disease. Major accomplishments made by OAIC members with RC2 support include: the first study of
rapamycin in healthy older adults; the first senolytics trial in humans; and launching of an NIH-funded long-term
trial of metformin for frailty prevention. RC2 played a key role in the career development of OAIC Scholars who
received highly prestigious grants, including a K76 Beeson Award and a VA Career Development Award-2.
 RC2 has built a robust program to insure that good clinical practice (GCP) is followed in clinical studies. Our
programs include: subject recruitment and retention, a subject registry and repository, a data safety monitoring
board (DSMB), a Geriatrics Practice Based Research Network (PBRN), and a community advisory board. RC2
provides critical clinical pharmacology services to support biospecimen (plasma, CSF, urine, muscle, adipose)
collection, or to measure levels of drugs (e.g. metformin, senolytics) or ensure safe administration of local
anesthetics to participants receiving biopsies. RC2 contributed to the overall OAIC program mission by closely
collaborating with other geroscience programs, including multi-center, phase 2 studies on senolytics and stem
cell activators (e.g. oxytocin), and multi-center trials such as the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity
Consortium (MoTrPAC), ASPREE-XT, and DPPOS. RC2 achieves its mission through the following Aims:
 1) Provide expertise and advice for investigators to plan and design innovative clinical studies to rigorously
test interventions to improve healthspan; 2) Enhance the SA OAIC support infrastructure to ensure successful
subject recruitment and safe and ethical conduct of all OAIC-supported clinical studies; 3) Catalyze translational
human studies and trials through provision of comprehensive core services; 4) Provide analytical and clinical
pharmacology expertise supporting drug pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic analyses as well as toxicity
and safety assessment; 5) Disseminate to the lay public and scientific community the latest research on
geroscience-related health promotion and the importance/relevance of translational geroscience research; and
6) Support training in translational geroscience for early-stage faculty and those new to clinical research.
 In the first year of the next award cycle, RC2 plans to support 3 pilot, 3 Scholar, and 10 external projects.

Progress in improving infection outcomes depends upon understanding factors that diminish antibiotic action.
Recent work suggests antibiotic heteroresistance may be a key factor. Heteroresistant pathogens exhibit
population-level resistance heterogeneity, meaning they contain highly resistant subpopulations, and often
exhibit unstable resistance, meaning some cells become rapidly sensitive when grown without antibiotics.
This proposal focuses on these two phenotypes as they are postulated to have major effects on susceptibility
testing and antibiotic efficacy. Here we propose to study population-level resistance heterogeneity and
unstable resistance in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa)
infections who cycle on and off inhaled tobramycin.
CF offers key advantages for these studies as it is a monogenic disease with uniform manifestations, the
responses of a single bacterial species to the same antibiotic can be studied in sizable cohorts, and
infrastructure exists to procure primary specimens from the infected site (sputum) during antibiotic ""on"" and
""off"" periods. These advantages, and methods developed in our preliminary work enable us to test the
hypotheses that Pa from chronically-infected patients exhibit marked population-level resistance heterogeneity
and unstable resistance; that parameters accounting for these factors predict clinical responses to treatment;
and that unstable resistance in CF Pa is due to a core set of gene amplifications and fitness-compensating
point mutations. This work will generate foundational knowledge about antibiotic heteroresistance that could
improve understanding of antibiotic treatment failure in CF, and suggest new precision medicine approaches to
select antibiotics and improve outcomes. The findings could also guide future work in infections where patient
heterogeneity, pathogen and treatment diversity, and less developed infrastructure make studies more difficult."

Social determinants of health (SDOH)—the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age—
are key drivers of health disparities. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Academy of Medicine,
and payers such as the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services recommend integrating screening for
adverse SDOH and generating referrals to social services within the healthcare delivery system as a central
way to promote patient and population health. While many pediatric outpatient practices are now implementing
SDOH screening, little attention has been paid to the inpatient setting, representing a missed opportunity to
advance health equity. Overall, ten percent of U.S. infants are born preterm and they are disproportionately
born to low-income and minority mothers. Up to a quarter of families with preterm infants have unmet basic
needs, such as housing or job insecurity, which represent adverse SDOH. Preterm infants are especially
vulnerable to early-life programming by the social conditions that they grow up in, with sustained impacts on
function across multiple organ systems. Unfortunately, efforts to implement effective interventions that address
unmet basic needs in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) where preterm infants are hospitalized after birth
for weeks to months are lacking. The goal of this proposal is to translate an established model of SDOH
screening and referral from the outpatient pediatric setting to the NICU, thereby maximizing the potential to
offset effects of adverse SDOH on vulnerable mother-preterm infant dyads. Our study team has previously
developed and tested the low-touch SDOH screening and referral intervention called “WE CARE” in the
outpatient pediatric setting and demonstrated its effectiveness on increasing receipt of community resources.
We now propose a hybrid effectiveness-implementation cluster RCT in 8 U.S. safety-net NICUs (4 WE CARE
NICUs and 4 control NICUs), using the Proctor Conceptual Model of Implementation Research. We will
implement WE CARE into 4 NICUs and longitudinally follow a cohort of 576 mother-preterm infant dyads (288
per study arm) for 12 months after NICU discharge. In Aim 1, we will examine the implementation of WE CARE
into the NICU, assessing its appropriateness, feasibility, penetration, equity, and sustainability. In Aim 2, we
will examine the effectiveness and equity of WE CARE in the NICU setting on parental receipt of community
resources for unmet basic needs 3-months post-NICU discharge. Finally, in Aim 3, we will explore the effect of
WE CARE on maternal mental health and preterm infant health and development. The proposed low-intensity,
scalable WE CARE intervention has tremendous potential to shift the paradigm of systematic social needs
screening and referral from the outpatient to inpatient healthcare delivery system and address adverse SDOH
at the earliest stages of life in a highly vulnerable pediatric population, with the potential to improve children’s
health and developmental trajectories along with maternal mental health and well-being."

different mechanisms that control the parallel development of these populations in very different contexts.
While we previously reported that the transcription factor (TF) PLZF was a common signature of innate

enhancers that differentially control the helper lineage-specific TFs Gata-3, T-bet and RORgt in innate and
in adaptive lymphocytes, with emphasis on NK cells. We develop an epigenetic approach that identifies
these enhancers and we generate enhancer reporter strains that are used to specifically manipulate innate
and adaptive populations. The advantage of this approach is that epigenetic markers appear earlier and
are more stable than the TF that they regulate. They also provide more complexity and specificity to dissect
these developmental programs. In support of this approach, we recently identified a dedicated, ILC2-

10899456,"Synucleinopathy Dementias (Syn-­Dementias) are age related, progressive neurodegenerative diseases 
that are characterized by α-­Synuclein (αSyn) rich neuronal inclusions called Lewy Bodies (LBs). Syn-­Dementias 
include Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), Parkinson’s Disease with Dementia (PDD), as well as a subset of 
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) cases with LB pathology which constitute ~40% of AD cases. Sustained 
neuroinflammation (mediated primarily by microglia) and progressive αSyn aggregation are hallmarks of Syn-­
Dementias. We recently described the activation of the Nod Like Receptor Protein-­3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in 
mouse synucleinopathy models and in human PD brains. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multi-­protein arm of 
the innate immune system which, when activated, results in the production of the cytokine interleukin-­1 beta (IL-­
1β), as well as oligomerized Apoptosis-­associated Speck-­like protein containing a Caspase Recruitment Domain 
(ASC), which is the adaptor protein of the NLRP3 inflammasome. It is currently unknown what pathological role 
inflammasome activation may play in the progression of Syn-­Dementias. Our preliminary data suggests that 
microglia-­released ASC may be taken up by neurons and may cross-­seed αSyn fibrilization. The overarching 
goal of this proposal is to elucidate the pathological role of microglia to neuron transmission of 
oligomerized ASC in contributing to progressive αSyn aggregation in Syn-­Dementias. We also seek to 
elucidate the signaling mechanisms in microglia that lead to the oligomerization and release of ASC, and 
the mechanisms in neurons that lead to its uptake. In Aim 1, I will perform a series of experiments including 
Protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) and neuron/microglia co-­culture studies in microfluidic chambers 
to support our preliminary findings. These experiments will be performed in the laboratories of primary mentors 
Ted and Valina Dawson and project consultant Xiaobo Mao. I will also validate neuronal ASC pathology as a 
pathological hallmark of Syn-­Dementias. This will be done in the lab of co-­mentor Juan Troncoso. Aim 2 will 
involve assessing the effects of blocking microglia to neuron ASC transmission on neuronal αSyn pathology. In 
the mentored phase, I will first inhibit Caspase-­1 (Casp-­1), an enzyme required for ASC release from cells but 
not its oligomerization or recruitment to inflammasome complexes. Conditioned medium from inflammasome-­
activated WT and Casp1-­/-­ microglia will be used to elicit αSyn aggregation in mouse cortical neurons. We will 
also seek to identify a neuronal uptake mechanism for microglia-­released ASC. This will be done by utilizing 
unbiased receptor screening to identify and characterize novel neuronal receptors for oligomerized ASC. These 
set of experiments will be performed in collaborator Xiaobo Mao’s laboratory. In the independent phase of Aim-­
2, I will investigate the ramifications of preventing ASC transmission by blocking its microglial release. In Aim 3, 
I will investigate the novel mechanism by which the E-­3 ligase Parkin inhibits ASC oligomerization in microglia 
by ubiquitinating the inflammasome receptor NLRP3 and targeting it for proteasomal degradation. In the 
independent phase, I will explore how adult onset knockout of Parkin in microglia will hasten the propagation 
of αSyn in mouse models. In this regard, I have already generated the Parkinflx/flx/Casp1WT and Parkinflx/flx/Casp1-­
/-­ mice that I will need for these studies. My training in the biology of dementia and aging biology will be facilitated 
by didactic courses as well as by participation in Clinical Pathological Seminars, Dementia and Aging Symposia 
at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and will be overseen by co-­mentor Marilyn Albert. All aspects 
of this project are novel and have not been investigated before. This project may elucidate a novel signaling 
conduit through which inflammasome activation directly leads to αSyn aggregation in neurons. The training that 
I undertake at Johns Hopkins will enable me to transition to independence and lead a laboratory that investigates 
the molecular mechanisms of pathology in neurodegenerative diseases."
10899526,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a critical gap in knowledge pertaining to pain before and after surgery for individuals with cerebral
palsy (CP), including the development of chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP; long-lasting pain that develops or
worsens after surgery). CPSP is an especially troubling outcome; it is difficult to treat and can impact all
aspects of life, extend opioid use, diminish surgical outcomes, and can last a lifetime. In children without
disability, CPSP is estimated to occur in 13-69% of those undergoing orthopedic procedures, including spinal
fusion. CPSP is likely at least this frequent in children with CP. Children with CP may undergo 8-22 orthopedic
procedures in their lifetime, yet perioperative pain is rarely documented in the literature. The long-term goal of
our proposed project is to develop safe and effective strategies to reduce the incidence and severity of CPSP
in children with CP. The current objective is to document the typical trajectory of perioperative pain experience
in CP and to identify important predictive factors for the development of CPSP. Our central hypothesis, based
on prior research on individuals without disability, is that children with CP have reliably identifiable trajectories
of perioperative pain, as well as risk factors that predict the development of CPSP. Knowledge of risk factors
for CPSP in children with CP will support future delivery of treatment to those at risk for CPSP and will
ultimately bolster the development and provision of superior interventions. The study hypotheses will be tested
by completing the following specific aims: 1) document the typical course of pain and opioid use before and for
one year after orthopedic surgery in children with CP; 2) identify characteristics (e.g., CP severity,
catastrophizing) that predict CPSP and persistent opioid use; and 3) examine the relationship between
perioperative pain severity and functional/mobility outcomes. To accomplish the aims, pain and opioid use will
be assessed via parent and child (when able) report (e.g., pain location, intensity, interference, quality) prior to
and for 12 months after surgery. Psychosocial factors (e.g., anxiety) will be assessed before surgery and
functional measures (e.g., gait kinematics) will be assessed before and one year after surgery. In alignment
with the Biobehavioral Pain Network model, a modified (i.e., non-language dependent) quantitative sensory
test will be conducted before and twice after surgery to quantify pain sensitivity. Work to date concludes that
pain is prevalent, long-lasting, and debilitating in individuals with CP. The proposed research is innovative
because (a) perioperative pain trajectories and factors predictive of CPSP and opioid use will be documented
for the first time, and (b) a risk index will be developed to provide individual patients’ percent risk for CPSP. We
expect the knowledge translation potential here to be high. This contribution will be significant because it will
position the field with the ability to identify those with CP at greatest risk for CPSP, providing justification to
deploy current clinical perioperative pain management strategies, manage identified psychosocial factors, and
facilitate informed decision making with respect to surgical and non-surgical treatments."
10897507,"Project Summary/ Abstract: Our existing award titled: Partnership for Research in Emerging Viral
Infections-Sierra Leone, (PREVSL) [pronounced “Prev Sil”] (currently in its fifth year) has successfully begun
to lay the foundation for Sierra Leone led implementation science and clinical trial research in emerging infections
through capacity strengthening activities that targeted both the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH), a long-
standing international field research site for the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever research program, located in the
country´s Eastern Province; and the College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences (COMAHS) at University of
Sierra Leone (USL) in the capital city of Freetown, the country’s only medical school.
Emerging infections threaten the health of people, animals, and agriculture but our systems for surveillance and
detection are limited. Emerging infections are defined as those that have recently appeared in a population or
that previously existed but have recently increased in incidence or geographic scope, such as was seen with the
recent Mpox outbreak.
Africa, and in particular West Africa, has a disproportionate vulnerability to outbreaks due to the large number of
zoonotic reservoirs, poor healthcare infrastructure, and the high number of endemic infectious diseases found
there. In Sierra Leone alone, EVD, Lassa Fever, Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, Yellow Fever, Dengue,
Chikungunya, Mpox, Influenza, and SARS-CoV-2 have all been identified there. In addition, bat populations
common to Sierra Leone have been found to have Marburg virus. Finally, like much of Africa, Sierra Leone also
has high rates of antimicrobial resistance.
With the foundations established in Phase I of PREVSL now in place, we will shift the bulk of our focus in the
renewal proposal towards COMAHS, ensuring it has the capacity to train the next generation of high quality
biomedical and public health scientists AND that it maximizes its potential to be a major player in driving Sierra
Leone´s infectious disease research agenda. We will do this while continuing to strengthen the KGH clinical
research program as a training site for future COMAHS masters and doctoral student researchers and through
the promotion of ongoing implementation science and clinical trial research in emerging infections from which
trainees can attain practical and applied research skills and experiences.
Our Specific Aims are to 1) Train four PhD level investigators from Sierra Leone in disciplines relevant to
emerging infectious diseases and pandemic preparedness; 2) Reinforce institutional capacity and
competitiveness of COMAHS as Sierra Leone´s premier academic health sciences research institution; and 3)
Promote and expand the conduct of high-quality implementation science and clinical trial research in emerging
infectious diseases and pandemic preparedness by continuing to capacitate the Kenema Government Hospital
- clinical research program field site."

People living with HIV (PLWH) are at increased risk of developing HIV-related lymphoma, are less likely to
receive cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and the likelihood of receiving a curative
treatment such as hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) for HIV-related lymphoma is unknown. There are no
definitive guidelines for HCT use in HIV-related lymphoma, despite studies demonstrating equivalent overall
survival between those with and without HIV. Current evidence is limited by small samples or single-center
studies conducted with highly specialized infectious disease teams. Clinical challenges unique to HIV include
added risks for infections and hospitalizations, and drug-drug interactions between antiretrovirals and
chemotherapy, contributing to the lack of HCT adoption in HIV-related lymphoma. Inequities in HCT utilization
in HIV-related lymphoma are influenced by social determinants of health. Patients who are Black/African
American, do not have private insurance, and have low socioeconomic status are less likely to receive HCT in
general, but these barriers to HCT in HIV-related lymphoma have never been studied. This proposal will
characterize the social determinants of health that influence HCT utilization in patients with HIV-related
lymphoma, and elucidate if supportive measures are needed to address differences in care outcomes based
on HIV status. Our central hypothesis is that in HIV-related lymphoma patients, certain social determinants of
health are associated with less HCT utilization, and that PLWH have distinct treatment burden and hospital
use. We will test our hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: 1) Measure the associations between
sociodemographic and clinical factors on HCT utilization in patients with HIV-related lymphoma, and 2) Test for
differences in treatment burden, hospital use, and survival outcomes between lymphoma HCT recipients with
and without HIV. Our research team at UC Davis linked an innovative dataset using the Center for International
Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), California Cancer Registry, and California Patient
Discharge Data that will be used in cohort and matched case-control designs in this F31 proposal. By
completing the training objectives in this F31, the applicant will gain the skills necessary to become an
independent nurse scientist and Principal Investigator, while characterizing inequities in HCT utilization and
disparities in care outcomes influenced by social determinants of health. Specifically, through a mentoring
team spanning UC Davis, UC San Francisco, and Stanford University the F31 applicant will 1) Acquire skills in
epidemiologic approaches (population health), secondary analysis, and advanced biostatistics, 2) Gain HIV
clinical management expertise, 3) Advance knowledge in health equity, health disparities, and social
determinants of health, and 4) Leadership and professional development to become a principal investigator."

 The rise in obesity and metabolic diseases worldwide has dire consequences on public health.
Concomitant with this rise are changes in diet. Notably, consumption of highly palatable foods that are high in
saturated fat and refined carbohydrates – collectively referred to as the Western diet (WD) – has increased
globally 1,2. Because children are in key stages of development and reportedly obtain ~65% of their total energy
intake from such high-fat, high-sugar foods 3, they are especially vulnerable to the impacts of the WD 4,5.
Furthermore, emerging evidence reveals that WD consumption impairs neurocognitive processes, particularly
when consumed during early life developmental periods 6,7. These negative outcomes can occur independent of
obesity and metabolic dysfunction, and early life WD consumption preferentially disrupts memory processes
that rely on the hippocampus 8,9, a brain region classically associated with learning and memory function and
more recently with food intake control 10. However, the critical timing and duration of such dietary exposure
during childhood and adolescence are poorly understood. Further, the neurobiological mechanisms that give
rise to early life WD-associated hippocampal dysfunction remain elusive. One hypothesis is that the
microbiome may be functionally involved, as microbial taxa were previously shown to be causally related to
memory impairments associated with early life consumption of added sugars 11. An additional hypothesis is that
WD-induced hippocampal dysfunction may be caused, in part, by impairments in the acetylcholine system,
given that obesity-promoting foods have previously been shown to alter these systems 7,12,13 and that
acetylcholine has been implicated in novelty and contextual-based memory processes that are particularly
vulnerable to WD-associated impairments 14. Accordingly, this proposal builds off our preliminary results to
unravel the mechanisms by which early life WD consumption impairs hippocampal function. Results from Aim
1 will determine whether memory impairments associated with early life WD consumption can be pinpointed
to specific developmental epochs within the larger juvenile-adolescent period (early, mid, late, or the entire
juvenile-adolescent period). Aim 2 experiments will utilize bacterial genome sequencing analyses and
microbiome transplant approaches to determine whether the microbiome is functionally related to
hippocampal deficits from early life WD consumption. Finally, based off preliminary data, Aim 3 experiments
will utilize two complementary in vivo approaches (behavioral neuropharmacology and in vivo fiber
photometry) to reveal whether altered acetylcholine signaling is functionally implicated in early life WD-
induced hippocampal dysfunction. Collectively, the proposed experiments will make strides in identifying the
critical developmental periods and mechanisms by which early life WD consumption imparts long-lasting
hippocampal dysfunction."

Multiple Myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic malignancy and is almost always preceded by
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering myeloma (SMM). Recent
randomized trials have shown that early therapeutic intervention at the stage of SMM can improve progression-
free and overall survival. This indicates that early detection and therapeutic intervention before symptomatic MM
occurs may lead to improved survival and decreased morbidity from other complications such as bone fractures,
renal failure and hospitalizations related to end-organ damage from myeloma. Early detection requires a
comprehensive screening of the population at risk for developing MM. Known risk factors for developing MM
include aging, race (Blacks), and familial history of hematologic malignancies. Our preliminary data of screening
~7,500 ethnically diverse individuals at risk of developing MM using a sensitive quantitative MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometry has shown a prevalence rate of monoclonal protein in 45% in individuals of age >50y and having
an early immune dysregulation that we termed Monoclonal Gammopathy of Indeterminate Potential (MGIP).
MGUS was significantly more prevalent in Black participants and participants with familial hematologic
malignancy (HM) history than in White participants with no family history of HM. To begin to delineate
mechanisms by which these early MGIP clones progress to MGUS and further lead to MM, we plan to explore
the host intrinsic (age, race, germline risk factors) and acquired (inflammation, antigenic activation) risk factors
on the expanding clone and its environment that influence its behavior. We believe the next frontier in MM
research is to understand how one develops myeloma and treat it early before end-organ damage.
Identifying and preventing the development of the earliest stages of MM will lead to transformative approaches
to treatment and serve as a paragon of cancer prevention. We hypothesize that defining risk as ancestry
scores and genomic signatures, instead of defining risk by self-identified race, can improve risk
prediction for MM. Similarly, instead of using chronological age as a risk factor for MM, we will test the
hypothesis that the effective age of the bone marrow niche confers biological risk of developing MM.
Together, we believe that these studies will help define the mechanistic underpinnings of the carcinogenic
process linked to MM. This approach will allow the field to transition from a purely demographic definition of risk
to a biological one."
10879657,"Abstract. Keratoconus (KC) is the most common and one of the most serious forms of corneal ectasia.
Corneal thinning and deformation of corneal geometry leads to its near-conical shape. Corneal shape and
thickness are currently used to characterize ecstatic changes, and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is
the most accurate tool for that. Although corneal shape can be used to calculate refractive power, it cannot be
used alone to predict disease progression. In fact, elastic moduli changes in the cornea are a driver of ectasia.
Corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) is a minimally invasive procedure that can potentially slow the progression
of ectasia [1-4]. UV light modifies the microstructure of cornea soaked in riboflavin and forms additional
chemical bonds between collagen fibers in the stroma leading to increased corneal stiffness. However, there
is currently no instrument that can provide noncontact, accurate assessment of corneal
anisotropic elastic
moduli. Indeed, the cornea is a bounded medium of highly organized collagen fibrils resulting in its highly
anisotropic mechanical behavior, requiring detailed techniques and models to map its elastic moduli.
The goal of this project is to develop a non-contact, non-invasive clinical tool based on Optical Coherence
Tomography and Elastography (OCE) to simultaneously map geometry (curvature and thickness) and image
elastic in- and out-of-plane mechanical moduli of cornea for longitudinal pre-and post-operative diagnostics of
KC progression and evaluate CXL surgery outcomes.
We hypothesize that quantifying corneal elasticity in vivo will enable significant innovation, providing a basis to
build an individualized biomechanical model of the eye, monitor progression of KC and other ectatic changes
in the cornea, guide customized treatment plans, and both predict and evaluate refractive surgery outcomes.
SA1 will focus on optimizing our unique AµT-OCE system for in vivo elasticity measurements in KC patients,
building it on a slit-lamp based platform and combining it with OCT topography. In SA2, we will map baseline
elastic properties in rabbit cornea pre- and post-CXL to confirm that elastic property changes due to the
procedure can be quantified. Leveraging the results of SA1, SA3 will focus on baseline moduli in healthy
volunteers matching the most likely demographic of KC patients to determine whether
moduli depend on race
and IOP
and define diagnostic criteria for KC. Finally, in SA4 we will perform cornea moduli mapping in KC
patients longitudinally pre- and post-CXL to comprehensively compare them to those in normal subjects.
This project builds on the rigor of our previous research where (i) we invented a fully non-contact system
to launch mechanical waves in the cornea and track their propagation with fast OCT [5, 6]. (ii) We showed that
the cornea is highly anisotropic and developed a proper model of corneal biomechanics [7, 8]. (iii) We tested
our approach in ex vivo and in vivo studies and validated our results with mechanical tests [7-10]. We also
obtained statistically significant preliminary data for CXL treated human cornea ex vivo [9]."
10879901,"Human milk (HM) is dynamic - its composition changes during the day, and over time along with infant needs.
This chronobiology of HM has long been acknowledged to play a role in infant development and programming
but is poorly characterized. While clinical outcomes differ between infants fed at-the-breast (ATB) vs expressed
(ie: pumped) HM, how infant input (via suckling) influences HM biology also remains unknown, even though
“pumping” is an almost universal practice. As such, our over-arching hypotheses are that HM composition and
dynamics, when studied as a biological system, differ between infants fed ATB vs expressed HM, and interrupting
delivery of natural HM chronobiological signals to the infant (via feeding expressed HM) impacts infant sleep
patterns and microbiome development. Our interdisciplinary team will collect daily HM samples, and extensive
metadata from exclusively breastfeeding mothers and infants between 1-4 months postpartum: 60 dyads
exclusively feeding ATB (ATB group) and 60 dyads exclusively expressing HM (Express group). Multi-omics
analytical platforms will be used to characterize HM hormones, macronutrients, microbiota, oligosaccharides,
cytokines, and immunoglobulins to study HM as an ecological system. This novel high-resolution sampling
combined with cutting-edge analytical and modeling techniques power these aims:
1) Detect temporal changes in HM composition diurnally and longitudinally and compare these
 trajectories between ATB vs Express groups. Time-series models and machine-learning analytic
approaches will be utilized to infer latent HM dynamics and temporal trajectories, identifying (for the first
 time) longitudinal and 24-hour temporal patterns in HM composition. We will then determine if and how
 these trajectories differ between ATB vs Express Groups.
 2) Identify relationships between HM composition and dynamics with infant sleep patterns. Compare
 these relationships and sleep outcomes between ATB vs Express groups. Biometric assessment of
 infant sleep will be gathered via actigraphy. Bayesian supervised machine learning algorithms will link HM
 “Lactotypes” and components with sleep outcomes. The resulting algorithm will distinguish if relationships
 between HM composition and dynamics and infant sleep outcomes differs between ATB vs Express groups.
 3) Identify relationships between HM composition and dynamics with the developing infant
 microbiome, and compare these differences between groups. Machine learning models will identify
 “Milk Lactotypes” and specifics of HM dynamics that predict the time-course of infant microbiome
 colonization – a critical marker of future health outcomes. These models will assess how the relationship
 between HM and infant microbiome differs between feeding ATB vs Express feeding groups.
Our study will inform precision nutrition guidance to families feeding expressed HM and will also immediately
impact nutrition best-practices for feeding premature infant and milk banking protocols."

Short gut syndrome (SGS) results from surgery that removes a significant length of small intestine in response
to different conditions, like necrotizing enterocolitis. In children, the mortality associated with SGS is ~25%,
making it one of the most lethal conditions in infancy and childhood. After surgery, remodeling of the remaining
bowel segment can facilitate absorptive function and survival. Nonetheless, some patients require long-term
parenteral nutrition. Beyond loss of absorptive capacity, a significant complication in SGS patients that survive
bowel resection is intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD), regardless of whether patients receive
nutrition enterally or parenterally. Clinically, therapies designed to target IFALD after SGS remain elusive. In
the first round of funding of this continuation application, The Warner and Randolph lab have shown in mouse
models of small bowel resection that gut-derived LPS transiting to the liver from the portal vein initiatesTLR4
signaling in liver macrophages that ultimately drives onset of fibrosis. A significant break on LPS-TLR4
interaction occurred by the binding and neutralization of gut-derived LPS to portal vein high density lipoprotein
(HDL). HDL is synthesized in the liver and is also generated by enterocytes in the mice or human ileum, where
it depends on expression of the polypeptide apoA1 and the lipid transporter ABCA1 that donates the first lipids
to the nascent HDL particle. Loss of enterocyte ABCA1 greatly reduced portal vein HDL, allowing for enhanced
LPS activity to reach the liver and exacerbate liver injury after small bowel resection. Conversely, when we
increased intestinal HDL by giving the liver X receptor (LXR) agonist GW9365 orally at a low dose to trigger
HDL production in the intestine but avoid direct LXR agonism of the liver, the drug was effective in reducing the
onset of liver fibrosis in a manner that was dependent upon enterocyte-derived ABCA1. These findings raise
the concept that intestinal epithelial activation of the transcription factor LXR may provide therapeutic benefit
toward treating IFALD. This grant is designed to consider this concept with the intent to further define the role
of LXR and HDL in protecting the liver in SGS models and to move in a translational direction that may support
later clinical development of a therapeutic to treat IFALD. We will study how LXR agonism protects the liver in
a mouse model of SGS using a novel orally restricted LXR agonist compound WUSTL0717 synthesized by
Principal Investigator Elgendy. Pharmacokinetic analysis in mice reveals that WUSTL0717 is indeed restricted
to the intestine. To further consider the translational potential of WUSTL0717, Principal Investigator Ajay Jain
will provide expertise in SGS studied in piglets. One major advantage of incorporating a piglet model into
studies of SGS is that piglets can be provided parenteral nutrition like humans and thus model aspects of the
disease not easily studied in mice. Dr. Jain has shown that parenteral nutrition in piglets leads to bacterial
overgrowth in the small bowel, resulting in increased LPS translocation to the liver and thereby recapitulating
the scenario and possible mechanisms described above in mice."
10879218,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Children with high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) have a significant risk of treatment failure and death emphasizing
the need to develop novel targeted therapies, which constitutes the long-term goal of this proposal. The proposed
research focuses on the oncoprotein glypican-2 (GPC2), which is glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked to the
cell surface of NBs and other cancers but is not found on vital normal tissues. To capitalize on GPC2’s differential
expression, we developed GPC2 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and performed Investigational New
Drug (IND) application-enabling studies in NB showing that GPC2 CARs induce safe and robust tumor
regression. These data led directly to the development of a first-in-human GPC2 CAR T cell Phase 1 clinical trial
that opened in May 2023. However, NB cells can escape GPC2 CAR pressure leading to tumor relapse and
limiting long-term efficacy. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify the mechanisms of GPC2 CAR T cell
resistance in NB and develop next-generation CAR approaches to combat these processes. Towards this goal,
our recent profiling of tumors that escaped GPC2 CAR pressure showed that NB relapse is associated with
GPC2 downregulation and conversely upregulation of the GPI-cleaving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).
We have also found that GPC2 is a major component of NB-associated extracellular vesicles (EVs), modulation
of which can significantly change GPC2 cell surface density. Together, our published and unpublished
preliminary data suggest the following central hypothesis: A major mechanism of GPC2 CAR T cell resistance
in NB is downregulation of cell surface GPC2 driven both by ACE-induced GPC2 cleavage and increased
shedding of GPC2+ EVs and can be circumvented by a new bicistronic CAR dual antigen targeting approach.
We propose to test this original concept in two integrated but independent Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we focus on
validating GPC2 cell surface downregulation as a major mechanism of GPC2 CAR resistance in NB, including
defining the role of ACE-induced GPC2 cleavage and the dynamic modulation of GPC2+ EVs under GPC2 CAR
pressure. In Aim 2, we will define the efficacy and safety of a new CAR T cell dual antigen targeting approach
we designed to overcome GPC2 CAR escape in NB; GPC2 CAR T cells simultaneously targeting the
disialoganglioside GD2 via a secreted bispecific innate immune cell engager (BiCE) that also binds CD16a on
NK cells and macrophages to activate antitumor innate immunity in a GPC2-independent manner. This
innovative CAR.BiCE therapeutic approach synergizes dual antigen targeting and activating adaptive and innate
immunity. Our results will yield critical insights into CAR T cell resistance and these new immunotherapeutic
principles and technology can be applied to other potent CARs where antigen escape limits long-term efficacy.
These studies will also produce IND application-enabling data for the clinical translational of a CAR.BiCE
therapeutic approach to develop desperately needed new targeted therapies for children with NB."

residents with chronic diseases such as cancer, obesity, diabetes, and COVID-19."
10899971,"Project Summary/Abstract
Simultaneous use of alcohol and cannabis, or co-use (i.e., the use of both substances so that effects overlap),
is an increasingly significant public health concern among young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 in the
U.S. Compared to single substance use occasions of alcohol and cannabis, co-use occasions are associated
with greater negative consequences, including driving under the influence and blacking out. Given the steady
increase in the prevalence of co-use among young adults, there is a pressing need to understand factors
related to co-use that could inform intervention efforts in this population. Protective behavioral strategies (PBS;
i.e., tactics used to modify or limit substance use related harm) have been robustly linked to fewer
consequences (e.g., lower use quantity, frequency, and consequences) for alcohol- and cannabis-only
occasions. However, research has not examined PBS in the context of co-use occasions, despite a burgeoning
literature supporting that co-use occasions are associated with greater harms. Consequently, the goal of this
proposal is to examine the extent that alcohol and cannabis PBS are used and associated with alcohol and
cannabis use outcomes on co-use occasions relative to alcohol- and cannabis-only occasions. The proposed
research will conduct secondary data analyses of a NIH-funded project using ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) data collected from 123 college students over four consecutive weekends (Thursday-
Sunday; 16 total days). The proposed research has three specific aims: 1) To assess whether alcohol and
cannabis PBS are used more frequently on alcohol- or cannabis-only occasions relative to co-use occasions;
(2) To determine whether alcohol and cannabis PBS are associated with levels of alcohol use, cannabis use,
and consequences experienced on alcohol- and cannabis-only occasions relative to co-use occasions; and (3)
To identify daily factors (environmental context, social setting) related to alcohol and cannabis PBS on alcohol-
and cannabis-only occasions relative to co-use occasions. Findings from the proposal will inform our
understanding of alcohol and cannabis PBS during co-use occasions, including proximal factors (i.e., social
setting and environment) that impact the use of PBS. In alignment with the NIAAA strategic plan, findings will
help develop and improve strategies to reduce and prevent harms associated with co-use, particularly those
that may be delivered in-the-moment. Additionally, the proposed research would provide the applicant with
training that will inform her developing program of research on the association between co-use and PBS
among young adults through providing content training on alcohol and co-use behaviors among young adults,
ecological research methods, intensive longitudinal data analyses, and professional development activities."
10900059,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aging is the greatest risk factor for vascular dementia, the second most common cause of dementia after
Alzheimer disease (AD). Vascular dementia comprises a large proportion of AD-related dementias, or ADRD.
Vascular dementia is the result of poor vascular perfusion of the brain and can occur as a result of ischemic
stroke, particularly in elderly individuals. The mechanisms underlying the greater risk of vascular dementia in
elderly stroke patients are unclear thus limiting discovery of therapeutic approaches. Studies have shown a
significant post-stroke inflammatory response in the aging ischemic brain that can persist and contribute to
cognitive decline. However, the nature of this persistent immune response, particularly the adaptive T cell
component, is not well characterized and the functions of brain-infiltrating T cells are not well established,
especially in the context of aging. Therefore, this proposal will characterize late T cell responses to stroke in a
mouse model of age-related post-stroke dementia. Aged stroke mice demonstrate a significant cognitive
impairment that is accompanied by T cell infiltration in the post-stroke brain. As T cells undergo vast changes
in immune repertoire and function with aging, it is likely that T cells that traffic to and reside in the post-stroke
brain will have distinct functions that contribute to age-related differences in long-term stroke outcomes. This
research proposal aims to (1) Use single cell T cell receptor and immune response gene sequencing to
characterize infiltrating T cells in the aging ischemic hemisphere (Aim 1); (2) Utilize Seahorse bioenergetics,
metabolomics, and T cell activation assays to identify age-related differences in T cell metabolism which fuel T
cell activation and T cell function (Aim 2); (3) Test the extent to which excessive innate immune responses
characteristic of aging stroke contribute to T cell-mediated cognitive decline, and determine the therapeutic
potential of acutely inhibiting innate immunity to confer a more favorable adaptive immune response (Aim 3).
Understanding how age-related changes in T cells contribute to chronic stroke outcomes will ultimately provide
us with novel therapeutics for elderly patients of vascular dementia."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Flow Cytometry Shared Resource (FCSR) supports the goals of the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center
(VICC) by providing state-of-the-art equipment and expertise to analyze and sort individual cells for VICC
members. The FCSR works closely with VICC members to efficiently develop and refine their experiments
involving flow cytometry on cancer-related samples. Cells and tissues isolated from the various cancer milieus
require specialized techniques and skills to optimize assays and interpret data, which the FCSR possesses. The
overall strategy and goals of the FCSR are guided and developed to meet the needs of the VICC members,
specifically as a major user component and scientific catalyst at Vanderbilt. A key component of the shared
resource is the expertise that has been developed over the past 10 years within the team. This team is able to
keep the cytometers running at maximal efficiency and assist users to ensure the success of both analytical and
sorting cytometry. The staff is very proud of our educational service, as we are able to train students, fellows and
faculty to use the cytometers to ensure rigor and reproducibility, while also providing 24/7 access. New service
lines include optimization of cell sorting for single cell RNAseq in conjunction with the Genome Sciences Shared
Resource (GSSR). In addition, the FCSR has acquired a four laser Cytek Aurora spectral cytometer that is
capable of 24 color analysis. We expect during the next funding cycle to add additional spectral cytometers to
enable lower cost deep phenotyping of cells requiring up to 30-35 markers. We also plan to add a spectral flow
cytometer with sorting capabilities to allow deep analysis of tumor samples and sorting of tumor cells and/or cells
from the microenvironment (immune or stromal) using a single panel of antibodies. These new acquisitions allow
the FCSR and VICC members to stay at the cutting edge of cell phenotyping and isolation."
10900651,"CORE 008 – GENOME EDITING SHARED RESOURCE
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The mission of the Genome Editing Shared Resource (GESR), previously the Transgenic Mouse/Embryonic
Stem Cell Shared Resource, is to enable the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) research community,
inclusive of our VICC members and partners at Meharry Medical College, Tennessee State University, and other
NCI Cancer Centers to efficiently generate, store and share genetically-altered mouse models. GESR, which
has been in existence for over 25 years, has undergone major changes over the past five years. Five prior
service lines oriented around gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) became unnecessary after
the discovery of CRISPR/Cas9. Thus, in late 2015, GESR shifted its focus towards improving the efficiency and
outcomes of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in one and two cell mouse embryos. Since then, over 800
mutant mice from 97 CRISPR/Cas9 experiments have been generated, with a 100% technical success rate for
the past twenty-six projects. GESR now provides a full-service approach where the resource performs project
design, pre-injection reagent validation, post-injection analysis of the resulting pups, and breeding of the first
generation to provide the investigator with a correctly edited heterozygous mouse. Investigators no longer need
extensive molecular biology skills, or even much knowledge about CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing strategies. To
support the sharing of these new CRISPR-generated lines, GESR has become more proactive in encouraging
the use of core cryopreservation services. In house cryopreservation of mouse lines improves colony
management and enables specific pathogen free stocks to be sent as cryopreserved germplasm to other
institutions. The resource continues to reconstitute cryopreserved mouse lines that are requested by VICC
investigators from other investigators, or that exist within external repositories, by performing both in vitro
fertilization and embryo transfer. Finally, the resource has established, and are striving to expand, a Vanderbilt
Cryopreserved Mouse Repository (VCMR). The VCMR facilitates compliance with NIH Mouse Sharing Policies
and enables storage and distribution of mice from Vanderbilt without the continued involvement of investigators.
All microinjection and embryo transfer services are performed in a specific pathogen free barrier facility.
Together, the combination of services provided by the GESR enables VICC members and other Vanderbilt
investigators to efficiently generate and maintain novel genome-edited mouse models to study multiple aspects
of cell and tumor biology using sophisticated mouse models."

10900654,"CORE 010 – IMMUNOPHENOTYPING SHARED RESOURCE
SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The mission of the Immunophenotyping Shared Resource (IPSR) is to advance immuno-oncological
translational research projects by providing a rigorous platform to assess the immunological impact of anti-cancer
therapy and deepen mechanistic understanding of cancer immunology. During the current project period there
has been an explosion in our knowledge of host-tumor interactions and the mechanisms by which cancer cells
evade host immune-surveillance. Fully a third of the clinical trials underway at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer
Center (VICC) include an immuno-oncology component. Immune tumor infiltrates, the immuno-
microenvironment, and the patient immune state are rapidly becoming standard biomarkers for patient selection,
yet most clinical investigators do not have wet laboratory capabilities to define the immunophenotype of the
tumor or the host. As a result, there is a critical need for a centralized Shared Resource to coordinate and perform
comprehensive analysis of the immune cell repertoire and state (“immunophenotyping”) from clinical trial and
preclinical biospecimens. To meet this need, we developed a highly integrated platform to drive and manage
comprehensive immunophenotyping by adding capabilities to the former Antibody Production Shared Resource
(APSR), thus enabling deep immune analysis in the newly evolved IPSR. High-quality antibodies are necessary
for immunophenotyping, so this transition leverages the existing expertise in multiple antibody technologies while
broadening the scope of work to include immunophenotyping. The immune analyses will be conducted in
collaboration with several existing VICC Shared Resources including the Flow Cytometry Shared Resource
(FCSR) for analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow samples and/or dissociated tumor samples; the
Translational Pathology Shared Resource (TPSR) for multi-immunofluorescence analysis of solid tumor
samples; and the Genomic Sciences Shared Resource (GSSR) for deep sequencing of neoepitopes and single
cell RNAseq analysis. The IPSR staff work closely with clinical, basic and population sciences investigators to
design experimental approach, and to rigorously interpret resulting data, thus providing these investigators a
“one stop shop” for coordinating immunophenotyping. The IPSR is co-led by three established faculty members
with a wealth of experience in performing highly complex immunological assays. Collectively, their extensive
knowledge in immunologic assays, immuno-oncology, single cell biology, genomics, host-tumor interactions, and
use of clinically derived biospecimens makes their expertise critical to the success of the Shared Resource.
During the current project period IPSR collaborations included 274 laboratory projects with 161 unique
investigators across seven VICC Research Programs that have been recognized by 40 publications."

achievement of the SBSR is reflected in the service utilization and publications. The SBSR supports multiple
studies that are recruiting participants, collecting survey data and/or biospecimens, or performing biological
assays on collected samples. Twenty-six VICC members have benefited from the services of the resource to
improve study design and research quality. VICC members with peer-reviewed support account for 91% and
98% of total service usage for the laboratory services and survey services, respectively. This shared resource
has supported the publication of over 200 cancer-related manuscripts published since 2015 including in journals
such as JAMA, Nature, Nature Genetics, JNCI and Cancer Research. Through the implementation and sharing
of best practices, the SBSR staff demonstrates to users the effectiveness of a rigorous approach to the conduct
of population-based research, which enables individual investigators, students, fellows and staff to better
incorporate these practices into their research programs. Thus, the SBSR services are critical for the research
conducted by VICC members across multiple VICC research programs."

10900661,"PROJECT 003 – HOST-TUMOR INTERACTIONS RESEARCH PROGRAM
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Host-Tumor Interactions Research Program (HT) consists of basic and translational scientists focused on
discovering the interactions between tumor cells and their host and developing strategies to interrupt those
interactions to target and control tumor progression and metastasis. The central premise of HT is that tumor
growth, invasion and metastasis, as well as the tumor's response to therapies, depend on interactions between
cancer, stromal and immune cells with the matrix and factors in the tumor microenvironment. The long-term
scientific goal of HT is to develop a detailed mechanistic understanding of not just the tumor cell, but also all the
components of the tumor microenvironment that influence cancer and the response to cancer therapies. These
interactions are best studied by integrating knowledge and paradigms from many disciplines in addition to basic
science cancer biology, including immunology, single cell analyses, computation and mathematical modeling
and novel imaging strategies. In this renewal, HT has leveraged the strengths of its membership to explicitly
incorporate individuals with immunology, modeling and imaging expertise to rigorously investigate the aims of
HT, which are to:
 1. Identify molecules and mechanisms through which tumors evade the immune system and establish how
 anti-tumor immune responses can be enhanced to eliminate tumors using novel immunotherapies.
 2. Discover cellular and molecular interactions between the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells to
 better understand the complexity of cell populations and stromal interactions in tumors
 3. Utilize and develop new imaging and computational tools based on the molecular and biochemical
 characteristics of cancer cells and tumors
To enable these goals, we will establish dynamic, multi-disciplinary collaborations and educational opportunities

10900663,"PROJECT 005 – GASTROINTESTINAL CANCER RESEARCH PROGRAM
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Taken together, gastrointestinal cancers (GI cancers) kill more patients per year than cancers from any other
organ system. In 2019, 328,030 new GI cancers will be diagnosed, resulting in 165,460 deaths in the US.
Additionally, many of the GI cancers are rising in incidence for a variety of reasons, such as the aging population,
inflammation (pancreatic, gastric and esophageal cancers), human papillomavirus (anal cancer), hepatitis C,
and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hepatocellular cancer), as well as unknown causes (neuroendocrine cancers).
Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) has prioritized GI cancers into a research program because these
diseases and their risk factors are more common and lethal in the catchment area, as well as the strength of
VICC investigators in this field of research. Throughout its existence, the Gastrointestinal Cancer Research
Program (GI) has been built on two core strengths: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and the role of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in the pathogenesis of gastric
cancer (GC). GI investigators continue to define mechanisms of resistance to EGFR targeted therapies and
methods to overcome this resistance. GI members are ideally suited to conduct microbiome research, particularly
H. pylori, its pathogenesis in GC, the differential sensitivity to H. Pylori carcinogenesis and the development of
methods to prevent these cancers. Building on this core, GI has expanded its research across the spectrum of
GI cancers, and members have extended their capabilities to understand, diagnose, prevent and treat GI cancers
through intra-, inter-programmatic, and extramural collaborations. GI members seek to continue the Program's
strong, longstanding track record of success through the study of processes underlying etiology, pathogenesis
and progression; the exploration of the roles of infection, inflammation and immunity; studies of novel agents
and diagnostic imaging modalities, treatment resistance mechanisms and biomarkers to improve patient
outcomes; and translation of this new knowledge into clinical application. GI will also continue to mentor and
train the next generation of GI cancer scientists. GI co-Leaders Cathy Eng, MD and R. Daniel Beauchamp, MD
work to integrate the members' efforts within GI and VICC. They will work with GI members, other VICC research
programs and the shared resources to continue fostering collaboration and conduct high impact cancer research.
They will also encourage GI members to adopt and translate new technologies for greater clinical impact and
continue successful recruitment strategies to engage new investigators in strategic areas prioritized by the

RESEARCH PROGRAM
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Translational Research and Interventional Oncology Research Program (TR) is an integrated
transdisciplinary program that provides the opportunity for clinical investigators and laboratory scientists to
collaboratively address the rapidly changing landscape of cancer therapy. TR traverses multiple disciplines,
including precision oncology, clinical trials, cellular therapy, immuno-oncology and immune-toxicity, and TR
leaders aim to enhance the vital cross-fertilization across disparate fields that can improve oncologic practice.
Over the past five years, TR members have continued to lead large, multi-center clinical trials and have remained
scientifically productive with increased funding. The prior funding cycle has seen growth at both ends of that
spectrum in addition to strong productivity in terms of publications and federal grant funding. TR aspires to
promote and advance all facets of bi-directional translational oncology in solid and hematological malignancies
with the main purpose of optimizing patient outcomes that align with serving the needs of the Vanderbilt-Ingram
Cancer Center (VICC) catchment area and beyond. The specific aims are targeted to lead development and
implementation of practice-changing discoveries, including the oversight of clinical trials that are innovative,
investigator-initiated and/or accrue on national and international stages. The translational scientists in TR aim to
perform paradigm-shifting research that further informs the next generation of clinical trials. The advent of
immuno-oncology has identified a rapidly evolving unmet need to address the identification of patients at risk of
immune-toxicity and to standardize best practices for management of those toxicities. TR membership is well-
positioned to lead the field of immune-toxicity across the spectrum of checkpoint inhibitors, immune-cellular
therapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantations. There are 37 program members from seven departments and
two schools with $5.5M in total peer-reviewed funding and NCI making up 47% ($2.6M). Out of 826 publications,
16% are intra-programmatic and 24% are inter-programmatic. Members also have 546 collaborative publications
with investigators at other NCI-designated cancer centers."
10900666,"PROJECT 007 – CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY RESEARCH PROGRAM
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and many other countries around the
world. The Cancer Epidemiology Research Program (CE), directed by Xiao-Ou Shu, MD, PhD, and Wei Zheng,
MD, PhD, conducts high-impact research to improve the understanding of cancer etiology and identify
biomarkers for cancer risk and prognosis to inform the development of effective cancer prevention strategies.
The mission of CE is to create an optimal environment to facilitate the interaction and collaboration of
investigators conducting cancer epidemiology research, and to train the next generation of scientists. The
specific aims of CE are to: 1) identify biomarkers for cancer risk assessment and early detection; 2) identify
nutrition, lifestyle, and other environmental factors affecting cancer risk; 3) investigate biomarkers and lifestyle
factors for cancer prognoses; and 4) identify determinants of health disparities in cancer incidence and mortality.
One of the key strengths of CE lies in the establishment and conduct of three large cohort studies with extensive
exposure data and biospecimens obtained from 223,000 study participants. CE members also conduct large
cancer case-control studies and intervention trials and play major leadership roles in the Vanderbilt DNA
Databank (BioVU), which contains extensive electronic health records and DNA samples collected from
~250,000 patients. Recently, CE members helped launch the national All of Us Research Program with a goal
to enroll one million participants across the US and lead its Data and Research Support Center. These resources
have provided, and will continue to provide, extraordinary population-based field laboratories for scientific
discoveries. CE members are at the forefront of identifying genetic and lifestyle factors and biomarkers for the
risk and progression of multiple cancers, with research that has significantly advanced our knowledge of cancer
etiology and contributed to the modification of multiple guidelines and recommendations for cancer prevention.
Most of the research within CE focuses on cancers that are directly relevant to the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer
Center catchment area, and involves participation by multiple segments of this population, including historically
underrepresented groups. CE members play a leadership role in multiple large cancer epidemiology consortia
and direct large international studies to test scientific hypotheses that cannot be adequately investigated in US-
based studies. CE hosts five NIH-funded training programs and has successfully fostered the career
development of more than 10 junior investigators. There are 24 program members from six departments and
two schools, with $13.5M in total peer-reviewed funding and NCI making up 67% ($9.0M). Out of 586
publications, 53% are intra-programmatic and 18% are inter-programmatic. Members also have 387
collaborative publications with investigators at other NCI-designated cancer centers."
10900768,"A central question in behavioral biology is how environmental and genetic factors shape behavioral traits,
allowing for substantial individuality. Homeostatic behaviors like feeding and food preferences are prime
examples of genetic predispositions interacting with the food environment to produce diverse feeding habits.
However, these programs are further modified by host-associated microbes, suggesting the overall systems
controlling behavioral phenotype is far more complex than first anticipated. The critical questions that remain
to be addressed are: to what extent do host-microbe interactions contribute to individual differences in behavior?
Specifically, how does gene regulation of behavior operate in the context of host-microbe symbiosis? Implicit in
this question is the hypothesis that perturbation of host-microbe symbiosis results in aberrant behavioral
outcomes in certain individuals or populations, a topic fundamental to human health yet unsolved.
 The goal of my research program is to define how behaviors are shaped by host-microbe interactions.
My lab studies foraging and food choice behaviors in the fly Drosophila melanogaster, using a gnotobiotic system
I developed that permits precise configuration of the fly microbiome. I hypothesize that feeding behavior and
food preferences are the product of host genetics-microbiome interactions, which determine, in part, an
individual’s long-term health. Our recent data show that foraging and diet selection preferences vary by the
microbiome, and altering the microbiome triggers transcriptional changes in specific cell clusters within the fly
brain, involving genes predicted to affect behavior. In this five-year plan, I will leverage fly genetics and state-
of-the-art genomics and metabolomics tools to identify the gene regulatory networks and mechanisms
underlying microbial modulation of host behavior. Expected outcomes include comprehensive gut endocrine
signaling and inter-organ communication maps at single-cell transcriptome scale and metabolite-gene
interactions networks. The causal effects of microbiome-responsive genes, neuropeptides, and metabolites on
host feeding behavior and food preferences will be revealed. Since we know little about how the interplay of
host genetics and microbiome contribute to complex behavior, my research has the potential to advance
fundamental knowledge in behavioral genetics but also to identify genes or processes that may function
similarly in Drosophila and mammals as targets to treat behavioral disorders, such as eating disorders and obesity."
10894751,"Abstract
The transcription factor NF-κB is critically important for tumorigenesis and therapeutic resistance but we have
been unable to successfully target it for clinical treatment due to its equally important roles in physiology and
host defense in particular. Teasing apart these functions of NF-κB will overcome this barrier resulting in a
powerful means to fight cancer. While the core mechanism driving NF-κB activation has been well defined and
is the same under most physiological and oncogenic conditions, the mechanistic difference in physiological vs.
oncogenic NF-κB still remains a conundrum. Recently, we have demonstrated, for the first time, that extrinsic/
inflammatory and intrinsic/oncogenic signals induce different activation patterns and different forms of NF-κB in
normal lung cells and lung cancer cells. Moreover, we have identified, also for the first time, the PDZ-LIM
domain-containing protein PDLIM2 that selectively suppresses the ‘oncogenic’ but not ‘physiologic’ activation
of NF-κB and can be targeted as mono- or combination therapy in murine models of lung cancer. Based on
these novel discoveries, in this proposal we will determine the molecular mechanisms by which PDLIM2 acts
as a determinant of NF-κB function. We will also dissect the roles and molecular mechanisms of this regulation
of the ‘oncogenic’ and ‘physiologic’ activation of NF-κB in lung tumorigenesis and physiological host defense
against pulmonary infection. These studies are significant, because we know NF-κB is a strong tumor promoter
linked to almost all human cancers but cannot currently be targeted in the clinic given its physiological importance. Also, these studies have both conceptual and technical innovations regarding NF-κB and cancer,
since they open new avenues to study the differential regulation and action of NF-κB in cancer and physiology,
and may lead to new clinically feasible approaches to selectively target pathogenic NF-κB for cancer therapy."
10894822,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although cigarette smoking is the major environmental risk factor for COPD, only a minority of smokers develops
clinically significant COPD; genetic factors influence this variability. COPD subjects have widely varying
contributions of emphysema and airway disease, and the biological determinants of COPD heterogeneity are
not well-defined. Protein biomarkers, which are biologically proximate to genetic variants, could play a critical
intermediate role in defining COPD genetics and heterogeneity. Our overall hypothesis is that functional genetic
variants lead to abnormal proteomic states that will allow identification of protein biomarkers relevant for the
development and heterogeneity of COPD. We will use mass spectrometry proteomics to provide comprehensive
assessment of available proteins and their proteoforms (including post-translational modifications) in 1054 lung
tissue samples from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC), including 547 COPD cases and 507 control
subjects. Olink proteomics data (generated by TOPMed) will provide orthogonal proteomics data on the same
lung tissue biospecimens. Cellular deconvolution approaches using single cell and bulk RNA-Seq data will be
used to determine whether proteomic associations relate to changes in lung cellular composition. COPD
subtypes will be defined based on both clinical/imaging data and by using network-based stratification of the
proteomics data. We will verify potential plasma protein biomarkers of COPD and COPD subtypes by measuring
the top 100 lung tissue COPD-specific proteins in plasma samples from the same LTRC COPD cases and control
subjects. We will leverage existing LTRC multi-Omics data (including whole genome sequencing, RNA-Seq, and
DNA methylation) in conjunction with newly generated mass spectrometry and affinity-based proteomics data to
identify rare and common genetic determinants of COPD-related proteins and COPD. Machine learning and
network analysis will be used to integrate multi-Omics data to provide insight into COPD pathogenesis and
heterogeneity. Network relationships for several top COPD protein biomarkers will be functionally validated using
CRISPR-Cas9 approaches in primary lung cells. The identification and characterization of novel COPD protein
biomarkers may provide insights into COPD pathogenesis and tools for future clinical trials."
10894895,"Project Summary/Abstract
The overall objective of this project, entitled “Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy Training for Cancer Care
Providers” (MCPT), is to continue facilitate the implementation and dissemination of Meaning-Centered
Psychotherapy (MCP), a Research-Tested Intervention Program (RTIP) through a multi-modal training program
for cancer care clinicians. There is extensive evidence demonstrating a need for interventions targeting
depression, hopelessness, loss of meaning and spiritual and existential distress in patients coping with the
challenges of advanced cancer. To address this need, Breitbart and colleagues developed MCP as an innovative
and novel intervention to enhance meaning and reduce despair in advanced cancer patients living in the face of
death. Since our National Institute of Health (NIH) R25 grant was funded, we have successfully developed MCPT
and trained 297 clinicians from a wide variety of clinical institutions and settings. As proposed, we utilized the
RE-AIM framework, comprised of five distinct factors: 1) Reach, 2) Efficacy, 3) Adoption, 4) Implementation, and
5) Maintenance, to evaluate the impact of the MCPT program on the translation of MCP into clinical practice.
Preliminary results indicate that trainees are extremely satisfied with the MCPT program, have become proficient
in the delivery of MCP, have successfully implemented MCP in their own clinical settings, and are maintaining
or improving their MCP skills post-training. We are applying for a 5-year renewal of this R25 grant to capitalize
on overwhelming interest expressed by cancer care clinicians in our innovative, immersive training and to further
disseminate MCP to advanced cancer patients in need of evidence-based psychosocial care. We will offer this
training to an additional 336 clinicians during years 6-10 and enhance the follow-up components of the training
to further improve MCP skill maintenance, adoption, and implementation in clinical practice. This will also enable
us to continue to collect data on the implementation of MCP with patients in the “real world” across diverse
clinical settings. The long-term goal of this project is to disseminate MCP to a wide variety of cancer and palliative
care treatment settings through the training of a large, diverse cadre of clinicians. Thus, the specific aims of this
study are to: Aim 1: Provide and further develop a training program in MCP for cancer care clinicians from
multiple disciplines who provide psycho-oncology and psychosocial palliative care services for cancer patients;
Aim 2: Evaluate trainees’ MCP skill acquisition through facilitators’ ratings of MCPT participants and participants’
satisfaction with the program and adoption, implementation, and maintenance of skills; and Aim 3: Evaluate the
impact of enhanced follow-up training and engagement in MCP community activities on MCP implementation
and skill maintenance."

10873577,"How the human pathogen Mycoplasma pneumoniae attenuates virulence factor production during growth as
biofilm towers, and how this attenuation favors chronic respiratory disease, including both pneumonia and
asthma, are unknown. Our long-term goal is to understand the processes that are essential for establishing and
maintaining M. pneumoniae infection. The overall objective of this application is to understand how M. pneu-
moniae biofilm towers chronically infect respiratory epithelial host cells at an air-liquid interface (ALI). Our
central hypothesis is that the reduction in virulence factor production by M. pneumoniae bacteria in biofilm
towers is signaled by decreased O2 levels and results in minimization of both defensive responses and damage to
the epithelium. The rationale underlying these experiments is that once the extent to which damage is limited
by changes to M. pneumoniae during biofilm tower growth and maintenance is understood, approaches that
counter the scheme of limiting host responses could be developed as therapeutic agents to reduce morbidity
associated with chronic M. pneumoniae infection. We plan to test our central hypothesis by pursuing the follow-
ing two specific aims: 1) characterize the development and impact of M. pneumoniae biofilms in a respiratory
epithelial air-liquid interface tissue culture model; and 2) determine the role of O2 in regulating M. pneumoniae
gene expression and steady-state levels of virulence-associated proteins in vitro. For the first aim, we will char-
acterize the impact of M. pneumoniae biofilm towers on airway epithelia in an ALI tissue culture model using
microscopy, transcriptomics of the host cells, and measurements of epithelial barrier function like transepithelial
electrical resistance, ciliation, and localization of the ZO-1 tight junction protein, comparing these effects to those
produced by CARDS toxin and H2O2, toxic molecules whose production is attenuated in M. pneumoniae during
biofilm tower growth. For the second aim, prompted by preliminary data about the decreased activity of the
H2O2-producing enzyme glycerol 3-phosphate oxidase in M. pneumoniae grown in low O2, we will investigate
the bacterial response to growth in 10% O2 at the levels of transcription a global level, and, for select virulence-
associated proteins, steady-state abundance. The proposed research is innovative, in our opinion, because it
represents a substantive departure from the status quo by focusing on how M. pneumoniae both responds to and
impacts its environment within a biofilm context, using biofilm tower growth in an ALI airway epithelial model
and studying gene regulation in a biofilm environment. This contribution will be significant because it is expected
to direct future research efforts toward development of therapeutic intervention strategies targeting M. pneu-
moniae biofilms. Additionally, the work in this AREA proposal will provide training in fundamental microbio-
logical, transcriptomic, and tissue culture techniques for 4-5 undergraduate and a graduate student with career
interests in particular areas of biomedical research, with a significant effort to include underrepresented minor-

10874436,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Tobacco use remains the most important cause of morbidity and premature mortality in the United
States. Young adults have high smoking rates and low use of evidence-based smoking cessation services.
Smartphones are widely used among young adults and offer a promising strategy to deliver smoking cessation
treatment to a large, diverse audience of young adult smokers. Available smoking cessation apps for
smartphones are rarely evidence-based and able to deliver intervention content that is tailored to the specific
needs of the individual smoker. Little is known how smartphone-based interventions need to be designed and
what kind of tailored intervention content they should deliver.
 While there is evidence for the efficacy of both Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Mindfulness/
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) smoking cessation interventions, it is unclear if these approaches
are efficacious when implemented in real-time and with young adults. The overall goal of this proposal is to
evaluate the efficacy of CBT and ACT-based messages for young adults targeted at specific high-risk
situations for smoking.
 Our team has experience in using smartphones and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to
understand situational predictors of smoking in everyday life, and smoking cessation trials with young adults
using Facebook. We have demonstrated feasibility of determining high-risk situations for smoking and
delivering tailored messages based on geofence triggers.
 The specific aims are to: 1) To test CBT and Mindfulness/ACT intervention message efficacy for
reducing momentary smoking urges. We will conduct a micro-randomized trial (within-subject randomization) to
test the efficacy of CBT and Mindfulness/ACT compared to control messages for reducing smoking urge 15
minutes after message delivery. 2) To test if exposure to urge reduction messages results in changes in
smoking behavior over time compared to an EMA only control group. A control group of participants that will
complete EMA only without intervention messages will allow us to test, if messages reduce cigarettes per day
at end of treatment, 3-, and 6-months follow-up. 3) Explore moderation effects of substance co-use (cannabis,
alcohol, other drugs) and exposure to specific location (home, work, bars) on urge reduction message efficacy.
Among intervention group participants, we will explore how message efficacy may be moderated by substance
co-use and exposure to specific settings.
 Smoking onset is now more common among young adults than adolescents and early cessation
substantially reduces morbidity and mortality from smoking, making age-appropriate, tailored, and scalable
interventions for this high priority population ever more important."
10874439,"Circadian rhythms regulate a wide spectrum of biological processes of critical importance for organismal
health. Perturbations of those rhythms underlie many pathologies including systemic inflammation, depression,
and neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, circadian rhythms are driven by intrinsic oscillatory changes in gene
expression that are orchestrated by several regulators of gene transcription and mRNA translation forming the
core oscillator circuitry. Those key regulators, most importantly the non-redundant transcription/translation
factor BMAL1/ARNTL, are active in most cells throughout the body and undergo circadian entrainment by
external time cues such as light or feeding. At the organismal level, the pro-rhythmic role of the oscillator is
widely recognized as a critical contributor to homeostasis. BMAL1 effects that are independent of the central
rhythm include anti-oxidant protection in the brain, life span regulation, contributions to atherosclerosis and
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-sensitization of cancer cells. Those, or similar, tissue-specific functions of
BMAL1 may affect the outcome after SCI. However, clock function at the molecular level has never been
investigated in the context of SCI. Unexpectedly, we found that: (i) moderate contusive thoracic SCI
upregulates BMAL1 in penumbral oligodendrocytes (OLs), coinciding with induction of the ER stress response
(ERSR)-activated pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP and ER stress-mediated apoptosis of OLs, (ii) after
SCI, Bmal1-/- mice show improved locomotor recovery and white matter sparing (WMS), as well as selective
downregulation of Chop and its pro-apoptotic target gene death receptor 5 (Dr5) and reduced blood
extravasation and inflammation, with extensive changes in microglia/macrophage (MM) and endothelial (EC)-
specific gene expression. Also, pharmacological enhancement of the negative feedback inhibition of BMAL1
reduces ER stress toxicity in OPC cultures. These exciting findings suggest a novel role of BMAL1 in the
pathogenesis of SCI which may include OL-cell autonomous regulation of CHOP-mediated OL apoptosis
and/or EC/MM-cell autonomous modulation of post-SCI hemorrhage/vascular dysfunction/cytotoxic neuro-
inflammation. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis that BMAL1 regulates OL, EC, and/or MM gene expression
that contributes to SCI-associated white matter loss and impaired locomotor recovery. To test this hypothesis,
we will: (i) determine the cell autonomous roles of OL-, MM-, and EC-BMAL1 in SCI-associated white matter
damage and locomotor recovery, (ii) identify mechanism(s) that underlie BMAL1-mediated enhancement of
SCI-driven white matter loss, and (iii) evaluate mediators of the negative feedback inhibition of BMAL1 as
pharmacological targets for interventions to reduce SCI-associated white matter loss and locomotor
impairment. We will use a moderate T9 SCI contusion model in wild type or cell type-selective Bmal1-/- mice
and non-toxic, CNS-permeable drugs targeting the feedback regulation of BMAL1. This research may uncover
novel, previously unrecognized contributions of BMAL1 to `secondary tissue injury after SCI."
10874442,"Trauma and chronic stress results in a multitude of adverse behavioral and physiological outcomes, leading to
increased morbidity/mortality and impaired social and occupational functioning. Servicemembers and Veterans
experience exceptionally high rates of trauma exposure, which can precipitate and/or exacerbate subsequent
neuropsychiatric disorders (i.e., psychopathology). Most often repetitive in nature, blast exposure (via detonation
of high explosives) represents a major source of trauma for Servicemembers, often resulting in mild traumatic
brain injury (mTBI, the “signature injury” of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars) that is highly comorbid with PTSD,
depression, and addiction
. An estimated 400,000 Veterans have a history of blast mTBI, but prophylactic
approaches, other than protective gear, do not yet exist, and treatment options have limited efficacy. Stress can
result in aversion/dysphoria (a profound state of unease or dissatisfaction), mediated largely through activation
of the endogenous dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system and subsequent maladaptive changes within
the mesolimbic system. This KOR-mediated dysfunction is thought to underlie the ability of stress to precipitate
and/or exacerbate psychopathology related to PTSD, depression, and addiction, but the dynorphin/KOR system
has not been examined as a potential mediator of blast-induced pathology. Critically, KOR antagonists are
currently under clinical trial investigation in the civilian population for treatment of stress-related
psychopathology, but the potential of these drugs in a blast exposure setting has not yet been examined.
Negative affect and executive dysfunction are commonly reported following blast mTBI, leading to decreased
quality of life and potential risk for addictive-like behaviors, but the underlying mechanisms are not well
understood. Preclinical research efforts using rodent models of blast mTBI can provide much needed insight into
underlying mechanisms and provide an essential arena for early-stage testing of potential therapeutic
compounds. Building upon the strong foundation established during my VA BLR&D Career Development Award
2 (CDA2) funding, goals will be accomplished through three integrated Specific Aims: 1) to determine whether
KOR activation is required for blast mTBI-induced impulsivity and behavioral inflexibility (i.e., executive
dysfunction). 2) to evaluate whether KOR activation is required for blast mTBI-induced mesolimbic dysfunction.
3) to establish therapeutic efficacy of KOR antagonism administered chronically following blast mTBI. These
proposed studies will define, for the first time, the role of KOR activation in adverse blast mTBI outcomes and
highlight this receptor system as a novel therapeutic target. Knowledge gained can be directly translated and
utilized towards the development of more effective treatment approaches for Servicemembers and Veterans with
a history of blast mTBI."
10874566,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The rising incidence in early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC diagnosed before 50), has resulted in updated
American Cancer Society (ACS) guideline advising average-risk screening begin at age 45, rather than 50.
Debates centered around the substantial cost and resources of adding 21 million adults at very low risk to the
screening pool, and “further personalize screening strategies” was a priority. Identifying the contributors of the
rising incidence are the first steps but thus far an unmet need. Lifestyle factors that preceded and mirrored the
rapid rise of early-onset CRC, including obesity, prolong sitting, and poor diet, may play a critical role. Our
preliminary data support the importance of obesity and sedentary behaviors and early-onset CRC are more likely
to be processed from traditional adenoma-carcinoma sequence compared to CRC diagnosed after age 65.
Therefore, investigation into risk factors for early-onset advanced adenoma, the major targets of screening, will
illuminate insights of colorectal carcinogenesis at younger ages. Accumulating data suggest that microbial
translocation/endotoxemia, which triggers subsequent inflammation and immune response, and augmented by
above-mentioned lifestyle factors, might be an emerging pathway. We hypothesized that obesity, prolonged
sitting, and poor diet quality increase risk of early-onset advanced adenoma through increasing endotoxemia
and inflammation, and contribute to the rise of early-onset CRC. To test these hypotheses, we will leverage
lifestyle data collected throughout life course in two well-characterized prospective cohort (Nurses’ Health Study
II [NHSII]) and Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) with archived pre-diagnostic blood, complemented
by decision modeling using the Microsimulation Screening Analysis‐Colon (MISCAN‐Colon), the model used to
inform the ACS screening guideline. Specifically, we will first examine prospectively the associations between
mid-adulthood and early-life obesity, sedentary behaviors, and diet quality and risk of early-onset advanced
adenoma (Aim 1). We will then investigate into the independent and mediating role of pre-diagnostic plasma
markers of endotoxemia and inflammation in early-onset neoplasia, leveraging a cost-efficient and reliable
proteomic platform. Such profiling will also allow for untargeted discoveries of protein-protein interactions to
identify novel networks/targets (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a meta-analysis to identify early-onset CRC
specific risk factors and quantify the relative risks, and integrate these findings to the MISCAN-Colon to estimate
the contributions of secular changes of lifestyle to the rise of early-onset CRC and to improve the simulations
used to support the 2018 ACS screening guideline using early-onset CRC specific risk factors/estimates (Aim
3). Our established team, led by an early stage investigator focused on early-onset CRC, and leaders in
epidemiology, bioinformatics, biomarker measurement and discoveries, and decision modeling, offers
unparalleled expertise. This investigation will illuminate significant insights into the etiology of early-onset CRC
and will be a significant step forward to optimal/personalized CRC screening among younger adults."

approaches can be realized. The primary goal of this proposal is to produce full-length wild type BRCA1,
PALB2, and BRCA2 (along with additional protein partners BARD1, DSS1 and RAD51) to determine the
structure of stabilized heterocomplexes. Our hypothesis is that the past difficulty in solving the structure of
these core proteins is due to the presence of intrinsically disordered domains that fail to adopt a stable
conformation unless part of a larger heterocomplex. The rationale and innovation underlying the proposed
work is that cell-free expression allows small scale, versatile and rapid optimization of conditions to increase the
chances of synthesizing a full-length protein with similar solubility, biochemical and other characteristics as the
native protein. Additionally, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) can interrogate proteins that adopt
multiple conformations or contain flexible or intrinsically disordered regions as BRCA1, PALB2 and BRCA2 are
known to possess. Two specific aims will be pursued to complete this work: 1) Express, purify, and characterize
BRCA1, PALB2, and BRCA2 complexes. 2) Determine structure of BRCA1, PALB2, and BRCA2 complexes using
single particle cryo-EM. The success of the project will hinge on recent advancements in cryo-EM and our cell-
free expression pipeline. The proposed research is significant since it will provide a flexible framework for
production and structural characterization of BRCA1, PALB2, and BRCA2 complexes. These aims directly
align with the funding opportunity NIH PAR-23-058 “NCI Small Grants Program for Cancer Research for Years
2023, 2024, and 2025” as our goal is to generate an improved understanding of multiple tumor suppressor
proteins. This basic research proposal is both a feasibility study, as well as a small self-contained research project
that can be completed in two years. More in-depth molecular phenotyping, and functional and mechanistic
insights into BRCA-related DNA repair processes are beyond the scope of the current proposal due to both
timeframe and budget. That work in combination with more detailed structural comparison of more disease
related variants would be the focus of a separate follow-on proposal. The expected outcome of this work is
the synthesis of wild type BRCA1, PALB2, and BRCA2 along with structural characterization of the BRCA1-
PALB2-BRCA2 axis. It will also lay the foundation for a workflow extending our cell-free expression pipeline
from bioenergy research into the biomedical field to permit its application toward other cancer related proteins
whose structure remain elusive."

Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful approach to dissect tumors and
their ecosystems by determining the state of individual cells and inferring partial genetic information
from expressed transcripts. For infiltrating T cells, this provides a comprehensive approach to define T
cell states in human tumors. For malignant cells, scRNA-seq paves the way to characterizing cellular
states and their associated genotypes at cellular resolution. The Molecular Immunology Core (Core 1)
provides standardized and reproducible methods to profile and characterize immune cells and
malignant cells by scRNA-seq in glioblastoma in both patients and mouse models. Core 1 also
provides expert personnel, facilitates the sharing of knowledge within the program, and maintain the
sophisticated equipment necessary to generate data for all Projects. The Molecular Immunology Core
will be led Dr. Mario Suvà and Dr. Kai Wucherpfennig who will contribute their expertise in single-cell
technologies and immune cell isolation."

Myeloid Leukemia associated with Down syndrome (ML-DS) patients have high 5-year overall survival (OS) rates
when treated exclusively with cytarabine (AraC)-based protocols. While many notable factors linked to the high
curability of ML-DS have been made, the molecular mechanisms are not entirely understood. The bone marrow
microenvironment plays a role in overall leukemogenesis. We have demonstrated endothelial cells (ECs)
modulate non-DS AML growth and chemoresistance. However, their impact on the chemosensitivity of ML-DS
cells has yet to be fully understood. We have demonstrated that AML-induced EC activation in the bone marrow
leads to subsequent leukemia cell adherence and chemoresistance, identifying this process as integral in the
formation of minimal residual disease (MRD) and subsequent relapse. Interestingly, our pilot data show
significantly decreased interactions between ML-DS cells with non-DS ECs compared to non-DS AML.
Furthermore, it is well documented that ECs isolated from different tissues as well as disease states (normal vs
leukemia) represent heterogeneous populations with varied functional capacities. Based on these overall
findings, we hypothesize that ML-DS is affected by interactions with ECs and the specific activity of ML-DS ECs
play a role in increased response to chemotherapy and reduced relapse rates observed with ML-DS patients.
Understanding this mechanism will provide a deeper understanding of ML-DS. Although ML-DS patients respond
favorably to AraC-base chemotherapy, those that relapse have dismal outcomes despite salvage therapies.
Thus, enhancing the already effective frontline treatments for ML-DS patients may further improve the EFS rates
(already at ~90%) via reducing the risk of relapse. Hydroxyurea (HU) is an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase
(RNR). RNR influences the abundance of the active AraC triphosphate metabolite AraCTP. Additionally, it was
recently reported that RNR inhibitors suppress sterile α-motif and histidine-aspartate domain-containing protein
1 (SAMHD1; a deoxynucleotide triphosphohydrolase), preventing SAMHD1 from hydrolyzing/inactivating
AraCTP, resulting in enhanced AraC activity against non-DS AML. Our preliminary studies show that AraC-
resistant ML-DS cell line CMY has substantially increased SAMHD1 compared to AraC-sensitive ML-DS cell line
CMK. Based on the literature and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that HU enhances AraC antileukemic
activity against ML-DS. Our proposed studies will 1) determine the role of the DS bone marrow microenvironment
in ML-DS therapy responses and 2) use HU as an approach to enhance AraC activity against ML-DS cells.
Studying the relationship between DS ECs and ML-DS and AraC sensitivity will improve our understanding of
the mechanisms underlying the extremely high cure rates of children with ML-DS. Additionally, the development
of new AraC enhancing treatments for ML-DS patients may further improve OS rates of children with ML-DS."
10881874,"The Addressing Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias Disparities: The American Indigenous Cognitive
Assessment (AMICA) Project tackles the significant dementia disparity that exists for Indigenous populations by
determining the scalability of recently developed, culturally tailored, brief cognitive tests for dementia for use in
diverse American Indian (AI) populations. Compared to the majority population, Indigenous rates of Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias (ADRD) are approximately 3 times higher. This research will adapt and validate
a battery of complementary Indigenous cognitive assessment tools developed in Canada and Australia for use
among AI populations in the United States. This battery expands and adapts the Canadian Indigenous Cognitive
Assessment (CICA), as well as the Australian Kimberley Indigenous assessments for depression (KICA
depression), Activities of Daily Living (KICA-ADL) and a caregiver report (KICA-Carer).
Culture and context are central to Indigenous peoples’ experience with dementia and dementia diagnosis. Due
to significant cultural differences between tribal populations in Australia, Canada, and the US, existing
Indigenous culturally valid clinical tools cannot be used in the US until they are first adapted and re-validated.
Until unbiased tools are developed, we run the risk of basing critical clinical and policy decisions on flawed
epidemiological estimates of ADRD which, in turn, further exacerbates dementia inequities. Using community-
based participatory research approaches blended with Indigenous methodologies, we will revise existing
Indigenous assessments to align with AI cultural context as well as the neuropsychiatric properties. We intend
to measure and assess the reliability, validity, and cultural acceptance of the adapted instruments with a total of
390 dyads of people with dementia and their caregivers (n=780) in in two culturally distinct tribal communities in
Minnesota, Wisconsin, and an urban AI population in New Mexico. Our central hypothesis is that developing a
culturally safe cognitive assessment approach that accounts for cultural context will provide accurate diagnoses,
which in turn will help us achieve our long-term goal of improving the diagnosis and care of Indigenous persons
with dementia across the ADRD continuum. Our specific aims are to: 1) create American Indian appropriate
versions of the CICA Cog, KICA Carer, KICA depression and KICA-ADL (the “AMICA battery”); 2) assess the
psychometric properties and cultural acceptability of the four tools in the AMICA battery. We hypothesize that
the AMICA battery will demonstrate strong reliability, validity, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative
predictive value relative to the two-eyed seeing consensus diagnosis. Thus the AMICA battery will produce the
same diagnoses, while providing greater cultural safety, than the standard assessments. By achieving these
aims we can expect to deliver the first culturally adapted valid cognitive assessment battery for American Indian
older adults. In doing so, this research will help to reduce disparities, accelerate research, and enhance access
to high quality clinical practice."
10881885,"ABSTRACT
 Musculoskeletal disorders are among the most common causes of acute and chronic pain. Extensive use
of opioids for these conditions has made a substantial contribution to the current opioid epidemic. There is an
urgent need to develop potent analgesics that are as effective as opioids but avoids the side effects, including
the risk of dependency and addiction. To address this challenge, we have developed a macromolecular prodrug
(P-HMP) of hydromorphone (HMP) based on N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymers. When
HMP content increased to ³ 16 wt%, the aqueous solution of P-HMP becomes thermoresponsive and transitions
from a liquid at 4°C to a hydrogel at ³ 30°C. The hydrogel, which was designate as ProGel-HMP, allows the
sustained retention of the opioid prodrug at sites of pathology. When tested in the destabilization of the medial
meniscus (DMM) model of osteoarthritis (OA), ProGel-HMP provided potent and sustained (³ 16 days) pain relief
without spinal cord analgesia. Once locally administration, P-HMP slowly dissolves from ProGel-HMP and is
processed subcellularly by phagocytic cells to release HMP for sustained local pain relief. The P-HMP that is
not sequestered by cells drains into the circulation and rapidly clears via the kidney, effectively limiting systemic
exposure. Importantly, the absence of spinal cord analgesia, indicates that the thermoresponsive P-HMP does
not permeate the blood-brain or spinal cord barriers, which circumvents the risks of eliciting centrally mediated
drug-dependency and addiction associated with conventional opioids. Based on these preliminary findings, we
hypothesize that (1) that ProGel-HMP can provide sustained and effective local post-operative analgesia and
pain amelioration at sites of musculoskeletal trauma, independent of CNS-mediated effects; (2) that the
formulation parameters of ProGel-HMP can be modified to regulate the duration and efficacy of local analgesia
to meet the specific needs for pain management in different musculoskeletal conditions. To test these
hypotheses, we propose to first establish the dimensions within which the ProGel-HMP formulation parameters
can be adjusted to regulate the duration and efficacy of local analgesia (Aim 1). Three pain-causing conditions
will then be simulated in mice to allow in vivo assessment of ProGel-HMP. The DMM mice will be used to identify
optimal ProGel-HMP formulations for both short-term amelioration of post-operative pain and sustained
amelioration of chronic OA pain. In addition to testing efficacy and safety, pharmacokinetics/biodistribution
(PK/BD) and functional physiological studies will be performed to dissect ProGel-HMP’s mechanism of action
(Aim 2). The final studies will employ a murine closed fracture model to screen for an optimal ProGel-HMP
formulation that provides medium-term pain relief in skeletal trauma through the stages of tissue inflammation
and early skeletal repair. Efficacy, safety and mechanistic studies that are similar to those in Aim 2 will be
performed (Aim 3). At the successful completion of this proposal, we will amass robust evidence supporting our
central hypotheses that will ultimately lead to the successful translation of ProGel-HMP into clinical practice."

Suicide is a leading cause of death for Black youth with rates of suicide ideation and behaviors (SIB) increasing
at alarming rates. Unfortunately, systemic, community, organizational, provider, family, and individual level
problems/barriers increase Black youth SIB risk and also block access to needed resources/services. Current
suicide prevention/intervention efforts are not sufficient to decrease SIB in Black youth and Black LGBTQ+SGL
youth. Linking Individuals Needing Care (LINC) is a consumer- and theory-driven care coordination intervention
designed to reduce SIB by improving service engagement and delivery standards. Culturally Adapted LINC (CA-
LINC) is a proposed adaptation of LINC to meet the specific needs of diverse Black youth/families, by
incorporating input from Black communities whose help-seeking behaviors are often facilitated through non-
behavioral health supports such as Black faith-based organizations (FBO). In fact, CA-LINC will be implemented
in mental health “hubs” located in Black FBOs to facilitate access to care. In the proposed mixed-methods
feasibility study, the CA-LINC intervention will be created and then pilot-tested relative to improving risk
detection, service referrals, treatment, continuity of care, and service engagement among 80 Black youth and
Black LGBTQ+SGL ages 14-17 in Charlotte, North Carolina. Phase I of this study will use community-based
participatory research strategies to adapt LINC to address the practical, systemic, linguistic, cultural, and
developmental needs of diverse Black youth/families. We will identify/assess stakeholder perceptions/needs to
enhance suicide risk detection, service referrals/linkages, and service engagement using qualitative interviews
(Aim 1a). Focus groups will obtain provider perceptions/feedback on clinical workflow processes and
implementation strategies (Aim 1b). We will adapt service delivery components and workflow/implementation
strategies using an iterative process (Aim 1c). In Phase II, a two-arm parallel-comparison single-blinded pilot
randomized controlled trial (RCT) will explore the “fit” (i.e., feasibility) of CA-LINC in Black communities, and
inform a scalable RCT for a future R01 study (Aim 2). We will assess stakeholder perceptions on
acceptability/appropriateness of CA-LINC (Aim 2a). We will assess provider and community stakeholder
perceptions on the practicality and integration of implementing and sustaining CA-LINC using existing community
resources/infrastructure (Aim 2b). We will evaluate the feasibility of study procedures for screening, recruitment,
and randomization (Aim 2c) and evaluate treatment adherence, fidelity, and study retention (Aim 2d). We will
examine effect size estimates for SIB among Black youth randomly assigned (CA-LINC vs. Treatment as Usual,
TAU, no follow-up care) to mental health hubs (Aim 2e). Lastly, we will examine differences in potential change
mechanisms (therapeutic alliance, service utilization, cultural humility, family relationships, engagement, and
barriers to participation) between CA-LINC and TAU (Aim 2f). This study has the potential for improving service
delivery standards, reducing suicide risk among Black youth, and supporting NIMH’s goal to reduce suicide rates."

Center’s research mission, achieve its scientific goals in alignment with the Strategic Plan, and support novel,
transdisciplinary research aimed at reducing the cancer burden in UACC’s five-county Catchment Area. UACC
has implemented a rigorous process for allocation of Developmental Funds to ensure scientific impact and
substantial return on investment (ROI). During the project period, UACC awarded $1.7M in CCSG
Developmental Funds that resulted in $3.6M in cancer-related funding, plus 35 peer-reviewed publications, for
a two-fold ROI. Additional UACC investments of $2M in support of strategic initiatives, such as imaging
research and investigator-initiated clinical trials, yielded subsequent funding of $8M and 24 peer-reviewed
publications. Thus UACC’s $3.7M investment in 75 pilot projects and other support resulted in additional
funding of $11.6M during the project period for an overall three-fold ROI. In the future project period, UACC
requests Developmental Funds to support high risk-high reward pilot projects aligned with the scientific
priorities outlined in the Center’s 2020–2025 Strategic Plan. These include Cancer and the Environment, Novel
Therapeutics and Preventive Interventions, and Cancer Imaging and Bioengineering. It is envisioned that these

10900080,"Project Summary
Corneal transplants are typically successful in low-risk allograft recipients. However, a vascularized or inflamed
host bed is considered high-risk and results in significant increases in graft rejection rates. In addition to
vascularization and inflammation, unsuccessful corneal transplants can become fibrotic due to deficiencies in
limbal stem cells (LSC) and stromal myofibroblast activation. Because of such deficits in the healing process, it
is essential to boost the regenerative capacity of the cornea and limbus in the host bed environment. Ideally,
increasing corneal transplantation success will involve mitigating the inflammatory and vascularization response,
as well as promoting the LSC regenerative capacity during the healing process. MG53 is a member of the TRIM
protein family with multi-cellular functions in tissue-repair and regeneration. While predominantly expressed in
muscle cells, native MG53 protein is present in the tear film and aqueous humor, and contributes to maintenance
of corneal integrity and preservation of LSC health. Mice with ablation of MG53 are susceptible to corneal injury
and develop symptoms of LSC deficiency. Conversely, mice with elevated levels of MG53 in circulation and in
ocular tissues are resistant to corneal injury and vascularization. In addition to facilitating tissue repair, MG53
has anti-inflammatory functions associated with chronic injury or infection, and can also modulate TGF-β
signaling in corneal stromal fibroblasts. These additional functions of MG53 may contribute to improved tissue
remodeling following corneal transplantation. We have obtained preliminary data to show that topical
administration of recombinant human MG53 (rhMG53) protein in mice has benefits in facilitating the initial phase
of corneal healing, improving the regenerative capacity of the corneal graft, and mitigating vascularization post-
corneal transplantation. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the multi-cellular function of MG53 will
have significant benefits on corneal transplantation outcomes. The studies designed in this project are focused
on addressing the following fundamental questions: How does muscle-derived MG53 act as a myokine to
improve the healing process and regenerative capacity of corneal transplants? What are the risk-benefits of
using rhMG53 as a therapeutic agent to enhance the outcomes of corneal transplantation? Can the combination
of rhMG53 and an immunosuppressant provide additive benefits to reduce corneal graft failure?"
10904006,"My long-term goal is to understand how neural circuits underlying specific brain functions are formed, modified
by experience, and altered in neurological conditions. The goal of this proposal is to examine mechanisms that
regulate formation of the long-range neuronal connections between the superior colliculus (SC) and specific
subcortical brain areas. We chose to focus on the connections between superficial layer of SC (sSC) and the
thalamus. The SC is a midbrain center that plays an important role in sensory and motor processing. The sSC
receives visual inputs from the retina and cortex, and sSC-thalamic connections are known to mediate
defensive responses to threating visual stimuli. As most of traditional studies have investigated organization of
sensory inputs to sSC, little is known about mechanisms regulating development of sSC output pathways.
Moreover, no study has described developmental regulation of sSC-thalamic circuits underlying visually-driven
behavioral responses. In a screen for the markers labeling subsets of sSC neurons, we have identified several
genes that are likely to control development of sSC neurons. Now, we propose to investigate the role of those
molecules in sSC output circuit assembly. We have already demonstrated that a transcriptional factor, retinoid-related orphan receptor β (Rorβ), regulates sSC neuronal projections to specific thalamic nuclei. Here, we plan
to examine downstream mechanisms of Rorβ-dependent regulation by gain- and loss-of-function approaches.
We will also investigate the role of another transcription factor, Brn3b, in the development of distinct sSC
circuits and identify the downstream effectors of Brn3b. Given that sSC neurons, confined to specific
sublayers, selectively project axons to distinct thalamic nuclei, and that Brn3b and Rorβ are expressed in
different sublayers of sSC, we hypothesize that Brn3b regulates axonal projections via Rorβ-independent
mechanisms. Manipulations of Rorβ and Brn3b expression produce different patterns of altered axonal
projections to the thalamic nucleus, known to govern visual-cue triggered behaviors. Based on these findings,
we will test if Rorβ- and Brn3b-dependent mechanisms of circuit assembly are required for appropriate
behavioral responses to visual threat. The success of the proposed project will improve our understanding of
the molecular basis for establishing the long-range connections between sSC and thalamic areas. It will also
provide novel mechanistic insights into developmental assmebly of subcortical visual circuits regulating
responses to the threatening stimuli."
10904009,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Congenitally blind children with co-morbid hearing loss (DeafBlind children) often
experience severe language delays due to their multisensory losses. These delays often lead to
misidentification of these children as Developmentally Delayed and subsequently negatively impact
intervention, rehabilitation, and educational efforts. Providing early, accessible language may address this
issue by scaffolding early cognitive development. However, current rehabilitation approaches have extremely
limited success. Existing interventions rely on establishing associations between an object the child touches
(e.g., shoes), and a specific functional activity (e.g., going outside). This approach lacks the linguistic
structures needed for early cognitive development. Only in later childhood do interventions begin to use visual
sign language and/or spoken language. This approach poses two major problems: First, neither of these
languages is fully accessible for DeafBlind children. Second, by the time language is introduced, many children
are past the age at which language can be effectively acquired (i.e., the critical period for language).
Consequently, only a small number of DeafBlind children acquire effective communication and achieve age-
appropriate cognitive, and daily life milestones. Until recently, no fully accessible language for DeafBlind
children existed. Protactile is a fully tactile language that has recently developed among DeafBlind adults. This
research endeavor focuses on measuring how well protactile can serve as an early language for DeafBlind
children. Adult Protactile Experts who are DeafBlind will play with DeafBlind children using protactile multiple
times per week in a longitudinal study. We will use number language to index the efficacy of the intervention.
Number language serves as an excellent index because it provides a targeted set of vocabulary items to
measure, is directly linked to cognitive development, and has non-linguistic perception-based abilities that have
been found in typically developing infants. The specific aims of this study are: (1) Intervention: Identify which
tactile number expressions produced by DeafBlind adults are learned by DeafBlind children, (2) Prototype
Development: Develop a haptic device to be worn by DeafBlind children that delivers taps and squeezes and
also measures heart rate patterns, and (3) Non-linguistic Assessment: Using the wearable device and heart
rate patterns, we will demonstrate whether DeafBlind children perceive differences between different numbers
of taps or squeezes produced by the device. We expect that DeafBlind children will express protactile number
language, and that our haptic measure will reveal non-linguistic abilities similar to typically developing children.
This project will generate evidence regarding the use of protactile in early intervention, supporting the
achievement of early developmental milestones in DeafBlind children and contributing to their long-term quality
of life. Further, successful completion will contribute to the development of nonlinguistic measures of cognition
in DeafBlind children and other children with whom visual measures are not suitable."
10904010,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Influenza A virus (IAV) triggers the death of most cell types in which it replicates, both in culture and in vivo. In
2016, we described an IAV-activated cell death pathway which accounts for almost all IAV-activated death in
infected pulmonary cells. Over that past funding cycle, we showed that this pathway is initiated when the host
sensor protein ZBP1 detects viral Z-RNAs and activates RIPK3 kinase. RIPK3 then triggers parallel, redundant
pathways of programmed necrosis (necroptosis) and apoptosis. These studies have outlined the dominant cell
death pathway activated by IAV in infected lungs. They have also demonstrated that ZBP1 is an RNA sensing
protein, and that the RNA structures it recognizes are Z-RNAs, which are unique, left-handed double-helical
RNA species that had not previously been thought to occur in nature. We have now made several intriguing
new discoveries that set the stage for this application. First, we found that the Z-RNAs produced during IAV
infections are not just viral in origin, but host cell-derived as well. Second, we observed that in alveolar
macrophages (AMs), unlike in all other lung cell types tested, ZBP1 activation does not result in cell death, but
instead in a non-cytolytic transcriptional program essential for protection against IAV lethality. Third, we found
that necroptosis during IAV infections is activated not in the cytoplasm, but in the nucleus, resulting in nuclear
rupture. Such `nuclear necroptosis' is highly inflammatory, and is a major driver of the pathogenesis during
severe influenza. Finally, we have obtained important new insight into the coevolution of IAV with the
necroptosis machinery in birds and bats, the two major natural hosts of these viruses. While birds simply do not
express ZBP1, we have found that bats possess a single amino acid alteration in RIPK3 which selectively
abrogates necroptosis (but not apoptosis) signaling, potentially explaining how these organisms tolerate such
a large diversity of IAV subtypes. To our knowledge, these discoveries provide the first evidence that
endogenous Z-RNAs may function as innate ligands for ZBP1 in anti-IAV immunity, that ZBP1 has non-cytolytic
functions during IAV infections, and that a IAV activates a unique, hyper-inflammatory form of necroptosis from
the nucleus. They also provide fresh evolutionary insight into how IAV strains are tolerated in their natural
reservoirs, but can activate pathogenic necroptosis in humans. Based these and other observations, the goals
of this proposal are to (1) to identify and characterize endogenous Z-RNA ligands for ZBP1, and to determine
their importance to ZBP1 activated cell death in IAV-infected cells; (2) to delineate the mechanism and function
of non-cytolytic ZBP1 signaling in AMs; and (3) to understand the role of nuclear necroptosis in influenza
pathogenesis and in evolution. These studies unite two labs with expertise in ZBP1 signaling (Balachandran)
and IAV pathogenesis (Thomas), and their successful completion stands to provide pioneering insight into the
mechanism and function of ZBP1-initiated cell death during IAV infections, with important clinical and
evolutionary ramifications."

experience required to become an independent clinician scientist and a leader in neonatal lung disease
research. She has received a Master’s degree in Translational Research from University of Pennsylvania.
Candidate’s long-term career goal is to develop novel therapies to promote lung repair and regeneration for
treatment of neonatal lung diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). To achieve these goals, she
will be mentored by a team of internationally recognized experts in pulmonary basic science research from
Nemours and University of Pennsylvania with whom she has a proven track record of successful mentorship
and productivity. She will undergo a rigorous didactics and hands-on training program to acquire expertise in
elucidating pulmonary cell-specific molecular mechanisms within the lung microenvironment using complex
genetic mouse models and 3D co-culture systems; application of gene editing technologies as a mechanistic
and therapeutic tool to modulate candidate genes in complex lung diseases such as BPD; and expertise in
advanced bioinformatics. Her research will focus on (1) elucidating the function of Cellular communication
network factor 2 (Ccn2) in alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) during alveologenesis and (2) evaluating whether
modulating Ccn2 expression in AEC will improve a hyperoxia-induced BPD phenotype. This research proposal
is built upon candidate’s preliminary research that demonstrates an important causative role for Ccn2 in severe
BPD and the therapeutic potential of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology to manipulate disease causing
genes expressed in the developing pulmonary epithelium. BPD is the most common cause of death, severe
neurodevelopmental impairment, and hospital readmissions in preterm infants. In spite of advances in clinical
care, clinical efforts to prevent and treat BPD have been largely unsuccessful. As the cell type most exposed to
the external environment, AEC have emerged as a central focus in many lung diseases, including BPD.
Moreover, AEC can be directly targeted by therapeutic agents delivered through intra-amniotic, intra-nasal and
intra-tracheal routes. Thus, a better understanding of mechanisms in AEC that drive alveologenesis during
normal lung development and in response to early postnatal lung injury, would pave path for targeted therapies
for severe BPD. By precisely examining the spatial and temporal function of Ccn2 in AEC during
alveologenesis and early postnatal lung injury induced by hyperoxia, this study will provide novel mechanistic
insights into its role in regulating alveologenesis and lead to novel therapies targeted at AEC-derived Ccn2 for
the prevention and treatment of severe BPD. Candidate has access to all required technical, laboratory and
intellectual resources in an ideal collaborative environment for successfully conducting her research and pave
the path to develop as an independent investigator."
10903838,"Project Summary / Abstract
 The widespread use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has significantly increased the lifespan of
people living with HIV (PLWH). As HIV has become a chronic disease, there is a growing concern of the
disproportionate risk of a variety of comorbidities. Two such comorbidities that occur at a higher prevalence in
cART treated PLWH include bone loss and fat gain. Interestingly, as new treatment recommendations have
shifted to cART regimens that are less bone toxic, there appears to be an increased prevalence of excessive
fat gain and an increased risk for the development of metabolic syndrome. Our long-term goal is to determine
the mechanisms contributing to these comorbid conditions in cART treated PLWH in order to find less
deleterious treatment options. The current proposal will test the central hypothesis that the hormonal
communication between bone and fat explains how antiretrovirals (ARVs) contribute to bone loss and fat gain
in PLWH. Our hypothesis is based on our preliminary data showing hormonal changes in response to ARVs
and correlations between the changes in bone and fat hormones and BMD loss and fat gain with cART
initiation. To test our hypothesis, we propose to take a hierarchical approach that will include in vitro,
preclinical, and human subject studies. In Aim 1, we will define the contribution of individual ARVs and cART to
bone and fat cellular function and hormonal production using primary human cells. In Aim 2, we will investigate
the skeletal and metabolic response to individual ARVs and cART using both an uninfected wild-type mouse
and a humanized mouse model of HIV-infection. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the association between
bone and fat-derived hormones and bone mass and body composition in three critical treatment stages, cART
initiation, long-term stable cART treatment, and switching cART regimens. If successful, this proposal,
submitted by an early stage investigator (ESI), will provide significant insights into key comorbidities faced by
HIV patients on cART—specifically by illuminating how individual ARVs negatively affect bone/fat cell function
and hormonal production. At the same time, this proposal will increase our general understanding of the bone-
fat hormonal axis."

Preventing HIV transmission with enhanced Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) access, particularly among
marginalized populations with disproportionate HIV incidence (e.g., minoritized racial/ethnic and sexual
orientation and gender groups), is a crucial step in ending the HIV epidemic. Though unhealthy alcohol use is a
central modifiable risk factor for HIV incidence and over-represented among marginalized populations, few HIV
prevention interventions exist that synergistically address both unhealthy alcohol use and PrEP. Research is
needed to understand PrEP uptake among individuals with unhealthy alcohol use and to develop scalable
patient-centered interventions that synergistically address unhealthy alcohol use and HIV. The Veterans Health
administration (VA) is a leader in provision of evidence-based care for unhealthy alcohol use, yet substantial
gaps in PrEP implementation for Veterans with unhealthy alcohol use exist—our preliminary research suggests
major gaps in PrEP knowledge, use, and reach, and Veterans with unhealthy alcohol use. Evidence-based
interventions/treatments are available for unhealthy alcohol use, but alcohol use is historically under targeted in
HIV prevention interventions. Our team of interdisciplinary experts in HIV and addiction medicine, the intersection
of alcohol use and HIV, implementation science, health disparities research, and community-partnered research
will use sequential mixed methods guided by socioecological theory, the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Science, and the Discover/Design/Build/Test (DDBT) process to understand the impact of
unhealthy alcohol use on the PrEP care continuum and then refine an existing decision aid to increase PrEP
initiation in primary care at the point of alcohol-related care in the VA. Quantitative work will include ~1.9 million
individuals, including adequate numbers of minoritized patients (e.g., ~115,000 individuals with minoritized
sexual orientation and ~11,000 individuals with minoritized gender identity) and will assess variation in patterns
of PrEP initiation and persistence across VA facilities and patient subgroups (Aim 1). Findings will be used to
inform purposive sampling for qualitative work to refine (Aim 2) and then pilot test an existing decision aid for
developed previously with NIAAA support (Aim 3). Our study is patient-centered and innovative in characterizing
PrEP care overall and within diverse subgroups of patients with and without unhealthy alcohol use, leveraging a
novel natural language processing (NLP)--driven algorithm for identifying sexual minority groups, and tailoring
an existing decision aid to facilitate shared decision-making for co-occurring HIV prevention and alcohol use.
Study activities will be conducted with iterative input from a community advisory board. The study is highly
responsive to NIAAA priorities and has potential for high impact as it will lay foundation for integrating a patient-
centered and multi-targeted novel decision aid for HIV prevention in routine primary care settings that may have
potential to increase equity in care."
10872731,"Tendinopathies are common injuries that typically result from accumulation of sub-rupture fatigue damage. We
have developed an in vivo model of sub-rupture fatigue damage accumulation using the rat patellar tendon to
investigate the onset and pathogenesis of tendinopathy. We found that just one bout of fatigue loading results in
collagen matrix damage and a 20% stiffness loss that is not recovered out to at least 10-weeks. We also found
that running exercise leads to repair when initiated 2-weeks after onset of sub-rupture fatigue injury but promotes
further degeneration when initiated 1-day after onset of injury, uniquely positioning us to determine the underlying
mechanisms necessary to develop therapeutics to transform everyday activity into a reparative stimulus. We
identified glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), specifically hyaluronan (HA) and dermatan sulfate (DS), to be increased
prior to initiation of therapeutic but not degenerative exercise. Postmortem depletion of GAGs showed that their
increase after sub-rupture fatigue injury reduces matrix shear strain and increases dynamic modulus which are
properties that are associated with modulation of proliferation, apoptosis, and αSMA differentiation. Investigation
of the repair response from therapeutic exercise identified an increase in population of αSMA+ cells and integrin
α5 (α5+/tenocytes and α5+/αSMA+ cells); an integrin that enhances the capacity of cells to withstand loads
thereby preventing cell death. Our inhibition of αSMA+ cells in therapeutic exercise increased the area of high
severity matrix damage. Blocking integrin α5 altered the morphology of αSMA and tenocytes and decreased
damage area, further enhancing the therapeutic effect of exercise. We will test the hypothesis that (1) the
increase in GAGs after onset of fatigue injury modulates the stressful mechanical environment of cells in
damaged tendons resulting from subsequent loading, leading to an increase in population of αSMA+ cells and
integrin α5 (Aim 1); (2) the increase in αSMA+ cells will largely decrease the area of high matrix damage and
that αSMA+ cells mediate tissue repair (Aim 2); and (3) that integrin α5 protects cells form apoptosis in response
to higher loading but promotes a catabolic response from the surviving α5+/tenocytes while enhancing the
functionality of α5+/αSMA+ cells (Aim 3). We will deplete HA and DS in vivo prior to initiation of therapeutic
exercise to determine their role in transforming loading into a reparative stimulus (Aim 1). Pharmaceuticals will
be used to inhibit the population αSMA+ cells (using Simvastatin in Aim 2) and to block integrin α5 (using ATN-
161 in Aim 3) to interrogate their role in promoting repair of fatigue damaged tendons. scRNAseq will be used to
compare the cell populations that are associated with repair versus degeneration of fatigue damaged tendons
and determine the effect of inhibition of αSMA+ cells and blocking of integrin α5 on these cell populations. The
proposed studies will inform diagnostics to guide management of tendon injuries by identifying the biological
environment that is associated with subsequent repair from continued use; and will inform therapeutics by
determining key biological drivers of repair that can potentially be employed independently of exercise."
10872685,"Ras is the most mutated oncoprotein. FDA-approved inhibitors target a small subset of Ras
mutants and two of the three oncogenic Ras signaling effectors, Raf>MEK>ERK and
PI3K>PDK>AKT. Yet resistance to inhibitors remains a major challenge. The consequences of
oncogenic Ras signaling via its third effector, RalGEF activation of the small GTPase Ral, are
much less well understood. The inhibitory RalGAP selective for Ral is a tumor suppressor and
Ral is a proto-oncoprotein. Elevated activation of Ral is most prominently observed in pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the tumor type with the highest Ras mutation rate and poor
survival. Molecular details of Ral signaling have confounded interpretation of its putative role in
cancer: Ral is an essential regulator of the exocyst complex and hence exocytosis but is also
thought to use the exocyst as a signaling intermediary to promote oncogenesis. This dual function
of Ral presents a fundamental knowledge gap that has impeded understanding of the role of
the Ras>RalGEF>Ral signal in cancer: all genetic perturbations of Ral alter both signaling and
exocytosis. We have filled this gap using C. elegans as model to study Ral signaling and exocyst
function. We successfully identified a separation-of-function missense mutation that
disrupts Ral signaling but not exocytosis. We hypothesize that introducing this mutation into
human RALA or RALB proteins will lock them into inactive form and abrogate KRAS signaling in
KRAS-positive PDAC cell lines while, critically, retaining exocyst functionality. Aim 1 will
determine the molecular mechanism underlying missense separation of Ral functions. Structures
of human Ral proteins suggest our missense mutation weakens a salt bridge required for proper
guanine nucleotide binding. We will analyze the GDP/GTP cycle of wild type vs. mutant human
RALA/B in vitro and with real-time NMR with PDAC cells. We will also mutate the partner residue
of the salt bridge to phenocopy the original mutation in C. elegans. Aim 2 will translate our findings
from C. elegans into preclinical studies using a panel of KRAS-mutant PDAC cell lines with
elevated RALA/B activity. We will complement disruption of the endogenous RALA and RALB
with wild-type vs. separation-of-function mutant RALA and RALB. We will test KRAS-driven traits
of PDAC cells known to be dependent on RalGEF>Ral: proliferation, survival, anchorage-
independent growth, and invasion will be the key endpoints examined. We have unlocked
investigation of the third oncogenic effector of Ras, RalGEF>Ral. Substantiation of our
hypothesis is expected to translate a breakthrough genetic mutation into human cancer cells."
10872748,"Bereaved friend and family caregivers have taken on the burden of end-of-life care for patients with cancer
who die in hospice care at home. Bereavement can be emotionally devastating, especially to those who have
put aside their own needs to support the dying individual. Supporting bereaved CGs’ emotional health and
general well-being is a critical need. The proposed pilot study will evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of a
6-week low-tech nature meditation intervention aimed at supporting bereaved caregivers’ who are in the first 6
months since the patients’ death. The intervention, based on the mutually supportive role that meditation
practices and nature have been shown to promote wellbeing, will be developed capitalizing on the strengths of
the research team’s early intervention work involving patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers. For
this single group longitudinal study, Aim 1 will focus on the development of 6 nature-based healing meditation
(NBHM) auditory modules available via the study website to facilitate bereavement (grief) recovery and
assessed on parameters of directed attention, grief, and QOL (including parameters of depression/anxiety).
The 2nd aim will then evaluate acceptability and feasibility of the 6-week program of both content and delivery
methods (numbers eligible vs. number consented; numbers consented vs. numbers completed; number of
weeks using the intervention) for the intervention modules. We will then conduct semi-structured interviews
with a small diverse representative sample of caregivers to evaluate benefits, satisfaction, and challenges in
more depth. Fifty-five home-based cancer caregivers who recently experienced the death of their patient will
be recruited from Hospice of Michigan. Testing will occur at baseline (Time 1; study week 0), at the intervention
end (Time 2; week 6), and (Time 3; study week 12). This research targets a supportive caregiver intervention
that will be flexibly delivered on-line for use at the caregiver’s convenience. Once feasibility and acceptability
for this new intervention to support bereaved caregivers are addressed, a larger scale randomized control trial
will be sought."
10872747,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aberrations in reproductive function may be a harbinger of future health. Recent studies
demonstrate associations between infertility and future risk of cardiometabolic disease and mortality in
studies of both males and females. To date, most studies examining the association between fertility and long-
term health have been retrospective with limited data on individuals at the beginning of their fertility attempts,
making it difficult to assess causality. Further examination of the intersection of reproductive and somatic health
has implications for millions around the world. In the current proposal, we will combine two interrelated and
ongoing prospective cohorts of couples trying to conceive to examine the association between fertility and
future health. Launched in Denmark in 2007, Snart-Gravid.dk (SG; translates to `soon pregnant') is a
prospective internet-based preconception cohort of female pregnancy planners. In 2011, the study began
enrolling male partners and was renamed Snart-Foraeldre.dk (SF; translates to `soon parents'). Pregnancy
Study Online (PRESTO) is an ongoing prospective cohort study of couples residing in the U.S. or Canada.
Modeled on the SG/SF cohorts and initiated in 2013. With a combined total of more than 39,000
participants, the SG/SF (>18,000) and PRESTO (>21,000) cohorts provide the ideal data to answer
questions about the influence of fertility on future health outcomes. Comprehensive data have been
collected for both members of the couple during the preconception and perinatal periods. In this application, we
propose to extend follow-up of participants for up to 20 years and collect additional clinical data in all cohorts
(e.g., via registry linkage in Denmark; and via questionnaire re-contact and medical record validation in
PRESTO) to evaluate the following specific aims: 1) Evaluate extent to which TTP and SAB predict
cardiometabolic disorders (e.g., incident hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes), 2) Evaluate extent
to which TTP and SAB predict subsequent immune disorders. 3) Assess extent to which TTP and SAB
predict subsequent weight gain in the PRESTO cohort. An infertility evaluation creates an opportunity to
identify and intervene regarding an individual's future health risk, which could be modified by early
recognition and/or prevention of disease depending on the association. Establishing an association
between reproductive and future health could be a “game changer” if care is shifted to early prevention for
those at risk and treatment for those already affected. The current proposal will fill important gaps in the
literature on the extent to which fertility serves as a marker of future health and will create opportunities for
primary prevention of diseases in mid-life."

While the FDA and the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay initiative (CiPA) are focused primarily on
predicting proarrhythmic effects, drug attrition due to cardiomyopathy, or primary cardiac cytotoxicity, may be
even more prevalent, is typically currently only carried out via animal studies, and limits dosage for many
cancer chemotherapeutics. Due to improving cancer survival, it is increasing common for more cancer
survivors of some cancer types to die of cardiac diseases due to cancer treatment side effects than cancer
recurrence. Cardiac contractions are initiated by electrical depolarizations (action potentials, APs) that
propagate through the heart and initiate calcium (Ca2+) transients that activate the contractile apparatus.
Importantly, dysregulation of Ca2+ can trigger inappropriate early-after- and delayed-after- depolarizations
(EADs and DADs) that initiate arrhythmias, inhibit mitochondrial function, and pathologically alter expression of
contractile proteins. Chemotherapy and other drugs can also directly impair mitochondrial function, which is
primarily thought to cause cytotoxicity, but can also cause arrhythmias. Cardiomyocytes are also

by-cell basis, in human cardiomyocytes, but this is not possible with current test methods. To address this
unmet need we propose to develop a high throughput (robotic) Kinetic Image Cytometry that simultaneously

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Synapses are the fundamental information processing units in the brain and their dysfunction leads to
neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Synapse development and organization is mediated in
part by a class of transmembrane proteins called synaptic cell-adhesion molecules (sCAMs), and mutations in
sCAM genes is highly associated with diseases such as autism, schizophrenia and intellectual disability,
among others. The dominant model for synapse formation suggests that it is initiated by the trans-synaptic
binding of sCAMs, however in vivo evidence for that model is lacking. Here we propose to uncover non-trans-
synaptic cell-intrinsic molecular programs for presynaptic assembly that mediate the localization, trafficking and
subcellular functions of sCAMs and other integral presynaptic proteins.
 Our preliminary evidence suggests that the intracellular domains of the presynaptic sCAMs neurexin and
syg-2/nephrin are cell-autonomously required for presynaptic organization. Moreover, we find that the
localization of neurexin to the presynaptic active zone is mediated by intracellular interactions with active zone
scaffold proteins and kinesin motors. Finally, we have found that the dependence of sCAMs and other active
zone proteins on transport by kinesins depends on the stage of axonal outgrowth. Based on these findings, we
hypothesize that presynaptic assembly is mediated in large part by cell-intrinsic mechanisms. We propose to
pursue three Specific Aims to characterize the mechanisms that govern (1) the intracellular recruitment of
sCAMs, (2) the intracellular organization of proper synapse spacing by sCAM-mediated cytoskeletal
rearrangement, and (3) the delivery and reallocation of sCAMs and other active zone proteins by kinesin-
dependent and independent mechanisms at different stages of axonal outgrowth (Aim 3).
 To investigate these hypotheses, we leverage the genetic tractability and stereotyped nervous system of
the nematode C. elegans, along with innovative imaging and genetic approaches. C. elegans has a long
history of revealing fundamental synaptic biology and our previous published results and preliminary data
position us well to take advantage of the power of this system. Collectively our proposed research will reveal
how cell-intrinsic mechanisms govern the function of sCAMs in synapse formation. These studies have the
potential to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders that result from
defects in sCAM function, and thus provide targets for the development of specific therapeutic interventions."

10898548,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects over 300,000 troops from the Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)/Operation
Enduring Freedom (OEF). Mild TBI (mTBI) is the most prevalent brain injury from these conﬂicts and
represents 90% of all brain injuries. However, clinical presentation of mTBI overlaps with those of subjects
suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is also a prevalent condition that afﬂicts 30% of the
soldiers returning from the OIF/OEF. The pathophysiology of TBI remains difﬁcult to dissect owing to the
heterogenous nature of the injuries that occur in the military population. A number of neuropathological studies
using brain tissue from professional football players and military veterans who sustained TBI in life showed
accumulation of amyloid and tau, both of which are key pathologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent
studies show that blood Aβ and tau levels are also altered in blood of subjects with mTBI. Studies conducted
by the Roskamp Institute scientists and others showed that individuals with the apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4 allele
and a diagnosis of TBI suffered from learning and memory impairment that was consistent with AD.
Nevertheless, detecting AD related pathology in mTBI subjects remains a critical challenge and therefore
discovery of blood biomarkers will greatly enhance our ability to detect preclinical AD in subjects with mTBI.
 We have shown that omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content within blood
phospholipids (PL) are altered in ε4 carriers with preclinical mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. These
blood PL are also altered in ε4 carriers with TBI compared to controls and non-ε4 carriers. The omega-3 and
omega-6 PUFA can undergo a series of enzymatic and non-enzymatic processes which result in generation of
bioactive lipid metabolites that inﬂuence a range of inﬂammatory and oxidative stress parameters which are
relevant to both AD and TBI pathologies. Levels of sphingomyelin (SM) are altered in AD and TBI patients and
these lipids can be further metabolized to generate ceramides that are potent modulators of inﬂammation. We
therefore hypothesize that an examination of bioactive lipid metabolites (i.e. eicosanoids, isoprostanes,
resolvins, lipoxins, ceramides and sphingosine) will be useful in differentiating mTBI subjects from healthy
controls and those with conditions which present with similar symptoms. These bioactive lipid metabolites will
also help predict cognitive decline indicative of subsequent AD risk. We have developed lipidomic assays that
take advantage of the nano-ﬂow Ultra high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) systems and the high
mass accuracy and high resolution capabilities of the Q-Exactive hybrid quadruple Orbitrap mass
spectrometer, allowing us to efﬁciently and accurately identify and quantify hundreds of bioactive lipid
metabolites. We will apply this technology to identify novel blood lipid metabolites that can differentiate
subjects with mTBI from other diagnostic groups. We will determine the intra- and inter-person variations of
blood lipid metabolites to identify those with low variability which will then be evaluated longitudinally over
short- and long-term periods. From these studies, we will identify metabolites that are associated with cognitive
decline experienced by subjects with mTBI. The work proposed herein will largely use the existing samples
available in the bio-repositories that were collected from subjects enrolled in the Chronic Effects of
Neurotrauma Consortium and military cohorts. We expect that the proposed lipidomics technology, together
with the APOE genotype information, will allow us to develop a biomarker panel that will aid clinicians in
providing an accurate diagnosis of mTBI and in prognosis of cognitive impairment associated with AD after
mTBI. These studies will improve our ability to provide better care and disease management to patients with
mTBI in order to reduce their risk of developing AD and related disorders."
10899658,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Coccidioidomycosis or Valley Fever (VF), is caused by the fungus Coccidioides immitis and C.
posadasii with highest reported prevalence in Arizona and California. Due to similar clinical
presentations, VF is frequently misdiagnosed and mistreated as bacterial or viral pneumonia, resulting
in unnecessary antibiotics and longer times to resolve illness. Patients lose productivity and
experience symptoms for many months. Severe CM manifests in <5% of symptomatic cases but can
be life-threatening. T cell responses plays an important role in vaccine induced protection in animal
models. In fact, this activity appears to be critical for defense against Coccidioides in humans, as
evidenced by the fact that humans with low CD4+ T cell counts due to HIV infection are at increased
risk of severe VF. The objective of this proposal is to identify T cell clones and their associated
epitopes that are generated in human patients and animal models. For Coccidioides spp. epitopes, we
will focus on previously confirmed and novel in vivo early expressed antigens and we will link these
epitopes to their TCRs using a T cell peptide stimulation strategy. Our hypothesis is that epitopes
from these Coccidioides antigens drive patient TCR profiles and, hence, will contain “public” TCR
sequences that can be used for VF diagnosis and prioritize vaccine candidates. We predict that the
TCR profiles are indicative of immune and disease states. We will address this hypothesis by deep
TCR sequencing of activated T cells stimulated with Coccidioides peptide epitopes. We will identify
TCRs specific to these and other Coccidioides proteins in patient samples from both Arizona (C.
posadasii) and California (C. immitis). We will also confirm that mouse and macaque T cells detect
epitopes from these antigens to aid in Coccidioides challenge model development. In addition, the
immunogenic Coccidioides antigens will be evaluated for protection in these animal models after
vaccination. Finally, we will generate a TCR sequencing diagnostic test to detect VF patients.
Specifically, we aim to: 1) Characterize C. posadasii and C. immitis epitopes and associated T cell
clones (TCR) in human specimens using T cell receptor sequencing and standard cell sorting
techniques, 2) Determine TCRs and epitopes recognized during animal model (mouse and pig-tailed
macaque) challenge, natural exposure, and RNA/DNA vaccinations, and 3) Compare the sensitivity
between traditional serology and TCR sequencing using endemic and non-endemic populations. If
successful, this project will make available to the community a novel set of T cell epitopes for VF in
humans, mice, and macaques. The TCR sequences can be used to develop next generation
diagnostics and aid in antigens identification for vaccination. Finally, T cell clonotypes specific to these
epitopes will be correlated to protection through the models and disease outcomes in VF patients."
10899660,"SUMMARY
Coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley Fever (VF) impacts residents in arid regions of the world including
southwestern US, areas in South and Central America and in Mexico. Annual incidences are rising overall with
estimated increases in recent years of more than 200% in some areas. In addition, epidemiological studies
indicate that the geographical range of VF is expanding and up to 17-29% of community-acquired pneumonia in
these areas can be attributed to Coccidiodes infections. VF poses a significant and ongoing threat to human
health, but to date, there is no safe and effective vaccine licensed for VF. As such, there is an urgent unmet
need to develop a vaccine that can provide protection from the disease. Evidence suggests an effective vaccine
for VF should be possible. Individuals who recover from VF will generally have lifelong immunity against re-
exposure. Furthermore, early studies employing live attenuated vaccine strategies have demonstrated significant
protection in mouse and nonhuman primate models of infection although due to the risk of severe reactogenicity
and genetic reversion, a live attenuated vaccine for human use is not considered a viable approach. Nucleic acid
vaccines, including both DNA and RNA vaccines, result in the intracellular expression of antigens, mimicking a
live infection including induction of robust antibody and T cell responses, but without the risks associated with a
live infection. Recent advances with both DNA and mRNA vaccine technologies have moved them to the forefront
as one of the most effective vaccines strategies to induce protective immunity in humans, as evident by the
current, highly efficacious licensed COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. In addition, DNA and RNA vaccines are rapid
and simple, requiring only the genetic sequence of a given antigen to design. The ease and speed in constructing
and producing DNA and RNA vaccines makes them an ideal tool to enable rapid screening of a large number of
potential antigens to identify novel immunogens for a VF vaccine. Here, we propose to leverage advanced DNA
and RNA vaccine delivery technologies developed at the University of Washington to identify novel immunogens
for a VF vaccine and to investigate their immunogenicity and efficacy in animal models. Toward this goal, in
collaboration with Research Projects 1 and 2 and the Animal Core, we propose to identify a lead nucleic acid
vaccine platform for a VF vaccine (Aim 1), employ that technology to investigate candidate virulence factors and
putative T cell epitopes as protective immunogens to design a lead vaccine composition that affords optimum
immunogenicity, safety and efficacy in mice (Aim 2) and nonhuman primates (Aim 3). If successful, these studies
could lead to development of a novel nucleic acid vaccine that can provide protection from Valley Fever."

ABSTRACT
 Members of the faculty of Yale University have a longstanding interest in non-malignant hematological
research. This interest has further intensified in recent years, now encompassing multiple departments and a
variety of disciplines. The Cell Preparation and Analysis Core (Core A) was initially established within the
framework of Yale Cooperative Center of Excellence in Hematology (YCCEH) to address the needs and
challenges of non-malignant hematology research laboratories both at Yale and in other institutions, by providing
twelve services. Over the past four years, Core A has been successful in providing services and training, with
an average of ~50 Yale and ~10 non-Yale users annually. Core A also has effectively trained and/or serviced 97
junior researchers, and contributed to the publication of 30 papers. With the success of Core A in the past funding
cycle, we have also become increasingly aware of additional needs in non-malignant hematology research. We
thus propose to continue the success of existing service offerings and to incorporate new services and training
that answer to these additional demands from the hematology community. These 16 services and related training
are designed to address challenges facing hematology laboratories, including (1) the relative lack of access to
primary human cell populations and high commercial prices for the study of human hematopoiesis, (2) the wide
spread interest in emerging cell preparation and analysis techniques which are difficult to establish and optimize,
(3) the need to access primary patient samples, and (4) the necessity to train junior researchers to perfrom
essential hematology research techniques with rigor and high reproducibility. Core A will continue to be directed
by Dr. Diane Krause with the assistance of Associate Director Dr. Jun Lu. Additionally, Drs. Gary Kupfer and
Manoj Pillai will be Key Core Faculty participating in Core A services. Drs. Krause, Lu, Kupfer and Pillai have
extensive hematology research experience, which will be utilized to direct two research staff to provide effective
services to YCCEH members and those in other NIDDK CCEH consortium. Junior investigators are particularly
encouraged to use the Core services. Through centralization of key hematology techniques and establishment
of a common platform for training, Core A will help individual laboratories to considerably increase research
efficiency, reduce expense, and save valuable investigator time. The training aspect of the core will allow efficient
dissemination of relevant techniques and prevent redundancy of such efforts in member laboratories at Yale and
across the nation. By maintaining and providing exciting new emerging technologies, Core A fulfills the overall
goal of YCCEH so that innovative technical advances are shared and positively leveraged for the advancement
of non-malignant hematology research."

Imaging Core
The Imaging Core of the YCCEH has provided access to state-of-the-art microscopy for benign hematology to
progressively more users each year. In this renewal, we propose to continue operations with enhancements
including longterm timelapse with decreased phototoxicity, adapted super resolution imaging for hematopoietic
tissues and automated high-throughput microscopy for imaging of 1,000 to 10,000 cells/24 hrs at super-
resolution. Hematopoiesis is a complex and dynamic process involving many heterologous cell types. Due to
the rich spatial and/or temporal information contained in imaging data, imaging is uniquely powerful in
revealing the influences of cellular dynamics and tissue organization on the relevant cells and states. As many
hematopoietic cells are small in size, minimally adhesive, difficult to manipulate genetically, reside in deep
tissues, highly dynamic and/or exceedingly rare, the ability to apply imaging approaches to hematopoiesis
research has been limited to few laboratories with the requisite technical expertise and instrumentation.
YCCEH Imaging Core aims to reduce the high technical hurdle and promote the application of imaging
techniques for hematopoietic research. Yale is the home of many state-of-the-art imaging equipment and
facilities overseen by world-renowned leaders and experts in microscopy. The YCCEH Imaging Core will make
the large array of imaging platforms readily accessible to all investigators with a research interest in
hematopoiesis, locally or nationally. YCCEH Imaging Core will continue to provide its members with access to
state-of-the-art instrumentation including widefield, confocal, 2-photon and flow cytometry imaging. Importantly,
through this Imaging Core, we are making it available as a service, access to and expertise in using innovative
imaging modalities including automated long-term live-cell time-lapse microscopy, optical clearing of tissue and
super-resolution microscopy. The directors of the Core, Drs. Bewersdorf and Guo will act as liaisons between
YCCEH members and the participating facilities and labs and will help identifying most suitable techniques for
individual research projects. The Imaging Core will also support two part time imaging specialists who will train
YCCEH members, maintain the instruments provided by the Bewersdorf and Guo labs and assist with
reagents, sample preparation and data analysis. We will continue to promote the dissemination of knowledge
for imaging in hematopoietic research by organizing symposia, workshops, seminars and training with an
emphasis on students, trainees and other early-stage investigators. Furthermore, the Imaging Core will
continue to develop, optimize and disseminate innovative reporters/probes that are suitable for analyzing
hematopoietic cells by fluorescence imaging and/or flow cytometry. We will continue to encourage YCCEH
members to evaluate various microscopy techniques for their research projects through the user incentive
program, by eliminating the psychological hurdle of investing funds into an unfamiliar technical domain.
Overall, the Imaging Core will facilitate and enable individual hematopoietic researchers to make observations
of their specific hematopoietic cell linages, using approaches that can provide unique structural, functional
and/or dynamic information."
10899670,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ 
The mission of the Animal Modeling Core (AMC) is to provide research groups within the YCCEH and the larger

allow researchers to ask questions about the function of molecules, cell populations, and tissues within the 
relevant spatial and temporal contexts. The YCCEH will continue to provide scientists training and facilitate 
research in mouse models of hematologic diseases. Importantly, the AMC will continue to develop and propagate 
the most innovative humanized mouse models for the study of human hematopoiesis and diseases thereof with 
the goal to overcome major shortcomings of current models. The AMC consists of two cores, the Humanized 
Mouse Core (HMC) and the Murine Stem Cell Transplantation Core (mSCTC). The Animal Modeling Core will 
be directed by Dr Richard Flavell, Sterling Professor of Immunobiology and co-directed by Dr. Stephanie Halene, 
Associate Professor and Acting Section Chief of Hematology. The HMC will offer expertise, technical assistance, 
and mice for human-into-mouse xenotransplantation studies. The mSCTC will offer training and technical 
assistance in the study of hematopoiesis and benign hematologic questions in mice. The Humanized Mouse 
Core will facilitate human-into-mouse xenotransplantation studies into immunodeficient mice. As a unique feature 
the Yale HMC will offer hematology researchers access to novel humanized immunodeficient mice optimized to 
support human hematopoietic stem cells, trilineage hematopoiesis, mature myeloid cells, red cells and platelets 
in circulation, and a functional human immune system. The Murine Stem Cell Transplantation Core will provide 
technical expertise in the study of hematologic questions in mice. The mSCTC will offer training and expertise 
for the study of hematopoiesis and hematologic diseases in mice using hematopoietic cell transplantation and 
functional assays. The Animal Modeling Core will be an integral part of the YCCEH. It will provide Hematology 
researchers with access to state-of-the-art technologies for in vivo studies of hematopoiesis and hematologic 
diseases. It will provide teaching, expertise, and resources in an economical way. Its cores will support basic 
science as well as translational studies, key to understanding and cure of hematologic diseases."

Hematology Seminar Series, a ‘Leaders in Science’ course for post-doctoral fellows (from Yale and other
CCEH sites), a Summer Enrichment Research Program for Underrepresented Minority Undergraduate
Students from local colleges in New Haven, and a research exchange program for trainees from other CCEH
sites. Though the budget for this Enrichment Program is not large, the anticipated return on investment
(including the impact of the proposed seminars, inspired mentoring, and training opportunities for young
hematology researchers) will be long lasting. The long-term goal of this Enrichment Program, relevant to public
health, includes strengthening the ‘bench to bedside and back’ hematology discovery model. Taken in
combination, the proposed U54 Cores and Programs will have a sustained, powerful influence on the future of
hematology research and, ultimately, on patient care."

10899734,"PROJECT SUMMARY BIOINFORMATICS AND DATA INTEGRATION CORE (BDIC)
Systematic analysis of the translational relevance of marmoset models of Alzheimer’s disease will require a
centralized data management and analysis team that interacts with all Projects and Cores. To this end, the
Bioinformatics and Data Integration Core (BDIC) will: generate multi-omics data to characterize marmoset
genomes, proteomes, and transcriptomes; provide data processing and storage for sequencing, genomics, and
similar molecular data; import and curate data and results from relevant human genetic and genomic studies;
create the processes and tools to systematically align human and marmoset data for multi-scale cross-species
analyses; and create and populate a data-sharing platform for broad and open access of all data and protocols.
This core will address this goal through the following aims: (1) generate, process, and manage genome-scale
molecular data from aging outbred and mutant marmoset populations; (2) develop and apply statistical methods
for rigorous marmoset and cross-species data analysis based on matched multi-omic measures; and (3) broadly
disseminate data and protocols through open science platforms to ensure reliable replication of studies and
reuse of all marmoset data. The BDIC will build upon existing resources such as the AD Knowledge Portal, the
Agora platform, Alz-PED, and the workflows from existing NIA-funded consortia, including AMP-AD, TREAT-AD,
MODEL-AD, MOVE-AD, and Resilience-AD. We will add the outcomes of this marmoset-centered project to this
foundation to optimize translational relevance and responsible data reuse. In achieving these goals, the BDIC
will manage data and facilitate its integrated analysis in multiple contexts across multiple project components.
Internal and external researchers will be positioned to efficiently and reliably assess the disease relevance of
marmoset models and associated phenotypes. Finally, the broader research community will be empowered to
use the marmoset as a model to understand and guide their research into therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease."
10899680,"Project Summary
The goal of this project is to develop a completely non-invasive, precise and durable treatment option for low
back pain, which is estimated to cost $30 billion in direct health care expenditures annually. Chronic LBP is
often a diagnostic and management challenge due to multiple potential pain sources with both biomechanical
and inflammatory mechanisms. The failure of systemic analgesic drugs, such as opioids, is often due to their
off-target toxicity, development of tolerance, and abuse potential. Interventional pain procedures provide target
specificity but lack long-term efficacy and are associated with procedural risks. Understanding the
supratentorial effects of such treatments may be an important part of developing effective treatment modalities.
Focused ultrasound (FUS) is a lower risk, completely non-invasive modality that enables the delivery of
spatially-confined acoustic energy to a small tissue region (dorsal root ganglion [DRG]) under magnetic
resonance (MR) imaging guidance to treat axial low back pain by neuromodulation.
The central goal of this study is to demonstrate neuromodulation of the DRG with FUS to decrease nerve
conduction, which can be used to attenuate pain sensation. In the first Aim, we will establish
electrophysiologic normative data for detecting changes in pain in neuritis models and normals
measured by EEG and somatosensory evoked potentials. In the second Aim, we will demonstrate FUS
neuromodulation of the DRG in pigs by (a) exploring FUS sonication parameters that results in DRG
neuromodulation as assessed by SEPs during nerve stimulation and (b) evaluating the safety and efficacy of
non-invasive FUS neuromodulation in neuritis pig model and controls by performing longitudinal unique
behavioral assessments, which specifically test behaviors indicative of supraspinal pain sensation. In the third
Aim, we will design and construct an LBP-specific MRgFUS device for rapid translation to patients with
back pain by fully characterizing FUS sonications for DRG neuromodulation using regulatory standards,
constructing an MRI radiofrequency coil and transducer mount to allow targeting of the DRG in humans, and
evaluating the prototype for image and sonication quality.
This exploratory study will demonstrate 1) using FUS on the DRG to interrupt and modulate nerve conduction,
2) using somatosensory evoked potentials to monitor brain changes and unique behavioral assessments in a
pig model after modulating the effect of pain stimuli, 3) the safety of FUS DRG neuromodulation, and 4) a
prototype for human use. Importantly, the low risk associated with FUS neuromodulation, compared to invasive
procedures, will result in rapid clinical translation.
We propose that FUS is a noninvasive modality to treat chronic low back pain with neuromodulation and has
the potential to replace current invasive or systemically detrimental treatment modalities. By demonstrating that
neuromodulation with FUS can alter pain perception with cortical monitoring and with behavioral assessments,
with the ultimate goal of developing a completely non-invasive system to treat low back pain and adjust the
treatment in real-time depending on the cortical response. The lower risk associated with neuromodulation,
compared to more invasive procedures, will result in fast translation to humans."

10904774,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Narcolepsy with cataplexy is a debilitating neurological disorder that results in sleep attacks during the day and
fragmented sleep at night. This condition is associated with the loss of hypocretin/orexin (HCRT/OX) neurons in
the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), which are important regulators of sleep/wake behavior and arousal states.
Despite a broad array of work investigating HCRT/OX neuron function in physiology and behavior, comparatively
little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying their synaptic structure and function. Based on the
results of our lab’s recent single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of the LHA, we propose that C1ql3,
encoding C1QL3, a previously described excitatory synapse organizing protein in other brain regions, may
likewise be an important element in excitatory synaptic transmission in HCRT/OX neurons, and help us shed
light on the molecular components of these important arousal-regulating synapses. To test this, I will confirm the
expression of C1ql3 and its gene product C1QL3 in HCRT/OX neurons, at both the mRNA and protein levels
(Aim 1). I will then conditionally knock out the C1ql3 gene in HCRT/OX neurons to determine the consequences
of its deletion on HCRT/OX synaptic structure and function (Aim 2), as well as its potential importance for
HCRT/OX neuron function in promoting arousal (Aim 3). This work will have several important outcomes,
including 1) identifying the role of a novel genetic marker in HCRT/OX neurons, 2) informing us of the importance
of C1QL3 in synaptic function and behavior relating to HCRT/OX neurons, and 3) provide me with training in
neuroscience techniques ranging from cellular and molecular to behavioral to enable me to become a more well-
rounded scientist and scientific communicator, as I pursue my goal of becoming an independent researcher."

Peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) is a multi-functional enzyme that expresses glutathione peroxidase, phospholipase A2,
and lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase activities in separate catalytic sites. Prdx6 can reduce
phospholipid hydroperoxides and hydrolyze and re-acylate phospholipid fatty acyl bonds. Prdx6 is, therefore, a
complete enzyme for the repair of peroxidized cell membranes. Our lab studies the contributions of the
different catalytic activities of Prdx6 to the suppression of ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell
death driven by the accumulation of phospholipid hydroperoxides. Ferroptosis is implicated in
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, but the role of Prdx6 in this process is unknown. Here, we propose studying
how Prdx6 regulates ferroptosis in cellular renal I/R models. Renal I/R is the most prevalent cause of acute
kidney injury, a clinically impactful disease that significantly affects patient management regarding the
treatment options for their primary disease. We will use flow-adapted endothelial cells and kidney organoids
derived from Prdx6 KO and KI mice carrying single point mutations that inactivate each of the Prdx6 activities
alone to study how Prdx6 regulates oxidant stress, ferroptosis, and inflammatory signaling in renal I/R while
providing postdoctoral training to Dr. Justin Conner who seeks to expand his skills and become a competitive
candidate for a MOSIAC K99/R00 application in next two years, with the ultimate goal to become an

Ultrasound is a ubiquitous clinical imaging modality supported by a dynamic and scholarly research community.
Until the inaugural Gordon Research Conference (GRC), no conference or professional meeting was explicitly
dedicated to basic science ultrasound research with the goal of improving diagnostic ultrasound. The first GRC
on in vivo ultrasound imaging found an exceptional reception and outstanding feedback. Discussion among the
2022 participants quickly demonstrated the strong need to propose a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS). GRC
and GRS will provide an intimate forum for scientific exchange among scientists and researchers whose primary
area of research is the development of novel biomedical ultrasound techniques and approaches. The proposed
inaugural GRS will feature 3 sessions with dedicated discussion leaders and 11 student speakers selected from
abstract submissions. A 4-member panel discussion on mentorship will conclude the GRS and create a transition
to the GRC for 5 days of fostering discourse and mentoring between trainees and researchers/educators.
Steep increases in real-time computing capabilities, out-of-the-box approaches, and progressive technology
integration have led to dramatic advances in ultrasound imaging and therapy. We are observing the advent of
neuromodulation, wearable ultrasound devices, immunotherapy, super-resolution imaging, and the previously
unthinkable lung ultrasound. In total, they are indicative of a vibrant and active research community. Therefore,
it is vital that this community is provided with an avenue that allows deeper discussion about the future and
direction of in vivo ultrasound and provides engagement of researchers spanning from senior to new and young
investigators. This second biennial Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and inaugural Gordon Research
Seminar (GRS) on In Vivo Ultrasound Imaging aims to provide this avenue for engaging the basic science
ultrasound research community. Ultimately, the success of this conference will result in a recurring
meeting/seminar series to bring research professionals in the area of ultrasound imaging together to address
the latest trends and needs in diagnostic ultrasound. The main goals of the GRC/GRS are: (1) to provide an
avenue to discuss the latest ground-breaking and critical-need technologies in biomedical ultrasound; (2) to
stimulate cross-pollination and validation of different approaches for ultrasound imaging, i.e., to become a
thinktank within the ultrasound imaging community; (3) to identify the needs for the continuing development of
novel ultrasound imaging technologies and where new methods and approaches can be implemented; and (4)
to promote the work of new and young investigators. The GRC and GRS scientific topics focus on ultrasonic
imaging and highlight the latest advancements in diagnostic ultrasound, including ultrasound applications in

10903434,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a global health pandemic that results from a combination of defective insulin secretion
and impaired insulin action in the peripheral tissues. T2D typically arises in the context of obesity and
overnutrition; however, genetic and physiologic data suggest that inadequate insulin secretion from the  cell is
the chief determinant predicting the development of overt T2D. Recent studies have identified  cell
dedifferentiation, in which  cells downregulate key identity markers, lose insulin secretory function, and
differentiate into other endocrine cell types, as one potential mechanism leading to  cell failure in T2D; however,
the molecular mechanisms leading to  cell dedifferentiation in T2D are not well understood. Calcium (Ca2+)
plays a vital role in regulating  cell health and function. In the  cell, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as
the dominant Ca2+ store, and store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) functions to maintain robust ER Ca2+ levels.
When ER Ca2+ is depleted, SOCE is activated by stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), which promotes Ca2+
influx from the extracellular space to refill depleted ER Ca2+ stores. Recently our laboratory found that obese
female mice with reduced SOCE due to  cell-specific genetic deletion of STIM1 had evidence of  cell
dedifferentiation. Further, islets isolated from these mice had reduced G protein coupled estrogen receptor
(GPER) mRNA and protein expression with no change in Estrogen Receptor  or  expression, suggesting a
potential interaction between SOCE, GPER signaling, and  cell identity. My preliminary data has extended these
observations and linked loss of GPER and loss of estradiol signaling through GPER with loss of  cell identity
and potential  cell dedifferentiation. Against this background, I hypothesize that decreased SOCE leads to
reduced GPER signaling and loss of  cell identity and function, thereby contributing to the
pathophysiology of T2D in females. I will test this hypothesis through two specific aims. In Aim 1, I will define
the role of GPER in  cell differentiation status. In Aim 2, I will define the relationship between impaired SOCE
and GPER function and expression/subcellular localization. Completion of this project has the potential to identify
a novel mechanism linking SOCE and GPER signaling to  cell failure during T2D. With this F30 Predoctoral
Fellowship, I will have the support to complete this research and master the objectives of my training plan: 1)
Create a strong foundation of techniques and concepts critical in diabetes research and islet biology, 2) Build
strong technical skills in super-resolution nanoscopy, 3) Develop and refine my clinical skills, and 4) Create a
strong foundation of written and oral scientific communication. My training will be supported by the experienced
faculty provided by the Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases at the Indiana University School of Medicine
and the Purdue University Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering. In summary, this comprehensive research
strategy and training plan will provide me with the skillset needed to reach my long-term career goal of becoming
a physician scientist trained to perform clinically translatable, innovative, and rigorous diabetes research."
10904471,"Project Summary
The primary objective of this project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the structures and functions of
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which play critical roles in brain functions and development.
NMDARs belong to the ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) family, which mediates the majority of excitatory
synaptic transmission in mammalian brains. Dysfunctional NMDARs are implicated in neurological disorders and
diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, depression, stroke, schizophrenia, and seizure. They are hetero-
tetrameric ligand-gated ion channels comprised of GluN1 and GluN2 and/or GluN3 subunits. The GluN1 and
GluN3 subunits bind to glycine, while the GluN2 subunits specifically bind to glutamate. Each NMDAR subunit
harbors distinct domains: an amino-terminal domain (ATD), a ligand-binding domain (LBD), a transmembrane
domain (TMD), and a carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD). The GluN1-2 NMDARs open their transmembrane ion
channels upon binding glycine and glutamate. NMDAR subtypes are defined by different combinations of
subunits: four distinct GluN2 subunits (A through D) or two distinct GluN3 subunits (A and B) in conjunction with
GluN1. These various subtypes exhibit unique functional properties and display spatiotemporal expression
patterns in the brain. In the previous grant cycles, we (1) developed the insect cell expression system, EarlyBac,
for effective expression of NMDARs and other complex membrane proteins; (2) elucidated the structure, function,
and pharmacology of GluN2C and 2D NMDARs by X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryo-EM; (3)
structurally characterized channel blockers and functional antibodies against GluN1-2B NMDARs; and (4)
structurally captured pre-active and antagonized states of GluN1-2B NMDARs. Despite these advances, there
are still many fundamental questions remaining unanswered, including (a) the lack of a structural basis for the
ligand-gated channel activity due to the absence of open NMDAR channel structure and Mg2+-blocked NMDAR
structure; (b) the lack of a structural basis for the excitatory glycine receptor, GluN1-3 NMDAR; and (c) the lack
of insights into subunit composition of native NMDARs in the brain and structural basis for CTD. We will conduct
research aimed at fulfilling these shortfalls. Aim 1 will capture the open gate, and Mg2+ blocked NMDAR
structures. Aim 2 will reveal the first structures of GluN1-3A NMDAR in various functional states. Aim 3 will
identify NMDAR subtypes in animal brains and capture the CTD, highlighting the NMDAR-calmodulin interaction.
These three aims will be achieved by obtaining the structural information of intact NMDAR by single-particle
cryo-EM and the CTD fragment by x-ray crystallography. Structure-based mechanistic hypotheses will be
examined mainly by electrophysiology. Completing the proposed research aims will represent major advances
in understanding the structures and functions of NMDAR subtypes, which will help develop therapeutic strategies
for neurological disorders and diseases."
10903172,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite national health guidelines and the prevalence of alcohol-related cardiovascular disease, alcohol
remains among the most popular recreational substances misused across the lifespan. Drinking behaviors are
often initiated in early adulthood and, in the absence of overt illness or diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder
(AUD), may be maintained for decades. Such drinking often occurs on a backdrop of chronic stress, even in
ostensibly healthy young adults. Further, recent societal shifts in perspectives and laws surrounding
recreational cannabis use have encouraged open positivity around alcohol co-use behaviors, even in otherwise
health-conscious individuals. A critical public health problem in fighting cardiovascular disease is that alcohol-
related physical health deterioration is insidious, evolving slowly as the result of chronic allostatic pressure
placed on organ systems by alcohol in combination with other lifestyle factors. Alcohol acutely elicits both
vasodilation and vasoconstriction that undoubtedly amplifies tension on the vasculature; yet, symptoms of
vascular injury (e.g., coronary artery disease) are often hidden until >90% vessel occlusion. This makes it
difficult for most people to ‘connect’ health behaviors, like alcohol consumption, to vascular degeneration. This
application proposes that identification of early biomarkers of alcohol’s effects on the vasculature are critically
needed to lower the prevalence of alcohol-related cardiovascular disease. The NIAAA F31 application
proposes a novel study design and analytical approach to unravel individualized vascular dynamics across the
blood alcohol concentration (BAC) curve in relation to chronic alcohol use behaviors (Research Aim 1), a
concurrent acute stressor (Research Aim 2), and alcohol/cannabis co-use behaviors (Research Aim 3). The
single-session alcohol administration study of chronic binge versus non-binge drinkers incorporates a periodic
isometric handgrip task, an acute vascular challenge that can magnify vascular responses, during peak
intoxication and recovery to evaluate adaptive potential. Recent cannabis use, measured from urinary THC
metabolite concentration, on vascular responsivity will be also explored. A multilevel mixed modeling approach
will capture changes in continuous blood pressure during the alcohol challenge alone and during the grip tasks.
This research study will be supported by extensive training in alcohol studies, with a focus on pharmacological
effects of alcohol (Training Goal 1), alcohol/cannabis interactions (Training Goal 2), cardiovascular physiology
(Training Goal 3), and advanced statistical design (Training Goal 4). Together, the research and training plans
will lay the foundation for the applicant’s future line of research to examine physiological factors that ultimately
contribute to the development of alcohol-related disease across the lifespan. Receiving the NRSA F31
fellowship will relieve the applicant from a time-intensive teaching assistant position to effectively double his
time available to conduct research and establish a strong professional network (Training Goal 5) within the field
of alcohol studies."

Structured RNAs play fundamental roles in biological processes and are actively being pursued as targets to
treat disease. Furthermore, synthetic RNA-based biosensors and therapeutics – inspired by natural RNA
machines – are beginning to come online. These RNAs can undergo conformational transitions to bind small
molecules and perform biochemical reactions. Unfortunately, incomplete models of RNA structure and how it
recognizes molecules hinder the development of these potential novel devices and treatments. Without
predictive biophysical models, the field relies on extensive experimental methods to probe RNA 3D structure,
dynamics, and ligand binding. Experiments such as NMR, cryo-electron microscopy, phylogenetic analysis, and
biochemical methods, although powerful, often fail to completely capture an RNA’s structural dynamics and
conformational changes. To address these challenges, the Yesselman Lab is developing novel models of RNA
3D structure and design. We have demonstrated the first high-resolution RNA 3D helical thermodynamics model,
automated design of RNA 3D structure, and developed novel experimental methods to probe secondary and 3D
structures. Over the next five years, the Yesselman Lab aims to improve our understanding and predictive
models of RNA conformational dynamics, RNA-ligand binding, and RNA catalysis: (1) RNA conformational
dynamics: utilizing novel RNA 3D design and massively parallel biochemical assays, our goal is to develop
general models for RNA 3D dynamics to understand better how RNA undergoes conformational transitions and
binds to ligands. (2) RNA-ligand interactions: our goal is to build the first predictive model of RNA/drug
interactions by assaying the effects of small molecule drugs on thousands of RNA structures combined with
novel machine learning approaches. (3) RNA catalytic activity: self-cleaving ribozymes can cut RNA strands.
Compared to proteins, ribozymes are significantly less active. A key difference is ribozymes often have less 3D
scaffolding. When they do, they contain long-range tertiary contacts, but the strength and placement of these
interactions can dramatically affect catalysis activity. Determining the rules of 3D scaffolding in ribozymes will
increase our understanding of RNA catalysis and enable the design of new ribozymes for other catalytic
functions. Findings from these research areas will address challenges and advance knowledge in RNA folding,
molecular recognition, and design. Ultimately, our research program will play a critical role in developing the next
generation of RNA-based diagnostics and therapeutics."

The current F99/K00 proposal outlines an integrated pre- and post-doctoral training plan that will result in the
applicant being prepared to independently conduct cutting edge interdisciplinary biopsychosocial research.
Training goals will augment her solidify her strengths with emerging skills while also attending to professional
development and career advancement. The project proposed spans psychosocial stress related outcomes that
impact neurological health, specifically as it pertains to MS. To reach this goal, the applicant proposes training
in (TG1) Stress Biology which will build on her prior biobehavioral expertise to extend to novel biospecimens
and study populations and to complement stress biology with subjective measures of stress and discrimination;
(TG2) Neuroscience, especially structural (MRI) measures which complements her prior EEG work; (TG3)
Multiple Sclerosis as a debilitating neurological disease with causes brain atrophy but for whom severity of
cognitive and physiological clinical outcomes continue to elude the field; and (TG4) Racial Health Disparities
which can help shed light on underpinnings for individual differences in clinical MS outcomes through
application of theories like Weathering and Intersectionality. The proposal spans two primary sites with an
established history of working together which allows the applicant to accomplish innovative work and with an
experienced mentor team who work well together through a “community of learning” format and application of
Agile Methodology to help the applicant achieve project milestones. The applicant’s long-term goal is to
become a transdisciplinary scholar who excels at both stress biology and neuroscience as well as critical race
theories and the phenomenology of health disparities. Not only does the applicant seek to increase diversity in
the sciences, but the research proposed also will be instrumental for demonstrating the very real, tangible and
seemingly intractable impact of racism and discrimination. To achieve these goals, the project proposes three
aims as aligned with the aims F99/K00 guidelines. Aim 1b describes the dissertation progress thus far, which
includes obtaining approvals for pilot data to establish feasibility at the study site as part of the applicant’s
Research Internship, completing training in all study measures including MRI, clinical MS outcomes, hair
cortisol assays and scoring self-reported measures, and collecting pilot data for power analysis calculations.
Aim 1b outlines work to be completed during the F99, focusing on a conceptual model (and corresponding
hypotheses) in which the primary association between brain atrophy and clinical MS outcomes is interrogated
in terms of sources of health disparities and then specific moderators are proposed such as hair cortisol and
discrimination. Aim 2 describes the postdoctoral research direction as possible next research steps and career
moves that will set up the applicant’s career in a way that enhances likelihood of success as a transdisciplinary
scholar advancing understanding of how stress gets under the skin to impact health."

 Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality world-wide. It is clear that vascular smooth
muscle cells (SMCs) play a critical role in plaque progression and stability, but many questions remain in
regard to the source, fate, and function of the phenotypically modulated SMCs within the protective fibrous cap
and necrotic core. Defects in SMC function that lead to hypertension (HTN) and increased vascular stiffness
also affect plaque formation and progression by altering mechanical signaling within the vessel wall. Although
these physiologic parameters are major independent cardiovascular risk factors, we know surprisingly little
about their development, their inter-relationship, or the mechanisms by which they promote atherosclerosis.
We have previously shown that the SMC-selective Rho-specific GAP, GRAF3, reduces blood pressure in mice
and humans by limiting RhoA-dependent SMC contractility in resistance arterioles and went on to identify
rs604723 as the causal variant within the BP-associated locus in this gene. Our more recent data indicate that
GRAF signaling is atheroprotective and inhibits the expression of the contractile and extracellular matrix genes
that drive vascular stiffness, and the pro-inflammatory and pro-calcification gene programs that contribute to
atherosclerotic plaque development and rupture. The overall goals of this proposal are to assess the role of
GRAF3 genotype on cardiovascular outcomes in a large and diverse cardiovascular disease patient
population, to directly measure the contribution of GRAF signaling to atherosclerosis and vascular stiffening,
and to use our understanding of GRAF intra-molecular interactions to identify GRAF-activating compounds that
could be useful for treating HTN and atherosclerotic disease."
10880664,"Abstract
Publiclyavailable genetic summary data canhave high utility for providing insight into genetic etiology
of health and disease. Databases of genotype frequencies, such as the genome Aggregation Database
(gnomAD), are used to prioritize putative causal variants and, more recently, as pseudo-controls in
case-control analysis. Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) test statistics are used in a variety of
secondary data analyses including polygenic risk scores (PRS), genetic correlation analysis, and fine
mapping of causal variants. Compared with individual level data, genetic summary data often has fewer
barriers in access, promoting broad use of these valuable data resources. The availability and use of
summary genetic data is often not equitable across all ancestral groups, especially for understudied
ancestral groups that have little to no representation within these resources. Furthermore,
heterogeneity within the summary data can lead to confounding and reduced power for case-control
analysis, incorrect prioritization of putative causal variants for rare diseases, and reduced accuracy for
polygenic risk scores. I develop robust and efficient methods to appropriately use genetic summary
data while estimating, modeling, and harnessing the heterogeneity within. My methods coalesce around
a unifying framework where I flip the paradigm of genetic and genomic data treating the genetic variant
or element as the observational unit by which we analyze the data rather than the individual. This
simple, yet innovative paradigm shift enables the use of classical statistical techniques and the creation
of methods that detect, adjust for, and even use heterogeneity within summary level data. To enable
broad and equitable use of our methods, we will create publicly available R packages compatible with
Bioconductor and Shiny Apps for interactive internet use."

10904368,"Project summary/Abstract
Adolescence is a developmental period marked by risk-taking behavior and exploration, and
over 60% of 12th-graders in the US reported trying alcohol. In fact, 16% of 12th graders reported
binge drinking, or consuming 5+ drinking in a session. While human studies show that
adolescent binge drinking impacts cognitive performance and neural signals via MRI, it is
difficult to tease apart antecedent factors that may lead to binge drinking from the
consequences of the resulting alcohol exposure on the developing brain. We and others have
used animal models to show that binge-levels of alcohol exposure is sufficient to reduce
cognitive and behavioral flexibility in conditioning tasks. Moreover, these behavioral changes
are associated with a variety of neurochemical, physiological, molecular and epigenetic changes
in the brain. We have reported that adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure resulted
deficient reversal learning, in that rats perseverated on a previously reinforced choice instead of
shifting to a different choice. We also found that AIE-exposed rats exhibited reduced functional
connectivity, measured with resting-state fMRI, among regions of interest that underlie
behavioral choice. Finally, we and others have reported AIE-induced increases in perineuronal
nets (PNNs, extracellular matrix structures that encapsulate parvalbumin (PV)-expressing
interneurons) in frontal regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex. This is important as PV+
interneurons contribute to gamma oscillations that would be reflected in functional connectivity
measures. However, it is unknown whether AIE-induced increases in PNNs contribute to the
AIE-induced behavioral and functional connectivity deficits. This project addresses that
knowledge gap by enzymatically degrading PNNs in the OFC of AIE-exposed rats and
measuring subsequent effects on reversal learning and functional connectivity MRI. To our
knowledge, the resulting data will be the first to link PNN integrity in the OFC to behavioral
flexibility and functional connectivity. These data will contribute to our understanding of the
mechanisms by which AIE persistently disrupts behavior and brain circuit function and lay the
foundation for strategies to ameliorate these effects."

10898703,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (PRAGMATIC TRIAL)
The objective of the University of Pennsylvania Telehealth Research Center in Cancer Care (Penn TRC)
Pragmatic Trial is to compare the effectiveness of four adaptive telehealth strategies on shared decision
making (SDM) for lung cancer screening. Annual lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography
(LDCT) is associated with decreased lung cancer mortality but also with harms. As such, it is recommended,
and required for reimbursement, that patients complete an SDM visit prior to screening to discuss potential
risks and benefits in the context of patient values. Despite guidelines recommending screening and national
insurance coverage of LDCT, uptake of SDM visits and subsequent LDCT is remarkably low. Even prior to the
COVID-19 pandemic, synchronous and asynchronous telehealth strategies were proposed as approaches to
expand access, but they have yet to be rigorously tested in real-world settings. With an estimated 14.5 million
US adults now eligible for screening based on expanded 2021 guidelines and persistent racial disparities in
lung cancer, the need for equitable and sustainable solutions is urgent. We aim to address these gaps by
comparing telehealth strategies informed by communication science and behavioral economics in a Pragmatic
Trial using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design, complemented by qualitative
comparative analysis. This will allow us to examine multilevel determinants contributing to the effectiveness of
the four strategies across and within diverse patients, with a health equity lens. In the first stage of the trial,
patients will be randomized to either telehealth SDM alone or active choice SDM, an approach informed by
behavioral economics in which patients will be presented with a choice of two alternatives to complete the
SDM visit: telehealth or in-person. Individuals in both arms who do not schedule an SDM visit (non-responders)
will be randomized to receive asynchronous nudges using framed messages alone (low touch strategy) or
nudges in combination with synchronous digital care coordination (high touch strategy). Prior to trial launch, we
will use rapid-cycle approaches to optimize delivery and content of telehealth strategies. The specific aims are
to: 1) Determine the effectiveness of telehealth strategies to increase SDM visits for patients eligible for lung
cancer screening using a patient-level pragmatic SMART design; 2) Assess the equity of telehealth strategies
by race and sex; and 3) Evaluate multilevel mechanisms contributing to the effectiveness and equity of
telehealth strategies using qualitative comparative analysis and our integrated conceptual framework. This
innovative Pragmatic Trial will contribute substantially to the Penn TRC’s goal of producing new fundamental
knowledge on telehealth with the potential to transform cancer care delivery, equity, and outcomes for millions
of Americans, with a particular emphasis on dramatically increasing SDM for lung cancer screening and
reducing lung cancer disparities."

divide. To do this, the Clinical Practice Network will provide leadership and access to Penn Medicine’s clinical
ecosystem – including patients, physicians and other clinical personnel, clinical sites, telehealth capacity, and
clinical informatics and data infrastructure – to ensure successful completion of the Center’s planned pragmatic
trial, pilot projects, and future research and dissemination. The Clinical Practice Network will provide the ideal
environment in which to generate a robust evidence base for patient-centered, sustainable telehealth models
of cancer care delivery, while also serving as a model for other systems across the country. We focus on lung
cancer as an exemplar model for telehealth across the care continuum, from screening to treatment to
survivorship. Penn Medicine serves a diverse patient population in the greater Philadelphia metropolitan area,
providing an ideal setting to test the effectiveness and equity of telehealth strategies and to identify how to
integrate optimally and sustain telehealth across the cancer care continuum. The Clinical Practice Network will
be an integrated and interdisciplinary effort embedded within the health system at Penn Medicine, with
academic and community clinical sites spanning primary care and oncology care, all served by a common lung
cancer screening program. Collectively, participating clinical sites serve more than 400,000 patients per year.
The Clinical Practice Network’s specific aims are to: 1) Provide access to a network of primary care, cancer
screening, and oncology clinical sites serving a diverse patient population; 2) Provide access to the telehealth,
clinical informatics, and data infrastructure needed to support the execution of the pragmatic trial and pilot
projects across the Clinical Practice Network; and 3) Provide leadership and integration of Penn TRC activities
across all components within the Clinical Practice Network and between the Clinical Practice Network and all
other components of the Penn TRC. Taken together, these aims ensure Penn TRC researchers will have the
requisite access to clinical sites and personnel, a diverse and large patient population, and the telehealth,
clinical informatics, and data infrastructure needed to implement and evaluate the telehealth strategies
proposed in the Pragmatic Trial and pilot projects. Achieving these aims will ensure the Penn TRC is

We seek funding for the conference ""Reversible Biological Acetylation in Health and Diseases"" under the
auspices of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB). The 2024 conference
will be the 9th meeting of this highly valued biennial conference. This unique forum attracts scientists with
diverse expertise in biochemistry, structural biology, cell and molecular biology, developmental biology,
translational and clinical research. We aim to showcase the latest conceptual insights and technical
advances in the field. This meeting is particularly timely because of exciting new fundamental discoveries in
the linkage of acetylation, metabolism, 3D chromatin and cancer. Furthermore, novel small molecular
inhibitors are being developed to effectively block oncogenic lysine acetyltransferases or lysine
deacetylases. A provisional cutting-edge program provides a balanced survey of groundbreaking basic
and translational research. Major topics include: 1) Writers of protein acetylation; 2) Readers of protein
acetylation; 3) Erasers of protein acetylation; 4) 3D chromatin organization; 5) Metabolic regulation of
reversible acetylation; 6) Biological acetylation in cancer; 7) Biological acetylation in development and
aging; 8) ‘Omics’ in acetylation; and 9) Chemical biology and drug development.
The FASEB meeting traditionally brings all participants in a single conference venue for unopposed sessions.
The format includes plenary and poster sessions, with the former covering state-of-the-art topics by leaders
in the field and cutting-edge and timely oral presentations selected from submitted poster abstracts from
junior colleagues, particularly pre- and post-doctoral trainees. This ensures active engagement of junior
participants in the conference and stimulates attendance at poster sessions. Moreover, there will be a ‘meet
the speaker’ period following each plenary session. Two interactive workshops are planned, one on diversity
networking, and another on career development for early investigators. Both workshops offer participants the
opportunity to informally share challenges and solutions that they encounter at the workplace and to promote
awareness of the diversity of peoples’ situations, allyship, networking and mentorship.
The primary objective of the conference is to bring together top basic scientists, and clinician investigators to
foster interdisciplinary collaborations. A second objective is to help development of a new generation of
scientists investigating molecular mechanisms involving KATs and KDACs. The organizers will make a
concerted effort to design a meeting that engages and serves our pre- and postdoctoral trainees, early-stage
independent investigators and scientists from under-represented groups. We provide travel awards and best-
poster awards as well as plenary talk opportunities for accomplished early investigators and investigators
from under-represented communities to enhance their international visibility and allow them to enjoy extended

10899739,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 The long-term goal of my research program is to be able to make mechanistic models for understudied
fungi, thus allowing us to understand new aspects of fungal biology. To build these models, and predict how
specific perturbations will affect the cell, it critical to have gene function annotations. However, the majority of
the genes in non-model organisms are still unannotated and uncharacterized. Our interest therefore lies in
building and testing computational models for predicting gene function in Candida auris, a newly emerging fungal
pathogen. To carry out this work, we will perform high-throughput transcriptomic studies to generate a co-
expression network, and then test the accuracy of this approach through functional genetic screening and
detailed molecular genetics. As an additional complication to understanding gene function, regulatory network
re-wiring is common throughout evolution, where the same key proteins respond to a suite of different inputs.
Understanding how these signaling cascades can be re-wired will give insight into both gene function and the
environmental stimuli that drive these changes. We will dissect, in molecular detail, the role of cis and trans
factors in network re-wiring between C. albicans and C. auris, using a conserved transcription factor as a case
study. These studies will provide fundamental data and cell biological knowledge to the community studying
fungi, and more broadly to those studying non-model organisms."

 A fundamental question in cell biology is how the proper level of cell contractility is generated
to drive cell and tissue morphogenesis. We know that cells must coordinate contractile events to
enable dynamic movements. We do not know how they generate and tune contractility in the right
place at the right time. Myosin 2 filaments are the dominant force-generating motor proteins in all
cells and tissues. Recent advances in light microscopy have enabled us to observe myosin 2
dynamics in living cells at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. We have observed
complexity at the subcellular level that we never considered or anticipated from decades of in vitro
studies. This proposal uses high-resolution imaging along with a toolbox of cellular and molecular
assays to dissect the mechanisms by which cells build actomyosin 2 contractile structures, tune
them to fit the cellular process, and deconstruct them. Recent discoveries have clearly shown that
after decades of investigation, myosin 2 is still holding secrets that we must uncover to fully
understand cellular contractility. We anticipate the completion of this work will answer current
questions and yield important new ones."

This research proposal aims to develop new immunogens for an HIV-1 vaccine by utilizing advanced protein design
techniques and deep learning methods. Conventional structure-guided approaches have limitations in achieving
desired structural characteristics. Therefore, this study proposes using RFdiffusion, ProteinMPNN, and AlphaFold2,
to generate new germline-targeting gp120 cores based on the pre-fusion native-like structure of the HIV-1 strain
426c. The designed immunogens prioritize maintaining the structural integrity of the pre-fusion gp120 while
removing the bridging sheet and re-designing specific regions to maintain the pre-fusion native-like backbone
structure. In addition, particular attention is directed towards masking off-target epitopes. In vitro characterization
will be performed to evaluate the binding characteristics of these immunogens with germline, broadly neutralizing,
and non-neutralizing antibodies. Subsequently, transgenic mice expressing human germline VRC01-class BCRs
will be utilized to assess the immunogenicity of selected immunogens presented on nanoparticles and analyze their
impact on germinal center B cell responses and memory B cell repertoire. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) obtained
from immunized animals will be structurally characterized, shedding light on antibody maturation pathways
influenced by the immunogen structure. Additionally, this research plan aims to expand the immunogen repertoire
by designing gp120 cores based from diverse HIV-1 clades/strains. Furthermore, to enhance immunogenicity,
membrane-bound and nanoparticles delivery through self-amplifying mRNA will be explored. The ultimate objective
of this research is to gain valuable insights into novel antigen design techniques and their application in HIV-1
vaccine strategies for broadly neutralizing antibodies development. The findings from this study will contribute to
the development of immunogens that closely resemble the pre-fusion gp120 state, potentially leading to enhanced
B-cell responses capable of generating broadly neutralizing antibody lineages. By addressing the complex features
of the HIV-1 Env protein and advancing immunogen design strategies, this research aims to make significant
contributions towards the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine."

Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of glaucoma that leads to irreversible vision
loss. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) due to dysfunction of trabecular meshwork (TM) tissue is a hallmark of
POAG. However, the pathological mechanisms leading to TM dysfunction and IOP elevation are poorly
understood. TM has an intrinsic ability to maintain IOP homeostasis by sensing the changes in the flow of
aqueous humor (AH). In this regard, we recently showed that Ca2+ influx through transient receptor potential
vanilloid 4 ion channels in the TM (TRPV4TM channels) lowers IOP via activation of endothelial nitric oxide
synthase (eNOS)–NO signaling. Importantly, we showed that TRPV4TM-eNOSTM signaling is impaired in
glaucomatous primary human TM cells. The major goals of this application are to elucidate the pathological
mechanisms that impair TRPV4TM-eNOSTM signaling in glaucoma and to target them for rescuing the TM
function. Chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a crucial contributor to TM dysfunction and IOP elevation
in glaucoma. In our preliminary studies, we observed that chronic ER stress activates inducible NOS (iNOS), an
enzyme commonly associated with the formation of oxidant molecule peroxynitrite (PN). PN levels are elevated
in TM tissues from POAG donor eyes and exogenous PN reduced TRPV4TM channel activity in human primary
TM cells. Moreover, induction of ER stress also lowered TRPV4TM channel activity. Therefore, we hypothesize
that PN-induced inhibition of TRPV4TM-eNOSTM signaling contributes to TM dysfunction and IOP
elevation in glaucoma. The major objectives of this application are to determine whether chronic ER stress
leads to TM dysfunction and IOP elevation via PN-induced lowering of TRPV4TM-eNOSTM signaling in glaucoma,
and to target this pathology for the treatment of glaucoma. In Aim 1, we will determine whether chronic ER stress
lowers TRPV4 channel activity in TM cells. In Aim 2, we will determine whether PN levels are elevated in
glaucoma and whether PN lowers TRPV4 channel activity in TM. We will also determine whether chronic ER
stress underlies elevated PN levels in glaucoma. In Aim 3, we will target PN pathology to lower elevated IOP in
mouse and human models of ocular hypertension. This proposal utilizes complementary expertise of Dr. Zode’s
laboratory in glaucoma research and ER stress, and Dr. Sonkusare’s laboratory in TRP ion channel imaging and
electrophysiology. This study will utilize state-of-art Ca2+ imaging, patch-clamp, eNOS activity, and nitric oxide

In brain regions involved in learning and memory, a subset of neurons active in response to a novel experience
is critical for encoding and later recalling a memory of that experience. These neurons, known as engram cells,
have been identified as vital contributors to memory function in areas such as the hippocampus. Studies of
engram cells have overwhelmingly used immediate-early gene (IEG) protein products to segregate active from
inactive cells. Yet, the downstream processes that allow IEG-expressing cells to encode memories in a way that
makes them selective to a particular event remain unknown. Single-nuclei RNA-Seq (snRNA-Seq) now offers
an opportunity to reveal molecular changes in these engram cells at the single neuron level. Within the
hippocampus, individual, active, IEG-expressing dentate granule cells (DGCs) show more dramatic
transcriptional changes than other hippocampal cell types when mice explore a novel environment. Long after
IEGs such as Fos and Arc decline, transcription of later waves of activity-regulated genes continues to distinguish
active and inactive DGCs for at least 24hr after an initial stimulating event. While the hippocampus as a whole
is critical for memory function, the unique contribution of the dentate gyrus is theorized to be discriminating
between memories of similar events, a process termed pattern separation. This project will seek to link
transcriptional changes in individual dentate gyrus engram cells to the dentate gyrus’ role in pattern
separation. The underlying hypothesis is that activity-induced transcription sets the selectivity of DGC engram
cells and in turn the effectiveness of the dentate gyrus in discriminating between similar memories. A series of
experiments will compare activity-induced transcription and engram cell selectivity under standard cognitive
conditions, enhanced cognitive conditions, and impaired cognitive conditions. First, a candidate gene
upregulated in activated DGCs from previous snRNA-Seq results, proenkephalin (Penk), will be manipulated in
healthy adult mice. Penk has received considerable attention in studies of reward and addiction, and this project
will now test a novel role in influencing engram cell selectivity. Second, transcriptional changes in individual
DGCs in control mice will be compared those in runners, who have enhanced dentate gyrus function and ability
to discriminate similar memories. Finally, transcriptional changes in individual DGCs will be compared between
wildtype mice and APP/PS1 mice, a model of Alzheimer’s Disease with impaired discrimination ability. The
experiments described here will identify detailed transcriptional signatures of individual dentate gyrus engram
cells during memory formation and connect these molecular changes to the dentate gyrus’ critical role in pattern
separation. The results obtained from this work will reveal fundamental biological processes that can be targeted
to enhance cognitive function in health and combat devastating memory decline in neurodegenerative disease."

 The proposed K23 Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is designed to provide the
candidate with the conceptual knowledge and technical skills needed for a career of an independent
investigator focused on the engagement of behavioral and neural network targets during personalized
psychotherapies for mid- and late depression. The candidate will conduct her training and research activities at
the ALACRITY Center of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry.
 The proposal is based on the premise that identifying specific behavioral and neural network targets
can guide development of streamlined interventions with potential for broad scalability and reach. “Engage”, a
streamlined therapy for late-life depression, whose principal intervention is “reward exposure”, may change
Positive Valence Systems (PVS) functions. Preliminary studies by the candidate show that early increase in
resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of PVS structures during “Engage” predicts increased behavioral
activation. Additionally, compared to solitary pleasant activities, exposure to rewarding social interactions
during “Engage” leads to greater increase in behavioral activation and reduction of depression severity. Finally,
a machine learning analysis conducted by the candidate showed that low perceived social support is the
strongest predictor of poor response early in psychotherapy. These findings are in line with animal and human
studies demonstrating the protective role of social rewards. Based on these observations, the candidate
developed “Engage-S”, a social-reward based version of “Engage”, aimed to increase exposure to meaningful
social interactions with others.
 The training study proposes to examine whether social reward exposure in “Engage-S” enhances PVS
abnormalities and improves mid- and late-life depression. The participants will be 60 middle-aged and older
adults (age ≥ 50) with major depression who will be randomized to 9-weeks of “Engage-S” or to a Symptom
Review and Psychoeducation (SRP) comparison condition. During treatment, we will examine target
engagement of the PVS with rsFC, a behavioral activation scale (BADS), and performance on a novel social
reward paradigm at baseline, 5 weeks, and 9 weeks. We will use computational methods to identify
neuroimaging and behavioral profiles associated with treatment response.
 The training plan consists of formal courses, structured tutorials, and hands-on methodological training
that will offer the candidate knowledge and skills in: 1) Functional neuroanatomy of depression and aging; 2)
Use of fMRI to assess target engagement during psychotherapies for mid- and late-life depression; 3)
Computational modeling for the identification of clinical and neuroimaging predictors of treatment response that
can be used to personalize psychotherapy; and 4) Generate preliminary data for an R-series experimental
therapeutics target engagement application."

 Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) is a clinically proven target to attenuate B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling in
B-cell malignancies, including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Ibrutinib, a
first-in-class, once-daily, oral covalent BTK inhibitor was approved by the FDA to treat relapsed/refractory MCL
in 2013 based on the multiple-center Phase II clinical trial led by Dr. Michael Wang (multi-PI on this application).
Although ibrutinib has been successful in treating MCL and CLL, acquired resistance arises quickly, mostly
through mutations in the BTK kinase domain to significantly reduce ibrutinib efficacy in CLL and the activation of
alternative survival pathways in MCL. Additionally, disrupting kinase function of BTK using kinase inhibitors is
the only currently available therapeutic intervention on this well-validated target. However, BTK can also enhance
antigen receptor-induced calcium influx in a kinase-independent manner, while a kinase inactive BTK mutant
can partially rescue B cell development of BTK-null B cells in mice. In this project, we will develop a small
molecule therapeutic agent that can efficiently inhibit and degrade BTK in cells irrespective of BTK mutation
status to abolish both BTK kinase and non-kinase activities completely. In our preliminary studies, we developed
RC-1 as the first reversible covalent chemistry-based BTK degrader. Based on our highly promising preliminary
studies, extensive expertise in drug development, and clinical expertise in MCL and CLL, we hypothesize that
further optimization of RC-1 will lead to a next-generation targeted therapy for MCL, CLL and other B-cell
malignances and significantly improve treatment outcomes. To achieve this goal, we have assembled a highly
motivated team with complementary expertise. Dr. J. Wang is an expert in chemical biology and drug discovery.
His previous work led to the development of the first-in-class inhibitor for steroid receptor coactivators, which is
under commercialization. His laboratory has established the full pipeline for drug discovery, including organic
synthesis, in vitro assays, ADMET profiling and preclinical efficacy testing. Dr. M. Wang (MD Anderson) and Dr.
Woyach (Ohio State) are leading physician scientists in lymphoma research, specializing in the BTK signaling
pathway. Dr. M Wang’s clinical studies led to the FDA approval of two BTK inhibitors, ibrutinib and acalabrutinib.
Dr. Woyach is a leader in ibrutinib-resistant mechanisms. In this project, we will further optimize BTK degraders
with drug-like properties and test the therapeutic efficacies in MCL and CLL mouse models. In our and others’
studies, BTK degraders can be more potent than inhibitors in certain B cell malignancies. This novel mechanism
of action for BTK targeting has never been explored in the clinic. We expect that successful completion of this

In nature, sensory perception and motor processing operate in closed-loop. Self-generated movements impact
sensory input, and sensory inputs guide future motor commands. Through experience, the brain may learn the
reciprocal relationship between sensory inputs and movements in the form of generative sensorimotor models
that predict the sensory consequences of upcoming actions. In vertebrates, olfaction is intrinsically linked to
motor action through sniffing, and just as for other sensory modalities, via head and body movements. Due to
technical challenges, however, most studies in laboratory settings have probed olfactory processing during
passive odor sampling. Even when investigating odor-driven navigation, the effect of movements on odor
responses has rarely been analyzed. Here we will test the central hypothesis that, in closed-loop olfaction,
mice generate olfacto-motor predictions on the sensory consequences of their actions, which further guide odor
sampling movements. At the circuit level, we hypothesize that specific olfactory cortex circuits represent olfacto-
motor prediction errors, computed by comparing odor input and movement-related predictions of the expected
odor input. We plan to test these hypotheses using a novel closed-loop odor localization task (Smellocator)
developed in our group, together with a rich repertoire of sensorimotor perturbations, state-of-the-art recordings
and cell-type circuit analysis tools with increasing levels of specificity.
● To this end, we will first investigate whether under closed-loop coupling of movements and odor sensing, mice
detect olfacto-motor errors, and further compensate for them. In the Smellocator task, head-fixed mice learn to
steer a lightweight lever with their paws to control the lateral location of an odor source according to a fixed-gain
sensorimotor mapping rule. In catch trials, we will transiently alter the relationship between lever movement and
odor displacement via a range of precise, unexpected sensorimotor perturbations. Preliminary data indicate that
expert mice successfully compute sensorimotor prediction errors, and quickly engage in fine corrective
movements triggered by these perturbations in an individual specific manner.
• Then, we will investigate whether the olfactory cortex (piriform vs. anterior olfactory nucleus) represents olfacto-
motor prediction errors in face of transient surprises. We will check whether brief sensorimotor perturbations
trigger sudden changes in cortical activity (mismatch responses). We will refine our analysis to determine if
different semilunar and pyramidal cells types (e.g. Netrin+, Cux1+, Tbr1+, Tle4+) represent primarily sensory
inputs vs. olfacto-motor errors by combining distributed recordings and modern genetic labeling strategies.
• Finally, we will investigate whether the olfactory cortex enables adaptation in the presence of persistent olfacto-
motor errors. We will change the sensorimotor mapping rules in blocks of trials, and across behavioral sessions,
and compare the roles of specific cell types in supporting sensorimotor adaptation taking advantage of flexible
optogenetic suppression strategies."

Proteogenomics involves the integrative multi-omic analysis of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and post-
translational modification data produced by next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry-based
proteomics. Several publications by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) and others
have highlighted the impact of proteogenomics in enabling deeper insight into the biology of cancer and
identification of potential drug targets. Integrative analysis of multi-omic data requires the deployment of
complex algorithms and data processing techniques, which are generally inaccessible to scientists without a
background in bioinformatics and computational biology.
Our proposed center for comprehensive proteogenomic data analysis will encapsulate a comprehensive
set of analysis methods in a platform that will be (i) simple to use (ii) flexible (iii) automated, facilitating the
routine application to all CPTAC proteogenomic datasets as they become available, and (iv) able to
incorporate new methods with minimal effort. We will leverage PANOPLY--a cloud-based platform for
automated and reproducible proteogenomic data analysis--as the foundation, with specific, carefully chosen
algorithms targeted for addition to provide an expansive set of analysis capabilities that can be easily
harnessed to provide a rapid and extensive baseline analysis for proteogenomic studies, leading to many
disease specific hypotheses that can be explored further using additional computational and wet-lab
experiments.
Our collection of tools, algorithms and interactive reports will enable unprecedented, automated and integrative
systems-biology level analyses of proteome, post-translational modification and metabolomic data combined
with genomic data for individual disease cohorts and pan-cancer analysis across cohorts, leading to deeper
understanding of cancer biology and enabling identification of therapeutic targets and disease/prognostic

Changes in ion channel biophysics and function due to mutation or disease-associated remodeling are
frequently assessed in isolated cells; yet translation of these mechanistic changes for therapeutic target
development is difficult and often fails due to the inherent lack of tissue-scale regulation that is missing
in isolated cell experiments. Sodium channel gain-of-function is a critical example of this translational
challenge, with well-identified ion channel biophysical dysfunction (i.e., gating); yet an estimated 16-
64% of congenital sodium channel gain-of-function patients present without an electrocardiographic
phenotype.
Our prior work demonstrated a proof-of-concept that modulation of ion concentrations in extracellular
nanodomains can conceal or unmask this gain-of-function, and these dynamics are an inherently
tissue-scale phenomenon, as the sodium channel enriched nanodomains adjacent to gap junctions at
the intercalated disc. The current proposal seeks to demonstrate that this concept has significant
potential for therapeutic target development and pre-clinical predictive assessment. Preliminary data
demonstrate that extracellular sodium and potassium (through co-regulation by intercalated disc-
localized potassium channels) can modulate the presentation of sodium channel gain-of-function in a
manner that depends on intercalated disc structure. We propose computational simulations (novel
structurally detailed tissue models) and experiments (isolated myocytes, ex vivo hearts, and in vivo
genetically-modified mice and peptide treated guinea pigs) to test the hypothesis that sodium and
potassium concentrations can serve as critical biomarkers that are co-factors for risk of
electrophysiological dysfunction in the setting of sodium channel gain-of-function and concomitant
perinexus expansion. While ion concentrations are already established biomarkers in clinical care, our
proposal will test the hypothesis that so called ‘normal’ ranges may indeed be pathological in patients
with sodium channel gain-of-function. Indeed, the standard collection of these biomarkers is an asset
for future work that will seek to identify patients at greater risk for electrophysiological dysfunction.
Upon successful completion of these aims, we will produce new mechanistic understanding of the
manifestation of sodium channel gain-of-function, which will demonstrate a mechanistic equivalency
between detection and therapy."
10879943,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The proposed project is focused on the mechanism controlling posterior elongation of the vertebrate
embryo, a process which is still poorly understood. In amniotes such as birds or mammals, the embryonic body
forms sequentially in a head-to-tail sequence. Progressively more posterior territories are laid in the wake of
regression movements of the primitive streak and tail bud (TB) [1]. Unlike anterior regions which mostly depend
on convergence extension, posterior elongation of the embryonic body of amniotes relies on volumetric growth.
Our past work showed how the paraxial mesoderm, which forms the skeletal muscles and vertebrae, drives
these posterior elongation movements [2]. We demonstrated that a posterior-to-anterior gradient of FGF signal-
ing established in the most posterior region of the paraxial mesoderm (called presomitic mesoderm (PSM)) im-
poses a parallel gradient of random cell motility in this tissue. This gradient is necessary for posterior elongation
of the embryo. Our findings led us to propose that the PSM can generate posteriorly oriented compression forces
that trigger axial elongation in response to the FGF gradient [3]. Indeed, we demonstrated that an isolated PSM
can generate FGF-dependent elongation forces when confined in a PDMS microchannel [4]. Our preliminary
data demonstrated that the extracellular volume (EV) is increased in the posterior PSM compared to the anterior.
We showed that hyaluronic acid (HA), a naturally occurring polymer composed of repeating disaccharides, is an
important component of the PSM extracellular matrix required for PSM elongation [4]. Together, our results sug-
gest a model whereby FGF promotes cell motility, triggering an HA-dependent increase in EV, generating com-
pression forces extending the embryo posteriorly.
 Here, we will investigate the role of HA in embryonic elongation. We will combine in vivo experiments in
the chicken embryo with in vitro studies in novel human iPS-derived PSM organoids that we recently established
[5]. We will first analyze how HA signals to PSM cells to control their motility in vivo in the chicken embryo. We
will then examine whether this plays a role in the control of the EV. We will also leverage our novel system of
human iPS-derived PSM organoids (called segmentoids), which form elongated structures recapitulating PSM
development [5]. This system offers the possibility to genetically manipulate iPS cells and provides the unprec-
edented opportunity to explore the role of HA in the control of PSM elongation. Finally, we will use a comple-
mentary 3D model of human iPS-derived somites (called somitoids) to probe HA’s role in PSM epithelialization
and somite formation. Our studies will shed light on the process of axis elongation and elucidate the role of HA,
a poorly studied ubiquitous glycosaminoglycan, in this morphogenetic process. This work will be informative
about human malformations associated to defective axis formation, such as caudal agenesis or spina bifida [6]."
10879944,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Hypertension is a prominent public health problem and a major risk factor for other cardiovascular diseases.
Major clinical challenges in the management of hypertension are insufficient blood pressure control and the
recurrence of hypertension after discontinuing medications. Thus, it is important to identify the unknown
mechanisms that drive its pathogenesis. Immune cells, particularly CD8+ T cells (CD8Ts), play a crucial role in
hypertension. Our recent findings revealed inappropriate activation and infiltration of CD8Ts into the kidneys
during the initial elevation of blood pressure, which exacerbated hypertension by enhancing renal salt retention.
However, the underlying mechanisms driving this ""inappropriate CD8T activation in hypertension"" remain unclear,
hindering the development of effective treatment strategies. Our initial studies showed that CD8T activation in
hypertension does not necessitate specific antigens, suggesting an antigen-independent mechanism. Building
on this premise, we hypothesize in this competing renewal application that P2X7-mediated calcium influx
activates CD8Ts during the onset of hypertension, and this event is sustained by an extracellular ATP autocrine
positive feedback loop. Moreover, this process promotes the formation of kidney resident memory CD8Ts
(kidney-CD8Trms), thereby intensifying the progression of hypertension and hypertensive memory of salt
sensitivity. Specifically, Aim 1 will test the mechanism of P2X7-mediated antigen-independent activation of
CD8Ts in hypertension and the critical role of the autocrine positive feedback loop in maintaining this CD8T
activation to become long-lasting. Aim 2 will determine the underlying mechanisms and critical molecular
pathways that mediate the establishment of CD8Trms in the kidney during the development of hypertension.
Proof-of-principle studies in Aim 2 will determine whether kidney-CD8Trms contribute to the memory of salt
sensitivity that underlies the recurrence of hypertension. Our experiments will rely on genetically modified
animals including a knockout of purinergic receptor P2X7, CD8T-specific gene deletion of pannexin 1 (Panx1),
and T cell-specific knockout of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) to implicate these molecules in the activation
and establishment of kidney-CD8Trms that fuel the progression of hypertension and hypertensive memory of
salt sensitivity. Vertical integration of complementary in vitro and in vivo studies are further incorporated into this
proposal to elucidate the important molecular mechanisms that cause T cell activation and homing to the kidney,
thus impairing salt and volume homeostasis to cause hypertension and its recurrence. We propose that salt-
sensitive hypertension is caused and maintained, at least in part, by a resident memory immune disorder in the
kidney. Moreover, the key molecules identified in this study may represent novel targets for future
immunotherapies to mitigate hypertension and its recurrence."

Vocal prosody inflections are essential to function in everyday communication. For example, pitch (F0) – conveys
information about expressing agreement or disagreement, to correct, to signal novel information, or to indicate
between-the-lines meaning. Cochlear implants are notoriously poor at delivering accurate information about a
talker’s voice pitch (Carlyon et al. 2002; Oxenham 2008). Difficulty in perceiving prosodic information is
highlighted by CI patient reports of communication breakdown and listening complaints where the tone or hidden
meaning of a message is misunderstood (Rapport et al. 2020). Predictably, standard speech perception
measures based on intelligibility alone do not explain variability in communication ability or quality of life for
listeners with cochlear implants (Capretta & Moberly 2016; Hinderink et al. 2000; Moberly et al 2018).
Conversely, test batteries that specifically include skills related to vocal prosody are better at predicting quality
of life and communication-related measures among listeners with cochlear implants, underscoring the need for
further understanding of how to assess vocal prosody perception (Luo et al. 2018; Panzeri et al. 2021). To
provide a person with the best ability to function in a social world where perception of a talker’s tone and intention
play a vital role, we must better understand how perception of prosody is affected by the use of a cochlear
implant. The first aim of the proposed work will compare perception of prosodic focus by listeners with normal
hearing and cochlear implants. Importantly, listeners will report prosody perception for whole-sentence stimuli
and provide responses using a multiple sliding-scale interface that will allow for differentiation of stronger and
weaker perceptions of prosody, as well as characterization of errors in prosody perception relative to the talker’s
intended target. The second aim will explore the perceptual weighting of pitch, intensity, and duration cues in
prosody perception for both groups, as well as basic psychophysical measures to determine perceptual access
to prosodic prominence. The third aim will examine the impact of noise on prosodic cue weighting by these two
listener groups. Results from these examinations will show how differences in prosodic cue weighting result in
weaker prosody perception and frequent mistakes for CI listeners, as well as a greater impact of noise on prosody
perception. The long-term goals of this project are to improve our understanding of prosody perception for CI
users. These goals directly address the NIDCD’s priority of increasing our knowledge on communication by
individuals with hearing loss in real world environments. The training program involves extensive instruction in
behavioral measures, acoustic analysis and manipulation, and advanced statistical analysis relevant to the
proposed research. This research will be conducted under the mentorship of leading experts in hearing at an
institution with a strong track record of hearing loss research, a history of training grants, and interdisciplinary
collaboration in clinical sensory science."

Management"" (PRISM) intervention for AYAs with cancer. This novel, brief, evidence-based 1:1 intervention
teaches stress management, goal-setting, meaning making, cognitive-behavioral, and mindfulness strategies. I
and my team have adapted this in-person intervention to a self-guided mHealth intervention, mPRISM. This
mixed-methods proposal has the following 3 complementary aims: (Aim 1) To evaluate the feasibility,
acceptability, and exploratory efficacy of mPRISM for AYAs with cancer in a pilot randomized trial; (Aim 2) To
analyze backend digital usage patterns in order to identify and target aspects of digital engagement associated
with improvement in psychosocial outcomes; and, (Aim 3) To assess barriers and facilitators to the adoption of
mHealth interventions in clinical settings via semi-structured exit interviews with patient and clinic stakeholders.
This proposal has technological, methodological, and dissemination innovations in potential for scale-up of
interventions to overcome structural barriers to psychosocial treatment access. This K08 will provide
opportunities to acquire skills and knowledge in: advanced clinical trials research as PI; mHealth research
including intervention testing, digital analytics, and strategies to optimize engagement and adoption; and
advanced implementation science methods. The research and career development plan, supported by a multi-
disciplinary team of experts (in AYA oncology, implementation science, mHealth and mobile analytics, clinical
trials research, advanced statistics, and qualitative methods) and in a rich academic environment, will support
the PI’s transition to an independent clinical-scientist who possesses the skills and expertise to use cutting-
edge mobile health methods to promote the implementation of evidence-based care for AYA oncology patients.
This proposal will inform the design of the PI’s large-scale multi-site hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of
mPRISM (R01 proposal). Aligned with the NCI’s priorities, this program of research will promote evidence-
based behavioral interventions that improve quality of life, the utilization of portable low-cost technologies to
expand access to care, and implementation science initiatives to bridge the research-practice gap."
10900874,"The environmental sensor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) serves as a ligand for pollutants as well as
for plant, microbial and endogenous compounds. Following AhR ligation, the activated AhR regulates gene
expression through the binding of AhR/ARNT complex to specific DNA motifs known as Dioxin Response
Elements (DREs). Studies from our lab and elsewhere have shown that some AhR ligands have potent
immunosuppressive properties. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from chronic inflammation in the
gastrointestinal tract that affects 1.5 million people in the US. The pathogenesis of IBD involves complex
interactions between gut microbiota, immune response, environmental and dietary factors, and
genetic/epigenetic regulation. Recently, we made an exciting observation that the AhR ligand and plant product,
I3C ameliorates colitis in mice, which was associated with anti-inflammatory effects, regulation of gut dysbiosis,
and enhanced expression of β-defensins (mBD1,2,3) by Colonic Epithelial Cells (CEC). β-defensins constitute
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that resist microbial colonization of epithelial surfaces in the colonic tissue. β-
defensins may also mediate anti-inflammatory effects. In fact, studies have shown defective expression of
intestinal AMPs particularly defensins in IBD patients. We were excited to uncover DREs in the promoters of
mouse β-defensins (mBD1, 2, and 3). In the current study, we will test the central hypothesis that dietary indoles
(I3C) attenuate colitis through AhR activation leading to increased expression of mBDs by CECs via pathways
involving DREs, and/or epigenetic regulation resulting in modulation of microbiota and prevention of epithelial
barrier damage. Furthermore, we propose that mBDs induced by I3C play a critical role in restoring healthy gut
microbiota, preventing intestinal barrier damage and suppressing colonic inflammation through induction of
Tregs. Aim 1 will test the mechanisms of mBD induction by dietary indoles. We will use reporter assay, promoter
bashing and electrophoretic mobility shift assay to determine whether I3C activated AhR directly binds to the
DREs to induce mBDs. We will also determine the effect of I3C on the mBD expression by using AhR cKO mice
with AhR deletion in IEC, ILC3 and Tregs. In Aim 2, we will study epigenetic regulation of β-defensins by dietary
indoles. To that end, we will test whether I3C regulates mBD expression by altering histone modification and
decreasing DNA methylation. We will specifically determine if I3C regulates the SATB1-mediated histone
deacetylation and chromatin remodeling. In Aim 3, we will test whether administration of mBDs offers protection
from colitis by regulating gut dysbiosis, preventing CEC barrier damage, enhancing Treg subsets and decreasing
Th17 subpopulations to attenuate colonic inflammation. Finally, we will use mBD KO mice to test whether mBDs
are required for I3C-mediated protection from colitis. The proposed studies are highly significant because they
will identify novel mechanisms through which dietary indoles suppress colitis by altering the microbiota, through
activation of AhR leading to increased expression of host-derived AMPs, specifically β-defensins."

 Approximately 80% of human cancers are caused by adverse environmental exposures,
unhealthy lifestyles and/or their interactions with host susceptibility factors. Previous studies have
mostly focused on evaluating behavioral risk factors, such as tobacco smoking, physical inactivity,
unhealthy diets and obesity. While more than 80,000 chemicals have been registered by the EPA, very
few of them have been adequately investigated in relation to human cancers in epidemiologic studies.
There are considerable challenges in studying environmental exposures in epidemiologic studies.
Humans are exposed to large numbers of chemical and physical substances and their mixtures,
typically at low levels over extended periods of time. Previous environmental epidemiologic studies
have mostly evaluated exposures one at a time. However, because of a typically weak association of a
given exposure with disease risk, coupled with limited tools and biomarkers for environmental
assessments, most studies have failed to provide convincing evidence to link environmental exposures
to cancer risk. To overcome these challenges, we propose to establish a large cohort study including
~50,000 participants with an extensive collection of survey and geospatial exposure data, as well as
biological and environmental samples, to address critical issues in the environmental etiology of cancer.
Utilizing a framework of community-engagement to help inform research, enhance recruitment and
retention efforts, and disseminate results, we will focus on recruiting low-income and minority
populations who are more likely to live in resource deprived and heavily polluted communities. We
propose to include 1,500 of the study participants in a deep-exposome study to comprehensively
assess the exposome, identify key biomarkers of external exposures, examine associations of external
and internal metrics with cancer-related biological responses, and develop cumulative exposome risk
scores. The proposed study will enable direct evaluation of associations of environmental exposures
with cancer outcomes in the long term, and associations with cancer intermediate biomarkers in the
short term. By integrating environmental exposure data from multiple sources, including personal
exposure assessments and biologic markers of environmental exposure and responses, this proposed
study will allow us to systematically and rigorously investigate environmental exposures in relation to
cancer risk and provide substantial novel data to improve the understanding of both external and
internal exposomes, which will pave the way for future remediation of environmentally induced cancer."

GBM remains the most lethal brain cancer with no effective therapeutics. It has been shown that
the majority of stromal cells in GBM are tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which contribute
to tumor microenvironment heterogeneity and promote GBM progression. We have recently
defined molecular pathways leading to macrophage recruitment and polarization. Our preliminary
data showed that PTEN mutation/deletion in GBM triggers immune response by enhancing
macrophage recruitment through LOX. In addition, we have also identified TBK1 as a key
signaling node regulating macrophage polarization. Aim 1: we will elucidate the mechanism of
LOX mediated macrophage recruitment in GBM; Aim 2: we will determine the molecular basis of
TBK1 mediated macrophage polarization in GBM; Aim 3: we will perform preclinical trials targeting
LOX and TBK1 in combination with standard of care and immune checkpoint blockade to develop
novel therapeutic approach for GBM patients."

Osteoarthritis (OA), the gradual erosion of articular cartilage which covers the ends of bones in diathroidial
joints, is a debilitating disease that affects over 32.5 million U.S. adults. There is no cure for OA, and the two
most common intra-articular treatments, corticosteroids and hyaluronic acid, are for pain relief and increased
joint range of motion. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need for disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) that
would actually inhibit disease progression. Punicalagin (PCG) has been identified as a promising DMOAD
candidate. Our long-term objective is to create a PLGA-based, in situ forming microparticle system capable of
ultralong, intra-articular PCG delivery. We envision semiannual injections that could be given prophylactically
to patients at high risk of developing OA or to slow disease progression in patients with early-stage OA. PCG
is the major polyphenol present in pomegranate. It plays regulatory roles in multiple signaling pathways
involved in the inflammatory process and also inactivates MMP-13, the enzyme primarily responsible for
destruction of cartilage collagen in OA. The approach follows an established workflow for designing an intra-
articular drug delivery system to treat OA, starting with characterization of PCG as a DMOAD, proceeding to
optimization of the delivery system formulation (PCG-containing PLGA solution emulsified into sesame oil),
and then moving to a study of the system’s safety. Specific Aim 1 is to determine the potential for PCG to
inhibit production of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 (important OA cytokines), as well as MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5 (key
catabolic enzymes in OA) by human chondrocytes, synoviocytes, osteoblasts and macrophages. Cultures
stimulated with the alarmin S100A8 to induce inflammation will be treated with PCG and analyzed two days
later using ELISA. Aim 2 is to optimize emulsion formulation with respect to chondrocyte survival, in vitro PCG
release kinetics, and microparticle size. Variables include PLGA MW, PLGA concentration, solvent, and
polymer:oil ratio, which are expected to influence microparticle size and structure, porosity, and the rate of
solvent diffusion. Some microparticles will be formed in dialysis bags and maintained at 37 °C to monitor drug
release. Additional aliquots of emulsion will be used to assess their cytotoxicity to a chondrocyte cell line and
to characterize the size and morphology of microparticles formed upon injection into water. Specific Aim 3 is to
evaluate the potential for the optimal, drug-free microparticle system to stimulate production of inflammatory
mediators in vitro and to be tolerated in vivo within a joint. Biocompatibility of the optimal emulsion will be
evaluated in cultures of human synoviocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and macrophages based on
production of proinflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids quantified using multiplex ELISA and LC-MS/MS.
The safety of the emulsion with respect to the intra-articular route of administration will be tested in a rat model.
The proposed research could reveal intra-articularly injected, PCG-releasing in situ forming microparticles as a
new OA therapy capable of drastically decreasing the rate of cartilage degeneration for months at a time."
10874526,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Ionizing irradiation is commonly used to treat both primary and metastatic brain tumors and can cause a
number of late effects including progressive cognitive dysfunction. These cognitive changes are particularly
severe in individuals who were treated with radiation during childhood. The extent and nature of the resulting
cognitive deficits may be influenced by age, treatment and gender . The neurobiological reason for this difference
is unknown, and very few experimental studies have addressed this issue. Ionizing radiation in rodents has been
consistently shown to activate several neuroinflammatory signaling cascades that can impact multiple neural
processes and synaptic transmission, ultimately disrupting hippocampal function. Neuroinflammation,
characterized by activation of brain resident microglia and recruitment of peripherally derived monocytes
(collectively referred to as `myeloid cells'), has been consistently associated with the loss of cognitive function in
mice after radiation. There are still no treatments for preventing or treating radiation-induced cognitive
dysfunction. Despite the extensive clinical evidence linking fractionated brain irradiation with cognitive deficits,
there are still unanswered gaps in the biologic basis of this observation: the mechanism/s by which activation of
the inflammatory response affect cognitive function, and the effect of age and sex. Furthermore, there are no
pre-clinical models that recapitulate the features of the most common clinical scenario: patients with central
nervous system (CNS) tumors. Our final therapeutic goal is to prevent and treat the cognitive changes observed
after fractionated whole-brain irradiation (fWBI) injury. We hypothesize that changes in the composition and
function of myeloid cells following brain irradiation can both prevent and rescue cognitive deficits
through durable effects on synapses. The translational objective of this proposal is to demonstrate that
resetting the immune system by brief microglia depletion prevents the long-term development of memory deficits
in a brain tumor model designed to mimic conventional treatment paradigms used in clinical settings. The specific
aims in support of our hypothesis are:
1. Establish the effects of fWBI on memory and synaptic composition as a function of age and sex in an
 immunocompetent mouse glioma model.
2. Determine the role of myeloid cells in the development of fWBI-induced memory deficits.
3. Evaluate the role of myeloid cells as a mechanistic driver of the permanent memory deficits after fWBI.
 Very little is known in regard to the evolution of radiation induced pathophysiology in the context of peripherally
derived macrophage accumulation or inflammation, and how this relates to altered synaptic and cognitive
function. Our final therapeutic goal is to modify the cognitive changes observed after radiation injury."
10874529,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Essential tremor affects 0.5-0.9% of the general population and about 4.5% above age 65.
Medications for tremor are re-purposed drugs found empirically, often lack potency, and are often not well
tolerated. In our program we study how drugs that suppress tremor work and through what molecular
targets. Many patients report that cannabidiol suppresses tremor. Cannabidiol is non-psychotropic and
has shown clinical efficacy for epilepsy, but may cause adverse effects, and induces hepatic enzymes.
More effective and well-tolerated medications for tremor, based on cannabidiol’s mechanism, are
desirable.
 To assess tremor in mice, we use the harmaline tremor model, which has many similarities to essential
tremor. Our pilot data indicate that cannabidiol robustly suppresses harmaline-induced tremor, consistent with
clinical observations. Cannabidiol has many actions, but the main receptors activated by it directly or indirectly
are cannabinoid receptors type 1 and 2, the type 1 vanilloid receptor, and the serotonin type 1a receptor. By
co-administering specific receptor antagonists along with cannabidiol, it is possible to determine the
mechanism of action. In pilot experiments we found that activation of vanilloid 1 and serotonin 1a receptors
both mediate cannabidiol's anti-tremor effect. As a vanilloid 1 agonist suppresses tremor, an effect blocked by
a serotonin 1a receptor antagonist, it appears that vanilloid 1 receptor activation by cannabidiol is upstream to
serotonin 1a receptor-mediated tremor suppression. In Aim 1 we will seek to replicate these findings and, also
find out whether mice lacking the serotonin 1a receptor (knockouts) fail to show tremor suppression by
cannabidiol or the vanilloid 1 receptor agonist.
 Much of cannabidiol's mechanism is due to inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase, leading to elevation of
the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide, which then activates several receptors. We found in pilot
experiments that a drug that inhibits this enzyme also suppresses tremor, an effect that requires both vanilloid
1 and serotonin 1a receptor activation. This suggests that inhibitors of fatty acid amide hydrolase could be
used clinically to treat tremor. In Aim 2 we will seek to replicate these findings, using drugs and knockout mice
to explore the role of vanilloid 1 and serotonin1a receptors in tremor suppression through inhibition of this
enzyme and also assess whether anandamide administration suppresses tremor through the same
mechanisms.
 An important potential tremor therapy stemming from cannabidiol's mechanisms is the administration of
drugs that activate serotonin 1a receptors, which generally inhibit neuronal firing. When located on serotonin
cell bodies, serotonin 1a autoreceptor activation reduces cell firing and serotonin release, thereby reducing
activation of excitatory post-synaptic serotonin 2a receptors. Post-synaptic serotonin 1a receptors play a role
in antidepressant and other actions. In pilot studies we found that both autoreceptor- and postsynaptic-
preferring serotonin 1a agonists suppress tremor, while a drug that stimulates both receptors was even more
effective. In Aim 3 we shall replicate these experiments and, also determine whether repeated dosing causes
any of these serotonin agonists to lose their ability to suppress tremor. We will test them in serotonin 1a
knockout mice to confirm that they are in fact suppressing tremor by activating the serotonin 1a receptor.
 This program is expected to lead to the identification of new therapies for essential tremor: inhibitors of
fatty acid amide hydrolase, anandamide-like drugs, and serotonin 1a receptor agonists. These therapies
are anticipated to be potent and well tolerated, should be available soon for clinical trials, and may also be
beneficial for anxiety and depression, conditions that are common in Veterans with essential tremor."
10874754,"The U.S. has set a goal to end the HIV epidemic by the year 2030, which can be achieved but only if targeted
approaches are implemented with at-risk populations to address known barriers of engagement along the HIV
prevention and care continua. Populations of greatest concern include young men who have sex with men
(YMSM), especially YMSM of color, who now account for the vast majority of new HIV infections each year.
Transgender and gender non-conforming/non-binary youth are also at high risk for HIV acquisition, accounting
for an increasing proportion of new infections each year. In 2015, we were awarded a grant from NIDA to
establish a new cohort of 448 African American/Black (AA/B) and Latino YMSM, called the Healthy Young
Men’s (HYM) Cohort. We also received an administrative supplement to collect two waves of data from a
smaller cohort of B/AA and Latinx 108 transgender and gender nonconforming/non-binary youth (TGMY),
called the TRUTH Cohort. Both HYM and TRUTH participants were 16 to 24 years of age at the time of
recruitment. The overarching aim was to conduct longitudinal research focused on these youths’ engagement
in the HIV prevention and care continua in an effort to prevent new HIV infections, reduce transmission, and
reduce HIV/AIDS-related disparities. Mixed methods research is conducted using qualitative interviews, a self-
report survey, drug screening, and testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Biospecimens
(plasma, buffy coat, rectal swabs) are also collected and banked. Analyses performed to date provide clear
evidence that participants in both cohorts are at high risk for HIV, drug use, and mental health/psychiatric
conditions. Intersectional stigma—i.e., experiences of stigma stemming from multiple, intersecting identities1-
5—also appears to discourage AA/B and Latinx YMSM and TGMY from engaging in care and perhaps may
impact their developmental arcs of risk, transmission, and health. Building on this work, we are proposing to
longitudinally: i) examine B/L-YMSM’s engagement in the HIV prevention and care continua, as well as their
developmental transitions and trajectories in drug use, STI/HIV infection, health, and psychiatric/mental health
comorbidities (Aim 1); ii) examine TGMY’s engagement in the HIV prevention and care continua and identify
shared and unique transitions and trajectories with respect to TGMY’s use of drugs, infections with STI/HIV,
health and psychiatric/mental health comorbidities (Aim 2); and iii) serve as a local and national resource for
collaborations and dissemination. We will actively participate in and contribute to the Collaborating Consortium
of Cohorts Producing NIDA Opportunities (C3PNO), the Coordinating Center for NIDA’s U01 cohorts. We will
also partner with key stakeholders (e.g., community organizations, policy makers) and collaborate with
trainees, early career faculty and investigators across the translational spectrum (Aim 3)."
10874568,"Abstract/Project Summary: The purpose of this study is to determine whether breast MRI radiomic features
can be utilized to optimize treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), the earliest form of breast cancer
diagnosed. Although DCIS survival rates approach 100%, there is concern that its management generally
results in overtreatment, exposing many of the 50,000 U.S. women diagnosed each year to unnecessary
anxiety and morbidity. The vast majority of DCIS is detected in asymptomatic women in whom suspicious
calcifications are identified on mammography and characterized using limited tissue histopathology.
Unfortunately, conventional imaging and pathology have not proven reliable for distinguishing low vs. high-risk
DCIS. Specifically, it is unclear at diagnosis which forms of DCIS will upstage to invasive disease or have an
ipsilateral breast recurrence (IBR) after treatment. This limited risk-stratification is due in part to inadequate
sampling of the entire DCIS lesion and an inability to account for peritumoral microenvironment features. This
results in unnecessary surgery, radiation therapy, and medical therapy for as many as half of women
diagnosed with DCIS. Breast MRI is commonly and easily performed, able to best depict DCIS span, and can
assess tumor and peritumoral heterogeneity rooted in biological features such as angiogenesis, making it an
appealing choice for a radiomics assay to improve DCIS risk assessments. The Quantitative Breast Imaging
Lab at the University of Washington has shown that quantitative MRI features are associated with DCIS grade,
a molecular marker of recurrence (Oncotype DX DCIS Score), and IBR. The Computational Biomarker Imaging
Group at the University of Pennsylvania has pioneered breast MRI radiomic phenotyping and shown radiomic
measures of breast cancers correlate with genomic features and recurrence. The Center for Statistical
Sciences at Brown University has expertise with radiomics, machine learning, and statistical analyses for
imaging trials from ECOG-ACRIN. In this collaborative application, we hypothesize that breast MRI radiomic
signatures of DCIS will result in distinct phenotypes that are prognostic and can be integrated with
clinical, molecular, and pathologic markers to optimize DCIS treatment. To test this hypothesis, we will
create a multi-institutional database of over 1400 MRIs, including exams from the ECOG-ACRIN E4112 trial,
with curated outcomes (e.g., upstage to invasion, DCIS Score, and IBR). Leveraging a novel approach to
harmonize multicenter data (nested-Combat radiomic feature standardization), we will discover and validate
MRI radiomic phenotypes and assess those phenotypes’ associations with invasive upstaging, Oncotype DX
DCIS Score, and 5- and 10-year IBR. Finally, we will determine whether integration of these phenotypes into
existing clinical prognostic indices (e.g., Van Nuys Prognostic Index) can provide more precise estimates of
IBR. If successful, this study will help clinicians de-escalate DCIS therapy in low-risk patients and address an
important public health goal: decreasing breast cancer overtreatment."
10874569,"Abstract
Alcohol use is a significant problem among Latinxs because of the disproportionate burden of physical harms
and negative consequences associated with substance use relative to other racial/ethnic groups. Factors
associated with the stress related to being an immigrant increase risk for substance use. A theoretically-based
cultural adaptation of motivational interviewing (CAMI) that specifically integrated discussion of stressors
related to immigration (e.g., discrimination, stigma, social isolation) resulted in significant reductions in harms
related to alcohol for those Latinx heavy drinkers with high discrimination compared to standard MI, and
reduced anxiety and depressive symptoms one year later compared to MI. Rigorous tests that examine
theoretically-informed adaptation of efficacious interventions for addictions are not common, yet are needed to
advance implementation science because they address questions that are the basis for successful
implementation. The proposed Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness-Implementation study is an important next step in
this line of research, which is to investigate the feasibility of implementing the CAMI intervention in a real-world
clinical setting. The key questions are: Would CAMI have positive effects among individuals who use both
drugs and alcohol? How do providers view this intervention? We will collaborate with a primary care center that
serves a mainly Latinx client population to train their Community Wellness Advocates (CWAs) to deliver the
CAMI to patients who are heavy drinkers. We will conduct a concurrent investigation on the process of
implementing the CAMI in primary care - a two-arm randomized clinical effectiveness trial will enroll Latinx
heavy drinkers (18 years or older) in primary care who use alcohol (and may use other drugs) - and follow
them for 12 months after the intervention. Specific Aims are: (1) To examine the impact of CAMI plus an in-
person booster session (vs. assessment only) on outcomes: % heavy drinking days, frequency of alcohol-
related consequences, depressive/anxiety symptoms, and number of illicit drug use days, using a Hybrid Type
1 Effectiveness-Implementation design and (2) To gather indicators of implementation outcome from multiple
stakeholders using a mixed-methods approach. We will follow Curran's framework to evaluate the process of
implementation and Proctor's framework to measure implementation outcomes: acceptability, adoption,
intervention appropriateness, feasibility, overall cost (i.e., CAMI vs. assessment only), and treatment fidelity.
Our study, a first to examine the acceptability of culturally-adapted addiction treatments in primary care
settings, will answer essential questions on implementing evidence-based care for Latinxs that can improve
health disparities related to substance use. Long term goals are to translate our lessons from the proposed
Hybrid study to the broader community to focus on population health for all primary care patients."
10874675,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Race-ethnic disparities in cancer clinical trial enrollment bias research findings, limit generalizability, and
reduce equitable access to the novel therapies and high-quality care that trials provide. Acute myeloid and
lymphoblastic leukemia are aggressive but curable blood cancers that affect 170,000 persons nationally, and
incidence-adjusted trial enrollment of Black and Hispanic adults with these cancers is among the lowest
known—up to 85% less than White patients. These leukemias have a distinct care pattern that limits the utility
of existing, community-based enrollment diversity interventions: patients require rapid inpatient therapy and up
to half are seen at quaternary referral centers, where a significant proportion of disparate enrollment occurs.
Modifiable elements of trial design, low provider empowerment, and patient hesitancy behaviors appear to play
key roles in perpetuating this disparity. Recent policy and data science innovations now allow cancer registry
and electronic health record data integration for enrollment diversity monitoring and intervention development.
The goal of this proposal is to leverage these advances, developing three complementary projects that
together comprise a multilevel intervention for overcoming barriers to diverse enrollment in acute leukemia. In
Aim 1, a preemptive trial protocol review system will be developed to identify acute leukemia trial design
elements associated with enrollment disparities using a predictive risk score and community assessment. In
Aim 2, an enrollment diversity performance feedback interface for acute leukemia providers will be constructed
within the medical record and piloted. In Aim 3, an enrollment peer support mobile application will be
developed and piloted for patients with acute leukemia. Completion of these projects will result in a fully
developed multilevel intervention that has the potential to sustainably diversify acute leukemia trial enrollment
at scale, which will be tested through a large, randomized trial. This work will simultaneously generate
replicable methods for monitoring enrollment diversity and disparities intervention assessment across
institutions and cancer types. This research will be complemented by training that will cultivate expertise in
behavioral intervention development, community-based participatory research, and multilevel health disparity
interventions through formal coursework, workshops, seminars, and a strong team of mentors and
collaborators. The work will take place within a leading cancer center that has a track record of care delivery
innovation and early-career investigator success. Together, this research proposal and training plan target the
primary investigator’s near-term objective of becoming an independent investigator characterizing blood cancer
care delivery inequities and developing interventions to improve access, quality, and outcomes for
marginalized groups. By creating a multilevel intervention that has the potential to improve the safety, efficacy,
quality, generalizability, and community engagement of clinical research for diverse participants, this proposal
also aligns with primary investigator’s long-term career goal of ensuring equity in blood cancer care delivery."

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a debilitating disease with high morbidity, mortality and
health care expenditures. Impaired physical capacity is the primary symptom and a strong determinant of
prognosis and reduced quality of life (QoL). The prevalence of HFpEF is higher in women and increases with
age. Women with HFpEF present with worse exercise intolerance, microvascular dysfunction, and QoL relative
to men. However, older women remain consistently underrepresented in clinical trials. The specific problem is
that very few therapies currently exist to improve functional performance and QoL in patients with HFpEF. For
these reasons, HFpEF is recognized as the single greatest unmet need in cardiovascular medicine today. The
objective of this proposal is to determine, for the first time, the benefits of home-based leg heat therapy (HT) on
exercise tolerance and QoL in older women with HFpEF. This novel approach consists of custom engineered
trousers, instrumented with a network of small flexible tubes connected to a portable water pump. Hot water is
circulated through the tubes, evenly heating the buttocks, thighs and calves. The system is convenient for
application in the home setting without supervision. These customized trousers were demonstrated to be safe,
well-tolerated and to enhance exercise tolerance in elderly individuals with restricted mobility. In a preclinical
model of HFpEF, we recently found that repeated HT enhanced skeletal muscle mass, microvascular function
and treadmill running performance. Building upon our preliminary data, we propose to conduct a randomized,
double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial in 34 older women (≥60 years of age) with HFpEF to establish the
effect of daily, home-based leg HT for 8 weeks on functional capacity and QoL. Patients randomized to the leg
HT group (n=17) will be asked to apply the treatment daily for 90 min using water-circulating trousers perfused
with water heated at 42°C. In the sham group (n=17), water at 33°C will be circulated through the trousers. The
primary outcome is the change in exercise capacity during treadmill tests between baseline and the 8-week
follow-up. Secondary outcomes include changes in perceived QoL and cardiovascular responses to exercise. In
Aim#2, we will determine the tissue-level mechanisms by which HT affects muscle strength and exercise
performance. We will assess skeletal muscle morphology (magnetic resonance imaging), leg strength (isokinetic
dynamometry), microvascular oxygenation and blood flow (near-infrared spectroscopy, Fick equation), and
mitochondrial respiration (31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy). If the conclusions based on our preliminary
data are substantiated, the proposed experiments will provide an evidence-based framework of feasibility and
efficacy of a novel, straightforward approach to improve functional performance and QoL in patients with HFpEF.
Given its accessibility, tolerability and ease of use, HT has the potential for rapid translation and application in
the clinical setting, thereby opening new horizons for the non-invasive management of HFpEF."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing cause of cancer death in the United States. Recent
North American practice guidelines recommend semi-annual HCC surveillance using ultrasound (US) with or
without serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) for cirrhotic and other high-risk patients to permit detection of HCC at an
early stage, enabling effective treatment, and potentially improving survival. However, US suffers from limited
performance in patients with cirrhosis and overweight/obesity, causing the sensitivity of US for early-stage
HCC to be as low as 40%.
 We recently conceived and tested a novel abbreviated magnetic resonance imaging (AMRI) exam
including T1-weighted imaging (T1-w) at the hepatobiliary phase post gadoxetic acid injection (HBP-AMRI)
designed to detect HCC in cirrhotic patients with improved accuracy, with only 2 sequences (T1-w HBP at 20
min post injection and T2-w). Our preliminary data suggest that HBP-AMRI provides >80% sensitivity for HCC
detection. Here, we propose a prospective multicenter (composed of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount
Sinai, University of California, San Diego, University of Wisconsin-Madison and Duke University) study to
assess the performance of HBP-AMRI as a screening modality for early detection of HCC in 820 Americans
with cirrhosis. A complete MRI (which includes dynamic imaging, HBP imaging, and other sequences) will be
disaggregated to reconstruct an HBP-AMRI exam. Using this reconstructed exam, we will test our central
hypothesis that HBP-AMRI is more sensitive and cost-effective than US for HCC detection. We will also assess
the incremental diagnostic value of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and serum AFP.
 Specifically, we aim to determine the: 1) diagnostic performance of HBP-AMRI vs. US for HCC
screening in cirrhotic patients. 2) added value of ctDNA and serum AFP for improving HCC detection by HBP-
AMRI or US in cirrhotic patients, 3) cost-effectiveness of HBP-AMRI versus US for HCC screening in cirrhotic
patients. Finally, we will reconstruct a gadoxetic acid-enhanced (Dyn-AMRI) exam from the complete exam for
exploratory analyses of the diagnostic performance of Dyn-AMRI vs HBP-AMRI and US for HCC screening.
Our long-term objective is to validate an accurate and precise method for improving the screening and
surveillance for HCC in patients with cirrhosis, with potential mortality reduction from HCC. The successful
completion of this proposal will help validate a novel screening method comprising HBP-AMRI, possibly
combined with ctDNA."

Devastating voice loss (dysphonia or aphonia) impacts thousands of individuals in the United
States each year undergoing traumatic or oncologic partial laryngectomies, or suffering muscle
volume loss due to vocal fold paralysis. Voice restoration options for these patients are
suboptimal, and, as a result, most patients are left with permanent voice loss and communication
impairment. This application introduces a novel approach for restoring vocal fold muscle volume
and function after direct vocal fold injury and/or denervation. Results may lead to improved
surgical options for voice restoration in patients who have vocal paralysis and/or have undergone
hemilaryngectomies, cordectomies, or traumatic avulsions. The first goal of this application is to
engineer an autologous muscle-cartilage implant progenitor cell-derived implant (MI) that, after
implantation in an animal model, receives strong innervation and becomes functional when used
to repair a large laryngeal defect. To do this, we will fabricate MIs within a customized collagen
matrix and pre-treat MIs with factors in vitro that induce the MI muscle to express motor
endplates. The MIs will be used to replace a partial laryngectomy defect in a porcine model, and
post-implantation innervation status, based on laryngeal electromyography and quantification of
motor endplates with nerve contact, will be determined. Using this animal implant model,
outcomes with the study MIs will be compared to those of control MIs in environments with and
without recurrent laryngeal nerve integrity. Findings from the proposed studies should overcome
current major hurdles to developing a functional tissue engineered MCC for hemilaryngeal
reconstruction—those hurdles being inadequate cartilaginous support, poor innervation of the
muscle, suboptimal organization of myofibers, and asynchronous firing of the muscle with the
native adductor muscle. Furthermore, because these studies are being done now in a large
animal (porcine) model, with laryngeal size and function very similar to that of humans, findings
will be highly translational. Results from these experiments should lead to landmark clinical
innovations that will be relevant to both voice restoration applications, and muscle repair
concepts globally."
10875331,"Project Summary/Abstract
Treatment of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) is limited to palliative and
cytoreductive agents that mitigate proliferative blood counts and their effects. Small molecule
selective tyrosine kinase (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors were also shown to provide modest patient benefit,
including reduced symptomatology and improved quality of life. Despite the available therapies,
survival remains poor in patients with advanced forms of MPN, and some patients inevitably become
refractory to all available therapies. Consequently, there is an unmet medical need for a new drug
that can safely mitigate MPN symptoms and, ideally, also alter the long-term course of the disease.
To address this important need, we propose to develop and investigate the therapeutic potential of
Aronora’s proprietary drug candidate AB062, a thrombopoietin conjugate antisense oligonucleotide
(THPO-ASO), to be used alone or in addition to other drugs, as a novel therapeutic for chronic
myeloproliferative disorders. Our THPO-ASO inhibits hepatic thrombopoietin gene transcription in
both murine and primate models, reduces serum thrombopoietin (TPO) levels, and results in dose-
dependent reduction of TPO concentration-dependent downstream cellular effects. Work by our co-
investigators and others has shown that TPO deprivation predominantly results in depletion of certain
TPO-dependent mutant JAK2 carrier MPN stem cells while sparing healthy bone marrow progenitors.
Targeting THPO/MPL/JAK2 axis also mitigates the MPN phenotype in murine MPN models, including
reduction in proliferative blood counts and splenomegaly. These observations support our hypothesis
that THPO-ASO could favorably alter the natural trajectory of certain MPNs. Our objective for Phase I
of this SBIR Fast-Track project is to confirm that murine THPO-ASO treatment alone [or in
combination with the JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib,] can improve disease outcomes in a transgenic
murine MPN model. Upon reaching this milestone, we will extend these studies into Phase II by: 1)
evaluating murine THPO-ASO in a murine MPN transplant model that will allow us to assess the
effects of THPO-ASO on the malignant clonal burden, 2) evaluating the reversibility of THPO-ASO
and assess for synergy with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitnib, and 3) screen for and manufacture AB062, a
drug-candidate ASO that targets human THPO. Positive results will justify further commercial
development, and will help support an Investigational New Drug application for evaluating AB062 in
patients with advanced myeloproliferative disorders who are in desperate need of new and innovative
therapies."
10875684,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: SEX & GENDER SCIENTIFIC WORKING GROUP 1
There are notable sex- and gender-specific differences in the manifestations of both treated and untreated HIV-1
infection, but it remains to be unequivocally determined whether these are due to intrinsic differences in
immunological responses, differential susceptibility to the virus, behavioral modulators, effects due to hormonal
differences, or a combination of all these factors. Moreover, although more than 50% of people with HIV are either
cis- or transgender women, their under-enrollment in clinical studies has greatly limited our understanding of sex
and gender differences in HIV acquisition, mechanisms of immunity and latency, responses to antiretroviral drugs,
and behavioral tendencies, such as those driven by the socioeconomic challenges of gender inequity and risk of
violence. Addressing these crucial knowledge gaps on sex and gender differences in HIV will facilitate the
development of targeted strategies for HIV prevention, treatment, and cure, which are imperative to the goal of
globally eradicating HIV infection. The merger of the HIV research communities at CWRU and Pitt in the current
application to form the RUSTBELT CFAR has enabled the Sex & Gender SWG1 to assemble an exceptional
multidisciplinary team of basic, clinical, translational, and behavioral investigators, each of whom has conducted
at least one study on the role of gender or sex in HIV infection or treatment, or have expertise related to the
transgender community. Building on the unique strengths of each institution, the Sex & Gender SWG1 will work
closely with the RUSTBELT CFAR Cores to achieve the following Specific Aims: (1) To engage CFAR members
in research involving sex and gender differences in HIV pathogenesis. (2) To facilitate incorporation of sex and
gender differences in treatment, prevention, and cure-related HIV research. (3) To strategically coordinate a
formal mentorship program to make junior investigators aware of resources to study Sex & Gender. The success
of the Sex & Gender SWG1 will be evaluated based on a well-defined set of key performance metrics. Thus, by
taking advantage of the strong HIV prevention, pathogenesis, and cure research that is ongoing within the
RUSTBELT CFAR and combining it with our experts in behavioral sciences and public health, the Sex & Gender
SWG1 is ideally placed to provide unique insights into the control and management of the national and global
HIV epidemics."

To ensure reproducibility, rigor and harmonization amongst the mouse glioblastoma (GBM) models utilized by
Projects 2, 3 and 4, we have established a mouse GBM model Core that is exclusively utilized for this Program
Project and does not exist within participating Institutions. The Core provides broad centralized access to a
central repository responsible for the maintenance and testing of mouse GBM tumors and professional expertise
related to their stereotactic implantation into mouse brains and the analysis, including imaging of intracranial
GBMs. It also has been providing mouse GBM neoantigen discovery and validation. This would include access
to mouse cell lines and their derivatives critical to the experimental aims. This is more easily accomplished
through the Core and not as easily done through individual (e.g. R01) granting mechanisms or through existing
NIH sponsored service cores at the P01 institutions. This will be accomplished by pursuing two specific aims:
generate and maintain a repository of mouse GBM cells, engineer GBM cells that express transgenes of interest,
and identify and validate mouse GBM neoantigens (Aim 1) and provide the technical expertise and performance
for the stereotactic implantation of mouse GBMs in brains and for their serial imaging (Aim 2). The provision of
these services for 3 of the 4 Projects will reduce expense, will reduce technical and sample bias and will ensure
that the 3 Projects will employ the same well characterized mouse GBM cells that are implanted and imaged by
expert technical personnel."

LMNA-related dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is among the most prevalent forms of inherited heart disease,
characterized by severe systolic dysfunction and ventricular chamber enlargement. Major hallmarks of
LMNADCM also involve features of non-myocyte dysfunction including myocardial fibrosis and endotheliopathy.
However, precise mechanisms of intercellular communication in the heart remain unclear, in part because the
human cardiac secretome to date has been poorly defined. To overcome this challenge, we propose to leverage
human iPSCs, genome-editing technology, and state-of-the-art omics methods to identify and investigate
crosstalk signaling pathways potentially involved in LMNA-DCM pathogenesis. In Aim 1, we will comprehensively
profile the baseline secretomes of each cell type by employing high-throughput aptamer-based proteomics
methods, and perform trans-well co-culture assays to systematically evaluate the downstream functional
consequences of cellular crosstalk. In Aim 2, we will complement these studies with further investigation into
intercellular communication mechanisms in engineered heart tissues (EHTs) of varying LMNA-DCM / control cell
type compositions. The EHTs will be subsequently analyzed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to
predict cell-cell crosstalk modalities and construct a list of unique and shared ligand receptor pairs across
conditions. In Aim 3, we will perform large-scale high-throughput screening of >4,000 compounds using
multicellular iPSC-derived cardiac organoid (iPSC-CO) differentiated from tri-lineage reporter lines. Selected
candidates will be validated and further investigated using proteomics and targeted gain/loss-of function studies.
We anticipate that the successful completion of these studies will lead to new mechanistic insight into DCM
pathogenesis, and help develop novel therapeutic strategies that can impede and reverse aberrant crosstalk
signaling between cardiac cell types in the diseased heart."

 Substantial progress has been made in some areas of patient safety, but medication errors and other
problems continue to harm many thousands of patients each year. In other high-risk industries, voluntary
incident reporting is widely used to improve safety. Incident reporting is also widely used in hospitals, but the
reporting systems do not function optimally. Nurses file most reports, but they experience multiple barriers to
reporting, including uncertainty about what to report, lack of feedback, and doubt about how hospitals will use
the reports. Nurses submit thousands of reports each year, but the reported incidents represent a lower-risk
subset of medical errors, the reports impart few actionable insights, and no standardized procedures exist for
conducting follow-up investigations. The Safety Action Feedback and Engagement (SAFE) Loop has five key
attributes designed to transform hospital incident reporting systems into effective tools for improving patient
safety: obtaining nurses’ input about which medication safety problems to address; focusing on selected high-
priority events; prompting nurses to report high-priority events during a designated period and training them to
write more informative reports; integrating information from reports, investigations, and other internal and
external sources; and providing feedback to nurses on the problems identified and mitigation plans.
 To compare use of the SAFE Loop and an existing incident reporting system, the investigators will
conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial of 20 acute care nursing units at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in
Los Angeles, where 1980 nurses provide over 294,000 patient-days of care per year. Corresponding to three
study Aims, outcome measures include: (1) incident reporting practices (rates at which nurses report high-
priority medication incidents and numbers of contributing factors described per report), (2) nurses’ attitudes
toward incident reporting (AHRQ Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture™, particularly perceptions of
feedback and communication about error and of the frequency with which events are reported), and (3) rates of
high-priority medication events (determined via IHI Trigger Tool method of medical record review). Analyses
will compare changes in outcomes between from before to after implementation in intervention and control
arms. Qualitative interviews of nurses the SAFE Loop arm will provide insight into implementation.
 If effective, the SAFE Loop will have several benefits: increasing nurses’ engagement with reporting,
producing more informative reports, enabling safety leaders to understand problems and design system-based
solutions more effectively and more efficiently, and lowering rates of medication errors. In turn, receiving
feedback about problems and system-based solutions will further improve nurses’ perceptions of reporting. In
addition to the local benefits to hospitals that implement the SAFE Loop, these changes will create secondary
benefits nationally by enhancing the functioning of AHRQ Patient Safety Organizations, which rely on incident
reports as critical sources of insights into safety concerns in hospitals and potential solutions."

physical activity, sleep, tobacco use, alcohol use, ultraviolet exposure, vaccinations, sexual practices, symptom
management, and cancer screening) that impacts cancer-related health and/or outcomes including incidence,
recurrence, co-morbidity, and/or quality of life. BMISR has provided support for more than 25 years to
University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC) investigators with a broad range of service-oriented offerings.
BMISR provides professional consultation on behavioral research design, instrument selection and
administration, analysis, and interpretation of behavioral data, as well as programming support for behavioral
data capture, quality control, management, and output. The service supports the activation of study-specific
multimodal software platforms (e.g., telephone, short messaging service, email) for behavioral intervention
research, including health coaching. In the area of education, BMISR is committed to training research
scientists, personnel, and students at all academic levels in behavioral research methodologies including
undergraduate research assistant and expert training and support for graduate students. In addition, the
BMISR offers training for investigators utilizing BMISR-collected data and equipment. BMISR’s innovative work
includes the development of new instruments, particularly those addressing the cancer burden in UACC’s
Catchment Area, such as food and activity questionnaires for Hispanics and American Indians, and digital
health messaging systems for use in cancer prevention. BMISR supports the development of new or refined
technologies for behavioral measurements and assessment to enhance the scientific rigor of cancer research.
During the current project period, BMISR supported 86 unique users, including 24 UACC Members and 11 PIs

10899991,"Explicitly or implicitly, there are currently three competing models for the role of the neuromodulator acetylcholine
(ACh) in attention. The first asserts that the cholinergic system is spatially imprecise and contributes to a
mechanism for arousal but not attention. The second states that the cholinergic system is spatially imprecise
and is one component of the mechanism for attention. The third states that the cholinergic system is at the center
of the mechanism for attention (implying the system is sufficiently spatially precise to play such a role). In this
study, I will test these three competing models, employing electrochemistry and electrophysiology in the visual
cortex of macaque monkeys performing a cued orientation-change-detection task. If the release of any
neuromodulator is required for the circuit-implementation of attentive effects, the expectation is that the task will
drive release of that molecule into V4, and more specifically that release will occur after presentation of a spatial
cue, and in the vicinity of neurons whose receptive fields (RFs) represent the cued location. The RF of neurons
in visual cortical area V4 will be mapped, then during the task, the cued location will be varied from trial to trial
with respect to this RF location. This will be done, first, at a coarse scale (i.e., attend to the recorded quadrant
or to one of the other three quadrants) and then at a finer scale, attending to different positions along an iso-
eccentricity curve through the RF within the recorded quadrant. Along this iso-eccentricity curve, as the cued
location increasingly overlaps the RF location, the prediction is that there will be a corresponding increase in the
observed effects of attention on spiking activity (e.g., spike rate increases). A custom dual electrochemistry-
electrophysiology recording system will be used to concurrently record both spiking activity and sub-second
changes in local ACh concentration. A measure of the spatial extents of attention-dependent spike rate changes
and attention-dependent ACh release will be derived by plotting these two metrics over stimulus location. These
spatial extent measures (spiking activity changes and ACh concentration changes) will then be compared to rule
in or out each of the three competing models for the role of ACh in attention. In addition to offering the first
rigorous test of the hypothesis that ACh release supports attention, this study will provide the first measurements
of the concentration, timing, and spatial extent of ACh release during an attention task in a primate."
10900146,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) is a devastating disease that develops in 30-40% of individuals
decades after initial infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, resulting in heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, stroke,
pulmonary embolism, and sudden cardiac death. Currently, there is no effective treatment for CCC, there is no
way to predict which patients will go on to develop CCC, and the mechanisms that underly the disease
progression are very poorly understood. A better understanding of CCC pathogenesis is therefore urgently
needed to develop novel treatment strategies and allow for risk stratification of patients in need of personalized
interventions.
A compelling hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis of CCC centers around a hyperinflammatory
immune response that results in excessive cardiac damage over time. This study focuses on investigating how
B cells and their interactions with other cells can potentiate proinflammatory and autoimmune responses to
mediate the cardiac pathology seen in CCC. In the first aim, I will use a combination of high-throughput single-
cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and spatial transcriptomics of human CCC samples to characterize the
immune pathways mediating CCC. Using scRNAseq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a longitudinal
cohort of patients that are known to develop CCC, I will characterize immune cell alterations that precede CCC
at a high resolution, potentially revealing early processes that mediate disease progression. Spatial
transcriptomics will be employed on end-stage human CCC heart tissue to determine the spatial association of
proinflammatory gene expression with regions of cardiac damage. This will help characterize the immune cell
subtypes and pathways that are most likely mediating direct tissue damage in human Chagas disease. Together,
these data will highlight potential therapeutic targets for both early and advanced CCC. The analyses of these
high-throughput sequencing experiments will have a strong focus on evaluating pro-inflammatory immune cells,
including B cells, and their signaling pathways. The second aim of this project seeks to determine whether B cell
depletion can provide a therapeutic benefit in a murine model of CCC. B cells will be depleted in two different
groups: 1) before cardiac manifestations develop, to evaluate the feasibility of immunotherapy for halting disease
progression; and 2) after cardiac manifestations have occurred, to evaluate whether targeted B cell depletion
can provide a therapeutic benefit in the advanced form of the disease.
Overall, the proposed study will transform our understanding of the immunologic mechanisms underlying
CCC pathogenesis. Long term, this work can serve to change the way in which we manage CCC, allowing us to
ultimately treat Chagas disease as an immunologic disorder rather than an infectious one. Long term, this work
will serve to inform strategies for diagnosis, prevention, and management of this important cardiac disease."

Striatal dopamine serves a critical role in motivation, reward learning, and decision making. Aberrations in
dopamine transmission are thought to underlie a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases and substance abuse
disorders. Yet, despite dopamine’s prominent role in behavior and disease, mechanistic understanding of how
transmission occurs at the subcellular level has remained limited due to methodological restrictions. Structural
data shows that dopamine neurons form extensively arborized axons with sparse release sites (varicosities) that
are often unassociated with postsynaptic receptors. Combined with early methods of measuring dopamine, these
findings have led to the belief that dopamine signals primarily through ‘spillover’ transmission, characterized by
slow changes (hundreds of milliseconds or more) in low concentrations of dopamine (<1 µM) over a broad radius
(~10 µm). However, accumulating evidence has recently challenged this notion. Imaging of fluorescent dopamine
sensors has revealed the presence of highly localized dopamine ‘hotspots.’ Further, electrophysiological
recordings show that endogenous dopamine release rapidly modulates postsynaptic targets and is only
precluded by concentrations far higher than those observed in spillover release. These data suggest that
dopamine signaling can also occur through tightly coupled ‘synaptic’ transmission, characterized by rapid
changes (milliseconds) in high concentrations of dopamine (10-100 µM) that are spatially restricted (~ 3 µm).
The stark difference in spatiotemporal structure between spillover and synaptic transmission suggests that these
two modes mediate distinct functions. Yet, little is known about how spillover and synaptic dopamine
transmission are regulated or how these two forms of transmission inform healthy and diseased behaviors.
This study will implement an innovative combination of synaptic electrophysiology and behavioral assays with a
battery of perturbations to dopamine release to determine: (1) whether spillover and synaptic transmission occur
through independent or intertwined mechanisms of release, and (2) whether these two forms of transmission
serve distinct functions in reward behaviors. Together, these experiments will test the hypothesis that synaptic
and spillover dopamine release are two independently regulated forms of transmission with distinct behavioral
functions. By illuminating the microarchitecture of dopamine release, this work will lay a new framework for
understanding how dopamine transmission shapes reward behaviors critical to both health and addiction."

the conference program. This committee provides expertise across a broad area, including fundamental,
translational, and clinical PG research. The meeting will bring together highly regarded scientists performing
impactful PG research and developing new techniques to support proteoglycan research advancement, some
of whom will be attending this meeting for the first time. The invited scientists will present the latest findings in
fundamental PG research addressing biosynthesis, catabolism, and technological advances in the field. A
major focus of this GRC will be presentations highlighting PGs as therapeutic tools and targets. To provide
early-stage investigators an opportunity to highlight their research, the meeting program includes short talks
during each morning oral session and poster sessions each day. Short talks will be selected from abstracts to
be complementary to the theme of the associated oral session. The scientific program aims to present state-of-
the-art science to spark scientific discussions and collaborations, leading to the generation of new ideas,
innovative research projects, and new grant proposals. The organizers have and will continue to pay careful
attention to ensure equal gender representation of speakers and discussion leaders and increase the number
of underrepresented groups in all aspects of the conference. Additionally, a discussion of gender and diversity
issues/impediments in scientific career development will occur in the one-hour session entitled “Power Hour.”
Attendees of this meeting will be selected by invitation or from the applications submitted online, with careful
attention paid to develop a demographically diverse and inclusive meeting. Based on previous attendance to
the PGs GRC, we expect approximately 200 attendees."

The 2022 Gordon Research Conference on Intrinsically Disordered Proteins “The Biophysics and Biology of
Intrinsically Disordered Proteins” will be held June 23-June 28, 2024, in Les Diablerets, Switzerland. Intrinsically
disordered proteins (IDPs), as opposed to intrinsically foldable proteins, do not adopt unique folded structures
but instead exist as ensembles of dynamic and unstructured interconverting conformations. IDPs and ID regions
function through these conformational ensembles and are drivers of biological outputs. The conformations of
IDPs are a direct consequence of their sequences, physicochemical properties, and the environment in which
they reside. IDPs come in many different flavors, exemplified by sequence features such as amino acid
composition and patterning, and they can exist in the context of multi-domain proteins and in different
environmental contexts. Combined, this determines their functions and mechanisms of action in different cells
and organisms. Sequences can also encode material properties that emerge when many molecules come
together in large assemblies, e.g., in biomolecular condensates, and this is important in biological function as
well as for biomaterial science. Understanding how the sequence grammar and the precise context give rise to
conformations and functions, from single molecules to assemblies, on time scales from picoseconds to years, is
important for elucidating how IDPs shape biology and how their dysregulation gives rise to diseases.
Our vision for this meeting is to tackle interdisciplinary questions on IDPs in biological function and disease-
related dysfunction by bringing together biophysicists, polymer physicists, biochemists and cell biologists, and
scientists seeking to therapeutically target IDPs. The GRC and accompanying GRS will be particularly valuable
for entry of young scientists into the field, facilitated through a newly introduced tutorial session. Sessions will
prioritize emerging research focusing on quantitative elucidation of fundamental principles and mechanisms
using biophysical, biochemical, cell biological, computational, and theoretical approaches, showcasing biological
functions of IDPs across the cellular landscape. Key scientific objectives are as follows:
Objective 1. To address how the basic physicochemical properties of IDPs relate to their unique
functional mechanisms.
Objective 2. To discuss dysregulation of IDPs in human diseases and how they may be targeted for
therapeutic intervention.
Objective 3. To address the role of disordered proteins in phase separation that underlies the
formation of cellular biomolecular condensates and disease processes.
We have also identified the following key logistical objective for the conference:
Objective 4. To promote diversity and inclusiveness in the intrinsically disordered protein research
community through invitation of diverse speakers and funding to underrepresented groups."

Among neurological disorders, the fastest growing is now Parkinson's disease (PD), surpassing Alzheimer's dis-
ease. PD manifests as a heterogeneous clinical syndrome and this variability in the clinical phenotype highlights
the need to tailor the type and/or the dosage of treatment to the speciﬁc and changing needs of individuals living
with PD. The main goal of individualized, or precision, medicine is to use patient characteristics to determine
an individualized treatment strategy (ITS) to promote wellness. Due to the complex nature of PD coupled with
phenotypic heterogeneity, formulating successful individualized approaches to medical care is a complex prob-
lem that may beneﬁt from a more data-driven approach. One of the challenges in developing reliable ITSs is
that the analyses require studies with fairly large sample sizes and longitudinal assessment of subjects over a
relatively long period of time. The data set must also include various prescribing patterns to allow the analytic
method to learn the effects of different treatment sequences (strategies). These important requirements preclude
investigators from using data from a single clinical study to construct data-driven ITSs.
Existing guidelines for symptomatic drug therapy for PD can best be described as ""permissive"". The relative
lack of comparative evidence for different classes of drugs has created challenges in devising recommendations
to follow any speciﬁc therapeutic strategy. We ﬁll this important gap by proposing a two phase study. The ﬁrst
phase (R61) focuses on creating a harmonized and curated dataset by integrating data from six clinical trials and
the PPMI observational study that, in aggregate, involved 4,705 patients followed from 23.5 to 96 months. To
the best of our knowledge, such comprehensive data harmonization has not been done before in PD and it can
provide an excellent source of information for future studies as well. In the second phase (R33), we will leverage
the harmonized data set to develop high quality ITSs for PD with respect to several clinical outcomes including
UPDRS score, quality of life, and Schwab and England (SE) ADL measured at 24 and 48 months of follow-up.
Speciﬁcally, the goals of the R33 phase are to (Aim 1) compare commonly used sequences of drug classes for
PD; (Aim 2) identify the best individualized treatment strategies to inform optimal sequences of drug classes for
PD. In pursuit of these aims, we will propose robust, rigorous and computationally efﬁcient statistical machine
learning methods for constructing data-driven optimal ITSs for PD. The proposal expands the scope of existing
methods in developing ITSs by relaxing certain unrealistic assumptions and through the use of ﬂexible modeling
techniques (e.g., machine learning methods) while maintaining valid statistical inference. These new methods
will be integrated into easy-to-use, publicly available software in the R language (Aim 3). This will maximize
the adoption of the proposed methodology by other investigators and allow researchers to analyze other PD
datasets with a goal of constructing an ITS for PD. Furthermore, because the methods are not disease-speciﬁc,
our methods and software will enable similar exploration for other diseases."

Arterial dysfunction is a causal factor in the leading causes of death in the United States. Sex differences in the
presentation, resiliency and risk profile of arterial pathologies are well established, yet knowledge to clarify the
molecular determinants of these differences remain sparse. Aortic aneurysms and dissections exhibit clear and
consistent sex differences in their presentation and treatment outcomes. Women are diagnosed significantly less
frequently and at later ages than males, even in cases of hereditary aneurysm such as Marfan Syndrome (MFS)
where causal mutations are inherited with equal frequency between males and females. When diagnosed,
however, women exhibit poorer outcomes and prognosis relative to men for reasons likely attributable to both
biological and socially driven factors. The biological underpinnings driving resiliency against aortic aneurysms
and dissections in women remain unclear, but their definition will 1) identify protective pathways in females that
could be leveraged to improve disease prevention and management in males and 2) understand the drivers of
reduced resiliency in the females who do exhibit severe disease. In this proposal, we leverage a well-established
mouse model of MFS, gonadectomy and hormone replacement, and cutting-edge proteomics in order to examine
how the female sex hormones estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4) intersect with chromosomally defined sex
to affect well established AoR aneurysm phenotype (Aim 1). We will then combine in vitro experiments in human
iPSC-models of normal and MFS vascular cells with in vivo validation in mice in order to test two specific
hypotheses regarding how E2 and P4 affect known pathways involved in aneurysm pathogenesis; Angiotensin
II (Ang II) signaling (Aim 2) and mechano/matrixsensing imbalance driven by specific integrin heterodimers (Aim
3). Interestingly, while severe of aortic root (AoR) aneurysm and dissection appear biased toward males, non-
atherosclerotic Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) is clearly biased toward females and is a
leading cause of acute coronary syndromes in young women. Among its risk factors are pregnancy and existing
hereditary arteriopathies, such as Marfan Syndrome (MFS). Interestingly, Fibrillin-1 (Fbn1), the gene that causes
MFS, has been identified as a candidate gene among patients with SCAD in recent genome wide association
studies. Key molecular differences between the aortic and coronary arteries may confer critical molecular
variance in response to hormones that results in disparate risk and resiliency due to sex. As an additional
exploratory arm in each of the above Aims, we will investigate whether coronary artery pathology demonstrate
‘mirror image’ risk or resiliency signatures between hormone-altered male and female MFS mice in an effort to
provide some of the first fundamental models for the study of the female-biased condition of SCAD. The insights
gained from our studies will reveal putative risk and resiliency mechanisms that can be leveraged for prevention
and therapeutic strategies applicable to both sexes."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the USA and worldwide. Identification of
genes increasing susceptibility to T2D would substantially improve public health by providing biological and
clinical data about development and treatment of T2D and by advising lifestyle changes in at-risk individuals.
Our overall goal is to identify the functional variants, target genes, and mechanisms responsible for T2D and
diabetes-related quantitative trait (QT) association signals. Previously, we have identified hundreds of novel loci
for T2D and QTs by leading and contributing to genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses and meta-
analyses. To examine loci, we identified candidate genes and developed and applied methods to predict
regulatory variants. We used experimental manipulation, including regulatory variant assays and genome editing,
to identify mechanisms by which variant alleles bind transcriptional regulators and increase or decrease
expression of specific target genes and alter traits such as insulin secretion. In this proposal, we seek to extend
these successes to additional T2D and QT loci. We will study the two key and complementary aspects of T2D
pathogenesis, insulin resistance and insulin secretion, by focusing on association signals that (1) affect gene
regulation in the liver, or (2) act through insulin processing in pancreatic islets. Specifically, we will map liver
transcriptional regulatory elements using chromatin accessibility data in hundreds of samples, identify chromatin
accessibility quantitative trait loci (caQTL), perform multi-omic integration to identify variants and genes that
affect T2D risk and QT variability, and assess the function of variants and genes using high throughput
transcriptional reporter assays, genome editing, and assays of liver gene function. We will identify genetic
variants and target genes that alter insulin processing and secretion by integration of known and new proinsulin
GWAS loci with pancreatic islet multi-omic data, characterize mechanistic pathways, and assess the function of
candidate variants and genes using regulatory assays, genome editing, and assays of insulin and proinsulin
secretion. To accelerate advances in T2D genetics including cross-tissue analyses, we will share data via T2D
web portals. Successful completion of this work will translate T2D association signals into biological insights and
potential therapeutic targets. We will identify risk variants, the mechanisms by which they affect gene function,
and their pathological effects on disease processes, guiding studies that evaluate novel therapies and intervene
in at-risk individuals to prevent disease."
10904016,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 Peroxisomes are ubiquitous organelles that are integrated into essential metabolic functions of eukaryotic
cells such as purine catabolism, bile acid and ether phospholipid synthesis, as well as β- and α- oxidation of very
long chain fatty acids (VLCFA). Deficiencies in peroxisomes have been associated with a variety of disease
states, including inherited neuropathologies, aging, heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Their importance is
further underscored by the occurrence of peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBD); serious early childhood
pathologies that are often fatal and characterized by altered lipid metabolism. Peroxisomes abundance can be
modulated by cellular metabolic demand via de novo synthesis at the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). Conversely,
when they are no longer needed, peroxisomes are degraded via a selective form of autophagy known as
pexophagy. Recent studies have found that peroxisomes and lipid droplets (LDs, lipid rich organelles that
regulate the storage and hydrolysis of neutral lipids such as TAG and sterol esters), arise from the same ER
sub-domains. The Ubiquitin-X domain 8 (UBXD8) is an ER-embedded adaptor to the p97 AAA-ATPase. At the
ER UBXD8 has essential functions in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) as well as fatty acid and sterol
homeostasis. Work from several groups, including our own unpublished studies indicate that UBXD8 regulates
the abundance of LDs.
 In quantitative proteomic studies comparing the proteomes of wildtype and UBXD8 null cells, we find that
loss of UBXD8 decreases the abundance of numerous peroxisomal proteins. Furthermore, from lipidomics
analysis we identified an increase in VLCFAs and a decrease in cholesterol in UBXD8 knockout (KO) compared
to wildtype (WT) cells. Interestingly, it is observed PBD patients accumulate VLCFAs and have consistently
reduced cholesterol plasma levels. I have identified a significant decrease in peroxisome number and an
increase in peroxisome size in UBXD8 KO cells relative to wildtype cells. We were further able to rescue this
aberrant peroxisome phenotype by complementing UBXD8 KO cells with wildtype UBXD8. Additionally,
consistent with our proteomics analyses, we found that loss of UBXD8 in different cells results in significantly
lower levels of several peroxisomal proteins. Although the mechanism by which UBXD8 regulates ERAD is well
understood, its role in peroxisome function is completely unknown. The proposed work will test the
hypothesis that UBXD8 plays a critical role in peroxisome biogenesis at the ER. Proposed experiments
will use advanced microscopy and proteomics techniques to ascertain the role of UBXD8 in peroxisome
homeostasis and examine the effects of UBXD8 KO in a metabolically relevant cell line. A molecular
understanding of the mechanisms and signaling pathways controlling peroxisome abundance may allow for
modulation of peroxisome function during disease states."

Clostridioides difficile is a toxigenic, anaerobic bacterium that is a leading cause of antibiotic associated diarrhea.
Patients with a dysbiotic gut microbiome due to antibiotic therapy, proton pump inhibitors, inflammatory bowel
disease, or hospitalization are particularly susceptible to C. difficile infections. Following colonization, C. difficile
secretes two toxins, TcdA and TcdB, which contribute to disease symptoms by entering and damaging host cells
in the colon. TcdB isotypes from various clinically relevant C. difficile strains exhibit differences in cell tropism
and receptor binding capabilities. Specifically, the TcdB2 isotype produced by the hypervirulent, endemic C.
difficile strain has evolved to rely on chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) as its primary cell surface
receptor. During injury, CSPG4 functions as a potent signaling molecule when cleaved from the cell surface to
promote wound healing. However, since CSPG4 is cleaved from the cell surface, it remains unknown how TcdB2
is internalized by this proteoglycan and whether or not these interactions disrupt CSPG4 function. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to understand how CSPG4 is used by TcdB2 to promote the pathologies
observed during C. difficile disease. Preliminary evidence suggests TcdB2 residues 1769-1787 facilitate
interactions with the chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains of CSPG4 in a divalent cation-dependent fashion to mediate
cell entry. Thus, I hypothesize that TcdB2 interacts with the CS chains of CSPG4 to facilitate cell entry and
interfere with CSPG4 signaling networks known to be critical for wound healing. In this research training plan,
investigations in Aim 1 will determine how interactions between TcdB2 and the CS chains of CSPG4 drive toxin
internalization, while Aim 2 will examine how TcdB2 binding impacts known functions regulated by CSPG4. The
results of these experiments will provide important insight into the mechanism of TcdB2 uptake by the cell surface
proteoglycan CSPG4, and how these interactions contribute to C. difficile disease."

In CTSA 3.0, we will continue our relentless pursuit to transform clinical and translational research in
southeastern Wisconsin and the science of clinical and translational (CT) research. We remain focused on and
committed to expansion of an engaged, knowledgeable, and high performing CT workforce, refinement of
proficient and innovative infrastructure to support CT research and science and removing all impediments to the
performance of research. Our long-standing mission to foster a borderless, collaborative, and synergistic
research and research training environment for our multi-institutional translational workforce, our community
stakeholders and health system members to advance the clinical/translational science research and improve the
health of our community, our nation, and beyond continues to drive our direction. We remain committed to
working within the CTSA consortium to learn from our colleagues across the nation and to contribute to the
growing body of knowledge in the CT field. The tri-lateral mutually learning ecosystem formed by our
workforce, the community, and the health system shapes the framework for strategically moving forward and
has led to the concept developed in this application of integrated clinical and research ensembles (ICREs) in
which patients, clinical investigators, translational researchers, health system representatives, community
members, population ambassadors, basic scientists, clinicians and others are brought together. We will further
expand our outreach into the communities we serve, reaching deeper into underserved communities, and will
incorporate CT research across the life span to pediatric, geriatric and underrepresented populations. In the end,
our goal is to use our hard-earned experience and extended capabilities to address the unmet health needs of
our patients and our community while persevering to advance our infrastructure and workforce development
programs to meet the standards of the developing field of translational science and research."
10874649,"Diet Interventions, by Race, Evaluated as Complementary Treatments for Pain (DIRECTPain)
Project Summary
Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent form of arthritis and a significant cause of disability in the U.S. and
race is a risk factor for poor outcomes. Non-Hispanic Black individuals (NHB) report greater OA-related disability
and pain severity compared to their Non-Hispanic White (NHW) counterparts. These disparities are reinforced
through social and biological mechanisms, ultimately resulting in dramatic racial disparities in pain experience
and associated quality of life. Current national efforts to reduce analgesic utilization highlight the critical need for
safe and effective alternatives for pain relief for underserved/at-risk populations. Low-carbohydrate diets (LCDs)
reduce inflammation and pain independent of weight loss, indicating that diet interventions offer a non-
pharmacological complementary treatment. However, racial differences exist in metabolism that are rarely
addressed in diet interventions. NHBs tend to have low insulin sensitivity and are at greater risk for developing
metabolic disorders, suggesting altered carbohydrate responses. Therefore, a LCD may have greater pain-
reducing effects in NHBs and provide a complementary (or alternative) treatment for pain. Here, we will recruit
male and female NHB (n=100) and NHW (n=100) adults with knee OA to complete our two-phase protocol.
Phase 1 will involve a 3-week diet run-up that will allow for quantification of pain measures, psychosocial
variables (socioeconomic status, nutritional knowledge, proximity to grocery stores, food insecurity), and diet
quality to provide a baseline for comparison. Phase 2 will be a 6-week diet intervention (LCD or USDA diet) in
which both groups will be provided with all meals at the direction of study personnel and input from participants.
Evoked pain, measures of pain disability, severity, catastrophizing, and interference will be assessed every 3
weeks in addition to QOL measures, mood, and depression. Physiological variables will be assessed through
blood draws (inflammatory profile) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans (DXA; body composition,
visceral fat) at the end of Phases 1 and 2. This will be the first study to examine the efficacy of these diets to
reduce knee OA pain with an emphasis on race and interactions with biopsychosocial variables. Changes in all
pain measures following Phase 2 will be assessed with respect to published measures of clinically-meaningful
differences in pain and disability, as well as for statistical significance. The central hypothesis is that the LCD will
improve pain and QOL in participants with knee OA with a greater effect in NHBs than NHWs."
10874650,"The Training Program entitled, “Behavioral Sciences Research in HIV Infection,” associated with the HIV Center
for Clinical and Behavioral Studies in the Columbia University Department of Psychiatry, provides innovative
postdoctoral training in sexuality, gender, and mental health research applied to HIV. Despite significant
biomedical advances in treatment and prevention, sexuality and gender disparities, and mental health problems
continue to play central roles in the continued HIV epidemic. To contribute to ending the epidemic, scholars are
needed who have a fundamental understanding of sexuality and gender as they shape sexual expression and
social life and of mental health as it influences the adoption of preventive behaviors and adherence to medical
care. The Program’s goal is to prepare scholars for independent research careers, in which they will be able to
collaborate across disciplines to address the challenges posed by the evolving HIV epidemic. With its theoretical
rigor, methodological innovation, and practical application, the Program addresses the complex psychological,
social, and public health dilemmas posed by the epidemic and builds upon biomedical developments in HIV
prevention and treatment. The Program employs three complementary and mutually reinforcing learning
strategies: (1) Fellows engage in HIV research mentored by experienced senior investigators; (2) Fellows receive
instruction in substantive issues, including the intersection of sexuality, gender, and mental health, and
fundamentals of medicine, epidemiology, biostatistics, health promotion, and implementation science related to
HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care; and (3) Fellows receive training in critical academic and professional
skills that will enable them to excel as competitive researchers with extramural grant support from NIH or other
funders. In the next five years, we propose to maintain a cohort of seven Fellows, each with a three-year
appointment and with new appointments made as Fellows graduate. Building on almost 30 years of success in
training postdoctoral research Fellows, this Program has and will continue to evolve with systematic input from
current and graduated Fellows, Program Faculty, and HIV Center’s Senior Advisers that leads to ongoing
improvements. Proposed changes in this competing renewal include a Program-specific research grant writing
course, the introduction of mentoring plans to complement the Individual Development Plans, and more intensive
career coaching in the first year of training. As illustrated by the successful careers of many of our graduates,
the Program has had a major impact on HIV/AIDS research and HIV/AIDS-related prevention, treatment and
care. Our Program will continue to be enriched by the numerous educational resources and training opportunities
offered throughout Columbia University, its medical center and school of public health, and New York City. Being
engaged in both the New York State “Ending the Epidemic (ETE)” initiative and the NIH “Ending the HIV
Epidemic: A Plan for America” initiative, the HIV Center, offers optimal opportunities for Fellows to be trained in
opportune, state-of-the-art behavioral research that will help making the promise of ending the epidemic a reality."
10872809,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Healthcare provider burnout is pervasive in oncology, and it imparts harm to providers and patients, increases
healthcare and workforce disparities, and exacerbates projected physician and nursing shortages. Although
burnout is primarily caused by organizational stressors, supportive and cooperative interdisciplinary teams
foster psychological safety and are protective against burnout. For this reason, interventions to improve
burnout require organization-directed approaches that address team dynamics and working environment (as
opposed to only focusing on individual resilience). Although there has been a multitude of small studies
investigating several interventions to prevent burnout, the evidence base remains extremely low due to the
poor quality of data and measurement approaches. As a first step to address the critical and unmet need for
evidence-based, acceptable, and scalable team-based interventions to improve burnout, we developed
Compassion Centered Spiritual Health Team Intervention (CCSH-TI), which includes mindfulness and
compassion-based approaches to bolster compassion for self and others and to improve psychological safety
and team civility. CCSH-TI is delivered by hospital chaplains who comprise a well-established and highly
acceptable non-sectarian clinical service present in nearly two-thirds of all US hospitals and trained to provide
emotional, psychosocial, and spiritual care to a broad range of patients and staff. The current proposal will use
a phase 1 clustered randomized, wait-list controlled, and mixed-method study to (1) examine the feasibility and
acceptability of CCSH-TI and (2) develop and validate a novel, low-burden ambulatory assessment “toolkit” to
improve the measurement of psychological safety and burnout. Employees (n = 80; nurses, advanced practice
providers (APPs), physicians, staff) working at an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center will be
randomized by team to CCSH-TI or wait-list. We will evaluate CCSH-TI feasibility (accrual, retention, CCSH-TI
attendance) and acceptability (satisfaction, credibility, perceived benefit). Focus groups will identify contextual
determinants of feasibility, acceptability, and implementation success. At pre/post-intervention and 12-week
follow-up, we will conduct 3-day ambulatory assessments: (1) Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) of
social connection, incivility, and burnout; and (2) Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR), a method of
periodically and unobtrusively sampling acoustic observations that has been validated and established outside
the healthcare environment. We will develop and validate EAR behavioral codebooks tailored to the healthcare
environment to quantify behavioral indices of psychological safety, incivility, and interprofessional teamwork.
This proposal is an innovative and ‘real world’ approach to increase access, equity, and inclusion of burnout
prevention and mitigation among all healthcare providers and that improves scientific rigor of research on
burnout by developing a novel, objective, low-burden assessment toolkit."
10872874,"Over the past two decades, suicide rates have been rising among school-age Black children (5-11 years old),
despite decreasing rates among white children of the same age. Black school-age children report suicidal
thoughts and behavior (STB) more frequently than their white peers and are twice as likely to die from suicide.
The strongest psychiatric risk factor for STB and suicide among Black school-age children is attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Children with ADHD are predisposed to STB due to impulsivity, emotion
dysregulation, school failure, peer problems, family conflict, and demoralization. Black children may face a
disproportionate impact from ADHD-related risk for STB due to racism. Both structural racism (unequal
systems of opportunity) and interpersonal racism (biased interactions with others) profoundly and negatively
influence child health and may compound the risk for STB among children with ADHD. For example, structural
racism leads to less educational and treatment resources, and interpersonal racism leads to biased disciplinary
and treatment decisions. However, little evidence exists on if and how racism increases risk for STB and which
factors could mitigate risk among school-age Black children with ADHD. Thus, our objective is to understand
how structural, interpersonal, and clinical risk and protective factors intersect to determine risk for future STB in
this population to inform suicide prevention strategies. To achieve our objective, we propose a mixed-methods
prospective cohort study of 320 Black children aged 6-11 years with ADHD assessed every 6 months for 2
years, with a primary outcome of STB reported by child or parent. We have 3 aims: (1) quantitatively examine
the impact of structural and interpersonal racism on the development of suicidal thoughts and behavior (STB)
among school-age Black children with ADHD, statistically controlling for psychiatric comorbidity, using a
Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Analysis (RI-CLPM). We will use the Child Opportunity Index (COI)
based on census tract data as a proxy for access to resources and opportunities shaped by structural racism,
and the Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS) as a parent report of youth discrimination experiences. (2) We
will quantitatively examine the impact of clinical and contextual protective factors (ADHD medication treatment,
school climate, and family relationships) on future STB using RI-CLPM. (3) We will qualitatively identify parent
and child-reported perspectives on and experiences with racism and STB via thematic analysis of semi-
structured interview data (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale semi-structured interviews and separate in-
depth interviews with parents and children). Our overarching hypothesis is that both structural and
interpersonal racism increase risk for development of STB among children with ADHD beyond the risk
conferred by clinical severity, and that protective factors related to medication treatment and social context
may reduce risk for STB in this population. This work will lead to the development of suicide prevention
strategies for a high-risk group of children."
10873401,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This project will significantly advance understanding of the longitudinal links between social
connection, alcohol, cannabis, and other drug (AOD) use through the analysis of novel longitudinal data
that includes a multidimensional assessment of social connection over eight consecutive years. There are
well-established links between isolation, loneliness and all-cause mortality and morbidity, but longitudinal
study of the links between social connection and health behaviors, which may represent a primary
pathway linking to mortality, is relatively sparse due to the lack of longitudinal data. This project will explore
multiple aspects of social connection for adults ages 30-80: social isolation, loneliness, and the relatively
new concept of aloneliness. Isolation is assessed using novel egocentric network data and standard
isolation measures. Loneliness and aloneliness are assessed using validated scales. Mental well-being is
implicated as a mediating link between social connection and health behaviors and is assessed though
depression and anxiety. This study will generate the largest longitudinal data on adult social connection
and AOD use. The fields of substance research and prevention may see substantial benefit from this
project’s use of novel methodological techniques to develop longitudinal models elucidating the ways in
which adult social connection is linked to AOD use.
 Specifically, We will: 1) examine the cumulative, interactive, and reciprocal effects of multiple
dimensions of social connectedness with substance use (accounting for mental well-being), before,
and during peak and during late COVID-19 pandemic, which likely deeply impacted adult social
connection; 2) examine the role of network churn, network structure, and network AOD use on social
connectedness and individual AOD use, as well as predictors of churn and structure, in peak and late
pandemic periods; and 3) will explore potential disparities by age, by gender, and by race/ethnicity in
the associations of SI/L/A, network characteristics, and AOD use, all of which have been
understudied in the social connection literature.
 To do so, we will extend and expand an existing nationally representative sample of 1,771 adults
ages 30-80 (at 2019 baseline), collected by the same team, with four additional annual waves of data,
resulting in 10 waves of data from 2019-2027 for all key measures, and expanded measures 2024-
2027. We will primarily apply innovative multivariate latent growth models with structured residuals
methods, which estimate 2+ latent growth models at the same time while simultaneously estimating
and disentangling between- and within- persons variability over time. Moreover, this model allows for
the estimation of reciprocal relations among outcomes and mediated (indirect) paths, at the within-
persons level; in this case trajectories of AOD use and multiple aspects of social connections."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Patients on the acute care wards who deteriorate and are emergently transferred to the intensive care unit
have poor outcomes. Early identification of subtly worsening patients might allow for earlier clinical action
leading to reduced morbidity and mortality. Advances in bedside continuous predictive analytics monitoring
(i.e. artificial intelligence (AI)-based risk prediction) make a wealth of data available to healthcare providers and
can form the foundation for computational algorithms that integrate real-time bedside monitor physiologic data
to provide early warning of potentially catastrophic physiologic events. The future of acute hospital care
includes monitoring systems that integrate data streams of rapidly changing clinical information to estimate and
communicate risk of imminent events. This will allow a paradigm change in care from reactive to proactive by
predicting patient trajectories and acting early to promote optimal patient trajectories. Predictive analytics
monitoring is a promising technology that will yield families of these new tools. Here, we propose a multi-
disciplinary cluster randomized controlled trial (NCT04359641) to test the use of CoMET (Continuous
Monitoring of Event Trajectories), an AI-based visual analytic that displays risk estimates for multiple adverse
outcomes. It is expected that having access to a visual risk analytic for impending catastrophic outcomes can
draw the clinician’s attention to patients warranting early or extra consideration. Specifically, in our proposed
cluster RCT we will evaluate the impact of predictive analytics monitoring on: (1) improvement in patient
outcomes, (2) response time to proactive clinical action, and (3) costs to the healthcare system. This proposal
is led by an immensely promising interdisciplinary mPI early stage investigators who are members of the
Center for Advanced Medical Analytics. This proposal will strengthen the ability of health care organizations to
evolve as learning health systems that apply bioinformatics data to improve patient outcomes by incorporating
artificial intelligence into knowledge tools that are successfully integrated for use by health care providers and
determine if they improve patient outcomes. We anticipate developing standard processes that can be
leveraged and are scalable for general implementation of predictive analytics monitoring algorithms in real-life

randomized control trial testing effectiveness of our artificial intelligence-based risk analytic."

In response to the National Institutes of Health RFA-DA-22-050, we herein propose a HEAL Data2Action
Research Adoption Support Center (RASC). The main purpose of the RASC is to stem the tide of overdose
death in the US by leading a scientifically-driven support endeavor designed to effectively translate evidence-
based interventions for substance use disorders and pain. Presently, overdose death escalates. Dissemination
and implementation (D&I) science is the methodological bridge to both the scientific and public health gaps.
Yet D&I science is understudied and underutilized in response to the opioid epidemic. Emblematic of
heightened awareness for D&I scientific potential, the HEAL D2A Program will be launched. The program
features 10-12 Innovation Projects, and, in addition to the RASC, two additional centers: Modeling and
Economic Resource Center and Data Infrastructure Support Center. The RASC will optimize and elevate the
D&I capability of the overall HD2A program. In this OVERALL component, we document how the RASC is
organized into four synergistic and dynamic cores: Administrative, Substance Use Implementation Support
Core, Pain Implementation Support Core, and a Research & Evaluation Core. Three overarching specific aims
are strategically ordered across the RASC and all its cores follows: To ASSESS the current state of the HD2A
Innovation Projects on D&I research capability, and develop an empirically-based catalog of evidence-based
and emerging interventions for substance use disorders and pain; to ASSIST on how Innovation Projects can
improve D&I methods and measures through on demand technical assistance and the use of an innovative
Implementation Support Plan, and to develop SUD and Pain Intervention D&I Resource Guides; and lastly, to
ADVANCE the HD2A Innovation Projects toward greater potential for scalability and sustainment. The RASC is
led by 4 MPIs with demonstrated track records of D&I research and practice in the fields of substance use and
pain interventions: McGovern (Stanford), S. Becker (Brown), W. Becker (Yale) and Brown (Northwestern). The
MPIs are joined by complementary expert core co-directors, and have assembled an unmatched roster of
highly-qualified leaders in these fields—carefully selected, organized and ready to provide the necessary
implementation support across the HD2A program. This RASC meets all the specified requirements as
outlined in the RFA. What distinguishes this RASC is our bold ambition to enhance not only the D&I capability
of the HEAL HD2A program, but to influence the field far beyond the confines of the HD2A initiative. We intend
to elevate the D&I paradigm of substance use and pain intervention research, and thereby ensure ubiquitous
and equitable access to proven interventions by the people and communities who need them the most."

 Our research program identifies the systems that support mathematics learning during early childhood
– a foundational issue in the fields of cognitive development and cognitive neuroscience. By using functional
magnetic imaging (fMRI) in longitudinal studies of 4- to 8-year-old children, we will assess, for the first time,
how children’s early neural representations of spatial-numerical concepts relate to their subsequent
mathematical competence in school. We predict that children’s early neural activations predict their growth in
calculation abilities.
 Our proposal examines whether patterns of neural development generalize across children. Some
behavioral evidence suggests that mathematics development in boys and girls is largely similar whereas other
evidence suggests asymmetries. The current proposal will evaluate similarities and differences in the
mathematics development of boys and girls. The reason this is important is because prior research in this area
is extremely limited, prior methods and statistical techniques were flawed, and the prior evidence is mixed. We
will address prior flaws in this research area by using rigorous new statistical methods, and we will investigate
these questions at the neural level which provides new data on patterns of similarity and difference. We then
examine the connection between children’s neural development and behavior, gender socialization, and
learning activities. Based on previous research and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that boys and girls
are largely similar in the cognitive and neural mechanisms, and that gender differences only emerge at later
ages in narrow tasks, depending on children’s experiences.
 Our research brings new theoretical distinctions, innovative methods, and new neural data to a long-
standing behavioral research tradition on the development of mathematics. The hypotheses, experiments, and
analyses that we propose are all well-founded in prior research but also offer novel insights with broad
significance for psychology, neuroscience, and education."
10904902,"Aggressive management of hypertension (HTN) may reduce the incidence of cognitive impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Despite this, 3 out of 4 older adults with HTN fail to reach blood pressure (BP) goals. Multiple barriers conspire against the efforts of patients and their clinicians to optimize BP in older patients. We believe these barriers are largely surmountable by reorganization of the current model of HTN management and leveraging new technology, implementation science, and team-based system-wide processes. Given the high prevalence of HTN, these health system-wide efforts may have a large impact on the prevalence of ADRD. As a potential public health approach to ADRD prevention, we propose a pragmatic-implementation study testing a health-system wide strategy leveraging home BP monitoring and a “virtual” Collaborative Care Clinic (vCCC) deployed in two health systems. We hypothesize this approach will safely and effectively lower BP and slow age-related decline in cognition while reducing cardiovascular risk, mortality, and health care utilization. The study will be structured in two phases. The primary objective of Phase I (R61) is to demonstrate feasibility, assess patient acceptability and satisfaction, and refine processes and procedures to enable high scale delivery of the vCCC at the health system level. We will obtain IRB approval, engage key stakeholders (health system, PCP’s and patients), optimize electronic health record (EHR) processes (alerts and referrals), refine care algorithms and processes, and launch the intervention in 3 primary care clinics. We will enroll n= 60 patients to vCCC for 3 months to assess important implementation outcomes and inform go / no-go decisions. Upon achieving the milestones of Phase I, we will scale the program to meet the Phase II (R31) objective of implementing the intervention across two different health systems (Universities of Kansas and Utah Health Systems) to randomize n=1000 patients to vCCC vs. controls (usual care with education) for 2 years. We will assess effectiveness of vCCC in achieving BP goals (1º) and reducing 2º measures of cognitive decline, major adverse cardiovascular events, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, health care resource utilization, and mortality. We will also assess critical implementation outcomes relevant to wide-scale adoption including feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and intention to adopt. Our multidisciplinary collaborative team and history of collaboration with our health system provides an excellent foundation for this study. We have the necessary expertise in clinical trials for ADRD prevention, HTN management, and EHR focused pragmatic trials at both institutions. With the successful implementation of our BP lowering program across the two health systems, we will be well-positioned to scale the model to multiple health systems for definitive testing on reducing the incidence of ADRD in a much larger cohort."

Hearing depends on stereocilia, which are protrusions on sensory cells in the inner ear that exist as
membrane-enclosed bundles of actin filaments. If stereocilia are malformed during development or improperly
maintained, then people have congenital deafness or progressive hearing loss. The composition of the
stereocilia actin core is well-known and consists of a highly stable bundle of parallel actin filaments which form
a stiff rod. The core dimensions dictate the length and width of stereocilia. The addition or loss of actin from the
distal end of the core drives growth during development and shortening that occurs during some forms of
progressive hearing loss. Our proposed experiments focus on elucidating how actin is regulated at the tips of
developing stereocilia. Similar regulatory mechanisms may repair stereocilia during aging or following noise
damage. Understanding these mechanisms is therefore expected to be essential for understanding many
forms of hearing loss. This proposal builds on work done during the previous granting period, where we
discovered differences in actin turnover at the tips of stereocilia in mechanotransducing rows. We now present
evidence of a novel population of short actin filaments that exist at stereocilia tips but are not part of the actin
core. Experiments in mouse models will document the key characteristics of these tip filaments, how they are
regulated at the tips of mechanotransducing and non-mechanotransducing stereocilia, and how they contribute
to stereocilia development and maintenance."

The pubertal transition (PT) is a critical developmental window characterized by pronounced reproductive
hormone variability, extensive refinement of frontal neural networks, and substantially increased risk for
depression in girls. Rejection sensitivity (RejSen) is a strong proximal risk factor for depression and a
developmentally relevant psychological construct in adolescent girls. Adolescent girls experience stronger
emotional and physiological reactivity to interpersonal stress exposure (IntStressExp), possibly contributing to
their disproportionate risk for affective illness. This sex disparity, first emerging at puberty and continuing
throughout the reproductive lifespan, implicates ovarian hormones (e.g., estradiol, E2) in the vulnerability to
psychopathology. The proposed K01 project will employ a multimodal, dimensional approach to investigating the
pathophysiological role of ovarian hormones in regulating frontal cognitive control, cortisol stress reactivity and
RejSen in PT and post-PT girls. A secondary objective is to define the neurophysiological mechanisms that make
the PT a unique window of vulnerability for psychopathology in adolescent girls. Characterizing endogenous E2
variability during the PT and potential mediators of the E2 pathway to psychopathology represents an
understudied and significant area of research, and is consistent with NIMH’s strategic objective of defining the
trajectory of mental illness. 120 adolescent girls (60 ages 11-14, ≤1 year post-menarche and 60 ages 15-18, >2
years post-menarche) will provide daily salivary E2 measurements and RejSen ratings for 1 month, and
laboratory testing involving cortisol stress reactivity and EEG measures of cognitive control to test the hypothesis
that E2 variability during the PT predicts RejSen as preliminary data has shown (Aim 1), frontal cognitive control
(Aim 2), and cortisol stress reactivity (Aim 3), especially in girls with greater IntStressExp. Mentors were selected
given their documented success and experience as mentors, and expertise in the following areas: reproductive
and stress neuroendocrinology (Susan Girdler, Ph.D., primary mentor), interpersonal stress factors
contributing to female adolescent depression (Mitch Prinstein, Ph.D.), endocrinology of puberty (Ali Calikoglu,
M.D.), and multilevel statistical analyses to investigate state changes in hormones and affective symptoms
(Daniel Bauer, Ph.D.). Career Goal: I am committed to an independently funded research career focused on
investigating ovarian hormone flux in the pathophysiology relevant to the emergence of depression in girls during
the PT. My long-term objective is to construct a comprehensive model of depression susceptibility in peripubertal
girls to inform targeted intervention strategies for the early detection and prevention of depression. Career
Development: The proposed study complements my previous research experience and knowledge with new
technical, professional, and scientific skills in pediatric endocrinology, clinical phenomenology of adolescent
depression and multilevel statistical modeling to develop a unique and competitive research niche."

Spatial navigation and memory are critical aspects of life for animals and humans. To identify how the brain
supports these processes, our experiments examine how specific types of spatial and non-spatial knowledge
are represented by the activity of single neurons and neuronal populations in the human medial temporal lobe.
Previously, we and others showed that spatial knowledge is supported by networks of “place” and “grid cells,”
each of which represent a person’s location in an environment by activating at individual locations and groups
of locations, respectively. Though the human medial temporal lobe is also believed to be critical for memory,
imagination, prediction, and planning, whether and how spatial cell types also support these complex forms of
cognition is unknown. Here we will test the hypothesis that place- and grid-like firing patterns, as well as other
cell types in the hippocampal system, support the neuronal representation of more complex spatial and
non-spatial information beyond the neural coding of location for these diverse, inter-related aspects of human
cognition. We examine this issue by conducting direct recordings of the human hippocampal and entorhinal
network from neurosurgical epilepsy patients performing computerized virtual-reality tasks. In Aim 1 of our
project we will examine whether medial temporal lobe neuronal firing patterns, including place- and grid-like
firing, go beyond encoding spatial information to represent a “cognitive map” of each environment that
represents which sets of locations and paths are connected and how they are rewarded. In Aim 2, we examine
the role of place and grid cells in representing multiscale information, including large-scale geography. In Aim
3, we probe whether the activity of human place cells represent imagined and viewed locations in a manner
similar to the activity present during active navigation. Finally, in Aim 4 we measure human “time cells” and test
whether the activity of time cells in episodic memory are similar to the properties of place and grid cells during
navigation. Our proposed studies are likely to create fundamental insights into the core neuronal responses
and computational mechanisms that underlie both spatial and non-spatial memory and cognition."

Candidate: I am a Fellow in Infectious Diseases at the University of Pennsylvania and a physician-scientist
with a Master of Public Health degree and 5 years of experience working in rural Haiti. While I have a strong
track record of published research at the intersection of poverty, food security, and infectious diseases, my
experiences have motivated me to shift my research in two ways. First, I have developed an interest in
poverty's effects on decision-making, including the theory of poverty's psychological impacts, the empirical
measures of these impacts, and the scientific approaches used to examine the effects of poverty alleviation on
health behaviors and outcomes. Second, I plan to move from observational work towards the design and
execution of hybrid effectiveness-implementation clinical trials of innovative economic interventions to improve
HIV outcomes. Background: Poverty is an important contributor to poor short- and long-term HIV outcomes
for pregnant people with HIV (PrPWH). This problem is particularly salient in Haiti, where 25% of people live in
extreme poverty and only half of PrPWH are retained in care 12 months after starting ART. Recent research in
behavioral economics has shown that poverty can result in worse health outcomes by taxing mental
bandwidth, resulting in a heightened focus on immediate needs and less attention to future-oriented decisions.
Mental bandwidth is likely further taxed by the added burdens of HIV and the perinatal period. Consequently,
anti-poverty interventions targeting PrPWH may be particularly effective at improving health outcomes.
Training: To achieve research independence, I require additional training in 1) behavioral economics and the
decision-making processes underlying health behaviors; 2) the conduct and analysis of qualitative studies; and
3) hybrid effectiveness-implementation clinical trials. Mentors: My training and research plans will be overseen
by Dr. Harsha Thirumurthy, who has extensive mentoring experience and expertise in developing and testing
economic interventions to improve HIV outcomes. Drs. Louise Ivers (research in rural Haiti, qualitative design),
Florence Momplaisir (implementation science, qualitative design, PrPWH), and Heather Schofield (mental
bandwidth measures in poverty) will be additional co-mentors, and Drs. Christophe Millien (PrPWH in Haiti)
and Alisa Stephens-Shield (biostatistics) will be advisors. Research: I will use 3 aims to accomplish my
objective of assessing a key pathway — mental bandwidth — by which poverty (and cash transfers to combat
poverty) can affect health behaviors among PrPWH in rural Haiti: 1) Characterize the relationship between
mental bandwidth, HIV, and the perinatal period; 2) Identify key characteristics of an unconditional cash
transfer intervention for PrPWH; and 3) Conduct a Hybrid Type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial of an
unconditional cash transfer intervention for PrPWH. This research will be conducted at St. Boniface Hospital in
Fond-des-Blancs, Haiti. I will use the findings from this K23 as the basis for an R01 proposal to conduct a
larger trial of an unconditional cash transfer powered for clinical outcomes (e.g., postpartum viral suppression)."

This proposal focuses on the structure and function of nebulin, an unusually large sarcomeric protein that is
expressed in skeletal muscle. The giant size of nebulin has made it challenging to elucidate its functions but its
importance is supported by the many nebulin mutations that cause nemaline myopathy (NEM2), the most
common non-dystrophic congenital myopathy. The protein structure of nebulin consists of a large number of
simple repeats that are actin-binding, most of which are organized into super-repeats (SRs). Approaches to
treat NEM2 are sorely lacking and gaining an in-depth understanding of the many roles of nebulin in muscle
structure and function is essential. We will comprehensively study nebulin, building on major advances that we
and others have made in recent years. To help achieve our goals we utilize mouse models, some of which
mimic severe and others milder NEM2, as powerful tools for our basic science and translational studies. We
will investigate nebulin's functions from the single-molecule to the intact muscle levels, using multidisciplinary
approaches that involve transcriptomics, proteomics, super-resolution imaging, low-angle X-ray diffraction, and
biomechanics. Aim 1 focuses on thin filament length regulation. Our recent work supports that in slow muscle,
nebulin collaborates with leiomodin-2 (Lmod2), with nebulin regulating the length of a proximal thin filament
segment and Lmod2 regulating the length of a distal segment that is nebulin-free. Here we will critically test
this dual length regulation model and study whether it has translational potential, by determining whether
upregulating Lmod2 is an effective treatment for severe nebulin-based nemaline myopathy. Aim 2 studies the
functional significance of weak actin-binding of centrally-located nebulin SRs that bind actin more weakly than
those near the ends of the molecule. This is likely functionally important, considering that a mutation that
increases the binding affinity of a central SR causes a skeletal muscle myopathy in patients world-wide. We
will study mouse models in which centrally located weak-binding SRs have been converted into strong-binding
SRs using mechanical assays and X-ray diffraction on intact muscle. Aim 3 studies the C-terminus of nebulin,
its layout in the Z-disk, and the functions of nebulin's differentially expressed Z-repeats. Many NEM2 patients
have truncating mutations that result in the loss of most of the C-terminus (located within the Z disk), yet few
studies have investigated this region of the molecule. Nebulin's C-terminus contains Z-disk repeats that are
alternatively spliced (expressed at high levels in muscles with wide Z-disks). We will establish the layout of
nebulin in the Z-disk, the location of the Z-repeats, identify protein binding partners, and study the effects of
deleting differentially expressed nebulin Z-repeats on the Z-disk structure and function. Capitalizing on our
>15-year track record of innovative nebulin research, and utilizing our team of experienced scientists and
talented trainees, this proposal sets ambitious goals that are expected to accelerate the understanding of the
biology of nebulin, its role in disease, and to identify possible novel therapeutic avenues."

 The overall objective of this K23 proposal is to support new research training and experience crucial for the
candidate, Howa Yeung, MD MSc, to become an independent, patient-oriented investigator addressing sexual
and gender minority disparities in skin diseases – such as acne in transgender persons. Acne significantly
impairs health-related quality of life and is associated with depression, low self-esteem, and suicidal ideation.
Little is known about the interplay of endogenous and exogenous hormones on acne incidence, severity,
impact, treatment, and experience. Our prior studies noted higher acne prevalence associated with hormone
therapy and identified specific barriers for severe acne treatment in transgender persons. This proposal aims to
examine the epidemiology, impact, and experience of acne in the context of hormone therapy in transgender
persons – a health disparity population with significant knowledge gaps in skin health. The epidemiology of
acne will be examined using data from the existing large-scale, validated, multicenter Study of Transition,
Outcomes and Gender (STRONG). Factors that mediate differences in acne experience, treatment, and
research participation will be newly elicited using mixed methods. Development and pilot testing of a
recruitment protocol and collection of preliminary data on acne outcomes and mental health comorbidity will
help initiate a prospective cohort study of acne in transgender persons receiving hormone therapy. To achieve
these aims, the candidate will require additional training through a combination of formal didactics, practical
research experience, and expert multidisciplinary mentorship. The candidate will build expertise in sexual and
gender minority health and health disparities research, patient-oriented outcomes research in acne, mixed-
methods research techniques, as well as experience in community-engaged research and patient recruitment.
The candidate’s mentored training and research plans will enable him to launch a successful career as an
independent patient-oriented investigator addressing sexual and gender minority disparities in skin diseases –
such as acne in transgender persons. Key results will inform new acne and gender-affirming hormone
treatment paradigms and the design and implementation of future interventions, aimed to reduce the identified
acne disparities, optimize acne clinical outcomes, and to improve patient-centeredness of hormone therapy in
transgender persons."

Interfaces between tissues either transfer load (requiring toughness) or provide a smooth surface
(requiring low friction). Fibrous interfaces are very effective at transferring load between tissues, e.g.,
at connective tissue-bone interfaces (“entheses”), peritoneal-mesentery interfaces, interfaces
between layers of the vasculature, and the pia mater. These interfaces require toughness to resist
high stresses associated with material mismatches. Surgical repair can lead to smooth interfaces
becoming fibrous, (e.g., following hernia surgery) or to tough interfaces becoming weak (e.g.,
following tendon- and ligament-to-bone repair). In older patients with large rotator cuff repairs, for
example, where the desired attachment is not reformed, up to 94% of surgical repairs fail. These
challenges arise in part because the features that endow fibrous interfaces with toughness are not
known. We therefore propose to develop a comprehensive modeling and experimental approach for
studying the factors underlying the transition from tough to weak in a fibrous interface. Our previous
work motivates the hypothesis that disorder is a key toughening feature of fibrous attachments. We
will focus initially on the example of tendon attaching to bone, in which microscale disorder underlies
the ordered macroscale, graded transition between the two tissues, as a foundation for studying the
general problem of adhesion throughout the body. We predict that disorder enhances energy
absorption by distributing failure processes and energy absorption over larger volumes of tissue. We
propose this as a fundamental mechanism by which fibrous interfaces in the body transfer load
effectively. We will test these ideas through two aims: (1) Identify and model the mechanisms of
fibrous attachment toughening ex vivo. We will model and experimentally validate how disorder
across length scales toughens the tendon-to-bone attachment. Hierarchical molecular dynamics-to-
continuum models, enriched by machine learning, will be validated in vitro, in systems with nanoscale
control of mineral distributions, and ex vivo, in tissue samples of fibrous attachments. (2) Identify and
model the loss of fibrous attachment toughness due to pathologic settings in vivo using murine rotator
cuff tendinopathy models. In both aims, nano- through milli-scale characterization will be performed to
define the mechanisms driving mechanical behavior. We will test the hypothesis that pathology-
induced changes at multiple length scales will predict changes in failure mode. These models and
experiments will test the global hypothesis that energy absorption across hierarchies is a fundamental
toughening mechanism by which fibrous interfaces resist injury level loads. Taken together, we
believe that these new models of fibrous attachment will enable an understanding of how the order
and complexity of fibrous attachments leads to effective attachment of tissues."

Obesity is a pervasive public health problem with origins in childhood, and despite advances in treatment for
obesity, primary prevention is essential to prevent morbidity and early death. There is an urgent, unmet need to
predict which infants and young children are at highest risk of obesity. The first years of life provide a promising
sensitive period to address excess, rapid infant weight gain and subsequent obesity and cardiometabolic risk.
Previous work demonstrates associations between risk factors and rapid infant weight gain, but novel growth
characteristics, such as magnitude and timing of infancy BMI peak, may provide better insight into obesity risk
when combined with known risk factors. Primary care visits in the first years of life, with brief and frequent
contact with parents eager for guidance, provide an ideal setting for both risk prediction and interventions. The
overarching hypothesis is that childhood obesity prevention strategies in the clinical settings can be improved
through predictive models and clinical decision support designed to incorporate modifiable risk factors and
infancy growth patterns. The overall objectives of this proposal are to improve clinically-relevant prediction of
childhood obesity and design a clinical decision support tool that incorporates real-time risk prediction. Aim 1
identifies associations between known risk factors during infancy and novel infancy growth patterns. Aim 2
develops, compares, and validates predictive models using novel infant growth characteristics, including
individual and group-based patterns. Aim 3 tests implementation of a risk prediction and clinical decision
support tool within the electronic health record. The outlined research aims and career development plan
provides Charles Wood, MD, MPH the skills to achieve his overall career goal of becoming an independent
investigator focused on obesity prevention in the primary care setting focused on the first years of life. Dr.
Wood’s training plan includes experiential learning and didactic coursework to achieve the following short-term
training goals: 1) master approaches to repeated measures analysis and predictive modelling construction and
validation; 2) execute data linkage and harmonization using electronic health record (EHR) sources; 3) learn
and practice optimal use of EHR data for research; 4) incorporate state-of-the-art approaches to designing
clinical decision support tools; and 5) continue to develop career and professional skills. Dr. Wood will receive
focused mentorship and consultation from a team of experts of pediatric outcomes research (Dr. Smith),
primary care obesity interventions (Dr. Perrin), obesity and population health (Dr. Skinner), epidemiology of
childhood growth (Dr. Woo), repeated measures analysis (Dr. Kuchibhatla), and EHR use for research (Dr.
Goldstein). The rich research environment at Duke University will allow Dr. Wood to fulfill his research and
career development plans and begin to address his long-term goals of comparing risk prediction strategies for
childhood obesity and conducting prospective observational and interventional trials in the primary care setting."

Background Single-cell sequencing data has enormous potential to improve our understanding of
human health, with direct applications in the areas of diagnosis and therapeutic selection. Single-
cell sequencing of mRNA expression levels (scRNA-Seq) initially focused on understanding fun-
damental biological systems at the single-cell level, but there is an increasing emphasis on using
scRNA-Seq to understand the role of single-cell variability on human health outcomes. While the
exploration of single-cell human variability and its relationship to disease is advancing, the cor-
responding statistical methodology to handle this type of data at the human population level lags
behind.
Project Objectives Broadly, the long-term goal of this proposal is a coherent methodological
framework for the analysis of the effect of single-cell variability on patient phenotypes. This pro-
posal considers the setting of population scRNA-Seq studies, where scRNA-Seq data is collected
from many patients representing populations with differing health outcomes. The proposed re-
search consists of the development and evaluation of statistical methodologies for these kinds of
scRNA-Seq population studies. The methodology developed by this proposal will ﬁll a critical gap,
helping to unlock the potential of scRNA-Seq data for improving human health.
Project Methods The proposed research program focuses on three speciﬁc aims that target the
most common analysis needs in scRNA-Seq population studies. Aim 1: Patient-level represen-
tation for scRNA-Seq data. This Aim will develop a summary representation of the scRNA-Seq
proﬁle of a patient and create statistical methods that allow comparisons of this summary proﬁle
between different patient populations. Aim 2: Predicting patient phenotypes based on scRNA-Seq
data. This aim will develop models that can predict health phenotypes based on the scRNA-Seq
measurements on a patient. Aim 3: Identifying cell-level and gene-level biomarkers for patient phe-
notypes. The methods developed in this aim will allow for identifying genes and cell populations
that differ at the single-cell level between patient populations. The biomarkers identiﬁed from these
methods will generate testable hypotheses for future exploration of the mechanistic relationship
between single-cell variability and patient outcome."

Background: Climate change is driving changes in the thermal environment around the world, with especially
strong impacts being felt on tropical islands. The range of temperatures that species can endure (thermal
tolerance) will be a determining factor for persistence in the face of climate change. Animals can also mitigate
the effects of changing environmental conditions by behaviorally preferring suitable refugia (thermal
preference). The genetic determinants of thermal tolerance and how they relate to the genetics of thermal
preference remain largely unknown. With this work, I will work to bridge this gap and enhance understanding of
the basic biology of thermal physiology and behavior.
Significance: The research that I propose will draw upon our lab’s historical datasets of the island’s natural
history and its fly community, coupled with a novel combination of classic physiology and behavior experiments
with cutting-edge genomic approaches in the lab to study how animals respond to a changing world.
Specific aims: In the first aim, I will measure the thermal niches of the São Tomé drosophilids (Drosophila
yakuba, D. santomea, and the continental outgroup D. teissieri) and dissect the genetic basis of thermal
tolerance in sister species of Drosophila. In Aim 2, I will seek the genetic basis of thermal preference among
the São Tomé drosophilids. In Aim 3, I will be positioned to answer the question whether thermal tolerance and
behavior are controlled by similar regions of the genome, and thus evolutionarily linked, by comparing the
genetic basis of thermal traits uncovered in the first two aims.
Methods: I will rear flies in environmental chambers across conditions ranging from 13 to 30°C, which spans
the range of temperatures that flies are exposed to on the island and measure survival and reproductive output as
proxies for thermal tolerance. I will use custom-designed chambers that expose the flies to a thermal gradient.
Flies will be free to move to regions within the gradient that they prefer, and I will track their movement using
video tracking techniques. I will use a genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify regions of the genome
that are associated with thermal tolerance and preference. Finally, I will quantify the amount of polygenic overlap
among the physiological and behavioral traits to test whether thermal physiology and behavior are under
similar genetic control.
Expected outcomes: The work that I am proposing here will provide a novel and comprehensive
understanding of the adaptive mechanisms that allow the São Tomé drosophilids to adapt to changing
environmental conditions, and it will provide valuable baseline analyses for ongoing long-term studies of
drosophilid evolution."

 The gut microbiome is a dense, complex community of microbes associated with maintaining health in
not only the gastrointestinal tract, but also other organs in the human body. Large shifts that disrupt microbial
homeostasis are linked to digestive diseases, but diurnally rhythmic fluctuations in microbial populations are

cues that control intestinal homeostasis to uncover the mechanisms that separate the beneficial and detrimental
effects of microbial flux. These discoveries have the potential to reveal novel targets urgently needed for treating
colitis, a digestive disease for which a cure remains unknown. We performed a time-course transcriptomics
screen and single-cell transcriptomic analyses from mouse colon and identified a new intestinal gene associated
with the secretory epithelial lineage that exhibited both rhythmic and microbiota-dependent expression. Mice
lacking this protein had a thinner mucus layer compared to wild-type mice, and were not only more susceptible
to DSS colitis, but also displayed delayed recovery after DSS cessation. Our preliminary results implicate host
circadian clock and gut microbiome in this phenotype, but specifics of the upstream temporal and microbial
signals that activate this gene, as well its downstream function in mucus production, remain completely unknown.
Therefore, we hypothesize that the host circadian clock and gut microbiome regulates mucus production in the
large intestine through a newly identified temporal and microbially regulated gene to protect the host from
infectious and chemical colitis. To test this hypothesis, two specific aims are proposed. In Aim 1, we will identify
specific microbiota members and metabolites and investigate circadian clock-dependent regulation that activate
mucus production. In Aim 2, we will characterize the function of our novel protein plays in mucus production by
comparing mucus secretion, permeability, and composition in wild-type and knockout mice. Successful
completion of this proposal will identify a previously undefined mucosal protein that integrates temporal and
microbial cues to regulate mucus production and protects the host against chemical and infectious colitis. This
innovative project will additionally expand my training to include key methods and concepts in microbiota,
chronobiology, and mucosal immunology. Altogether, the research and training plan proposed will facilitate a
better understanding of the role the microbiome and circadian clock in modulating host immunity, while preparing
me for a future career as an independent investigator studying the role the circadian clock and microbiome play
in aggravating digestive diseases."

Obesity contributes to heart disease and diabetes, leading to early mortality. Two-thirds of adults in the United
States are overweight, adding to healthcare costs. Yet, energy homeostasis is not fully understood. Recent
research has revealed that primary cilia on neurons in the brain play a crucial role in preventing overeating and
obesity. Primary cilia are solitary, microtubule-based appendages found on most cell types.
 These cilia are critical for specific cell-to-cell communication processes, with Hedgehog (HH) signaling
being one of the best-understood cilia-mediated pathways. HH is essential for tissue patterning during embryonic
development. Interestingly, we discovered that the components of the HH pathway are also present in the adult
hypothalamus, and their activity is influenced by feeding status and body composition. Activation of HH signaling
in specific neurons leads to hyperphagia and obesity. Thus, HH signals are redeployed after embryonic
development and influence adult feeding behavior.
 First, we seek to build on these insights by determining how HH signaling in the adult hypothalamus
controls long-term energy homeostasis. We will identify the sources of HH ligands and the responsive cells within
the adult hypothalamus and test whether HH acts acutely to affect neuronal electrophysiological activity critical
to controlling feeding behavior.
 Second, as HH signals can control the ciliary function of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) during
development, we hypothesize that HH signals also regulate the function of ciliary GPCRs in neurons involved in
adult energy homeostasis. Therefore, we will test whether HH signals control neuronal signaling by MC4R and
MCHR1, two ciliary GPCRs involved in energy homeostasis.
 Both HH signaling and ciliary GPCRs regulate protein kinase A (PKA). Thus, we will also test whether
neurons integrate HH signaling and ciliary GPCR output at the level of PKA. We test these hypotheses using
complementary in vitro and in vivo studies and both genetic and pharmacological approaches. Together, the
experiments involved in this project will reveal how ciliary HH signaling controls adult neuronal activity to regulate
long-term energy homeostasis."

The lymphatic system is a unidirectional vasculature that absorbs interstitial fluid in the lymphatic capillaries to
transfer the lymph fluid through the collecting lymphatic vessels, the lymph nodes, and then back into the blood
circulation. To prevent reflux, the collecting vessels form intraluminal bicuspid valves with an extracellular matrix
(ECM) core in response to oscillatory shear stress generated by lymph flow. Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are
lesions due to inherited or somatic mutations that lead to a defective lymphatic vasculature with the overall
incidence as high as 1:2000 live births. Multiple somatic activating mutations in KRAS have been recently
identified in LM patients who commonly present with lymphedema, chylous ascites, or life-threatening
chylothorax. KRAS mutations are associated with a loss of lymphatic valves in a mouse model of LMs and valve
regression has been proposed to cause chylothorax via retrograde lymph flow into the chest. To further
investigate, we combined the tamoxifen-inducible, lymphatic-specific Flt4CreERT2 with Kras-LSL-G12D mice to
induce restricted expression of KRAS-G12D in postnatal pups. Our preliminary data show that lymphatic vessels
expressing KRAS-G12D are almost devoid of valves compared to controls in multiple tissues. RNA-sequencing
of human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (hdLECs) overexpressing KRAS-G12D or mCherry as a vector
control reveal the upregulation of several components of the plasminogen activator (PA) pathway and matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) that was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Plasmin, the product of the PA pathway, can
activate the same MMPs, which can then cleave the ECM proteins found in the valve leaflet core (e.g. laminin-
a5, collagen, and fibronectin-EIIIA). We hypothesize that hyperactive KRAS signaling increases the expression
of key PA enzymes that then activate several upregulated MMPs that degrade the ECM core of lymphatic valves.
In Aim 1, we will investigate the PA pathway by assessing the expression of key PA enzymes, and by utilizing in
vitro zymography approaches to assess MMP activation. In Aim 2, we will attempt to rescue lymphatic valve
defects by genetically targeting the PA pathway or by pharmacological inhibition of MMPs."

 The immune system is a rapidly evolving defense mechanism against threats both internal: cancer, and
external: viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens. Intraspecific sequence variation in both mice and humans can
dramatically change infection responses, raising the question: What is driving these regulatory changes in
immune responsiveness between individuals? Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic elements that
comprise nearly half of the human and mouse genomes, represent a potent source of inter- and intra-species
genetic diversity, and can act as cis-regulatory elements by regulating nearby genes. However, the full regulatory
contribution of TEs in intraspecific variation within the immune system is understudied. Preliminary analyses in
naïve and activated mouse CD8+ T cells, an immune cell responsible for killing infected or cancerous cells,
highlight TEs as key sources of cis-regulatory activity. In particular, I have predicted regulatory links between
TEs and 1668 genes, of which 178 are differentially expressed across genetically distinct mice strains. Although
these results suggest that TEs contribute a sizable number of intraspecific regulatory interactions in mouse CD8+
T cells, it remains unclear whether TEs provide a similar regulatory contribution in human intraspecific variation
of CD8+ T cell activation.
 I propose an interdisciplinary project that will characterize the intraspecific cis-regulatory impact of TEs
in both human and mouse CD8+ T cells. Specific aim 1 will use scATAC-seq, scRNA-seq, long-read Nanopore
sequencing, and in vitro phenotypic assays on CD8+ T cells from genetically distinct mice lines to validate the
intraspecific regulatory activity of candidate TEs from preliminary analyses. The results of aim 1 will – for the first
time – identify the phenotypic impact of candidate TE enhancers on CD8+ T cell activation in mouse. Specific
aim 2 will utilize publicly available and in-house anonymized human CD8+ T cell genomic data to quantify and
compare the gene targets of TE-derived intraspecific variation to those identified from preliminary data in mouse.
The results of aim 2 will provide – for the first time – a direct characterization of the cis-regulatory activities of
TEs and their contribution to intraspecific variation between human and mouse CD8+ T cell activation.
 I will utilize prior bioinformatics experience in complex single-cell analyses alongside extensive training
in molecular biology to perform the proposed experiments. Further refinement of critical thinking and scientific
communication skills will ensure my development into a well-rounded scientist and facilitate a smooth transition
into a postdoctoral position post-graduation. The Feschotte and Grimson labs, alongside collaborators in the
Rudd lab and Genomics Innovation Hub at Cornell University, have access to considerable experience and
resources that will ensure mastery of these skills. Together, this proposal will further our understanding of how
TEs facilitate the rapid evolution of the immune system within and between human and mouse."

In response to painful cues, protective withdrawal behaviors are triggered to reduce potential bodily insult. These
withdrawal behaviors are vital for survival and highly flexible depending on the ever-changing sensory context.
In pathological states, pain can be induced from otherwise innocuous stimuli like a gentle touch in cases of
allodynia, or one can become hypersensitive to pain in cases of hyperalgesia. How painful stimuli are detected
by primary nociceptors in the skin is well understood, as well as some of the nociceptive processing circuits that
relay this information to the brain. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the flexibility of escape and
withdrawal behaviors are much less understood, especially how these behaviors are altered in pathological
conditions. I propose to study the neural mechanisms that underlie multimodal integration of nociception and
mechanosensation that may allow for flexible escape behavior using Drosophila larvae, as this is the ideal model
organism to investigate this question. Larvae perform stereotyped escape behaviors in response to various
noxious stimuli. An abundance of genetic tools allows us to perform cell-specific and circuit manipulations, and
a synaptic wiring diagram of the larval central nervous system enables anatomical and circuit dissection at
nanometer resolution. We have found that mechanosensory neuron activation sensitizes escape behavior in
larvae and the relative balance of mechanosensory and nociceptive input may bias larvae to exhibit different
escape and mechanosensory behaviors. Here, I aim to 1) test the effect that different properties of
mechanosensory input have on generating flexible escape behavior through optogenetics and behavioral
analysis, and 2) determine the cellular and circuit mechanisms by which mechanosensory and nociceptive input
may be integrated via functional imaging and computational neuron modeling. This proposal will reveal general
principles of how mechanosensory and nociceptive input interact at the cellular and circuit levels to promote
flexible escape behaviors and provide insights for studying pain states and modulation in analogous vertebrate
systems."

 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a deadly cancer with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options.
Biopsies are contraindicated in HCC, restricting our ability to identify unique tumor drivers and subsequent
therapeutic targets. Innovative target identification for HCC treatment is thus a critical research gap.
 Our lab has previously established focal adhesion kinase (FAK) as a driver of HCC, with 16% of HCC
patients presenting with an amplification of the PTK2 gene that encodes FAK. However, the mechanism of FAK
in HCC tumor promotion remains unknown. After treatment with a proteolysis-targeting chimera for FAK in HCC
cell lines, unbiased RNA-sequencing showed that connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was significantly
downregulated following the pharmacological degradation of FAK. CTGF has recently been established as a
tumor promoter across several cancer types, but its role in HCC remains elusive. CTGF is secreted from cells
and can be detected in conditioned media in vitro and serum in vivo.
 Preliminary work in HCC cell lines has confirmed a relationship between FAK expression and CTGF
expression under several different conditions. CTGF expression and secretion is decreased following the
degradation of FAK; CTGF expression and secretion is increased following FAK overexpression; and basal
expression levels of FAK and CTGF show high correlation across a panel of HCC cell lines. Furthermore, the
knockdown of CTGF was found to significantly inhibit cell growth both in vitro and in vivo.
 Given this preliminary data, we hypothesize that FAK promotes CTGF expression, and CTGF in turn
promotes HCC. Furthermore, we hypothesize that serum CTGF levels can be used as a surrogate marker for
FAK expression and/or activity in HCC, indicating the utility of a FAK-targeting treatment in the clinic. We will
address these hypotheses by (1) determining the mechanism through which FAK promotes CTGF expression in
HCC, (2) evaluating the contribution of CTGF to HCC growth, and (3) determining if CTGF serum levels are
correlated to tumor FAK protein and FAK Y397 phosphorylation levels in HCC mouse models and patient
samples. This study will utilize a combination of in vitro and in vivo models as well as patient samples obtained
from clinical collaborators. Overall, this study will characterize a novel tumor-promotion pathway and elucidate a
unique predictive biomarker in HCC."
10902636,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality and is significantly affected by multifactorial
influences including host genetic and epigenetic factors, diet, and microbial composition. One of the most
intriguing interventions for mitigating cancer risk and progression is modifying dietary behavior, a powerful
approach that has been increasingly investigated. While many studies focus on individual dietary components,
it is unclear how distinct metabolic inputs from the dietary milieu integrate to influence cancer
progression. Two major nutrients that have been extensively linked to CRC are fructose and fiber.
Fructose is highly enriched in Western diets and promotes intestinal tumorigenesis by accelerating de novo
lipogenesis (DNL) and glycolysis. Fiber is metabolized by the gut microbiota to produce short-chain fatty acids
(SCFAs), which exert anticarcinogenic activity. Fructose and acetate, the most abundant SCFA, converge
at a common downstream metabolite, acetyl-CoA, which can be used for DNL or histone modification, making
it a central metabolite critical to metabolism and epigenetic regulation. This makes fructose and acetate prime
candidates for evaluating crosstalk between multiple dietary inputs in CRC. ACSS2 is the enzyme responsible
for converting acetate to acetyl-CoA and is a gene target of several transcription factors which are
activated in response to fructose consumption. Thus, ACSS2 is important due to its position at the nexus of
catabolic and anabolic metabolism. A key focus of this proposal is on the metabolic and epigenetic effects of
dietary fiber and fructose and the role of ACSS2 in mediating these effects. My preliminary data suggest that
loss of ACSS2 expression is associated with greater CRC tumor grade and progression. This is potentially due
to the downregulation of cell differentiation genes and upregulation of genes relevant to CRC tumor metastasis,
such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Using a mouse model, we found that manipulating dietary fiber and
fructose led to changes to host metabolism in opposing directions, highlighting the need for understanding the
integrated effects of these particular nutrients in the cancer context. I hypothesize that fructose manipulates
acetyl-CoA pool utilization to prioritize biosynthetic pathways that are advantageous for tumor growth
and that acetate exerts epigenetic effects on colonic differentiation gene targets, which are mediated by
ACSS2-directed histone acetylation. Aim 1 will determine how acetate and fructose interact to affect CRC
growth and acetyl-CoA metabolism through in vitro organoid and cell culture models and in vivo genetic mouse
models. Aim 2 will identify the mechanism by which acetate, fructose, and ACSS2 regulate CRC epigenetic
modifications and differentiation status through histone proteomics, RNA sequencing, and chromatin
immunoprecipitation sequencing. This project will provide novel insights into the combinatorial effects of fiber
and fructose and the influence of host gene-diet interactions on susceptibility to dietary impacts on CRC. Our
work has significant implications for dietary interventions that can profoundly impact cancer patient care."

In low- and middle-income countries ~2.8 billion people are exposed daily to smoke from cooking fires, termed
household air pollution (HAP), resulting in an estimated 2.3M deaths and 91.4M DALYs in 2019. The largest
proportion of HAP-attributable deaths are due to cardiovascular disease. Establishment of cardiovascular
health in childhood is critical to reduce risk for future cardiovascular disease. We hypothesize that early life
(prenatal to age 1) exposure to HAP alters cardiovascular development and programs future disease risk. We
further hypothesize that the metal composition of air pollution drives toxicity. We propose to build on an
existing pregnancy cohort in Ghana – the Ghana Randomized Air Pollution and Health Study, or GRAPHS – to
assess how early life air pollution exposure and metals exposures affect cardiovascular health through age 12
years. We will use well-established, validated methods to assess these outcomes. In the long run, our research
will help build the evidence base for cost effective interventions to improve health by reducing HAP exposure."

Refractive errors are a major cause of vision loss worldwide, and the rising prevalence of myopia and
associated blinding conditions is a significant public health concern. Regulation of ocular axial growth is critical
for normal refractive development to ensure that a focused image falls directly on the retina. Our goal is to
decode the molecular and genetic program that governs ocular axial growth. Ocular growth is driven by an
intrinsic, genetic process during prenatal and postnatal development (vision-unadjusted) and by a postnatal,
vision-guided process, emmetropization, thought to interact with intrinsic ocular growth such that the eye's
axial length matches its optical power. Enhanced intrinsic ocular growth and defective emmetropization are
thought to cause a mismatch between ocular axial length and optical power, leading to myopia. Ocular axial
growth relies on signals from the retina to the sclera to promote extracellular matrix remodeling and ocular
elongation. However, the mechanisms by which the signals translate to ocular axial growth remain elusive. Our
studies suggest that PRSS56, a secreted serine protease, is a component of the intrinsic machinery that
supports ocular axial growth. However, it is not known whether Prss56 has a direct role in emmetropization.
We propose to uncover the molecular and cellular processes underlying PRSS56-dependent refractive
development and associated errors and assess the role of PRSS56 in vision-guided ocular growth.
Despite evidence that altered expression of PRSS56 affects ocular axial length, the factors that regulate its
expression and mediate its effect are not known. The Wnt-mediated pathway is associated with myopia
pathogenesis, and we have found that Prss56 responds to Wnt signaling agonists. In Aim 1, we will elucidate
the link between Wnt and Prss56 by modulating WNT activity in genetic mouse models and studying the effect
on the retinal expression of PRSS56 and ocular growth (Aim 1.1). We will also determine, in conditional mouse
models, whether retinal pigment epithelium–localized Serpine3—which we identified as a candidate mediator
of PRSS56-dependent growth—helps relay PRSS56-dependent signals that support ocular growth (Aim 1.2).
In Aim 2, we will characterize the function of PRSS56 to guide the identification of its substrate(s) and targeted
therapies. In Aim 3, we will test the role of PRSS56 in emmetropization and PRSS56-dependent regulation of
ocular axial growth by temporarily inactivating PRSS56 in conditional mutant mice and using experimental
paradigms that induce axial elongation in response to visual blur or optical defocus.
The proposed studies will provide a molecular and genetic framework to understand the mechanisms of ocular
growth and guide us to potential therapeutic targets to manage myopia."

 In the United States, trauma is the leading cause of death for individuals under the age of 45 and was
responsible for $671 billion in economic damage in 2013. Despite growing standardization of clinical trauma
care, at Level I and Level II trauma centers, there remains significant variability in patient outcomes across
trauma centers on both levels. To resolve this issue, two knowledge gaps will be addressed: a) which
organizational features impact patient outcomes and b) which organizational features are indicative of
institutional commitment. Our global hypothesis is that variability of organizational features in Level I and Level
II trauma centers is a significant factor in the variability of patient outcomes across those trauma centers. We will
also collect data on which organizational features are indicative of institutional commitment from the perspective
of trauma experts.
 In Aim 1 we will collect data about the organizational characteristics and patient outcomes at 230 Level I
and Level 2 trauma centers. These centers will also provide us with their Trauma Quality Improvement Program
data, which includes patient outcomes. To support our global hypothesis, we will use these data to test whether
organizational features of the trauma centers show an impact on patient outcomes, specifically patient mortality,
length of stay, and risk-adjusted major complications.
 In Aim 2 we will use the data about organizational characteristics to assess which organizational features
of trauma centers are indicative of institutional commitment using Latent Class analysis. This will allow us to
represent the dependencies between organizational features and institutional commitment and add this
information to the TIPTOE database. We will use these data to create automatic inferences on patterns of
institutional commitment to represent, group and analyze factors indicative of institutional commitment using data
collected in the present project. This provides an additional source of knowledge guiding trauma center planning
and decision-making.
 In Aim 3 we will extend the Ontology of Organizational Structures of Trauma Centers and Trauma
Systems (OOSTT) to include institutional commitment and patient outcomes. We will set up the TIPTOE
Knowledge Base and create the Knowledge Path tool for users to explore, analyze, and visualize TIPTOE data.
We will test the hypothesis that the TIPTOE Knowledge Path is perceived to make a positive impact on
knowledge discovery and decision making in the user community.
 This project will initialize a novel resource of patient outcome information for the trauma care community.
The purpose of this project is the next evolution of trauma center quality improvement allowing change based
on scientific evidence of which components of trauma centers affect patient outcomes."
10902328,"Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a major public health concern, accounting for up to 400,000 deaths each year.
While SCA cases are heterogeneous in etiology, the most common underlying pathologic substrate is ischemic
heart disease and the most common electrophysiologic mechanism is ventricular fibrillation (VF). Survival
following VF-SCA is less than 20% in most communities with mortality due largely to fulminant injury of either
the heart or brain. Accordingly, there is a compelling case to identify novel modifiable SCA risk factors, to
elucidate its underlying pathophysiology, and to identify novel preventative and therapeutic targets. The
mitochondrion has primary function in energetics, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, and serves as both a target
and an effector of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Consequently, mitochondria have a fundamental role in
arrhythmia risk and in cardiac and brain resuscitation. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number (-CN), which reflects the number of MT genomes per cell, is a novel
risk factor for SCA, independent of traditional SCA risk factors. MtDNA-CN, however, captures the quantity of
mitochondria. It does not capture their quality. We have recently identified a series of mtDNA haplotypes that
capture functional genetic variation, and developed a computational tool to accurately assess somatic mutations
in mitochondria (heteroplasmy), allowing for a comprehensive survey of mtDNA genetic variation. Thus, we
propose to test the hypothesis that mtDNA variation (mtDNA-CN, inherited mtDNA haplotypes and rare
mutations, mtDNA heteroplasmy [somatic variants]) will be associated with SCA risk and resuscitation outcomes.
We will examine the association of SCA with mtDNA characteristics in 2,600 SCA cases from a large population-
based case-control study of SCA and validate our findings in two population-based cohort studies where SCA
cases have been identified prospectively and two case-control studies of autopsy confirmed SCA subjects. We
will also examine the association of mtDNA variation with cardiac resuscitation (restoration of sustained
circulation) and brain recovery among 2,600 VF-SCA cases followed prospectively. Second, we will characterize
the consequences of specific mtDNA variation on mitochondrial function and cardiomyocyte (CM) electrical
activity. We will assess the impact of mtDNA variants associated with known rare diseases with CM involvement
across a range of heteroplasmies using human induced pluripotent stem cell CMs (hiPSC-CMs) to directly test
whether deleterious heteroplasmic variants modify electrical excitability, repolarization or conduction, or
compromise the development or maturation of CMs. We will also leverage existing mtDNA base editing
technologies to assess the impact of variants associated with SCA risk and/or resuscitation outcomes. Together,
these aims will determine whether mtDNA genetic variation are associated with SCA risk and resuscitation and
will characterize the consequences of mtDNA variation on CM electrical activity. These investigations will lead
to innovative approaches to prevent SCA and improve VF-SCA resuscitation outcomes."

It is well established that drug-induced alterations to gene expression contribute to the development of drug-
seeking behaviors. For instance, both acute and chronic exposure to cocaine increases histone acetylation within
and significantly alters transcriptional profiles within the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Our lab has demonstrated
that HDAC3, a histone deacetylase enzyme, within the NAc negatively regulates cocaine-induced changes in
histone acetylation, gene expression, and memory formation. However, it is unknown whether cocaine alters
HDAC3-mediated transcriptional changes underlying reward-associated behavior in a sex-dependent manner.
In a recent study, our lab identified Gilz (glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper) as an HDAC3 target gene that
may be critical for memory formation. Gilz is an X-chromosome linked gene which may provide novel insight into
sex-differences observed in response to cocaine exposure. I have collected preliminary data suggesting Gilz
positively regulates reinstatement of previously extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior, perhaps through
transcription-dependent mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. However, the precise role of Gilz in reinstatement
remains unknown, as does whether these observations are consistent across both sexes. The experiments
proposed in this application will allow me to test the overall hypothesis that Gilz acts in the NAc to regulate
transcription underlying cellular and behavioral responses to cocaine."

The long-term goal of this project is to improve the health and well-being of preterm infants and their parents.
Very preterm infants necessitate medical care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at birth and can be
hospitalized for their first several months of life, where they are exposed to repetitive, painful stimuli, are
separated from their parents, and often do not receive positive, timed sensory exposures that are similar to
what they would have received if not born early. In addition, parents often do not know when and how to
engage with their infant in the NICU. However, early positive sensory experiences are important, as they
enhance brain development during an important period of time and can be used as a tool to help parents
participate during NICU hospitalization and establish early parent-child relationships to optimize development.
Although there is evidence to support positive multisensory interventions in the NICU, these interventions are
often applied in an inconsistent manner, reducing their benefit. Through a rigorous and scientific process, we
have developed a structured multisensory intervention program, titled Supporting and Enhancing NICU
Sensory Experiences (SENSE), which includes specific doses and targeted timing of evidence-based
interventions such as massage, auditory exposure, rocking, holding, and skin-to-skin care. The interventions
are based on the infant’s developmental stage and are adapted based on the infant’s medical status and
behavioral cues. The multisensory interventions are designed to be conducted during each day of NICU
hospitalization by the parents, who are educated and supported to provide them. A sensory support team fills
in gaps when parents are unable to reach the targeted amount of sensory exposures each day. The proposed
work aims to determine the effect of multisensory interventions on parent mental health, parent-child
interaction, brain activity (amplitude integrated electroencephalography), and infant developmental outcomes
through age 2 years, with specific attention to language outcome. Two-hundred fifteen parent-infant dyads of
preterm infants born ≤ 32 weeks gestation and admitted to a Level IV NICU will be enrolled within 1 week of
birth. Infants will be randomized to either the SENSE multisensory program or to the standard of care during
the NICU stay. The SENSE program combines structured, easy-to-conduct, multisensory interventions with
parent engagement to optimize outcomes in the complex medical environment of the NICU. Standardized
assessments of parent mental health, infant neurodevelopment, and parent-child interaction will be conducted
prior to NICU discharge and at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, adjusted for prematurity. Differences between
groups will be investigated. Brain activity during NICU stay, including in the presence and absence of different
sensory exposures, will also be investigated. The expected outcome is that the SENSE multisensory program
will have a positive effect on improving outcomes. Importantly, the SENSE program has been implemented
with ease in >250 hospitals in the US and abroad, so there is great potential for broad and long-term impact."

Unhealthy alcohol use is common among men who have sex with men (MSM). Unhealthy alcohol use is a
spectrum from risky/hazardous drinking to alcohol use disorder. For MSM, unhealthy alcohol use may reduce
PrEP persistence and adherence, which are critical for HIV prevention. Reducing unhealthy alcohol use may
improve PrEP outcomes. The brief alcohol intervention (BAI), which draws on Motivational Interviewing and
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, increases viral suppression among people living with HIV on antiretroviral
therapy. This effect is mediated through increased adherence. The BAI may have a similar effect on PrEP
outcomes among MSM with unhealthy alcohol use. We propose an effectiveness-implementation type 1 hybrid
randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the BAI to standard of care among MSM with unhealthy alcohol
use initiating or re-initiating PrEP in Vietnam. We hypothesize that the BAI will improve a) PrEP persistence, b)
PrEP adherence, and c) risk-aligned PrEP use (PrEP use consistent with current risk, including event-driven
PrEP). Our specific aims are to: 1) Assess effectiveness of the BAI for increasing PrEP persistence and
adherence among MSM in Vietnam; 2) Assess the impact of the BAI on alcohol use among MSM; 3) Estimate
the cost-effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of scaling up the BAI in PrEP clinics throughout Vietnam.
The trial and intervention will be conducted at the Hanoi Medical University PrEP clinic for MSM Vietnam.
Evaluation visits will be conducted at UNC Project-Vietnam. Eligible participants will include MSM (n=506)
presenting to the PrEP clinic for PrEP initiation or re-initiation after 6 months without PrEP. The participants
must also screen positive for unhealthy alcohol use with an AUDIT-C score ≥ 4. After baseline evaluations,
participants will be randomized to either standard of care or the BAI, which comprises two in-person and two
telephone visits. Each participant will be followed quarterly with interviews, including use of timeline followback
to elicit PrEP use, alcohol use, and sexual behavior, and tests for HIV infection, gonorrhea, chlamydial
infection, and syphilis. Alcohol use and PrEP adherence will also be assessed with biomarkers. The primary
effectiveness outcome is PrEP persistence at 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes include PrEP adherence,
assessed by self-report, pharmacy records, and validated bioassays; risk-aligned PrEP use; and alcohol
outcomes (heavy drinking days (binge drinking), defined as the number of days with ≥5 drinks per occasion;
number of drinking days; and drinks per drinking day; and phosphatidylethanol level). The primary
implementation outcomes are the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, expressed as the incremental cost per
quality-adjusted life-year gained, and feasibility and acceptability. If successful, this study will be set to ensure
rapid scale up of an intervention to improve the lives of MSM by reducing unhealthy alcohol use and increasing
PrEP use for HIV prevention."

10898262,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Otitis media with effusion (OME) is a common childhood condition characterized by a non-purulent effusion
in the middle-ear space. OME can cause conductive hearing loss (CHL), but hearing status varies substantially
from normal hearing to moderate hearing losses (0-55 dB HL), and episodes of OME can last for variable lengths
of time. Clinical equipoise exists as to whether to treat OME (i.e., surgical tube placement) or wait for it to resolve
spontaneously. While there are risks associated with surgery in young children, waiting for OME to resolve
spontaneously may also carry risks. OME has been associated with long-term deficits in speech, language, and
auditory processing. However, findings from clinical studies are variable, resulting in a persistent debate
regarding the long-term sequelae of OME. We hypothesize that a key risk factor for long-term deficits is the
cumulative auditory deprivation associated with OME-related CHL, not by the presence of OME itself. If this is
the case, only a subset of children with OME (those with notable hearing losses) would be at risk of long-term
deficits. As such, it is critical that we determine the hearing status of all children with OME as well as understand
the variability in the effects of this hearing loss on long-term outcomes as a function of the degree and symmetry
of the loss. While current diagnostic tools can often indicate the presence or absence of OME, there are
significant limitations in our ability to determine the presence, degree, and symmetry of the CHL associated with
OME due to the challenges with behavioral audiological testing in young children, and no objective alternative to
behavioral testing currently exists. Further, even in cases where hearing status can be determined behaviorally,
determination of hearing at one time point does not indicate the stability of hearing thresholds or the risk and
magnitude of long-term deficits. Our long-term goal is to address these knowledge gaps comprehensively to
refine clinical practice guidelines by identifying children most at risk for long-term deficits to improve treatment
recommendations. As a first step, the primary objective of this proposal is to improve the diagnosis and
understanding of OME and its related hearing loss and investigate the influence of variability in cumulative
auditory deprivation on one sequela of OME, binaural processing. In Aim 1, we will develop a non-invasive
objective estimate of hearing loss due to OME. In Aim 2, we will characterize the short-term stability and
persistence of OME and its related hearing loss and determine the prognostic value of a non-invasive measure
of middle-ear mechanics. In Aim 3, we will determine the influence of OME-related variations in CHL and middle-ear mechanics on individual differences in binaural processing. Completion of these Aims will achieve a first step
toward our long-term goal of understanding the consequences of OME and developing tools to identify children
most at risk for negative sequelae by both improving our ability to objectively determine prognosis and hearing
status over time and improving our understanding of how these factors contribute to individual variability in long-term outcomes."
10900394,"ABSTRACT – OVERALL
The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) proposes to develop and implement the “UTEP Center for Investigator
Training and Community Engagement in Transdisciplinary Minority Health Disparities Research,” to provide a
specialized community-engaged research training program whereby academic and community partnerships will
jointly participate in the design and implementation of collaborative research projects aimed at eliminating health
disparities in the Paso del Norte region. El Paso, Texas, located on the U.S.-Mexico border is a medically
underserved area with a predominantly Hispanic population. A large majority of the population in El Paso, Texas
has an income below the national average, speak a language other than English at home, and faces multiple
health conditions including overweight, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer among many others. The University of
Texas at El Paso, providing higher education to a large majority of populations in the Paso Del Norte region is
committed to improve the economic landscape and the health of the community by instituting equitable academic-
community partnerships to develop interventions based in community-based health research results. The
proposed Center of Excellence (COE) builds on UTEP’s strong foundation of demonstrated commitment for
community-engaged scholarship, a strong record of intellectual community-engaged capacity and robust support
from community-based organizations. The COE includes three cores that are intimately integrated and
synchronized to provide training, mentoring, dissemination, and translation of research to inform health policy.
The conceptual framework of the COE includes a syndemics model/approach, interdisciplinary and
transdisciplinary approach to train investigators and community partners and leverages a long-existing institutional
community-engaged culture and networks. A team of scholars will develop a pilot project program and community
engaged mentoring to develop community-engaged pilot projects, institute active coaching for grant writing for
early career investigators and community members, mentoring workshops for investigators at all career levels,
and community engaged transdisciplinary/interdisciplinary minority (Hispanic) health disparities research. The
proposed syndemics approach will help develop equitable academic-community partnerships that will understand
the interconnectivity of social determinants of health and morbidities affecting the region’s population. This new
knowledge augmented by a specialized community-engaged research training will provide UTEP investigators
and community collaborators with the basis for the design of culturally relevant, cutting-edge, effective, and
sustainable interventions. UTEP’s COE is committed to work with UTEP institutional units (e.g., Center for
Community Engagement, Community Engagement Leadership Program), other resources, and with healthcare-
engaged community partners to increase and sustain a network of academic-community partnerships and a
critical mass of investigators who conduct community-engaged Health disparities research now, and in the future."
10900395,"ABSTRACT – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The overarching goal of the Administrative Core (AC) is to provide organizational structure to the Center of
Excellence (COE) by developing and implementing an efficient governance and management plan. The
Administrative Core uses the NIMHD Research Framework's levels of influence to configure the Center's
structure and adopts a multi-principal investigator approach that is highly participative in its decision-making
process. This Core will build on the extensive administrative, scientific, and program evaluation expertise of its
staff to accomplish the Center's goals. The Administrative Core's Advisory Board will provide feedback to this
Core to ensure an integrated, interdisciplinary, community-driven, culturally sensitive, and regionally relevant to
the health disparities research mission of the COE. The Administrative Core is responsible for the coordination,
integration, and management of the Center's activities and the provision of administrative support for the
Investigator Development and Community-Engagement and Dissemination Cores, and for facilitating
resources needed to achieve their goals. Specific activities pertaining to this core are to develop and
implement an efficient organizational and governance structure, develop governance guidelines, conduct fiscal
management, provide oversight to the implementation cores' plans, comply with institutional training and
federal regulations and policies, and maintain a strong internal and external communication with stakeholders.
The Administrative Core is responsible for creating common data collection repositories across the Cores,
monitoring and documenting investigator training activities, supporting community engagement and
dissemination activities, monitoring progress and outcomes, and monitoring career development outcomes for
all trained investigators and community-engagement core activities. In addition, the Administrative Core will
advocate for the integration of Community Engagement leadership (CEL) designated courses to augment a
culture of community-engaged research among investigators affiliated with the center. Investigators teaching
CEL courses will foment a culture of community-engagement research among their students, thus contributing
to the development of the next generation of community-engaged researchers. The Administrative Core will
support the successful achievement of the Center's activities by providing strategic direction, timely oversight,
management, administration, integration, and coordination of the overall Center's team-based community-
engaged research activities. In addition, this core will provide support to the implementation of a rigorous and
continuous evaluation plan, develop and submit annual progress reports to stakeholders, and prepare annual
progress reports for NIMHD. The Administrative Core will be instrumental in the achievement of the Center's
goals and in establishing the COE as a recognized and prestigious Center for addressing health disparities in
the Paso del Norte Region."
10900396,"Abstract- Investigator Development Core
The Investigator Development Core of the “UTEP Center for Investigator Training and Community
Engagement in Transdisciplinary Minority Health Disparities Research,” will be critical in advancing the Center
goals for a robust model of community engaged transdisciplinary minority (Hispanic) health disparities research
training. The University of Texas at El Paso's (UTEP) unique US-MX Border location and strong community
engagement and servingness with local Hispanic communities (83% Hispanic) will be utilized for implementing
investigator development. Social determinants of health intersect and interact to significantly impact health
disparities in minority (Hispanic) communities like the ones we serve. However, health disparities research
design less frequently tends to incorporate such complex intersections and interactions at the big picture level
to holistically and collectively shape health span of minority populations. The specific aims of the investigator
development core are: (1) to enhance minority health disparities research and community engagement of
investigators of all levels across disciplines at UTEP through career enhancement opportunities in
transdisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary health disparities research that spans multiple domains and levels of
influence on risk and resilience and, (2) to foster an institution-wide culture change for investigator
development in inter/transdisciplinary, translational and community engaged scholarship to help develop,
expand and retain a network of minority health disparities researchers during and beyond program years 1-5.
Investigator training in Minority (Hispanic) Health Disparities Research will be fostered through two main
components: (i) Pilot Project Program and (ii) Community Engaged Mentoring. Community engaged pilot
projects (N=21), Intensive Active Coaching in grantsmanship for early career investigators (N=50), a
comprehensive community engaged health disparities research workshop series for investigators at all career
levels across all disciplines (N=150), an innovative minority-user centered academic mentor-community
mentor-investigator mentee triad model mentoring for early career investigators (N=50) and, support for a
network community engaged minority health disparities researchers will be implemented through Program
Years 1 to 5. Outcomes expected include (i) a sustainable institutional level scalable community-campus
mentorship model for transdisciplinary minority health disparities research; (ii) effective mentor-mentee
relationships for investigators of all levels, (iii) expanding networks of health disparities researchers who can
address syndemics in inter/transdisciplinary and community engaged study designs, (iii) established multi-
sectorial community partnerships (iv) sustained investigator grantsmanship progress in community engaged
minority health research (v) increase in community engaged scholarship dissemination, and (vii) advancing
guidelines and policies for big-picture, trans/interdisciplinary minority health disparities research."
10900397,"ABSRACT – COMMUNITY ENGAGMENT AND DISSEMINATION CORE
The overarching goal of the Community Engagement and Dissemination (CoED) Core is to build
community research capacity to address health disparities and inequalities to create a foundation for health
equity among Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) and academic partners. Further, this core is charged
with delivering findings via community-relevant messages in English and/or Spanish as well as to the scientific
community. Foundational theories for partnership activities include using the NIMHD Research Framework,
Social Determinants of Health, and Syndemics to understand the scope of health disparities to create health
equities in our U.S.-Mexico border community. Initial activities include establishing key priorities for the five-
year project. The CoED Core focuses on knowledge and skills development for the community-investigator
partnerships through the Pilot Project Program (PPP) and Community Engaged Mentorship (CEM) in the
Investigator Development Core for understanding and conducting ethical, mutually beneficial, culturally
appropriate, and meaningful community-based participatory research. The Core will use the Community
Academic Partnership for Health Sciences Research (CAPHSR)'s Guiding Principles and Research
Expectations for the PPP and community investigators. Additional activities target the skills to deliver health
messages in a culturally and linguistically inclusive manner (English and Spanish) to reach U.S.- Mexico
border constituents. The Core will use a Dissemination Planning Matrix to identify relevant strategies and
media for communicating health disparities and ultimately research findings to the Community Based
Organization (CBO) stakeholders and to the community at large. The PPP teams will provide annual writing
workshops to engage and integrate the community voices when writing for a scientific audience. To further
community integration, online writing groups will be implemented to involve community members in the co-
creation of the writing process. This multi-layered approach to engaging community voices in translational
research and dissemination will result in an increased capacity to identify, evaluate, address, and communicate
health disparities findings to the U.S.- Mexico border community. Our center builds on a strong foundation of
demonstrated commitment for the unique diversity of our bilingual, binational, multicultural communities,
trajectory of effective community-engaged scholarship and partnerships, a solid record of intellectual capacity
and robust support from community-based organizations. The CoED team with demonstrated community
engaged scholarship will support the goals of the Investigator Development core and the center as a whole to
advance community engaged transdisciplinary Hispanic health disparities research. Our ability to identify and
develop community engagement and dissemination opportunities will leverage our strengths and continue to
adapt and propel health equity."

Chlamydia trachomatis (C.t.) is the leading cause of non-congenital blindness and the most prevalent sexually
transmitted bacterial infection in the world, which if left untreated can result in severe consequences. All
chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacteria and thus gaining entry into a host cell is essential for the pathogen
to complete its replicative cycle and proliferate. Despite the critical nature of the invasion process, the molecular
mechanisms and details regarding how C.t. forces its way into non-phagocytic cells remains a large knowledge
gap. A major premise of the current model suggests that invasion is facilitated by delivery of prepackaged
conventional type III secretion system (cT3SS) effector proteins into the host cell prior to pathogen entry. We
hypothesize that a subset of these cT3SS effectors coordinate active subversion of the host cytoskeleton through
direct manipulation of key regulators of actin dynamics. New data from our laboratory indicates that the cT3SS
effector protein TmeA binds to the nucleation promoting factor N-WASP, both of which we show are essential
for invasion. In Aim 1, we will mechanistically determine how TmeA regulates N-WASP and determine whether
this interaction promotes key membrane features that likely aid in bacterial entry such as; membrane ruffling,
pedestal formation, and filopodial dynamics. Given the essential nature of invasion to bacterial proliferation and
survival, C.t. likely employs multiple measures for invasion. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the complex interplay
between TarP, TepP, and TmeA and reveal the ultimate molecular effects of their effector function and describe
how the seemingly disparate pathways targeted by these effectors converge to assure chlamydial invasion.
Furthermore, we will determine whether other cT3SS effectors, only expressed in the invasive EB form of
chlamydia, are necessary for invasion of non-phagocytic cells. Detailed characterization of the bacterial and host
proteins required to promote reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton during C.t. invasion will provide a holistic
view of how intracellular pathogens, such as C.t., coordinate subversion of cytoskeletal regulators to invade host
cells."
10899747,"The application responds to PAR-21-130: Clinical Trials to Test the Effectiveness of Treatment, Prevention,
and Services Interventions. With an incidence rate of about 1%, Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a serious mental
disorder associated with high mortality, morbidity and cost but becomes highly resistant once it has taken an
enduring course. The first-line treatment for adolescents with AN is Family Based Treatment (FBT), but is not
available to many patients. An effective strategy used with other eating disorders to address impediments to
scaling effective treatments is guided self-help (GSH) versions of efficacious treatments. We developed,
refined, and tested GSH-FBT in case series and pilot studies. Results of a multisite randomized feasibility
study comparing GSH-FBT to FBT-V found that both treatments were similarly acceptable to families with good
recruitment rates, low attrition rates, high completion rates of assessments, and were safe to deliver while
achieving similar improvements in eating related cognitions and weight. However, GSH-FBT achieved these
outcomes with greater efficiency (e.g., larger ratio of improvement in weight and cognitions to therapist
treatment time) by utilizing approximately 75% less therapist time than FBT-V. The main aim of this proposed
comparative effectiveness study is to confirm that clinical improvements in GSH-FBT are achieved with greater
efficiency than FBT-V in generalizable clinical settings. If this outcome is confirmed, it will lead to an increased
opportunity to utilize and scale an effective treatment for adolescent AN, promote increased access and
improve outcomes for these patients. We will also explore therapist attitudes toward GSH-FBT. To conduct this
study 200 adolescents with DSM-5 AN and their families will be randomized to either GSH-FBT or FBT-V in
two treatment sites (Stanford Children’s Hospital Eating Disorder Clinic and the Ontario Provincial Network of
Ministry-funded Specialized Treatment Services for Eating Disorders). The main outcome will be clinical
efficiency (the ratio of change in weight and eating related distorted cognitions to therapist time). Parental self-
efficacy will be assessed as a potential mediator of treatment effect. Family structure and severity of eating
related obsessions will be examined as moderators. Weights will be collected from session 1-4 to assess early
weight gain as a predictor of weight remission at the end of treatment (EOT). Data on therapists’ views of
GSH-FBT implementation will be collected by quantitative measures at BL and EOT, as well as by individual
semi-structured qualitative interviews. Both primary and secondary outcomes will be analyzed in line with the
intention to treat principle."
10879333,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Leveraging Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to understand disease has proven challenging, as the
underlying biological mechanisms are often poorly captured by bulk tissues. Recent advances in single-cell
sequencing have led to a torrent of data across multiple modalities, contexts, and individuals, which provide an
unprecedented opportunity to understand disease biology at high resolution. We hypothesize that the fine-scale
cellular contexts captured by single-cell data will be effective at explaining disease heritability and fine-mapping
disease mechanisms. However, current approaches to integrate single-cell data with GWAS largely rely on off-
the-shelf approaches developed for bulk sequencing, which obscure the rich phenotypic diversity present in
individual cells within and across canonical cell types. The sparse and highly variable nature of single-cell data
has additionally posed challenges for robustly identifying single-cell quantitative trait loci (QTL). Single-cell data
continues to increase in size and complexity, emphasizing the need for scalable integrative modeling. Here, we
propose a 5 year research plan to develop novel approaches for integrating single-cell data with GWAS by
modeling complex cellular phenotypes not captured by existing bulk approaches. Our proposal will identify novel
disease-relevant cell states; leverage multiple single-cell modalities to fine-map disease variants and their target
genes; and discover novel single-cell QTLs associated with disease. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: Leveraging
single-cell epigenetic data to identify heritable components of disease; Aim 2: Leveraging single-cell data to fine-
map disease variants and their mechanisms; Aim 3: Defining the regulatory effects of disease variants using
population-scale scRNA-seq. While our proposed approaches are broadly applicable to common diseases, we
will benchmark them on immune-related traits and neuropsychiatric traits which we have studied extensively with
bulk datasets in published work and where we have now aggregated a large collection of relevant single-cell
datasets. Our collaboration has multiple strengths: our focus on functional data integration across multiple single-
cell modalities; our broad statistical and computational expertise; and our extensive, data-driven publication
record on common disease."
10879335,"Over half of adolescents with Down syndrome (DS) have difficulty being understood by others which negatively
impacts their engagement in daily life activities that require communication (i.e., communicative participation).
Restrictions in communicative participation are not trivial and lead to un- and underemployment and loneliness
which, in turn, lead to poor mental and physical health outcomes. Despite the urgent need, interventions to
improve speech production in adolescents with DS are rare. Thus, speech-language pathologists use
treatments that are designed for adults, are not specific to the underlying impairment in DS, and do not
consider the unique psychosocial issues faced by adolescents. The long-term goal of this line of research is to
bring a precision medicine approach to the development of theoretically-driven, evidence-based, participation-
focused interventions for adolescents with DS. As a first step, we will construct deep phenotypes of
communicative participation for adolescents with DS. Current intervention approaches focus exclusively on the
underlying impairment while ignoring both the adolescent’s perspective and the societal structures that
contribute to their disability. A key innovation of this proposal is the shift away from treating communicative
participation solely as an impairment-level issue and toward a model of communicative participation that
encompasses a broader view of functioning. To do so, we will employ the conceptual framework detailed in
Baylor (Co-I) and Darling-White (PI; 2020) that models communicative participation as a biopsychosocial
construct comprised of the following elements: communication skills (e.g., the underlying impairment), personal
perspectives (e.g., preferences, coping), and communication environment (e.g., physical, social). Each
element contributes to restrictions in communicative participation and warrants full consideration in intervention
design and implementation. A critical barrier to the development of participation-focused interventions for
adolescents with DS is the lack of empirical information regarding these elements, leaving us with a limited
ability to identify intervention targets, measure progress, and facilitate lasting change. The first specific aim of
this proposal is to construct impairment-level speech production profiles for adolescents with DS. The second
specific aim is to investigate how personal perspectives and communication environment alter communicative
participation for adolescents with DS. The third specific aim is to develop a mechanistic model of
communicative participation for adolescents with DS. The expected outcome of this proposal is the deep
phenotyping of communicative participation for adolescents with DS. By applying a precision medicine
approach within a biopsychosocial framework, this proposal will lay the foundation for the creation of
intervention that centers the patient perspective, addresses the underlying impairment based on
comprehensive speech production profiles, and engages societal structures that contribute to disability."
10879336,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Subconcussive head impacts (SHI), defined as a head impact without overt symptoms of concussion, are
incredibly common among soccer players as a result of soccer heading. SHI from repetitive soccer headings
may pose a risk of triggering neurodegenerative disorders later in life. However, despite the popularity of soccer
with nearly 24 million people in the U.S. across all ages and sexes playing soccer, there is currently no
prophylactic intervention to mitigate or ameliorate neurologic stress from soccer heading. Our data suggest at
least 4 neurologic features related to subconcussive brain injury. For example, acute SHI from soccer headings
and football tackles lead to elevation of neural injury blood biomarkers (NF-L, GFAP, tau, UCH-L1, S100B),
changes in axonal microstructural integrity, and sympathetic hyperreactivity, triggering hypertensive
characteristic, and neuro-ophthalmologic impairments, such as convergence and saccades. Growing data from
many preclinical and clinical studies suggest that these cellular and physiologic alterations may be preventable
by pretreatment with omega-3 fatty acids (FA), especially with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which has shown to alleviate neuronal and glial oxidation and calcium triggered
excitotoxicity, mitigate elevations of plasma NF-L levels (axonal injury marker), and maintain cognitive function
after various severities of traumatic brain injury (TBI). We propose a randomized controlled trial to obtain
mechanistic insights into the biophysiologic interaction between DHA+EPA pretreatment and acute SHI and
determine whether, and to what extent, pretreatment with DHA and EPA combined is neuroprotective against
repetitive SHI. Our central hypothesis is that DHA+EPA pretreatment will be neuroprotective against SHI.
We hypothesize that 20 controlled acute soccer headings will result in microdamage to neuronal structures and
sympathetic hyperreactivity, but that 8 weeks of pretreatment with 3.4 g/d DHA+EPA will significantly prevent
such alterations. There are three synergistic aims. We hypothesize that (1) DHA+EPA will prevent neuronal and
astrocyte damage after acute and cumulative SHI, as assessed by the panel of blood biomarkers (NF-L, tau,
GFAP, UCH-L1, S100B); (2) DHA+EPA pretreatment will attenuate disruption in axonal microstructure and
altered functional connectivity after acute and cumulative soccer headings; and (3) DHA+EPA pretreatment will
prevent the triggering of sympathetic hyperreactivity after soccer headings, as reflected by a typical
cardiovascular response to the cold pressor test. If our hypotheses are confirmed, our findings will provide a
means to intervene in the SHI-induced neurological damage that can be monitored through multimodal
neurologic assessments. Clinical implications of the study translate beyond soccer to the public at large."
10879659,"We propose to explore the role of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent system in enhancing and
“sharpening” the encoding of complex sounds. We will use extracellular recordings in awake animals of inferior
colliculus (IC) and ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body, where MOC neurons are located. We also propose
psychophysical studies in humans, click-evoked otoacoustic-emission measurements, and a new
computational model that includes efferent pathways. In previous grant cycles, we discovered a novel neural-
coding strategy based on relatively slow fluctuations in the responses of auditory-nerve (AN) fibers, referred to
as neural fluctuations (NFs). For listeners with normal hearing, contrasts in NF profiles along the tonotopic axis
provide a robust code for spectral peaks and valleys across a wide range of sound levels and frequencies, as
well as in noise, but NF contrasts are adversely affected by sensorineural hearing loss. NF contrasts are
shaped by peripheral tuning and nonlinearities, which are in turn strongly affected by cochlear gain, motivating
our focus on the MOC system in this application. The MOC has traditionally been described as the hub of a
short reflex loop, with wide-dynamic-range inputs from the cochlear nucleus and an output that projects directly
to cochlear outer hair cells to modulate cochlear gain. An assumed role of the efferent system is to increase
the dynamic range of neurons, reducing rate saturation. It has not been possible to test this assumption using
AN recordings, but cochlear nucleus recordings in unanesthetized animals reveal that responses are saturated
at moderate levels and dynamic ranges are not increased, bringing into question this presumed function of the
efferent system. We propose a new concept: a purpose of the efferent system is to maintain and
enhance, or sharpen, NF contrasts. A less-studied but major input to the MOC descends from the IC.
Because nearly all IC neurons are sensitive to slow fluctuations on their inputs, NF contrasts are represented
by the profile of rates across the population of IC neurons. We hypothesize that IC input to the MOC
provides the NF-driven signal that is required by a control system that maintains and enhances NF
contrasts. The IC-rate profile, combined with the wide-dynamic-range input from the cochlear nucleus,
provides the efferent system with the information required to control NF contrasts across a wide range of
acoustic conditions. Exciting preliminary results support the hypothesis that this system actively sharpens the
representation of complex sounds. Our new computational model that includes efferent pathways provides
testable predictions for IC and MOC physiological responses and for psychophysical performance in human
listeners, with varying degrees of sensorineural hearing loss. Understanding nonintuitive effects of different
degrees of sensorineural hearing loss on NF profiles, in the context of dynamic MOC feedback, provides new
insight into the perceptual consequences of sensorineural hearing loss, and points towards novel strategies to
aid these listeners."
10879902,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There are no approved drug therapies to prevent or reverse intellectual disability in neurodevelopmental
disorders. Down syndrome (DS) is the most prevalent genetic cause of intellectual disability, yet it is exceedingly
complex to understand and treat as hundreds of genes on the triplicated human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) may
contribute to its presentation. New approaches are needed to dissect these many genetic influences and their
potential interactions on the development of the body and brain. The larval zebrafish offers a solution to this
large-scale challenge, as many genes can be manipulated and resulting phenotypes compared with highly
sensitive methods. Relevant features of this animal model include optical transparency, external development,
genetic conservation, and a vertebrate nervous system structure. The similarity of zebrafish and human proteins
and signaling pathways supports their use in high-throughput drug discovery, and multiple compounds identified
in zebrafish studies have entered clinical trials. With this study, we will address the need for new treatments for
intellectual disability in DS by investigating disrupted mechanisms of brain development and by screening for
small molecules that can prevent observed abnormalities. For Aim 1 of this proposal, we will define the effect of
overexpressing many Hsa21 genes individually and in combination on zebrafish development, brain activity,
brain structure, and behavior. This aim follows a pipeline we previously used successfully for a large screen of
genes associated with schizophrenia. While Aim 1 will cast a wide net, agnostic to which signaling pathways
might be affected, Aim 2 will directly investigate a defective cellular response to the Sonic hedgehog mitogen
that has been strongly implicated by mouse studies and DS phenotypes. Using classical developmental biology
approaches and cutting-edge genomics, we will study a particular factor highlighted by recent cell culture studies.
We hypothesize that increased levels of this Hsa21 gene reshapes the epigenome during early embryonic
development to cause a reduced response to Hedgehog signaling. Building on phenotypes for this promising
candidate, we will screen for other Hsa21 genes that impart synergistic or opposing effects on Hedgehog
responsiveness. Defining how Hsa21 genes contribute to signaling deficits will clarify the underlying processes
disrupted in DS, yield fundamental knowledge of neural development, highlight novel protein targets for drug
discovery, and establish phenotypes to rescue in future drug screens. Finally, for Aim 3, we will screen for small
molecules that can prevent developmental phenotypes in zebrafish. Taken together, the proposed aims will
provide a foundation for understanding the causes of DS and set the stage for multiple translational efforts."
10883748,"Project Summary and Abstract
 Up to 20% of all Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) clinical isolates are obtained from urinary sources, and a
large portion of these urinary cases have their onset outside of hospitals. 40-60% of urinary isolates in our region
are multidrug resistant (MDR), demonstrating how Ab contributes to the growing epidemic of multidrug resistant
(MDR) urinary tract infections (UTIs). Despite the demand for novel, antibiotic-sparing interventions against Ab
UTIs, the microbial factors that mediate uropathogenic A. baumannii (UPAb) virulence and the host factors that
predispose to UPAb infections, remain poorly defined. We recently demonstrated that Ab strains vary in their
ability to colonize the urinary tract in a murine UTI model. Additionally, we identified microbial elements that
increase an Ab strain’s ability to infect bladders but do not contribute to its virulence in respiratory infections.
Lastly, in a recent epidemiological study, we found that Ab urinary and respiratory cases exhibited diverging
clinical and microbiological characteristics. Altogether, these findings are strongly suggestive that UPAb
comprise an Ab subpopulation distinctively equipped to infect urinary tracts, compared to Ab that cause other
types of infections.
 This proposal addresses fundamental points in understanding Ab epidemiology and pathobiology, with a
specific focus on Ab urovirulence:
 1) Are UPAb a distinguishable subpopulation of clinically-relevant Ab?
 2) Do host predisposing factors differ between Ab UTI versus other types of Ab infections? Versus
 UTI caused by other, more common uropathogens (i.e., Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas)?
 3) Can reducing UPAb’s intrinsic ability to survive in urine be a strategy to curb its urovirulence?
 Using comparative genomic analysis pipelines developed in the Dantas Lab, I will investigate microbial
molecular determinants of urinary disease in a large bank of Acinetobacter clinical isolates matched to their
respective clinical data. I will also identify host characteristics associated with Ab UTI in a published retrospective
cohort of over 2000 Ab cases in our healthcare system. Lastly, employing molecular techniques and murine UTI
models developed in the Feldman lab, I will investigate the prospective link between a UPAb strain’s ability to
grow in human urine, and its ability to infect the murine urinary tract. This will evaluate whether in vitro urine
growth models can be effectively employed to screen for MDR Ab UTI therapeutic targets. Through successful
completion of this research, undergoing the didactic training, and receiving guidance from a multidisciplinary
mentoring committee of experts, I aim to launch my career as an independent translational researcher
investigating the host and microbial determinants of pathogenesis in neglected forms of Acinetobacter disease."
10879309,"ABSTRACT
The APOE ɛ2 and ɛ4 alleles are by far the strongest and most well-established common genetic risk factors for
Alzheimer disease (AD). The deleterious effect of ɛ4 on AD risk is dependent on dose, age, sex, and ethnicity,
but the protective effect of ɛ2 is is less well studied. We will build upon our previous work aimed at identifying
mechanisms underlying the associations of AD with the ɛ2 and ɛ4 alleles in multiple population groups. Recently,
we identified a highly significant association of AD with PPP2CB among ɛ2 carriers. PPP2CB encodes the
catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, which is known to dephosphorylate tau protein. Complement C4A
and C4B were the most significantly differentially expressed genes in brain tissue from AD cases and controls
with the ɛ2/ɛ3 genotype, and we showed that levels of C4b and PPP2CB proteins are significantly correlated.
We also identified a novel genome-wide significant association of AD with MGMT that is specific to women
lacking ɛ4 (ε4-). Omics analyses of brain-derived data showed significant association of (1) MGMT AD risk alleles
with increased MGMT methylation (2) MGMT methylation with MGMT expression and worse AD-related
pathology in ε4- women. This proposed project will identify new ε2- and ε4-mediated AD associations using a
greatly enlarged multi-ethnic Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium GWAS sample and GWAS datasets from
European AD genetics consortia which include more than 240,000 subjects. Next, we will identify functional
variants in the identified loci in large whole genome whole exome sequencing datasets from diverse populations
assembled by the Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project. We will calculate ethnicity-specific AD polygenic risk
scores (PRS) for APOE genotype subgroups and evaluate the moderating effect of each PRS score on AD risk
associated with ɛ2 and ɛ4. In a second aim, we will perform proteomic studies in plasma from 2,813 Framingham
Heart Study participants to identify proteins whose expression is associated with AD status and measures of
cognitive performance in the total sample and APOE genotype groups. We will then investigate methylation and
transcriptome profiles in the APOE related loci in 1,391 blood and 952 brain samples from European and African
ancestry subjects. APOE genotype-dependent omics signatures derived from these analyses will be validated
by testing their association with AD-related neuropathological traits and other proteins measured in brain by
multiplex immunofluorescence. Finally, in a third aim we will determine mechanisms through which genes
identified by GWAS confer protection against AD pathophysiology using a novel human iPSC-derived human
3D spheroid model of AD that allows testing of multiple brain cell types. We will generate the model by growing
induced neurons, astrocytes and microglia separately in 2D cultures, and then combining them in 3D cultures
where the integrated neurodegenerative process ensues. We will selectively transduce neurons, astrocytes and
microglia from these cultures with target genes to investigate cell-specific actions of each gene."
10930145,"There are ~680,000 adolescent and young adult cancer survivors (AYACS) in the U.S., and this number is likely
to grow as the incidence of cancer in this age-group is rising. AYACS experience significant disruptions to
achieving normative developmental milestones (e.g. completion of education, developing a career, dating,
marriage, child birth), which often results in elevated rates of depressive symptoms compared to healthy peers
and other cancer survivors. Among cancer survivors, depressive symptoms associated with poorer quality of life,
lower adherence to medical recommendations, increased healthcare utilization/costs, and elevated mortality risk.
Though psychosocial interventions for depression are efficacious in the general population, few have been
adapted for use with AYACS. Additionally, interventions to improve depressive symptoms have typically been
provided in-person, which has resulted in many barriers to participation (e.g., distance, limited clinician
availability “after hours”) that are problematic for AYACS who tend to have many competing commitments wuch
as school, work, and parenting. Therefore, it is critical to develop AYACS-targeted interventions that can be
delivered remotely and on-demand such as mobile health applications (mHealth apps). The objective of this
proposal is to prepare and optimize a mHealth app to promote self-management of depressive symptoms among
AYACS (iManageAYA), guided by the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) framework. MOST is a
framework adapted from engineering that uses highly efficient factorial experiments to evaluate individual and
combined effects of intervention components to determine which ones can be reduced, eliminated, or replaced
to improve efficiency. During the K99 phase, I propose using an iterative user-centered design process to prepare
a prototype of iManageAYA that is usable, acceptable, and feasible for AYACS. This intervention will consist of
a core application and four evidence-based components: 1) behavioral activation; 2) cognitive restructuring; 3)
mindfulness training; and 4) peer support. During the R00 phase, I will determine which intervention components
reduce depressive symptoms using a full factorial experiment. I will use the results of this experiment to develop
an intervention that only includes components that significantly contributed to reductions in depressive symptoms
among AYACS, minimizing participant burden. I plan to propose future studies will test the efficacy of this
optimized intervention, as well as strategies for its dissemination and implementation. In addition to the proposed
research, I will extend my knowledge and skills in: 1) user-centered design; 2) the MOST approach; 3) the
conduct of clinical trials with AYACS; 4) dissemination and implementation science and 5) professional
development. This K99/R00 award will enable my transition to an independent career conducting innovative
research to develop, evaluate, implement, and disseminate psychosocial interventions that address the unique
needs of AYACS. My mentoring team and collaborators have the necessary skills and resources to assist me in
achieving my goals and will ensure that I successfully transition to an independent investigator."
10879228,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Access to greater varieties, amounts, and potencies of cannabis has increased dramatically in the U.S. over the
past decade as more states legalize cannabis for medical and adult use. Research on cannabis users who
consume in a controlled manner, that is, in a way that does not compromise responsibilities to family and work
or minimizes risk to self, is limited despite the fact that most cannabis users do not become dependent or develop
a disorder. Significantly, models of controlled cannabis use have been inhibited from developing historically due
to factors related to stigma and illegality, but are urgently needed as states continue to legalize cannabis for
medical and adult use, which increases availability and access to potent cannabis products. Our long-term goal
in this renewal of a currently funded R01 is to advance the scientific understanding of safer and controlled use
of cannabis in policy environments where access to cannabis and potent products is high or increasing. Our
objective here is to advance the conceptualization and assessment of controlled cannabis use across different
policy environments for clinical and community-wide dissemination to fill research and practical gaps in
knowledge. We will achieve this objective by sampling from two ongoing longitudinal cohorts of cannabis users
-- 23-37-year-old adult users in CA (n=200) and 23-37-year-old medical users in PA (n=200) -- utilizing a
measurement burst design that incorporates 21 days of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and
quantitative surveys over two time points plus qualitative interviews. Our central hypothesis is that persons who
exhibit greater control over their cannabis use (via greater adherence to rituals and rules, e.g., “don’t use
cannabis before work or driving” or “only use on the weekends”, defined as controlled users) will report lower
cannabis use and better psychosocial functioning across the study period compared to uncontrolled users. This
renewal study is guided by findings from our current studies of young adult cannabis users as well as theoretical
insights into controlled use of cannabis described in Zinberg’s classic book Drug, Set, and Setting – specifically
the application of rules and rituals derived from social “setting.” Our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing
three specific aims: 1) Develop and test a new scale assessing the rules of controlled cannabis use to be utilized
during the subsequent EMA study; 2) Determine daily cannabis use practices and psychosocial functioning
among controlled and uncontrolled users in contrasting policy environments using EMA and a baseline survey
(n=400); 3) Identify longitudinal patterns of daily cannabis use practices and psychosocial functioning among
controlled and uncontrolled users using EMA and surveys from two time points (n=400), and qualitative
interviews (n=100). Deliverables from this project include: (1) a theoretically derived instrument assessing the
rules of controlled cannabis use; (2) a fine-grained, process-level understanding of controlled use of cannabis
over time via EMA, annual surveys, and qualitative interviews; (3) key factors/mechanisms identified via Aims 1-
3 that can inform the development of policies and interventions to support controlled and safer use of cannabis."
10901873,"The recent emergence of various spatially resolved transcriptomic technologies have enabled the study of
spatial transcriptomic landscape across a tissue section or within single cells, catalyzing new discoveries in
many areas of biology. Despite the fast development of spatial transcriptomic technologies, however,
statistical methods for analyzing spatial transcriptomic data are vastly underdeveloped. Analyzing spatial
transcriptomic data faces important statistical challenges that arise from the complexities and unique features
of these data. Here, we propose to address some of these key statistical challenges in this emerging field
through developing a suite of novel statistical methods. Specifically, we will (1) develop Gaussian predictive
process models to model the spatial correlation structure in a computational effective way to rapidly identify
genes with spatial expression patterns; (2) develop integrative methods to incorporate reference single cell
RNA sequencing data along with spatial correlation structure in spatial transcriptomics to enable accurate
deconvolution of cell types on the tissue; (3) develop Potts models to perform tissue segmentation and detect
tissue regions and microenvironment in a de novo fashion. We will develop, distribute, and support user-friendly
open-source software implementing the proposed methods and disseminate them to the scientific
community. We will perform rigorous and comprehensive simulations and apply our methods to analyze
multiple public spatial transcriptomics data that are collected from different technical platforms and are of
different scales. We will also perform an in-depth analysis with supplemental experiments on the spatial
transcriptomics data being collected as part of the study of the role of dysregulated stem cell biology in breast
cancer disparities in African American women."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overarching mission of the Cancer Health Outcomes and Control Research Program (CO) is to foster
research that can engage and reach out to the catchment area community to reduce the public health burden of
cancer across the entire care continuum and to improve health-related outcomes for those at risk for or with a
diagnosis of cancer. This research, which spans basic, clinical and population-based science across the cancer
care continuum. can be broadly categorized into three thematic domains: 1) prevention and early detection; 2)
patient-centered health outcomes during and following cancer treatment; and 3) implementation of healthcare
interventions and policy to improve cancer care delivery and decrease cancer health disparities. CO will conduct
research across these three domains through the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Identify and evaluate strategies targeted to cancer prevention and early detection and develop
and test behavioral- and laboratory-based interventions in healthy and at-risk populations
Aim 2. Assess and compare patient-centered outcomes during and following cancer therapy in order to
inform development of treatment strategies that best balance efficacy with toxicity
Aim 3. Develop and implement healthcare interventions and policies on a population, practice or
individual level that improve access to and delivery of care to minimize the burden of cancer in the VICC
catchment area and nationally
Alongside these scientific aims, the Program will develop opportunities to promote intra- and inter-programmatic
research, training and mentorship with engagement of and outreach to the VICC community in a bidirectional
manner to meet its mission.
There are 29 program members from 14 departments and 5 schools with $8.9M in total peer-reviewed funding
and NCI making up 47% ($4.2M). Out of 477 publications, 15% are intra-programmatic and 19% are inter-
programmatic. Members also have 257 collaborative publications with investigators at other NCI-designated
cancer centers."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) has a dynamic and diverse leadership team that encompasses
expertise across all facets of the cancer research and clinical enterprises and provides oversight of basic, clinical,
translational, prevention, control and population-based research programs. Working collaboratively and
effectively, the senior leaders have enhanced organizational capabilities, and planning and evaluation activities
to reduce the cancer burden in our community and globally. Leadership, Planning and Evaluation activities
provide a structured workstreams for assessing our current status, identifying opportunities and formulating
approaches for implementing the VICC mission. VICC carries out internal and external evaluation and strategic
planning to inform and support its decision-making processes. The significant accomplishments of VICC
membership and leadership, described throughout this renewal application, provide evidence of an effective and
productive leadership team and the use of planning and evaluation (internal and external) processes. Since the
last competing renewal a new strategic plan was initiated with a focus on expansion of research programs
through continued recruitment of 67 talented investigators that joined the VICC membership and collectively
advanced scientific discovery. As the goals of the 2014-2019 VICC Strategic Plan have been largely
accomplished, in 2017, the Director and Senior Leadership embarked upon a new strategic planning process,
which has been approved for the next project period and endorsed by the External Scientific Advisory Board
(ESAB). The intent of the plan is to continue to invest in programs and people that are essential for continued
translation of discoveries to patients, expand select areas of research as dictated by needs and opportunities
and further strengthen the position of the matrix Center within the region, nation and worldwide. Key objectives
of the new plan include: 1) advancing fundamental discoveries, 2) moving discoveries to interventions, 3)
enabling a systems approach to cancer, and 4) reducing cancer disparities and burden. External evaluation is
provided by the ESAB, Community Advisory Board, and Board of Overseers; providing expert guidance and
insights to VICC leadership and membership on opportunities for collaborations and engagement, catchment
area needs, development of programs, merit of research accomplishments and feedback on performance.
Several internal mechanisms provide comprehensive planning and evaluation within VICC; these include the
Executive Committee, Research Program Leaders Committee, Shared Resource Oversight Group, CRCERA
Advisory Committee, and others. Together, these external and internal evaluation groups provide advice to the
Director, who has ultimate responsibility and authority for setting the vision and priorities for the Center as a
whole in order to promote transdisciplinary scientific advances that can be translated to patients and community."

10927423,"Abstract
The 10,000 Families Study (10KFS) will be a new, family-based cohort study in Minnesota, the ‘Land of 10,000
Lakes’. Due to our high incidence rates of hematologic malignancy (leukemia, lymphoma, and myelodysplastic
syndromes), we will focus our proposal on environmental exposures of concern that are possible hematologic
carcinogens with limited evidence in humans as defined by the International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC). This includes glyphosate, poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and radon, all of which have
well-described geographic variation in prevalence in the state of Minnesota. During the UG3 phase, we will
evaluate innovative exposure assessment methodologies and recruit diverse participants into the 10KFS
cohort. Exposure assessment will include residential history, ambient measures in air and water at current
residence, as well as individual-level exposure assessed with silicone wearable bracelets, serum, hair, and
urine. Participants will be recruited from targeted counties that maximize the exposure distribution to our three
carcinogens of interest and include under-represented populations from rural and immigrant communities. We
will measure clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), a precursor to heme malignancy, and
perturbations in immunity and epigenetics as our primary cancer-related outcomes in the UH3 phase. Our
target is to recruit 8,750 participants from 4,000 households to participate using recruitment strategies that
have been developed and pilot tested. Our central hypothesis is that PFAS, glyphosate and radon contribute to
increased hematologic malignancy specifically, and cancer incidence broadly, in Minnesota. Cancer incidence
will be determined via annual record linkage with the Minnesota Cancer Reporting System (MCRS) and the
Virtual Pooled Registry Cancer Linkage System. The scientific aims in the UG3 phase will be to: 1) evaluate
innovative exposure assessment methods for PFAS and glyphosate that can be easily implemented in a large
scale study and 2) describe the exposure burden in under-represented immigrant populations. We will
complete recruitment of the study population in the UH3 phase where the specific aims are to: 1) determine
whether levels of radon, glyphosate, and PFAS are associated with increased prevalence of CHIP and 2)
utilize epigenomics to test the hypotheses that radon, glyphosate and PFAS exposure are associated with
immune dysregulation and epigenetic signatures. Our community engagement will be conducted in partnership
with the non-profit research institute Hispanic Advocacy and Community Empowerment Through Research
(HACER), the Minnesota Freemasons and Order of the Eastern Star and community educators from the
Extension Center for Family Development. The results of this study will provide needed data to inform whether
these agents are hematologic carcinogens, it will address documented disparities in exposure that occur within
our state and provide a mechanism for community outreach and education concerning these exposures and
any potential cancer link."
10933537,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sarcomas represent a rare and highly heterogeneous subtype of tumors that may develop across the lifespan.
In the United States (US), there are approximately 14,000 new cases annually, with approximately 65% survival.
Aside from those included in pediatric cancer survivor cohort studies, there are no sarcoma survivor cohorts in
which to systematically study recurrence, organ toxicity, function, quality of life, and survival as well as their
predictors. We propose to address these critical gaps in knowledge by establishing a cohort of approximately
2100 sarcoma survivors through the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) Sarcoma Treatment Center,
which is amongst the largest sarcoma programs in the US, in existence since 1987. In this cohort, we will
systematically collect repeated information on disease, treatment, response, relapse, treatment-related toxicity,
sociodemographics, lifestyle, functional status, quality of life, physical health outcomes, and survival, together
with biospecimens (tumor tissue and peripheral blood samples). We hypothesize that: 1) extrinsic factors, tumor
biology, and germline genomics contribute to oncologic outcomes and long-term organ toxicity; 2) healthy
lifestyle, e.g., high quality of diet, exercise, abstinence from cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking mitigate the
adverse health consequences, improve survival and quality of life among sarcoma survivors; and 3) liquid biopsy
tools, developed through identifying genomic drivers of sarcoma, will be of predictive and prognostic utility. Our
aims for current grant period are to evaluate1) the impact of disease, treatment, sociodemographic and lifestyle
contributors on adverse oncologic and non-oncologic outcomes and mortality in the cohort; 2) the role of drug
metabolism and DNA repair gene functional polymorphisms, genetically predicted gene expression levels, and
polygenic risk scores, on treatment efficacy and therapy-induced normal tissue toxicity; and 3) genomic drivers
of sarcoma to develop personalized liquid biopsy assays for monitoring treatment response, recurrence, and
minimal residual disease. Establishment of a prospective cohort of sarcoma survivors across the lifespan, with
extensive and well characterized clinical and epidemiologic data, patient reported outcomes, tumor tissue and
serial blood samples builds a foundation for a long-term prospective investigation on life after sarcoma. This
effort is critically important to improve the understanding of a rare tumor affecting the lifespan but seriously
underrepresented in research. Identification of health outcomes and their predictive and prognostic factors can
lead to precision treatment and survivorship care, which are currently clinically unmet needs."
10894899,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal describes a five-year research training program that will allow Dr Reeves to transition from a
quantitative researcher in physics and achieve his long-term goal of becoming an independent biomedical
researcher. Dr Reeves will develop a phylodynamic mathematical model, validated on diverse experimental
data, to improve the understanding of the creation, persistence, and elimination of the HIV reservoir.
 The training program incorporates the expertise of an outstanding group of mentors and collaborators.
Dr Reeves’s scientific advisory committee includes experts in modeling infectious diseases (Dr Josh Schiffer),
HIV cure (Dr Keith Jerome), viral evolution (Drs Morgane Rolland and Trevor Bedford), HIV reservoirs (Drs
Robert Siliciano and Peter Hunt), and statistics (Dr Peter Gilbert). This group is dedicated to ensuring the
success of this project and the development of Dr Reeves’ career as an independent researcher. The proposal
also contains professional mentorship (Dr Karen Peterson). The specific learning goals required for a
successful transition to biological research will be accomplished through didactic coursework in virology,
immunology, and phylogenetics as well as conferences and professional training in the skills of a successful
mentor and group leader.
 Currently, no cure for HIV exists. Individuals living with HIV face the difficult prescription of a lifetime of
daily antiretroviral therapy (ART). Understanding the persistence of HIV during ART is the paramount scientific
question standing between standard of care treatment and cure. Aim 1 is directed at developing a
phylodynamic model of primary infection and the creation of the HIV reservoir. The model will be validated
against viral load and sequence data from the RV217 trial, the highest-resolution primary infection cohort
recorded (shared by Dr Rolland). Dr Reeves has recently published a model in Nature Communications that
suggests the majority of reservoir persistence is due to cellular proliferation of infected cells. Aim 2 is a logical
continuation of this work. Dr Reeves will model T cell subset and phylogenetic data (shared by Drs Hunt and
Siliciano) to refine the mechanism as predominantly homeostatic vs antigenic proliferation. For Aim 3 Dr
Reeves will use the phylodynamic model as a biomarker discovery tool for curative interventions including
latency reversing agents, anti-proliferative therapy, and gene therapy.
 Through accomplishing the aims of this proposal, Dr Reeves will address critical gaps in our knowledge
of the HIV reservoir’s persistence and provide a framework to study HIV cure regimens in silico. Ultimately, this
proposal will allow Dr Reeves to influence the future of HIV cure research as well as build a self-sustaining
program at the interface of mathematical modeling, immunology, and viral evolution."
10894907,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic herpesvirus associated with multiple cancers, including Burkitt
lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma and post-transplant lymphomas.
EBV-associated B-cell lymphomas occur at significantly higher frequency in the setting of HIV co-infection,
even with the use of antiretroviral therapy. AIDS-related lymphomas (ARLs) are most commonly diffuse large B
cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), followed by Burkitt lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), all frequently
associated with EBV infection. Each of these cancers is linked to a viral latency program that is used as EBV-
infected B-cells navigate the B-cell compartment to colonize memory cells, the reservoir for lifelong infection.
Yet, much remains to be learned about epigenetic mechanism that control viral oncoprotein expression, and
how this can ultimately be exploited in novel therapeutic approaches. We therefore recently performed
CRISPR and chemical genetic analysis to identify host factors that tightly regulate the expression of EBV
oncoproteins in B-cells. These analyses highlighted host DNA and histone methyltransferases with key roles in
regulation of EBV latency and lytic gene expression. Characterization of top screen hits revealed multiple
layers of EBV oncoprotein control, yet, how DNA and histone methyltransferases target specific EBV genomic
promoter sites remains largely unknown. In parallel, we integrated these studies with tumor genome mutation
analysis to identify host genes that are mutated at high frequency in EBV-infected and EBV-uninfected B-cell
lymphomas. These analyses recently identified that linker H1 histone genes, which are highly recurrent in B
cell lymphomas, are genetic driver mutations in lymphomagenesis. They also demonstrated that histone H1
mutation drives malignant transformation via three-dimensional genome reorganization, resulting in epigenetic
reprogramming and de-repression of developmentally silenced genes. Notably, our proteomic analysis
identified that EBV strongly downmodulates expression of multiple linker histone 1 isoforms, though it remains
unknown how this H1 subversion alters the viral and host genome landscape in EBV-associated lymphomas.
We hypothesize that germinal center microenvironment cues orchestrate B-cell epigenetic programs
that together with EBV oncoprotein effects on linker histone expression dictate tumor latency
programs. While immunological selective pressures also contribute to latency, we propose that T-follicular
helper signals and cell intrinsic factors control EBV latency patterns. Our specific aims are therefore to: 1)
Identify how key germinal center cytokines affect epigenetic writers to alter the EBV epigenome and dictate
latency program selection. 2) Identify dynamic histone H1 roles in EBV epigenome and latency program
regulation. 3) Define the relationship between B-cell differentiation state, epigenetic profile, and EBV latency
pattern in HIV+ DLBCL. Collectively, these studies address long-standing question in the EBV tumor virology
field and lay the foundation for novel therapeutic approaches to EBV-driven human malignancies."

I am currently a mentored assistant research scientist in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the
University of Iowa. My long-term goal is to establish an independent research program to improve outcomes
for women with ovarian and endometrial cancer through the safe delivery of effective and personalized
treatment regimens. I intend to pursue an independent tenure-track faculty position at a competitive research
institution, building upon my postdoctoral training in novel RNA-based therapeutics and current work in
personalized medicine for gynecologic cancers. The objective for my independent K22 research program is to
mechanistically distinguish between common missense p53 mutants and develop synthetic RNA-based
therapeutics to overcome the deleterious functions. Approximately 40-50% of all observed p53 mutations are
single nucleotide variants that result in missense mutations that change a single amino acid. Missense
mutations not only abrogate canonical DNA binding and interaction with co-factors, but also confer new
activities, including transcription of non-canonical targets and new in protein:protein interactions. Studies will
focus on endometrial and ovarian cancer given the widespread occurrence of p53 mutations in these cancer
types and the extremely poor 5-year survival of patients with p53 mutant cancers. I hypothesize that missense
mutations in p53 that result in protein hyperstabilization activate different transcriptomic signatures that can be
perturbed using novel RNA aptamers evolved to be specific for each mutant p53. This work leverages a highly
innovative strategy to isolate native p53 from patient-derived organoid (PDO) cultures, which allows for study
of p53 mutations in their endogenous environment. First, I will determine the mechanism(s) of survival and
chemoresistance for recurrent p53 mutants by calculating the DNA binding specificity native p53 mutants and
link this to genomic localization, gene regulation and chemosensitivity. This work includes a novel approach to
isolate p53 mutant proteins from PDO models to capture the native protein conformation, posttranslational
modifications and splice isoforms. Next, I will restore chemosensitivity in models with p53 mutants by
perturbing the deleterious activity of individual p53 mutants with mutant-specific RNA aptamers. These studies
will provide the first comprehensive assessment of the functional consequences of a large panel of p53
mutants using native protein and establish the feasibility of developing aptamer-based tools that inactivate p53
mutants. This project merges my graduate work in cell signaling, postdoctoral training in RNA aptamer-based
therapeutics and more recent work in translational studies of gynecologic cancers. With funding from this K22
award and my multi-disciplinary collaborators, I will be well-equipped to establish an independent research
program to improve outcomes for women with gynecologic cancer."

David Artis: 1. Identification of microbially-derived signals that alter the maturation and function of microglia, and
2. Alterations in microglial function that regulate experience-dependent synaptic refinement. The proposed
experiments and multi-faceted training plan will impart the candidate with a unique combination of skills that will
position him to transition into a successful independent career as a physician-scientist studying the contribution
of peripheral organ system dysfunction to alterations in cognitive function and affective states.
Alterations in the microbiota have been associated with multiple neuropsychiatric disorders in small-scale human
correlational studies, and animal studies utilizing germ-free (GF) mice lacking a microbiota from birth, or animals
rendered acutely dysbiotic by antibiotic treatment have demonstrated defects in the normal physiology of multiple
CNS regions and cell populations including synapse-level changes in the context of experience. Amongst
affected cell populations, the CNS tissue-resident macrophage known as microglia have been shown by us and
others to be heavily altered in the absence of a normal microbiota. Given the known importance of microglia in
regulating the formation, stability, and plasticity of synapses within both the developing and adult mouse brain,
they likely represent an important conduit through which microbiota-derived signals regulate normal experience-
dependent synaptic plasticity and ultimately animal behavior. The goal of my proposal is to investigate the role
of the microbiota in modulating microglial function in the adult brain. Specifically, this proposal investigates how
changes to the microbiome alter microglial-neuronal interaction by: 1. Identifying the microbially-derived small
molecule signals by which the microbiome alter mouse and human microglial maturation and function in vitro; 2.
Testing the role of these metabolites in regulating microglial-dependent synaptic refinement in a model of
experience-dependent plasticity. Collectively, these experiments provide novel insight into the role of the
microbiome and its metabolites in regulating microglial function including synaptic refinement."

deficits such as dementia. Older TBI patients are at a higher risk for worsening of outcomes than their younger
counterparts (Chou et al., 2018; Early et al., 2020; Morganti et al., 2016; Ritzel et al., 2019), despite the higher
risk and worse outcomes, there are no targeted therapies targeted for this susceptible population, and only a
few publications looking at therapeutics for this vulnerable population. This is compounded by data suggesting
that older subjects may show less responsiveness to therapeutic interventions (Tajiri et al., 2014) which may
indicate that aged individuals will require optimized treatments that differ from young. We have identified a
therapy exosomes from human adipose derived stem cells (hASC exo) (Patel et al., 2018) that have a
therapeutic window up to at least 48 hours post injury in young rodents (see preliminary data). The extended
therapeutic window of hASC exo would be a major advancement over most current experimental therapeutics,
with a treatment window of only hours and not days. To move this promising therapy forward we must address
critical gaps in our knowledge regarding hASC exo’s mechanism of action, and effectiveness of the
intervention in diverse age populations. Our hypothesis is that a major action of these hASC exosomes is to
modulate the secondary immune response to injury by interacting with the immune system. It is already well
established that in aged rodents aged there is an exaggerated response of innate immune cells to the injury.
Our preliminary data demonstrates the efficacy of hASC exo to improve behavior and reduce inflammatory
markers following CCI is modified in aged rodents . Thus, an unanswered question is how aging impacts
the response to treatment, and specifically treatment with hASC exosomes."

Glial cells play an essential role in defending brain health and managing neuronal stress and damage.
Neurodegeneration triggers robust glial immune responses, including changes in cytoskeletal dynamics, glial
cell migration, and increased phagocytic activity. Timely removal and degradation of degenerating axons and
neuronal debris by glia confers neuroprotection in the brain. Despite the importance of glial responses to axon
injury, we still know surprisingly little about how damaged neurons invoke immune reactions in glial cells. What
signals are released from degenerating neurons? What prompts the release of these injury cues? Finally, how
are these signals translated by glia to carry out efficient immune responses to damage?
 We are using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a tractable model to investigate the immune
communication relays that exist between neurons and glial cells in vivo. The fly nervous system contains
distinct glial subtypes that are molecularly and functionally similar to vertebrate glia. Moreover, well-established
axotomy assays in the adult olfactory system and the adult wing reveal that Drosophila axons undergo a
classic Wallerian degeneration (WD) program, which includes increased intra-axonal calcium waves, axon
fragmentation, and subsequent clearance by phagocytic glia. Notably, our lab has recently shown that axon
degeneration triggers activation of the insulin-like signaling (ILS) pathway in reactive ensheathing glia, which,
in turn, elicits essential glial immune responses, including transcriptional upregulation of immune genes (e.g.
the engulfment receptor Draper) and phagocytic activity. We hypothesize that neuropeptide-containing dense
core vesicles (DCVs) are broadly released from severed axons to trigger immune responses in local glial cells.
Here, we propose to use static and live confocal imaging, transcriptional profiling, and newly developed in vivo
reporters to investigate how neuropeptide signaling between neurons and glia informs glial immune responses
to nerve injury. Specifically, we will 1) monitor DCV dynamics and release in adult severed nerves, 2) utilize
novel single transcript labeling methods to visualize local translation of immune mRNA transcripts in glial
extensions at sites of injury, and 3) determine how neuropeptide signaling between discrete glial subtypes
ensures that glial responses to degenerating axons are properly carried out. Together, these findings will offer
exciting molecular and cellular insight into how neuropeptide signaling between neurons and glia govern
immune responses in both acute and chronic degenerative conditions."

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in the bone marrow microenvironment (BM-ME) with distinctive low oxygen tension. In contrast to the physiological status of HSCs in the BM (~1-5% O2), almost all ex vivo HSC studies have been conducted by collecting and processing BM in ambient air with extra-physiologic oxygen tension (~21% O2). Our previous work evaluating normal mouse BM and human cord blood, revealed a significant loss in the number and function of HSCs upon exposure to extraphysiologic oxygen shock/stress (EPHOSS) in ambient air. HSCs collected and processed under physioxia demonstrate higher engraftment and self-repopulating capacity than HSCs collected and processed under ambient air. The exposure to ambient air (~21% O2) and sudden oxygenation induces rapid differentiation of HSCs to multipotent and committed HPCs. While these paradigm changing findings have been exciting to report; the molecular basis behind this distinction are poorly understood but have the potential to improve hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for both malignant and non-malignant diseases as well as for gene therapy and/or correction of diseased HSCs. One example of how diseased HSCs result in bone marrow failure (BMF) involves Fanconi Anemia (FA), a rare genetic disease characterized by BMF and cancer. BM from FA patients and from fanca-/- and fancc-/- mice are defective in HSC function, which compromises their use in human and mouse HCT and gene therapy to correct genetic defects causing FA. We provide strong preliminary data to suggest that fanca-/- and fancc-/- HSCs when collected and processed in physioxia (i.e., hypoxia) show a profound increase in the recovery of long-term (LT)-HSCs compared to those harvested in normoxia (i.e., ambient air). Whether these HSCs are functionally more competent than those harvested in normoxia will be one of the focuses of this application. Additionally, we have identified novel antioxidant pathways in hypoxic HSCs, which we will try to manipulate in FA HSCs to improve HSC function. Lastly, we have established the Spacer-Nick-mediated gene correction approach, which barely induces double-stranded breaks and DNA damage response in cells. We hypothesize that implementing the Spacer-Nick-mediated gene correction approach under hypoxia and in fancc-/- HSCs lacking stress pathways will be more efficient and, importantly, will enhance the function(s) of gene corrected HSCs in vitro and in vivo."

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes frequently inactivated in cancer, particularly in ovarian and
breast cancers. Despite recent advances in therapy, many patients with BRCA1/2-deficient cancers eventually
die of the disease and, therefore, new treatment options are needed. The goal of this proposal is to develop a
novel targeted therapy against BRCA1/2-deficient cancers that combines high doses of tetrahydrofolate (THF)
and vitamin C (VC) to generate metabolic genotoxins in cancer cells. The rationale of the proposed strategy
stems from the recent discovery that high doses of THF, the active form of folate, oxidize generating the potent
crosslinker formaldehyde (FA), which kills cells deficient in DNA crosslink repair such as BRCA1/2-mutant cells.
In addition, preliminary data show that vitamin C (VC) promotes the selective killing of BRCA1/2-deficient cells
by THF. VC and THF synergize at generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting formaldehyde and
ROS generation might drive the cytotoxic effects in BRCA-mutant cells. In contrast, VC reduces THF toxicity in
normal tissues in mice, which allows the administration of higher doses of THF. Furthermore, treatment with THF
and VC in combination prolongs the survival of mice with BRCA1-mutant tumors. Based on these findings, this
proposal aims to: (1) Understand the mechanism of selectivity of the vitamin combination against BRCA1/2-
deficient cells, by using isogenic cell lines, metabolic tools, DNA damage assays and molecular and cell biology
techniques. (2) Characterize the interaction between THF and VC in mice, by employing metabolomics,
ultrasensitive mass-spectrometry analysis of DNA adducts, immunohistochemistry and infrared microscopy. (3)
Assess the efficacy of THF/VC therapy against BRCA-mutant tumors in mice, by using orthotopic syngeneic
models of ovarian and breast cancer and measuring the impact of THF/VC in tumor growth and overall survival.
By using state-of-the-art tools and cancer models, this project could provide the foundations of a novel
therapeutic strategy for the treatment of BRCA1/2-mutant cancers. In addition, it could support an unconventional
approach of harnessing metabolism for cancer therapy that manipulates metabolism to generate metabolic
genotoxins in cancer cells."

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is an incurable, progressive chronic respiratory disease, and a
leading cause of death in the United States. COPD is a heterogenous syndrome, characterized by diverse clinical
and pathologic manifestations of COPD that vary amongst susceptible individuals. Growing evidence suggests
COPD is characterized by the presence of aberrant cell populations that can be identified using single-cell
sequencing technologies. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide a deeper understanding of how
these aberrant cells communicate with their microenvironment and identify novel strategies for therapeutic
intervention. Our overarching hypothesis is that COPD heterogeneity is due to aberrant cell-cell and cell-matrix
communication that occur to varying degrees in susceptible individuals. In Aim 1, we will identify aberrant cell-
cell signaling by performing network level analyses of a newly created dataset of single-nuclear RNA sequencing
data generated with frozen lung tissue samples from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC). We will
then use spatial transcriptomics from the same samples to provide spatial context to these signaling pathways
and refine our understanding of aberrant cell-cell signaling in COPD. In Aim 2, we will assess cell-matrix
communication networks by performing proteomic profiling of decellularized lung tissue samples from the same
LTRC samples and perform network level analyses to assess cell-matrix interactions that are enriched in disease
or correlate with disease traits. By assessing spatial cell-cell interactions, and aberrant cell-matrix networks, we
hope to identify novel therapeutic targets for COPD.
This proposal is a response to the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) to support meritorious exploratory
research relevant to the NHLBI mission using the existing biospecimen collections that are stored in the NHLBI
Biologic Specimen Repository (Biorepository), thereby maximizing the scientific value of the stored collections,
and providing researchers with an opportunity to generate preliminary data for subsequent research proposals.
Findings from this proposal will be utilized for further mechanistic investigation of potential therapeutic targets."

The advent of non-factor replacement therapies like the bispecific antibody emicizumab has revolutionized care
for previously untreated patients with hemophilia A as well as those with and without inhibitors (neutralizing anti-
factor VIII (FVIII) antibodies). However, these therapies are only effective as a prophylaxis to prevent bleeding
and do not treat bleeds or provide protection against bleeding during major surgeries, resulting in the continued
need for replacement FVIII therapy. Thus, several critical concerns surrounding the immediate and long-term
management of these patients, and especially those with inhibitors still remain in this new treatment era. It is
recognized that patients can generate different immune responses to FVIII: (1) no antibodies, (2) non-neutralizing
antibodies, (3) transient inhibitors (inhibitors that resolve without the need of therapeutic interventions and
despite continued FVIII treatment), or (4) low or high inhibitor titers that persist or wane to undetectable levels
when FVIII treatment is withdrawn. However, why patients form distinct inhibitor responses remains an enigma.
Our preclinical data suggest that differential inhibitor responses maybe due to the engagement of distinct B cell
pathways of antibody production, with transient or waning inhibitors resulting from the development of an
extrafollicular B cell response to FVIII and persistent inhibitors from a classical germinal center B cell response.
Corroborating this, clinical reports indicate that some patients with hemophilia A fail to generate an anamnestic
response to FVIII and demonstrate a loss of inhibitor titers in the absence of FVIII treatment. As germinal center
B cell responses are responsible for the production of life-long immunity that comes in the form of memory B
cells and long-lived plasma cells, we hypothesize that the B cell response to FVIII in patients with waning
inhibitors occurs through an extrafollicular B cell process, while persistent inhibitors are generated through the
long proposed classical germinal center response. The current proposal is thus focused on gaining a mechanistic
understanding of the extrafollicular B cell response to FVIII in patients with severe hemophilia A, the relationship
between the type of B cell response a patient develops and their inhibitor status, and factors that associate with
the formation of an extrafollicular or germinal B cell response to FVIII by evaluating the immune response to
FVIII in severe hemophilia A patients with a history of inhibitors."

 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has proposed to end the HIV epidemic in the
 United States with the ambitious goal of 75% reduction in new HIV infections in 5 years and 90% reduction in 10
 years targeting communities hardest hit by the epidemic. Cuyahoga County, where Case Western Reserve
 University (CWRU) is located, is one of the 48 highest burden counties. CWRU and University of Pittsburgh (Pitt)
 will create an Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Scientific Working Group (SWG2) within the RUSTBELT CFAR.
 The overarching goal of the EHE SWG2 is to promote interdisciplinary collaborations that result in successful
 applications for new HIV prevention and implementation research projects. Pitt has a diverse portfolio of
 successful biomedical and behavioral research with active community engagement including initiatives such as
 AIDS-Free Pittsburgh. Recently, Allegheny County has significantly reduced its HIV incidence from 139 cases
 in 2015 to 85 cases in 2018. CWRU has a strong relationship with local public health officials and the HIV
 community, in which formal and informal channels have been maintained for over 19 years with deep roots to
 community inclusion via public and private organizations and numerous community events and educational
 meetings. EHE SWG2 will build on the regional, cultural, and demographic similarities between Pittsburgh and
 Cleveland to promote robust HIV prevention research, practice, and research training. The EHE SWG2 has two
 aims: (1) Expand academic/community/practitioner partnerships to develop research programs that identify gaps
 across EHE pillars in Cleveland and Pittsburgh. EHE SWG2 will bring together researchers, community
 stakeholders, and nontraditional partners to address each of the pillars of the National Plan to End the HIV
 Epidemic. SWG leadership will provide support to investigators to implement an array of successful community-
 based HIV prevention and implementation research programs. This initiative will produce joint Pitt/CWRU
 investigative teams and generate valuable pilot data for additional End the HIV Epidemic supplementary
 proposals and other R21/R34 mechanisms. (2) Facilitate new EHE implementation research projects that align
 with the pillars of the NIH HIV strategy in communities disproportionately impacted by HIV. EHE SWG2 will
 develop productive interactions with RUSTBELT CFAR Cores, Sex & Gender SWG1, and the Inter-CFAR
 Implementation Science Working Group to develop grant proposals for a robust EHE research and practice,
 leveraging each institution’s strengths to facilitate a new, dynamic program of HIV prevention implementation
 and research. The EHE SWG2 will utilize an empowered community framework for shared decision-making in
 EHE research prioritization, design, implementation, and dissemination and support the development of new
 research initiatives and advocacy for local- and state-level policy changes. By focusing its resources on
 communities most affected by HIV and developing an effective HIV prevention research infrastructure, the EHE
 SWG2 represents a key first step on the path to ending the HIV epidemic in the rustbelt region."

Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a re-emerging mosquito-borne alphavirus that causes a debilitating
encephalitic illness in humans. About a third of human cases of EEEV infection die and many survivors have
long-term, debilitating neurologic problems. The virus is maintained in an enzootic cycle between Culiseta
melanura mosquitoes and avian hosts but can be transmitted to humans and horses by
some Aedes, Coquillettidia, and Culex species. The infection is unusual in humans but increasing in frequency
in recent years, likely secondary to climate changes, vector expansion, and other uncharacterized factors. EEEV
also is regarded as a potential bioterrorism threat due to spread via aerosol route. Despite the highly pathogenic
nature of the virus, no specific treatment or vaccine for EEEV is available. A primary goal of this project is to
define the molecular, genetic, immunologic, and structural characteristics of ultra-potent neutralizing human
mAbs with broad activity in vivo against EEEV. Additional goals include defining the mechanistic correlates of
protection by these ultra-potent neutralizing mAbs and determining ways to optimize function and deliver to the
brain. In these studies, we will elucidate how antiviral Abs with exceptional inhibitory activity exert their action in
cell culture and in vivo. The approach will include high efficiency isolation of human mAbs, coupled with
innovative antibody gene repertoire studies based on next-gen sequencing. Several hypotheses will be tested,
including the concept that ultra-potent neutralizing activity results from features of both the antibodies (selection
of optimal V-D-J clonotypes and accumulation of critical somatic mutations) and the antigen (binding to
quaternary epitopes on multiple adjacent envelope proteins and blockade of structural transitions critical for virus
entry or release). We also will apply new technologies for receptor-mediated transfer of molecules across the
blood-brain barrier using engineered sequence changes in the Fc region. Although our focus is to understand
how and why ultra-potent human mAbs inhibit EEEV, the studies likely will be relevant to general principles of
antibody neutralization of many different encephalitic viruses. In addition to defining the molecular and structural
basis of Ab neutralization of EEEV and deploying new strategies for delivery of biologics to the brain, these
studies will generate a group of fully human mAbs that can prevent and treat EEEV infection, which could be
developed in the near future as a possible therapeutic for humans. Studies in this project, while targeted against
EEEV, likely will inform future Ab-based and/or vaccine efforts against other arboviruses that cause human brain
infections. We have assembled a unique group of investigators, including a human Ab expert, a molecular
virologist with experience in Ab-virus interactions, an animal model and pathogenesis expert with specific
expertise in encephalitic alphaviruses, including EEEV, and brain-targeting scientists to pursue these studies."

The expansion of follicular helper (Tfh) cells and related subpopulations is correlated with the severity of human
lupus disease and is shared by all lupus-prone mouse models. However, the mechanisms for the expansion of
Tfh cells in lupus are largely unknown. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to shed new light on the mechanisms
that are responsible for Tfh cell expansion in lupus using innovative cellular and molecular approaches based
on the obtained data from the B6.Sle1.Sle2.Sle3 triple congenic (TC) murine model of lupus. Accordingly, we
have identified genetic, as well as microbial and metabolic determinants that modulate lupus Tfh cell expansion.
Transferring the perturbed gut microbiota of lupus mice into mouse host crucially contributed to Tfh cell
expansion. Additionally, an altered tryptophan (Trp) metabolism also enhanced Tfh cell expansion, which was
reduced by manipulating dietary Trp levels in mice. Finally, inhibiting glycolysis with 2-deoxi-D-glucose (2DG),
or glutaminolysis with 6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) functionally diminished lupus Tfh cell differentiation.
Our hypothesis is that the expansion of Tfh cells implicated in lupus integrates cues from susceptibility genes,
dysregulated microbiome and environmental metabolites. In support of this hypothesis, our data demonstrate
that TC Tfh cells possess a novel metabolic gene signature, potentially driving the autoreactive Tfh cell expansion
directed by a unique metabolic flux. Thus, we propose combining the analyses of Tfh cell transcriptome and
metabolome in response to variations of the aforementioned cues as a means to elucidate the involved molecular
mechanisms, singly or in combination, impacting the fate of Tfh cells in lupus. We also propose to investigate
the effects of genetic and environmental determinants functionally affecting Tfh cells on two B cell subsets,
CD11c+Tbet+ B cells (ABCs) and IgA+ B cells. To proceed, the following Specific Aims are proposed. 1. To
explore the mechanisms by which lupus susceptibility genes modulate the Tfh cell transcriptome and
metabolome in the two unrelated TC and (NZW x BXSB.Yaa)F1 lupus models. 2. To identify the impact of
environmental factors on the Tfh transcriptome and metabolome in TC mice. And 3. To elucidate the molecular
mechanisms implicated in the expansion of Tfh cells in lupus patients. Obtained results from these mechanistic
experiments will be the first in-depth investigation of Tfh cell expansion directed by environmental and genetic
determinants, which may be reprogrammed for a sustainable therapeutic strategy to perhaps improve lupus
patients' health."

new and robust way to create molecular atlases of the heterogenous neuropathologies observed in
human brain tissue, (2) define how the molecular underpinnings of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary
tangles overlap with pathways implicated in contributory neuropathologies to inform more precise
development of experimental therapies; and (3) deploy multiomic tools to document cell-type specific
molecular changes between normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease in well-defined microanatomical
regions so changes in the metabolome, lipidome, proteome, and transcriptome can be attributed to the
correct cell types and microenvironment. With this suite of technologies, advanced data analysis
capabilities, and prior experience in developing atlases of healthy-for-age human tissues, this team will
generate datasets with unprecedented detail and the potential to drive molecular discovery. To
accomplish these aims, we assembled an interactive and established team of investigators, covering
complementary expertise in Alzheimer’s disease, cell biology, analytical chemistry, and data science;
and with direct in-house access to advanced instrumentation and facilities. We believe that our spatially
resolved and molecularly comprehensive approach will lead to improved mechanistic understanding of
Alzheimer’s disease and that these insights could inform better treatment options."

 The fusion of CBFA2/RUNX1 partner transcriptional co-repressor 3 (CBFA2T3, also known as ETO2) and
GLIS family zinc finger 2 (GLIS2) proteins is the most recurrent (30%) alternation in pediatric de novo acute
megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL). For infants and young children (<3 years of age) harboring ETO2-GLIS2,
outcomes are among the worst of all pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subtypes, with poor responses to
induction therapy, high incidence of relapse (~90%), and dismal 5-year survival rates (<20%). Genome
sequencing studies have shown the ETO2-GLIS2 fusion and epigenetic regulation to be key drivers of the
disease. For instance, transcriptional deregulation in this AML subtype was linked to the cooperative binding of
ETO2-GLIS2 to H3K27ac (histone H3, acetyl-lysine amino acid position 27) enriched super-enhancer (SE)
chromatin. In leukemic blasts, ETO2-GLIS2 induces formation of unique leukemia-specific SE (neo-SE)
elements that would be distantly located from their canonical binding sites in normal megakaryocyte (MK)
progenitors. While ETO2-GLIS2 fusion is considered to impact leukemic properties by imbalance of ERG-GATA1
transcription factors (TFs) and enhancer activity in a single oncogenic “hit”, detailed mechanisms by which the
fusion protein rearranges chromatin architecture to deregulate transcriptional programs remain elusive.
 Mediator (MED) proteins are known to assemble transcriptional coactivators distal to the RNA polymerase II
binding site to regulate gene expression. Specifically, in leukemic cells, the MED12 subunit or its MK-lineage
paralog MED12L of the MED-kinase module was reported to co-recruit regulatory transcription factors (e.g.,
bromodomain 4, ERG, p300, GATA2) at H3K27ac-enriched SE elements. Moreover, somatic mutations of
MED12L or amplifications of chr3q, which harbors the gene, also have been reported as novel oncogenic drivers
in squamous cell carcinoma and prostate cancer respectively. MED12L is found overexpressed and controlled
by the ETO2-GLIS2 bound SE in this AML subtype. Understanding the role of MED12L in enhancer mechanisms
could provide insight into novel treatment approaches.
 Based on rigorous preliminary studies, we hypothesize that ETO2-GLIS2 exploits focal chromatin features
to develop oncogenic neo-SEs, favoring leukemic growth, and that MED12L potentiates formation and
transcriptional linkage of these neo-SE elements to induce leukemic gene expression. We will test our hypothesis
by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Determine how ETO2-GLIS2 alters chromatin architecture to facilitate
leukemia-specific transcriptional programs and (2) Determine the degree to which MED12L contributes to the
global chromatin remodeling and formation of neo-SE."

 Persistent pain develops following nerve injury when primary sensory neurons show complex, activity- 
dependent plasticity and ectopic discharges. It is often refractory to existing treatments and associated with 
adverse health outcomes. The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is a collection of several types of sensory neuronal 
cell bodies and satellite glia which acts as the initial point of modulation of action potentials from potentially 
noxious stimuli to second order spinal cord neurons. Epigenetic variability is known to cause dysregulation of 
gene transcription which may modulate nociception to alter an individual’s susceptibility for persistent pain. 
Chromatin accessibility regulates transcription factor binding to cis-regulatory regions and subsequent changes 
in gene expression. Therefore, understanding how changes in chromatin accessibility at these regulatory regions 
modulate transcription factor binding in chronic pain states would help to identify regulatory loci in the DRG. 
Following peripheral nerve injury, regenerative mechanisms are activated to recover lost motor, sensory, and 
autonomic functions. Neuropathic pain develops when these mechanisms promote maladaptive neural 
connectivity that becomes electrically hyperexcitable and generates spontaneous and evoked action potentials. 
How these processes become activated to promote pain in the absence of nerve injury is unknown. 
 We have completed the first comprehensive map of changes in chromatin accessibility with matching RNA- 
seq in the DRG using two well-studied models of persistent pain – surgical ligation of the sciatic nerve (CCI) and 
hind paw inflammation (CFA). We identified differential expression of members of the plexin-semaphorin 
pathway with changes in chromatin accessibility at their putative cis-regulatory regions. This pathway generates 
attractive or repulsive cues to reunite with its distal, denervated segment. PlexinA2 is a member of a large family 
of receptors that bind to semaphorin, which then heterodimerizes with Nrp1 to form a functional neuronal receptor 
that activates Rnd1. The role of PlexinA2, Nrp1 and Rnd1 in persistent pain remains unclear. However, altered 
Plxna2 expression during development disrupts normal peripheral nervous system morphology. We hypothesize 
that altered epigenetic regulation of Plxna2, Nrp1 and Rnd1 expression in sensory neurons plays a functional 
role in axon guidance and promotes persistent pain states. In addition, we hypothesize that changes to the 
sensory environment during neuronal development may epigenetically prime nociceptors to promote altered 
nociceptive thresholds later in life. We will pursue the following Specific Aims to test our hypotheses: (1) To 
determine how chromatin topology affects Plxna2 expression and genes involved in its forward signaling in DRG 
neurons in neuropathic and inflammatory pain conditions, (2) To understand how modulation of the Plxna2-Nrp1- 
Rnd1 axis in DRG neurons alters neurite structure and pain behaviors, (3) To determine the effects of early-life 
stress on Plxna2 signaling in the dorsal root ganglion following nerve injury in later life."

assessments of all projects, Core Facilities, and the career development-mentoring plan. In addition, the
Administrative Core will be responsible for budget management, External Advisory Committee (EAC) meetings,
symposia, and yearly reports to NIGMS. Aim 2: Implement an enhanced, result-oriented, multi-tier mentoring
strategy to accelerate the career development of the Junior Investigators. The Administrative Core will implement
an enhanced mentoring model that identifies two external and one internal mentor and one peer advisor
(mentoring team) for each Junior Investigator. The mentoring team will address future research directions,
organization and presentation of manuscripts, strategies for writing competitive proposals, and proposal review
before submission. Furthermore, Junior Investigators will engage with CDTSPC's Translational Science Liaison
and receive mentoring on the translational aspects of their projects. Aim 3: Enhance biomedical research
infrastructure at NDSU. The Administrative Core will competitively recruit a replacement once a Junior
Investigator graduates as an independent investigator through a campus-wide proposal solicitation, external
peer review, recommendation of the EAC, followed by NIH approval. Aim 4: Accomplish the self-sustaining
status of CDTSPC. All investigators will compete for extramural research grants from federal and non-federal
resources in the competitive field of cancer biology. In addition, the Administrative core will ensure timely
completion of the CDTSPC milestones."
10883673,"Project Summary
There are many challenges to securing significant funding from federal agencies, particularly for junior faculty
members. A major obstacle for translational and pre-clinical researchers is a lack of access to comprehensive
data analysis support. In Phase I of the COBRE Center for Diagnostic and Therapeutic Strategies in Pancreatic
Cancer (CDTSPC), the Biostatistics Core was established to serve as a networking, training, and consulting
resource for junior faculty conducting research on pancreatic cancer, as well as for other scholars on campus
seeking to form collaborative partnerships with data scientists. In the Phase II continuation of this project, the
(newly re-named) Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (B2C) will continue to play an integral role in the CDTSPC
by providing high-quality, comprehensive study design and data analysis to all researchers of the CDTSPC and
North Dakota State University. Core personnel will assist CDTSPC investigators with all statistical aspects of
their translational and pre-clinical pancreatic cancer research projects in all stages of the process, increasing the
likelihood of CDTSPC researchers securing federally-funded research grants by ensuring properly designed and
well-powered experiments. Securing major funding is essential for the career advancement of CDTSPC Junior
Investigators and the Core, whose sustainability is realized through the receipt of competitive federal funding.
As the only Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core specializing in pancreatic cancer research in the region, the
B2C will also provide support for projects involving analysis beyond the traditional statistical techniques of the
bench and clinical research into other emerging areas of “big data” research, including bioinformatics, artificial
intelligence, and machine learning. For Phase II, the B2C Core aims are (1) to proactively assist in the statistical
design and implementation of all types of research, with an emphasis on translational and pre-clinical pancreatic
cancer research and (2) to assist in data analysis and reporting of post-experiment data. The B2C is uniquely
positioned to facilitate interdisciplinary and multi-paradigmatic research. The B2C faculty members have a wide
range of expertise in study design and data analysis methods and extensive experience in collaborating with
researchers in pancreatic cancer and many other areas of research. Using this expertise, B2C staff will assist
COBRE investigators with their projects, leading to advanced knowledge and treatment of pancreatic cancer,
and will meet the crucial need of reliable data analysis support to researchers at NDSU."
10883674,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal human malignancies, with a five-year
survival rate of 10.8%. Lack of efficient strategies to achieve cytotoxic concentrations of chemotherapeutics in
the tumor tissue and the tumor's innate resistance to chemotherapy are the significant barriers in improving
treatment outcomes for PDAC. Thus, new approaches for tumor-selective delivery of chemotherapeutics can
enhance the therapeutic efficacy while minimizing chemotherapy-associated toxicities. Unfortunately, current
nanocarrier systems primarily rely on the inefficient passive accumulation in the tumor. Here we propose a new
approach for treating PDAC with a combination of a novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, entinostat, and
a leading chemotherapeutic agent, oxaliplatin, at their synergistic ratio. The proposed studies will evaluate
nanoengineered MSC as a drug delivery platform to selectively accumulate cytotoxic agents in pancreatic
tumors. Based on the existing literature and our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that MSCs-mediated tumor-
targeted delivery of oxaliplatin and entinostat at their synergistic ratio would significantly reduce pancreatic tumor
growth and enhance the efficacy without acute toxicity. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following Aims.
Aim 1: Formulate drug-loaded nano-MSCs and determine their cellular efficacy. Our preliminary studies
demonstrate a dose-dependent synergistic therapeutic interaction between free oxaliplatin and entinostat in an
in vitro model of PDAC. We will encapsulate oxaliplatin and entinostat separately in the surface-functionalized
polymeric nanoparticles. Nanoparticles will be characterized for their particle size, surface charge, drug loading,
and in vitro drug release. The time- and dose-dependent drug loading capacity of MSCs and drug release rate
and mechanism from nanoengineered MSCs will also be evaluated. Also, both nanoparticle formulation and
nanoengineering protocols will be optimized to improve the drug loading capacity of MSCs without affecting their
native phenotype, viability, or migratory behavior. Finally, we will determine the synergistic ratio of entinostat and
oxaliplatin-loaded MSCs to kill PDAC cells. Based on our preliminary results, the working hypothesis for this Aim
is that the nanoengineered MSCs will enable sustained release of oxaliplatin without introducing resistance,
ensuring enhanced tumor cell killing.
Aim 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of nano-MSCs using an orthotopic mouse model of PDAC. First, we will
determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, acute and subchronic toxicities
of nanoengineered MSCs in an orthotopic mouse model of PDAC. Using this optimized dosing strategy, we will
determine the therapeutic efficacy of oxaliplatin-loaded nanoengineered MSCs alone and combined with
entinostat-loaded MSCs using an orthotopic mouse model of PDAC. We will conduct detailed histopathology of
the pancreas and other vital organs in necropsy tumor-bearing mice."
10883675,"Project Summary
The common approaches in cancer treatment involve drugs that act on DNA or proteins involved in cell
proliferation. Regrettably, such drugs are (a) not selective to tumor cells causing damage in normal cells, and
(b) ineffective in killing nondividing tumor cells, which can cause tumor relapse after the initial remission, leading
to therapy failure. In our search for a protein that can kill tumor cells regardless of theirs proliferating status, we
noted that the Protein Complex of Secretory Vesicle I (COPI) is involved in retrograde transport of proteins in
the ER-Golgi secretory pathway, endosome maturation, and autophagy homeostasis. Its depletion leads to
abortive autophagy, ER stress, unfolded protein response (UPR), and apoptosis. Almost all of the COPI
components are expressed at the same levels in both normal and tumor cells. However, the coatomer protein
complex I subunit 2 (COPZ2) is drastically downregulated in the tumor cells. Interestingly, in normal cells, the
inhibition of the coatomer protein complex subunit 1 (COPZ1, an isoform of COPZ2) does not affect COPI
function. However, the silencing of COPZ1 and COPZ2 simultaneously led to the loss of COPI function and,
consequently, cell death. Then, COPZ2 deficiency indicates tumor cells' dependency on COPZ1. Therefore,
selective COPZ1 inhibition in COPZ2-deficient tumor cells can potentially overcome the therapy failure problem.
We will design a promising lead compound to inhibit COPZ1 in COPZ2-deficient tumor cells, selectively killing
tumor cells over healthy cells. Our first-generation synthesized COPZ1 inhibitors (based on virtual screening)
showed good selectivity against PDAC. Our central objective is to develop the second-generation small-
molecule-based COPZ1 inhibitors that can kill PDAC cells selectively over normal cells by merging molecular
modeling, chemical Synthesis, cellular mechanistic studies, and animal experiments. Specifically, we will
improve COPZ1 selectivity by conjugating small organic molecules to interact with a secondary binding site. We
hypothesize that the tumor cell death induced by selective inhibition of COPZ1 could lead the proliferating and
nondividing tumor cells to apoptosis but not normal cells."
10883679,"Intratumoral perfusion has long been recognized as a critical issue in both clinical diagnosis and therapy of dense solid cancerous tumors. In such context, a first-principles mechanics-based model that can quantify perfusion in the intratumoral extracellular spaces as a function of the tumor vasculature shapes and the fiber packing fraction in the stroma – can launch new avenues in cancer diagnosis and care. With that vision, the proposed project will integrate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tracking with theoretical fluid mechanics analysis to generate an in silico tumor uptake modeling framework, that can operate over a wide parametric space. The test geometries will be based off computed tomography (CT) scans of human pancreatic tumors implanted in mice. The project will also design supplementary physical experiments in microfluidic setups and artificial tumor spheroids to benchmark and validate the proposed in silico approach. With use of mean continuum-level transport frameworks such as Darcy's Law and Starling model still a go-to resort for basic fluids modeling of intratumoral uptake quantification, the proposed CFD-informed advanced theoretical fluid mechanics approach to parameterize tumor perfusion based on tumor geometry and intratumoral stress will constitute this project's key contribution to the literature. The long-term objective of the project is as follows: in a clinical setting, the packing fraction of the fiber bundles inside the stroma can be readily assessed from image-processing the CT-slices from a tumor, it being logarithmically proportional to the intratumoral stress. The proposed numerical-theoretical model will be designed such as to project the tumoral uptake as a function of the packing fraction. This can trigger new diagnostic/therapeutic solutions with the fluidic transport trends inside a solid tumor predictable solely from the medical scans through assessment of the packing fraction. Our central hypothesis is: an integration of numerical computations with theoretical modeling can cover a diverse range of tumor microenvironments, rendering greater usability for the fluid mechanics tools. The resulting in silico framework will generate percolation data over a wide parameter space of tumor geometry features, e.g., the packing fraction inside the stroma and the local curvatures of blood vessels in the tumor vasculature. The work is structured around the following specific aims: (a) Aim 1 will numerically simulate multiphase transport inside the tumor vasculature, considering realistic blood vessel shapes and electrohydrodynamic effects on the mean transport, (b) Aim 2 will import from Aim 1 the plasma dynamics information at the endothelial openings and use the data as initial conditions to develop an integrative numerical-theoretical model for intratumoral transport through the extracellular matrix. The theoretical setup will invoke a convection-diffusion approach, where the boundary conditions on the local concentrations at the tumor inlet and near the necrotic core (deep into the tumor) will be fed from the numerical simulations. Finally, the in silico perfusion predictions will be compared against physical experiments performed in simplified bio-inspired microfluidic systems and with cell culture-derived realistic tumor spheroids embedded in a fluidic environment."

and they arise from several common antecedents. The Vermont Center for Cardiovascular and Brain Health
(VCCBH) COBRE at the University of Vermont (UVM) will address these diseases by supporting diverse
scientists from multiple disciplines who will work together to understand the pathobiology and molecular
epidemiology of these diseases. The Administrative Core (Core A), led by COBRE PIs Drs. Mary Cushman
and Mark Nelson, will be the heart of the VCCBH. It will provide administrative infrastructure and resources
that will produce the next generation of science leaders at UVM. Four junior faculty Project Directors (PDs) are
central to our effort. Core A will be accountable for key functions necessary for PD success, for Cores, for
engaging prospective PDs to replace the first cohort, and ultimately, for the future sustainability of the VCCBH.
Core A will foster innovation by creating a culture of openness, diversity, and collaboration. The Core will
administer an Interdisciplinary Strategic Mentoring Initiative to guide PDs to independent status (Aim 1).
Multidisciplinary mentoring teams will include two Senior Mentors, a Peer Mentor at the “first independent step”
career stage, and an experienced External Mentor. The Peer Mentor will benefit from this early opportunity to
provide faculty mentoring. The Core will develop and employ a comprehensive Faculty Development Program
(FDP) and Core facilities focused on PDs (Aim 2). The FDP will be highlighted by an institutionally supported
Pilot Grant Award program that will provide 4 grants of $200,000 each to pairs of junior faculty with different
research backgrounds. The capstone of the FDP will be an annual 2-day research symposium that will
highlight PD research and development of new projects. The Core will supervise development of new Cores in
“Study Design and Molecular Epidemiology” and “Customized Physiology and Imaging.” The Core will manage
the VCCBH budget, and assist and educate the PDs in budget management (Aim 3). Core A will coordinate
Internal and External Advisory Boards, develop outcome metrics, and provide semi-annual reports on these to
PDs, mentor teams, and Advisory Boards (Aim 4). Finally, the Core will provide communication across the
University and beyond on the Center's scientific expertise, Core resources and databases, and resources
generated by the VCCBH (data, specimens, study protocols, new techniques, and research results) (Aim 5). A
Communications Committee will include professionals from the Office of Communications of the Larner
College of Medicine and the UVM Foundation in order to promote philanthropy. By completing the Specific
Aims we will: (1) propel 4 early-career scientists to independence; (2) cultivate a pipeline of early career
scientists to fill PD positions as original PDs achieve funding; (3) recruit 5 new junior faculty to UVM to enter
our pipeline of prospective PDs; (4) promote collaboration amongst faculty and trainees working in
cardiovascular and neurovascular research across the colleges of UVM."

Cardiovascular disease, stroke and cognitive impairment / dementia are leading causes of death and disability,
and they arise from several common antecedents. The proposed Vermont Center for Cardiovascular and Brain
Health (VCCBH) COBRE at the University of Vermont will address these diseases employing collaborative
research. This will be conducted by diverse scientists from multiple disciplines working together to understand
the pathobiology and molecular epidemiology of these diseases in order to meet the public health challenges
presented by them. The Study Design and Molecular Epidemiology Core (CORE B) of the COBRE will
support the evolution of the Center's Project Directors to independent status. It will leverage three decades of
experience of the Laboratory for Clinical and Biochemistry Research at the University of Vermont, a leading
molecular epidemiology laboratory and home to a biorepository containing ~4.7 million samples from >100,000
research participants from many observational cohort studies and clinical trials. The core will equip the multi-
disciplinary Project Directors with the skills they need to conduct their research applying innovative study
designs and statistical analyses, and to translate their results from bench or clinical research settings to the
population research setting and back, regardless of their prior experience in epidemiology. Our philosophy is
that a Core should not only provide service but should train an investigator to be skilled in all of the key
elements that the Core provides. Thus, the Core will provide Project Directors with initial and ongoing formal
input on their study design and statistical approaches (Aim 1); advise Project Directors on all aspects of
biosample procurement, storage, and analysis, including optimizing and troubleshooting assay performance
(Aim 2); and support their transition to independence by connecting them with the resources of national
studies that will allow them to translate their research to clinical settings (Aim 3). The Core co-directors, Dr.
Neil Zakai and Dr. Peter Durda, along with Core biostatisticians, will guide the Project Directors. Dr. Zakai is a
hematologist and chronic disease epidemiologist with expertise in many types of study designs, biostatistical
approaches to complex data, and laboratory operations, while Dr. Durda has vast experience in molecular
laboratory methods and epidemiology. Together, Drs. Zakai and Durda will provide individualized assistance to
project directors and innovative workshops utilizing a flipped classroom approach. Services will also be offered
to Pilot Grant award recipients who will be supported by institutionally committed funds, to other investigators
in the Center's Pipeline development program of potential future Project Directors, and to the UVM research
community using a fee-for-service model. Over time the Core will become sustainable, serving the needs of the
cardiovascular and neurovascular research community at the University of Vermont."
10883715,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The new Customized Imaging and Physiology Core of the proposed Vermont Center for Cardiovascular and
Brain Health COBRE will be based upon transformation of a Neuroscience Imaging Core from a previous
COBRE (completed in 2016). It will meet the new needs of cutting-edge imaging investigation that will be
pursued by Project Directors (PDs) in the newly proposed COBRE. We will employ acquisition of needed
technology and renovation to accommodate its operation. The Customized Physiology and Imaging Core will
be designed to provide state-of-the-art imaging capabilities for live samples, including intravital, tissue and cell
preparations, as well as fixed samples. The new Cardiovascular and Brain Health COBRE will involve
extensive training in in vivo imaging and electrophysiology, and exploitation of genetically-encoded indicators
and optically-actuated probes by Project Directors. This Core will have high level pre- and post-experiment
technical and analytical support from Todd Clason, Dr. Grant Hennig and Dr. Tom Heppner. The new era of
high-resolution microscopy requires the flexibility to image in awake animals that may be undergoing specific
tasks, and to image in 3 dimensions over a wide range of time periods from milliseconds to weeks. To
accomplish this, this Core will advise and train investigators in the use of different types of state-of-art high
spatial and temporal resolution microscopy, electrophysiological techniques, and 3D printing for instrument
design and fabrication to respond to changing research needs, as well as in use and development of image
and electrophysiological analysis software. The goal of this Core is to equip the investigators with
imaging/electrophysiological, fabrication and analysis skills so that they are capable of adapting approaches to
solve complex problems. It is anticipated that this Core will greatly enhance the competitiveness of COBRE
Project Directors as well as campus-wide investigators in cardiovascular and brain health research. This Core
is unique in that PDs and other investigators, with support from highly accomplished Core personnel, will
acquire the skills to perform the experiments, modify imaging modalities, to fabricate project-specific
equipment, and to perform high level image analysis."

10896013,"FLOW CYTOMETRY & IMMUNE MONITORING: ABSTRACT
The Flow Cytometry & Immune Monitoring Shared Resource (FCIMSR) has served investigators of the
University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC) for more than 30 years. With the establishment of new cutting-
edge comprehensive immune monitoring services for basic and translational research, FCIMSR has been
renamed from the previous Flow Cytometry Shared Resource to highlight the full breadth of services now
available. The goal of FCIMSR is to offer UACC Members efficient and reliable flow cytometric and
comprehensive immune monitoring services with a high standard of quality control and in a cost-effective
manner. Led by Sara Centuori, PhD, and supported by three full-time staff, FCIMSR provides the knowledge
and expertise necessary to design experiments, develop new assays, perform flow cytometric functions, and
interpret data. FCIMSR is supported by chargebacks and UACC funding with the intent to prioritize cancer-
related services to UACC Members. In CY20, FCIMSR was utilized by 83 unique users, 55% of which were
UACC Members (86% with peer-reviewed extramural funding). The volume of FCIMSR usage has steadily

10896016,"TISSUE ACQUISITION & CELLULAR/MOLECULAR ANALYSIS: ABSTRACT
Personalized treatment of cancer is rapidly becoming a standard practice. Several factors contribute to the
uniqueness of a patient, including the individual’s genome, the genome and epigenome of the cancer, disease
presentation, gender, exposures, lifestyle, microbiome, and other comorbidities. The identification of specific
biomarkers, signaling pathways, immune cell signatures and genetic mutations within tumors underlies
molecular targeted therapies and new insights into cancer treatment. Projects require tissue samples of human
tumors, which may be implanted in mouse models or used for the generation of organotypic cultures that
duplicate the human disease progression and response to treatment. New drug treatments will first be tested in
these preclinical models using patient samples before developed therapeutic approaches reach clinical trials.
In addition, deciphering genetic alterations and aberrant and tumor-related genes are used for biomarkers for
targeted therapies that is unique to that patient. The overall goal of the Tissue Acquisition & Cellular/Molecular
Analysis Shared Resource (TACMASR) is to foster individualized approaches for the early detection and
therapy of cancers utilizing a new dimension of research pathology for biomarker/drug discovery, digital and
spatial imaging, and innovative morphological analysis of 3D cultures. Through continued emphasis on
advancing clinical and translational research and increasing collaborations among basic and clinical
investigators, TACMASR serves as a centralized resource, providing University of Arizona Cancer Center
(UACC) Members with access to clinically annotated, high-quality human specimens. TACMASR offers a
comprehensive biorepository coupled with advanced human and animal tissue analysis using state-of-the art

processing, banking, and distribution of human tissues; (2) support a full service research histology laboratory
that offers routine and specialized paraffin embedding, sectioning, automated hematoxylin and eosin staining,
frozen sectioning, and a large selection of special stains; and (3) develop new protocols and state-of-the-art
technologies to meet the special needs of requesting investigators and foster individualized approaches for the

10896020,"Project 1 Summary - Abstract
 Animal studies of acquired sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) have shown that loss of
synapses between auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) and inner hair cells (IHCs) often occurs before
permanent hair cell damage. This primary cochlear nerve degeneration (CND) has little effect
on thresholds, but decreases discriminability of sounds, especially in noisy environments, and
may trigger tinnitus and hyperacusis due to changes in excitation/inhibition in central auditory
circuits. In prior work, Project 1 showed that several suprathreshold electrophysiological metrics
can predict synaptic loss in animals when thresholds are normal, and Project 3 showed that
these metrics correlate with word-identification performance in challenging listening
environments among subjects with normal audiometric thresholds, consistent with a role for
CND in hearing impairment that hides behind the audiogram.
 Over the next 5 years, all Center Projects shift focus to the study of CND in cases where
thresholds are elevated. Consistent with the intent of the P50 mechanism, the primary role of
Project 1 animal work is in support of the human studies. To that end, we have developed a set
of animal models with complementary patterns of neural and hair cell damage. In Aim 1 we use
these models to: 1) clarify the cellular generators of the summating potential, the biomarker
best correlated with word scores in human subjects, 2) validate the utility of a novel
electrophysiologic metric, the envelope following response to rectangular-wave amplitude
modulation, in detecting CND in the presence of outer hair cell damage, and 3) determine
whether the different CND-eliciting lesions all selectively target cochlear neurons with high
thresholds and low spontaneous rates. For Aim 2, we have developed a novel
electrophysiological assay of central auditory hyperactivity (that will also be used in human
subjects) and a set of behavioral assays to detect changes in loudness perception and the
presence of phantom sounds. By applying these assays to animals with different lesion
patterns, we can test key hypotheses about the interactions between peripheral CND, central
gain control adjustments, and the disabling perceptual anomalies of tinnitus and hyperacusis."
10896021,"Project 2 Summary - Abstract
 Since the inner ear cannot be biopsied, and clinical imaging cannot produce cellular-level
resolution, the only way to uncover the functionally important structural changes underlying
sensorineural hearing loss is the microscopic examination of post-mortem human temporal
bones. This P50 Center focuses on primary neural degeneration in the inner ear (i.e. the loss of
synaptic connections between surviving sensory cells and auditory nerve cells), and its
hypothesized role in limiting the ability to understand complex stimuli like speech and as a key
elicitor of tinnitus and hyperacusis.
 Over the past 5 years, Project 2 showed, as predicted from animal models, that the rate of
auditory nerve loss in normal-aging human ears out-paced the rate of hair cell loss by 2:1, and
that this neural loss was further accelerated in those with a history of noise exposure. A rigorous
statistical model showed that while the audiometric thresholds were well predicted by the
patterns of hair cell loss, the neural loss did not affect threshold but contributed to the
differences in word identification abilities among those with similar audiograms.
 Over the next 5 years, Project 2 builds on this foundation to explore a wider range of
acquired hearing loss etiologies, i.e. ototoxic antibiotics and chemotherapeutics, sudden
sensorineural hearing loss and Ménière’s disease. We choose this because they are common,
well represented in our temporal bone archives, and are often associated with tinnitus and
difficulties in speech discrimination. We are developing machine-learning approaches to
automate the acquisition of quantitative histopathological data, because we aim to grow the
number of cases analyzed as rapidly as possible. As we have now entered the era of clinical
trials for deafness therapeutics, there is a critical need for robust statistical models to accurately
predict the degree and pattern of cellular loss from the audiogram, word score, hearing loss
etiology, age and sex of a candidate patient."
10903824,"Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks the third in cancer-related mortality because of ineffective therapy.
Intratumoral accumulation of regulatory T-cells (Tregs), which suppresses antitumor immunity, has been identified
in HCC. Despite the extensive research of microRNAs in HCC, their roles in regulating immunosuppression are
poorly described. Aberrant activation of AKT (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1) and Nras
(neuroblastoma ras viral oncogene homolog) (Ras) was observed in Kupffer cells (KCs) and hepatocytes (HCs)
in 74% of HCC patients. Hydrodynamic injection (HDI) of activated forms of AKT and Nras (AKT/Ras) into mice
triggered the development of lethal HCC within 6-8 weeks. MiRNA profiling revealed that miR-15a and miR-16-
1 cluster (miR-15a/16) was reduced in KCs from HCC tumors of AKT/Ras mice and patients. KC-specific
expression of miR-15a/16 fully prevented growth of aggressive HCC in AKT/Ras mice, while 100% of AKT/Ras
mice died from lethal tumor burden within 6-8 weeks post-injection. KC-specific expression of miR-15a/16 also
led to a significant regression of HCC tumors in AKT/Ras mice bearing tumors. Mechanistically, AKT/Ras
reprogrammed the transcriptome of KCs toward M2 polarization of KCs and drove a significant increase in serum
C-C motif chemokine 22 (CCL22) and mRNA levels of Ccl22 in KCs of AKT/Ras mice. In contrast, miR-15a/16
reversed this process and inhibited CCL22 overproduction by directly targeting NF-κB that activates transcription
of Ccl22. CCL22 recruits Tregs via CCR4 (C-C chemokine receptor type 4). Indeed, additional treatment of CCL22
recovered immunosuppression and growth of HCC that was fully prevented by miR-15a/16 in AKT/Ras mice.
We hypothesize that AKT/Ras-educated KCs initiate hepatic recruitment of Tregs by overproducing CCL22,
thereby promoting HCC development; while KC-specific expression of miR-15a/16 suppresses hepatic recruitment
of Tregs and HCC development by attenuating CCL22 production. The objective of this project is to elucidate the
role of AKT/Ras-educated KCs in promoting immune suppression that promotes growth of HCC, while miR-15a/16
reverses this process by inhibiting NF-κB signaling in KCs. The long-time goal is to develop KCs as a therapeutic
target and miR-15a/16 as a novel immunotherapy against HCC. Three specific aims are designed to test our
hypothesis. Specifically, we will (1) unravel the mechanism(s) by which AKT/Ras-educated KCs promote
immunosuppression and HCC development. (2) establish the mechanism(s) by which miR-15a/16 drives
antitumor immunity; and (3) evaluate the therapeutic potential of miR-15a/16 against HCC with divergent
backgrounds. The combination of strong preliminary data and a logical and rationally based experimental design
make this project highly feasible. We expect that this study will provide a novel insight into the immunosuppression
mechanisms in HCC and facilitate the design of KCs as a novel therapeutic target and miR-15a/16 as a rational
immunotherapy against HCC."
10904018,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Conventional
colonoscopy with white light illumination frequently misses pre-malignant lesions that are either flat or subtle in
appearance. CRC arises from either the traditional or serrated pathways in >95% of all known cases.
Development of imaging biomarkers expressed in these two pathways can improve methods for early CRC
detection. Successful completion of the aims will result in proof-of-concept for a targeted imaging strategy to
improve the effectiveness of colonoscopy for early CRC detection.
 Peptide monomers specific for cMet and peroxiredoxin-1 will be optimized and arranged in a heterodimer
configuration. These molecular targets are over expressed by pre-malignant lesions that arise from the
traditional and serrated pathways, respectively. IRDye800 will be used as a near-infrared fluorescence label.
Specific binding will be validated with cells in vitro and human colon specimens ex vivo using known
antibodies.
 A flexible fiber endoscope accessory will be developed to image the heterodimer in vivo. The scalable
optical design scans a low numerical aperture beam at large angles to achieve diffraction-limited resolution
over a wide field-of-view. A miniature scanner will be developed based on parametric resonance with mixed
stiffness-softening dynamics to deflect the beam at large angles. The compact form factor allows the
instrument to be passed forward through the biopsy channel of standard medical endoscopes.
 Patient-derived organoids will be used to validate specific binding by the peptide heterodimer and verify
the flexible fiber endoscope in vivo. These colonoids will be developed from traditional adenomas, sessile
serrated adenomas, and normal mucosa, and will be implanted orthotopically in immunocompromised mice.
These pre-malignant lesions appear endoscopically with flat and subtle features. Target expression levels and
genetic heterogeneity are representative of pre-malignant lesions seen in the clinic.
 This collaborative work will be led by PI TD Wang, an expert in development and validation of peptide-
based imaging agents. KR Oldham is an authority in microsystems-based scanning technologies, and JR
Spence is an expert in development of primary human organoid cultures."

Influenza A virus (IAV) is commonly complicated by secondary infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn)
and this increases the morbidity and mortality of IAV, particularly during IAV pandemics. Highly pathogenic avian
influenza (HPAI) currently poses a risk as the etiological agent for an influenza pandemic. However, little is known
about how this pathogen may increase susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. The airway epithelium
serves as the first line of defense against bacterial pathogens in the lungs and it is severely damaged during IAV
infection. Despite this, the role of the airway epithelium in increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial
infections after IAV is not well defined. IAV induces a robust endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response in the
airway, contributing to a disruption in host protein production during IAV infection. Interestingly, induced ER stress
in the airway epithelium leads to a reduction in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
function. Prior work from our lab demonstrates that IAV causes CFTR dysfunction, disrupting the airway surface
liquid and subsequently increasing the burden of Spn in primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells
(HBECs). Our preliminary data indicates that correction of ER stress during IAV infection reduces the burden of
Spn in the airway epithelium without interfering with IAV replication. The broad objective of this proposal is to
determine how ER stress during IAV infection is involved in both a loss of CFTR and an increase in susceptibility
to secondary Spn infections. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that ER stress during IAV disrupts host protein
production, damaging the airway epithelium by causing a loss of CFTR and a reduction in secreted host proteins.
To specifically study IAV infection in the airway epithelium, we will use an HBEC culture system. To identify the
role of ER stress in a loss of CFTR after IAV, we will infect cells with IAV and treat them with pharmacological
agents to manipulate the ER stress response and then quantify CFTR abundance and function by Western blot,
Ussing chamber analysis and micro-optical coherence tomography. Additionally, we will evaluate the effect of
ER stress during IAV on the secretion of host proteins by proteomic analysis of the airway surface liquid. Aim 2
will test the hypothesis that ER stress during IAV increases susceptibility to Spn and disrupts the host response
to bacterial infection. To evaluate the role of ER stress in increased susceptibility to Spn, we will coinfect HBECs
with IAV and Spn and treat them with pharmacological agents to manipulate the ER stress response. We will
quantify Spn in both the airway surface liquid and the airway epithelium. To determine the effect of IAV infection
on the ER stress response to Spn, we will coinfect HBECs with IAV and Spn and measure ER stress markers
by Western blot. We will evaluate various strains of Spn to identify strain-dependent effects on the induction of
ER stress. Additionally, will use both H1N1 and HPAI strains of IAV throughout this proposal to identify strain-
dependent differences that may contribute to the increased pathogenicity of HPAI."
10874749,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
We recently published a study that used genetic encoded voltage indicators to show that gamma-frequency
(specifically ~40 Hz) synchronization between parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the left and right mPFC
normally increases during specific cognitive tasks. Furthermore, specifically disrupting this synchrony was
sufficient to produce cognitive deficits similar to those observed in schizophrenia. Finally, we have found that
transiently increasing or decreasing gamma synchrony using optogenetic manipulations leads to long-lasting
changes in both gamma synchrony and cognition. Thus, gamma synchrony is a key mediator of cognition that
can undergo bi-directional plasticity thereby correcting or inducing cognitive deficits. This project will now use
genetically encoded voltage indicators, optogenetics, chemogenetics, slice electrophysiology and calcium
imaging, to identify interventions and cellular/synaptic mechanisms that produce therapeutic increases and
deleterious decreases in gamma synchrony, and elucidate exactly how changes in gamma synchrony affect
information processing by prefrontal circuits. This will lead to a greater understanding of how gamma
synchrony contributes to normal cognition, and reveal specific targets for restoring cognition in conditions such
as schizophrenia."

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in swift and catastrophic losses of human lives
globally. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the most detrimental outcomes of COVID-19
infection that can lead to the rapid deterioration and death of patients. ARDS is primarily caused by the cytokine
storm which unleashes a plethora of inflammatory cytokines during the late stages of COVID-19. The master
cytokines that are thought to be responsible for much of the damage are interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6)
and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Currently two clinical trials have shown the efficacy of IL-1 inhibitor in COVID-
19 patients. However, in many cases, the mechanism and impact of these cytokines during SARS-CoV-2
infection are poorly understood. An in-depth mechanistic understanding of cytokine induction is important
because this understanding will significantly impact the design and success of ARDS treatment. This application
focuses on the role and mitigation of the inflammasome complex which leads to the proinflammatory cytokine,
IL-1β, in ARDS. The inflammasome is a protein supramolecular structure that leads to caspase 1 activation,
which then cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to mature IL-1β and IL-18. In addition to the release of IL-1β and IL-
18, caspase 1 cleaves gasdermin D to cause inflammatory pyroptotic cell death, thus leading to a cascade of
cell death and inflammation. The inflammasome is comprised of a receptor or sensor, with the most prominent
ones represented by NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRP6, NLRC4 and AIM2. It also includes an adaptor molecule ASC
(apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), and the effector caspase-1. Each receptor or
sensor can be activated by specific pathogen products called PAMPs or cell damage associated molecules
called DAMPs. Single cell RNAseq data from COVID-19 patients show dramatic increases of inflammasome
sensors in the bronchial alveolar lavage of severe COVID-19 patients. In addition, we find a bidirectional feed-
forward loop of inflammasome activation and inflammatory cytokine induction involving myeloid cells and airway
stromal cells. This proposal will test the hypothesis that this two way amplification loop is important in COVID-
19."
10874752,"Cognitive decline that exceeds age-related decreases in cognition is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
and related dementias (ADRD). The cognitive decline observed in ADRD reflects underlying changes in brain
morphology. Recently, AD researchers have identified a cortical disease signature of AD that correlates with
symptom severity in AD patients and prospectively predicts the development of AD in cognitively normal adults.
Hence, poor cognitive function and abnormal brain morphology may serve as indicators of future ADRD risk.
Stressful life events such as spousal bereavement significantly increase rates of cognitive decline and ADRD in
widow(er)s. However, there is limited understanding of how spousal bereavement increases ADRD risk
and which widow(er)s are at greatest risk. Stress-related mechanisms likely contribute to poor cognitive
outcomes and elevated ADRD risk in widow(er)s. For example, depressive symptoms and systemic inflammation
– conditions that often follow prolonged exposures to stress – are also associated with poor cognitive function
and neurodegeneration in AD-related regions. Despite studies demonstrating that widow(er)s exhibit higher
levels of depressive symptoms and maladaptive patterns of immune function than nonbereaved adults, no work
has simultaneously examined how stress-related changes in physical and mental health relate to cognitive
function and neuroimaging biomarkers of AD among widow(er)s. Toward this end, the current study explores
the relationships between depressive symptoms, systemic inflammation, cognitive function, and the
cortical disease signature of AD in widow(er)s. Specific aims: (1) To characterize the relationship between
depressive symptoms, the AD cortical signature, and cognitive function (2) To characterize the relationship
between depressive symptoms, inflammation, and the AD cortical signature (Exploratory) To examine
relationships between depressive symptoms, blood-based phosphorylated tau, and the AD cortical signature.
Hypotheses: (H1a) Depressive symptoms will be negatively associated with cognitive function. (H1b) Thinner
cortex in AD regions will strengthen the negative relationship between depressive symptoms and cognitive
function. (H2) Higher levels of inflammation will strengthen the negative relationship between depressive
symptoms and cortical thickness in AD regions. Study design: Within a funded R21 parent grant, 80 widow(er)s
will undergo a structural MRI scan, receive a venous blood draw, perform cognitive assessments, and self-report
depressive symptoms at 6 months post-spousal death. Blood assays will be used to assess markers of systemic
inflammation (i.e., IL-6, TNF-a, IL-1b) and tau. The AD cortical signature will be obtained by applying atlas-based
parcellation methods to isolate cortical thickness in a priori AD regions of interest. This study will enhance
knowledge of biopsychosocial mechanisms related to cognitive impairment and neurobiological risk for AD,
improve early identification of at-risk individuals, and inform the development of tailored interventions that may
delay or reduce ADRD onset."

10874551,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT 
Moderate or severe TBI is a substantial health problem that in addition to often-devastating acute effects, can trigger chronic and evolving neuropathologies that may underlie long-term functional decline. Surprisingly protracted axonal degeneration and associated tissue atrophy has be observed following moderate-severe TBI in humans, persisting many months and years after injury and may contribute to progressive cognitive decline in some patients. However, the mechanisms that drive axons to continue to swell and degenerate in the months and years post-TBI are unknown, and potentially modifiable. Moreover, how the acute injury, including the degree of focal versus diffuse brain injury, contributes to the nature and progression of axon degeneration is unexplored.
Here we hypothesize that chronic axon degeneration in moderate-severe TBI reflects a progressive disconnection syndrome across neural networks via degeneration in both an anterograde and retrograde direction, which is dependent upon the nature and distribution of the initial injury. The death of neuronal somata, for example due to a focal lesion, can induce downstream (anterograde) degeneration of their efferent axons (and potentially their synaptic partners) and has long been thought as the dominant driver of axon loss in the subacute phase. In contrast, loss of a neuron's post-synaptic partner has been shown to drive retrograde degeneration via the loss of survival signaling (via the Jun Kinase/ c-Jun pathway). In preliminary data we provide evidence that both retrograde and anterograde degeneration drive chronic and progressive axon degeneration for many months and years post-TBI using multiple models and post-mortem human TBI tissue. Based on these compelling findings we propose an integrated translational design to 1) Determine the relative contribution and mechanisms of anterograde and retrograde degeneration chronically post-TBI in mice via examination of the neuronal network through tissue clearing techniques in combination with viral tracing and single cell RNA sequencing; 2) Utilize a gyrencephalic model of TBI to validate observations in mice and evaluate how progressive axon degeneration across the gyrencephalic brain determines behavioral outcome and, 3) Determine the role of focal and diffuse brain injuries in determining the extent, distribution and nature of progressive axon degeneration following human TBI using post-mortem samples.
Understanding the mechanisms by which axons degenerate in the chronic phase post-injury will provide important data necessary for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions over time following TBI."

Ozone is a ubiquitous air pollutant and the main component of photochemical smog. It remains a federally
regulated air pollutant of ongoing public health concern. Inhaled ozone irritates and damages the lung in both
healthy and susceptible individuals, including children and the elderly. Ozone causes inflammation and
constriction of the airways, reducing pulmonary function. Ozone also exacerbates asthma and chronic lung
disease. Thus, elucidating mechanisms of toxicity is highly relevant in terms of identifying new strategies to
reduce lung injury from ozone and potentially other air pollutants. Our studies are focused on macrophages,
which we have demonstrated play a key role in both initiating and resolving inflammatory responses to ozone-
induced tissue injury. These activities are mediated by distinct subsets broadly classified as proinflammatory
M1 and proresolution M2 macrophages. Effective resolution of inflammation following tissue injury depends on
metabolic reprogramming of macrophages from an M1 phenotype to an M2 phenotype, which involves a switch
from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation as a source of energy. We discovered that this reprogramming is
suppressed following ozone exposure. The goal of our studies is to analyze mechanisms underlying
suppression of macrophage reprogramming. In recent studies we identified farnesoid-X receptor (FXR), a
nuclear receptor important in regulating lipid metabolism, with anti-inflammatory activity, as central to
promoting M1 to M2 macrophage reprogramming in the lung. Following ozone exposure, macrophage FXR
activity is downregulated. This is associated with increased activity of proinflammatory M1 macrophages and
reduced activity of proresolving M2 macrophages. We also found that microRNAs that regulate the
proinflammatory transcription factor NFκB are dysregulated in macrophages after ozone exposure. As a
consequence, there is protracted activation of NFκB signaling resulting in increased production of inflammatory
mediators. We hypothesize that these mediators suppress FXR activity which prevents activation of the PPARγ
coactivator (PGC-1β), an inducer of macrophage M1 to M2 metabolic reprogramming. To test this hypothesis,
we will perform parallel studies in mice and humans and (1) Determine if persistent inflammation following
ozone exposure and lung injury is due to impaired development of proresolution M2 macrophages, and assess
whether this is caused by protracted activation of NFκB; (2) Analyze the role of FXR and its target, PGC-1β in
the development of proresolution M2 macrophages in the lung following ozone exposure; and (3) Assess
whether protracted activation of NFκB is a consequence of ozone-induced alterations in microRNAs regulating
NFκB. Results of these studies will provide new mechanistic insights into ozone toxicity. This will have
significant translational implications for the development of new strategies for preventing and treating the
toxicity of ozone, and possibly other agents that induce inflammatory lung injury."

Background: Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period affects up to 15% of US
mothers, imposing costs on mother, child, and society. Significantly more Black individuals meet
the criteria for depression than white individuals in the US, yet they are less likely to receive
mental health care, highlighting disparities in diagnosis and treatment. A United States
Preventive Services Task Force recommendation suggests that pregnant people at risk for
depression be proactively engaged in behavioral health services. For any depression prevention
approach to be scalable and sustainable, those at risk of depression must be accurately identified
prior to depression onset and subsequently connected to an evidence-based treatment that is
feasible, acceptable, and usable.
Methods Aim 1 will apply the PC Kernel Conditional Independence algorithm to two large
prospective observational datasets. The output will be models of the potential causal pathways of
perinatal depression onset that can be used to predict individual patient depression risk based on
factors that can 1) be queried from the existing electronic health record (EHR), and 2) can be
combined with EHR data to more precisely predict subsequent maternal depression above and
beyond standard of care screeners. This will create a minimal set of data needed for risk prediction
and intervention. Aim 2 will convene an expert panel of 5 OB/GYN providers and two community
engagement studios, one with Black pregnant individuals and one with white pregnant
individuals, to obtain feedback on the implementation needs and acceptability of the risk
prediction algorithms. Aim 3 will randomize 60 participants (50% Black individuals) who are at-
risk for future depression in the first trimester of pregnancy to a digital CBT (treatment) or usual
care (control), using a non-traditional, highly scalable approach to trial enrollment.
Potential Impact: This work will identify the data and processes necessary for a subsequent
randomized controlled trial of an acceptable, scalable, and largely digital strategy for depression
detection and prevention among pregnant people. It is highly innovative as it will be the first study
of its kind to identify risk prior to depression onset using a scalable approach to engaging a
diverse population of pregnant patients paired with digital mental health care provision,
incorporating the perspectives and experiences of the patient population for whom the model is
serving into the development process."

ABSTRACT
 Epidemiologic reports indicate that mood-related illnesses, like major depressive disorder (MDD), are
among the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the juvenile population. To make matters worse, women
are twice as likely to be diagnosed with MDD, a sex difference that becomes apparent during the adolescent
stage of development. These disparities highlight the critical need for the development of novel preclinical
models to uncover the neurobiological factors that underlie MDD as a function of age and sex – particularly,
because most animal models mainly incorporate adult male rodents. To address this issue, our group
developed the vicarious defeat stress (VDS) paradigm wherein a mouse witnesses the defeat bout of a male
conspecific from the safety of an adjacent compartment, leading to a behavioral outcome that resembles some
of the core symptoms of MDD (deficits in sociability, decreased preference for reward-related stimuli and body
weight, along with increased helplessness behavior and corticosterone). A major strength of this innovative
approach is that it allows for the experimental inclusion of females and juveniles – vulnerable populations that
are commonly excluded in preclinical/clinical studies. As such, the experiments described in this proposal will
evaluate whether exposing juvenile female and male mice to VDS results in behavioral outcomes that
recapitulate a depression-related phenotype. This will be accomplished within the framework of the following
specific aims: [1] assess the behavioral consequences of VDS on sensitivity to reward (cocaine, sucrose),
affect, and memory-performance in adolescent female and male mice (postnatal day 35). Also, [2] to evaluate
if traditional (fluoxetine) and novel (ketamine) antidepressant medications can reverse the VDS-induced
behavioral deficits observed. Lastly, [3] to evaluate the integrity of mood-related biological markers [brain
derived neurotropic factor (BDNF)-related signaling] within the hippocampus. It is expected that juvenile VDS
will mediate behavioral alterations associated with enhanced drug abuse potential (i.e., cocaine), anhedonia
(decreased sucrose preference), maladaptive responses to subsequent inescapable stress (despair), and
memory-related impairment. Furthermore, that clinically relevant medications (fluoxetine and ketamine) will
reverse the VDS-induced social dysfunction, mimicking what is observed at the clinic in juvenile populations.
Additionally, it is expected that site-specific neurochemical adaptations (BDNF fluctuations within the
hippocampus) will be observed after VDS exposure in an age and sex specific manner. Collectively, the
outcome of these studies will provide behavioral, pharmacological, and molecular evidence of VDS-induced
dysfunction that may underlie the convergent (both sexes experiencing MDD) and divergent (age- and sex-
specific) neurobiological underpinnings of MDD.

Sex differences impact the prevalence and degree of frailty. Women have a higher prevalence of more severe
frailty compared to age-matched men. A key difference between the sexes is their exposure to distinct steroid
hormone profiles across the life course. In studying how E2 (17β-estradiol) regulates metabolism across
female reproductive stages we recently identified a small population of ERα (estrogen receptor alpha) neurons
in the hypothalamus that drive spontaneous physical activity in mice in response to E2. These neurons
coordinate energy expenditure to support changes in behavior and physiology across the female reproductive
cycle. We predict that disengagement of these neurons after menopause contributes to metabolic and
functional declines that predispose women to frailty. However, using CRISPRa (CRISPR-mediated gene
activation) we can bypass ERα-dependent regulation of these neurons and dramatically increase physical
activity levels in female and male mice. As sedentary behavior is a risk factor for chronic diseases, including
frailty, and interventions that promote a more active lifestyle improve health and longevity, the goal of this R21
is to determine if we can leverage CRISPRa gene engineering in these nominally estrogen-sensitive neurons
to restore and maintain physical activity levels and associated health benefits as females age. In aim 1 we will
determine if stimulation of these activity-promoting neurons in E2-depleted mice is sufficient to ameliorate sex
differences in frailty phenotype and hypothalamic neuroinflammation. Longitudinal assessments of frailty
phenotype along with terminal examination of histological markers of neuroinflammatory stress in these
hypothalamic neurons will be performed in CRISPRa stimulated female and male mice as well as sedentary
controls. In response to exercise the liver produces several secreted factors that act systemically to improve
neuronal and metabolic health. The liver also expresses ERα and exhibits distinct gene expression programs
in males and females. In aim 2 we will determine if there are sex differences in the hepatic response to
physical activity that ultimately contribute to female bias in frailty. To that end we will use proximity labeling and
mass spectrometry to specifically examine physical activity-dependent changes in the liver secretome of
female and male mice. Collectively, we anticipate that this integrative approach will rationalize sex differences
in frailty and may identify new translational opportunities."
10872827,"Brain imaging has long been criticized for revealing correlations rather than causes. In recent years, there has been a rapid growth of focal brain stimulation technology, which can bring us closer to studying causes. If stimulating a speciﬁc brain circuit causes a speciﬁc behavioral change, then that circuit can be inferred to have a causal role in that behavior.  However, the number of potential stimulation sites is practically inﬁnite. This makes it diﬃcult to test the causal relevance of every possible stimulation target and every possible behavior. There is a need for a systematic wiring diagram that narrows the ﬁeld of potential options, enabling researchers and clinicians to make informed decisions about stimulation targets.  In this proposal, we will develop this wiring diagram. Using highly-sampled resting-state functional MRI scans as well as cutting-edge brain stimulation protocols, we will randomly apply stimulation to diﬀerent targets in each participant. To address the problem of a near-inﬁnite target space, we will narrow it down by mapping whole-brain connectivity of each target, not just its location. As a result, we will have information about every brain region for every participant, enabling us to draw whole-brain-level contrasts.  Using this information, we will map the circuitry connected to TMS sites that modulate a wide range of diﬀerent behaviors relevant to mental illness, including transdiagnostic behaviors and diagnosis-speciﬁc symptoms. We will include patients with major depression, obsessive- compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and generalized anxiety disorder. If successful, the study will yield a multidimensional atlas of causal brain circuitry, which can be used by future researchers and clinicians to select a stimulation target that is appropriate for the a speciﬁc patient based on their symptoms and objective emotional testing."

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability in the developed world, affecting over 30 million adults in the
US with an economic burden of over $486 billion per year. Advanced OA is most commonly treated with total
joint replacement, but this is suboptimal for younger patients, especially those under 55 who lead an active
lifestyle, because of the high occurrence of multiple revision surgeries. For this growing patient population,
Cytex is developing implants pairing a patented 3D weaving technology with additive manufacturing to facilitate
cartilage and bone regeneration in the joint. The implant is designed to support joint loading immediately at the
time of implantation and to allow integration and development of osteochondral tissue. Both an acellular
implant and a tissue engineered implant that combines the acellular scaffold with autologous cells have
demonstrated in large animal models of OA the capability of repairing osteochondral lesions and restoring
pain-free joint function for extended durations. The tissue engineered implant is particularly desirable for
patients without a potent endogenous cell source to repopulate the acellular implant and synthesize a mature
extracellular matrix in vivo. Cytex has chosen femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) in the hip as a lead
indication for a pilot clinical study with the acellular implant. FAI presents in active, young patients, with no
good option to repair the resulting osteochondral lesions, which progress into more severe OA. The tissue
engineered implant will follow the acellular product into clinical study. Autologous cells, as used in our pre-
clinical studies, require time-consuming cell isolation and expansion steps. Instead, Cytex will use allogeneic
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from bone marrow, which express very low levels of major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II antigens. To prepare the allogeneic tissue engineered
implants for clinical study, Cytex must further develop the tissue engineered implant to overcome specific
commercialization hurdles. The goal of this proposal is to address these hurdles: 1) Cytex must identify and
develop potency assays that measure the biological activity of the seeded cells and set acceptance criteria for
those assays. 2) Cytex will identify cryopreservation and storage conditions for the implants to be available off-
the-shelf because surgeons and patients are unlikely to wait several weeks for an implant to be made-to-order.
3) manufacturing of the tissue engineered implants will be transferred to a contract manufacturer that follows
the current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) required for regulatory approval. 4) Cytex, with an
experienced regulatory consulting firm, will engage with the US FDA to discuss requirements for clinical study
approval. The culmination of this project will be an off-the-shelf tissue engineered implant for cartilage repair
that will enable Cytex to broaden its implant portfolio and enable treatment for patients that currently have no
good clinical options either because of their advanced age or disease state."
10898916,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Researchers at state and local health departments producing small area estimates often face a lose-lose situation.
On one hand, there is a wealth of evidence of racial disparities in many health outcomes and their risk factors,
but stratifying data by space and race (in addition to factors such as age and sex) only exacerbates the issues
associated with small area estimation by dividing a dataset with small sample sizes into a larger dataset with
smaller sample sizes. On the other hand, while the use of complex statistical models can be used to produce
more precise estimates from limited data, estimates produced by state and local health departments may be
treated as “ofﬁcial statistics” and thus these agencies may be reluctant to rely too heavily on statistical models for
fear of the bias they may introduce.
 The objective of the proposed work is three-fold. Our ﬁrst task will be to develop statistical models for the
analysis of multivariate spatial data that allow users to pre-specify an upper bound on the model's informativeness
— i.e., a measure of the weight given to the model as compared to the data when producing model-based
estimates. This work will build on the rich spatial statistics literature and recent research that provides insight into
how to quantify the informativeness of spatial models. We will extend this approach to the setting of multivariate
spatial data for the purposes of calculating demographic group-speciﬁc estimates and age-adjusted estimates.
 Because we envision these methods being useful for researchers at state and local health departments, we
believe a thorough case study of our methods should be conducted to assess their suitability. To this end, our
second task will be to partner with the Philadelphia Department of Public Health and use the methods we've
developed to conduct a rigorous analysis of heart disease mortality and its risk factors in Philadelphia. This
analysis will produce yearly census tract-level estimates for rates of death due to several forms of heart disease
and estimates of the prevalence of key risk factors by age, gender, and race/ethnicity. The product of this research
will include a collection of reports — one focused on city-level trends and one focused on neighborhood-level
trends — an interactive online dashboard, and peer-reviewed publications that add context to our ﬁndings.
 Finally, we recognize that few state and local health departments have staff who are trained in advanced
spatial Bayesian statistical methods, a fact that could serve as an impediment to the use of the methods we
develop. To remedy this, our third task will be to partner with the CDC-funded GIS Capacity Building Project, which
provides training in geospatial analyses to state and local health departments. This month-long training program
begins by introducing users to the ArcGIS software package and concludes with an overview of a tool created by
the GIS Capacity Building Project — the Rate Stabilizing Tool (RST). For this project, we will partner with the GIS
Capacity Building Project to incorporate the methods we develop into the RST in a “black-box” framework and
provide additional training on the use of spatial Bayesian methods in disease surveillance."

Cachexia is characterized by progressive skeletal muscle and body weight loss and affects up to 80% of cancer
patients. Since this loss of muscle mass contributes to weakness, reduced tolerance to conventional treatments,
and increased mortality, understanding the mechanisms that drive muscle wasting is critical to the development
of treatments to improve quality of life and enhance survival of cancer patients. However, in exploring the
mechanisms that may drive cancer-induced atrophy of myofibers, it is important to do so in the context of the
broader muscle pathologies that we and others have shown in the muscle of cachectic tumor bearing hosts,
including tissue damage, non-resolute inflammation, impaired regeneration, and increased fat, collagen and
calcium deposition. Unpublished proteomics data from our lab collected in the skeletal muscle of cachectic
pancreatic cancer patients and, subsequently, cachectic mice bearing pancreatic tumors, releaved an
enrichment of multiple pathways of the complement (Cp) system. Further immunohistochemical analyses
revealed increased deposition of the central component of the Cp system, C3, and the terminal
pathway/membrane attack complex (MAC) within muscle tissues of people and mice with pancreatic tumors,
compared to controls. Based on these findings and the established roles of Cp proteins in causing inflammation
and tissue damage, we injected mouse pancreatic cancer (KPC) cells into the pancreas of C3 knockout (C3-/-)
mice and found significant protection against KPC-induced muscle wasting and weakness, that was further linked
to reduced leukocyte infiltration into muscle and reduced fibrotic remodeling. These overall findings establish the
requirement of Cp activation for the development of cachexia, with strong translational relevance. Aim 1 will
build on these foundational findings and identify the specific Cp activation pathway and effector mechanism(s)
required for the development of tumor-induced muscle pathologies and cachexia. This will reveal optimum points
in the Cp pathway for pharmacological blockade. Aim 2 will utilize mouse Cp inhibitors that function at different
points in the Cp pathway, targeted to sites of Cp deposition, to identify the most effective therapeutic strategy to
prevent and reverse cachexia in tumor bearing mice using both the KPC model and C26 adenocarcinoma model.
Aim 3 will determine the sufficiency and requirement of local myofiber-derived C3 in pancreatic cancer-induced
immune cell infiltration into muscle, muscle damage, atrophy and weakness. This mechanistic aim is important
because the role of local myofiber-derived Cp in muscle health and disease is almost completely unknown.
Therefore, our findings here will provide mechanistic insights that will enable us to optimize and develop novel
Cp inhibitory strategies for the treatment of a broad range of muscle conditions."

10902905,"Project Summary: The long-term objective of this work is to define the molecular mechanisms
underlying proprioceptive signaling that are required for sensory-driven motor behaviors.
Proprioception encodes body and limb position, which is essential for purposeful movement. Yet, the
lack of tools to selectively target genes in proprioceptors, the sensory neurons that carry proprioceptive
signals, has impeded our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this vital ""sixth
sense."" Voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs) are critical for neuronal signaling in the nervous system,
and proprioceptors express three isoforms: NaV1.1, NaV1.6, and NaV1.7. We recently discovered that
loss of NaV1.1 in sensory neurons causes ataxic-like behaviors and abnormal limb positioning and
impaired proprioceptor transmission during static muscle stretch. While loss of NaV1.7 has no impact
on motor function in mice or humans, NaV1.6 is known to contribute to the function of brain neurons
involved in motor control. Thus, our lab created a sensory neuron-wide knock out of NaV1.6 and found
that these animals have extremely severe motor coordination deficits distinct from those observed in
NaV1.1 conditional knockout animals. This proposal will uncover the mechanistic role of NaV1.6 in
proprioceptive signaling by developing the first CRISPR/Cas9 intersectional genetic and viral strategy
to manipulate genes in selectively proprioceptors. The work outlined herein will test the central
hypothesis that the unique cellular localization patterns and intrinsic properties of NaV1.6 underly the
transmission of proprioceptive signals to spinal motor circuits for motor behaviors. I test this hypothesis
using the following mechanistic aims: Aim 1 will analyze the cellular distribution patterns of NaV1.6
channels in proprioceptive sensory neurons. Aim 2 will investigate how loss of NaV1.6 changes
proprioceptor biophysical properties and excitability. Aim 3 will leverage an intersectional gene knock
out model to investigate how acute deletion of NaV1.6 proprioceptors affects sensory-motor circuit
function and motor behaviors, overcoming a long-standing challenge in the field. NaV1.6 is associated
with brain-related diseases like epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder. Symptoms of these diseases
include motor-related deficits; however, our understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to these
comorbidities outside the brain is understudied. The proposed herein are directly in line with the goals
of NINDS as it will 1) advance our knowledge about mammalian proprioception and 2) shed new light
on critical roles of peripheral sensory neuron signaling in neurological disorders. Furthermore, this
proposal will not only provide critical me new training in molecular biology and biochemistry techniques,
but also offer the scientific community a new and exciting approach to gene manipulation in challenging-
to-target neuronal populations."
10902766,"ABSTRACT
Many diseases, including cancer and those resulting from viral infections, are associated with alterations in the
function of host translational machinery. These alterations are referred to as “ribosomal hijacking” and occur
through various mechanisms. I propose to explore a poorly characterized mechanism utilized by pathogenic
mRNAs. This mechanism involves the inhibition of canonical host proteins involved in translation and results in
the activation of a non-canonical translation pathway mediated by the alternate translation initiation factor
eIF2A, a distinct protein from the canonical eIF2 complex. Under stress conditions, phosphorylation of the
alpha-subunit of eIF2 results in general downregulation of cellular protein synthesis. Yet, mRNAs that contain
internal ribosome entry sites (IRES), such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein
kinase Src (c-Src), circumvent eIF2-mediated translation initiation through an eIF2A-mediated alternate
mechanism. The role of eIF2A in translation of these mRNAs underscores its significance as this mechanism
exhibits a significant connection to human health and disease. Exploring the biochemical and structural basis
for eIF2A binding and recruitment of tRNA to form an initiation complex with the ribosome will increase our
understanding of eIF2A function and the role it plays in the translation of pathogenic mRNA. To elucidate the
mechanism of eIF2A-mediated initiation I will determine high resolution structures of eIF2A loading tRNA onto
the ribosome in an initiation state via cryoEM. Furthermore, I will employ crystallography techniques to
determine high resolution structures of eIF2A-tRNA complexes to determine the basis for tRNA binding and
selectivity by eIF2A."

Long-Term Objectives: The overarching goal of the proposed project is to leverage electrophysiological (EEG)
recordings and computational modeling to identify variations in the episodic memory specificity among young
and older adults. This will help clarify the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying age-related declines in
memory specificity. The applicant’s main career objective is to develop a program of research integrating
behavioral, neuroscientific, and computational modeling techniques to understand age-related memory changes.
Specific Aims: The proposed project aims to (1) identify EEG correlates of variations in episodic memory
specificity within and across non-cognitively impaired young and older adults, (2) leverage computational
modeling at the individual-subject level to identify cognitive processes accounting for these variations, and (3)
link computational model parameters with EEG correlates of memory specificity to deepen our understanding
of the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying age-related declines and individual variations in the represen-
tational quality of episodic memory. To complete the proposed project, the applicant will receive extensive
mentored training in scalp EEG analyses and computational modeling.
Method: We will collect scalp EEG recordings across multiple experimental sessions as non-cognitively im-
paired young and older adult participants completely mnemonic similarity recognition tasks. Using machine
learning classifiers, we will reduce the highly-dimensional neural data into single predictor variables that we
will relate to participants’ recognition performance to identify EEG correlates of variations in memory specificity
within and across individuals. We will fit a computational model of memory at the individual-subject level to
identify cognitive processes underlying variations in recognition performance and associated mnemonic rep-
resentations. Linking the EEG correlates with our computational model parameters will enable us to identify
neurocognitive processes of age-related declines and individual variations in episodic memory specificity.
Significance: The outcomes of this project will provide novel insights into neurocognitive mechanisms that
underlie age-related declines and individual variations in the quality of episodic memories. This can pave
the way for future applications seeking non-invasive methods to identify individuals at risk for progressing to
neurocognitive disease states and in targeting interventions to combat or prevent memory loss."
10903588,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cannabis is the most used illicit drug by adolescents, and cannabis vaping is on the rise. Cannabis use during
adolescence is concerning as adolescence is a time of considerable development of the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC)—a brain region that mediates higher-order cognitive functioning. Thus, the mPFC may be vulnerable to
long-lasting perturbations from cannabis if use occurs during this particular developmental window. Indeed,
human and preclinical studies have reported enduring impairments in mPFC-sensitive cognitive flexibility in
adulthood after adolescent cannabis use. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons regulate mPFC function and are
impacted by cannabinoids in adolescence. However, since PV interneurons do not express cannabinoid
receptors, these cannabinoid effects must be through an indirect mechanism. Perineuronal nets (PNNs)
surround PV interneurons to support their function and are reduced following adolescent cannabinoid treatment.
Microglia express cannabinoid receptors and have been reported to degrade and engulf PNNs. Importantly, we
have recently found that adolescent vaporized cannabis use leads to increased microglial activation in the mPFC
in addition to cognitive flexibility impairment in adulthood. Thus, we propose here to investigate microglia as a
mechanism of adolescent cannabis-induced mPFC dysfunction with two aims. The first aim will determine
whether microglia activation is necessary for cognitive flexibility deficits induced by adolescent vaporized
cannabis exposure. We will use a combination of our rat model of noncontingent vaporized cannabis exposure
and chemogenetic inactivation of microglia during adolescence to test the hypothesis that adolescent cannabis-
induced microglial activation underlies the mPFC-sensitive cognitive flexibility deficits seen in adulthood. The
second aim will determine whether microglia activation influences the effect of adolescent vaporized cannabis
exposure on PV interneuron function and their surrounding PNNs. We will chemogenetically inactive microglia
during vaporized cannabis exposure in adolescence and use immunohistochemistry and slice electrophysiology
in adulthood to test the hypothesis that cannabis-induced microglial activation reduces PNNs around PV
interneurons in the mPFC and lowers the intrinsic excitability of PV interneurons. We predict that inactivating
microglia during adolescent cannabis exposure will prevent the breakdown of PNNs, thereby preserving PV
interneuron function. The proposed studies will allow us to gain insight into the complex interplay between
neurons, glia, and the extracellular matrix in mediating mPFC dysfunction as a consequence of adolescent
vaporized cannabis exposure. Furthermore, findings from the studies in this proposal may identify potential
biological targets for developing strategies aimed at preventing the cognitive consequences of adolescent
vaporized cannabis use."
10904111,"There is an estimated 5.7 million Americans that are current cocaine users and, at present, there are no FDA-
approved treatments for cocaine use disorders. This research project is a continuation of funded work aimed at
understanding the behavioral, pharmacological and neurobiological variables influencing the reinforcing effects
of cocaine in a unique nonhuman primate model: intravenous cocaine self-administration (SA) in socially
housed cynomolgus monkeys. The goals of the present application are to continue using this homologous
animal model to examine the mechanisms of action mediating the interactions between social hierarchy and
environmental and pharmacological modulation of cocaine self-administration in female and male monkeys.
Using PET imaging, over the previous funding period, we have noted sex- and social-rank related differences
in dopamine (DA) D2/D3 receptor (D2/D3R) and kappa opioid receptor (KOR) availability in cocaine-naïve
monkeys through long-term cocaine SA. Consistent with these sex- and social-rank differences, we noted
individual differences in response to several pharmacological manipulations. In Aim 1, we propose to extend
the characterization of sex- and social-rank differences in cocaine SA to examine several behavioral
interventions. For these studies, monkeys will choose between cocaine and food and the following
interventions will be examined: delay discounting involving both food and cocaine delays; changes in the
magnitude of the food reinforcer, to better model contingency management; and punishment, using a KOR
agonist (positive punishment), which will be important since we have measures of KOR availability in these
monkeys, as well as using response-contingent timeouts (negative punishment). The studies in Aim 2 will
examine the effects of chronic drug treatments in socially housed monkeys self-administering cocaine in the
context of an alternative, non-drug, reinforcer (food-cocaine choice). We will also combine chronic
pharmacological treatments with behavioral interventions in an effort to further decrease cocaine choice.
Importantly, cognitive performance will be assessed to better determine if the intervention has unwanted side
effects. The goals of Aim 3 are to examine how cocaine SA and chronic drug treatment differentially affects
D2/D3R and KOR availability, using a within-subjects design, in socially housed female and male monkeys.
The scientific premise is that different mechanisms maintain cocaine SA based on social rank and sex and
thus different intervention strategies (both behavioral and pharmacological) will be required to produce a
positive outcome in these groups. We are proposing a preclinical personalized-medicine strategy for treating
cocaine abuse that incorporates sex and social variables."
10901131,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fibromyalgia (FM) is a common and debilitating chronic pain condition. Given the unknown pathophysiology
and the lack of biomarkers in FM, accurate and clinically meaningful assessment of symptoms is critical. Pain
and other FM symptoms are typically studied as if they were static with any intra-individual variability either not
captured by measurement approaches, averaged out, or treated as noise/error. Yet, when asked, most FM
patients will report substantial fluctuations in their symptoms over time. Across chronic pain conditions, higher
pain variability is associated with a host of negative outcomes, and has been identified as a promising predictor
of treatment response. Yet, methodological tools that could characterize this variability have not been leveraged
to their full potential. The proposed project will use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data (3X/daily
ratings of pain, mood, and stress for 8 days) from 72 FM patients collected as part of a NIAMS funded clinical
trial (R21AR082574) evaluating metformin as a treatment for FM alongside an added measure of short-term
variability in response to experimentally induced pain. Long-term variability in clinical pain has been highlighted
as a promising potential predictor of clinically relevant outcomes in chronic pain patients, but it has yet to be fully
evaluated in FM patients, and using short-term variability as a predictor is completely novel. While metrics of
pain variability likely have clinical utility on their own, decomposing factors (e.g., emotional state or endogenous
pain modulatory (EPM) functioning) that contribute to variable pain experiences could have even more utility.
The proposed research will apply and develop advanced models to characterize pain variability in fibromyalgia
patients. Aims 1 and 2 will determine the potential of both long-term variability of clinical pain (Aim 1) and short-
term variability in response to experimental pain (Aim 2) as potential behavioral phenotypes to predict clinically
relevant outcomes (symptom severity, functional ability, and treatment response). Aim 3 will craft a theoretically
informed model that will index the relative contributions of incoming pain signals, emotional state, and EPM
functioning for a given pain state in a given patient with the goal of outputting individualized pain profiles that can
be used in precision medicine contexts to target fibromyalgia treatments more effectively. This project is in line
with the ""precision medicine for arthritis, musculoskeletal, and skin diseases"" scientific theme in the 2020-2024
NIAMS strategic plan. This fellowship application describes detailed research and training plans that draw upon
the expertise of the Sponsor, Co-Sponsors, and Consultants to prepare the candidate to sucessfully launch a
career as an academic researcher at an R1 institution."
10901138,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Substance use disorders (SUDs) impair the health and well-being of over 40 million Americans and claim
106,000 lives each year due to a lack of effective treatments. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), which consists of
medium spiny neurons (MSNs) marked by expression of Dopamine-1 or -2 receptors (D1 or D2, respectively),
is a reward center of the brain that exhibits changes in synaptic plasticity that drive addiction. D1-MSNs drive
rewarding behaviors, such as addiction, while D2-MSNs drive aversive behaviors. Thus, identifying precise
molecular targets that modulate D1-MSN synaptic signaling would hold promising therapeutic potential for SUDs.
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is selectively expressed in D1-MSNs within the NAc. In the brain, ACE
hydrolyzes numerous neuropeptides, including the enkephalin Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe (MERF), which has a
high affinity for opioid receptors. ACE inhibition (ACEi) increases levels of MERF in the NAc, which acts in a -
opioid receptor (MOR) dependent manner at excitatory presynaptic inputs to drive long-term depression (ACEi-
LTD) specifically onto D1-MSNs. However, it has not yet been determined which specific excitatory and inhibitory
presynaptic inputs express ACEi-LTD, as NAc MSNs receive a diverse array of long-range excitatory and local
inhibitory inputs.
 The main goal of this proposal is to determine which specific excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic inputs
to NAc MSNs express ACEi-LTD, revealing the circuit-specific synaptic plasticity mechanisms evoked by ACEi
which is critical for developing circuit-informed therapies for SUDs. Towards this, excitatory opsins will be
expressed virally in an input and cell type-specific manner in individual inputs to the NAc. Whole-cell patch-clamp
electrophysiological recordings will be taken from D1- and D2-MSNs while optogenetically stimulating individual
excitatory or inhibitory inputs. Optically- and electrically-evoked postsynaptic currents will be measured before,
during, and after application of an ACE inhibitor to determine which specific excitatory and inhibitory inputs exhibit
ACEi-LTD. The MOR-dependence of ACEi-LTD will be determined using pharmacological and genetic blockade
of MOR signaling. Since thalamic inputs to the NAc are known to drive opiate dependence, and since prior
studies suggest that ACEi modulates cortical excitatory inputs to the NAc, Aim 1 will investigate the ACEi
sensitivity of thalamic and cortical excitatory inputs onto MSNs. Additionally, since fast-spiking interneurons
(FSIs) provide the most robust regulation of MSN output, and since low-threshold spiking interneurons (LTSIs)
are known to decrease presynaptic release upon MOR-agonist treatment, Aim 2 will investigate the ACEi
sensitivity of FSI and LTSI inhibitory inputs onto MSNs. This proposal will reveal the circuit-specific effects of
ACEi, which selectively targets D1-MSNs of the NAc that drive reward and contribute to addictive behaviors.
Since ACEi attenuates fentanyl preference in mice, ACE may be a precise and safe therapeutic target for the
prevention and/or treatment of SUDs such as opioid use disorder."
10901139,"ABSTRACT
Cell migration is critical for processes such as tissue development and repair. A key aspect of mesenchymal cell
migration is the formation and turnover of cellular adhesions, multilayered protein complexes that link the actin
cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. Adhesions must be turned over to enable cell migration, and defects in
adhesion disassembly underlie developmental defects in some tissues and cancer cell movement in metastasis.
Local intracellular calcium signaling by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) precedes adhesion disassembly, but the
signals that initiate calcium signaling, as well as the mechanisms for how the ER is spatiotemporally targeted to
focal adhesions destined to turn over, are not known. This proposal presents preliminary data revealing a novel
ER-to-actin tether, calmin/CLMN, that links the ER to the cytoskeleton to influence cellular adhesion dynamics
and cell migration. Mechanistically, CLMN has actin-binding domains and localizes to ER tubules; in addition,
CLMN localizes to a subpopulation of cellular adhesions. CLMN-depleted migrating cells exhibit a greater
number of cellular adhesions and migrate more slowly than controls. The driving hypothesis of this proposal
is that CLMN mediates tethering of the ER to actin and facilitates adhesion turnover by positioning the
ER near actin to spatially localize calcium influx, in turn enabling cell migration. The research proposed
in this fellowship will use molecular biology, biochemical, and advanced microscopy techniques to determine the
mechanisms for localization and actin targeting by CLMN. Furthermore, the proposed research will use live cell
imaging of CLMN, ER, adhesion markers, and intracellular calcium biosensors in migrating cells to determine a)
the sequence of events in recruiting ER to adhesions to facilitate migration and b) how this sequence is perturbed
in the absence of CLMN. This work will fill a critical knowledge gap of how the ER interacts with the actin
cytoskeleton and spatially coordinates ER-actin crosstalk for cell migration. Taken together, this research
will also further our understanding of the mechanisms of adhesion disassembly during cell migration and inform
changes that occur during normal and diseased tissue development. The proposed research and training plan
will also prepare the applicant for a productive scientific career as an independent investigator leading studies
of how organelle-cytoskeleton interactions influence cell physiology."
10901203,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This work proposes to refine novel non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods to quantify
cerebral oxygen extraction and to apply these methods in persons with sickle cell anemia (SCA) to
elucidate potential mechanisms for cerebral infarct development.
SCA, caused by homozygous inheritance of mutant hemoglobin S (HbS), is the most severe and yet common
form of sickle cell disease affecting approximately 1 in every 500 African Americans in the United States. The
disease is characterized by the sickling of erythrocytes following deoxygenation of mutant HbS, which manifests
in patients as chronic hemolytic anemia and possible vascular occlusion. More than half of individuals with SCA
will have a silent cerebral infarct (SCI) by age 30 years; while largely asymptomatic at the time of injury, these
SCIs can lead to progressive infarctions and cognitive deficits. Despite the high risk of infarction in these
patients, few patients exhibit traditional risk factors for stroke such as macrovascular steno-occlusion
and as such it has been difficult to develop biomarkers that can be used to triage patients for
conservative versus more aggressive disease-modifying or curative therapies. Cerebral infarctions in
persons with SCA are likely due to alternative vascular and metabolic changes at the tissue level secondary to
the disease. It is well-established that cerebral blood flow (CBF) is elevated in SCA to compensate for reduced
hemoglobin, but CBF is an incomplete predictor of ischemic risk by itself. Prior work in our lab has shown reduced
capillary transit times in the presence of elevated CBF in individuals with SCA may lead to inefficient cerebral
oxygen extraction at the capillary level. It is critical to accurately characterize these and possibly related changes
in tissue physiology to establish functional biomarkers that can be used to triage patients with SCA to risk-
appropriate treatments, or rather, to use these biomarkers as end-points in clinical trials.
To address these needs, non-invasive imaging methods such as the asymmetric spin echo (ASE) MRI sequence
have been developed to characterize cerebral oxygen extraction in humans. However, current methodological
variants underestimate cerebral oxygen extraction metrics due to technical shortcomings of isolating
extravascular water signal in the sequence. The goals of this proposal are (1) to refine and evaluate MRI
methods to accurately quantify regional cerebral oxygen extraction and (2) to understand relationships
between regional changes in oxygen extraction and blood transit times in adults with SCA before and
after blood transfusions that modulate hemoglobin and flow velocities. Successful completion should
provide new methods to monitor tissue health in SCA and to improve our understanding of how tissue subserves
oxygen in the setting of anemia and in response to treatments."
10901273,"Project Summary
Closed-loop VNS was recently approved by the FDA to restore upper limb mobility for patients with stroke.
Moreover, preclinical and early clinical studies suggest that closed-loop VNS improves recovery from conditions
such as spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder and addiction. Despite the wide-
ranging etiology of these conditions, the therapeutic model is similar; VNS is paired with a relevant rehabilitation
protocol. The precise timing of stimulation is a key element to drive specific circuit plasticity and functional
recovery. Yet, VNS activates widespread brain networks, raising the question of how closed-loop VNS can lead
to circuit-specific alterations in plasticity and functional recovery.
 The goal of this proposal is to identify the mechanism by which closed-loop VNS drives circuit-specific
plasticity during motor learning and stroke recovery. Our lab has shown, for the first time, that VNS elicits phasic
cholinergic signaling from the basal forebrain (BF) and modulates inhibitory interneurons in motor cortex.
Cholinergic signaling from BF is recognized to play a critical role in learning and plasticity and recovery from
injury. The influence of cholinergic signaling on cortical plasticity is mediated through inhibitory interneurons,
which gate synaptic plasticity within cortex.
 We hypothesize that closed-loop VNS drives recovery from stroke through cholinergic modulation of
inhibitory interneurons to produce circuit-specific plasticity. The objectives of this proposal will be 1) to determine
if closed-loop VNS drives synaptic plasticity on active circuits via cholinergic signaling; 2) to determine the
influence of cholinergic signaling on inhibitory interneuron gating of synaptic plasticity and; 3) to explore the role
of cholinergic activity and inhibitory interneuron gating of plasticity during stroke recovery. This data will provide
a detailed mechanism by which closed-loop VNS can drive plasticity in the healthy and injured nervous system."
10901275,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic cancer has a dismal average life expectancy of around six months, in large part due to the marked
immunosuppression surrounding the tumor preventing an anti-tumor immune response (1,2). A mediator of the
pancreatic cancer immunosuppression is regulatory T cells (Tregs) (3). Tregs are a known pro-tumorigenic
population within pancreatic cancer tumors but complete depletion of Tregs results in accelerated tumor
progression, indicating that there is a delicate balance of Tregs needed (4,5). The goal of this proposal is to
use in vitro assays to characterize the population of CCR6+ Tregs that show increased immunosuppressive
capabilities. Further, the effects of CCL20, the only chemokine ligand for CCR6, will be assessed on its ability
to shape Treg function. Next, the impact of CCR6-CCL20 signaling will be tested using in vivo models of
pancreatic cancer with the aim of striking the balance needed for targeting some, but not all, Tregs to achieve
an anti-tumor immune response. My preliminary data show that CCR6+ Tregs are enriched within pancreatic
cancer tumors and they possess superior suppressive abilities compared to CCR6- Tregs. CCL20 is
upregulated in pancreatic cancer and is associated with a worse prognosis and thus poses as an attractive
target to overcome local immunosuppression (6). The central hypothesis of this proposal is that CCL20
induces a “super suppressor” phenotype on CCR6+ Tregs and these super suppressor CCR6+ Tregs are
responsible for the CCL20-mediated pro-tumorigenic effects seen in PDAC. Our lab has been a leader in
defining the role of chemokines in cancer and is thus perfectly suited to pursue this question. Utilizing inducible
Tregs, bulk sequencing, and functional assays, I will extensively characterize the mechanisms in the
immunosuppressive arsenal of CCR6+ super suppressor Tregs. Additionally, I will use in vivo models of
pancreatic cancer to explore the impact of CCL20-CCR6 in pancreatic cancer progression and on the tumor
microenvironment through extensive analysis with flow cytometry and single nucleus RNA sequencing
(snRNA-seq). This would be the first study to perform snRNA-seq on in vivo models of pancreatic cancer, an
urgent need due to snRNA-seq’s ability to better capture the large fibroblast populations present within
pancreatic cancer compared to single cell RNA sequencing (7,8). Lastly, I will test the ability of a novel
compound, generated by our group, that inhibits CCR6 chemotaxis to function within pancreatic cancer tumors
(9). Collectively, these data will give greater insight into Treg function, increase understanding of how the
immunosuppressive pancreatic cancer microenvironment forms, evaluate the ability of a prominent preclinical
model of pancreas cancer to accurately recapitulate human disease, and investigate the efficacy of a novel
pharmacological compound."

(Danny Welch, PhD and Lisa Harlan-Williams, PhD) works closely with Community Outreach and
Engagement (COE) and educators from four KUCC campuses to increase education and outreach to diverse
populations and cultivates an environment of lifelong learning throughout our catchment area. KUCC faculty
actively participate in training high school through post-graduate researchers in multiple biomedical and
healthcare fields by coordinating and integrating cancer education at all KUCC campuses. KUCC faculty have
developed new doctoral and certificate programs, provided research experiences (including for
underrepresented populations (URP) in the Kansas City metropolitan area); provided medical and nursing
continuing education curricula; developed specialized senior-to-junior mentoring and facilitated peer-to-peer
career development; assisted with grant preparation for faculty and trainees, and supported trainee travel.
CRTEC is leading institutional development of an integrated system for tracking and assessment of trainee
outcomes. KUCC trainees have made discoveries in basic, translational, clinical, and population science,
received numerous honors and awards, publications, and experienced >3-fold increase in extramural

professional school to faculty, by providing an integrative approach to investigator development. The PD Core
promotes the professional development of investigators in the clinical and translational sciences (CTS) across
West Virginia (WV) through new opportunities created, organized, and delivered via robust institutional
partnerships and programs in the WVCTSI. The overarching goal is to enhance investigators’ ability to develop
and sustain competitive, independent research programs and increase collaborative research activities that
target health conditions in the medically underserved and rural communities of this state, while fostering inclusion
of individuals with diverse backgrounds and research interests. The PD Core has a strong record of effective
programmatic activities that include academic graduate CTS degree programs, professional development
workshops and seminars, early stage investigator research mentoring programs, grant proposal development
services, mentorship in clinical trials, and diverse working groups, with these programs to be continued in the
renewal (years 11-15). The PD core will develop new programs to continue meeting the overarching goals by
1) instituting a solid mentoring framework that promotes sustained success and diversification of CTS
researchers in WV, 2) setting the stage for early stage clinicians to jump-start a career in CTS research, and 3)
strengthening professional development and research distribution by reducing barriers to publication. The PD
Core will sustain the successes of the past decade and pivot to ensure the long-term sustainability of the WV
research capacity by implementing the following specific aims: 1) Establish the WVCTSI Mentorship Training
Program to support research career development across disciplines, career stages, and partner sites, 2)
Empower the training of early career stage clinicians in CTS by establishing the Fellows Research Academy
(FRA) program, and 3) Enhance the dissemination and impact of the WVCTSI members’ clinical and translational
research findings through editorial support and honing of specific writing skills. The target audiences for the PD
Core services include faculty and advanced trainees in the health professions (DDS, DO, MD, MD/PhD, PA,
PharmD, PhD and RN) and include active recruitment of non-traditional trainees (bioengineering, computer
sciences, clinical psychology, and business economics) in WV. By building upon past successes, implementing
the Aims outlined, and through its strong collaborative partnerships, the PD Core will address the specific needs
of clinical and translational investigators while also developing the workforce capacity needed to provide
discoveries and solutions through research to address the health disparities in WV and rural Appalachian areas.
The PD Core programs will provide a strong foundation to achieve the WVCTSI goal of improving the health of
West Virginians by growing the next generation of investigators conducting clinical and translational research."
10906328,"CANCER BIOLOGY: ABSTRACT
The Cancer Biology (CB) program represents basic science initiatives of The University of Kansas Cancer
Center (KUCC), unified by member utilization of molecular, biochemical, and model organism and cell-based
approaches to study the aberrant behavior of cancer cells. The CB scientific goal is to support KUCC’s
strategic plan by discerning the molecular mechanisms that define normal and neoplastic cell growth to identify
and characterize cells, molecules, pathways, and processes that are involved in tumor growth and progression,
which can serve as useful biomarkers or as new cellular targets for cancer prevention and therapeutics,
particularly in tumors important to the KUCC’s catchment area. To accomplish this, CB aims to catalyze
collaborations that promote basic discoveries that can be translated from bench-to-bedside.
CB has 46 full and 14 associate members representing four campuses: the University of Kansas Medical
Center (KUMC) (67%), University of Kansas – Lawrence (KU-L) (10%), Children’s Mercy (CM) (5%), and
Stowers Institute for Medical Research (Stowers) (18%). In 2020, CB garnered over $9M in cancer-related,
peer-reviewed funding of which $1.2M was from NCI and $6.9M was from other institutes at NIH. From 2016-
2020, members published 880 cancer-relevant, peer-reviewed papers. Of these publications, 13% were in
high-impact journals (JIF >10) and the average impact factor for all 880 publications is 6.1. Since renewing the
CCSG in 2017, CB program cohesion and integration have increased, with 21% of the publications during the
funding cycle resulting from inter-programmatic interactions (up from 20% in 2016) and 29% from intra-
programmatic interactions (up from 21% in 2016). CB members are well-integrated into the national and
international scientific community as evident by over half of the publications (51%) including authors from other
institutions and 23% including authors from other NCI-designated cancer centers.
CB is jointly led by Kristi Neufeld (KU-L), Linheng Li (Stowers), Sufi Thomas (KUMC), and Tomoo Iwakuma
(CM), who bring complementary scientific expertise in cell biology, stem cell biology, biochemistry, translational
research, leadership experience, and diverse institutional representation. Shrikant Anant is Associate Director
for Basic Science. CB leadership employs a variety of mechanisms to foster intra- and inter-programmatic
collaborations, including research retreats, seminars, research symposia, and targeted pilot funding. CB has
taken advantage of historical institutional strengths in catchment area priorities, GI, and hematologic cancers,
with recruitment strengthening our research on breast and tobacco-related cancers. CB members have
expertise that can be organized into four discipline-based themes: 1) cancer metastasis and tumor
microenvironment; 2) DNA damage/repair and regulation; 3) stem cell biology; and 4) cell signaling pathways."
10906330,"CANCER PREVENTION AND CONTROL: ABSTRACT
The Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) research program at The University of Kansas Cancer Center
(KUCC) brings together an interdisciplinary team of researchers focused on: 1) developing, testing, and
implementing innovative strategies to modify behaviors that drive cancer risk and disparities in cancer
incidence (Population-Level Primary Prevention); 2) identifying biomarker-driven opportunities for cancer
prevention among high-risk individuals with premalignant disease or hereditary cancer risk and testing
interventions to improve detection and modulation of risk biomarkers associated with cancer prevention in
these high-risk patients (High-Risk Prevention); and 3) developing and disseminating behavioral, nutritional,
and clinical support interventions to address the impact of cancer (Survivorship). The 49 members of CPC
come from 23 departments in six schools. They represent a rich mix of expertise, including behavioral science,
neuroscience, primary care, nursing, oncology, epidemiology, economics, translational biology, pharmacology,
communications, biostatistics, and health services research. Program members are supported by $13.3M in
total annual funds, including $3.8M from the National Cancer Institute. Currently, 69% of CPC members are
principal investigators on externally funded cancer research grants. CPC program activities support both intra-
and inter-programmatic interactions through translational research seminars, a visiting scholar program, and
cancer care delivery and equity, tobacco control, implementation science, and health services research
working groups. These activities have fostered intra- and inter-programmatic productivity, resulting in 225
articles published by CPC members in 2020, of which 20% had inter-programmatic, 32% had intra-
programmatic, and 67% had external collaborations.
The work in CPC begins and ends with the needs of the KUCC catchment area. CPC members have shown
remarkable success in developing the infrastructure to conduct cancer prevention and control research in our
region among rural, African American, Hispanic, and American Indian communities and individuals in the
criminal justice system. A strong mentorship program places a significant focus on training. Seven CPC
trainees received more than $1.2M in extramural training grant support in 2020 alone; CPC members have
demonstrated a 9.2-fold return from CCSG Developmental Funds and a 23.3-fold return from KUCC Pilot
Projects. The shared work of CPC members has led to: a better understanding of the cancer control needs in
the KUCC catchment area; improved capacity to analyze the needs of affected and at-risk populations;
identification of novel pre-cancerous models and new biomarkers; improved strategies to detect and prevent
cancer in high-risk patients; better strategies for the design and delivery of cancer prevention and control
messages; and improved delivery of tobacco control, cancer screening, physical activity, obesity, and
survivorship programs at the level of both the clinical practice and the community-at-large."
10906331,"The Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design (BERD) Core has a strong track record of providing
assistance with statistics and research design to investigators in West Virginia. In the previous funding cycle,
BERD provided over 3000 unique services to over 1200 investigators, in the areas of biostatistics, epidemiology,
research design, custom data sets, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), REDCap assistance, and more. In
the next funding cycle, BERD will expand the depth and breadth of services available to researchers without
compromising the quality, accessibility, and timeliness of their expert assistance. A crucial area of expansion will
be the Small Area Estimation Unit (SAEU) (AIM 1). Given West Virginia’s small, rural population, it is imperative
to have a group providing statistical expertise to minimize bias in small sample size studies. Additionally, the
expertise in GIS will be expanded. A GIS server installed in collaboration with ESRI is the first server of its kind
to be utilized at an academic institution in North America. This server will allow for more complex and
technologically integrated spatial analyses. BERD will be enhancing not only the analytic capabilities of WVCTSI,
but also the technical capabilities. The BERD core will be utilizing the newly-acquired High-Performance
Computing (HPC) cluster and accompanying secure enclave, to provide a space to run resource-intensive big
data analyses. This HPC cluster will also support BERD’s expansion in the areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
Machine Learning (ML),and predictive modeling, developing the next generation of technological tools to impact
clinical research and enhancing personalized medicine (AIM 2). Finally, as BERD increases researcher access
to cutting-edge methods and technologies, a parallel goal is to increase the knowledge and capabilities of the
researchers at WVCTSI institutions (AIM 3). In order to utilize GIS, HPC, and AI/ML offerings to their fullest
potential, it is essential to have mechanisms in place for researchers to become familiar with these systems.
Therefore, BERD will develop workshops, training courses, and certification opportunities in these areas to
facilitate researcher independence and knowledge expansion. Ultimately, over the next funding cycle, the
resources of the BERD core will lead to increased research opportunity and productivity."
10906333,"The Community Engagement and Outreach (CEO) Core of the West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science
Institute (WVCTSI) brings patients, providers, and community members together, to ensure that the Institute’s
research agenda reflects the health priorities of rural communities, and that study findings and recommendations
inform practical, sustainable, and scalable strategies to promote health. The CEO Core has developed a critically
important statewide infrastructure in West Virginia (WV), providing a platform for engaging communities,
providers, and patients to participate as comprehensive research partners. The CEO Core Aims are designed to
synergistically address cross-cutting themes including rural health, diversity, inclusion and equity, and
addressing the rural research pipeline The CEO Core is well-positioned to build upon its existing operations and
resources to provide innovative services that increase community access to and participation through cutting-
edge science. We will accomplish these Aims by establishing the first Implementation Science Center (ISC) in
WV (Aim 1). The ISC is where academicians, researchers, healthcare providers, and community members
receive the services and expertise needed to expand ideas into fundable implementation projects. Aim 1 success
will result in the recruitment of an implementation scientist, and technical assistance provided by the CEO core,
managing readiness, and sustainability. For Aim 2, the CEO Core will engage rural populations in research
through three broad categories: 1) increased access to evidence-based interventions and community-based
participatory research through community forums, 2) a focus on experiential learning through collaboration with
the WV Area Health Education Centers(WV AHEC) Rural Community Health Scholars (RCH) Program, and 3)
support the development of a mobile clinical trials unit (MCTU)to increase access for rural populations through
a partnership with the Clinical Research Resources & Facilities (CRRF) Core. Aim 3 activities will focus on the
dissemination of research findings to address the disconnect between scientific discovery and community
implementation of evidence-based practices in rural areas. This will be accomplished by: 1) improving rural
community clinic dissemination by hosting 1-2 Community ECHOs per year; 2) improving community
dissemination through the development of a CEO dissemination plan; and 3) assisting early-stage and
community-based investigators by partnering with the Professional Development Core, to provide trainings to
assist investigators in developing specific project plans for dissemination. Successful completion of the
aforementioned specific aims will increase the speed of translation from the bench to the community, increase
uptake of interventions, and combat the 2021 culture of misinformation."
10906334,"DRUG DISCOVERY, DELIVERY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS: ABSTRACT
The Drug Discovery, Delivery and Experimental Therapeutics (D3ET) research program integrates a broad
range of research areas that contribute to the discovery of new cancer therapeutic agents as well as novel
approaches to effective drug delivery; the development of drug products and diagnostics for the treatment and
prevention of cancer; and the evaluation of these medical innovations in hypothesis-driven experimental
therapeutics trials. D3ET is organized around three central, highly integrated scientific themes: 1) Drug
Discovery and Delivery; 2) Drug and Diagnostic Development; and 3) Evaluation of New Cancer Treatment
Strategies in Experimental Therapeutic Trials. D3ET has 62 members, including 36 full and 26 associate
members. Membership reflects a range of senior and early stage investigators with 27 Professors, 13
Associate Professors and 20 Assistant Professors and two key shared resource personnel. D3ET members
are drawn from 25 departments across Children’s Mercy (CM), the University of Kansas in Lawrence (KU-L),
and the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City (KUMC), providing a rich environment for
discipline diversity and team science.
During the reporting period (CY20), 85% of program members have cancer relevant, externally funded
research grants. From 2016-2020, the D3ET program achieved a strong and growing cancer-focused research
portfolio. D3ET members have doubled funding (increase of $15M) over the past five years with $7M of this
increase comprised of peer-reviewed funding and $8M of non-peer reviewed funding, along with a near
doubling of NCI-sponsored direct funding. D3ET has successfully advanced five KU-invented cancer
therapeutic agents (See Table 4), to clinical trials over the past four years. The D3ET program has made
substantial progress in publishing its research and increasing intra-programmatic (33%) and inter-
programmatic (21%) collaborations. Between 2016 and 2020, D3ET members published 902 cancer-relevant
publications (an average of 14.5 publications per member), including 142 high-impact publications in journals
with impact factors ≥ 10.0 (16%). D3ET is jointly led by John A. Taylor, MD, MS (KUMC), Priyanka Sharma,
MD (KUMC), and Dan A. Dixon, PhD (KU-L), who bring complementary scientific expertise in drug discovery,
development and experimental therapeutics and strong track records of mentorship. This highly interactive
leadership team meets biweekly with Scott Weir, PharmD, PhD (KUMC), Associate Director for Translational
Research, to ensure seamless integration with broader cancer center goals and initiatives."
10906335,"The Pilot Project Program (PPP) is crucial to the development and support of clinical and translational research
for the West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute (WVCTSI). The PPP provides the infrastructure
to set early-stage investigators (ESIs) on the path that will provide meaningful research to positively impact West
Virginians, in rapidly advancing and changing health-related fields. While qualified researchers exist within the
state, the PPP provides a platform to match expertise within and across WVCTSI partner institutions. To
accomplish its goals, the PPP will (1) provide innovative funding mechanisms to facilitate clinical and translational
research, (2) work to improve the quality and impact of clinical and translational research in the state, and (3)
stimulate ESI development. Toward these goals, the PPP will provide several funding mechanisms to enhance
clinical and translational research with the Open Grant serving as a primary mechanism for supporting
investigator-initiated research. Two new PPP funding opportunities will establish team science-based initiatives
(Bench-to-Bedside Grants) and create a new career development initiative through the Fellows Grant program.
The new Rapid Response Grant will allow for flexibility in targeting emerging health issues within the state and
getting funding to meritorious projects in a shortened time frame. Promoting the development and
commercialization of new medically-related technology is the focus of the novel Launch Grant program, with the
Jumpstart Grant providing funding to complete a manuscript or obtain key preliminary data for an extramural
grant application. Applications for PPP funding mechanisms will receive priority if they are focused on WVCTSI
health priority areas, are led by an ESI and/or a clinician, are from a partner site, or use the Practice-Based
Research Network. Incentives will be provided for applications that provide a medical student research
experience. We will also provide an A1 mechanism whereby investigators with promising projects that fall short
of the funding line will be provided mentoring and the opportunity to resubmit an improved proposal. In addition,
improving the success rate of pilot projects submitted by partner institution investigators is a priority. Indeed, the
trust and camaraderie developed among WVCTSI partner institutions will facilitate implementation of impactful
WV science through the PPP. The PPP will work synergistically with other WVCTSI Cores to mentor and train
network investigators in clinical and translational research to improve the quality and impact of clinical and
translational research in West Virginia and increase the success of WVCTSI investigators in securing extramural
funding."
10906336,"COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT: ABSTRACT
Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) efforts are central to The University of Kansas Cancer Center
(KUCC) achieving its mission to reduce the cancer burden in our catchment area (CA). COE is led by Ronald
Chen, MD, MPH, Associate Director for Health Equity, and guided by the CA Steering Committee which
includes KUCC leaders and community stakeholders. Hope Krebill, MSW, BSN, RN, serves as Assistant
Director for Outreach and Executive Director of the Masonic Cancer Alliance (MCA), which implements COE
activities throughout the CA. The KUCC CA consists of the state of Kansas and 18 counties in western Missouri,
a total of 123 counties and 4.5M population; 78% of counties and 25% of population are rural. Aim 1: Identify,
monitor, and evaluate the cancer burden and needs, and KUCC impact, in the CA. KUCC has developed
a database called OPTIK (Organize and Prioritize Trends to Inform KUCC), which is used to monitor cancer
incidence, mortality, screening, and risk behaviors in the CA. These data are reviewed by the KUCC
Community Advisory Board and the CA Steering Committee. KUCC selected priorities with the CA Steering
Committee and Community Advisory Board input, which are: obesity, tobacco-related cancers, prostate
cancer, breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancers, and hematological cancers. There is an additional focus on
rural patients given the make-up of our CA. Aim 2: Engage stakeholders to stimulate cancer research and
control activities. COE works with an extensive infrastructure creating bi-directional communication between
KUCC and diverse stakeholders including patients, clinical providers, and hospitals throughout the CA, which
helps KUCC set priorities for cancer research and control activities, and also collaborate in these activities to
affect individuals throughout the catchment area. Aim 3: Catalyze research that addresses high-priority
cancers and issues specifically relevant to the CA and as guided by community stakeholders to
improve health equity. COE plays a critical role in stimulating and supporting KUCC research in four
important ways: 1) By facilitating bi-directional communication with community members to define KUCC
priority areas and communicating these priorities to KUCC program leaders and members in order to focus
research activities toward these priorities; 2) by fostering collaborations between KUCC researchers and
community collaborators, and training researchers on community-engaged research; 3) by driving continued
efforts for KUCC to focus on the unique needs of rural cancer patients in the CA; and 4) by creating and
operationally supporting an infrastructure throughout the CA that can be leveraged for research. Aim 4: Drive,
disseminate and implement cancer control activities and policies to reduce cancer burden in the CA in
collaboration with community stakeholders. These activities include cancer screenings, implementation of
evidence-based interventions, public education, supporting community cancer centers, and influencing health
policy. A detailed evaluation framework and future directions will enhance efforts related to these specific aims."
10906338,"The Tracking and Evaluation (TE) Core of the West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute
(WVCTSI) uses collaborative capacity building evaluation and accountability frameworks to assist all cores in
their evaluation and data-based decision-making processes, empowering core personnel to recognize and
address challenges to productivity and desired outcomes. No evaluation entity with the infrastructure and
resources to accomplish programmatic evaluation at this scale existed here prior to WVCTSI funding. During
Years 1-10, TE Core established robust systems and processes to provide leadership and personnel with
objective performance data to assess progress toward Aim achievement. In this second renewal application, TE
proposes innovative new initiatives to enhance the WVCTSI’s capacity to evaluate its progress, maximizing
accountability and programmatic improvement. These efforts will be accomplished through the following specific
aims: 1) Leverage creative existing platforms to further increase capacity among WVCTSI personnel outside of
TE Core to rapidly translate evaluation findings to practice through innovative evaluation data science resources
and regular evaluation data use training workshops; 2) Drive quality improvements in WVCTSI services and
support through investigator-centric programmatic evaluation that enables clinical/translational (C/T) investigator
productivity; and 3) Develop and a disseminate portable toolkit of programmatic evaluation models that drive
continuous quality improvement and demonstrate statewide impact on rural health and healthcare. For aim 1,
TE Core will increase the capacity of WVCTSI personnel to rapidly translate evaluation findings to practice by
identifying recurring evaluation data needs and developing user-friendly web-based data science resources that
provide data visualizations in near real-time and also providing regular training in utilization of these resources
and data-based evaluative thinking. For aim 2, TE Core will develop a central database logging every instance
of service delivery to investigators and associating that data with all other investigator data points. Analyses of
these data will guide qualitative work with investigators to identify and remove barriers to their productivity
through improved services and service delivery by all cores. For aim 3, TE Core will develop and package for
portability two evaluation data models that focus on a) PBRN connectivity and impact on rural health and
healthcare, and b) hub-and-spoke knowledge transmission to support rural health care providers and positively
impact their patients. Three key innovations involve: a) sophisticated data science tools and evaluation capacity
building to rapidly translate evaluation findings to practice, b) driving quality improvement through investigator-
centric programmatic evaluation, and c) disseminating a portable toolkit for programmatic evaluation in rural
health and healthcare settings. Integrating these key innovations into the programmatic evaluation developed
during the current WVCTSI funding cycle will allow rapid transformation of WVCTSI toward sustainability and
accomplishment of the overall programmatic goals of this application."

10906340,"The Technology and Resources for Core Laboratories Core (Technology Core) of the West Virginia Clinical and
Translational Science Institute (WVCTSI) supports research infrastructure critical for rapid translation of
innovation to positively impact the health of West Virginians. Importantly, the Technology Core leverages the
significant previous IDeA investment in West Virginia, while bringing exciting innovation to support clinical and
translational (C/T) investigators’ efforts. Resources described in this Core are essential in providing
infrastructure to engage and train C/T scientists with a focus on essential pipeline development as well as
diversity of the future generation of C/T investigators. The Technology Core will leverage a strong statewide
infrastructure through partnerships with West Virginia University (WVU), Marshall University (MU), NIOSH and
the WV DHHR that has been strengthened during the previous funding period. New technical capacity will be
provided to investigators and their trainees to support interrogation of current, acute, problems as well as being
positioned to take on emerging and future public health crises. The capacity to be nimble in the scope and focus
of research that can be supported, both technically and intellectually, is central to the Core. The specific aims
that will operationalize our progress towards these goals include to: (1) develop and optimize molecular and
protein-based diagnostic assays and support lead compound optimization via an automated pipeline in the newly
established Molecular Medicine Laboratory (MML), (2) enable investigations of the health effects of inhalation
exposures relevant to rural communities via the state of the art inhalation toxicology facility (iTox) and (3) support
translational investigations of pathogens underlying emerging infectious diseases. Focus across the Technology
Core is provided by tethering all activities to WVCTSI priority health areas to avoid diffusion of investment and
energy, and maximize investment to achieve significant and measurable outcomes. Relevance is obtained by
absolute diligence in the design and focus of each aim connecting to a clinical application. In combination, this
results in impact on our understanding of specific diseases of interest, and the potential to impact positively on
the health of West Virginians while contributing to the broader scientific community."
10906342,"Rural Americans are more likely to die from cancer, heart disease, stroke, chronic lung diseases, and even
SARS-CoV-2 infection than persons living in urban areas, yet rural populations are consistently
underrepresented in clinical trials. Clinical research focused on the health issues confronting diverse rural
populations is critical to addressing and remediating West Virginia’s (WV) significant health disparities. The
overall goal of the Clinical Research Resources and Facilities (CRRF) Core is to overcome obstacles to clinical
study participation faced by rural residents while supporting the development of the next generation of clinical
trialists and ensuring the highest quality of study conduct. Building on the considerable CRRF Core
achievements in Years 6-10 that included implementation of the Clinical Trials Center of Excellence (COE),
we will accomplish the overall goal by achieving three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 is to develop
comprehensive infrastructure and collaborations across WV that facilitate clinical study participation among
diverse rural populations. We will accomplish this aim using several strategies. Two new clinical trials partners,
Berkeley Medical Center/WVU Eastern Campus, located in WV’s eastern panhandle, and the Veterans Affairs
(VA) facility in Huntington, expand the geographic footprint of WVCTSI clinical trials. Existing clinical trials
centers at established WVCTSI partners, Marshall University and Charleston Area Medical Center, will be more
closely aligned under the COE umbrella through the establishment of the WVCTSI Clinical Trials Council.
Importantly, our new National Institutes of Health-funded mobile clinical trials unit, a 39-foot Winnebago
customized to include two exam rooms and laboratory space, will provide WVCTSI investigators the ability to
enroll study participants in the farthest corners of rural WV. Finally, we will implement and promote telehealth
as a clinical research platform to reach potential participants across the state. Specific Aim 2 will build strong
clinical research teams by providing the next generation of clinical trialists with the skills and qualifications to
effectively lead research teams. The Principal Investigators’ (PI) Academy, established in the current funding
cycle, will provide a forum for discussion of clinical trial issues and mentoring of early-stage investigators. To
address a critical shortage of study coordinators in WV, we will develop and implement an online certificate
program in clinical trial coordination, in collaboration with the WVU School of Nursing. In Specific Aim 3 we
will develop and implement a standardized set of performance metrics across all WVCTSI clinical trial sites to
drive clinical trial efficiency and quality. As site performance excellence is critical to the safety of participants
and the success of any clinical trial, we will implement a menu of metrics to facilitate timely identification and
resolution of potential problems that may affect participant safety, study efficiency, and/or study impact. The
metrics will be reviewed and agreed upon by the WVCTSI Clinical Trials Council."
10906345,"CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT: ABSTRACT
The Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) function at The University of Kansas Cancer Center
(KUCC) resides within the Clinical Trials Office (CTO). The CTO, led by Tara Lin, MD (CTO Medical Director)
and Natalie Streeter (Assistant Vice Chancellor and Chief Operating Officer, Clinical Research, Strategy and
Operations) under the direction of Weijing Sun, MD, FACP (AD for Clinical Research), provides
comprehensive support services that span the life cycle of cancer clinical trials from concept through
manuscript. The CTO provides centralized protocol management and reporting, with strong emphasis on data
integrity, protocol compliance, education and training of CTO staff and investigators, and timelines for rapid
trial submission and activation. The CTO supports KUCC investigators through the Disease Working Groups
(DWG) to develop research portfolios that meet the needs of our catchment area. Enhancements to CTO
operations enabled the growth of clinical research, with particular focus on investigator-initiated trials (IITs),
early phase clinical trials and trials for underserved and rural populations. Cancer Center Program Leaders are
integrated into CTO committees including the Clinical Research Steering Committee and IIT Steering
Committee so that CTO functions best serve the needs of the individual programs and promote translation of
KUCC science to the clinic. The CTO expansion and staff specialization has enabled a steady increase in
clinical trial accrual. From 2016-2020, there were 13,575 accruals onto interventional, observational, and
ancillary/correlative studies. Accrual to interventional treatment clinical trials increased by 61% since the last
grant period (3,965 accruals in 2016-2020 verses 2,462 in 2011-2015). Accrual to NCTN protocols increased
overall by 111% (1,581 accruals in 2016-2020; 750 from 2011-2015). Our achievements led to our recognition
as an NCTN “High-Performing Site,” and awards of an NCORP grant and CATCH UP 2020 supplement
focused on rural and underserved populations. Our commitment to increase clinical trial outreach to local
community sites and the Masonic Cancer Alliance (MCA, network across Kansas and Missouri) resulted in
increased accruals by 62% since the last grant cycle (404 accruals in 2016-2020; 506 accruals in 2011-2015).
The creation of a dedicated IIT team within the CTO and the IIT Steering Committee resulted in an increase in
accruals to interventional treatment IITs by 151% since the prior grant cycle (1,645 accruals in 2016-2020; 656
in 2011-2015). In summary, the CTO has efficiently leveraged its resources to support the growth of clinical
research at KUCC, with a particular emphasis on developing IITs and bringing innovative and impactful clinical
trials to meet the needs of patients within our catchment area."
10906347,"PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM: ABSTRACT
The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) oversees and ensures the scientific merit, appropriate
resourcing, and progress of all cancer-related clinical studies at The University of Kansas Cancer Center
(KUCC) and its consortium partners. PRMS evaluation occurs prior to submission to the Institutional Review
Board (IRB), and does not overlap with its responsibilities. The PRMS has two stages of review: 1) the
Disease Working Groups (DWG; report to the Associate Director (AD) for Clinical Research, Weijing Sun,
MD, FACP; and the Executive Resourcing Committee (ERC; Tara Lin, MD, Chair, reports to AD for Clinical
Research); and 2) the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC; Qamar Khan, MD, Chair, reports
to the Deputy Director, Andrew Godwin, PhD). DWGs set priorities and portfolio needs, ERC evaluates
feasibility and resources, and PRMC performs an independent scientific review. This two-stage process is
formally recorded to maintain prompt activation of high priority studies and aligns with the CCSG guidelines.
The PRMS process is aligned to ensure protocols receive high-quality peer-review and monitoring, and the
research portfolio is consistent with KUCC clinical research priorities and catchment area needs. The 16
DWGs meet monthly for the initial review of scientific merit and available patient resources. The DWGs use a
scoring system to prioritize studies, including disease specific needs. Highest priority is given to funded
investigator-initiated, peer-reviewed trial proposals. DWG co-chairs are appointed by the AD for Clinical
Research. Although the DWG composition is rich in clinicians focused on treatment trials and primarily Drug
Discovery, Delivery and Experimental Therapeutics program members, members of Cancer Prevention and
Control and Cancer Biology are also part of the DWGs. DWGs are evaluated yearly by the AD for Clinical
Research for proportion of trials that are IIT and/or national, quality, translational nature of interventional trials,
trial accrual, and national meeting presentations and publications. This data is used to further support areas of
need as well as allocate staffing resources to growing and productive teams. The ERC reviews trial feasibility
and resource assessment, protocol resource requirements, and available funding. The CTO sends DWG/ERC
approved studies to the PRMC for scientific review. The PRMC performs independent scientific and
biostatistical reviews, and adequacy of the data safety monitoring. The PRMC also monitors active protocols at
least annually for scientific progress and accruals and terminates studies as appropriate. In 2020, the PRMC
reviewed 287 new studies, 259 were approved and 15 were tabled and nine disapproved. In 2020, the PRMC
reviewed 403 ongoing studies, 49 were placed on probation and 15 were terminated. In August 2020, PRMS
was integrated into the Velos eResearch Clinical Trial Management System resulting in improved tracking of
the protocols, enhanced communication between the stages of protocol review and efficient collection of
metrics on PRMS activities."

The Biospecimen Shared Resource (BSR), led by Andrew K. Godwin, PhD (Founding Director, BSR; Deputy
Director, KUCC, and D3ET member), and by Rashna Madan, MBBS, FCAP, FASCP (Assistant Director,
BSR), plays a vital role in The University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC) by its ethical collection, storage,
annotation, and distribution of high-quality human biospecimens, such as fresh/fresh-frozen tumor tissues of
varying histology and bodily fluids (e.g., blood, bone marrow, saliva, urine, ascites fluids), which are essential
to support translational research and investigator-initiated studies. The BSR also provides expert
histopathology support and combines the expertise of pathologists, translational researchers, and technical
personnel to produce a comprehensive and focused approach to support the research activities at KUCC. The
BSR, rated “exceptional to outstanding” in 2017, continues to evolve to meet the ever-expanding and diverse
needs of our KUCC members for highly annotated clinical samples. Additionally, tissue biospecimen collection
is facilitated by pathology assistants, residents and fellows at the KU Hospital and the Indian Creek Campus
(ICC) as part of The University of Kansas Health System’s (TUKHS) commitment to the BSR. The BSR is fully
equipped for biospecimen collection, processing, and distribution, and thus, the BSR adheres to the OSHA
laboratory standards for handling cryogens, ISBER Best Practice for Repositories, and NCI Best Practices for
Biospecimen Resources, and has developed Standard Operating Procedures to govern each of these
processes. The collection, processing, and distribution of specimens by the BSR staff has grown substantially
over the funding period and now includes collections of pediatric specimens from ICC and Children’s Mercy
(CM) and underserved populations from the satellite biospecimen bank at Truman Medical Center (TMC), a
member of the Masonic Cancer Alliance (MCA) and the largest safety-net provider in the Kansas City
Metropolitan area. Since founding the CCSG BSR in 2011, we have enrolled 51,916 consented individuals and
supported the banking of 4,795 participants for investigator-initiated studies resulting in regular usage of de-
identified biospecimens and matching clinical data. During the current grant cycle (2016-2020), the BSR
provided key services in support of 150 publications (57 papers ≥ 10 impact factor), 96 unique cancer center
members, and >35 NIH/NIGMS/NCI grants and contracts including, 1 K01, 1 R00, 12 R01s, 1 R03, 6 R21s, 1
R33, 1 R35, 2 R43, 2 P20, 1 P30, 1 P41, 2 U01, TCGA 13XS194, & CPTAC 14X215, 16x257, 19x139 and 311
clinical trials. In the reporting year (2020), the BRS supported 82 different users (54 KUCC members across all
three programs, of which 85% were funded and 28 non-members, including 16 cancer-focused researchers
nationally). The proposed budget of the BSR (year 11) is $1,511,949, yet the CCSG request is $118,342. As
such, the BSR leverages grants, contracts, user fees, and extensive institutional support and seeks only 7.8%
support from CCSG funds."
10906351,"BIOSTATISTICS AND INFORMATICS SHARED RESOURCE (BISR): ABSTRACT
The Biostatistics and Informatics Shared Resource (BISR) plays an essential role in the research activities of
The University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC) by supporting the data science needs of KUCC investigators.
The BISR is co-led by Byron Gajewski (CPC), PhD, and Devin Koestler (CB), PhD, both accomplished
biostatisticians with a long-standing commitment to cross-disciplinary collaborations. The BISR includes 19
faculty members with specialized cancer biostatistics research expertise, 13 technical support staff and
postdoctoral fellows, and three administrative staff members who provide additional technical and
administrative expertise, adding efficiency to the resource. The BISR assists KUCC investigators by providing
guidance and direction in study design, statistical oversight and analyses, clinical research informatics and
data management, electronic data collection, bioinformatics, complex data set (statistical ‘omics) analysis, and
investigator-initiated clinical trials.
The BISR consists of faculty and staff whose diverse expertise and skill sets span the areas of biostatistics,
bioinformatics, and informatics. The considerable overlap between these three areas allows researchers to
work with a single shared resource for their data collection, analytics, and statistical analysis needs. The
synergy between the areas that encompass “data science” enables the BISR to support a wide range of quality
services in a timely and cost-effective manner. To support the research activities of KUCC members, the
specific aims of this resource are to: 1) provide study design and statistical support and expertise; 2) provide
bioinformatics and statistical genetics support and expertise; 3) provide informatics expertise for data collection
and management, as well as develop and support ongoing research enabling technologies, platforms, and
tools; and 4) educate students, fellows and faculty members of KUCC on data science, reproducible research
ideas, and methods used in cancer research. From 2016-2020, the BISR supported 69, 60, 85, 80, and 78
KUCC members respectively. In 2020, the breakdown was 18, 33, and 27 members from Cancer Biology,
Cancer Prevention and Control, and Drug Discovery, Delivery and Experimental Therapeutics, respectively, on
89 grant applications (submissions and resubmissions) and 161 projects (ongoing grants, IITs, and other
projects). In addition, the BISR supported 31 non-member cancer researchers in 2020. For all cancer-related
projects, the BISR supported 340 grant applications plus projects in 2020. In 2021, CCSG funding accounts for
~10% of the BISR budget, with an annual direct support return on investment of approximately $0.6M dollars in
external funding to support BISR faculty and staff (31% of BISR support)."
10906353,"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SHARED RESOURCE (CPSR): ABSTRACT
The first aim of The University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC) is to “Leverage unique assets to transform
research discoveries from the laboratory and the clinic to drive new anticancer therapeutic
development”. The Clinical Pharmacology Shared Resource (CPSR) provides critical technical and scientific
support in clinical pharmacology that is absolutely required to achieve this aim. The overarching goal of the
CPSR is to provide support to all KUCC investigators and their research teams throughout the lifecycle
of a hypothesis-driven investigator-initiated clinical trial (IIT), from early development of trial concept
through publication and follow-on grant application. The CPSR provides guidance to our investigators at
no cost in dose, analyte and matrix selection, design of sampling schemes, pharmacodynamic endpoints,
preparation of clinical trial protocols and data analysis plans, preparation of study-specific laboratory manuals,
as well as PK and PK/PD data analysis and reporting. Once activated, the CPSR provides GXP-compliant
sample acquisition, processing, short-term storage, and transfer of samples to study-defined sites for analysis.
The CPSR provides validated and SOP-driven analysis of trial samples for identification and quantification of
drugs, metabolites, and biomarkers using LC-MS/MS, biochemical, and immunochemical methods. Drug and
biomarker data, whether generated in the CPSR or from other laboratories, then are used for parametric and
nonparametric PK data analysis, PK/PD modeling, and population pharmacokinetics. In response to the
needs of our investigators as well as growth in the KUCC research portfolio over the current funding
period, we have and will continue to expand our range of available technologies and services required.
Based on project demands for greater quantitative sensitivity, structural elucidation of drug metabolites, and for
quantification of therapeutic and biomarker proteins, the CPSR is acquiring new LC-MS/MS instrumentation
and expanding its capabilities in immunochemical methods. The CPSR works extensively with KUCC members
through the IIT Steering Committee as well as the Disease Working Groups to identify opportunities to
incorporate clinical pharmacology objectives into clinical trials. The CPSR not only provides direct scientific and
technical support for the design, but also enhances productivity and quality of clinical research by educating all
members of the research team on the goals of clinical pharmacology and the interactions between team
members to achieve these goals. In short, the goal of the CPSR is to provide guidance and technical support
to KUCC transdisciplinary teams across research programs to ensure that our IITs evaluate new cancer
therapeutic and prevention agents in patients, optimize the utilization of existing anticancer agents, identify
new cancer therapeutic and prevention indications for FDA-approved non-cancer drugs, and define the basis
for variability in therapeutic and toxic responses observed in patients."

The University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) Flow Core was founded through an NIGMS-funded COBRE
program (P20RR016443/P30GM103326) in 2006. The Flow Core quickly grew to be an essential component
of the infrastructure of the KUMC research community, as well as The University of Kansas Cancer Center
(KUCC). With over one-third of Core users being Cancer Center members, the Flow Core was elevated to a
Cancer Center Shared Resource in 2018 after review by Matthew Mayo, PhD, MBA, FASA, Associate Director
for Shared Resources. and Cancer Center leadership. The mission of the Flow Cytometry Shared Resource
(FCSR) is to provide access to state-of-the-art flow cytometry and related technologies to all KUCC members.
The FCSR is led by the Scientific Director, Mary Markiewicz, PhD (CB), and maintains two-full time staff, a
Technical Director, Richard Hastings, MS, and a Research Assistant, Tykeemi Manor, BS. The FSCR houses
a BD LSR II and Attune NxT for cell analysis and a BD FACSAria IIIu for cell sorting. In addition, the FCSR
houses a Luminex 200 for multiplex analysis of cytokines, chemokines, and other small molecules. The FCSR
aids investigators in experimental design, protocol development, sample preparation, data acquisition, and
data analysis. Additionally, the FCSR has strong procedures in place for quality assurance, training,
scheduling, data storage, and data analysis. Over the past three years, the FCSR provided key services in
support of 25 publications to KUCC members (five papers ≥ 10 journal impact factor), 41 unique users, and
four NIH/NIGMS/NCI grants, one DOD grant, and four private foundation awards, and was essential to analysis
of human samples for correlative studies from an NCI-funded clinical trial (R37CA218118, NCT01868087). In
the reporting year (2020), the FCSR supported 34 different users (28 KUCC members from all three research
programs, of which 75% were funded and six non-members). The proposed budget of the FCSR (Year 11) is
$283,970, yet the CCSG request is $15,014. As such, the FCSR leverages grants, contracts, user fees, and
extensive institutional support and seeks only 5% support from CCSG funds."
10906357,"LEAD DEVELOPMENT AND OPTIMIZATION SHARED RESOURCE (LDOSR): ABSTRACT
The Lead Development and Optimization Shared Resource (LDOSR) is a shared resource of The University of
Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC), composed of three component laboratories located on the KU Lawrence West
Campus: High-Throughput Screening (HTS), Medicinal Chemistry (MDCM) and the Biopharmaceutical
Innovation and Optimization Center (BIOC). LDOSR provides preferred access to KUCC members to
accelerate projects from drug-target discovery through high-throughput screening, compound hit prioritization,
secondary in vitro confirmatory assays, medical chemistry optimization, in vitro pharmacology testing, in vivo
pharmacokinetics, and drug delivery formulations for in vivo preclinical proof-of-concept testing. The activities
involved with the generation, evaluation, and optimization of drug candidates is an iterative process that
crosses several scientific disciplines. The LDOSR has been structured to optimize services under a single,
easy-to-access umbrella, with oversight from the Director and a team of project managers, allowing projects to
move seamlessly between component laboratories. Comprehensive plans tailored to fit each project’s needs
ensure users get the most relevant data to move their projects forward. Additionally, the LDOSR offers drop-in
ready grant submission and publication language. Over the past five years (2016-2020), the LDOSR has
supported 167 KUCC member projects (~76% were peer-review funded). The LDOSR leverages research
infrastructure established, historically, through internationally recognized medicinal and pharmaceutical
chemistry research conducted by the University of Kansas School of Pharmacy. Added to this is the availability
of industry experienced scientists from former area Pharma and CRO companies. The LDOSR has
successfully recruited top-notch scientists with industry and academic qualifications to lead and staff the three
component laboratories. The LDOSR, working with the Associate Director for Translational Research,
established the Drug Discovery and Development Steering Committee. This translational-research catalyst
provides a forum for KUCC investigators to develop research concepts at the chemistry/biology interface with
support from the LDO laboratories. The LDOSR partners with The Institute for Advancing Medical Innovation to
advance drug discovery projects through early drug development, actively conducting and supporting studies
necessary to enable first-in-human clinical trials. Additionally, LDOSR staff serve on the Investigator-Initiated
Trial Steering Committee, which facilitates evaluation of development candidates in early phase experimental
therapeutics trials conducted by the D3ET research program. Lastly, bioanalytical methods for determination of
drug and metabolite concentrations in preclinical matrices, are transferred to the Clinical Pharmacology Shared
Resource where they are cross-validated in human matrices under GLP conditions to support early phase
clinical trials. The result is a fully integrated, end-to-end translational research function capable of advancing
novel cancer therapeutic agents invented by KUCC members to clinical trials."
10906358,"NUTRITION SHARED RESOURCE: ABSTRACT
The Nutrition Shared Resource (NSR) co-directed by Debra Sullivan, PhD, RD, and Jill Hamilton-Reeves,
PhD, RD, CSO, facilitates an important aspect of addressing the cancer risk factor of obesity as a priority area
for The University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC) by providing support for basic, clinical and population
health research evaluating the effects of nutrition on cancer therapies, cancer prevention and cancer
population health. The NSR offers quantitative measurements of dietary intake, physical activity, nutrition
status/malnutrition assessments, standardized diets, body composition, microbiome, and nutrition literacy.
NSR services also include design and implementation of interventions to adhere to specific diet or physical
activity goals. The NSR provides expertise in oncology nutrition, diet assessment, intervention design, energy
balance, body composition, gut microbiome, and nutrition literacy. The faculty and staff of the NSR oversee the
measurements and/or services as required for each study. NSR maintains licensed copies of the Nutrition Data
System for Research (NDS-R) and Nutrascreen for dietary intake assessments. The NSR maintains software
and instrumentation such as the sliceOmatic, DXA, Bod Pod, Tod Pod, and Pea Pod, and the Bodystat
Quadscan 4000 bioelectrical impedance analyzer to assess body composition across the lifespan or at the
bedside/clinic for cancer therapeutic trials. Handgrip dynamometers and skin carotenoid meters are other
instruments frequently used for nutrition assessments. Services are provided on-site at the KU Clinical
Research Center (CRC), Westwood and KU Hospital locations, as well as via outreach to Masonic Cancer
Alliance (MCA) partners, sites across the KUCC catchment area, and external NCI-designated cancer centers.
The NSR collaborates with communities throughout the catchment area using community screenings and
outreach with special emphasis in underserved and rural populations. The NSR was a key resource for KUCC
adapting obesity as a priority area. The NSR has grown from its inception in 2016 from a developing shared
resource to a full shared resource. During this development phase, NSR annual usage grew from zero to 30
KUCC members with a total of 61 distinct members across all programs. In the reporting year (2020), the
budget of the NSR is $959,579. The NSR has robust peer-supported funding with 83% of the budget supported
by other grants. The NSR trains and educates the next generation of oncology scientists and health care
professionals through collaborative research and outreach efforts with the MCA. The NSR regularly
incorporates trainees at all levels within projects and prioritizes support for early stage investigators."
10906360,"TRANSGENIC AND GENE-TARGETING SHARED RESOURCE (TGTSR): ABSTRACT
Genetically altered models are important tools for the researchers at The University of Kansas Cancer Center
(KUCC). The production and analysis of such models using CRISPR-based genome editing methods, including
mouse, pluripotent stem cell, and tumor cell line models, ultimately leads to a better understanding of the
nature, progression, and functional genomics of tumor formation. Genetically engineered mouse strains also
serve as in vivo models for diagnostics and treatment. The techniques employed to generate genetically
modified animal and cell models require specialized equipment and technical expertise. The Transgenic and
Gene-Targeting Shared Resource (TGTSR) led by Jay L. Vivian, PhD, supports members of KUCC by
providing centralized and comprehensive technical services for the production of novel genetically engineered
rodents and cell lines. The TGTSR uses cutting-edge methods, state-of-the-art instrumentation, and novel
reagents for the generation of these models. Genome editing methods are central to the activities of the
TGTSR, including a pipeline for the design and optimized use of CRISPR reagents in embryo and cell models.
The expertise of the TGTSR Director and staff is leveraged in all phases of the generation of novel genetically
engineered models, from the initial experimental design stage through model generation, molecular
characterization, expansion, genotyping, and cryopreservation. This extensively used shared resource
supported 28 KUCC users in CY2020, and 49 unique KUCC members were supported by the TGTSR in the
previous funding period, demonstrating the broad use of this shared resource. The five full-time staff members
of the TGTSR include the coordinated efforts between staff at both the University of Kansas Medical Center
(KUMC) and Children’s Mercy Kansas City (CM) campuses, allowing for staff expansion in response to
increased use by KUCC members. By centralizing operations and reagents between KUCC consortium
members, all services are available to KUCC investigators on all campuses at a greatly reduced time and cost.
The Cancer Center support of the TGTSR allows for the development of specific initiatives relevant to cancer
research. For example, certain transgenic methods and mutations are particularly relevant to cancer studies,
including tissue specific transgene expression and subtle mutations that recapitulate clinically identified
variants and somatic mutations. Strategic investments by the KUCC have allowed for acquisition of new
instrumentation and support to develop novel CRISPR mutagenesis methods in the zygote and in cell lines.
The integration of these continually evolving methods into the ‘toolbox’ of the TGTSR greatly accelerates the
development of animal and cell models of cancer, while also reducing costs to KUCC researchers on all
campuses."
10904435,"Project Summary. The filamentous fungi, or moulds, present a particularly daunting clinical challenge with
high treatment failure rates and intrinsic and/or emerging multi-drug resistance. Currently, only 3 classes of
antifungal drugs are utilized to treat the majority of human fungal infections. We aim to address this significant
and growing human health problem by developing a nonspirocyclic piperidine series (NSP) series of small
molecules with potent antifungal activity that can overcome mould specific antifungal drug resistance in the
complex infection microenvironment. The NSP series was discovered using a high-throughput small molecule
antifungal screen under low oxygen conditions and in the presence or absence of fluconazole with the most
common mould human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. From this novel screen, we identified MBX-7591, a
NSP family small molecule with drug-like properties that displayed potent antifungal activity that is potentiated
under low oxygen conditions. MBX-7591 also potentiates the antifungal activity of fluconazole and other
triazoles against A. fumigatus, which is intrinsically fluconazole resistant. The combination of MBX-7591 and
voriconazole is highly active against azole resistant A. fumigatus isolates. Additional studies revealed that
MBX-7591 has potent antifungal activity against multiple drug resistant mould species including agents of
mucormycoses Rhizopus arrhizus and Mucor circinelloides. Pilot murine invasive pulmonary aspergillosis
model studies reveal a promising safety profile and in vivo efficacy. Based on these exciting results, our
premise is that MBX-7591 analogs represent a promising new generation of safe and in vivo efficacious small
molecules to combat the growing emergence of drug resistant human fungal infections. In aim 1, we will utilize
SAR-driven chemical optimization of the NSP series to synthesize 300 analogs with key drug-like properties
such as solubility. In aim 2, we will evaluate and prioritize NSP analogs in SAR-driving in vitro assays for
potency, selectivity, and ADME properties with the goal of identifying 5-10 analogs with potent MICs against A.
fumigatus, R. arrhizus, and M. circinelloides. In aim 3, we will utilize genetic, biochemical, and chemical biology
approaches to define the molecular target of MBX-7591 and key analogs. In aim 4, we will identify a lead NSP
compound and backup based on tolerability, pharmacokinetic parameters, and efficacy in murine models of
invasive mould infections. Taken together, our proposed studies will further develop an exciting novel small
molecule with infection microenvironment activity against a spectrum of clinically challenging pathogenic
moulds."

research workforce. The National Institutes of Health is concerned by this lack of diversity and has
established a variety of supportive mechanisms to ensure that workforce diversity is representative of
the diversity in American society. One important NIH diversity initiative is the Postbaccalaureate
Research Education Program or PREP. The overall goal of PREP is to develop recent baccalaureate
science graduates from diverse backgrounds under-represented in biomedical sciences so that they
have the necessary knowledge and skills to pursue PhD or MD-PhD degrees in these fields. Case
Western Reserve University was awarded PREP funding beginning in 2007. The program, termed
CasePREP, has been notably successful, matriculating 54 Scholars into upper-tier PhD or MD/PhD
programs across the nation. The current proposal seeks to continue this program by funding eight
Case PREP Scholars each year for an additional 5 years. The key components of CasePREP involve
individually tailored graduate coursework, professional credentials enhancement, well-crafted
experiential skill development, immersion in the PhD student experience, and extensive exposure to
biomedical research. Indeed, Case PREP Scholars complete a one-year apprenticeship in CWRU
School of Medicine faculty laboratories located throughout many of our 14 PhD-granting programs.
PREP mentor laboratories are well funded, dynamic, and led by experienced mentors with substantial
minority training experience. In addition, Case PREP Scholars will complete graduate level
coursework, GRE preparation experiences, professional skills development, and other enrichment
activities. These core developmental experiences are designed to further strengthen a student's
scholarly potential and improve their research skills, ultimately leading to their matriculation into and
completion of rigorous biomedical doctoral degree programs across the nation. Important outcome
assessments will show improved graduate school application credentials, enhanced research and
presentation skills, improved attitudes about research careers, and greater than 75% success rates in
PREP Scholar matriculation into PhD programs and completion of the PhD degree, respectively.
Importantly, one of the main outcomes is for Case PREP to continue improving diversity in the
biomedical PhD programs at CWRU and across the nation."
10880718,"Project Summary/Abstract
This proposal’s long-term goal is to take advantage of the biology of the NR4A family of orphan nuclear hormone
receptors to selectively manipulate antigen-specific T cell responses in immune-mediated diseases.
NR4A members (NUR77, NURR1, and NOR1) are encoded by three genes (Nr4a1-3, respectively) that are
rapidly induced by antigen (Ag) stimulation in lymphocytes. Although they are thought to function as ligand-
independent, constitutively active transcription factors, small molecule agonist and antagonist ligands have been
developed, rendering them druggable. We and others have shown that NR4A TF expression scales with the
intensity of Ag stimulation, and are highly upregulated in thymocytes undergoing negative selection, in regulatory
T cells (Tregs), as well as in self-reactive, anergic, or exhausted T cells. Due to an overlapping expression pattern
and considerable structural homology in their DNA-binding domain, the NR4A TFs exhibit profound functional
redundancy; thymic deletion of multiple - but not individual - NR4A family members (Nr4a1 and Nr4a3 >> Nr4a2,
which is minimally expressed) results in severe Treg deficiency and a “scurfy-like” disease that phenocopies
Foxp3-/- mice. Consequently, it has not been possible previously to unmask additional redundant functions of
this family during thymic selection and in conventional mature CD4 T cells (Tconv). This represents a major gap
in our knowledge that limits full therapeutic exploitation of these factors.
Recently, we took advantage of both conditional genetic and bone marrow chimera strategies in order to preserve
Treg homeostasis. Unexpectedly, mixed chimeras harboring both WT and Nr4a1-/- Nr4a3-/- (DKO) bone marrow
rapidly develop anti-nuclear autoantibodies (ANAs) and a systemic inflammatory disease despite a replete Treg
compartment of largely WT origin. This disease differs qualitatively from that seen in germline DKO mice with
Treg-deficiency, and is B cell-extrinsic. We show that negative selection of DKO thymocytes is profoundly
impaired in a cell-intrinsic manner. Consistent with escape of self-reactive T cells into the periphery, DKO CD4
Tconv cells expressing phenotypic and transcriptional markers of anergy accumulate in these chimeras.
However, these self-reactive DKO cells nevertheless exhibit exaggerated proliferation and IL-2 production,
suggesting that functional anergy is defective. We therefore hypothesize that the NR4A family play cell-intrinsic,
but redundant, roles in both central and peripheral CD4 T cell tolerance. To test this hypothesis:
In our first aim, we propose to define the role of the NR4A family in thymic negative selection in the face of both
ubiquitous and tissue-restricted antigens, and to define the transcriptional targets that contribute to this function.
In our second aim, we propose to isolate NR4A contributions to peripheral T cell tolerance, and to canonical
features of mature CD4 T cell anergy - including impaired signal transduction, cytokine production, and
proliferation. We will use both bulk and single cell genomic approaches to define the mechanism by which the
NR4A family regulates the transcriptome and epigenetic profile of naïve and tolerant CD4 T cells."

Title: Neural Niche in Promoting Brain Metastasis Progression
 Metastatic progression at the brain is a multi-step, evolutionary process that is accomplished through a
consistent interplay between disseminated tumor cells and brain microenvironment - ""the niche"". Despite
significantly improved control of primary tumors, the incidence of brain metastasis is increasing! To reduce
cancer mortality, rationally-designed therapeutics, based on a mechanistic understanding of metastasis in at
the unique brain metastatic niche, are urgently needed for brain metastasis patients. What's the brain
metastatic niche? In the brain microenvironment - the niche - is a myriad of diverse cell types that have been
speculated to contribute to the brain tumor and brain metastasis development, including endothelial cells,
astrocytes, neural stem/progenitor cells (NSC hereafter) and increasingly appreciated brain immune cells.
Despite studies of astrocytes, how do the NSC and its progenies respond to brain metastatic colonization and
regulate brain immune landscape and the metastatic outcome has yet to be systematically investigated. Our
preliminary studies have demonstrated that NSC migrates to colonized tumor cells and NSC is functionally
essential for brain metastasis progression. Intriguingly, ample evidence from in the field of neuroscience
suggests an immune suppressive role of NCS during the brain inflammation. Thus, in this proposal, we
hypothesize that NSC and its progenies' brain metastasis tropism and potentially consequential
immunosuppressive activity could contribute to an immune-suppressive metastatic niche, facilitating brain
metastasis progression. In this proposed study, we will use transgenic mouse models and state-of-the-art
genomics and imaging approach to trace and analyze the role of highly heterogeneous cell types involved in
NSC differentiation and immune suppression and their roles in regulating brain metastatic outgrowth. This
collaborative effort integrating multidisciplinary expertise, including cancer biology, neuroscience,
computational biology, allow us to: 1) examine and trace the NSC differentiation response to brain metastasis
at the phenotypical level; 2) visualize and quantitatively measure the behavior of brain metastatic niche cells
and their transcriptome heterogeneity; 3) examine the mechanism by which neural cells derived from NSC
promotes brain metastasis progression. New in-depth mechanistic insights obtained through basic and pre-
clinical innovative research will pave the way to future brain metastases treatments."
10880618,"SUMMARY
Individual responses to vaccinations are a critical public health issue and mounting evidence suggests that
early life environmental factors may program immune dysregulation that manifests years later. This
developmental origins of health and development (DOHaD) theory posits that dose and timing of early life
immunotoxic environmental exposures can have long-lasting consequences on the trajectory of immune
system function. The immune system begins to develop in utero and, as children age and experience
infections and vaccinations, an ever-expanding repertoire of antibodies become part of their lifelong immune
memory. Yet research on child immune function and its response to ubiquitous immunotoxic metal
exposures—experienced in utero and early in life (0–5 years)—has been largely overlooked.We will address
this knowledge gap in the Mexican PROGRESS study, which has measures of immunotoxic metal exposures
[arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), manganese (Mn), and lead (Pb)] at several key developmental time windows and
from multiple biomatrices (tooth, blood, and urine). We will assess child immune function by measuring
antibody levels at 4, 6, 8, 10–11, and 13–15 years of age in response to scheduled childhood vaccinations
(i.e., measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis). Our preliminary data show that (i) exposure
to individual metals (Cd, Pb) and a metal mixture (As, Cd, Mn, Pb) may result in poorer antibody responses at
age 4 years and that (ii) there are critical windows of susceptibility to As, Mn, and Pb exposures. Additionally,
metal exposures induce systemic oxidative stress (OS) leading to suboptimal immune system function. Given
the pro-oxidant role of metals, we will also quantify cumulative OS via a novel biomarker—mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) heteroplasmy, which reflects OS-induced mtDNA mutation counts accumulating over time. Our initial
data show that prenatal metal exposures are associated with mtDNA heteroplasmy counts at birth. We will
measure mtDNA heteroplasmy at birth and at 8 and 13–15 years of age as a predictor and mediator of
antibody responses. In Aim 1, we will determine the association between exposure to individual metals and
metal mixtures with child antibody responses to vaccination at specific ages and antibody response trajectories
over time. In Aim 2, we will determine critical windows of susceptibility to immunotoxic metals exposure on
child immune system at specific ages and over time. In Aim 3, we will investigate associations between mtDNA
heteroplasmy levels and (i) exposure to individual metals and metal mixtures and (ii) child antibody response to
vaccination at specific ages and antibody response trajectories. We will apply statistical causal modeling
strategies to evaluate the mediating role of mitochondrial biomarkers on the metal–immune system
relationship. Completion of these aims will drive interventions that may help prevent lifelong immune system
dysregulation and related adverse health consequences."

coursework, informal seminars, and a research apprenticeship program grounded in PSC's rich
interdisciplinary environment. Postdoctoral scholars are researchers from a variety of social and health
sciences who benefit from focused exposure to demographic theories and methods for studying population
health. Most postdoctoral trainees are recruited from other universities, and benefit from matches with a new
mentor or mentors, participation in a range of substantive, methodological, and professionalization seminars,
and collaborative research. Michigan trainees are mentored by investigators on some of the most central data
collection projects for studying population dynamics, such as the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. They gain
expertise in the foundations of healthy pregnancies, child and young adult health, and lifelong wellness, with
particular attention to the social and economic determinants of health disparities therein. Our goal is to cultivate
the next generation of health scientists for careers spent integrating knowledge, theory, and tools from
economics, public health, public policy, and sociology to collect and analyze the data needed to address policy
and health-relevant trends in population processes. Leadership: The program will be co-led by Dr. Sarah
Burgard, director of the PSC and NIH-funded sociologist and epidemiologist focused on the social
determinants of socioeconomic, gender and racial/ethnic health disparities, and Dr. Paula Fomby, associate
director and training director of the PSC since 2017 and NIH-funded family demographer. The MPIs are
supported by a training committee of field coordinators from Economics/Public Policy (Dr. Dean Yang), Health
Behavior and Health Education (Dr. Arline Geronimus) and Sociology/Public Policy (Dr. Jeff Morenoff, former
PSC Center Director) all full professors and experienced mentors. Trainees will be mentored by diverse
training faculty from these and related disciplinary departments, researchers with well-funded projects and a
strong record of mentoring and placing trainees in leading academic and governmental research positions. The
training program will be stewarded by the PSC, one of the oldest population centers in the United States, with
a distinguished 60-year record of domestic and international research and training in population dynamics."

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in a wide range of human neurological disorders
including cancer, developmental delay, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disease. While it is known that the
brain is enriched in specific lncRNAs, relatively few have been characterized in terms of function and molecular
mechanism. Our long-term goal is to understand the function and molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in
neurodevelopment. Such fundamental knowledge is critical to understanding how this large aspect of the
noncoding genome regulates brain development and disease. We have taken two approaches for the study of
lncRNA function. The first approach is a “traditional” molecular-genetic study of a brain-specific, evolutionarily
conserved lncRNA that is a potent regulator of neural stem cells (NSCs). In previous studies, we identified a
novel lncRNA transcript that we named Pnky (Pou3f2 intergenic non-koding). In cultured NSCs, either Pnky
transcript knockdown or Pnky conditional knockout (Pnky-cKO) increases neuronal production by ~4-fold.
Pnky is required for proper cortical neurogenesis in vivo, and the expression of Pnky from a BAC transgene
(BAC-Pnky) fully rescues Pnky-deletion – including at the level of the transcriptome – indicating that this
lncRNA functions in trans. Pnky interacts with the splicing regulator PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine tract binding
protein 1) – a critical regulator of neurogenesis from NSCs – and Pnky appears to function in the same
molecular pathway as PTBP1. Preliminary Studies demonstrate that Pnky folds into a compact, monodisperse
state that contains intricate structures including a pseudoknot, which is a structural module known to have
important function in noncoding RNAs. Given these data, we hypothesize that Pnky contains functional
structural modules and regulates the function of PTBP1. Our second approach is to use systematic functional
screens to discover key principles of lncRNA genome function. In Preliminary Studies, we used CRISPRi to
screen in parallel 10,671 lncRNA and 18,905 mRNA genes for roles in the neural induction of NSCs from
human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We also performed CRISPRi perturbation coupled with droplet-
based single-cell RNA-Seq (Perturb-Seq) for hundreds of screen hits. Based on results from these systematic
studies, our working hypothesis is that functional lncRNAs – in comparison to coding genes – are enriched for
roles in “focusing” differentiation to specific neural cell types. To further test this hypothesis, we will study
lncRNA function in human brain organoids and extend our screens to analyze neurogenesis. Determining the
unique functional roles of lncRNAs and coding genes at genome-scale will have important, broad impact on the
interpretation of transcriptomic and epigenomic studies of neurodevelopment. Together, by studying lncRNA
function at the level of individual transcripts and also at genome scale, we expect to gain fundamental insights
into the function of this large aspect of the noncoding genome."

How much does function vary in individuals bearing WT genes and what is the level of function when only one
WT allele is present? Addressing these questions has taken on new relevance in the field of cystic fibrosis
(CF), one of the most common lethal autosomal recessive single gene disorders, due to recent large-scale
epidemiologic studies reporting significant excess of CF-like respiratory symptoms in CF carriers. The findings
are consistent with prior reports indicating that CF carriers have increased rates of sinus and lung disease,
even though other features of CF such as sweat chloride concentration are not abnormal. The medical
implications are substantial as there are an estimated 10 million CF carriers in the U.S. and an increasing
fraction are being identified during prenatal screening or by direct to consumer testing. As testing moves
toward sequencing of the CFTR gene, the detection of hypomorphic variants that reduce CFTR function but do
not cause CF creates uncertainty for the individual, family and medical team. Treatment of symptomatic CF
carriers with effective drugs that target CFTR, the protein defective in CF is conceivable. Although we know a
considerable amount about those affected with CF, the range of CFTR function in non-carrier individuals and in
CF carriers has yet to be determined. We propose to assess CFTR function in nasal epithelial cell cultures
derived from individual subjects. The nasal epithelium (NE) is a native location for CFTR expression and
conditionally reprogrammed cells derived from the NE form euploid monolayers that retain respiratory airway
cell characteristics. We will apply our experience in culturing nasal epithelial cells and assessing CFTR
function, insight into partial function variants and response to CFTR modulators in individuals with CF and
CFTR-related disorders to CF carriers and non-carriers.
The overall goal of this project is to determine if variation in CFTR function and/or presence of
hypomorphic CFTR variants correlates with CF-like symptoms in CF carriers and if CFTR modulators
might be effective treatment for symptomatic CF carriers. Four aims are proposed:
Aim 1. To determine if CFTR chloride transport function differs between healthy non-CF carriers and
asymptomatic CF carriers.
Aim 2. To determine if CFTR chloride transport function differs between symptomatic and asymptomatic CF
carriers.
Aim 3: To assess whether the frequency of hypomorphic CFTR variants differs between asymptomatic and
symptomatic CF carriers.
Aim 4. To determine CFTR function in CF carriers in response to a CFTR modulator.
Pursuit of these aims will address the molecular and medical implications of carrier status for CF that will
inform counseling and management of millions of CF carriers worldwide."

Early detection of cognitive and functional decline is a major goal of the NIA in its fight against Alzheimer's
Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Physical, physiological, and cognitive changes associated with ADRD
may emerge years prior to clinical manifestations, thus there is an urgent need for novel, cost-effective,
noninvasive, and scalable tools to improve detection of ADRD risk. Older adults with cognitive impairment often
exhibit changes in movement, sleep, and heart rhythms, suggesting possible shared vascular or
neurodegenerative pathways. Emerging research from our group and others links digital signals from movement,
sleep, and heart rhythms with brain and cognitive health; however, knowledge gaps remain in the associations
among these signals and brain and cognitive health across the cognitive spectrum. In response to NOT-AG-20-
017, this application will directly address these gaps using existing and ongoing/new data collection from
wearable technology (7-day accelerometry and 14-day ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG)), cognitive
assessments (neuropsychological battery, adjudicated cognitive diagnosis), and neuroimaging (florbetapir PET
for beta amyloid (Aβ), 3T brain MRI for neurodegeneration and white matter disease) from ≥1000 older adults
participating in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Neurocognitive Study. We will use novel analytic
approaches to integrate movement, sleep, and heart rhythm features and assess their individual and joint
associations with brain and cognitive health. Our overarching goal is to identify clinically relevant digital
biomarkers that combine movement, sleep, and heart rhythm signals as sensitive indicators of cognitive function,
cognitive trajectories, ADRD pathology, and cognitive diagnosis. To this end, this research will inform the future
use of wearable devices in large-scale studies, provide novel targets for screening and early detection of ADRD
in disease stages during which intervention and treatment are more likely to be effective, and aid in identifying
high-risk participants for prevention trials."
10880671,"Project Summary/Abstract
Some critical proteins, with functions both inside and outside of cells, circumvent conventional secretion via the
ER and Golgi and are released through Unconventional Protein Secretion (UPS) pathways. These routes are
evolved either to spatially and temporally control the function and the triggered release of these UPS cargoes by
certain stimuli, or to activate upon impairment of the conventional pathway. Hence, UPS pathways are often
triggered by cellular stress, e.g., in hypoxic metastatic tumors and cells under low energy conditions. Some UPS
cargos are assisted by chaperones, but many others are released independently. Their release involves self-
sustained direct crossing of a membrane, either the cell membrane (Type I UPS) or organelles (Type III UPS).
The fundamental question here is how UPS secreted proteins enter organelles and how their essential
translocation across membranes is regulated. Defining the molecular regulatory mechanisms is of high
significance to drive new therapeutic strategies (e.g., UPS modulators) for diseases associated with their
perturbed cellular distributions. We propose a novel hypothesis that explains the regulated and directed release
of these key proteins in tumor progression. Hypoxia instigates a transient or enduring cellular acidification. In
this model, the interplay between the local acidity and membrane curvature determines the conformational states
and membrane-binding mode of these cargoes. In the context of a Type III UPS, this promotes self-sustained
protein translocation across endosomal membranes and ultimate secretion. To test this hypothesis, we will
determine the extracellular release mechanism of two important UPS cargo proteins, the brain-type creatine
kinase and sphingosine kinase isoforms 1 and 2. Extracellular release of these proteins in various cancers
contributes substantially to the survival of metastatic cells. This mechanism is mediated by extracellular
production of their biologically active products. The subjects of this proposal as potential amphitropic proteins
are able to reversibly interact with a membrane. Thus, defining the conformational rearrangements triggering the
release of these proteins entails identifying the conformational states that are populated under low energy status
of the hypoxic metastatic cells. Testing the involvement of reversible structural refolding and incorporation into
the membrane is challenging due to their dynamic states and the difficulties of gaining high-resolution structural
information of membrane-bound protein states, particularly the effects of membrane curvature on the protein
structure. Thus, we have combined approaches encompassing a range of complementary and cutting-edge
methods as well as cell biology studies. Using a similar methodology to study the release mechanism of other
key therapeutic targets will test commonalities and differences in their extracellular release mechanism.
Ultimately, our research has the potential to define an unconventional protein secretion pathway employed by
cancer cells and other pathological conditions. In addition, as a long-term goal, we will bridge our basic research
studies that elucidate mechanism with translational research by testing our key conclusions in model organisms."

Cardiovascular disease remains the principal cause of death in the United States, with myocarditis contributing
to 42% of all sudden deaths in young adults. Human adenovirus type 5 is a leading etiological agent of viral
myocarditis, yet research is lacking due to host species specificity limiting the development of model systems
for cardiac infection. The effect of active adenoviral infection on cardiomyocyte function and arrhythmogenesis
that precedes immune responses and progression to heart failure is unknown. Gap junctions, predominantly
comprising the protein connexin43 (Cx43) in the ventricular intercalated disc, facilitate action potential
propagation during each heartbeat. An intimate association and interplay between gap junctions, other ID
resident ion channels, and components of mechanical junctions is now well accepted. Alterations in ID
mechanical and electrical coupling cause arrhythmias, and while it has been demonstrated that adenovirus
directly targets adhesion late in infection, the relationship between adenoviral myocarditis and Cx43 gap
junction, or other ion channel, function and regulation remains unexplored. Indeed, treatment for viral
myocarditis is largely supportive, with no therapeutic interventions or antivirals demonstrating significant clinical
efficacy to date. Through study of adenoviral infection of cardiac muscle at the molecular level, we will address
significant gaps in the knowledge regarding mechanisms underlying the impact of infection on cardiomyocyte
intercellular coupling and electrophysiology while identifying therapeutic targets to limit viral spread and/or
rescue electrical coupling in diseased hearts. Our long term goal is to elucidate the pathological mechanisms
of viral myocarditis and resulting arrhythmogenic subversion of cardiac ion channels and junctional structures.
The objective of this R01 proposal is to determine how electrical and mechanical intercellular coupling is
affected during acute adenoviral cardiac infection to precipitate an arrhythmogenic substrate. Our central
hypothesis is that adenovirus hijacks junction protein expression and function leading to an arrhythmogenic
substrate prior to gross pathological remodeling and the appreciable host immune responses. We will test this
hypothesis with the following two Specific Aims: Aim 1: Determine the role of early adenoviral proteins in
generation of an arrhythmogenic cellular landscape. The working hypothesis for this aim is that early
adenoviral proteins activate a PI3K/β-catenin signaling axis targeting Cx43 and cardiac ion channel function,
contributing to arrhythmogenesis. Aim 2: Determine the role of connexins and gap junction intercellular
communication in adenoviral pathogenesis. The working hypothesis for this aim is that adenovirus
stabilizes cellular junctions to facilitate viral spread while limiting intercellular communication to enhance viral
replication."

10899465,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
This renewal focuses on extending the novel findings developed in the current grant to delineate underlying circuit and
molecular mechanisms in noradrenergic (NA) respiratory function and to determine how NA dysfunction may play a role
in two life threatening pathophysiologies, Rett Syndrome and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Rett Syndrome is
the leading neuro-developmental disorder in females, presents with severe breathing perturbations, and is associated
with NA abnormalities. SIDS is the leading cause of neonate mortality in the United States, claiming 7-14 infants each
day and has been associated with NA abnormalities or other circuits that interact with the central NA system. To gain
additional insight into NA mechanisms in each of these pathophysiologies, we have developed several intersectional and
chemogenetic neural circuit mapping tools that have allowed us to subdivide the NA system into subpopulations defined
by their developmental origin for functional assessment in the adult mouse. With these circuit mapping tools and
technical enhancements from our laboratory in respiratory measurement techniques, we have found that NA neurons
derived from hindbrain rhombomeres 3 and 5 (transient genetically defined segments that embryonically pattern the
hindbrain and resulting brainstem; r3,5) give rise to NA sub-types that when chemogenetically silenced, reduce the
hypercapnic reflex and when chemogenetically stimulated, enhance the hypercapnic reflex. Leveraging these findings
and technical innovations, we have launched three novel areas of research in the NA system. 1) What are the
molecular mechanisms in NA system efferent signaling that are important in the hypercapnic reflex? A
significant number of r3,5 neurons co-express the neurotransmitter glutamate. Additionally, preliminary data indicates
that removing NA production from only r3,5 NA neurons does not affect the hypercapnic reflex, suggesting another
transmitter, such as co-expressed glutamate plays a role or can compensate. 2) What role do rhombomere 3,5 NA
neurons play in Rett disordered breathing. Our preliminary data suggests that chemogenetic stimulation of r3,5 NA
neurons in a mouse Rett model enhances an otherwise nearly absent hypercapnic reflex, indicating that these neurons
are still able to drive or modulate chemosensory function in a disease background. 3) What role does the NA system
play in the protective neonate auto-resuscitation reflex? Failure of the neonate auto-resuscitation reflex is thought to
be a common endpoint for many SIDS cases. We hypothesized that NA chemogenetic stimulation would enhance
neonate (P8) auto-resuscitation after a SIDS like challenge. However, we found that stimulation resulted in a near 50%
increase in mortality while NA system inhibition appears to enhance survival by 50%. In the proposed work, we seek to
determine the molecular and circuit organization of key NA subpopulations in breathing as well as two important
respiratory pathophysiologies, SIDS and Rett Syndrome. The outcomes of our work will yield important clues as to how
the developmental genetic organization of the central NA system underlies its functional and mechanistic integration into
the central respiratory network and how this system may be disrupted to play a role in the etiology of two prevalent
developmental respiratory disorders, Rett Syndrome and the fatal Sudden Infant Death Syndrome."

Filariases are a group of neglected tropical diseases produced by infection with microfilaria of Clade III
parasitic nematodes that are transmitted by biting insects. One example is the lymphatic filariasis
produced by Brugia malayi. Lymphatic filariasis is a debilitating and disfiguring disease which occurs in
120 million people worldwide. Other filarial diseases are River Blindness produced by Onchocerca
volvulus and loiasis produced by Loa loa. Prevention and treatment of these nematode parasite diseases
relies on the use of anthelmintic drugs because no effective vaccines are available. Prophylaxis using
Mass Drug Administration [MDA] programs are limited by the efficacy of existing anthelmintics.
Diethylcarbamazine is a mainstay for the treatment of lymphatic filariasis and loiasis in most parts of the
world, except in areas where onchocerciasis is present because it is contra-indicated by risks of blindness.
Diethylcarbamazine produces rapid clearance of microfilaria and causes ~40% mortality of adult parasites
(macrofilaricide). A number of studies have suggested that diethylcarbamazine has an indirect host-
mediated mode of action and that diethylcarbamazine acts by changing host arachidonic acid pathways.
We have observed that diethylcarbamazine has direct effects on filarial nematodes. We present
preliminary observations that show that diethylcarbamazine increases the opening of TRP-2 channels in
Brugia malayi, and opening of calcium-activated SLO-1 K channels. The effect is a rapid, transient
inhibition of motility followed by recovery: the response accommodates.
Emodepside is an emerging and important cyclooctadepsipeptide class of anthelmintic that also has
effects on microfilaria and adult filaria. Emodepside treatments could allow a major advance over existing
mass drug administration (MDA) programs which require regular treatments to kill adult parasites. One
of the sites of action of emodepside is on nematode SLO-1 K channels where opening of the channels
inhibits motility, but it is not effective against all filaria. Here we propose to compare effects on filarial SLO-
1 K channels from Brugia, Onchocerca and Loa and to examine actions and interactions of these two
drugs to explore their mode of action.
We have 3 aims:
Aim #1: Characterize, in vitro, the concentration motility-inhibition-response relationships of
diethylcarbamazine and emodepside and their combination on: A) Brugia microfilaria; B) Brugia
adult females; C) Brugia adult males.
We will test the hypothesis that effects of diethylcarbamazine
and emodepside are additive, synergistic or antagonistic and dependent of life-cycle stage and sex.
Aim #2 Characterize the SLO-1 K channel current responses to diethylcarbamazine and
emodepside in isolated Brugia malayi muscle flaps under patch-clamp
 We will test the hypotheses:
a) that the effects of emodepside and diethylcarbamazine interact; b) that the interactions of
diethylcarbamazine and emodepside are dependent on the presence of TRP-2 by knockdown of TRP-2
channels; and c) that TRP-2 and SLO-1 channel message & channel opening accommodates during
prolonged exposure to diethylcarbamazine or emodepside.
Aim #3: Characterize the comparative molecular pharmacology of: a) different SLO-1 K channels
of Brugia malayi, Onchocerca volvulus and Loa loa and; b) TRP-2 channels of Brugia malayi and
Loa loa expressed in oocytes.
We will test the hypothesis that the pharmacology and potencies of
emodepside and diethylcarbamazine on SLO-1 K channels and TRP-2 channels of, Brugia, Onchocerca
and Loa are different and also different to a human channel homologue. We will examine channel
desensitization.
The proposal is innovative, using a combination of techniques to test the effects of diethylcarbamazine
and emodepside on their putative target sites, SLO-1 K channels of filarial. The overall impact of using
our mixture of techniques, will be discovery and comparison of effects of diethylcarbamazine and
emodepside on different species of filarial TRP-2 channels and SLO-1 K channels. Knowledge of the
molecular actions of these drugs is required for: a) molecular detection of sensitivity of different filarial
species and resistance; b) designing new drugs and combination therapies; c) predicting and
understanding sensitivities of different nematode parasite species; and d) predicting possible host toxicity."

Widefield imaging and spatial multiplexing are crucial to advancing the field of
neuroscience. Current imagers do not offer the speed and versatility needed for
calcium or voltage imaging experiments. In the case of lifetime imaging the
functionality is completely lacking in CMOS imagers. The problem is more subtle
than it seems because it is not just a matter of brute force speed-up through
technology. Speed increases come with large amounts of power dissipation and
the need for faster data interfaces. One imaging technique with the potential to
solve this issue is the single photon avalanche detector (SPAD). SPADs by virtue
of operation result in digital pulse practically eliminating read noise that
commonly plagues regular imagers. However, SPAD imagers till date have not
seen widespread use due to low pixel density. One of the greatest advantages of
the SPAD imager is its ability to perform time correlated measurements, enabling
lifetime imaging. Lifetime imagers can yield absolute quantitative measurements
not possible with regular imaging modalities. However, the current SPAD
imagers take seconds to minutes to compute a lifetime image, much too slow for
neural imaging. We propose to overcome these fundamental barriers by
innovating at the device, architecture and packaging levels. Our proposed
approach utilizes a transistor amplified SPAD design coupled with in pixel analog
counting and lifetime estimation. These two innovations make it possible to read
the pixel level data at a slower rate, while maintaining a fast frame rate. We
additionally propose a new chip level integration approach which packages the
imager die and processing die in a silicon package enabling reading from
subarrays. This approach enables the imager to maintain the frame rate of the
pixel subarray as the pixel density scales. Finally, we demonstrate the
advantages of our imager by imaging dendritic activity, both in intensity and
lifetime imaging modes, in neural cultures at unprecedented spatiotemporal
scales."

The development of appropriate and effective community-based care for people living with severe mental illness
(SMIs) continues to be a global challenge, especially in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs). A particularly
damaging cycle emerges when people with SMIs are admitted to hospital for acute psychiatric treatment,
discharged back into community settings without appropriate support, only to be readmitted again due to
psychiatric relapse. This “revolving door” phenomenon is a multilevel challenge to mental health systems,
including in countries such as South Africa, with little to no formal community-based support systems for people
living with SMIs. However, promising evidence has been produced that Critical Time Intervention (CTI), a time-
limited psychosocial intervention with origins in the prevention of homelessness in the USA, could potentially
improve individual and system outcomes by providing support to vulnerable service users during the difficult
transition period from hospital to community settings. The proposed research project aims to build on a CTI
version that draws from community health workers and peer support workers, adapted for low-resource settings
in South America, to develop and pilot a locally appropriate intervention program for South Africa. Specifically,
we will draw from partner project data, supplemented by additional qualitative research and collated to provide
a contextual basis from which to adapt the CTI approach, its content and materials. In particular, we will seek
out specific community resources that could be included in the development of support networks, including
existing peer support groups, and, importantly, the involvement of traditional health practitioners. We will then
conduct a pilot feasibility cohort study in the uMgungundlovu District Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
We will recruit and train five teams that each include an auxiliary social worker and a peer support worker to
provide CTI support to 40 people with SMIs who are being discharged to community settings following acute
psychiatric hospitalization. Quantitative and qualitative process measures in terms of the Consolidated
Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), and outcome measures in terms of Reach, Effectiveness,
Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) will be gathered at several intervals throughout the CTI
piloting period. Our primary outcome will be the reduction in psychiatric readmission over a 16-month study
period, relative to the previous 16-month period. Along with several secondary outcomes, these measures will
provide the necessary data to establish feasibility, appropriateness, and limited effectiveness of the adapted CTI,
and lay a foundation for further trial research."

 This project evaluates the zoonotic implications of two important possible pathogens of companion
animals: E. coli and coronaviruses. E. coli is the most common pathogen tested for antibiotic susceptibility in
veterinary diagnostic labs. It is also one of the most concerning for multi-drug resistance; several isolates
captured thus far in Vet-LIRN active surveillance are predicted to be pan-resistant to all drugs used in human
or animal medicine. Our group has published the first animal host specific E. coli virulence database
compatible with tools that can mine whole genome sequencing data. We now propose a comparative
evolutionary genomic study to assess the potential of E. coli in dogs to encode novel resistance mechanisms
and cause disease in humans. The data will be explored employing the latest developments in bacterial pan-
genomic analysis, as well as bacterial GWAS. Such analysis will reveal if there are E. coli loci adapted to dogs,
whether such loci have the functional character suggestive of pathogenic potential, and whether dogs may be
a reservoir of potential pathogenesis or antibiotic resistance.
 The present outbreak of coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is the third
documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans to have resulted in a major epidemic, within the past
two decades. Characterizing the species diversity of coronaviruses from companion animals, represents an
important necessary step towards improving our understanding of virus–host interactions and to enhance our
preparedness for future outbreaks. We will undertake this characterization in three different host species –
horses, cats, and dogs – making use of an extensive set of time series samples (respiratory and feces) that
comprise the AHDC’s collection. Sequences of coronavirus genomes will be acquired using two approaches:
RNAseq of the respiratory virome and multiplexed amplicon approaches of both respiratory and feces samples;
the former will allow us to identify the coronavirus species repertoire of each host, including the identification of
any new coronavirus species, the latter will provide the ability to explore aspects of diversity in detail, within
and between hosts. Comparative evolutionary genomic analyses of the data will inform on a wide variety of
issues related to their zoonotic potential, including for example: (1) Which coronavirus species are more prone
to inter-host transmission and is there a directionality to that transmission? (2) Are their host reservoirs for any
of the virus species? (3) Which have a history of recombination? (4) Which have a history of molecular
adaptation and what viral proteins does that involve?
 Our final aim is to provide eight other Vet-LIRN sequencing laboratories with the reagents and training
to be able to independently sequence and analyze bacterial and viral genomes, including SARS-CoV-2. All

 Hearing and balance disorders disable nearly half a billion people worldwide, yet there are virtually no
pharmacological or biological therapies for these disorders. This alarming state of medicine coexist with the
brighter state of science where numerous therapeutic approaches have shown efficacy in animal models. This
conundrum reflects the fact that there are important differences between animal models and humans, that we
have an incomplete understanding of the molecular signatures of the auditory and vestibular organs in the human
inner ear, and that adult human inner ear tissues are not readily available to test promising therapeutics. We
propose to solve this conundrum by defining the molecular makeup of normal, live human inner ear
tissues (Aim 1), describing the three-dimensional (3D) cellular architecture of unprocessed human inner
ears (Aim 2), training new and established investigators (Aim 3), and enhancing awareness of human
inner ear research (Aim 4).
 In support of this approach, we have designed a surgical method to procure live inner ear tissues from
deceased organ donors who typically have normal auditory and vestibular function. We have begun assembling
a registry consisting of medical records, single-cell transcriptomes, and histologic sections of vestibular tissues
(utricles). In parallel, we have augmented the registry with utricles from vestibular schwannoma patients
undergoing surgical resection. Here, we propose to increase the recruitment of organ donors and vestibular
schwannoma patients and expand our registry to include all inner ear sensory organs and generate a molecular
cell atlas of the adult human inner ear (Aim 1). Additional tissues and perilymph will be collected, analyzed and
shared with the broader scientific community for gene and protein validation. Furthermore, we will use a
miniature, flexible imaging probe we developed to perform micro-optical coherence tomography (µOCT)-based
endomicroscopy on rapid autopsy cadavers to generate an optical cell atlas of the 3D-intact, unprocessed human

10899729,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Internalizing problems represent a growing public health concern, particularly across the transition to formal
schooling, when children face new academic, social, emotional, and behavioral challenges. Despite the
prevalence of internalizing problems during childhood, factors underlying their development are not well
understood relative to externalizing problems. Thus, the overall objective of the present study is to investigate
developmental pathways originating during pregnancy and unfolding across early childhood that contribute to
school-age internalizing problems by leveraging an ongoing, large-scale, multi-method, longitudinal study of
families. Based on prior theory and empirical evidence, it is expected that specific dimensions of parental
trauma-related distress (TRD) spanning pregnancy to preschool will be associated with internalizing problems
at age 5. Further, it is hypothesized that observed and self-reported emotion-related socialization behaviors
(ERSBs) during preschool-age will mediate the link between parental TRD and school-age internalizing
problems. Lastly, it is expected that nonsupportive reactions to children’s negative emotions, specifically, will
demonstrate unique incremental prediction of internalizing problems beyond other forms of ERSBs, such as
poor emotion coaching and supportive responses. Study aims will be pursued in an established community
sample of 159 families (mothers, fathers, and children) who have completed self-report measures during
pregnancy, at 1- and 6-months postpartum, and at child ages 1 and 2. Mothers, fathers, and children were
invited to attend a laboratory appointment when the child turned 3.5, where parental ERSBs were assessed via
self-report and observational coding paradigms. As part of the proposed project, mothers and fathers will be
invited to complete a survey of child internalizing problems from home when the child is 5 years of age.
Findings are expected to improve prevention and early intervention efforts for school-age children with
internalizing problems by identifying malleable factors within the early family environment (e.g., parental
psychopathology and parenting behaviors) that ultimately impact the development of internalizing problems.
The goals of this study will be accomplished within the proposed research training program, which is aimed at
helping the fellow develop expertise in family systems, observational coding, and statistical analyses involving
multi-method, longitudinal data. The training plan includes completion of relevant courses, attendance in
targeted workshops, individual supervision and mentorship by experts in the field, and preparation for an
academic career in clinical psychology."
10899748,"The prevailing approach to precision cancer medicine relies on genetic profiling of patients, followed by
identification of the malignant gene product, and delineation of the mechanisms of that protein product in causing
disease. As a result, much of the future of precision oncology is built on the hope of tailoring therapeutic
interventions based on diagnostic technologies that acquire complex genomic and transcriptomic data. Despite
the focus on cancer genetics, the unique functional capabilities acquired by normal cells during tumor
development are driven by the aberrantly activated tumor cell proteome that arises not only from gene mutations
but also from epigenetic reprogramming, post-translational alterations, or rewiring of signaling pathways.
Unfortunately, integrating traditional measurements of protein biochemistry that reflect tumor cell biology and the
therapeutics to which a tumor would respond into clinical decision-making for cancer patients is challenging due
to the uniqueness of each protein and limitations in existing technologies. Thus, our proposal focuses on
mechanism-based cancer research at the interface of chemistry and cancer biology to develop quantitative
approaches that evaluate dynamic changes in the proteome in order to characterize unique features of tumor
biology with the long-term goal of motivating novel targeted therapies. Specifically, we aim to establish an
innovative new development and discovery platform termed Probe Enabled Activity Reporting (PEAR) for tumor
proteome profiling by leveraging chemical biology approaches to understand the molecular complexity of
proteomic changes necessary for tumor cell function, as well as cellular adaptations to cancer therapy. The
foundation of our bedside-to-bench and back again approach is rooted in the hypothesis that novel chemical
probe reactomes exist in cancer cells themselves and changes in the reactome profile in response to cancer
therapeutics will reflect alterations in protein function that drive cancer cell adaptations and thus, would be ideal
for new treatment modalities in the future. In interconnected and interdisciplinary discovery and elucidation
modules, we will utilize state-of-the-art patient derived cancer models to both visualize and identify the protein
targets of chemical biology probes in pre- and post-treatment with the hypothesis that the differential reactomes
will be indicative of proteomic liabilities, therapeutic response, and unique aspects of tumor cell biology. The
major outcomes from investing in PEAR for tumor proteome profiling to enable therapeutic development will be
development of methodology to visualize reactive targets, identification of treatment induced reactive targets and
establishing their functional relevance, and unraveling unique tumor cell biology based on a novel
compartmentalized reactive target method. Taken together, our proposal will establish and validate novel
concepts and methodologies that can be applied across the broad spectrum of solid tumors and as an extension,
holds the potential to provide fundamental insights into tumor biology and transform precision oncology by
providing a platform to improve existing paradigms for drug discovery."
10883749,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pathophysiologic changes during critical illness can affect drug pharmacokinetics (PK, how the body
affects the drug) and pharmacodynamics (PD, how the drug affects the body), but the current paradigm of drug
dosing is a standard “one-size-fits-all” approach, rather than a personalized approach. Emerging data in adults
demonstrate increased risk of morbidity and mortality with standard doses of antibiotics in critically ill patients
due to lack of PD target attainment. β-lactam antibiotics are a prime example of drugs demonstrating high PK
and PD variability in critically ill patients. Thus, critically ill patients are at risk of having low antibiotic exposures
leading to ineffective bactericidal activity or high antibiotic exposures resulting in toxicity. By using real-time
drug concentrations, individual patient and disease factors, and population PK models, model-informed
precision dosing (MIPD) can ensure adequate antibiotic exposure while avoiding toxicity.
 My proposed research program will address three critical knowledge gaps that are necessary to fill prior to
implementation of antibiotic MIPD. First, the appropriate patient populations who will most benefit from
precision dosing remain unknown. Implementation of MIPD for every patient admitted to the intensive care unit
may be resource-intensive and costly. However, simply increasing antibiotic doses or frequency of
administration without data-driven management can be dangerous as it carries risks for antibiotic-associated
toxicity, including nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Therefore, it is critical to optimize the benefit-to-risk ratio of
therapeutic interventions for individual patients, a fundamental concept of precision medicine. Second, there
remains a knowledge gap on the association of precision dosing of antibiotics and clinical outcomes. Studies
examining antibiotic exposure and outcomes in adults have had mixed results; some show improved outcomes
with PD target attainment and some show no difference in outcomes with regards to target attainment. Third,
many of the antibiotic population PK models needed for MIPD have not been prospectively validated in
critically ill patients, so it is unknown which models should be used for precision dosing. To address these
knowledge gaps, Project 1 will utilize innovative modeling and simulation to identify patient and disease
factors associated with antibiotic under-exposure (risk of ineffective antibacterial activity) or over-exposure (risk
of toxicity) and investigate mechanisms underlying toxicities. Project 2 will investigate the effect of precision
dosing on clinical outcomes by evaluating the association between PD target attainment and clinical outcomes
at the individual level. Project 3 will prospectively validate our models and previously published models to
ensure accurate predictive ability in critically ill patients. With these prospectively validated models, we will lay
the foundation to build MIPD decision support tools integrated with the electronic health record to generate
individual patient PK and PD profiles for precision dosing in critically ill patients. These tools will be essential to
implement antibiotic MIPD to guide clinicians in dosing regimen selection for critically ill patients."

Structural Mechanism for Gating of Mechanosensitive Channels
Mechanical force sensation mediated by mechanosensitive channels underlies an array of fundamental
physiological processes, including hearing, touch, proprioception, osmoregulation, and morphogenesis.
Dysfunctional force sensation is associated with numerous diseases including deafness, atherosclerosis,
chronic pain and cancer. The prokaryotic mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS) protects
bacterial cells from rupture under hypoosmotic downshock. A variety of MscS-like channels, found in many
organisms including bacteria, fungi, algae, and plants, form an exceptionally diverse superfamily of channels
that are crucial for management of osmotic pressure. MscS homologs are absent in animals, and thus
targeting MscS channels in pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi could lead to new
antimicrobial treatment strategies. Current mechanistic understanding, primarily inferred from studies of the
prototypical prokaryotic channel, E. Coli MscS, remains limited. Structural, biochemical, and biophysical
analyses of complex membrane proteins such as eukaryotic MscS channels and multi-domain prokaryotic
MscS homologs have proven challenging owing to major difficulties in producing sufficiently large quantities of
biochemically stable protein samples. We have overcome these critical barriers through recent developments
in large-scale protein production and structural and functional analyses of a variety of MscS family members
with distinct membrane topologies and domain organizations. Our recent structural and functional studies of a
eukaryotic channel MSL1 have uncovered a `flattening and expansion' gating mechanism stemming from a
non-planar transmembrane domain at the resting state, which is reminiscent of the evolutionarily and
architecturally unrelated mammalian mechanosensitive Piezo channels. These results lead to our central
hypothesis that `flattening and expansion' in the transmembrane region may be a unifying gating mechanism.
With these exciting developments, we are now able to combine structural biology and electrophysiology to
address one of the central questions in mechanobiology: how do mechanosensitive channels gate?
Specifically, we aim to reveal gating transitions of a diverse set of MscS channels with distinct membrane
topologies to further evaluate this potentially universal gating mechanism. Detailed understanding of the
mechanisms will provide critical information that will ultimately lead to development of new antimicrobial
reagents and new treatment strategies for a broad spectrum of diseases associated with altered mechanical
force sensation."

We propose to continue development and support for the free and open source UltraScan-III (US3) software
suite and develop new code and methods to address challenging biomedical research questions that can be
solved with the latest instruments available for analytical ultracentrifugation and at beamlines for small-angle
X-ray and neutron scattering experiments (SAXS/SANS) experiments. UltraScan is a comprehensive toolkit for
the analysis of data from hydrodynamic experiments and simulations. Such experiments include analytical
ultracentrifugation and solution bio-SAXS/SANS, as well as bead modeling simulations. Support for this project
will assure continued availability of a mature multi-platform analysis suite with important and unique capabilities
not found in any other software packages. Chief among them are tight integration of supercomputing
capabilities, LIMS support for collaboration, and specialized analysis routines. US3 enjoys world-wide use in
the AUC and SAXS/SANS communities, and offers the most robust optimization and simulation algorithms
available, resulting in unmatched detail. UltraScan provides the highest throughput, a flexible, modern GUI,
and a comprehensive list of analysis routines. Proposed new developments include improved automation for
data acquisition, analysis, and reporting workflows, and new tools to support electronic signatures and audit

10883611,"Title: Human pregnane X receptor and sexual dimorphism in alcoholic liver disease.
Abstract: Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) develops from excessive alcohol use and is more severe in both human
and rodent females than their male counterparts. Female alcoholics also have higher death rate than men.
Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for more severe ALD in females, including sex differences
in ethanol (EtOH) pharmacokinetics, estrogen levels, and alcohol elimination rates. However, the precise
mechanism(s) is/are not well understood, although there are recent indications that suggest complexities in both
ALD sexual dimorphism and ALD pathogenesis. For example, the upregulation of murine hepatic fat-specific
protein 27 (Fsp27) and its human ortholog, cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor alpha-like effector c
(CIDEC), which have been previously implicated in metabolic disorders and cell apoptosis, promote a
progressive form of ALD, alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) in both mice and human patients with ASH. However,
whether EtOH hepatotoxicity in females involves Fsp27 upregulation is unknown. FSP27 is a target gene of the
lipogenic transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and inhibition of PPARγ
ameliorates ASH in mice. Upstream, PPARγ is transcriptionally regulated by pregnane X receptor (PXR), a
xenobiotic nuclear receptor that induces genes involved in the detoxification of drugs and other foreign
chemicals. We have previously shown that mouse PXR exacerbates EtOH-induced hepatotoxicity. Therefore,
we asked whether human PXR signaling similarly modulates the PPARγ-FSP27 signaling axis in EtOH
hepatotoxicity, particularly, focusing on sex differences in ALD. Unexpectedly, we found that chronic-plus-binge
EtOH ingestion upregulated both PPARγ and FSP27 in a sex-dependent manner in a PXR-humanized (hPXR)
mice, lacking the mouse Pxr gene, but carrying the full human PXR gene. Furthermore, the nuclear constitutive
androstane receptor (CAR) and PXR target gene, Cyp2b10, known to generate reactive oxygen species, was
also increased in the livers of EtOH-fed female hPXR mice. Thus, our central hypothesis is that the female
hPXR gene mediates sexual dimorphism in EtOH hepatotoxicity via increased lipogenesis and
synergistic generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by enhanced Fsp27 and Cyp2b10 gene
expression. To address these hypotheses, we will determine the contribution of the PXR-PPARγ-FSP27
signaling axis to female-specific ALD pathology (Aim 1). determine whether CYP2B6 induction is
involved in female-specific EtOH-induced hepatotoxicity (Aim 2). determine the contribution of PXR,
PPARγ, CYP2B6, and CIDEC genetic polymorphisms to sex and ethnic differences in ALD (Aim 3). A
strength of this proposal is that, it makes use of humanized mice and human tissues from both sexes, expediting
application to clinical studies. Based on our strong preliminary data, this proposal will provide valuable insights
into how sex and species-specific regulation of PXR target genes, as well as specific biomarkers from
metabolomics contribute to sex difference in EtOH-induced hepatotoxicity, which may identify therapeutic targets
for the treatment of ALD."
10883616,"Project Summary
Non-coding RNAs are key regulators of diverse biological processes in eukaryotes. MicroRNAs are a family of
small non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in a sequence-dependent manner.
Approximately 1,000 human microRNAs appear to control the expression of more than half of all human
messenger RNAs. Deviations from homeostatic microRNA expression levels, either reduced or enhanced
expression, have been linked to cancers, diabetes, heart and neurodegenerative diseases, among others. To
maintain proper microRNA expression levels, eukaryotic cells must tightly control the enzymatic processing of
primary and precursor microRNA elements. However, the molecular determinants underlying this strict regulation
of microRNA biogenesis are not fully understood. In this proposal we will explore both cis (RNA structure) and
trans (protein binding partners) regulators of microRNAs biogenesis. In Research Area 1, we will explore the
post-transcriptional regulation of members of the let-7 family of microRNAs. The processing of approximately
half of the let-7 microRNAs is mediated by a protein partner, Lin28. The other members of this family are
regulated by other, often unknown factors. We will determine the extent to which RNA modification, RNA
structure, and RNA dynamics can serve as regulatory triggers to control the processing of these other family
members. In Research Area 2, we will examine the differential processing of oncomiR-1, a polycistronic primary
microRNA that is enriched in many cancers. We will conduct in cell chemical probing studies, identify associated
cellular proteins, and elucidate a structural switch that controls processing of a subdomain. Our long-term goal
is to determine the tertiary structure of oncomiR-1 alone and in complex with regulatory proteins. Collectively,
these studies will help elucidate the molecular determinants underlying the highly-regulated production of
microRNAs. RNA structures remain underdetermined relative to proteins, leading to an asymmetry in our
mechanistic understanding of RNA folding and function. We expect that the methodology and approach
developed in these studies will be broadly applicable to studies of other regulatory RNAs and protein-RNA
complexes. This enhanced structural insight will inform on how RNA structure can directly regulate biological
activity and will pave the way for the development of novel RNA-targeted therapeutics."
10879317,"The goal of the proposed research is to discover new mechanisms underlying the development
of hyperactive neuronal networks in the brain. Hyperactivity of neuronal networks due to the loss
or impaired function of inhibitory neurons can lead to neural dysfunctions and seizures. Both
impaired inhibition and glial dysfunctions have been linked to several neurodevelopmental
disorders including autism. Autism is an increasingly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder
that affects approximately 1 in 59 children in the United States. We hypothesize that ephrin-
B/EphB receptor signaling controls the development of inhibitory networks by regulating the
interactions between pyramidal neurons and parvalbumin-expressing (PV) cells that are critical
for normal development. Premise of the study is supported by our new and unexpected
discovery that implicated astrocytic ephrin-B1 and Ephrin-B/EphB receptor signaling in the
development of connections between inhibitory PV cells and excitatory pyramidal cells in the
hippocampus. Our preliminary findings also show that loss of astrocytic ephrin-B1 increases
susceptibility to seizures and reduces sociability in mice. As genetic studies have linked de novo
variants in gene encoding EphB2 receptor with autism spectrum disorders (EPHB2 gene is
identified as a strong candidate with score 2 in SAFARI database), this study may also
contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of these brain disorders.
We will test our hypothesis in three specific aims: Aim 1 will determine if EphB receptors
expressed in PV and SOM cells negatively regulate inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons by
examining the effects of PV- and SOM-specific ablation of EphB2 and EphB1 on the inhibitory
synapse development in the hippocampus during critical developmental period using
biochemical, immunohistochemical and optogenetic approaches. Aim 2 will determine the
mechanism of EphB signaling in regulating inhibitory synapse formation by establishing the role
of the neuronal ephrin-B/EphB signaling in inhibitory synapse formation. Aim 3 will test if
astrocytic ephrin-B1 positively regulates inhibitory synapse formation on pyramidal cells through
the displacement of EphB receptors from PV boutons. The proposed study will further our
understanding of the mechanisms which lead to neurodevelopmental disorders and will allow us
to discover novel interventions for treating these disorders through targeting EphB receptor
signaling and astrocytes during specific developmental period."

 This project aims to improve needle placement accuracy for image-guided prostate interventions,
including biopsy and focal treatment. Building upon the success of the previous cycle, the project seeks to
enhance the robustness and effectiveness of the technology in complex anatomical structures, thereby aiding
clinical translation for prostate cancer care and broader applications. Percutaneous needle placement is a critical
procedure in both the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Although these procedures are often assisted
by an external needle-guiding device for accuracy, the unpredictability of needle deflection due to interactions
with varying tissue densities frequently necessitates multiple placement attempts. This prolongs the procedure
time and can lead to excessive tissue damage. The project’s previous cycle aimed to tackle this problem by
developing two technologies: a fiber-Bragg-grating (FBG)-based shape-sensing needle (sensorized needle) for
real-time feedback and a data-driven needle steering algorithm (COADAP) for active compensation of needle
deflection. Together, these technologies created a closed-loop adaptive needle placement system, enhancing
needle placement accuracy. However, the team identified these technologies’ limitations when the needle
encountered complex, interconnected multistructural anatomy. In such situations, the needle’s interactions with
different structures led to significant deflection, limiting the technology’s application in clinical settings. Therefore,
this phase aims to address this challenge by extending the capabilities of the sensorized needle and COADAP
algorithm. The research plan comprises three specific aims: (Aim 1) Develop a multi-core FBG sensorized needle
for robust distributed shape sensing: We will enhance the design of sensorized needles using multi-core fiber
(MCF) sensors for robust and distributed needle shape sensing. We will develop a machine-learning model to
predict the needle trajectory using real-time shape information. (Aim 2) Extend the COADAP algorithm for
interconnected multistructural anatomy: The objective is to compensate for needle deflection in interconnected
multistructural anatomy. This involves the development of an extended COADAP algorithm, called Shape-
Control COADAP (SC-COADAP), to account for the full needle shape in model predictive control. (Aim 3)
Validate the sensorized needle with COADAP in interconnected multistructural anatomy: We will test the
hypothesis that adaptive needle placement with the MCF sensorized needle and SC-COADAP meets the
required accuracy. This will be done via ex vivo and in vivo validation, using a multistructural anatomy-mimicking
phantom and swine models, respectively."
10880067,"Project Summary / Abstract
 HER2-positive breast cancers are highly aggressive and associated with poor prognosis. HER2-targeted
therapy is the preferred treatment for these cancers, but drug resistance is a major problem. Our previous studies
demonstrated that dysregulation of G protein coupled receptors, in particular, a subgroup of GPCRs that couple
to G protein αi/o subunits (Gi/o-GPCRs), contributes to HER2-induced breast cancer initiation and progression.
Targeting Gi/o-GPCR signaling blocks tumor progression and enhances the efficacy of HER2-targeted therapy.
 This proposal aims to delineate how dysregulated Gi/o-GPCR signaling may control HER2+ breast cancer
progression through a poorly studied CTLH E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The CTLH (carboxy-terminal to LisH
domain) complex is a mammalian ortholog of the yeast GID (glucose-induced-degradation-deficient) complex
that contains multiple subunits, including an adaptor/scaffold protein, WDR26, which may be required for CTLH
complex assembly and recruitment of specific substrates for ubiquitination and degradation. The CTLH complex
was implicated in tumorigenesis but its exact functions in tumor development remain largely unknown.
 We previously found WDR26 is a scaffolding protein that regulates GPCR signaling and is highly upregulated
in all molecular subtypes of invasive breast carcinoma and associated with worse prognosis. In preliminary
studies, we tested WDR26 gene deletion in a Neu transgenic mouse model of HER2+ breast cancer and showed
mammary-specific WDR26 gene deletion recapitulated a Gi/o-GPCR-signaling blockade: both inhibited tumor
initiation, growth, and lung metastasis. WDR26 likely promotes both G protein signaling and controls CTLH-
ubiquitin-ligase-driven degradation of SNF5 (an epigenetic tumor suppressor) in tumor cells. Based on these
exciting preliminary data, we hypothesize that, in HER2-driven breast tumors, WDR26 upregulation promotes
G-protein signaling and facilitates nuclear CTLH-complex assembly and E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, leading to
ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of SNF5; and this SNF5 depletion activates oncogenic transcriptional
programs, in part, by upregulating EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homology 2), ultimately promoting tumor growth and
metastasis and resistance to HER2-targeted therapy. In this study, using a combination of cell lines, several
newly developed genetic and patient-derived xenograft mouse models, we will determine 1) how WDR26
manifests dysregulated Gi/o-GPCR signaling to drive breast cancer progression via the CTLH complex; 2) how
the CTLH complex regulates breast cancer development by targeting SNF5 for proteasomal degradation; and
3) whether targeting the CTLH and SNF5 function improves the efficacy of HER2-targeted therapy.
 The results of our studies should fundamentally advance understanding of how the poorly studied CTLH E3
ubiquitin ligase complex targets the epigenetic tumor suppressor SNF5 to drive tumor progression and drug
resistance. This knowledge should help us identify new strategies for augmenting HER2-targeted therapy in
breast cancer."
10901984,"Project Summary/Abstract: The proposed project uses a two Aim strategy to investigate the regulation of
cardiac calcium transport. The goals of the planned experiments are to uncover novel mechanisms of calcium
handling and determine how these mechanisms are disrupted in disease.
Aim 1 is focused on how the affinity of phospholamban (PLB) for its regulatory target, SERCA2a, changes
during exercise. Aim 1a experiments will reveal the structural determinants of the functional differences
between inhibitory and non-inhibitory regulators of SERCA. We will explore how PLB stabilizes specific
enzymatic intermediate states in the SERCA catalytic cycle, leading to transport inhibition. Aim 1b addresses
the dynamics of regulatory interactions in health and disease. The experiments will test how competing
interactions limit the rate of recovery of inhibition of SERCA after a prolonged period of calcium elevation. Aim
1 will reveal how SERCA and PLB molecular interactions change as the heart is stimulated from a resting heart
rate to an elevated heart rate during exercise, followed by post-exercise recovery.
Aim 2 will investigate alternative modes of binding for the PLB-SERCA regulatory complex. Our previous
computational study identified multiple non-canonical binding sites on SERCA where PLB can interact in
several alternative orientations. Thus, the PLB-SERCA interaction represents a “fuzzy complex”. The structural
hypotheses generated from that previous study will be tested directly in Aim 2a of the proposed project using
photoactivatable cross-linking and mass spectroscopy experiments. We will determine the functional role of the
alternative interactions using live cell Ca uptake measurements and in vitro assays of SERCA ATPase
function. In Aim 2b we will explore the pathophysiology of the SERCA fuzzy complex. Heart disease produces
peptide fragments of membrane proteins that may interact with and disrupt SERCA activity or regulation. We
will identify candidate “poison peptides” by mass spectrometry and test their ability to bind SERCA, inhibit Ca
transport, or displace native regulatory partners. The experiments will provide new insight into a novel
pathophysiological mechanism in heart failure and ischemic heart disease.
Seth Robia (PI) and collaborating investigators bring complementary expertise and methods. Howard Young,
University of Alberta, will provide expertise in cryo-EM and SERCA structure/function. Aleksey Zima is an
expert in cardiac calcium handling and will assist with quantitative physiological experiments. Drs. Young and
Zima participated in the previous, highly productive funding cycle for this project. Jonathan Kirk will bring mass
spectrometry and proteomics expertise. Peter Kekenes-Huskey will contribute physiological models of the
SERCA transport cycle and the regulatory interactions that govern transport function. Preliminary collaborative
experiments suggest a high likelihood of future success for this research team. We are in a unique position to
make scientifically significant advances in our understanding of the regulation of cardiac calcium transport."

The goal of this proposal is to optimize a new lead series for treatment of relapsing malaria
caused by Plasmodium vivax. When an infectived mosquito bits she inoculates sporozoites that
invade hepatocytes. Within the hepatocyte the forms can either develop and reproduce or
become dormant. These dormant hypnozoites are the forms that persist for weeks to years and
can reactivate to cause disease. There are no good drugs for treating hypnozoites that are safe,
especially for glucose-6phosphate dehtdriogenase deficient people. In this project wi wil use a
novel liver stage culture system to drive the medicinal chemistry optimization of the new lead
series of drugs with anti-hypnozoite activity. Secondly we aim to use the lead and back up
series to develop chemical probes to identify the targets for hypnozoite killing. Cyrrently there
are no validated targets for drug discovery against hypnozoites. Finally we aim to use a
combination of chemical biology, advanced culture techniques, and new metabolic labelling
approaches to validate the new leads and gthe liver stage culture model."

My laboratory studies the molecular alterations that contribute to metastasis formation, a poorly understood
process and primary cause of solid cancer deaths. It has long been thought that metastasis is caused by
somatic metastasis driver mutations—postulated alterations that have yet to be identified. By showing that
levels of specific microRNAs become altered in metastatic tumors and identifying their target genes, my lab
identified and characterized critical pathways and processes underlying metastasis formation. By studying
germline variants of one such target metastasis gene, we discovered that metastatic potential can also pre-
date tumor formation and be genetically inherited—revealing an unanticipated genetic underpinning for
metastasis and opening up a new direction for the field. Specifically, we determined that two common human
germline variants of the secreted glycoprotein ApoE promote or suppress metastasis in melanoma, with recent
data suggesting this principle may apply to additional cancers. ApoE signaling was found to govern vascular
and immune interactions as well as cellular invasiveness that collectively contribute to metastasis formation.
These insights have significant translational potential and formed the basis of clinical trials that are providing
proof-of-concept for ‘metastasis targeting therapy’, where multiple metastasis regression responses were
observed in advanced stage patients for whom standard of care and immunotherapy treatments had failed.
Going forward, we will use allelic variants of ApoE as powerful genetic entry points to understand the
molecular events underlying metastasis formation, where we will define how ApoE signals are received by
cells and how ApoE mediates intracellular events. We will also extend the concept of hereditary metastasis
genetics to additional cancers and genes, applying our reverse genetic and mouse modeling approaches to
breast and colorectal cancer metastasis. To achieve this understanding, we will employ innovative optical,
physiological, genetic modeling and screening methods to interrogate mouse and human metastatic
transitions. This award will enable our group to establish the first genetically guided framework for
understanding the molecular mechanisms governing metastasis formation—enabling new avenues for its
therapeutic treatment and prevention."

The inability of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to target and kill tumor cells is a major hurdle in treating
many malignancies. New treatment strategies that block immune inhibitory mechanisms, such as antibodies
that block the interaction of programmed death-1 (PD-1) with its ligand, B7 homolog 1 (B7-H1, also known as
PD-L1), have shown promising efficacy in the clinic. Termed checkpoint inhibitor therapy, these drugs have
been approved for many indications, including melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and lung cancer, and are
increasingly being used in combination or in conjunction with other cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy
and radiation. Although checkpoint inhibitor treatments have resulted in durable clinical responses in a large
proportion of cases, many patients present with tumor types that do not respond to treatment. For instance,
~26% of NSCLC cases, which are negative for B7-H1/PD-L1 and positive for TILs, have been shown to be
resistant to anti-PD-1/B7-H1(PD-L1) (anti-PD) therapy. This type of NSCLC, denoted as Type III, is suspected
to harbor a mechanism of immune inhibition distinct from other NSCLC types, which has been found to be
driven, at least in part, by sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 15 (siglec-15). Siglec-15 expression is
mutually exclusive from B7-H1/PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cohorts and has been shown to inhibit T cell
proliferation and effector function. Blocking of siglec-15 using anti-siglec-15 (S15) monoclonal antibody (mAb)
is therapeutic in mouse models and human cell culture systems and results in amplified T cell responses.
Based on these findings, a phase I/II, dose escalation, safety and tolerability clinical trial for S15 mAb
treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors is on-going. Although preliminary studies have
generated promising results with regard to the potential efficacy of S15 mAb in the clinic, the mechanism of
S15-mediated immune suppression remains unknown. Furthermore, to enhance and improve treatment
response rates, more work must be done to identify pertinent biomarkers for S15 mAb therapy and modes that
modulate S15 expression. Finally, developing combination strategies that alter the tumor microenvironment
(TME), such that conversion of the tumor Type is achieved, is imperative for successful targeting and killing of
tumor by immune cells and in attaining increased patient response rates to available checkpoint inhibitor
therapies. A newly generated immune PDX (iPDX) mouse model, which uses patient-derived tumor tissue to
recapitulate and manipulate immune cell responses in the TME, will be utilized to investigate these topics
specifically in the NSCLC setting. A proposed investigator-initiated phase II clinical trial in patients with S15+
advanced NSCLC who have progressed on PD-1 axis inhibitor therapy will evaluate S15 mAb efficacy and
support biomarker validation studies. Strategies to combine S15 mAb with other agents, such as anti-FGL1
and anti-4-1BB/CD137, to improve therapeutic effect will also be explored. Taken together, the studies
proposed here will improve our understanding of the NSCLC TME and enhance therapeutic approaches."
10900799,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Targeted therapies have completely transformed the landscape for diagnosis and treatment of metastatic lung
cancer. Despite this success, targeted therapies are not curative and acquired resistance is a major
impediment to cures or durable responses for patients treated with these therapies. A paradigm for the
success of targeted therapies in lung cancer, comes from Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutant
lung cancer. Mutations in exons encoding the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR are found in approximately 10-
15% of lung adenocarcinomas in the US. These mutations confer sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
and four TKIs (erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib and, most recently, osimertinib) are currently approved for the first-line
treatment of EGFR mutant lung cancer. Acquired drug resistance, however, is a major challenge with all of these
TKIs including osimertinib, but we have very limited knowledge of the mechanisms of resistance to
osimertinib given its recent adoption in the clinic. Without knowledge about resistance mechanisms, optimal
post-osimertinib treatment strategies remain to be defined. Data from our labs and others indicate that
osimertinib resistance can arise through both EGFR-dependent mechanisms involving several different types of
EGFR mutation and EGFR-independent mechanisms – frequently epigenetic in origin – that are poorly
understood. Very little is known about the molecular context(s) in which these resistance mechanisms
emerge, their frequency, biochemistry and how to target them pharmacologically. Given the speed of
adoption of osimertinib as 1st line therapy, there is an urgent need to identify these mechanisms and resulting
vulnerabilities. We propose to leverage our collective expertise in lung cancer biology, mouse models,
resistance to targeted therapies and EGFR structural biology to address these issues. Using unique in vitro and
in vivo models and patient resources of acquired resistance to osimertinib, innovative genomic and biochemical
tools we will: 1) Identify molecular features and new therapeutic vulnerabilities of osimertinib-resistance EGFR
variants. 2) Establish mutant EGFR heterodimerization patterns and determine whether these can be leveraged
therapeutically to overcome osimertinib resistance; 3) Identify epigenetic processes that confer TKI resistance.
Our studies will yield a comprehensive understanding of osimertinib resistance and insight with which to develop
new mechanism-based approaches to target osimertinib-resistant tumors – an urgent unmet clinical need."
10900800,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Lung cancers are the major source of metastasis in the central nervous system (CNS). There is an important
gap in our understanding of how brain metastases respond to therapies and what mechanisms sustain metastatic
tumors in the CNS. Historically, the blood brain barrier has been viewed as an impediment to systemic drugs,
and novel brain penetrant agents such as the mutant EGFR inhibitor osimertinib have been developed. However,
despite improved clinical responses with these agents, brain metastases still progress, and it is unknown how
perturbations in the brain tumor microenvironment (TME) can be leveraged for more effective treatments in
patients with CNS disease. We have developed novel methods to molecularly characterize human cerebral
spinal fluid (CSF) as well as distinguish tumor from stromal gene alterations of brain metastasis in vivo. Our
approaches uncover genetic mutations as well as brain TME induced alterations that converge onto cooperating
pathways, such as those regulated by VEGF, NOTCH, β-catenin and PI3K. We hypothesize that these
molecular alterations: 1) cooperatively drive NSCLC brain metastasis and drug resistance in the brain, 2) are
clinically actionable, and 3) are more accurately detected in human CSF or brain biopsies, due to divergent
genetic evolution and TME induced adaptation of brain metastasis.
 Our hypothesis will be studied in 3 independent yet complimentary aims. In Aim1, we propose to collect
human CSF from craniotomies as well as lumbar punctures of lung cancer patients with brain metastases who
will be undergoing a bronchoscopic biopsy. By comparing the mutational landscape of matched CSF, plasma
and tumor tissue, we will molecularly characterize humans with asymptomatic brain metastasis. Moreover, we
will use novel orthotopic patient derived xenograft models (PDXs) to determine if brain metastasis progression
and drug response correlates with co-occurring mutations identified in human CSF. In Aim 2, we will test the
novel hypothesis that an activated brain microvasculature enhances the survival of drug resistant tumor cells via
stromal induced NOTCH signaling in vivo. We will assess if novel bi-specific agents which simultaneously inhibit
VEGF and NOTCH can delay brain metastasis progression and/or improve osimertinib response in pre-clinical
models. Using human biospecimens, we will correlate the expression of VEGF and NOTCH pathway
components with brain metastatic relapse. In Aim 3, we will conduct a clinical trial combining a mutation specific
TKI (osimertinib) with a brain vascular targeting agent (bevacizumab) in treatment naïve lung cancer patients
with EGFR mutant tumors and CNS disease. Finally, molecular markers (including those studied in Aims 1 and
2) of response or resistance to this combination will be identified by analyzing CSF, plasma and tumor biopsies.
 This proposal will help uncover the biological basis of brain metastasis relapse. Importantly, our study will
generate insight as to how current and prospective therapies can be harnessed to target both tumor specific
mutations and the TME, in a manner that improves clinical outcomes for lung cancer patients with CNS disease."

With the aging of the American population, the number of older adults at risk for developing cognitive impairment
is staggering. Recent research points to age-related change in cognitive performance beginning as early as age
30, highlighting the potential for early interventions. Cognitive function has long been assessed using
standardized cognitive tasks administered via neuropsychological evaluation. However, the traditional way to
assess cognitive ability is time consuming, requires trained personnel, requires an office visit, and identifying
decline among younger adults is particularly challenging because it can be masked by item redundancy effects.
Here we propose developing a new computerized adaptive test (CAT) to assess cognitive function, either in
clinic or remotely, that is based on recent advances in multidimensional item response theory (MIRT). We are
calling it the CAT-COG. The CAT-COG will assess global cognitive ability as a primary domain as well as 5
cognitive subdomains: episodic memory, language/semantic memory, processing speed, attentional
control/working memory, flexible cognition/reasoning. Our approach will revolutionize computer-based cognitive
testing (ultimately in a platform independent way), providing precise estimation of an individual’s ability on these
domains with minimal respondent burden, using a sufficiently large bank of items so that the same individual’s
cognitive ability can be assessed repeatedly without reusing items or stimuli. This project brings together an
accomplished interdisciplinary team of researchers and also builds on the unique resources of the Rush
Alzheimer’s Disease Center (RADC). These are the key project steps: (1) We will develop a new 500 item bank
of cognitive tasks and test them alongside a standard battery of neuropsychological tests through the RADC,
and in an online Prolific sample that includes younger adults. (2) Based on these data, we will develop a
computerized adaptive test (CAT- COG) appropriate for measuring global cognitive function and cognitive
subdomains across the life course. (3) We will test and validate the CAT-COG among returning RADC
participants who will also receive traditional neuropsychological testing. (4) We will study short-term variability of
the CAT-COG based on daily assessment for a week to determine learning effects and develop a testing
protocol that is immune to such effects. (5) we will harmonize the CAT-COG with the RADC standard battery of
neuropsychological tests so that existing data can be linked to newly collected CAT-COG assessments."

In today’s efforts to personalize medicine, it does not seem reasonable to personalize medicine
without constructing and utilizing an individual’s genome structure for both haplotypes. Current
standards force the reference genome’s structure on each individual. The same principle applies
to understanding the function for individual RNA isoforms. Structural variants are involved in, or
directly cause, a broad range of diseases including cancer, autism, schizophrenia,
neurodegenerative diseases, and Crohn’s disease, among others. We seek to better understand
how structural variants affect disease by helping characterize structural variants and their
downstream effects, combining this information with RNA isoform sequencing (IsoSeq). The
histocompatibility complex, which contains the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, is a
particular region of interest for my lab because this region has been implicated in dozens of
diseases. Similarly, we seek understand the role for individual RNA isoforms for all genes.
Protein-coding human genes average seven RNA isoforms, resulting in unique protein products.
For practical reasons, standard short-read RNA sequencing studies treat all isoforms as a single
‘gene’—an oversimplification of the underlying biology; this is also true when considering sex
differences in human health and disease. While females and males have many similarities, both
sexes have unique biology with clear differences in disease prevalence, therapeutic needs, and
responses. Females, in particular, have not received adequate attention in human health and
disease research. A next critical step in all of biology research, especially in disease research,
will be to determine individual isoform function, and how that changes between sexes. We want
to contribute to this effort, and propose to employ long-read sequencing technologies to
accomplish these goals."

 Current therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) do not reverse, or even slow, progression of the disease.
This situation is dire and exacerbated by the failure of antibodies directed toward two of the more promising
targets—phosphorylated tau and beta-amyloids—to treat the disease. Clearly, new treatments are urgently
needed.
 In 2017, a large genome-wide study associated a naturally-occurring variant (P522R) of PLCG2, the gene
encoding PLC-2, with protection from late onset AD. In follow-up studies, this genetic association has remained
strong and highly reproducible. Even more encouraging, in clinical studies of patients with mild cognitive
impairment, people that carried PLCG2 (P522R) had slower rates of cognitive decline compared to non-carriers.
Protection was observed even for patients homozygous for ApoE4, a biomarker strongly linked to AD. In the
brain, PLC-2 is primarily expressed in microglial cells where it controls phagocytic and neuroinflammatory
processes. It is more highly expressed in pathological areas of patients with AD. In microglia, PLC-2 is activated
downstream of both TREM2 (which uses ApoE4 as a ligand) and CSF1R, two transmembrane receptors that
are strongly linked to AD. Similarly, PLC-2 activates PKC, which is also linked to AD. Thus, genetic and cellular
data strongly support PLC-2 as a novel therapeutic target for treatment of AD.
 The phospholipase activity of PLC-2 (P522R) is modestly elevated relative to its wild-type counterpart and
it is this increased activity in microglia that is generally accepted to protect against AD. We propose to identify
and optimize small molecules that selectively activate PLC-2 to reproduce the neuroprotective effects of PLC-
2 (P522R) and treat AD. The research plan relies on complementary high-throughput assays enabled by two
fluorogenic substrates for eukaryotic PLCs that we invented explicitly for this research. Consequently, we will
pursue three Aims. In Aim 1, in-house collections totaling ~300,000 compounds will be screened for activators
of PLC-2 and primary hits verified for activity, selectivity, composition, and purity; cheminformatics will be used
to structurally classify hits. In Aim 2, a high-quality model of full-length PLC-2 coupled with molecular dynamics
simulations will be used for computational screens of tens of millions of compounds. In Aim 3, a suite of
biochemical, biophysical, and cell biological studies will be used to prioritize allosteric activators of PLC-2 with
favorable chemical and pharmacological properties. These novel small molecules will be invaluable tools to
further understand how PLC-2 (P522R) reduces the risk of AD. The small molecules will also be used as leads
for the development of novel therapeutics to treat AD."

This collaborative project between Brown University and Beijing Normal University responds to RFA-MH-23-260
by developing and testing a multi-level intervention program (“Together We Can”) to engage adolescents (age
12-19), school teachers, and caregivers in suicide prevention in rural China. Suicide has become the top 1
leading cause of death among adolescents in China. In particular, adolescents in rural China – a population
exposed to chronic poverty and resource deprivation – are at high risk of suicide. There is a lack of mental health
literacy while stigma against suicide and seeking professional psychological help runs deep in rural China. No
training exists for teachers and caregivers to recognize signs of suicide risk, normalize conversations related to
mental health, and refer at-risk adolescents to resources. Further, the current psychological education in China
lacks teaching applicable coping and help-seeking skills and stigma reduction on mental health and suicide.
There is an urgent need to address this public health crisis in school settings and develop interventions that
engage adolescents, teachers, and caregivers in the rural, low-resource context. Our research team has taken
the first step to collectively developed and test a teacher-focused gatekeeper program (“Life Gatekeeper”) for
teachers in rural China, with promising findings from a recent RCT with teachers. Building on our prior work and
leveraging our existing relationships with schools in rural Guangdong, we aim to build the next building blocks of
a universal intervention (“Together We Can”) by engaging adolescents (via socioemotional learning), teachers
(via the existing “Life Gatekeeper” program) and caregivers (via adapting the “Life Gatekeepers” for caregivers).
We will also incorporate technology-mediated support via existing mobile platforms to maximize scalability. By
developing a low-cost, multi-level suicide prevention program and establishing a protocol with community-
centered and implementation perspectives, the “Together We Can” program has the potential to achieve
scalability and sustainability, if proven to be efficacious. The aims of this early phase, clinical project include (1)
to conduct focus groups with caregivers, school teachers, and individual interviews with adolescents on needs
related to suicide prevention on various levels, preferred intervention content, and implementation strategies for
successful delivery, (2) to prepare the RCT phase by creating the multi-level “Together We Can” program,
forming an implementation resource team, and conducting workshops and staff training, and (3) to evaluate the
feasibility, acceptability, safety, and preliminary effects of the Together We Can program via a randomized
controlled trial (RCT) with two schools in rural China (intervention vs. usual care). We will conduct assessment
at baseline, 4-months, and 8-months follow-ups. We will also collect data on barriers and facilitators to
implementation of the “Together We Can” program through surveys and exit-interviews. This developmental
grant will provide essential data to guide subsequent application for a fully powered RCT with multiple schools
in rural area and invest in capacity development for researchers and local professionals in China."
10872735,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death, but there is no effective treatment for the
late-stage cancer. Early detection with colonoscopy appeared to lower CRC risk but not associated death. To
reduce cancer mortality, it is important to develop effective agents for inhibiting high-risk CRC in people with
cancer driver mutations and adenomas. Although inhibition of cyclooxygenases (COX-1/-2) by NSAIDs including
aspirin have been recognized for preventing CRC, long-term use of NSAIDs is limited due to side effects and
moderate anticancer efficacy. It is therefore necessary to search for alternative and improved preventive
strategies and agents. Research has shown that pro-inflammatory 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) promotes colon
cancer development and may be a target for inhibiting CRC. Further, nuclear factor (NF)-κB and JAK-STAT3
are known to contribute to inflammation and promotion of CRC. Importantly, we and others have shown that γ-
and δ-tocotrienol (γTE, δTE), which are members in the vitamin E family, inhibit 5-LOX activity, NF-κB and STAT3
activation and the growth of cancer cells. δTE-13’-COOH, a metabolite of δTE, has been shown to be a unique
inhibitor of COXs and 5-LOX. In agreement with these findings, a δTE/γTE (8/1) mixture and δTE-13’-COOH
have been reported to inhibit chemically-induced colon cancer in mice. Based on these observations, we
hypothesize that δTE/γTE and δTE-13’-COOH are novel and effective preventive agents against CRC. Despite
existing evidence supporting our hypothesis, there are key knowledge gaps hindering translation of the use of
these promising agents to the clinic. In particular, the anticancer effects of these compounds have not been
examined in a “human-like” CRC model. The objective of this application is to delineate the anticancer effects
and mechanisms of δTE/γTE and δTE-13’-COOH in an innovative CRC model (AKC), which like CRC patients,
has mutant Apc and Kras and spontaneously develop adenoma tumors in the large intestine. Significance: The
success of this study will develop new cancer-preventive agents, generate preliminary data for R01 application
to further validate these compounds for CRC prevention, and offer key preclinical data for translation of basic
research to the clinic."

Influenza virus is a significant pathogen in adult solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. However, these
individuals respond poorly to standard-dose (SD) inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). Recent studies have
investigated two strategies to overcome poor immune responses in SOT recipients: (1) administration of high-
dose (HD)-IIV compared to SD-IIV and (2) two doses of SD-IIV compared to one dose of SD-IIV in the same
influenza season. The first study compared HD-IIV vs.SD-IIV in adult SOT recipients and noted that HD-IIV
was safe and reported higher immunogenicity; however, the median post-transplant period was 38 months. In
another phase II trial of adult SOT recipients, two doses of SD-IIV a month apart compared to one-dose of SD-
IIV revealed increased immunogenicity, with a median post-transplant period of 18 months. Therefore, these
studies lack evaluation in the early post-transplant period in this vulnerable population. Additionally, the
administration of two-doses of HD-IIV in the same influenza season has not been evaluated in SOT recipients.
Thus, the optimal immunization strategy for SOT recipients less than 12 months post-transplant is unknown. In
addition, the immunologic predictors and correlates of influenza vaccine immunogenicity in SOT recipients
have not been well-defined. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that adult SOT recipients that are
1-11 months out from transplant and are receiving two doses of HD-IIV will have higher
hemagglutination inhibition geometric mean titers (GMT) to influenza A antigens compared to adult
SOT recipients receiving two doses of SD-IIV over one influenza season. To test this hypothesis and
address the critical knowledge gaps outlined above, we propose to conduct a phase II, multi-center,
randomized-controlled immunogenicity and safety trial comparing either one dose of HD-IIV, two doses of SD-
IIV, or two doses of HD-IIV in adult kidney, heart, and/or liver SOT recipients 1-11 months post-transplant. The
results of this study will address significant knowledge gaps regarding influenza vaccine strategies and
immune responses in adult SOT recipients and will guide vaccine recommendations in the early post-
transplant period."

Transgender (trans) women across the globe experience a disproportionate burden of HIV with an estimated
global HIV prevalence of 19%. Trans women living with HIV also have worse HIV care and treatment outcomes
than cisgender adults, including lower rates of viral suppression. Multilevel responses are needed to improve
HIV outcomes among trans women by simultaneously and synergistically addressing individual, provider, and
community dynamics. Trans women experience intersectional stigma due to the frequent association between
trans identity, HIV, and sex work. These intersecting forms of stigma include internalized stigma in the form of
applying negative beliefs and enacted stigma in the form of exclusion and discrimination. Developing social
cohesion can be a critical first step in community processes to address stigma. We adapted a multilevel
intervention, Abriendo Puertas (Opening Doors), including individual counseling, peer navigation, and
community mobilization for trans women living with HIV in the Dominican Republic using an iterative
consultation process. We assessed feasibility and initial effects on HIV care and treatment behaviors with 30
trans women living with HIV (no control group) and documented positive trends in ART use (70% to 85%,
p=0.03), missed care appointments (35% to 20%, p=0.39) and ART adherence (86% to 96%, p=0.50).
Participants emphasized that trusting intervention staff and being treated with respect in individual sessions
allowed them to improve self-esteem. Limited trust and cohesion among trans women, however, inhibited more
extensive engagement with peer navigation and community activities. In response, we identified two key
modifications to strengthen and further tailor the intervention for trans women living with HIV: 1) integrate more
gender affirming content, including with providers and 2) focus on building trust among trans women through
sequential implementation of individual and then community components. The purpose of the proposed study
is to conduct a pilot randomized trial of the GAP model, or Gender-affirming Abriendo Puertas. In Aim 1, we will
assess preliminary efficacy of the GAP intervention on viral suppression among trans women
randomized to the intervention compared to those randomized to control. We will randomly assign trans
women living with HIV to the GAP intervention (n=60) (individual counseling, peer navigation, provider training,
and community support building) or control group (n=60). We will conduct baseline, 6, and 12-month surveys
and viral load assessments to assess differences across study arms. In Aim 2, we will examine pathways of
influence (e.g. decreased stigma, increased cohesion) and experiences with the intervention to identify
specific areas for improvement and scale up. We will conduct longitudinal qualitative interviews at baseline,
6, and 12 months with 20 intervention participants and, together with surveys, assess how GAP participation
affects pathways between stigma, cohesion, and HIV outcomes. We will also elicit experiences and
recommendations from providers and intervention staff in focus groups at 6 (n=2) and 12 months (n=2)."

Lipid droplets are the intracellular sites for fat storage, with essential functions in lipid metabolism and energy
storage. They also have a second major role in controlling the fate of specific proteins, namely mediating their
maturation, transport, refolding, storage, and turnover. While there has been great progress in unraveling how
droplets control lipid metabolism, studies of their protein-handling roles remain limited. The goal of this project
is to dissect the mechanism, regulation, and physiological relevance of this protein handling function, by taking
advantage of the best characterized example of this phenomenon, the sequestration of histone H2Av to lipid
droplets in Drosophila ovaries and embryos. H2Av is dynamically stored, exchanging constantly between lipid
droplets via the cytoplasm. Lipid droplet sequestration prevents H2Av degradation in oocytes and its premature
import into nuclei in embryos. It is also developmentally regulated, being switched off in embryos at the mid-
blastula transition. Progress in the last granting period identified the importins Impa2 and Ipo9 as critical
factors mediating H2Av exchange, uncovered a correlation between the activity of the cell cycle kinase Cdk1,
the phosphorylation state of Impa2, and the rate of H2Av exchange, and discovered that excess nuclear H2Av
dramatically alters the transcriptome. These insights led to new models about the mechanism of H2Av
exchange, its regulation, and its biological role, models that the current application proposes to test. It is
hypothesized that Impa2 promotes H2Av exchange by physically interacting with Jabba and reducing its
affinity to H2Av and that Ipo9 acts as cytoplasmic chaperone, accompanying H2Av on its journey between
LDs. This model will be tested by determining intracellular distribution and dynamics of the two importins in
ovaries and embryos and by analyzing how mutants in key functional domains affect H2Av exchange. To
understand the developmental regulation, point mutants in Impa2 will be generated to prevent or mimic
phosphorylation and Cdk1 activity will be inhibited. The consequences of these manipulations for H2Av
exchange and the physical interactions between importins, the H2Av anchor Jabba, and H2Av will be
determined. In nurse cells lacking Jabba, absence of sequestration results in increased levels of nuclear H2Av.
Using RNA seq analysis, manipulation of H2Av dosage, and Jabba mutants unable to bind H2Av, it will be
determined whether the altered H2Av levels result in changes to the transcriptome. If successful, these studies
will test key predictions about the mechanism, regulation, and function of H2Av sequestration by lipid droplets
and develop general paradigms for how protein handling by lipid droplets can control processes elsewhere in
the cell. These studies will thus provide the groundwork for determining if and how protein sequestration by
lipid droplets contributes to their prominent roles in health and disease."

Mucin glycoproteins are the essential component of mucus and the epithelial cellular glycocalyx. Mucins are
essential for life in creatures from jellyfish to humans and play roles in hydration, lubrication, nutrient absorption,
and host defense against pathogens. Mucin glycosylation is regulated by complex enzymatic pathways subject
to flux, resulting in heterogeneous and variable glycan patterns that vary between tissues and species, and that
evolve in response to diet and disease. The Kramer Lab is developing synthetic mucins, or synMUCs, that
harness the chemical and biophysical properties of native mucins but have molecularly tunable structures.
Polymerization of glycosylated amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides affords high molecular weight polypeptides with
the native peptide and glycan linkages. Compared to short peptides, polysaccharides, or traditional polymers
bearing attached sugars, synMUCs are the most authentic mucin mimics to date. The synMUCs will be applied
in engineered models of the glycocalyx and secreted mucus. These models will find broad future application in
studies of epithelial biology with application in cancer, drug delivery, immunity, and infection. Since mucins are
on the front lines of cellular defense, diverse viruses have evolved strategies to adhere to their glycans, alter
them, and even use them to enter host cells for replication. Virus-mucin binding can have outcomes on viral
diffusion, tissue specificity, and replication but molecular details are lacking due to mucin heterogeneity. We will
chemoenzymatically modify our synMUCs to display virus-binding sialic acid glycans. Viral binding preferences
for various sialic acid structures in different densities and from varied peptide backbone compositions will be
defined. The sialic-acid-bearing-synMUCs will be utilized to probe how mucins in the glycocalyx vs mucus
regulate adhesion, cell entry and replication, tissue tropism and viral gene evolution. This knowledge will shed
light on fundamental aspects of the viral life cycle and may assist in improving human health though development
of new antiviral therapeutics and disease transmission prevention strategies. Additionally, scientific citizenship
and mentoring are a priority and active involvement in supporting equity, diversity and inclusion of
underrepresented groups in STEM will be a focus for the duration of the project and beyond."

The proposed project will test an innovative approach to reducing harms related to the epidemics of injection
drug use, overdoses, hepatitis C (HCV), and to imminent HIV outbreaks, in rural Appalachian Kentucky which
has long been an epicenter of these intertwined crises. Our research has shown that the region has high rates
of HCV, overdose, injection drug use, condomless sex, and dense risk networks that could kindle an HIV
outbreak. Following a 2014 HIV outbreak in neighboring Indiana and a national analysis of HIV/HCV outbreak
vulnerability among people who inject drugs (PWID) revealing that 54 of Kentucky’s 120 counties ranked in the
top 5% nationally, Kentucky passed landmark legislation permitting counties to operate syringe service
programs (SSPs). Despite an arduous county-level approval process, Kentucky has succeeded in opening 80
SSPs, more than any other U.S. state. Unfortunately, this robust harm reduction infrastructure remains under-
utilized in rural settings. Data from our research funded by NIDA’s National Rural Opioid Initiative revealed that
nearly half of PWID had never used the existing staffed SSPs and, over 24 months of follow-up, SSP uptake
remained low and program drop-out was not uncommon. The most frequent reason cited for having never
used an SSP was fear of stigma. Evidence suggests that PWID in the region want a range of harm reduction
service models, and among those who report stigma as a reason for not using the staffed SSPs, the most
desired model is a vending machine, or ‘kiosk’. Harm reduction kiosks have been operating globally for more
than 30 years and research has demonstrated that they can expand syringe access. Yet very few kiosks
operate in the U.S., and none operate in rural areas where they might be especially beneficial. Research
suggests that kiosks might be a cost-effective way to expand syringe access when coupled with staffed SSPs
but their implementation, impact, and cost-effectiveness have not been rigorously evaluated. In response, we
propose a type 1 hybrid effectiveness trial to test the effectiveness, implementation outcomes, and cost
effectiveness of a community-tailored, harm reduction kiosk in reducing HIV, hepatitis C, and overdose risk
behavior in rural Appalachia. Our kiosk, or KyOSK (KY Outreach Service Kiosk), will be supplied with
injection equipment, naloxone, fentanyl test strips, hygiene kits, condoms, and other supplies as well as an
innovative call-back feature for facilitated referral to needed services by trained recovery coaches. The KyOSK
will be tailored to the local context through a community-engaged process and a Kiosk Design Team involving
people who use drugs and local and state leaders. Interest in reduction kiosks is soaring nationwide and the
proposed project would provide critical and timely data to inform scale-up of this model, especially in rural
areas of the country that have been severely impacted by substance use related harms."

Synthesis and Discovery Core
This Phase II COBRE will continue on its mission to focus a diverse team of scientists on the discovery of new
molecules that probe the function of biological targets. During Phase I, our COBRE developed an instrumentation
core, unique to the state of Delaware, that enabled molecular discovery, purification and analysis. The growth of
our center and the breadth of services offered through our core facilities have prompted us to reorganize this
instrumentation into two core facilities for Phase II: the Synthesis and Discovery (SD) Core Facility and the
Analytical Chemistry Core Facility. The proposed Synthesis and Discovery (SD) Core Facility consists of
instrumentation and infrastructure for small molecule synthesis, high throughput catalyst discovery, computation
and microscopy capabilities that will continue to be broadly used by researchers across the IDeA network and
beyond. During Phase II, we will expand the scope of the facility to provide chemistry services to non-specialists
across the biomedical research spectrum. The facility will enable biologists, biochemists, engineers, and others
access to custom synthesis of molecules they cannot easily make them themselves. The goals of the SD Core
Facility will include (1) the development of an administrative framework for the facility and the recruitment of staff
to provide core services, and (2) establishment of a Custom Synthesis Laboratory (CSL) that will provide a broad
array of synthetic services including small molecule synthesis, purification, chemical assay development and
high throughput reaction development and parallel synthesis."
10876440,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Gram-negative bacteria are increasingly challenging to combat because existing antibiotics struggle to reach 
their intracellular targets and face elimination by efflux pumps. This issue is particularly pressing for bacteria 
that establish a replication-permissive vacuole derived from the host's plasma membrane. Shielded by multiple 
layers of membranes, intracellular pathogens become inaccessible to traditional antibiotics. A fundamental gap 
persists in the current understanding of how bacterial pathogens subvert host membrane transport processes 
and continued existence of this gap impedes our understanding of mechanisms that bacterial pathogens use to 
coordinate virulence strategies. Our long-term goal is to address this gap by systematically unveiling the host 
pathways critical for infection of human lung macrophages by the bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila, 
the causative agent of a severe pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease. Legionella infects lung 
macrophages and resists degradation by establishing and residing within a membrane-bound compartment 
known as the Legionella-containing vacuole. Initially derived from the host cell's plasma membrane, this 
vacuolar membrane is dramatically remodeled during infection. To do so, the bacterium immediately begins 
translocating a large number of (effector) proteins directly into the host cytosol. The host membrane trafficking 
network is a major target of L. pneumophila effector proteins. In particular, vesicles traveling between the 
endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi are sequestered by the Legionella-containing vacuole early during 
infection, whereas fusion with degradative lysosomes is prevented. These observations support the working 
model that the pathogen orchestrates its molecular interactions with the host to stimulate or inhibit fusion of 
host vesicles with its vacuole. Delineating the spatiotemporal distribution of secreted effectors is a critical step 
to understanding how L. pneumophila interacts with the host cell to ensure its own survival. The overall 
objective is to examine the spatiotemporal localization of L. pneumophila effector proteins in the context of 
human macrophage infection and to determine how L. pneumophila effectors interact with host 
phosphoinositide lipids to target membrane compartments. We propose: (1) to use a dual pronged approach 
based on chemical biology to directly track localization of L. pneumophila effectors in infected human 
macrophages, and (2) to characterize the protein-lipid interface between L. pneumophila effectors identified in 
our preliminary screen using X-ray crystallography. The proposed research is significant because it is 
positioned to advance our understanding of how bacterial pathogens manipulate host membrane transport 
pathways to promote intracellular survival of bacteria. A significant collateral outcome is that these studies 
could suggest new molecular targets for intervention in L. pneumophila infections and related conditions."

Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a global public health crisis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causes ~1.3 million 
deaths each year. 5% of new Mtb infections are drug-resistant, driving an urgent clinical need for new anti-Mtb 
therapeutics. This proposal supports efforts to combat drug-resistant Mtb by dissecting the function and 
pharmacological dysregulation of Clp proteases, a family of novel antibacterial targets. Clp proteases harness 
chemical energy to destroy folded proteins in the cytosol of bacteria. Clp proteases are essential in mycobacteria, 
and compounds that disrupt their function can kill Mtb and potentially treat drug-resistant tuberculosis. Our prior 
work on Mtb Clp proteases revealed distinctive characteristics that set them apart from well-studied homologs. 
We hypothesize that mycobacteria exploit these characteristics to regulate Clp protease assembly and activity 
across stages of mycobacterial growth and infection. However, no studies have yet examined how these features 
contribute to mycobacterial physiology, and this deficiency in our understanding hampers efforts to develop Clp- 
targeting therapeutics. This sub-project aims to addresses outstanding questions surrounding Mtb Clp protease 
regulation, and to develop compounds optimized to target Mtb Clp proteases. In Aim 1, we will interrogate Clp 
protease regulation by investigating how and when Clp proteases form proteolytically active complexes. We will 
use biophysical approaches to define the kinetic trajectory of assembly, and identify active and inactive complex 
intermediates that form along the assembly pathway. Additionally, we will use a model mycobacterial system to 
correlate assembly state and activity state within the cell. Understanding these details will improve our ability to 
effectively target these enzymes during infection. In Aim 2, we seek to elaborate existing chemical scaffolds to 
create new compounds optimized to target Mtb Clp enzymes. We will develop novel probes that modulate or 
report on Clp protease assembly, and new lead compounds with improved affinity and target selectivity. 
Structural information, together with our existing toolbox of biochemical assays, will guide compound 
development and will be used to evaluate compound affinity and selectivity. We will also create and screen a 
compound library, derived from an existing scaffold, to identify novel leads. Together, these studies will expand 
our understanding of Mtb Clp protease function, and support the development of therapeutics capable of 
combating drug-resistant tuberculosis."

 Difficulty understanding speech in noisy backgrounds, reduced sound-level tolerance and tinnitus are the
most common complaints associated with noise- and age-related hearing loss. Parsing the sensory vs. neural
contributions to these impairments gained new traction from animal studies showing that hair cell death (and
the threshold shift it produces) is often preceded by loss of hair cell synapses with auditory nerve fibers. This
cochlear neural degeneration (CND) degrades auditory processing and may contribute to difficulties
understanding speech, especially in noisy environments, but has little effect on thresholds in quiet until it
becomes extreme. CND could also be a major contributor to the genesis of tinnitus and hyperacusis, via an
induction of central-gain adjustment secondary to the loss of auditory input to the central nervous system.
 Over the last grant period, we showed correlations between inferred measures of CND and word-
recognition performance in difficult listening environments among normal-hearing listeners. Over the next five
years, we broaden our focus to include those with threshold shifts. In Aim 1 we study high-tone hearing-loss,
because temporal bone studies show that CND will be worse, despite normal thresholds in the speech-
frequency region. In Aim 2 we study the flat hearing loss in late-stage Ménière's, because CND may be
particularly severe in this disorder. In both, we test the correlation of the word-score outcomes with a battery of
physiological measures chosen to probe the early stages of auditory processing, i.e. distortion product
otoacoustic emissions and high-frequency audiometry to evaluate OHC function, threshold-in-noise tests and
pitch-masking tasks to identify cochlear dead regions, and electrocochleography (including stacked ABRs),
envelope-following responses to rectangular envelopes and middle-ear-muscle reflexes to probe for CND and
assess its severity as a function of cochlear location. A medial olivocochlear reflex assay will evaluate the
potential for hyperresponsivity of brainstem circuits. In Aim 3, we test if CND is a major elicitor of tinnitus and
hyperacusis by assessing the relationships between our physiological estimates of CND, word-identification
tasks, and several psychophysical measures of tinnitus and sound level tolerance. In concert with Project 4,
which will further examine the same subjects, we will directly probe the relation between estimated CND and
central manifestations of neural hyperactivity, perceptual hypersensitivity and behavioral hyperreactivity.
 The successful completion of these Aims will determine if, and to what extent, markers consistent with
CND are associated with the speech intelligibility deficits observed in patients with SNHL and will clarify the
association between biomarkers of peripheral neural deficits with psychophysical measures of tinnitus and
sound-level intolerance. Given progress in the repair of noise-induced cochlear neural degeneration in animal
models, reliable markers of CND in humans are needed to identify candidates for future therapeutics and to
track the efficacy of any treatments designed to rebuild a damaged inner ear."
10896026,"Project 4 – Project Summary
Hearing disorders are typically studied and treated from the perspective of wanting to make inaudible sounds
audible. Yet three of the most common and debilitating adult hearing complaints reflect just the opposite problem:
not what persons cannot hear, but what they cannot stop hearing. Older adults or persons with a history of noise
exposure are often assaulted by the irrepressible perception of phantom sounds (tinnitus), they experience
moderate intensity sounds as loud, distressing, or even painful (hyperacusis), and they struggle to suppress the
awareness of background noise sources when listening to a target speaker. Although age, noise exposure, and
hearing status are risk factors for these perceptual disorders, the connection is indirect at best, prompting much
speculation about the intervening neural processes that may be more closely related. Animal research suggests
that the underlying cause of these disorders may be rooted in a dialog gone wrong between cochlear primary
afferent neurons and neurons in sound processing centers of the brain. Cochlear neural degeneration (CND)
has been shown to trigger a compensatory plasticity process in the central auditory pathway that often over-
shoots the mark, rendering central auditory neurons hyperactive, hypersensitive, hyper-synchronized, and
internally ‘noisy’. A broad consensus from work published in many animal species and hearing loss paradigms
suggests that maladaptive central plasticity that arises as a consequence of CND is proximally linked to the
behavioral manifestation of tinnitus, hyperacusis, and selective difficulties hearing in noise. This hypothesis has
been difficult to test in human subjects owing to the challenge of measuring risk factors, auditory peripheral
status, central plasticity signatures, and detailed behavioral phenotyping of these hearing disorders in the same
subjects. Here, by performing central neural, autonomic, and psychophysical measurements in the same
subjects that have also undergone extensive auditory peripheral testing in Project 3, we have developed an
innovative and exhaustive approach to put this hypothesis to the test in human subjects. Aim 1 of Project 4 will
use novel EEG measures to test the hypothesis that more pronounced levels of estimated CND (CNDe) is
associated with increased neural gain, poor neural encoding of rapid stimulus temporal features, and poor neural
suppression of task-irrelevant noise sources. Aim 2 will utilize novel autonomic measures of sound-evoked
changes in pupil dilation, skin conductance, heart rate, and micro facial expressions to test the hypothesis that
more pronounced CNDe is associated with abnormally strong autonomic recruitment during effortful listening
and in response to emotionally evocative sounds. Aim 3 will combine the neural and autonomic measures above
with detailed behavioral phenotyping. Using causal mediation analysis, Aim 3 will determine how CNDe, central
gain, temporal encoding, distractor noise source suppression, and affective sound processing specifically relate
to a spectrum of suprathreshold hearing disorders, as identified by measurements of multi-talker speech
intelligibility, tinnitus psychoacoustics, tinnitus burden, loudness psychoacoustics, and hyperacusis burden."

Protein analysis is essential to the understanding of molecular scale processes in living systems, the diagnosis
of diseases based on molecular biomarkers, and the treatment of diseases with drugs. The basic tasks of protein
analysis include detecting a protein, identifying it and determining its interactions with other proteins or molecular
ligands. Various technologies have been developed to perform these tasks, but the most indispensable ones are
gel and capillary electrophoresis, Western Blot (WB) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These
technologies separate and identify proteins based on a protein’s charge, size, and specific binding to antibodies.
For molecular interaction analysis, surface plasmon resonance and other detection technologies are the current
choices. Although ubiquitous in both research labs and industry, these platforms must be combined to provide
complete analysis of proteins, which is complicated and time consuming. In addition, they lack single molecule
analysis capability required for studying heterogenous processes and for achieving precision diagnosis,
especially for low volume samples. The present project aims to develop one detection platform that can perform
the key functions of the above technologies with single molecule detection capability. The proposed technology
images single proteins without labels, measures the size, charge and mobility of each protein simultaneously,
identifies the protein based on its specific binding to antibodies, and quantifies its interactions with other proteins
in real time. The team at the Biodesign Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors, ASU, has carried out
substantial experiments to demonstrate the proposed technology. In this R01 project, the team will address
remaining technical challenges, build a complete prototype and validate it for single protein analysis on single
cells."

Estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer (BC) accounts for the majority of all diagnosed BC for women
in the United States. While traditional antihormone therapies for ER+ BC are initially effective, approximately
40% of ER+ BC will develop therapy resistant recurrence and metastasis, which contributes to most BC related
deaths. The presence of the G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) is suggested to aid in disease
progression and metastasis of BC and GPER is theorized to be a driver of therapy resistance due to the
agonistic activity of tamoxifen, a traditional antihormone therapy for ER+ BC. GPER is expressed on cancer-
associated fibroblasts, the main remodelers of the extracellular matrix (ECM) which plays an important role in
disease progression. Previous work by Dr. Suzanne Ponik and collaborators has demonstrated dynamic
interactions between hormone signaling and ECM stiffness to drive tumor cell invasion and metastasis.
However, the mechanism responsible for these dynamic interactions is poorly understood. Therefore, the
hypothesis for the proposed research is that GPER activated CAFs are priming the TME to drive
tamoxifen resistant disease progression in ER+ BC. The research strategy proposes to establish the
specific role GPER activated CAFs play on ECM protein deposition and organization in vitro prior to introducing
GPER knockdown CAFs into an orthotropic ER+, tamoxifen resistant tumor model. The in vitro and in vivo
work will be complemented with a novel tumor microarray (TMA) from BC patients where the association
between GPER expression, ECM signatures, administered therapy and patient outcome can be validated. The
specific aims of this proposal are: 1) identify how GPER signaling in CAFs regulates biophysical/biochemical
cues and how GPER-mediated matrix deposition influences tumor cell behavior in vitro, 2) test the hypothesis
that ECM stiffness and antihormone therapy synergize through GPER signaling in CAFs to drive tumor
progression in vivo, and 3) define how GPER expression and ECM signatures relate to human disease/patient
outcomes. The research training for this proposal will be conducted under the co-sponsorship of Dr. Suzanne
Ponik (Sponsor) and Dr. Mark Burkard (Co-Sponsor) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Both Dr. Ponik
and Dr. Burkard will provide mentorship on the research conducted by Shelby Fertal as well as provide
guidance for her career development with the intention that Shelby will remain in academia. The success of
this proposal will offer novel insights into the mechanisms of antihormone therapy driven disease progression
in ER+ BC and provide a solid foundation for Shelby’s career as an independent research professor."

 The orthopoxvirus (OPXV) genus is home to many severe mammalian pathogens, including variola
(VARV) and Mpox (MPXV). Though VARV was eradicated in 1980, OPXVs remain a significant public health
threat; the recent worldwide outbreak of MPXV has highlighted the susceptibility of individuals to OPXV infection,
the sub-optimal efficacy of current FDA-approved vaccines, and the limited options to treat active infections.
These concerns are amplified by the fact that the pathogenesis of OPXVs remains poorly understood. In
principle, OPXV virulence is attributed to the myriad of ‘immunoevasins’ they encode. However, many of these
proteins do not have well-defined functions. Given the critical need for more robust strategies to combat OPXV
infection, it is essential to define the major determinants of OPXV virulence. One promising avenue of study
focuses on the B22 protein family, which comprises a group of glycoproteins that are conserved across all
pathogenic OPXVs. In ectromelia (ECTV), the cause of mousepox, we found that its B22 family member, C15,
is essential for mortality and pathogenesis in mice. Functionally, our lab has demonstrated that C15 potently
inhibits both natural killer (NK) cell-mediated control and T cell activation during ECTV infection, highlighting the
capacity for C15 to target both the innate and adaptive immune response. However, much of the underlying cell
biology of C15 (and B22 proteins by extension) as well as the structural basis for its activity remain unknown,
limiting potential as a therapeutic target.
 This proposal, composed of two aims, outlines an investigative approach to define the molecular
underpinnings of C15 biology and immunomodulation to facilitate greater understanding of its molecular
mechanisms and potential targeting as an anti-OPXV therapeutic strategy. This work will be completed at CHOP
under the guidance of Drs. Laurence Eisenlohr and Nikolaos Sgourakis. Aim 1 will establish the functional
necessity and outcome of C15 proteolytic processing using i) mutagenesis of potential cleavage sites coupled
with T and NK cell functional assays and ii) systematic deletion coupled with analysis of proteolytic processing
and sub-cellular localization. Aim 2 will define the C15 structural domains that are necessary for its antagonism
of both NK and T cells. Here, we will use i) structure-guided deletions to identify the contributions of putative
domains to immunomodulatory function and ii) recombinant protein technology to solve the structure and
evaluate the activity of a putative MHC class I-like domain. Together, these aims will enable critical mechanistic
insights into a potent virulence factor conserved across all pathogenic OPXVs, linking critical processing events
and structural domains to virulence. Ultimately, this work will lay the foundation for further studies to investigate
the targeting of B22 family proteins as a potential antiviral strategy against OPXVs. Furthermore, this work will
provide critical training in techniques, data analysis and scientific communication that will support a career as an
academic principal investigator."

Oligodendrocyte lineage cells (OLCs) are the myelin-producing cells in the central nervous system, which
possess ion channels and are sensitive to neuronal activity. P/Q-type channels are voltage-gated calcium
channels that are present in neurons and OLCs, and though their function in neurons has been studied, the role
of these channels in OLCs is unknown. Mutations in CACNA1A, the human gene that encodes the main pore-
forming subunit of P/Q-type channels, have been shown to cause neurological disorders including episodic
ataxia, epilepsy, and intellectual disability in human patients. Studying the role of P/Q-type channels in OLCs will
aid in understanding CACNA1A-related disorder pathophysiology and may uncover new targets for treatment.
In this study, I will use zebrafish as a model to produce mutations in CACNA1A equivalent genes in OLCs during
development, then use in vivo imaging with fluorescent transgenes to determine if myelin formation and calcium
signaling is disrupted in OLCs with disrupted P/Q-type channels. My preliminary findings show P/Q-type channel
mutations in OLCs cause reduced developmental myelination. To test how P/Q-type channels are involved in
CACNA1A-related disorder pathology, I will generate a global mutant zebrafish to model CACNA1A-related
disorders by using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis to produce mutations replicating those found in
CACNA1A-related disorders. I will use fluorescent imaging to assess developmental myelination in this mutant,
and I will use whole-brain calcium imaging and a motor assay to evaluate neural function relevant to ataxia seen
in human disease. I will also generate a transgenic mutant zebrafish line with mutant P/Q-type channels in all
cells and wild-type P/Q-type channels expressed specifically in OLCs to determine how OLC P/Q-type channels
are involved in CACNA1A-related disorder pathology. To further understand the role of P/Q-type channels in
OLC development, I will perform whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in OLCs in the developing zebrafish spinal
cord. By measuring currents in developing OLCs in wild-type and mutant zebrafish with and without ion channel
agonists and antagonists, I will be able to directly measure changes in OLC electrophysiological properties due
to P/Q-type channel mutations. These experiments will establish the new method of whole-cell patch-clamp
recording from zebrafish spinal cord OLCs and lay the groundwork for many future studies. Together, this study
will provide fundamental insights of ion channel function in OLCs as well as OLC involvement in CACNA1A-
related disorders and provide future directions for understanding the role of OLCs in neurological disease."

(CKD), which, respectively, affect more than 9% and 15% of the adult US population. Higher
urine oxalate (UOx) can lead to calcium oxalate KS and CKD incidence and progression. The
gut microbiome plays a key role in human oxalate homeostasis, which differs between stone
formers (SF) and non-stone formers (NSF). In SF, rates of oxalate absorption and endogenous
oxalate synthesis are higher than in NSF. The determinants of UOx and their interplay are still
unknown limiting our ability to develop therapeutics to treat hyperoxaluria. Our data demonstrate
oxalate degradation in the human intestine is performed by multiple bacterial species (the
oxalobiome) with variable contributions to global oxalate metabolism and that alteration of the
oxalobiome function is associated with higher UOx in SF. In mice, we showed that the gut
microbiota is an important determinant of UOx and colonization with an oxalate degrader
(Oxalobacter formigenes) led to lower UOx. We hypothesize that the gut microbiome is a
major determinant of UOx, and its manipulation can reduce UOx levels. The overarching
goal of this proposal is to better understand how gut microbial metabolism of dietary oxalate is
linked to UOx levels within a host and can serve as a potential therapeutic target. We propose
to leverage the rich resources available for participants in the Nurses' Health Study II (n = 584
women; 218 SF and 366 NSF) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (n = 308 men; 58
SF and 250 NSF), including existing and to be completed sequencing data from fecal samples,
existing genomic data, 24-hour UOx, validated dietary information, comorbidities, and
medication use. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate the metaorganismal oxalate degrading function
in determining UOx, and whether it differs in SF and NSF by performing additional sequencing
and analyzing metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from fecal samples to quantify the
oxalobiome function and then conduct comprehensive multi-layer microbiome data analysis
around the oxalobiome. In Aim 2, we will identify the interwoven role of gut microbiome, host
genetics, comorbidities, and dietary information in determining UOx. In Aim 3 we will test the
role of the oxalobiome in UOx excretion and the efficacy of several probiotic combinations in
reducing UOx. In these multidisciplinary, computational, translational, and animal-model based
investigations, we aim to reveal a role for the gut oxalobiome in urinary oxalate excretion with
the goal of developing therapeutic approaches for the treatment and prevention of the adverse
effects of oxalate in humans."

Mitochondria are most popularly known as the powerhouse of the cell due to their role in ATP production.
However, new and emerging roles for the mitochondria are continuously being discovered, providing new
avenues for investigating various diseases. One of these aspects is understanding how mitochondria
morphology contributes to mitochondria function. Neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic disorders, and heart
failure all have evidence of mitochondria dysfunction with evidence of abnormal mitochondria morphology.
Knowledge of how mitochondria morphology is regulated could provide a new spotlight on new potential drug
targets that could help alleviate a broad spectrum of diseases. A series of GTPases regulate the fusion and
division of the inner and outer mitochondria membranes. Optic Atrophy 1 (OPA1) is the GTPase responsible
for the fusion of the mitochondrial inner membrane. There are many isoforms of OPA1 which are categorized
as the active long-form OPA1 which can be proteolytically cleaved to produce inactive short-form OPA1.
Interestingly, depletion of a mitochondrial chaperonin, Heat Shock Protein Family E Member 1 (HSPE1),
promotes the cleavage of OPA1 into the inactive short-from. Mitochondrial chaperonin facilitates proper protein
folding within the mitochondria since most proteins are translated outside the mitochondria and imported
through the inner and outer membranes. To maintain mitochondrial proteostasis, HSPE1 functions with co-
chaperonin, Heat Shock Protein Family D Member 1 (HSPD1). However, only depletion of HSPE1 leads to
cleavage of OPA1, indicating HSPE1 could have new and exciting functions beyond its canonical role as a
chaperonin. Thus, the main goal of this project is to investigate how regulation of mitochondria proteostasis
could impact mitochondria dynamics through the following specific aims. Aim 1 looks to identify the interactors
of HSPE1 and HSPD1 using proximity labeling combined with mass spectrometry. Subsequent depletion of
these interactors using RNAi is expected to influence OPA1 cleavage. Aim 2 will investigate the role of long-
form OPA1 compared to short-form OPA1. Aside from favoring mitochondria division, there is no clear census
on the function of these short-form OPA1. Aim 2 proposes to overexpress short-form OPA1 to see whether
there are changes to mitochondrial morphology, ATP production, and mitochondrial DNA localization. Similarly,
Overexpression of uncleavable long-form OPA1 will assess whether the mitochondria dysfunction caused by
HSPE1 depletion can be rescued. These specific aims are crucial in understanding how changes in
mitochondria proteostasis can affect mitochondria dynamics and vice versa."

Immunotherapies that boost anti-tumor T cells are landmark breakthroughs in oncology. Yet, current
immunotherapies directly activate T cells and are therefore ineffective in ~80% of tumors with few T cells (“cold”
tumors). Thus, a primary challenge in oncology is to develop effective immunotherapies for cold tumors.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a prime example – ~91% of tumors have few T cells, and thus
PDAC rarely responds to current immunotherapies (<2% response rate). Yet, immunotherapy is the most
promising option in PDAC, as all other therapies have failed, and only the rare (9%) patients with immunogenic
“hot” tumors (high density of intratumoral T cells) survive long-term. Thus, new immunotherapies are urgently
needed for PDAC, and the principles can be applied to other cold tumors.
To discover new targets that active immunity in PDAC, we contrasted immune cells in hot tumors from rare long-
term PDAC survivors to those in more typical cold tumors from short-term survivors. Unexpectedly, we found
that hot tumors have ~3-fold higher densities of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) (Moral et al., Nature, 2020).
ILC2s are lymphocytes that amplify CD4+ Th2 cells in infection but paradoxically can activate CD8+ T cells in
tumors. Using mouse models, we found that ILC2s recruit CD103+ dendritic cells to activate CD8+ T cells and
suppress primary PDACs. Through further studies, we have now found that unlike currently presumed, ILC2s
can also migrate to suppress metastatic PDAC tumors, express lymphotoxin (LT), a protein that induces tertiary
lymphoid structures in tumors, and express the immune checkpoint PD-1 that regulates their anti-tumor function.
As we are the first group to report that ILC2s can activate immunity in PDAC, the mechanisms by which ILC2s
suppress PDACs, which can thus inform rational strategies to harness them in immunotherapies, are unknown.
Thus, we now propose to study how ILC2s migrate to tumors, activate CD8+ T cells, and are functionally
regulated. Through integrated, multi-disciplinary study of ILC2 phenotype and function in human PDAC patients,
patient-derived organoids, and functional studies in mouse models, we will: 1) define the cytokines that mobilize
anti-tumor ILC2s; 2) investigate how anti-tumor ILC2s utilize LT to activate CD8+ T cells; and 3) demonstrate
how PD-1 blockade enhances anti-tumor ILC2 function. To ensure a cross-disciplinary approach, we will use an
experienced team of investigators with complementary skills in PDAC biology, ILC2 immunology,
immunotherapy, organoid models, and computational oncology. We expect our proposal will lay the scientific
framework to understand ILC2 cancer biology and guide efforts to harness ILC2s in new immunotherapies."
10904896,"T cells play a critical role eliminating pathogens and the generation of memory T cells is an important component in protection from secondary infection. Memory T cells can be divided into two groups based on their location, those that are capable of circulating throughout the body and those that are lodged in tissues, poised to respond rapidly to secondary infection. Tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm) cells remain in the tissue and are not replenished by circulating cells after infection is resolved. Circulating T cells are often not sufficient to protect from secondary infection; therefore, it is of significant interest to determine how Trm cells are generated and maintain their function over time. Only a small number of microbes need to breach the mucosal surface to initiate disease. The ability of adaptive immune cells to locate pathogens in large, complex tissues and eliminate them before they disseminate to deeper tissues is a necessary component of protective immunity. We have used infection with the intestinal pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis to examine pathogen-specific CD8+ Trm during infection, and using this model we have uncovered significant phenotypic heterogeneity in intestinal Trm cells, with expression of the integrin CD103 defining these populations. Proximity of T cells to areas of infection within the intestinal tissue regulates Trm differentiation, with inflammation and activation of the transcription factor STAT4 leading to increased numbers of CD103 Trm cells. This proposal will identify the underlying mechanisms that regulate the differentiation and maintenance of the CD103 Trm subset. We have already shown a critical role for CD103 Trm cells in controlling pathogen replication during primary infection, and we have developed new tools to analyze the division of labor between Trm subsets during secondary infection. These findings will address a fundamental gap in our knowledge regarding the function of Trm cells in controlling intestinal colonization during secondary infection. Additionally, it is currently unclear whether either Trm subset alone is sufficient to confer protection, and we will determine if the full complement of Trm cells is necessary for robust immunity. This work will identify strategies to maximize the number and persistence of Trm cells, an important component of any successful vaccination strategy to target mucosal pathogens."

Working parents of children with mental health disabilities (MHD) experience chronic stress linked to the unpredictable
tasks associated with caring for a child with a disability and workplace flexibility practices. These contextual non-work
factors contribute to increased loss of employment among this group of vulnerable workers. Courtesy stigmatization,
defined as negative perceptions, and associated discriminating attitudes and behaviors projected towards family
members of children with mental health disorders leads parents to carefully control the dissemination of their child's
health information. Disclosure comes with threats to privacy and confidentiality, and the potential for discrimination and
retaliation. Parents of children with MHD do experience discrimination and retaliation at work, such as being denied
promotions and career opportunities or getting fired from their jobs because of public misperceptions related to the
etiology of children's mental health1, 2. This can result in decisional conflict for parents of children with MHD regarding
whether or not to disclose their child's mental health status to coworkers and supervisors. Disclosure to supervisors
may provide parents of children with MHD access to needed flexibility and social support but it can also lead to
discrimination, retaliation and job termination. Decisional conflict can exacerbate stress among this group of
vulnerable workers, which can lead to lower job retention rates and chronic health issues. The objective of this
proposal is to develop a workplace web-based, interactive decision aid, focused on giving employed parents of
children with MHD knowledge and a process to reduce decisional conflict caused by contextual factors through (a)
structured feedback on whether, what and when to disclose their disability-related care demands to their supervisor
based on knowledge of risks, benefits and priority-setting activities that provides individualized feedback on disclosure
preferences, and (b) resources supporting the highest ranked priority. Aim 1 will identify 4-5 contextual factors related
to decisional conflict. Aim 2 develops a workplace web-based employee disclosure decision aid prototype, resources
that incorporate organizational and managerial factors in the design. Aim 3 will pilot a web-based workplace employee
disclosure decision aid and resources in a before-after study that will assess whether using the aid and resources
reduces decisional conflict and stress among employees. The expected outcome of accomplishing the proposed
objective is to develop a framework for, and prototype of, an individual level intervention for workers that will be paired
with an organizational level intervention that targets leadership support to promote the health and well-being of
vulnerable workers. This project is innovative, because develops and tests a workplace web application decision aid,
and provides educational resources to parents of children with MHD, a group of workers whose needs are unmet by
current occupational safety and health programs. The project aligns with Objective 7 of the National Occupational
Research Agenda as it seeks to promote worker health and safety by conducting high impact workplace interventions
that reduce worker illness and increase health and well-being by promoting a sustainable work-nonwork interface."

 Submucous cleft palate (SMCP), defined by abnormal attachment of palatal muscles with intact oral and
nasal mucosa, is a common craniofacial birth defect that disrupts the essential function of the soft palate for
swallowing, causing feeding difficulties, middle ear dysfunction leading to hearing loss, and lifetime speech
problems. Humans have five pairs of palatal muscles that all attach to the palatine aponeurosis, a fan-like
dense fibrous connective tissue comprising the core of the soft palate that connects to the hard palate bone.
Whereas the palatal muscles are derived from embryonic pharyngeal mesoderm, all connective tissues in the
soft palate, including the palatine aponeurosis, tendons, and the muscle connective tissues that are
embedded within and ensheathing the muscles, develop from cranial neural crest cell (CNCC) derived
mesenchyme. Studies of limb muscle development have identified the embryonic muscle connective tissue
as an important source of signals for patterning both the nascent muscles and tendons. However, how muscle
connective tissue and tendon cells are specified from a common mesenchymal progenitor population and
how they regulate muscle and tendon development remain unclear. We found that the Foxf2 and Foxd1
transcription factors exhibit complementary and partly overlapping patterns of expression along the medial-
lateral axis of the embryonic soft palate mesenchyme at the onset of palatal myogenesis, with Foxf2
expression enriched in medial mesenchymal progenitors and with Foxd1 strongly expressed in the
mesenchyme cells in the muscle-forming lateral region of the embryonic soft palate in mice. We demonstrate
that Foxf2-deficient mice exhibit specific soft palate defects, including mispositioned palatal muscles and
failure of palatine aponeurosis formation. Expression of Foxd1 and muscle-associating mesenchyme markers
are ectopically activated in the medial mesenchymal progenitor cells in Foxf2 mutant embryonic soft palate.
Furthermore, Foxd1 heterozygosity substantially rescues palatine aponeurosis formation and integration with
the tensor veli palatini (TVP) muscles in Foxf2 mutant mice. On the other hand, homozygous disruption of
Foxd1 causes aberrant splitting and abnormal attachment of TVP muscles to the pterygoid plate. Our central
hypothesis is that Foxf2 and Foxd1 act antagonistically to regulate the specification and differentiation of
distinct connective tissue lineages from the CNCC-derived soft palate mesenchyme to guide the
morphogenesis and integration of palatal muscles. We propose comprehensive experimental studies to gain
unprecedented understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating soft palate connective
tissue development and palatal muscle morphogenesis. Data from these studies provide a rich resource for
uncovering mechanisms coordinating development and integration of musculoskeletal tissues and will lead
to improvement in diagnosis and treatment of SMCP and other musculoskeletal disorders."

In a murine model, neonatal morphine exposure (NME) results in prolonged pain hypersensitivity in
adolescence and adulthood; however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In adults, morphine
exposure has been found to alter the gut microbiome leading to gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis has been
associated with microglial activation and neuroinflammation, which are critical in the initiation and persistence
of several pathological pain states. Activation of the microglia in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) and
spinal cord has been found to be heavily implicated in the development of the opioid-induced hypersensitivity
to pain. I recently showed that NME resulted in long-term gut dysbiosis persisting in adolescence and into
adulthood. However, the role of the gut microbiome, in particular NME-induced gut dysbiosis, have not yet
been investigated in prolonged pain hypersensitivity following NME. Therefore, the goal in this study is to
investigate the role of the gut microbiome in driving prolonged hypersensitivity to pain following NME. The
overarching hypothesis is that NME results in prolonged pain hypersensitivity by inducing long-lasting
alterations to the gut microbiome and driving persistent neuroinflammation in the microglia. To test this
hypothesis, in specific aim 1, the causal role of the gut microbiome in driving prolonged hypersensitivity to pain
will be investigated using Fecal Microbial Transplantation (FMT) of a dysbiotic microbiome from NME-mice
(donor) into naïve age-matched mice (recipient) to test whether an NME-microbiome alone results in pain
hypersensitivity. Furthermore, probiotics will be administered during the NME period to rescue the NME-
induced dysbiosis and to investigate whether a probiotic intervention can attenuate pain hypersensitivity
following NME. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, aim 2 will seek to establish that NME-
induced dysbiosis modulates microglial activation in regions that are essential for the processing and
modulation of pain, in particular the PAG and spinal cord, which drives pain hyper-sensitivity. Thus, using
immunohistochemistry, the activation status of the microglia in the PAG and spinal cord of NME-off springs will
be assessed. Additionally, the levels of released pro-inflammatory and nociceptive markers will be assessed
using RT-qPCR for mRNA determination and a Multiplex bead array for protein determination. Tissues from
the mice with manipulated microbiome generated in aim 1 will also be investigated to implicate the gut
microbiome. Finally, to further establish the involvement of the microglia on prolonged pain hypersensitivity, the
microglia of NME-off springs will be depleted during adolescence and adulthood with the CSF1R antagonist,
(PLX) 5622. Pain sensitivity will be tested following the short-term microglial depletion. Overall, this study will
advance our current understanding of the mechanisms driving hypersensitivity to pain following NME. The
results from these studies will be used to develop therapeutic strategies such as early life probiotic therapy to
mitigate long-term consequences of early opioid exposure."

Malaysia's HIV epidemic is rapidly expanding, with recent evidence suggesting increasing sexual transmission,
especially in MSM. HIV prevalence among MSM is now at an all-time high of 21.6% and is concentrated in the
country's capital, Kuala Lumpur, where prevalence among MSM is 43% in 2020, up from 22% just four years
before. Insights into Malaysia's expanding HIV epidemic are multi-factorial: Both homosexuality and substance
use are criminalized in Malaysia. MSM are, therefore, often hesitant to disclose their sexuality or risk behaviors,
primarily due to fear of stigma, discrimination, or criminalization. Further, evidence suggests the widespread
use (24%) of psychoactive substances (e.g., amphetamine-type stimulants) before or during a sexual encounter,
also known as sexualized drug use (chemsex) among Malaysian MSM, which leads to high-risk sexual practices
(e.g., condomless sex). Stigma and discrimination are also enacted on MSM by healthcare providers, which foster
a hostile environment toward MSM, complicating efforts to scale-up of HIV testing and subsequent linkage to
HIV prevention (pre-exposure prophylaxis) and treatment (antiretroviral therapy) services. HIV testing
jumpstarts entry into the HIV prevention and treatment cascades. New HIV testing guidelines recommend MSM
test every 3 to 6 months, as early HIV testing is a cost-effective strategy for stemming the HIV epidemic. Yet,
HIV testing rates remain low among Malaysian MSM: ever tested (70.3%) and last year tested (30.9%). HIV self-
testing (HIVST) may be particularly impactful among MSM in Malaysia. Although willingness to use HIVST is
high in this group, its use is still minimal due to lack of access to HIVST kits, concerns related to misinterpreting
results, and missed opportunities for counseling and linkage to care. In this context, eHealth represents an
innovative platform to transform the face of HIV service delivery (i.e., testing and linkage to care). Leveraging
eHealth platforms for HIV services delivery in Malaysia is ideal given that nearly all (>99%) MSM use some form
of communication technology (e.g., smartphone, laptop) and has a strong preference for web-based platforms
for HIVST. Therefore, we developed and pilot-tested a web-based HIVST platform, called Jom-Test®, to promote
HIV testing by providing free anonymous HIVST. The results demonstrated high feasibility and acceptability for
the platform but low post-test linkage to treatment and prevention services. The findings further indicated the
need for real-time (online) access to counselors for pre- and post-test counseling and support for linkage to HIV
and chemsex-related harm reduction services (offline). To address this evidence gap, we propose to jump-start
the broader HIV care continuum by adapting, expanding, and refining an existing Jom-Test® platform. The
enhanced version, to be called Jom-TestPlus, will include real-time e-counseling (eHIVST) with integrated O2O
linkage to HIV prevention and treatment services while simultaneously co-addressing chemsex-related needs for
Malaysian MSM. This model represents a potentially impactful strategy for reaching marginalized populations,
like MSM, and allows immediate engagement in the post-test linkage process to prevention or treatment services."

The Psychosis: A Convergent Neuroscience Perspective training grant aims to provide basic and clinical
neuroscientists with skills and experiences necessary to launch an interdisciplinary research career that can
contribute to mechanistic understanding of psychosis spectrum disorders. This revised renewal application
capitalizes on the depth of resources, facilities and faculty dedicated to research and training in translational
neuroscience at Penn. The program forges cross-fertilization of clinical neuroscientists, with expertise in
psychosis spectrum disorders, and basic neuroscientists, with new methodologies to probe neural mechanisms
pertinent to psychosis. Training will be provided in four Units, reflecting concentrations of investigators and
laboratories and state of the field: (1) Brain Phenotypes; (2) Neurogenetics; (3) Cellular and Molecular; (4)
Computation. While each trainee will work primarily within a Unit, with a mentor supervising the research
training, there will be common courses and workshops across Units. The didactic experiences will be
coordinated by faculty to assure training in informatics, biostatistics and methodology, ethical conduct of
research and a solid grounding in behavioral phenotyping. The 5-year post-doctoral program will have five
trainees with M.D., M.D./Ph.D. and Ph.D. degrees, each trained for a period of 2-years. The program
capitalizes on extensive experience of the participating laboratories, which have joint grants, training programs,
seminars, and enjoy a productive collaboration in all academic activities. The training program dovetails with
the academic agenda of the Schizophrenia Research Center, where faculty interact by working collaboratively
in research teams in ways that can serve as role models for trainees. We hope that our efforts will continue to
help advance the careers of high quality clinical and basic neuroscientists who can move the field ahead
collaboratively. Through active participation in research, combined with didactic course work and workshops,
trainees learn to conduct research bridging clinical with basic neurosciences relevant to understanding the
neurobiology of psychosis spectrum disorders. The Training Committee, which includes the scientific leaders of
the Training Units, assists the Program Director and Associate Directors in coordinating recruitment and
admissions, assuring appropriate matching of Fellows to mentors and research laboratories, and monitoring
quality and progress of training. Responsible conduct of research, data reproducibility, and professionalism are
highly emphasized as is diversity, with an Internal Diversity Advisory Board. The program is guided by an
External Advisory Board Research projects of trainees span the scope of the participating laboratories with a
focus on neurobiology of psychosis. Notably, the proposed program is the only one at Penn emphasizing the
training of clinical and basic neuroscientists in the study of complex behavior and psychosis. It contributes the

The overall goal of this research is to develop and translate effective neurostimulation-based therapies to
facilitate neurologic recovery for patients with chronic, persistent deficits secondary to acquired brain injury.
Despite progress in acute intervention strategies, traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a leading cause of long-
term disability in the United States and there is an on-going need for novel approaches to facilitate recovery and
rehabilitation for survivors. Our group has shown previously that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the lateral
cerebellar nucleus (LCN), the origin of the ascending dentatothalamocortical (DTC) pathway with widespread
influence (via thalamus) across frontal and parietal cortical regions as well as to the basal ganglia, enhances
motor rehabilitation in a chronic rodent model of middle cerebral artery ischemia. Therapeutic gains were
associated with changes in perilesional cerebral cortical excitability, enhanced cerebral cortical reorganization,
and evidence of increased synaptogenesis in perilesional cortex. Here, we will evaluate whether therapeutic
benefit can be similarly realized for persistent motor and cognitive deficits following TBI, using a controlled
cortical impact (CCI) model in rodents. Moreover, we will further characterize the LCN DBS-induced physiological
and cellular changes that occur across perilesional cortical regions. In addition to the supporting evidence
afforded by our prior work in rodent models of middle cerebral artery ischemia and our early results from human
translation of that work, we provide preliminary evidence of behavioral efficacy and underlying physiological
mechanisms in two treatment models: rats with induced motor deficits following fluid percussion injury (FPI) TBI
over sensorimotor cortex as well as animals that showed cognitive deficits following bi-frontal CCI targeting
medial prefrontal cortical regions. In the current proposal, our specific aims are 1) to confirm and extend our
preliminary findings regarding LCN DBS' effects on post-TBI motor recovery, 2) to evaluate the potential LCN
DBS to improve post-TBI cognitive function, 3) to characterize the nature of LCN DBS-mediated perilesional and
DTC pathway reorganization post-CCI injury; and 4) to examine the cellular and molecular changes in
perilesional cortical regions associated with LCN DBS. This study will provide preclinical evidence and support
for future translational efforts of this novel therapeutic approach to enhancing chronic, post-TBI deficits."

Behavior is motivated by reward, and the most powerful rewards are those that satisfy a physiologic need. For
decades, neuroscientists have studied the midbrain dopamine system to understand reward and hypothalamic
circuits to understand sensing of internal needs. But how these two neural systems are interact to give rise to
behaviors like eating and drinking remains poorly understood. Recently, we have used approaches for
simultaneous neural recording and manipulation to observe directly the communication between these two
systems. We have also mapped the signals they each receive from the gut in response to ingestion of food and
fluids. This has revealed that hunger and thirst powerfully modulate the dopamine system, but do so in different
ways and likely involve distinct circuit mechanisms. We propose here to build on these findings to
systematically delineate how these neural circuits for need and reward interact in the brain. In Aim 1, we
investigate how these circuits represent internal needs, by recording their dynamics at multiple levels of
analysis under different physiologic states, and further measuring how those dynamics are influenced by
targeted circuit manipulations. In Aim 2, we investigate how these circuits use information about bodily needs
to drive learning about food, by monitoring and manipulating their activity during the learning process. In Aim 3,
we investigate how these circuits use information about internal state to drive motivation, by monitoring and
manipulating their activity during tasks where animals must evaluate competing needs and rewards. These
studies will provide fundamental insight into the mechanisms by which information about body needs is utilized
by the brain to generate learning and motivation."

 The long-term objective of the research proposed here is to establish a novel method for
creating vaccines. These vaccines will lead to a highly focused antibody response toward
particular epitopes that are known to be the targets of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs). If successful, this approach could be applied broadly for the creation of important, new
vaccines that protect against infectious disease.
 The ability to focus the antibody response toward particular epitopes would permit
vaccines to be created that elicit neutralizing antibodies, instead of non-neutralizing antibodies.
It would also permit creation of vaccines that lead to an antibody response directed against
highly conserved regions of an infectious agent, leading to broad spectrum protection against
different strains and minimizing the possibility of “escape” by mutant variants.
 The key starting material for the approach is a mAb that is broadly neutralizing against
the infectious agent. In recent decades, many potent, broadly neutralizing mAbs (bnAbs) have
been isolated and characterized in detail. Some of these bnAbs (for example, that target
influenza virus, Ebola virus and HIV-1) have entered clinical trials to test their efficacy in treating
infectious disease and/or to determine whether passively infused mAb can prevent infection.
Despite major research funding, however, it has generally not been possible to create vaccines
that are capable of eliciting antibodies with properties such as these bnAbs.
 Here, a simple but radically different approach for creating epitope-focused vaccine
candidates is utilized that leverages a tool that has been available all along – the mAb itself.
First, binding of the mAb is used to protect the target epitope. Next the surface of the remainder
of the antigen is modified to render it non-immunogenic. Finally, the protecting mAb is removed,
thereby deprotecting and exposing the unmodified, target epitope. The method is called protect,
modify, deprotect (or PMD). Ultimately, this high-risk, high-reward proposal could enable
creation of vaccines that elicit an antibody response against any given mAb epitope, and only
that epitope."

Black women experience stark disparities in pregnancy care, complications, and outcomes, compared to White
women. Recognizing, tracking and understanding patterns of severe maternal mortality (SMM) and associated
inequities by race/ethnicity, along with developing and carrying out interventions to improve the quality of
maternal care, are essential to reducing SMM and thereby maternal mortality. To date, there has been little
research specifically aimed at understanding whether the maternal health inequities as experienced by Black
women can be ameliorated through an integrated care model that includes engagement of mothers of color in
the planning and implementation of maternal safety bundles in addition to prenatal, birth and postpartum
support from community doulas. We intend to use the Health Impact Pyramid to develop, implement and
assess the effectiveness of such a system in reducing disparities in SMM and mortality. The data sources for
this study will include state-level and hospital-specific discharge data collected as part of the Alliance for
Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM) project; the Maternal Mortality Review Committee (MMRC); and the
Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal (PELL) data system, which focuses on population-level data needed to
examine health inequities among racial and ethnic minorities in Massachusetts. In addition to these existing
data sources, we intend to establish a data collection tool to assess doula services as well as analyze
qualitative data from interviews with black women, and focus groups with providers and doulas to explore the
effect of incorporating doula-provided services into prenatal, birth and postpartum care. This proposal has
three main study areas that will lead to a systematic understanding of ways to address and prevent SMM
among black women and thus, establish a foundation for the development, testing and scale-up of future
interventions to improve maternal health outcomes: 1) Use longitudinally linked hospital discharge data from
PELL (2008-2018) to characterize preconception, prenatal and postpartum hospital encounters among women
with SMM in order to identify key points where opportunities to intervene were missed. 2): Among hospitals
that serve black women, to assess the impact of implementing maternal safety bundles to ensure that black
women are receiving quality obstetric care 3): Examine how systems integrating community-based doula
support could decrease the inequities of SMM among black and white mothers. Our study will lead to a more
systematic understanding of pregnancy outcomes for Black women at highest risk of SMM, thus establishing a
foundation for development and testing of future interventions to improve maternal outcomes."

The long-term goal of this laboratory is reveal the structure of the hair cell's mechanosensitive organelle, the
hair bundle, and to determine how structural features of the bundle are responsible for its
mechanotransduction function. In this proposal, we focus on the under-appreciated process of actin-core
widening, which occurs in stereocilia during development of the bundle. We utilize inner hair cells of the mouse
cochlea as our model system; not only do their stereocilia rows show unique diameters and lengths, but all of
the tools we deploy in studying bundle function can be deployed with these cells. In Aim 1, we will extend our
cryo-electron tomography program to developing inner hair cells, asking specifically when and where
peripheral actin filaments are added to the actin core during the widening process. In Aim 2, we will isolate
inner hair cells marked with GFP using Fgf8-Gfp;Atoh1-Cre mice, and then subject them to protein mass
spectrometry. In conjunction with our collaborators at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, we have
defined the proteomes of single inner hair cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. While we will not
analyze single cells in the present project, we will exploit the sensitivity of the new techniques to analyze small
pools of cells isolated from a specific region of the cochlea at precise development times. In addition, we will
isolate inner hair cell stereocilia at the same time points using pipette aspiration, allowing us to also determine
the stereocilia proteome over development. By comparing the whole-cell and stereocilia proteomics data, we
will track when each protein enters stereocilia, and mine these data to identify new candidates for complexes
that control stereocilia widening. Finally, in Aim 3, we will study three mutant mouse lines (Espn, Capzb,
Grxcr1) that have thin stereocilia, using the techniques developed for Aims 1 and 2 to characterize the
structural and temporal features of stereocilia. Together, the experiments developed in this project will allow us
to determine how the hair cell widens its stereocilia, which is one of the critical steps in development of the hair
bundle."

Microcirculation in retinal capillaries plays a critical role in support of the intense metabolic activities of the
inner retina and for maintaining normal retinal function in the human eye. The delivery oxygen and removal of
metabolic waste at the tissue level is largely accomplished by erythrocytes that compress and flow in single file
through retinal capillaries. Within single capillaries, the erythrocytes are accelerated periodically by the
hemodynamic force and impeded by flow resistance. Meanwhile, the capillaries endure stress (shear and
circumferential) resulting from the blood flow. Biological responses to the hemodynamic forces in the capillary-
blood complex play an important role in blood flow control and vessel structural remodeling. While pulsatile
movement of erythrocytes in the blood vessel is essential for oxygen transfer and critical for capillary function
and tissue health, excess pressure and flow pulsatility can harm capillaries and result in target organ damage
Disruption of normal pulsatility has been implicated in ocular, systemic and central nervous system (CNS)
pathologies. Thus, in vivo characterization of the pulsatile movement of the erythrocytes in human retinal
capillaries is significant for understanding retinal, systemic and CNS pathophysiology and facilitating the
development of novel treatments. We have developed a novel adaptive optics near-confocal ophthalmoscope
(AONCO) which enables precise measurement of the pulsatile erythrocyte velocity within a cardiac cycle in the
finest human retinal capillaries. This ability allows for evaluating high order dynamics pertaining to the
acceleration of the erythrocytes that reflects the time varying hemodynamic forces, and informs the mechanical
strass endured by the capillary system. We hypothesize that high-order hemodynamic characteristics are
fundamental measures of retinal capillary function and can be sensitive biomarkers for detecting small or early
changes in capillary pathophysiology. We thus propose to investigate the high-order dynamics of the
erythrocyte flow at the single capillary level in the maculae of living human subjects who are in normal physical
and ocular health and in patients with hypertension and diabetes, using the AONCO. Our objectives are two-
fold: better understanding high order hemodynamics in human retinal capillaries and developing new
biomarkers for detecting age- and disease-related changes in retinal microcirculation. To achieve these goals,
first, we will investigate the spatial and temporal variation of high order hemodynamics and characterize the
influence of gender, age, and race/ethnicity in healthy human subjects. Then, we will evaluate the impact of
hypertension. Finally, we will examine retinal capillary hemodynamics in diabetic patients at increasing risk for
developing retinopathy. Our study investigates a novel method for assessing retinal capillary function. The
outcome will have high impact on broad field relating to systemic can CNS conditions. It may facilitate the
development of novel treatment strategies by providing precise assessment of the therapeutic efficacy."

Low-income Hispanic adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) experience a disproportionate burden of life-threatening,
acute complications, both hypoglycemia and diabetes ketoacidosis, with high rates of related emergency
department visits, hospitalizations, and death. Use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) may mitigate these
inequities. Yet, Hispanics with T1D have exceptionally low levels of CGM use. This reflects social determinants
of health (SODH), as framed by the multiple levels of the Socio-Ecological Model (SEM). The SEM’s healthcare
provider level is a main driver in Hispanic disenfranchisement from CGM. With a severe shortage of
endocrinologists, primary care providers are increasingly managing T1D although a high majority report
inadequate confidence in titrating insulin and using CGM. With limited access to endocrinology, low-income,
Hispanic adults with T1D thus often receive diabetes management in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs)
with scant or no access to CGM. Hence, to foster equitable uptake of CGM in the most vulnerable Hispanic
adults with T1D, a 4-year, mixed-methods, feasibility study with a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) is
proposed to primarily assess the feasibility of the SEM-guided intervention (targeting the individual, family/social
networks, and healthcare provider levels). The individual level of the intervention fosters essential acquisition of
information, motivation, and behavioral skills for CGM uptake through two approaches: (1) 4-week, personalized,
CGM sessions with a RN certified in diabetes education; and (2) followed by peer education visits between data
collection points. The family/social networks level leverages the core Hispanic values of familismo and
collectivismo to promote critical support in CGM uptake with a family member co-attending the 4-week sessions
and participant engagement with a peer educator during scheduled visits, respectively. The provider level of the
intervention is designed to promote enhanced cultural competency in intervention delivery and provide clinical
support for CGM informed by rigorous training in T1D management and CGM via Project ECHO. In study phase
1 (Aim 1), the intervention, informed by stakeholder qualitative findings, will be refined and RCT deployment will
be planned with 4 FQHC sites randomized to deliver the intervention (n=2) or control (n=2) conditions with a total
enrollment goal of 30 Hispanics with T1D (sites having roughly equivalent enrollment rates). Project ECHO: CGM
& T1D Care will also be delivered to intervention site providers. In phase 2 (Aim 2), the feasibility of the study
protocol (e.g., recruitment and retention yields, data collection procedures, intervention implementation, and
intervention acceptability, among others) will be routinely assessed. In phase 2 (Aim 3), significant intervention
signals in terms of physiological (e.g., A1C and time within, above, and below range), psychosocial (e.g., quality
of life, family support, physician trust), and behavioral (CGM adherence) outcomes from baseline to 3- and 6-
months postbaseline will be assessed. The long-term goal of this study is to inform a large, multi-site RCT, and
with successful results, provide a model for CGM uptake in Hispanic adults with T1D for FQHCs nationally"

The UC Davis R25 program seeks to contribute to the improved care of patients with neurological disease by
training neurology and neurosurgery residents to be clinician-scientists able to develop new treatments for
nervous system disorders and to attract individual career research funding. Historically, UC Davis has had a
strong commitment to neuroscience, excellent departments of neurology and neurological surgery, and several
renowned centers of excellence, including the Center for Neuroscience, Center for Mind & Brain, and the MIND
Institute. However, the clinical neuroscience training programs have lacked the resources to take full advantage
of this remarkable neuroscience research environment. The proposed R25 program will capitalize on these
institutional strengths to enable a resident research training program with the following features:
  A uniquely diverse faculty in two highly integrated and coordinated clinical neuroscience departments;
  Direction by two clinician scientists highly experienced in resident training and research mentorship;
  A program with high impact research training within the usual period of residency and fellowship, thus
 avoiding extending the duration of training for clinician scientists choosing an academic track;
  Mentoring of each participant by a pair of faculty members who have received special training in research
 and career mentorship;
  Emphasis on participation by women and under-represented minorities;
  A curriculum that takes advantage of a unique set of educational resources available at UC Davis through
 the Clinical Translational Science Center which is supported by the NIH CTSA program;
  A highly fertile neuroscience environment with vast expertise among the faculty, enormous resources
 and a legacy of accomplishment;
  Funding and other resources contributed by the university, school of medicine, and departments
 specifically to support the resident training program;
The program will provide intensive training and mentoring in neuroscience research within redesigned training
programs for neurology and neurosurgery residents, particularly those whose potential is historically
underdeveloped. This program is distinguished by the strength in neuroscience of its faculty and institutions,
innovation in training program structures, and the uniqueness of its emphasis on diversity. It will fully exploit
UC Davis's tremendously strong Neuroscience community as its training environment. And it will mine the
university's rich racial, socioeconomic, and gender diversity in identifying and training clinician neuroscientists
whose potential would otherwise go under-developed. Development of this potential will promote the nation's
health through their individual scientific discoveries and through the discoveries of those of similar demographic
features for whom they will serve as role models."

due in part to historical data showing that BAA women undergo more hysterectomies compared to other
populations, even when fertility preservation is a stated goal of patient care.
The benefits of early detection and treatment are myriad. Yet, such benefits go unrealized if women and girls
do not recognize the signs and symptoms of fibroids and communicate with health care teams to receive useful
information and self-care tools.
This proposal will use qualitative, community-based research to understand the experiences of women with
symptomatic fibroids. In turn, tactics will be developed using behavioral and social science research (BSSR)
methods—focused on increasing early awareness of signs and symptoms of fibroids—to increase knowledge
surrounding the range of treatment options.
Teams comprised of researchers at Mayo Clinic, the University of Florida, and the University of Mississippi
Medical Center will work together to engage patients in their local areas and develop culturally appropriate
education and dissemination."
10898403,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Multiple myeloma is the second most prevalent hematologic malignancy in the US with an estimated 7.1 cases
per 100,000. Patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma have improved survival with autologous stem cell
transplant (ASCT), however high symptom burden, including reduced muscle strength, is still highly prevalent
and results in worsened clinical outcomes due to progressive age-related comorbidities and frailty. Despite
advances in ACST, there are limited non-pharmacologic prehabilitative intervention strategies to augment
physical fitness through improved muscular strength and minimize the risk of unfavorable clinical outcomes.
Prehabilitation exercise-based programs do not exist in the current standard of care for ASCT in multiple
myeloma. Developing supportive individualized care interventions that target maximizing functional status would
be of great benefit to patients with multiple myeloma whose extended survival is heavily impacted by the chronic
burden of their cancer therapies.
The objectives of the proposed research sub-analysis of the ongoing PROTECT trial, designed with the primary
goal of assessing feasibility of exercise, are to examine the effects of an 8-week home-based, virtually supervised
prehabilitative exercise intervention on (1) muscle strength, (2) patient health outcomes including physical
capacity, patient reported outcomes, and cardiometabolic health outcomes, and (3) clinical outcomes in 30
patients with multiple myeloma undergoing ASCT being treated at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Our central
hypothesis is that muscle strength will be improved over the course of an 8-week prehabilitative exercise training
program in patients with multiple myeloma. We also hypothesize that exercise will improve patient health
outcomes and clinical outcomes. The impact of the proposed research lies in providing an effective pre-transplant
intervention that can improve muscle strength, patient health outcomes and postoperative clinical outcomes in
patients with multiple myeloma receiving ASCT. This sub-analysis will establish foundational knowledge to
conduct a larger-phase clinical trial to test clinical benefits of prehabilitation exercise in patients with multiple
myeloma undergoing ASCT.
The proposed F31 training fellowship aims to leverage my background in biology and exercise physiology for
investigating the effects of an exercise intervention in multiple myeloma patients. Through this fellowship, I aspire
to align my research efforts with my long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher
specializing in exercise physiology and cancer prevention/survivorship. The dedicated time and support will
establish strong mentorship and facilitate the acquisition of essential skills and knowledge necessary to make
significant contributions to the field of exercise oncology."

10902573,"PROJECT ABSTRACT. Medicaid expansion covers over 18 million low-income patients, including those
experiencing an intensive care unit (ICU) stay during serious illness. More than half of ICU survivors have new
or worsening problems with cognitive, physical, and mental health. Further, experiences of critical illness
create new health disparities and exacerbate existing ones. This study applies the NIMHD’s Research
Framework to understand how sociocultural environment, the built environment, and the health system
domains of influence at the patient, interpersonal and community-level, differentially shape ICU survivorship
among patients covered by Medicaid expansion. Such knowledge will enable state and federal policymakers
and clinicians to provide improved coordination of medical and social services for Medicaid members at the
greatest risk of poor health outcomes.
This work will leverage the resources of a well-established partnership between Virginia Medicaid and Virginia
Commonwealth University (VCU) and as well as complementary methods and data sources to better
understand how health determinants shape patients’ recovery after an ICU stay. Aim 1 assess how patient-
level and community-level sociocultural, built environment and health system domains are associated with
post-ICU hospital free days among Medicaid patients in Virginia using Virginia Medicaid claims data and
publicly available community level-data on social deprivation, segregation, rurality, ICU bed and primary care
access. Aim 2 uses qualitative research methods to expand beyond what is available in claims data by
interviewing 25 Medicaid patients to explore their perspectives on how health determinants shape their
experiences during and after ICU stays at VCU Health System, the largest safety net provider in Virginia. Aim
3 examine whether including health determinants improves machine learning models predicting hospital
readmissions after an ICU stay using electronic health record data from VCU Health System.
The proposed research is supported by Virginia Medicaid, aligning with the agency’s commitment to advancing
health equity through improving care for complex patients. Ultimately this work will provide much-needed
evidence to policymakers exploring disparities in recovery after serious illness across the sociocultural
environment, built environment and health system domains. This application describes an excellent research
and training environment for the proposed work, supported by a collaborative multi-disciplinary mentorship
team. This proposal will not only explore a novel research area, the recovery of Medicaid patients after serious
illness, but also provide integrated and robust clinical and research training in health-policy translation,
qualitative methods and community-engaged research and machine learning to a physician-scientist dedicated
to practicing critical care medicine and pursuing a faculty position with a focus on advancing health equity
through health policy."
10902910,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are transmembrane proteins with well-established roles
in neuronal physiology, including action potential initiation and propagation. Mutations in VGSCs
are associated with severe pediatric epilepsies. Despite the availability of VGSC-selective
pharmacotherapies, many patients do not achieve sufficient seizure control and no existing
treatment is effective for improving cognitive and behavioral impairments. Interestingly, VGSCs
are expressed early in the development of the nervous system before neurons are capable of
generating action potentials and before neuronal circuits have established. Certain variants in the
predominant developmental VGSC gene SCN3A are associated with severe cortical
malformations and Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy (DEE). Furthermore, studies of
VGSC functions in non-excitable cells have identified under-appreciated yet important functions
in a variety of cellular processes termed “non-canonical” functions, including regulation of Na+
homeostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and migration. Together these findings suggest that
VGSCs perform different roles in early development than in the mature brain. I hypothesize that
a greater understanding of these functions in VGSC-DEE will be important for developing effective
treatments. Here, I will use an innovative human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived
brain organoids carrying clinically relevant mutations in SCN3A and isogenic controls. Preliminary
studies have found irregularities in the patterning and morphology of SCN3A mutant cerebral
organoids and we have found that pharmacologic inhibition of VGSCs disrupts interneuron
migration in control hiPSC-derived cerebral organoids. While this data demonstrates
recapitulation of key clinical phenotypes in the cellular model, the mechanisms governing these
effects remains unclear. I propose to study non-canonical cellular functions in the following aims:
Aim 1 will examine the influence of SCN3A on cellular migration in the developing brain. Aim 2
will identify the molecular mechanisms by which SCN3A influences cellular processes of brain
development using single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to identify transcriptional differences
between control, SCN3A, and pharmacologically-treated organoids. Aim 3 will investigate the
therapeutic potential of corrective gene engineering. I will design and test a precise gene editing
approach to correct pathogenic SCN3A variants in human cerebral organoids. This proposed
project highlights the need for a paradigm-shift in thinking about the role of VGSCs in brain
development and new therapeutic strategies targeting diverse cellular functions of VGSCs."

 Efferocytosis - the engulfment of dying cells is an essential regulatory process. It can either inhibit or promote
self-immunization, inflammation and the release of viral or tumor DNA. Efferocytosis is a collective cellular
event done by either professional phagocytes or by the surrounding tissue cells. The earlier view of apoptosis
as a universally anti-inflammatory process has changed. It is now divided into the immunogenic and the
tolerogenic (non-inflammatory) forms based the engulfment process. Therefore it became essential to have a
broad-spectrum technology which could detect and quantify efferocytic processing in all participating cell types,
However, currently there is no such assay. In this project we set out to overcome this limitation.
 This project will introduce a principally new technology detecting efferocytosis in tissue sections and in live
cells. Our method isolates the unique enzymatic activity, present only transiently in the catalytic cycle of
topoisomerases, and uses it as a basis for the new type of molecular labeling. The assay will use catalytic
intermediates of the topoisomerization reaction as novel fluorescent probes. These FRET probes are capable
of detecting and quantifying the essential marker of efferocytosis, nucleolytic activity of DNase II digesting DNA
of apoptotic cells. The technology will selectively label and quantify apoptotic DNA disassembly in
efferosomes, i.e. phagolysosomes of the cells that engulfed apoptotic nuclei. The new method will permit
highly specific detection and the near instantaneous FRET quantification of efferocytic and phagocytic
reactions in live and fixed cells and tissues.
The proposal will reach these Specific Aims:
1. To develop the first in situ assay using catalytic intermediates of topoisomerization reaction as novel
fluorescent probes detecting and quantifying efferocytosis in the tissue section format. To optimize specificity,
sensitivity and reproducibility of the assay using in vitro and in situ models. To validate the new method in
several models of efferocytic clearance using tissue sections.
2. To develop the first FRET assay technology using catalytic intermediates of topoisomerization reaction as
novel FRET probes for labeling and quantification of efferocytosis in live cells at the level of individual cells. To
optimize specificity, sensitivity and quantitative ability of the assay using in vitro, in situ models, and live cells.
To validate the new FRET method in several models of efferocytic clearance using cultured cells.
3. To enable the subcellular assessment of efferocytosis efficiency by radically increasing sensitivity of the
technology with help of novel advanced fluorescent tags - Ndots. To optimize the assay to achieve single
molecule resolution in assessing its molecular targets and in broad range signal quantification. To finalize
development of the technology by validating its quantification capacity in several models combining apoptosis
and its efferocytic clearance."
11115543,"Background: Long-term use of benzodiazepine medication has been increasing sharply inside
and outside of VA, raising the risk of cognitive decline, falls, and overdose among patients. A
self-directed benzodiazepine tapering intervention known as EMPOWER was shown effective in
a non-VA clinical trial, and within VA there is significant interest in tailoring it to and providing it
for Veterans. Significance: Although often useful as short-term medications, when taken for
extended periods benzodiazepines carry risk of cognitive decline and other brain damage, falls
and other accidents, benzodiazepine dependence and opioid-benzodiazepine overdose (VA
Pharmacy Benefits Management Academic Detailing Service, 2017). This is major concern
within VA, which prescribes benzodiazepines to over 350,000 Veterans a year, 2/3 of whom
take them long-term (i.e., 3 months or more) (VA Pharmacy Benefits Management Academic
Detailing Service, 2017). Innovation: Because the EMPOWER intervention was paper-and-
pencil based, it would be useful to convert it to an electronic version that worked on smart
phones, tablets, and/or desktop computers. Accordingly, the proposed project intends to convert
EMPOWER to electronic format and to tailor it to the needs and preferences of the Veteran
population. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Tailor a promising non-VA benzodiazepine cessation
intervention (EMPOWER) to Veterans and simultaneously convert it from paper-and-pencil to
electronic format. Aim 2: Conduct a randomized clinical trial of the effectiveness of the tailored,
electronic intervention (EMPOWER-ED) on VA primary care patients’ benzodiazepine
cessation/reduction and functional outcomes. Aim 3: Conduct a budget impact analysis to
estimate the costs of implementing the EMPOWER-ED throughout VA. Methodology: This
conversion and tailoring will be an iterative process that the project team will conduct via focus
groups comprising Veterans, VA primary care providers, and VA operational partners. When the
revised intervention, called EMPOWER-ED (for EMPOWER “Electronically Delivered”), is fully
designed and has been successfully beta-tested by Veterans, its effectiveness will be evaluated
in a randomized clinical trial with 170 Veterans who have been on benzodiazepines for at least
3 months. The primary hypothesis of the study is that those receiving EMPOWER-ED will be
significantly more likely than controls to cease benzodiazepines entirely, and, to reduce their
dose by at least 25%, at 6-month follow-up. The secondary hypothesis is that Veterans
receiving EMPOWER-ED will also experience fewer anxiety symptoms, better sleep quality, and
overall health/quality of life at 6-month follow-up. A supplemental analysis of benzodiazepine
use only will be conducted using VA databases at 12 months to evaluate whether changes
identified at 6 months persist over time. The VA operational partners of the project team
(Pharmacy Benefits Management, Psychotropic Drug Safety Initiative, and Office of Connected
Care) are committed to disseminating EMPOWER-ED if it proves successful. Therefore, a third
aim of the study is to undertake a budget impact analysis to determine what the costs would be
to implement EMPOWER-ED in the VA systemwide. Next Steps/Implementation: Because
electronically-delivered interventions are inexpensive to disseminate once they have been
developed, this project has an excellent chance to promote health care value by creating an
easily scaled-up, method of reducing the prevalence of a widespread risk to Veterans’ health."

Research Project: Many mechanisms of intercellular communications in tissue depend on the physical proximity
between cells. Spatial barcoding-based transcriptomic data provide important and essential information to
understand intercellular communications in intact tissue by measuring transcriptomic data and spatial locations
of cells simultaneously. However, analysis of these data to understand intercellular communications faces the
following challenges. First, spatial barcoding-based transcriptomic data lacks single-cell resolution, and cell type
deconvolution is needed to infer cell-cell communication networks (CCCNs). Second, it is critical but challenging
to integrate spatial information with prior knowledge of ligand-receptor interactions and downstream regulated
genes for CCCN inference. Finally, difference in the distribution of CCCNs between disease and control groups
needs to be assessed to identify disease associated CCCN perturbations. Current methods are not able to
account for spatial correlation of cell type compositions between neighboring cells in cell type deconvolution nor
to integrate prior knowledge of ligand-receptor pairs and downstream regulated genes in CCCN inference. There
is no existing method developed to compare CCCNs between two groups of subjects. The goal of this application
is to develop accurate, robust, and efficient bioinformatic and computational tools to deconvolve spatial
barcoding-based transcriptomic data, infer CCCNs using spatial transcriptomic data, and assess differences in
CCCNs between two groups of subjects. Our long-term objective is to identify disease associated intercellular
communication changes from spatial transcriptomic data beyond what has been discovered by investigating
individual cell types or cells. To achieve this goal, we propose to 1) develop a graph Laplacian regularized model
to deconvolve spatial barcoding-based transcriptomic data using scRNA-seq data from same tissue type with
integration of spatial information; 2) develop a regularized graph attention network model to infer CCCNs by
integrating spatial information, prior knowledge of ligand-receptor pairs and corresponding downstream
regulated genes; and 3) develop a graphical generative model that compares CCCNs between disease and
control samples to identify disease associated perturbations in intercellular communications.
Research design and methods: Drs. Xiting Yan and Zuoheng Wang will jointly lead the proposed research
together with collaborator Dr. Naftali Kaminski, a team of experienced, committed experts in the fields of
bioinformatics, statistics, genomics and genetics, biology, translational research and precision medicine.
Regularized graph learning models will be developed. The datasets for our main study populations will come
primarily from Dr. Kaminski’s lab, which will also execute discovery validations and downstream functional
studies. R and python packages will be developed and freely distributed as open-source software in a light
weight, portable and self-sufficient way using containers."
11115541,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent and debilitating mental health
disorder that is independently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease
and hypertension. Given the large numbers of post-9/11 Veterans afflicted with PTSD,
addressing this under-recognized but highly significant consequence of PTSD is of paramount
importance to protect the future health of these young Veterans. We have shown that
post-9/11 Veterans with PTSD have overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS)
during mental stress and impaired arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) that could contribute to
the pathogenesis of hypertension and CV disease in these patients. While we have now
established that central sympathetic output is augmented in PTSD, the downstream effects of
SNS output on blood pressure (BP) regulation in PTSD remain unknown and is a major goal of
this proposal. We hypothesize that augmented sympathetic nerve activity in PTSD leads to
augmented SNS-mediated vasoconstriction within the kidney, an organ with a critical role in BP
regulation. Exaggerated increases in sympathetically mediated renal vasoconstriction could
perpetuate sustained increases in BP over time via renal sodium reabsorption and activation of
the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). To test this hypothesis, we will measure renal blood flow
velocity using Doppler ultrasound, continuous hemodynamics, muscle sympathetic nerve
activity (MSNA) using microneurography, plasma renin activity and inflammatory biomarkers at
rest and during mental stress in post 9/11 Veterans and matched controls. We further
hypothesize that SNS activation leads to an exaggerated vasoconstrictive response (i.e.
heightened neurovascular transduction of SNS activity) mediated by abnormal vascular
adrenergic receptor sensitivity in PTSD. To test this hypothesis, we will determine vascular
alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (α1AR) sensitivity by measuring vasoconstriction in response to
exponentially increasing doses of the selective α1AR agonist phenylephrine using a linear
variable differential transformer in PTSD and controls. Finally, prior studies have shown that
transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) reduces SNS activity, improves BRS, and
lowers inflammation in healthy humans and a number of chronic diseases; however, the
potential benefits of tVNS on SNS function and regulation in PTSD have never previously been
investigated. We hypothesize that tVNS acutely lowers SNS activity and improves sympathetic
and cardiovagal BRS in PTSD. To test this hypothesis, we will measure MSNA, EKG,
hemodynamics, inflammation, and BRS using pharmacologic manipulation of BP at rest and
during tVNS (versus sham stimulation) in PTSD patients. tVNS could be a novel
nonpharmacologic approach to reducing SNS activity and restoring BRS in these patients.
Improving SNS overactivity and BRS may have long term benefits on reducing CV risk in PTSD
patients."

The objective of this renewal project is to advance the forward viewing catheter-directed microbubble-enhanced
sonothrombolysis (FV-CAMUS) technique to the integrated dual-frequency catheter-accelerated
sonothrombolysis system (iDUCAS) for treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that affects two million
Americans every year. Current DVT treatment techniques including systemic administration of thrombolytic drugs
and mechanical thrombectomy are challenged with major limitations such as long treatment procedures (> 16
hours) and safety concerns including extensive bleeding and vessel wall damage. In the prior project period, our
team demonstrated a novel FV-CAMUS technology to treat DVT with fast lysis and with reduced off-target effects
using cavitation agents. Despite our significant advancements in FV-CAMUS based sonothrombolysis, the
clinical translation challenges remain in treatment of long (> 2 cm) retracted clots because of the lack of image
guided catheter motion control and the relatively low cavitation efficiency of phase-change nanodroplets. Thus,
in this renewal, we propose to develop the iDUCAS system by integrating intravascular imaging into a dual-
frequency ultrasound catheter, integrating motorized catheter advancement with feedback, and improving low-
power catheter-driven thrombolysis by combining microbubbles with nanodroplets. In Aim 1, an IVUS imaging
integrated iDUCAS system will be developed consisting of a dual lumen 6-French (2 mm) catheter integrated
with a dual frequency (500 kHz and 30 MHz) imaging-therapy transducer and a liquid injection conduit (contrast
agents and thrombolytic agent), the automated catheter motion control, and IVUS imaging and therapy control
units. In Aim 2, optimal nanodroplet-microbubble mixture formulation will be evaluated for use with iDUCAS
system. In Aim 3, thrombolysis efficacy and safety via in-vitro and ex-vivo tests using the iDUCAS system will
be validated, and the associated in-vitro and ex-vivo sonothrombolysis parameters will be optimized. In Aim 4,
thrombolysis efficacy and the safety of the iDUCAS system combined with low dose of thrombolytic agent will
be evaluated in the in-vivo swine DVT model with clots of different ages. We expect that the proposed iDUCAS
technology will provide a new tool enabling effective and safe treatment of DVT and other venous and arterial
thrombosis diseases."

10898277,"Project Summary/Abstract
Auditory perception can become disrupted in disorders like autism and psychosis. Higher-order auditory pro-
cessing occurs in the auditory thalamus and cortex. In turn, these areas project to the tail of the striatum (TS),
where dopamine has been shown to modulate auditory processing and sound-guided decision-making. Given
that dopamine transmission is disrupted in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders that present
with perceptual deficits, it is important to better understand the dopamine system's role in these deficits.
 Inhibiting dopamine projections to the TS has been shown to disrupt auditory discrimination, and activat-
ing these projections induces false auditory perception in mice. Our group has shown that decreases and in-
creases in dopamine transmission unbalance the activity levels of the striatum's principal output neurons: the
D1- and D2-dopamine receptor-expressing spiny projection neurons (SPNs). The goal of this proposal is to un-
derstand how excess dopamine causes false auditory perception and which striatal sub-regions and SPN types
mediate these effects. To do this, we will use viral- and mouse-genetic approaches to selectively activate specific
dopamine projections and record striatal dopamine transmission and D1- or D2-SPN Ca2+ activity. We will com-
bine these tools with a recently established behavior for measuring auditory perception confidence (APC) in
mice. Specifically, we will (1) determine the effects of selectively activating dopamine projections to the TS or
dorsomedial striatum (DMS) to determine whether these two pathways differentially modulate the frequency
and/or confidence of false auditory perceptions. Next (2) we will use miniature microscopes to image Ca2+ activity
in striatal D1- and D2-SPNs activity under normal conditions and while selectively activating nigrostriatal dopa-
mine projections during the APC task. Finally (3) we ask whether we can attenuate dopamine-driven false per-
ceptions by chemogenetically manipulating D1-SPNs vs. D2-SPNs during the APC task.
 By detailing how specific dopamine sub-circuits influence auditory perception, our experiments will inform
both the basic sensory and translational neuroscience fields. The work builds upon recent work from our labor-
atory and has the potential to unveil new therapeutic strategies for diseases with prevalent sensory deficits like
psychosis and autism. The fellowship ensures that I master the techniques associated with this proposal and
receive world-class training in in vivo imaging and genetic targeting techniques, coding and data analysis, sci-
entific communication, teaching and mentorship, and further knowledge of the basal ganglia and its implications
in disease. My training plan also entails scientific outreach in the greater Chicago area and mentorship of under-
graduate trainees. These activities are anchored by a strong co-mentorship team (Drs. Jones Parker and Raj
Awatramani) and a vibrant research and academic environment at Northwestern University."

Single cell profiling has revealed a striking cellular diversity and complexity in the mammalian nervous system.
Neurons develop their unique features by intrinsic factors, but also must adapt to local environmental features
to produce functional circuits. This raises the question: how do neurons maintain or return to stable cellular states
in the context of variable inputs? Evidence suggests that this process requires transcriptional regulation by DNA
methylation and the methyl-binding protein MeCP2. The levels of 5-methylcytosine (mC) and its oxidized form,
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC), dramatically change in the developing mammalian brain in response to intrinsic
cues and environmental input, and these marks show unique genomic patterns in different cell-types. MeCP2
modulates the effects of mC and hmC in neurons and is commonly mutated in Rett syndrome. Further, mutations
in the TET enzymes responsible for converting mC to hmC have been recently associated with neurological
disorders. Meanwhile, developmental studies indicate that neuron-specific non-CG methylation (mCH), as well
as hmC and MeCP2 build up during the postnatal period, when neurons integrate into circuits and complete their
final maturation into specific functional subtypes. This leads to the intriguing hypothesis that mC, hmC, and
MeCP2 are critical for the establishment and maintenance of diverse, specialized neuronal subtypes within
microcircuits. Recent results from us and others indicate that mC and hmC play distinct roles in neuron-specific
gene regulation and function depending on sequence context (CG vs CH) and the genomic feature (promoter,
enhancer, gene body). However, a critical barrier to testing our hypothesis is the lack of available methods to
simultaneously analyze mC and hmC across different genomic contexts on an individual allele. The primary
limitation is that the bisulfite chemistry that underlies all high-resolution mC profiling methods shears DNA to
under 300 bp. Here we propose to take advantage of the long-read capabilities of nanopore sequencers to
develop a method to accurately simultaneously profile mC and hmC in both CG and non-CG contexts across
gene promoters and bodies (Aim 1). This will allow us to address how mC and hmC coordinate in different
contexts to affect MeCP2 binding and transcriptional programs in Granule and Pukinje neuronal subtypes in the
cerebellum (Aim 2). More specifically we will address how differences in mC and hmC profiles across cell types
are read out by MeCP2 to maintain differential subtype-specific transcriptomes. We will further dissect how allele
specific patterns of this methylation, which can only be decoded using long read sequencing, contribute to
neuronal gene regulation. In the future, our approach, which can be easily implemented into standard nanopore
workflows, will enable complete sequencing and methylation analysis of clinical or research samples in a single
assay. This could lead to a profound increase in the number of available methylomes and our ability to interpret
and exploit methylation information for clinical utility."

Homeostatic signaling systems operate as protective mechanisms at the level of individual synapses, neurons,
and neural circuits to stabilize brain function and animal behavior. Defective homeostatic regulation causes
synapse and neural network instability, which is associated with multiple chronic neural disorders, such as
epilepsy, autism and Alzheimer's Disease. Glia are key players that control many different aspects of neural
development and synaptic function and are increasingly linked to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative
pathology. However, virtually nothing is known about whether and how glial signaling is involved in modulating
presynaptic neurotransmitter release in synaptic homeostasis. Our preliminary data in Drosophila suggest that
impairment of glial signaling completely abolishes presynaptic homeostasis when the nervous system is
challenged by acute or long-term synaptic perturbations. We demonstrate that glia respond to chronic inhibition
of postsynaptic glutamate receptor sensitivity by modulating their histone acetylation codes. Through a genetic
screen in Drosophila, we identified genes that function specifically in glia for the induction and sustained
expression of presynaptic homeostasis. Our preliminary data emphasize the importance of epigenetic
mechanism-mediated glial signaling in stabilizing synaptic function. We propose to fill the mechanistic gap of
understanding the glial signaling in stabilizing the brain function. We will systematically study how the interactions
between glia and neuron affect synaptic transmission and synapse stability by using a wide array of genetic,
molecular, cellular, electrophysiological, imaging and bioinformatic approaches. We will further extend our
studies to mouse hippocampal cultures to examine how astrocyte-expressed epigenetic regulators modulate
presynaptic calcium influx, neurotransmitter vesicle pool size and neurotransmitter release. Understanding the
function of glial-derived molecules in stabilizing the nervous system confronting chronic harmful stimuli will
benefit the development of new treatments and potential therapeutics for neural disorders caused by synapse
instability."

adults with chronic diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), is a unique challenge for rehabilitation.
Balance training to reduce fall risk is a critical feature of rehabilitation for older adults, especially those with PD.
However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered serious weaknesses in safely and effectively
delivering balance rehabilitation in people's homes. In fact, balance rehabilitation, for the most part, has been
deferred during the pandemic due to inability of tele-rehabilitation to remotely assess balance skills, exercise
task performance, or transfer of balance skills into daily life. We hypothesize that using objective measures for
balance assessment remotely will improve outcomes and that telerehabilitation is feasible using state-of-the-
art, evidence-based balance rehabilitation.
In 80 people with PD, we will use state-of-the-art wearable sensors to objectively measure balance in the home
and in daily life passive monitoring. In Aim I, we will determine if a virtual, instrumented balance assessment
using wearable sensors can predict performance on our gold standard, clinical in-person balance assessment
(Mini-BESTest). In Aim II, we will determine the feasibility and efficacy of a balance-focused tele-rehabilitation.
For this Aim people will be randomized into either unsupervised home exercises (standard of care) or 2)
physical therapist-supervised, balance tele-rehabilitation. In Aim III, we will explore if improvements after tele-
rehabilitation transfer to daily life mobility, measured with 7 days of passive monitoring. This project will
determine the feasibility and efficacy of using wearable sensor-based measures of balance and gait to improve
virtual assessment of balance in people with PD. Moreover, we will explore how tele-rehabilitation improves
balance and if the improvement translates to daily mobility. This outcome of this project will help develop a
more effective home-based balance and rehabilitation assessment and treatment that can be used in any older
adults with balance impairments."

In the 50 years since the genetic counseling profession began, a systematic study of genetic counseling (GC)
processes and outcomes in real-life sessions across specialties has never been conducted. In order to
optimize GC quality and improve efficiency of care, the field must first be able to accurately and
comprehensively measure GC processes and determine which processes are most critical to achieve positive
patient experiences and outcomes. The overarching objective of this study is to characterize GC processes
using a novel and pragmatic measure and to link variations in processes and session time to patient-reported
outcomes using a rigorous approach to define quality, efficient GC in practice. The central hypothesis is that
GC processes impact patient outcomes in complex ways and that by evaluating and linking processes with
outcomes we can identify ways to optimize GC quality and efficiency. To test the central hypothesis and attain
the overall objective, a reliable, pragmatic checklist will be used to measure GC processes in audio recorded
sessions and to characterize the extent and types of variability in GC processes across genetic counselors and
specialties using actual patient sessions of varying lengths. Surveys will measure patient experience,
empowerment, activation, decisional and informational needs and information overload. Coincidence analysis
will be conducted to identify patterns of GC processes that consistently make a difference for high scores on
each patient-reported measure. Comparison of the extent to which characteristics of GC sessions (including
time) influence variability in the processes used and variability in patient outcomes will be accomplished
through random effects multilevel models. We will then test the effectiveness of a GC efficiency intervention
that tailors counseling to a patients’ informational preferences and values assessments and removes select
processes found not to contribute to differences in patient outcomes using a stepped-wedge randomized
controlled study. The study will integrate perspectives from four community advisory boards and a genetic
counselor advisory board to provide vital input throughout the study process. This participatory approach was
chosen to leverage diverse perspectives to create research that is feasible, acceptable, and usable beyond the
research environment. The results of this study will be useful in considering which GC processes are essential
for optimizing various patient outcomes in minimal time for a diversity of patients. This study is expected to
improve measurement of GC processes, more clearly delineate differences in genetic counseling processes
and patient reported outcomes, and increase genetic counseling efficiency by reducing in person visit times
while maintaining or improving quality patient outcomes."

research or coursework, to acquire data without extensive training or expertise. This
inclusive approach ensures broad utilization of the instrument and promotes the
development of a diverse scientific workforce."
10879762,"SUMMARY
Short organ preservation time imposes severe constraints on transplantation, contributes to reduced organ availability and high discard rates, diminishes organ quality while exacerbating graft rejection, and limits the length and quality of life for transplant recipients. Based on studies by the U.S. organ allocation authority UNOS/OPTN, organ procurement organizations and others, the potential deceased donor organ supply has been estimated to exceed the current number of organs transplanted by up to fivefold. Consequently, the goal of developing new approaches to organ preservation has become a national priority. The current project aims at developing means for organ preservation in cryogenic temperatures, while focusing on the liver due to its high priority need. Since ice formation is the cornerstone of injury in subzero temperatures, tremendous efforts have been devoted to control and ideally circumvent it. While the addition of cryoprotective agents (CPAs) can assist in controlling ice formation, these are inherently toxic materials. One way of creating more favorable conditions for cryopreservation while reducing the adverse effects of CPAs is to elevate the pressure surrounding the organ, and thereby lowering the required CPA concentration. This approach can work if the surrounding medium remains unfrozen, whereas the relevant temperature range is known as high-subzero (HSZ). While pressure elevation can be achieved by different means, one application that drew a lot of attention in recent years relies on cooling the specimen in a constant volume container (i.e., isochoric cooling), and on the anomalous tendency of water to expand upon freezing. However, HSZ isochoric preservation does require partial crystallization somewhere in the container for the application to work, where the exact location for it to take place generally remains a source of repeated debate, speculations, and uncertainties. This research proposal aims at advancing the approach of pressure-assisted cryopreservation beyond the isochoric application, by presenting an innovative approach to eliminate the need and even the possibility for ice formation around the organ. Towards this goal, five specific aims have been formulated in an increasing level of complexity: (1) to develop an innovative cryopreservation isochoric system with superior thermal regulation means; (2) to develop a HSZ isochoric cryopreservation benchmark using the new system on an isolated rat liver perfusion model; (3) to develop an innovative pressure-modulated cryopreservation system (PMCS), which eliminates the need and even the possibility for ice formation around the cryopreserved organ; (4) to evaluate the efficacy of the PMCS on an isolated rat liver perfusion model, where results will be benchmarked against isochoric cryopreservation from SA2; and (5) to advance the scientific foundation of pressure-assisted cryopreservation, while developing multiphysics modeling tools in the service of system design, physical characterization of CPAs, and analysis of liver model experiments."

Biology is driven through the action of proteins. We know that structure often provides the foundation for proteins’
function, but in recent years it has become clear that protein function is also critically dependent on dynamics,
or movements of structure. How dynamics enables function is now a central question in protein biology that limits
our basic understanding of proteins, as well as applications in drug discovery and protein design. While there
are many types of functions that dynamics – or conformational flexibility – promotes, two functional archetypes
for dynamics are enzyme catalysis and allostery. The mechanistic bases for these two phenomena, pervasive
as they are, remain largely mysterious and have attracted much attention for the likely role of dynamics. The Lee
laboratory has focused on studying dynamics and allostery in proteins using NMR and other biophysical methods
for nearly 20 years. The approach outlined in this proposal is to combine investigation of natural allosteric
enzymes (Areas 1 and 2) with efforts to engineer allosteric regulation into signaling proteins using optogenetics
(Area 3). In the last five years, the lab has developed two complementary systems for NMR and biophysical
studies of dynamics and allostery that are highly amenable for addressing these mechanistic questions and,
importantly, developing approaches to study intersubunit allosteric communication. The two systems are the
enzymes chorismate mutase (CM) and thymidylate synthase (TS), both symmetric homodimers that are
functionally allosteric. CM (from yeast) is a classically allosteric protein, exhibiting all the hallmarks of traditional
allostery: sigmoidal activity curve; symmetric quaternary structure; tense (“T”) and relaxed (“R”) conformations;
and small molecule allosteric effector ligands that either up- or down-regulate activity. In contrast to CM’s positive
cooperativity, TS is negatively cooperative because it is half-the-sites reactive. Work will be on the E. coli (ecTS)
and human (hTS) forms, which, despite their similarities show very different behaviors. The human TS is the
target of anticancer drug 5-fluoro-uracil (5-FU). CM, ecTS, and hTS all have outstanding features for study by
solution NMR since they are highly soluble, stable, and yield excellent spectra. The goals for the next five years
fall into three main areas: (1) Through the use of NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations,
calorimetry, x-ray crystallography, and biochemistry, the structural and dynamic properties of these enzymes will
be related to functional behaviors of key interest, such as: allosteric communication; how apo state conformations
compare to T and R conformations; protomer asymmetry in singly liganded states; and the nature of the transition
state. (2) We will advance the study of protein homodimers by NMR by introducing a technology for chemical
conjugation of protomers using click chemistry. Mixed labeled dimers produced this way will facilitate NMR study
of interprotomer interactions, such as allostery, and improve NMR structure determination of homodimers. (3)
For engineered GTPases that have been artificially placed under optogenetic control, the allosteric mechanisms
will be determined using an NMR approach."

DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), an extremely toxic form of DNA damage, arise both spontaneously and in a
programmed manner during antigen receptor development. Failure to properly repair these breaks leads to a
variety of deleterious outcomes including cell death and gross chromosomal rearrangements that are a major
driver of cancer. The primary DSB repair pathway in humans is non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Deficiencies
in NHEJ result in several severe genetic diseases that are characterized by immune deficiency, sensitivity to
ionizing radiation and developmental abnormalities. Conversely overactive NHEJ in tumors provides resistance
to DSB-inducing treatments and is correlated with poor clinical prognosis. Given these observations, inhibitors
of NHEJ are a focus of therapeutical development. To fully exploit the clinical potential of these inhibitors it is
critical to understand the molecular mechanism of NHEJ and how its various steps are regulated.
 During NHEJ, DNA ends are held together by a multiprotein synaptic complex and ultimately ligated back
together. As DNA ends are often not initially compatible for ligation, several NHEJ-associated end processing
enzymes act on ends to enable ligation. Some of these end processing enzymes are error-prone; their activity
must be regulated to minimize genome alterations at the repair junction.
 In this project, we will further elucidate the molecular mechanism of DNA end synapsis and how it is
coordinated with end processing to maximize the fidelity of NHEJ. To do this we will employ novel single-molecule
imaging approaches developed by my laboratory to probe the structural dynamics of the NHEJ machinery in a
physiologically complex cell-free system. These approaches will allow us to observe how DNA ends are brought
together during repair and how protein factors are recruited to the NHEJ machinery and gain access to DNA
ends. We will pursue the following three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine how ligation is coordinated with end
processing within the Short-Range (SR) synaptic complex. Formation of the SR complex requires end binding
of the ligase which likely competes with end processing factors for DNA ends. In Aim 2, we will elucidate how
PAXX contributes to DNA end synapsis. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine how end processing factors are
regulated within the SR complex. Completion of these aims will provide rich molecular insight into how the NHEJ
machinery carries out DNA end synapsis and processing to properly repair DSBs."

This proposal brings together experts in the genomics of neuropsychiatric disorders and translational
neuroscience to investigate the molecular pathology of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Alcohol use is the fourth
leading cause of preventable death in the United States that affects over 16 million adults. Understanding the
molecular basis for individual differences in susceptibility to alcohol addiction will facilitate the development of
diagnostics and personalized therapeutics. Brain molecular phenotypes, such as gene expression and DNA
methylation can be translated into neurobiological mechanisms by identifying causal disease genes and
pathways. The central goal of this research is to identify novel lasting transcriptomic and epigenetic
changes in biological pathways harboring potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AUD. Our
central hypothesis is that genetic and epigenetic variations lead to brain region-specific dysregulation of
transcriptomic networks and disturbances in reward-related genes during AUD. This proposal will perform a
postmortem, multi-omic study of brains from 341 total subjects AUD (n=100), a psychiatric control (MDD;
N = 132) and neurotypical controls (n=109). To test our hypothesis, we will determine differential DNA
methylation and RNA expression across 8 total brain areas of the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, nucleus
accumbens and hippocampus. We will analyze RNA-sequencing of 8 discrete regions to identify transcriptional
changes in etiologically relevant AUD brain regions (Aim 1). Next, we will identify gene regulatory mechanisms
of AUD by integrating whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of matched donors and regions (Aim 2). Finally, we
will prioritize AUD genes and test whether genome-wide significant variants identified from GWAS of AUD and
alcohol-related phenotypes are associated with gene expression or DNA methylation across brain regions
(Aim 3). The expected outcome of this research will be a model of genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic
profiles of brain regions from cases versus controls that will allow us to understand the region-specific
molecular effects of AUD. By identifying new molecular mechanisms of AUD using a large number of donors
across many regions, we will be able to explicate the neurobiological mechanisms affected by AUD and
identify novel targets for intervention in the addiction process."

Solid organ transplant recipients exhibiting HLA donor specific antibodies (DSA) are at risk for graft loss due to
chronic antibody-mediated rejection (cAMR) and develop a progressive vascular disease known as transplant
vasculopathy (TV). Although cAMR and TV are highly significant clinical problems across different solid organ
transplants the mechanisms by which DSAs directed against HLA-I and HLA-II promote cAMR and TV remain
incompletely understood. Novel mechanistic targets and therapeutic approaches to prevent and treat cAMR and
TV are urgently needed. Our preliminary results show that antibody(Ab)-induced crosslinking of HLA class I
(HLA-I) molecules in endothelial cells (ECs) triggers the formation of complexes of HLA-I with integrin β4 (ITGB4)
and Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) which function as HLA-I co-receptors to elicit intracellular signaling in ECs. The
HLA-I/ITGB4 complex mediates FAK/Src, PI3K/AKT, mTORC1/2 and ERK but does not lead to exocytosis of
Weibel Palade bodies (WPbs), P-selectin externalization or leukocyte recruitment to ECs. Recently, we found
that HLA I ligation induces ITGB4-independent signaling via TLR4 and showed that HLA II signaling in ECs also
depends on TLR4 as a key co-receptor. Thus, TLR4 emerges as a central co-receptor in HLA-I and HLA-II
signaling. However, the mechanism(s) by which TLR4 elicits WPb exocytosis, P-selectin externalization and
monocyte recruitment in ECs was unknown. Our preliminary results indicate that the mechanosensitive Ca2+
channel Piezo 1 functions as a transducer of TLR4-induced exocytosis, P-selectin expression and monocyte
adherence in ECs thereby exacerbating pro-inflammatory signaling leading to TV. Based on substantial
preliminary studies, our central hypothesis is that class I and II HLA DSAs elicit key features of TV by promoting
the formation of physical and functional complexes with other membrane receptors and ion channels, including
TLR4, ITGB4 and Piezo1 on the surface of ECs of the graft to promote chronic inflammation, recruitment of
monocytes and fibrosis. We propose to explore this central hypothesis by pursuing three Specific Aims: 1) Define
a central role of TLR4 signaling in mediating HLA-I and HLA-II induced endothelial cell activation, pro-
inflammatory signaling cascades, P-selectin externalization and monocyte recruitment, all processes of
fundamental importance in the pathogenesis of transplant vasculopathy. 2) Identify a novel function of the Ca2+
channel Piezo 1 in mediating TLR4-induced endothelial cell activation, P-selectin externalization and monocyte
recruitment in response to Ab-mediated HLA I and HLA II activation. 3) Determine the impact of genetic deletion
or pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 and Piezo1 on cAMR using a novel model of murine heart allograft that
develops TV and define the molecular expression of HLA I and II signaling pathways in human cardiac allografts
with transplant vasculopathy. We anticipate that the TLR4/Piezo1 axis will emerge as a novel target in DSA-
induced cAMR and TV thus propelling studies to test existing inhibitors and develop new antagonists to prevent
chronic allograft injury induced by DSAs across multiple organs."

multidisciplinary background as a bioengineer scientist, trained in nanomedicine and basic cancer imaging, by
providing expertise in brain cancer biology and image-guided therapy of brain tumors using Magnetic Particle
Imaging (MPI). The PI will be mentored at Stanford Medical School by Drs. Sanjiv S. Gambhir (Main mentor,
basic cancer biology, cancer pathology and cancer nanotechnology), Heike Daldrup-Link (co-mentor, magnetic
nanomedicine, imaging and therapeutics), Max Wintermark (co-mentor, neuroimaging and brain MPI), Melanie
Hayden (co-mentor, neurosurgery and neurology) and Bob Sinclair (co-mentor, nanomaterials characterization).
Treatment of malignant primary brain tumors particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is challenging because
of GBM resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Also, there are different types of GBM tumors that are not
operable due to their locations in the brain (e.g. deep brain regions). In addition, routine GBM imaging in clinics
are based on using gadolinium-based magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents. However, using these
gadolinium-based contrast agents raises major concerns for GBM patients suffering from chronic kidney
disease, which can be resolved by using nanoparticle contrast agents that do not show any renal clearance due
to their larger size. The overall goal of the proposed research is to use MPI as a two-armed and high-resolution
approach for safer imaging and magnetothermal therapy of the GBM. Four types of brain tumors with different
levels of aggressiveness will be studied to identify the feasibility of the proposed method in different brain tumor
microenvironments. Recently, I developed methods for tuning iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) to generate high
resolution (i.e. ~600 µm) MPI images with ultra-high contrast agent mass sensitivity of less than ~550pg Fe/µL.
I have used MPI for three-dimensional targeted imaging of the U87 brain tumors in mice after intravenous
injection of these NPs. Additionally, in separate studies, I demonstrated the feasibility of the MPI for selective
magnetothermal therapy of the U87 tumors, when NPs were directly injected into tumors. In this project, I will
first evaluate MPI and heat generation efficiency of the NPs at different brain depths to further identify ideal NPs
design and imaging criteria for general brain tumor imaging or local magnetothermal therapy with MPI (Aim 1).
Then, I will evaluate MPI for targeted 3D imaging of four different types of intracranially implanted brain tumors
after intravenous injection of the nanoparticles, followed by nanoparticle biodistribution studies (Aim 2). Finally,
I will use intratumoral injection of my tumor-penetrating NPs for MPI-guided magnetothermal therapy of the deep
brain tumors (representative models for inoperable GBM), followed by in-depth survival and neuropathological
studies (Aim 3). Iron oxide nanoparticles have been approved by FDA for several clinical applications and we
hope that this method will ultimately find applications to many other types of solid tumors."

Our research project, entitled “Human Herpesvirus 6B in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
pathogenesis: temporal analysis of viral reactivation and immunity to elucidate cause vs effect”, aims to validate
or refute the findings of our preliminary study on the role of human herpesviruses on the severity of symptoms
in ME/CFS, and to determine if the virus reactivation is a cause or a consequence of the immune dysregulation.
We will follow-up a larger number of consenting individuals (n=306), using our rigorous protocols designed to
recruit participants to the UK ME/CFS Biobank (UKMEB). We have consent to re-contact UKMEB participants
with ME/CFS (including those with a severe form of disease), and non-diseased controls (n=>500), with clinical
assessments and collection of biosamples (blood and saliva). We will also recruit another comparison group,
consisting of people with Long-COVID presenting with symptoms typical of ME/CFS (n=30), as well as people
who did not develop long-term post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 after acute illness (Short COVID: n=30). The
study population will comprise individuals from 18 - 60 years old, who have a diagnosis for ME/CFS or Long
COVID with ME/CFS, as well as healthy controls and people who had Short COVID, in compliance with inclusion
and exclusion criteria.
We will perform a longitudinal analysis of people living with ME/CFS to determine the association and temporal
relationship between HHV-6B DNA concentration and ME/CFS symptom severity, measuring viral DNA in saliva
monthly for 6 months, alongside symptom scoring. To confirm that increases in HHV-6B DNA in saliva reflect
systemic reactivation, we will measure blood viral RNA, DNA and protein, with the hypothesis that saliva RNA
will correlate with saliva DNA concentration, and that all will increase together when ME/CFS symptoms are
elevated. We will also measure frequency, phenotype and function of HHV-6B-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
in people with ME/CFS. using flow cytometry, and will investigate the immunosuppressive effects of HHV-6B on
antigen presentation in macrophages in ME/CFS using gene expression analysis. We hypothesize that HHV-
6B-specific T cells expand as ME/CFS symptoms worsen but are ineffective in for HHV-6B control, and we will
test whether similar changes are observed in those with Long COVID in people who fulfill the diagnostic criteria
for ME/CFS.
Our goal, which stems from our successful pilot study, is to establish whether HHV-6B reactivation is causal in
ME/CFS pathogenesis, and generate biological evidence which will inform targeted interventions such as
vaccine development."
10903951,"ABSTRACT: With recent approval of whole slide scanners for primary diagnosis, wherein routine glass
histopathology slides are digitized and presented to clinical pathologists for diagnosis on computer monitors, a
wealth of new untapped data is being created in routine clinical practice and placed in growing data lakes. In
digital format, these whole slide images (WSIs) can be subjected to digital pathomics, i.e., the process of
extracting quantitative image features associated with morphology, attributes, and relationships of histologic
objects in WSIs. These features can subsequently be employed for discovery in many domains such as
histogenomics, which sees associating phenotypical presentations with biological pathways and gene
ontologies. Additionally, low-cost non-tissue destructive image-based companion diagnostic assays (CDx)
can be developed for predicting prognosis and treatment response of patients. Unfortunately, unprocessed large
data lakes (e.g., TCGA) are not alone sufficient for pathomics, and often require an intractable amount of human
curation effort in (i) performing meticulous quality control of WSI (i.e., avoid “garbage-in, garbage-out”) and
subsequently (ii) precisely annotating (e.g., cell boundary) and labeling (e.g., cell type) histologic objects. To
address these major limiting factors in curating data lakes, we propose developing our small-scale HistoTools
prototypes to employ computing clusters and thus enable their function at the scale of large digital slide
repositories (DSR): (i) HistoQC for robust, reproducible quality control of WSI by identifying artifacts (blurriness)
and outliers (poorly stained slides) for avoidance in downstream analyses, (ii) CohortFinder for identification
and compensation of batch affects, (iii) Quick Annotator for rapid computer aided annotation generation via a
combination of active and machine learning, (iv) PatchSorter for improving sub-typing of histologic objects with
machine learning. We will evaluate HistoTools for improvement of quality control and the efficiency of both
segmenting and labeling histologic objects of interest via (a) onsite curation and release of the 14k WSI used
during our internal validation and (b) supported external curation of at least 100k WSI via 24-clinical affiliates
from every continent, except Antarctica, whom together have access to over 20 million WSI during this proposal.
Our validation use cases are designed to expedite existing onsite projects in the CDx space, consisting of 4
organs (breast, lung, heart, kidney), 3 diseases (cancer, kidney disease, and organ rejection) and WSIs collected
from >70 sites. These cohort characteristics will help ensure the generalizability of our tools for curated data lake
creation, with open-source and usability study approaches employed to obtain feedback from collaborators and
the larger research community. Dissemination through consortia (ITCR, NEPTUNE) and websites (Github, TCIA)
will improve visibility and adoption. The tools and well-curated data sets we release are anticipated to bootstrap
researcher-initiated CDx discovery projects, along with the creation of their own onsite manicured data lakes.
Together, this proposal will engender digital pathology based precision medicine research."

prediction; biology; and novel treatment approaches. Investigators and projects of funded developmental
research projects are strongly encouraged to collaborate with other investigators within and outside of Yale,
including other SPORE research communities, with the goal that these projects will evolve into independent full
SPORE projects or equivalent scale studies. The objective of the YSILC DRP is to develop innovative lung

Nuclear mRNA export is a fundamental component of the gene expression program in eukaryotes and is
intimately linked to upstream (transcription and nuclear RNA surveillance) and downstream (translation and
cytoplasmic RNA decay) events. Within my group, we study the mechanisms by which the fate (nuclear export
vs. decay) of an mRNA-protein complex (mRNP) is determined and regulated. Current studies within the lab
focus on understanding how RNA-binding protein (RBP) constituents of an mRNP direct nuclear RNA processing
and export, including interactions with the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Recent efforts in my group have led to
the discovery of a novel function for the mRNA export factor Dbp5 in tRNA export and the SR-like protein Npl3
in the meiotic splicing regulatory network. In addition, we have characterized mutation-induced alterations in
polyadenylation that promote imbalances in the distribution of RBPs between mRNA and non-coding (nc)RNA
processes and the loss of nuclear RNA processing homeostasis. At the core of these events is the mRNP, which
remains ill-defined in terms of how changes in mRNP architecture, including gain or loss of specific RBPs, directs
distinct transcript fates, including mRNA export. Consequently, our goals over the next five years focus on a
quantitative interrogation of mRNP biology, encompassing function, regulation, and structure. Pursuing this goal
is timely given the newly amassed knowledge of RBPs central to both mRNA and ncRNA biology, the
technologies available to apply these questions, and the need to understand how disease states arise in the
context of mutations within conserved RBP components or their modulation by viruses. A critical factor in mRNA
export is Dbp5 (DDX19 in humans), a highly conserved DEAD-box protein (DBP) that mediates directional mRNP
export through NPCs via modulation of RNA-protein interactions. Dbp5 is activated by the NPC component Gle1-
InsP6, which we have also shown to be required for tRNA export, in addition to the known role of Gle1 in mRNA
export. Questions that must be addressed to close major knowledge gaps in the RNA export field include: (1)
How is mRNP composition regulated to achieve directional transport through NPCs? (2) Are mRNA and ncRNA
export pathways integrated or distinct? (3) Is there coordination of RNA processing and export via shared RBPs
between mRNPs and ncRNPs? By addressing these questions, we expect to provide a molecular framework
that describes how Dbp5 and other RBPs engage, modify, and direct nuclear RNA processing and export. These
data are essential to understanding the flux of RNPs through NPCs to match cellular demand and how altering
this process by mutation leads to disease. In addition, these results will contribute to the understanding and
methodology within the DEAD-box protein, RNA transport, and gene expression fields, thereby fundamentally
contributing to the study of RNA biology."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, causing neuronal synapse (spine) loss, brain
atrophy, and eventual memory loss. Although AD is expected to grow from 5.8 million affected Americans to 13.8
million by 2050, there remains no effective preventative treatment. AD research has primarily focused on treating
pathological amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles. However, recent research suggests plaque-and-tangle
pathology occurs relatively late in the disease. Recent studies in AD patients and models of disease have placed
hyperexcitability, increased pyramidal neuron firing, prior to amyloid-beta plaque pathology, providing an early
point for disease intervention. Pyramidal neuron hyperexcitability is a phenomenon that can result from an
imbalance of inhibitory/excitatory inputs. Recent literature has shown accordingly that distinct interneuron
subtypes are disrupted at this early disease state in mouse models, specifically fast-spiking parvalbumin (FS-
PV) interneurons. FS-PV interneurons display altered action potential firing in the prodromal phase of plaque
pathology in AD mouse models, resulting in pyramidal neuron hyperexcitability. It is known that firing patterns of
FS-PV interneurons can be altered through changes in the expression or biophysical properties of specific
voltage-gated channels (VGCs). This proposal seeks to determine 1. Mechanistic underpinnings of altered
FS-PV interneuron firing, and 2. If restored firing is successful in preventing pyramidal neuron
hyperexcitability and associated spine loss. In Aim 1, I predict altered FS-PV firing in pre-plaque AD is
caused by biophysical changes in VGCs. To assess these potential changes, I will use electrophysiological
methods to measure VGC biophysical changes. I will also isolate live FS-PV interneurons from wild-type and AD
mouse models to assess VGC mRNA expression changes. In Aim 2, I predict restored firing of FS-PV
interneurons in pre-plaque AD will prevent pyramidal neuron hyperexcitability and associated spine loss. In this
aim, restored firing of FS-PV interneurons will be achieved using two approaches: chemogenetics and a cell-
type-specific gene therapy. Pyramidal neuron hyperexcitability and morphology (spine loss) will be assessed
using patch-clamp electrophysiology and two-photon imaging. The results of this proposal will provide an early
point for AD intervention and a translatable therapeutic method with potential for neurodegeneration prevention."
10894704,"The goal of this project is to create an interoperable care transitions application (Care Transitions App) for
patients with multiple chronic conditions that will bridge the care transition between hospital, home, and
primary care clinic in order to reduce adverse events in the first 30 days after discharge. We propose to
develop a Care Transitions App which will engage patients and caregivers at the two trial sites, Brigham and
Women’s Hospital and Vanderbilt University Medical Center, in both inpatient and primary care settings. The
Care Transitions App will incorporate components from our prior work, specifically falls-reduction content. We
propose to create three new modules: 1) a digital post-discharge transitional care plan, 2) modules for multiple
chronic conditions (MCC: diabetes, congestive heart failure, and/or chronic kidney disease), including
condition-specific post-discharge care plans with relevant lab values and medication education, and 3) a
module for patients to enter their questions and their own goals for recovery prior to the post-discharge clinic
visit. This project will include usability testing and integration of the application with Epic via the fast healthcare
interoperability resources (FHIR) and SMART on FHIR technology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) in
Year 1. Aim 1: Utilize participatory design to develop the Care Transitions App and a multi-component
intervention, including person-based and task-based interventions delivered by a Digital Navigator. Aim 2: Pilot
test the Care Transitions App at BWH and disseminate to VUMC. 2a. We will pilot test the Care Transitions
App and use the RE-AIM framework to iteratively refine the intervention before launching the clinical trial at
BWH in Aim 3 (Y2). Later, we will pilot test the Care Transitions App at VUMC (Y5). 2b. We will disseminate
the Care Transitions App at VUMC (Y5) and use the RE-AIM framework to understand barriers and facilitators
at VUMC. Lessons learned at both sites will inform a dissemination toolkit. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of
the Care Transitions App through a cluster randomized trial enrolling patients over the age of 65 years old with
MCC including diabetes, congestive heart failure, and/or chronic kidney disease. We will test the following
hypotheses: a. The Care Transitions App will be associated with a decrease in the primary outcome, post-
discharge adverse events (falls, adverse drug events, other adverse events) within 30 days of discharge. b.
The Care Transitions App will be associated with improvements in secondary outcomes: 30-day readmissions,
completion of post-discharge phone calls, and completion of post-discharge primary care clinic visits. c. The
Care Transitions App will be associated with improvements in patient-centered outcomes: global health, self-
efficacy for managing chronic conditions, out of pocket costs, Care Transitions Measure 3, patient experience.
Outcome: Our team will develop, evaluate, and disseminate a multicomponent intervention including a Care
Transitions App and Digital Navigator training aimed at supporting safe care transitions for patients with
multiple chronic conditions and a toolkit to support widespread dissemination."
10894705,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In stark contrast to Mendelian disorders, the majority of complex trait-associated common variants map to
non-protein coding regions. Since there is a less well-developed genetic code for the much larger non-
protein coding portion of the genome, identifying the gene(s) and causal alleles underlying non-
Mendelian/complex traits presents a challenge. Given the rapidity with which genome wide association
studies (GWAS) are discovering regions associated with complex traits, causal allele and susceptibility
gene identification have become severe bottlenecks. The overall goal of this proposal is to outline a
rigorous and comprehensive strategy to discover functionally causal variants and their target genes. While
the proposal focuses on prostate cancer, the strategies can be applied to any non-protein coding locus.
The central hypothesis is that cancer risk loci are regulatory elements. Recent data convincingly
demonstrate that GWAS loci are enriched for regulatory elements. Regulatory elements control the level of
expression of genes. Causal variants are difficult to discover because the scientific community is less adept
at annotating the non-protein coding portion of the genome. This proposal seeks to develop a novel
computational and statistical framework to prioritize candidate causal variants and then to experimentally
validate these predictions. The proposal will jointly model quantitative trait loci (QTL) and allelic imbalance
(AI) signals in epigenetic data (ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq) and transcripts (RNA-seq) in a novel framework
that we term cistrome wide association studies (CWAS). The most significant CWAS loci will be subjected
to epigenome and genome editing to functionally characterize and identify causal variants.
Aim 1 will utilize novel experimental methods to create the large-scale datasets that will inform Aim 2. The
ultimate goal of Aim 1 is to perform H3K27 acetylation, and AR chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-
throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to annotate active enhancers, Assay for Transposase-Accessible
Chromatin (ATAC-seq) to identify open chromatin, and RNA-seq. All of these data will be subjected to target
enrichment at a predefined set of variants, which will enable the rigorous and systematic measurement of AI
at heterozygote sites. Aim 2 will utilize these data in a structured framework to computationally identify
statistically significant CWAS prostate risk loci that. These loci will be experimentally tested in Aim 3 where
Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) evaluation of the candidate
causal variants will be performed.
At the completion of this project, we fully anticipate that we will have begun to unravel the causal (i.e.,
pathogenic) variants that initiate human prostate cancer. Discovering the mechanisms underlying human
traits will not only inform the biology of disease, but may also reveal opportunities to more rationally
intervene in treatment and prevention."
10900598,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Implantable deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a second-line surgical neuromodulation for Parkinson's disease (PD)
that can provide significant relief of motor symptoms when medications become less effective, however there
are currently no reliable predictors of therapeutic efficacy. While the gold standard suggests that a patient will
benefit from DBS if their motor symptoms respond to PD medications with at least 30% improvement, the pre-
dictive accuracy of this criteria is variable across studies, and has been disproportionately evaluated in the con-
text of only one of two common brain targets for PD. A lack of reliable prognostic criteria to predict overall out-
comes with DBS, including risk for cognitive side-effects in balance with motor symptom improvement, has led
to variable patient outcomes. Some not considered candidates by the gold standard have been reported to re-
spond well to DBS, while others have experienced limited benefit despite strong candidacy and well positioned
electrodes. With over 4000 DBS surgeries performed in the US for PD each year, there is an increasing demand
for better prognostic tools and streamlined approaches to inform optimal candidate and brain target selection.
We aim to address this unmet need by leveraging advanced MRI techniques for improved prediction of patient
outcomes after one year of DBS. Previous studies have shown that measures of brain connectivity derived from
functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can be used to predict motor symptom response to
DBS. Brain iron accumulation in the basal ganglia, a marker of PD severity derived from susceptibility contrast
on T2* MRI, has also shown promise for predicting DBS motor outcomes. However, practical implementation of
the results from previous studies in the pre-operative setting is limited by the use of normative connectomes,
post-operative electrode coordinates, and less sensitive susceptibility techniques for prediction, along with out-
come data from only one of two brain targets for PD. To overcome these limitations, we will use patient-specific
pre-operative MRI data to predict outcomes for both PD targets. Specifically, we propose a novel multivariate
approach that incorporates fMRI and DTI with quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), a superior susceptibility
technique to T2* MRI, to enhance prediction accuracy. By using complimentary features of disease burden that
are highly relevant to DBS effects on brain connectivity and individual basal ganglia structures, we expect that
our approach will improve upon the current gold standard.
In 100 patients with PD undergoing DBS, we aim to: 1) evaluate the impact of 3T MRI on clinical prediction of
motor outcomes, 2) identify MR and clinical features most relevant for predicting overall versus individual motor
and cognitive outcomes, and 3) investigate additional variance in patient outcomes explained by post-operative
targeting accuracy. The results will provide a framework in which DBS outcomes can be reliably predicted at the
patient and symptom level to inform candidate and target selection, and even therapeutic settings. In this way,
we can ensure that resources are geared toward patients most likely to benefit from DBS."
10900599,"FXS: Late Adolescence and Early Adulthood
This application requests continued support for longitudinal research studying the bidirectional influences
exerted between children with FXS and their mothers. During the proposed period, the children will transition to
young adulthood, and we will examine how variables we have repeatedly measured since age 2 impact living
arrangements, employment status, and quality of life as young adults. We will also continue to follow their
premutation mothers, many of whom are facing transitions associated with their own aging process and the
uncertainties of having a child exit schooling and potentially leave home. Our research has demonstrated that
the FXS phenotype is driven in part by the dynamic interaction of biology, behavior, and the environment over
time. Consequently, the early adulthood period represents an opportunity to investigate the impact of variables
that have been influencing both the child and mother since early childhood (i.e., sex, autism symptomology,
maternal responsivity, language, cognition), and new variables including transition planning and the family
environment that may impact outcomes in adulthood. This project continues to be led by Drs. Nancy Brady and
Steve Warren in collaboration with Drs. Kandace Fleming and Shelley Bredin-Oja at the University of Kansas.
We propose to collect two additional data points per dyad from late adolescence to early adulthood. Among the
strengths of our study is the retention from early childhood of 46 of the original 55 dyads (84% retention rate).
Further, we plan to strengthen the generalizability of findings from the transition period by adding 12 new
participants. We propose two aims. Aim 1: To what extent do early predictors (i.e., parenting behaviors,
communication, problem behavior, autism symptomology, biomarkers) and later predictors (i.e., quality of
transition plan, parental expectations and perceptions, SES) influence employment, communication, adaptive
behavior, quality of life, independence, and self-determination of adolescents transitioning to adulthood? Aim
2: To what extent do early and later predictors (i.e., child behaviors and communication, and maternal mental
health and biomarkers) influence mothers' executive functioning, word retrieval, perceived anxiety, depression
and caregiver burden, partner support, satisfaction with IEP transition plans, and community support during
transition to adulthood? Together these aims will provide empirical insights into a largely unstudied age period.
The longitudinal nature of our study, with up to 10 data points per dyad, will be used to identify predictors of
outcomes as well as possible treatment targets and timing for interventions on these targets for those who
have poorer outcomes."
10874655,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Whole-genome sequencing has become a popular approach for comprehensive genome-wide characterization of
genomic alterations, ranging from single nucleotide variants and indels to copy number changes and complex
structural alterations. However, standard bulk sequencing provides information on the population average of the
cells, and our understanding of genetic heterogeneity and clonal dynamics remains inadequate. In the proposed
work, we aim to develop computational methods for analysis of single cell whole-genome sequencing data. Due
to the allelic bias and artifacts associated with the DNA ampliﬁcation step, accurate identiﬁcation of genomic
alterations is challenging. In Aim 1, we will develop methods to identify single nucleotide variants and indels,
building on our experience in analysis of single neurons and utilizing the latest ampliﬁcation techniques. In Aim
2, we will focus on methods to detect copy number variants, structural variants, and tandem repeat mutations.
We will employ machine learning models including graph- and autoencoder-based deep learning approaches.
In Aim 3, we will apply the methods devised in the ﬁrst two aims to several important biological questions
that can be best resolved by single cell DNA sequencing. These include identiﬁcation of off-target effects and
on-target efﬁciency of genome editing, lineage tracing in development using somatic mutations as endogenous
barcodes, correlation of driver mutation and copy number alterations in cancer cells, and quantiﬁcation of impact
of environmental exposure on the mutational landscape. A single cell view of these biological phenomenon will
yield new insights into the underlying processes, and the tools developed in this project will be applicable to a
wide range of biological and biomedical problems."

Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is a severe, life-long neurodevelopmental disorder. It afflicts hundreds of
thousands of children in the US and worldwide. The highly distressing, disruptive, and disabling behavioral
symptoms of PAE include inattention, hyperactivity, and executive dysfunction, symptoms that overlap with
those of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In ADHD, these symptoms are treated routinely with
stimulant medications. But children with PAE often fail to respond to stimulants, or to any therapy. There has
long been, therefore, a pressing need for new treatments for PAE. This R61/R33 proposal is about one
prospective way to meet that need. Recently, it was demonstrated at UCLA that trigeminal nerve stimulation
(TNS) is safe and effective in treating pediatric ADHD. TNS is a low-current neurostimulatory therapy that is
noninvasive, minimal-risk, and now FDA-cleared. Given the similarities PAE has with ADHD, there is a very
good (though not 100%) chance that PAE would respond to TNS as well. But, to our knowledge, TNS has
never been tested systematically in children with PAE. Here we propose the first clinical trial of TNS for PAE.
The R61 (pilot) phase will determine whether TNS is feasible for PAE: Do children with PAE comply with the
TNS procedure? Does TNS have any any serious side effects in these children? Is there an indication that
TNS relieves symptoms of PAE? If the pilot shows feasibility, as we expect it will, in the ensuing R33 phase we
will conduct a formal double-blind sham-controlled randomized clinical trial to determine rigorously whether
TNS is truly efficacious for PAE. If it is, the impact could be enormous. TNS could bring much needed relief to
children with PAE and their families everywhere. Our proposal will furthermore address the need to understand
the brain mechanisms by which TNS works, which are underexplored and largely unknown. The few studies
done to date point to three major candidate brain regions where TNS may exercise its therapeutic effects. All
three are regions where we, in prior work, detected differences between children with PAE and typically
developing children in tissue properties (“endpoints”) measured using multiple different varieties (“modalities”)
of brain MRI. These findings raise our confidence that TNS will be effective for PAE, i.e., if the brain regions
that produce PAE symptoms are the same as those acted upon by TNS, maybe TNS will quell those
symptoms. In both phases of this clinical trial we will measure the same endpoints with the same modalities of
brain MRI in children with PAE before and after TNS treatment. We will determine whether these endpoints are
changed by TNS (target engagement) and/or predict TNS clinical response (prognostic marker) in individual
patients in the three candidate regions or elsewhere in the brain. If successful, this proposal will help meet a
long-standing urgent need for novel treatments for PAE and will help clarify the currently mysterious brain
mechanisms of an emerging pediatric neurostimulatory therapy."

This R34 application responds to RFA-MH-23-260 by adapting and piloting a novel intervention for suicide
prevention in primary care for women at moderate or high risk for suicide in a low- and middle income
countries. The study takes place in Tajikistan, a postwar country in Central Asia, where Dr. Weine, Dr. Pirova,
Dr. Bahromov, and other collaborators successfully implemented a D43 research capacity building project and
an R21 and R01 on stepped care for women’s mental health in primary care. This study also builds on the
team’s prior research that demonstrated the effectiveness of nurse- and peer-led interventions, identified risk
and protective factors for suicide among women, and on the PREVAIL peer-led suicide prevention model. The
specific aims for this new project are: Aim 1: Adapt the evidence-based PREVAIL model into a new SUSTAIN
nurse- and peer-led suicide prevention model in primary care for women at moderate or high suicide risk in
rural and urban Tajikistan using a participatory co-design process (the Transcreation Framework) with multi-
level partners. Aim 2: Evaluate a pilot implementation of the SUSTAIN model in primary care among 96
women with moderate to high suicide risk, 48 randomized to SUSTAIN and 48 to an enhanced usual care
condition, with both groups followed for 9 months for suicidal ideations or behaviors, mental health outcomes,
and mediators. Aim 3: Assess the acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, potential for scalability and
sustainability, programmatic costs, partnership, and equity of SUSTAIN to inform a future hybrid type 2
effectiveness-implementation pragmatic trial. The project will also build knowledge, skills, and capacities that
will inform future research on testing and implementation of multi-level approaches to suicide prevention which
can be part of an emerging national strategy in Tajikistan."
10875608,"The breadth and depth of research on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD)
does not currently match the urgency or significance of the issue worldwide. While funding
represents one limiting factor, a second is the need for more interdisciplinary interest, expertise,
and collaboration, particularly for early stage investigators. The Alzheimer's Association (AA)
has a 30 plus year history of increasing awareness, supporting research, and providing
dementia education and training to a variety of constituents. Our headquarters in Chicago offer
state-of-the-art conference space and communication technologies. In line with the AA's 10-year
vision to accelerate scientific progress toward the national goal of preventing and effectively
treating Alzheimer's by 2025, we therefore propose to develop and offer an annual Alzheimer's
Association Summer Interdisciplinary Research Institute (AA-ISRI) on ADRD for emerging
independent researchers (MD, PhD, or other doctoral level degree). In response to expert and
public calls for greater research emphasis on the psychosocial and public health aspects of
dementia, the course will include group didactics and a dual track portion, in which attendees
will learn more intensively about their chosen track: psychosocial (encompassing psychological
and sociological aspect of ADRD research), and public health (encompassing health services
research and health care policy in relation to ADRD). To accomplish this, we will develop the
training, mentoring, recruitment, evaluation, modification, dissemination, and sustainability plans
and materials for the course (Aim 1); implement the AA-ISRI annually for five years (Aim 2);
regularly evaluate the curriculum, faculty, and ongoing mentoring via surveys and emailed
questionnaires and make modifications where needed (Aim 3); and facilitate dissemination and
sustainability (both the sustainability of the mentoring/networks created via course attendance
and the sustainability of the course itself past the 5-year grant mechanism) (Aim 4). A mix of
didactic, small group discussion, and one on one mentoring will be offered, with an emphasis on
networking and career building opportunities. Our short term goals are to provide attendees the
tools and resources needed to enter, expand upon, and succeed in the field of dementia
research. Our long-term goal is to encourage more early stage investigators from a broad range
of backgrounds to include dementia-related research in their research career plans, thereby
increasing the overall number and interdisciplinary breadth of the research workforce in
dementia science, facilitating a faster pace of discovery.

 Through PAR-19-301, NIGMS seeks to support mission relevant resources that will have the economy of
scale to provide increased access to state-of-the-art services for a substantial regional or national user base. In
response, we are applying for NIGMS National Resource support for the IDeA National Resource for Quantitative
Proteomics. This resource was created in 2016 using NIGMS-funding from the IDeA (Institutional Development
Award) Program that supports research in 23 states and Puerto Rico that have historically received lower levels
of NIH funding. The IDeA National Resource for Quantitative Proteomics was created by regional consolidation
of instrumentation, proteomics expertise, and associated bioinformatics resources across Arkansas and
Oklahoma. The resource was created because IDeA investigators across the United States can face specific
challenges for accessing cutting-edge proteomics resources and bioinformatics expertise for data interpretation.
These challenges include the cost of rapidly advancing instrumentation, availability of the personnel expertise
those instruments demand, and access to bioinformaticians trained in proteomics. Arkansas and Oklahoma were
positioned to unify their respective infrastructures to fill these resource gaps and provide a comprehensive
solution for quantitative proteomics to the IDeA network. Our resource has had three years to become fully
established and reach economy of scale. We have served a diverse set of IDeA investigators for their NIGMS
relevant research, ranging from studies on model organisms to diseases such as cancer. The goal of this
proposal is to transition the IDeA National Resource for Quantitative Proteomics to a NIGMS National Resource
in order to expand our ability to serve the quantitative proteomics needs of the IDeA network. We will continue
to provide user-friendly services for state-of-the-art, quantitative proteomics that will guide the user from service
request to sophisticated bioinformatics analysis to delivery of publication ready data. This resource will continue
to support the biomedical research mission of NIGMS and NIH for both fundamental and translational research
focused on human diseases including cancer. We will use the following Specific Aims to accomplish our goal: 1)
Provide state-of-the-art quantitative proteomics services to the IDeA network, 2) Provide outreach opportunities
for quantitative proteomics to the IDeA network, and 3) Provide educational opportunities for quantitative

Candidate: Juliet Emamaullee is an Assistant Professor of Clinical Surgery at the University of Southern
California (USC) and an attending liver and kidney transplant surgeon at Keck Hospital and Children’s Hospital-
Los Angeles. Dr. Emamaullee has been working with her proposed K08 mentor, Dr. Omid Akbari, and her co-
mentor, Dr. Shahab Asgharzadeh, to learn about mass cytometry approaches to characterize immune responses
and now has begun independent work to develop these techniques to analyze the process of rejection in liver
transplant (LT) recipients. The project aims to provide her with additional skills and knowledge required to
achieve her long-term goal of studying the immunologic mechanisms involved in development and progression
of LT rejection in order to develop new diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic approaches to improve post-LT
outcomes.
Career Development Plan: Dr. Emamaullee has strategically planned to gain the necessary training and
mentoring that will be required for her successful transition to being an independent investigator through select
coursework and a robust mentoring plan. She has also organized an advisory committee composed not only of
leaders in the field but also those able to directly impact her career advancement. The immediate training
objectives are focused on consolidating her expertise in: (1) advanced immunological techniques including mass
cytometry; (2) bioinformatics and data analysis; and (3) immunological pathways of rejection in clinical LT. This
will not only ensure that Dr. Emamaullee's research project progresses as planned but will also ensure her
progress will be recognized through promotion and obtaining independent research funding. She has an
impactful, unique research project that is sufficiently different from her mentor's research to avoid competition or
overlap.
Research Plan: The proposed study leverages the extensive resources available at USC to address an important
public health issue, which makes it directly relevant to the NIH mission. Hepatocellular carcinoma is on pace to
become the leading global indication for LT, and rejection continues to be an important cause of graft loss and
failure post-transplant. The diagnosis of rejection is not correlative to changes in liver blood tests and thus
requires an invasive biopsy. Recently, there have been significant advances in the sensitivity of techniques to
characterize immune responses, even in small tissue samples. We hypothesize that a liver-focused immune
panel can be developed using imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to deeply analyze intrahepatic immune infiltrates
in human liver tissue. We also hypothesize that graft-infiltrating lymphocytes can be characterized using IMC to
better understand which subpopulations mediate allograft rejection in LT. First, we will develop a Liver
Immunology IMC Panel using tissue obtained from LT patients with chronic rejection. Furthermore, we will utilize
this assay to characterize graft-infiltrating lymphocyte subpopulations in chronic rejection and compare to results
obtain using tissue obtained from LT patients with acute rejection. Immune profiles in each phase of rejection
will be quantified and mapped, as well as compared to clinical parameters. Lastly, we will study LT patients
prospectively to determine if these rejection-associated lymphocytes can be tracked in the blood during and after
episodes of rejection. This project represents the first application of IMC in solid organ transplantation and has
the potential to expand our knowledge of alloimmunity in clinical LT, which could provide the basis for a
noninvasive assay of rejection in LT patients."

 Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) is a very aggressive and deadly disease with poor survival
rates following maximal treatments such as surgery and chemoradiotherapy. The immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment (TME) is a major barrier of response to traditional and immune based therapies with only
~15% of patients with recurrent head and neck cancer responding to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Myeloid cells
are; abundant in the TME, key mediators of T cell function, and can influence clinical outcomes both positively
and negatively. We seek to understand the contribution of myeloid cells to the immunosuppressive TME and
advance strategies to modulate these cells in a favorable way, to enhance OCSCC tumor killing.
 Our group has developed a novel vaccine treatment platform that can reprogram the intratumoral and
peripheral myeloid cell compartment to an anti-tumor state. This platform leverages the use of clinically
translatable lipid nanoparticles (NPs), combined with personalized tumor derived mRNA (TDRNA) that
simultaneously functions as both a vaccine and an immunomodulating agent. We have demonstrated that
TDRNA-NP vaccines have significant anti-tumor activity in OCSCC preclinical models and synergize with
immune checkpoint inhibitors. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanism of TDRNA-NP induced myeloid cell
mediated immune responses by investigating vaccine induced myeloid cell proliferation, activation and
trafficking in preclinical models of OCSCC. In Aim 2, we will identify the mechanistic role of myeloid cells
in the synergy between TDRNA-NP vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitors in murine models of
OCSCC. In Aim 3, we will examine the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of TDRNA-NPs in client-owned
felines with spontaneously occurring oral squamous cell carcinoma. These studies will give us insight into
the role of the myeloid cell compartment in OCSCC and advance a promising vaccine technology towards
first-in-human clinical trials. The P.I. of this project is a head and neck surgical oncologist and
witnesses the daily impact head and neck cancer has on patients and recognizes the need to
improve patient care through translational research. She is an active member of the Head and Neck
oncology program, is strongly supported by her department, and has a mentoring team comprised of world
renowned expert tumor immunologist/translational researchers, and head and neck surgeon-scientists. This
mentored training and educational program has been carefully designed with research and career objectives
that will allow the P.I. to progress toward becoming an expert head and neck cancer immunologist and
translational researcher. In summary, this proposal has significant potential to dramatically impact the lives
of patients with OCSCC and will provide substantial training and mentorship for the P.I. to become an
independent investigator."

Amyloid aggregation of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is associated with β-cell death in type-2 diabetes
(T2D). IAPP, a peptide hormone co-secreted with insulin by β-cells, is one of the most amyloidogenic proteins
and readily forms amyloid fibrils in vitro. Mounting evidence suggests that inhibition of IAPP aggregation and
aggregation-mediated cytotoxicity, our long-term goal, is an attractive therapeutic strategy to prevent β-cell
death and stop the progression of diabetic conditions in T2D. With the recent advances of Cryo-EM in
Structural Biology, atomic structures of IAPP fibrils have been solved, comprised of parallel in-register β-sheets
as the cross-β core. However, due to heterogeneous and transient nature of oligomer intermediates populated
during aggregation, many details of the process from isolated monomers to final fibrils are still unknown. With
amyloid toxicity likely mediated by direct or indirect interactions with the cell membrane, it is increasingly
important to study the aggregation of IAPP in the membrane environment. Increasing evidence also suggests
pathological correlations between different amyloid diseases – e.g., T2D is the risk factor of neurodegenerative
diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases; and bacterial amyloids may contribute to the onset
of neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes. Cross-interactions between different amyloid proteins at the
molecular level might contribute to the pathological correlation between corresponding diseases. We have
demonstrated that novel nanoparticles can be engineered to mitigate hIAPP aggregation and cytotoxicity.
Despite many advantages including the ability to cross biological barriers, major concerns for nanomedicine
development include potential toxicity associated with immune responses and the lack of specificity. In this
MIRA renewal application, the PI proposes to continuously uncover molecular mechanisms of IAPP
aggregation and to explore novel nanoparticle approaches to inhibit IAPP aggregation and toxicity in the
following directions: 1) IAPP aggregation and interactions with the membrane; 2) cross-interactions between
hIAPP and other amyloidogenic proteins; and 3) mitigation of IAPP amyloidosis with nanoparticles
functionalized by endogenous inhibitors. The PI lab will combine computational modeling with experimental
characterization and validation. Computational modeling can help bridge the time and length scale gaps
between experimental observations and the underlying molecular systems, providing not only molecular
insights to experimental observations but also offering experimentally-testable hypotheses. Such a combined
computational and experimental approach can improve research efficiency and shorten discovery cycle. The
outcome of the proposed studies will help understand disease mechanisms and discover novel therapeutic
targets (Project 1); provide molecular bases for pathological correlations between T2D and other amyloid
diseases, and the contribution of bacterial infections and dysbiosis to the onset of T2D (Project 2); and offer
new approaches to design anti-amyloid nanoparticles with high specificity and reduced nanotoxicity (Project 3).

important roles in regulating a significant number of physiological and pathophysiological processes. ADP-
ribosylated proteins can be recognized by reader proteins, triggering downstream signaling cascades or effector
functions in direct or indirect manners. The ADP-ribosylation-mediated signaling can be modulated by eraser
proteins that rapidly remove covalently attached ADP-ribose unit(s). In addition to their extensive involvements
in physiological events, the writers, readers, and erasers of protein ADP-ribosylation are broadly implicated in
numerous diseases. However, it remains elusive for the functions and roles of ADP-ribosylation in human health
and pathogenesis of many diseases. Despite technological advancement, little information is known regarding
the identity of the reader(s) and eraser(s) for individual ADP-ribosylated proteins, the preferred ADP-ribosylated
protein(s) for a specific reader or eraser protein, and the ADP-ribosylation-centered interaction networks. And
tools and technologies have yet to be developed for unambiguously mapping ADP-ribosylation-dependent
interactome. The goal of this MIRA project is to develop novel chemical tools to address these major challenges.
In next five years, we are aimed to generate novel bifunctional NAD+ molecules for unbiased and faithful
dissection of ADP-ribosylation-dependent interactome and define their roles in cell signaling. Successful
completion of this work will result in a set of novel and important chemical tools for addressing challenges in
research on ADP-ribosylation-dependent events and processes across multiple areas. These innovative tools
may lead to major breakthroughs in understanding of the cellular functions and regulatory roles of protein ADP-
ribosylation in physiology and pathophysiology and in the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics
targeting ADP-ribosylation-associated activities and pathways for many human diseases."
10875520,"Abstract:
Spinal cord injuries (SCI) affect approximately 100,000 patients each year and causes motor,
sensory and autonomic dysfunction. Approximately 55% of all SCIs occur at the cervical level in
human patients that effect forelimb. Patients effected by a cervical SCI desire recovery of hand
and digit function to improve their current lifestyle. However, the majority of spinal cord injury
models study the functional recovery associates with locomotion after thoracic lesions and not
skilled forelimb patterning after cervical injuries. In general, skilled forelimb patterning is
mediated through the corticospinal tract with support from indirect brainstem regions. Lesions
that cut the corticospinal tract show significant loss of forelimb patterning; however, when the
indirect pathways are preserved, rehabilitative training supports the recovery of the lost function.
We show that this recovery is mediated by C3-C4 propriospinal neurons, a unique propriospinal
neuron normally involved in the formation of an internal motor copy to correct movement errors
during the movement. In this pathway, error correction is mediated by C3-C4 PN axons
terminating onto neurons in the lateral reticular nucleus, a pre-cerebellar nucleus. Information is
then routed through the cerebellum where the motor plan is compared to proprioceptive sensory
information from the forelimb and back to brainstem motor control regions for execution. We
hypothesize that after cervical injury this pathway undergoes rehabilitative adaptation to
compensate for loss of the CST. Here we will take a systems approach to interrogate three
components required for error correction and adaptation of this pathway. The first aim will
examine the integration of information from several forelimb control pathways into the LRN and
if modulation of LRN neuronal activity during rehabilitation augments recovery. The second aim
will investigate the role of unconscious proprioceptive sensory information in rehabilitative
recovery of injury. The third aim, will investigate the cerebellar efferent pathways connecting to
know reticular regions involved in forelimb movements to determine their importance in driving
recovery and error correction after cervical injury and during rehabilitation. Ultimately, this study
will provide essential data to identify the pathways involved in rehabilitative recovery of skilled
forelimb patterning after spinal cord injury and if recovery can be enhanced by activity
dependent modulation during rehabilitative training."

Bipolar disorder is a common psychiatric disease with few treatment options and no cure. One of the most
commonly prescribed medications for treatment of acute mania and mood stabilization is the anticonvulsant
drug, valproate (VPA; trade name Depakote). This medication has been used since the mid-1990s, however not
everyone responds equally to VPA in terms of therapeutic efficacy and it can produce multiple, often severe side
effects. Moreover, VPA has a variety of molecular targets and it is unclear which targets are therapeutically
relevant. Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that normalize mania in response to VPA could
lead to more targeted treatments in the future which produce a higher therapeutic response with less side effects.
In the first funding cycle of this grant, we discovered that the therapeutic actions of VPA appear to occur via it’s
inhibition of a protein called histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) specifically in a part of the brain that contains a
large number of dopaminergic neurons, the ventral tegmental area (VTA). HDAC2 is involved in the regulation
of gene expression on a wide scale, so while the inhibition of this protein is perhaps more targeted than VPA
treatment, it is still advantageous for us to identify the important genes who’s expression is changed as a result
of HDAC2 inhibition in the VTA. To identify these targets, we will first determine which genes are normally bound
by HDAC2 and what changes to histone acetylation occur in response to HDAC2 inhibition in the VTA using two
animal models that have a behavioral profile that is strikingly similar to human mania and increased dopaminergic
activity in the VTA. We will then determine which gene and protein expression changes occur with HDAC2
inhibition and combine these results with those of the first Aim, and our prior results, to determine the particular
proteins that might be likely therapeutic candidates. In Aim 3 we will then determine the impact of HDAC2
inhibition and direct target genes of HDAC2 on VTA dopaminergic activity and signaling in our mouse models to
help identify the mechanisms by which HDAC2 target genes might normalize human mania. Taken together, this
study will help us to identify novel therapeutic targets and their mechanism of action for the treatment of bipolar
disorder."

The Molecular Biophysics Training Program (MBTP) at The Ohio State University (OSU) was formed in 2017 as
an organizing principle for training and interaction in molecular biophysics. OSU is a comprehensive public land
grant university, one of the largest in the nation, and nearly 20% of its students are from minority groups. OSU
has a strong group of researchers and attracts a strong student pool in molecular biophysics, but graduate
training and the research community were fragmented over several graduate programs, departments, and
colleges. We have made great progress in building a unified molecular biophysics community through a shared
mission of training the next generation of quantitative biomedical scientists. MBTP brings disparate groups
together and creates an integrated training experience, in which students from three different graduate programs
(Biophysics, the Ohio State Biochemistry Program, and the Chemistry Graduate Program) and many different
undergraduate majors learn from each other and from a broader group of mentors. All trainees obtain core
training in macromolecular and physical biochemistry, in the fundamentals of biophysics, and in the responsible
conduct of research with the highest standard of rigor and reproducibility. This breadth ensures that trainees can
communicate equally well about our most challenging biomedical problems and about the modern quantitative
and molecular methods to address these, while being responsible citizens and researchers. A coordinated plan
from a wide selection of elective courses ensures that students have enough depth to be successful in their
research projects. A monthly workshop series and a yearly symposium provide cohesion to the program and
incorporate unique training opportunities in career exploration, professional development, mentoring best
practices, and continuous engagement with ethics training. Here we propose to deepen and expand this project,
drawing in a large, diverse community of new young investigators in medicine and engineering as trainers,
training a larger though still highly diverse cohort of students, raising the rigor of quantitative skills, and expanding
focus areas to include cryo-EM and biomedical engineering. At the same time, trainers will engage in evidence-
based practices to elevate their mentoring skills. The resources invested in the program by NIH will be
augmented by the institution, together allowing us to recruit and retain the strongest interdisciplinary students
with greater inclusion of underrepresented groups. Guiding principles of excellence, collaboration and
interdisciplinarity, and diversity and inclusion are used to build on our original plan for the highest quality training,
research and career development for students of molecular biophysics."

 Animal models play a vital role in the establishment and refinement of improved therapies for various
cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Thus, when the NDSU Center for Diagnostic
and Therapeutic Strategies in Pancreatic Cancer was established, a key component included was the Animal
Research Core Facility. During Phase I of this project, the Animal Core has made significant contributions to
the COBRE project's mission and the overall NDSU research community. A breeding colony of nod-SCID-
gamma (NSG™) mice was founded and used in multiple grafting studies, including subcutaneous, orthotopic,
and patient-derived xenograft implantations. The Core also established a colony of genetically engineered
LSL-KrasG12D/+; LSL-Trp53R172H/+; Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) mice to complement these NSG™ studies. These
achievements allowed the Animal Core to complete our original goals of enhancing basic and translational
studies devoted to detecting and treating pancreatic cancer and strengthening biomedical research at NDSU.
For Phase II, the Animal Core aims are 1) to support the scientific and animal needs of individual Junior
Investigators, Pilot Project Investigators, new and existing faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students
associated with the CDTSPC; and 2) to increase the sustainability of the Animal Core Research platform.
These aims will be achieved by establishing new colonies of genetically engineered models (including KC-
smad4 and KC-Tgfbr2 strains), establishing a tissue biobank for archival maintenance of PDAC and other
cancer samples, and expanding services to include on-site histology analysis and advanced imaging
modalities."

Cutaneous viral infections, including vector-borne viruses, cause significant morbidity and mortality.
Vector-borne viruses are transmitted first to the skin through mosquito bites, then disseminate, causing a broad
spectrum of frequently devastating disease. Yet, strategies to thwart cutaneous viruses remain elusive.
Resident memory T cells (TRM) represent a promising target due to their potent effector functions and
localization at barrier tissues including the skin. In contrast to recirculating memory T cells, TRM stably occupy
nonlymphoid tissues (NLT) where they rapidly detect pathogen reinfection and initiate protective anamnestic
immune responses. In fact, skin TRM can provide complete protection against cutaneous challenge through
direct killing of infected cells and innate-like effector functions that establish an antiviral state. Extensive
preliminary data supports the broad range of TRM functions that can be leveraged therapeutically. It is unknown,
however, if skin TRM can be directed to limit viral spread in acute infection after targeted immunization. By
focusing on antiviral CD8 TRM populations in the skin, this proposal will identify TRM functions in host immunity
that may be harnessed against skin-borne infectious diseases. Building on preliminary data, Aim 1 will
determine whether CD8 TRM reactivation orchestrates immune cells in the skin. Aim 2 will determine the extent
to which skin TRM influence distal immunity. TRM must function from a fixed location, yet it is unclear if they are
to serve as a local alarm or one that is amplified to enhance immunity at other sites. Observations that local
inflammation has far-reaching effects on other tissues, creating a cascade of responses that heighten immunity
at an organismal level lend credence to the idea TRM provoke systemic immune effects. By understanding how
we can utilize TRM through TCR-dependent processes, we may be able to wield this population in a more broad
manner. Given the many parallels between mouse and human TRM, findings in my studies using reductionist
mouse models may readily be applied to clinical therapeutics."
10900230,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, are immune-mediated
gastrointestinal disorders associated with chronic medical and psychosocial dysfunction. IBD is increasingly
conceptualized as a product of the bidirectional communications between the central nervous system, the
autonomic nervous system (ANS), and the gut, referred to as the brain-gut axis. Consistent with this model,
adolescents with IBD demonstrate dysfunction of the ANS indicative of a chronic stress response and are at
increased risk for chronic psychological distress characterized by anxiety and depression. Treating ANS
dysfunction has emerged as a common and relatively easy to treat target to reduce psychological symptoms
as well as potentially ameliorate the disease symptoms of IBD. Through our prior work with pediatric IBD
patients, we have demonstrated that heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive, acceptable, and feasible
measure of ANS functioning that we can reliably assess in youth with IBD and treat through HRV biofeedback.
In our prior work, we developed and evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a
virtually delivered, group-based HRV biofeedback-enhanced coping skills treatment program for adolescents
diagnosed with IBD (K23DK122115). The goal of the proposed work is to build upon compelling preliminary
findings to test intervention efficacy via a randomized waitlist-controlled trial of our HRV biofeedback-enhanced
coping skills treatment program in a sample of adolescents ages 13-18 diagnosed with IBD and who screen
positive for symptoms of anxiety and/or depression; n = 128. The treatment program is based on evidence-
based cognitive behavioral therapy treatment principles and uses HRV biofeedback as an adjunctive treatment
component to treat autonomic dysfunction. With R01 support, our multidisciplinary team of experts in
behavioral interventions incorporating HRV biofeedback, pediatric IBD, and clinical trial design will determine if
treatment (1) improves psychological outcomes and (2) symptoms of IBD including reductions in disease
activity and inflammatory markers, relative to controls. Further, we will determine the mechanistic role of HRV
on psychological and IBD symptoms as a function of treatment. Support for a virtually delivered, HRV
biofeedback-enhanced coping skills treatment program for youth with IBD to address psychological outcomes
and symptoms of IBD would provide a scalable, innovative treatment option for the growing number of affected
pediatric patients. Further, if successful, we will demonstrate that HRV is a modifiable biomarker of autonomic
dysfunction responsive to biofeedback training and mechanistically responsible for intervention effects on
psychological and clinical outcomes as well as markers of inflammation."

Unfortunately, ~20% of kidneys donated for transplant are discarded due to short storage viability (~24-36 h).
Cryopreservation decreases storage temperatures below -140oC, enabling storage of kidneys for months to
years. To re-warm cryopreserved kidneys without ice formation and cracking, fast and even warming is needed.
For this, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) can be perfused into them prior to cooling, then radiofrequency waves
can be applied to rapidly rotate their magnetic moments, causing local heating around IONPs and kidney re-
warming. Despite initial success of this method in rat kidneys, the complex behavior of IONPs (uneven particle
distribution, aggregation, etc.) limits reproducibility and is a major bottleneck in its translation to human organs.
Currently there is no low-cost method to nondestructively track IONPs in organs across concentrations of interest.
Thus, there is a need for precise monitoring of IONP concentrations (1) after perfusion, to ensure even IONP
distribution and therefore even kidney heating and viability, and (2) prior to transplant, to prevent potential IONP-
related iron toxicity post-transplant. To address this, our lab has developed a low-cost, longitudinally detected
electron paramagnetic resonance (LOD-EPR) system that can directly detect electrons in IONPs. LOD-EPR is
sensitive to IONP concentration in solution and in IONP-loaded kidney biopsies with improved accuracy in tissue
compared to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based on data under review. This project aims to develop
LOD-EPR into an IONP quantification and imaging system for cryopreserved rat kidneys and compare
its accuracy to similar techniques such as magnetic particle imaging, and micro-CT. Aim 1 will improve
the sensitivity of LOD-EPR through hardware changes on receive and transmit and increase the bore size to fit
whole rat kidneys. Aim 2 will develop the LOD-EPR system into an imaging system primarily by implementing
permanent magnet-based linear gradients. Its IONP quantification accuracy and imaging resolution will be
compared to magnetic particle imaging and micro-CT in IONP-perfused whole rat kidneys. By enabling IONP
monitoring during the cryopreservation process, IONP synthesis, kidney perfusion, and radiofrequency heating
parameters can be fully optimized for increased kidney viability during re-warming. This will ultimately expedite
development of kidney cryopreservation to increase transplant availability."

Metabolic dysregulation due to in utero and early-life environmental exposures has lasting consequences on
the developing immune system and lung and that these changes underlie the pathobiology of childhood atopy
and wheeze. However, significant gaps remain in understanding the dysregulated metabolic-immune pathways
and mechanisms involved in early childhood atopy and wheeze. Our preliminary study of the infant untargeted
metabolome demonstrated that dysregulation in the unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) and lipid mediator's pathway
are associated with number of wheeze episodes in a dose-response manner, which suggests the involvement
of endogenous antioxidant and lipid mediator pathways. In another preliminary study of the infant immunome,
we demonstrated that two distinct infant immune response profiles to acute respiratory infection, with an
immune response pattern characterized by increased Type-2 and Type-17 and decreased non-interferon Type-
1 immune responses to with increased risk of recurrent wheeze. While these single omics studies can identify
dysregulated metabolites and immune-responses in wheeze phenotypes, they alone fail to capture the full
spectrum of underlying pathobiology. The integration of omics data has advanced the understanding of other
chronic disease pathogenesis, as it is likely to do for childhood atopy and wheeze. Therefore, we hypothesize
that the integration of early-life metabolome (including lipidome) and immunome can elucidate molecular
pathways relevant to atopy and wheeze development. To test this hypothesis, the candidate will capitalize on
existing carefully phenotyped population-based birth cohort of healthy infants (INSPIRE) and a replication
cohort from the NIH ECHO initiative (ECHO-CREW asthma consortium) and accomplish the following specific
aims: 1) To investigate whether increased unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) levels reduce early life atopy and
wheeze incidence by enhancing the bioavailability of pro-resolving lipid mediators and antioxidants and
decreasing pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, 2) To discover novel immunome profiles and network modules
that characterize atopy and wheeze phenotypes, and 3) To uncover novel metabolic-immune molecular
pathways associated with the development of atopy and wheeze phenotypes by integrating metabolome and
immunome data. Successful completion of these aims will: (1) provide novel insights into the role of the early-
life metabolome and immunome in the pathogenesis of atopy and wheeze and (2) identify targets for disease
prevention. The proposal builds on the candidate's previous work, expertise, and interest in systems
approaches to understand disease development. The goal of this career development proposal is for the
candidate to emerge as an independent investigator in the field of asthma and allergy with unique knowledge
and application of systems approaches to understand disease mechanisms. The candidate is in an outstanding
academic environment, has a well thought out training and research plan, which will propel him into an
independent expert in the field of immuno-metabolism of atopy and asthma."

This NHLBI R01 proposal aims to launch an effectiveness-implementation hybrid randomized trial to adapt a
multi-faceted hypertension (HTN) management program shown to work in integrated healthcare delivery
systems to a safety net healthcare system (San Francisco Health Network). It is well known that racial/ethnic
minorities and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are significantly more likely to be diagnosed with
HTN as well as more likely to have uncontrolled hypertension. To improve HTN control – particularly during the
COVID-19 pandemic and beyond – there is a need for greater patient engagement in self-management in
everyday life, as well as improved patient-clinician communication about home blood pressure (BP) readings
and potential changes in anti-hypertensive medications. Previous trials have shown that digital technologies,
specifically home BP monitoring combined with enhanced digital patient-provider communication, significantly
improve BP control -- and these are critical for remote BP management for all patients during the pandemic.
However, disseminating these known best practices has proved challenging, particularly in safety net
healthcare settings that serve patients with the highest burden of chronic illness.
Despite high interest in using tools for digital healthcare communication, vulnerable patient populations are
currently less likely to use home BP monitoring devices and existing portal websites to communicate with their
healthcare providers and teams. Therefore, patient-provider communication interventions must include
training/support and patient activation as essential components of adapting digitally-based home BP
management programs into the safety net.
In Aim 1 of this study, we will offer patients with uncontrolled HTN in-person training to support their use of
home BP monitors, the online patient portal, and basics about text messaging and mobile phone applications.
We will examine pre-post training changes in technology use overall, as well as by specific patient subgroups
with known differences in technology uptake. In Aim 2 we will conduct a two-arm randomized clinical trial to
assess the effectiveness of enhanced digital communication (text messaging to remind/support and portal
messaging to develop action plans and remotely adjust anti-hypertensive medications) vs. usual care. Both
groups will receive a smart home BP monitor, and the primary outcome will be BP control at 12 months. In Aim
3 we will use a mixed methods approach to evaluate key implementation outcomes, guided by the RE-AIM
framework, of adapting this existing, evidence-based remote BP monitoring program."

The endgame for eliminating HIV will become increasingly difficult as transmission persists in
populations who are the most marginalized from society, the hardest to reach with prevention
programs, and the most challenging to include in epidemiological studies. Although San
Francisco appears on track to achieve zero new HIV infections within the next few years, the
trajectory among people who inject drugs (PWID) lags behind. The slower rate of decrease in
HIV among PWID may be due to lower levels of awareness and uptake of pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP). Meanwhile, neighboring Alameda County (home to Oakland) has seen little
decrease in the HIV epidemic, and outbreaks occur among PWID who are Black/African
American or experiencing homelessness. In addition to HIV, PWID in the US are experiencing a
surge in deaths due opioid overdose. To end the HIV epidemic and mitigate other health
disparities for PWID, data collection systems need to be more rapid, representative, and
responsive to this population at high risk. We therefore propose to create a new epidemiological
data collection system for PWID in Alameda and San Francisco counties called Brief
Longitudinal Incident Sentinel Surveillance (BLISS). We will recruit 600 PWID (300 each in
county) using a novel venue-based / peer-referral hybrid method called Starfish Sampling to
accrue a cohort and follow them longitudinally. Following HIV testing and a baseline
questionnaire, participants will be enlisted to provide monthly brief responses to 11 sentinel
events of high significance to the HIV and substance use epidemics (e.g., PrEP uptake or
discontinuation, harm reduction program utilization, overdose experiences). Monthly data will be
collected through smart phone and online technologies with in-person options as back up.
Selected sentinel events will trigger “deeper dive” data collection through ecological momentary
assessments (EMAs). The sample size is geared to detect events occurring at low rates in the
community as early warning signals and to obtain sufficient longitudinal data to assess causal
factors for HIV risk and preventive behaviors, particularly barriers and facilitators to PrEP use
and adherence. BLISS data will help identify and avert outbreaks, micro-target interventions,
prioritize those at highest risk, fill unmet care and prevention needs, and end the HIV epidemic."
10874793,"The most common age-associated optic nerve (ON)-related causes of vision loss are non-arteritic
anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Optic nerve head
(ONH) defects contribute to NAION and POAG susceptibility, but the mechanisms responsible for this are
incompletely understood, contributing to a lack of effective treatments. My lab recently discovered that the optic
nerve-laminar region (ONLR) within the ONH, contains a CNS neural stem cell/neural progenitor cell
(NSC/NPC) niche which is depleted during aging. Increased CNS-NPC activity has been shown to improve
baseline CNS activity in aged mice, and NPC depletion impedes CNS recovery following injury.
 NPCs secrete extracellular vesicles (‘exosomes’) that mediate many of the positive effects of CNS-
NPCs. We find that administering human ONLR-NPC-secreted exosomes enhance RGC survival ex vivo and
stimulates RGC-neuritigenesis. Depleting ONLR-NPCs in a mouse transgenic model increases markers of
RGC stress, using an RGC stress-marker panel. I hypothesize that ONLR-NPCs support RGC survival, and
they do this in part by vesicle secretion. I predict their loss increases RGC stress and susceptibility to death
after axonal ischemic stress, and supplementing RGCs with ONLR-NPC-extracellular vesicles will enhance
RGC survival after axonal stress. We will prove this with two rodent species and two specific aims.
 Specific aim 1: Demonstrate that mouse ONLR-NPC loss results in RGC stress and increases
RGC death in ON disease. We will couple a mouse transgenic model enabling selective ONLR-NPC
depletion, the rodent model of NAION rNAION model, and stereology (statistically robust cell quantification).
We will utilize molecular and cell biological techniques for identifying RGC cell stress and apoptosis. We will
then: A) Determine whether acute ONLR-NPC depletion results in RGC stress, via stress marker analysis and
B) Whether this depletion enhances RGC death after rNAION-induced RGC ischemic axonal stress. I predict
increased RGC stress, demonstrable by increased RGC-pJun expression and increased RGC loss.
 Specific aim 2. Confirm that rat ONLR-NPC ‘exosomes’ protect RGCs in culture and in vivo during
ischemic ON stress. We will isolate rat ONLR-NPC secreted vesicles and confirm their ability to enhance
RGC survival, by: A) Administering rat ONLR-NPC vesicles and their dissociated components to cultured rat
RGCs, we will quantify their ability to enhance RGC survival and neuritigenesis. I predict improved RGC
survival and increased neuritigenesis. B) Using the rNAION model, we will intravitreally inject rat ONLR-NPC
derived exosomes and their components and determine whether these vesicles improve RGC survival and
reduce stress-related markers such as CRF and pJun. I predict reduced stress levels and improved long-term
RGC survival. Our innovative approach will identify the factors that contribute to RGC stress resistance and
generate new, improved approaches to treatment of optic nerve diseases."
10874993,"Behavioral Intervention Development (BID) Core Abstract
The overall goal of our Midwest Roybal Center for Health Promotion and Translation is to
advance the science, translation, and practice of health promotion programs for older adults at
risk of AD/ADRD. The BID Core will enable us to achieve that goal by identifying talented
investigators and providing them with mentoring, support, and incentives that will enable them to
test impactful interventions. Interventions that we support will be highly feasible for immediate
translation and implementation into practice while advancing science in our areas of thematic
focus. Our thematic foci for this renewal application include: a. Develop and test principle driven
interventions to increase physical activity (PA) among older adults at risk of ADRD; b. Design
interventions to maintain and/or enhance cognitive function and mobility; c. Harness technology
to promote healthy cognitive aging and to improve the scalability of existing interventions for
cognitive health including PA, diet, and stress reduction; d. Target mechanisms of behavior
change (MOBC) to promote and sustain behavioral and lifestyle change. To achieve these aims,
we will issue annual calls for internal and external investigators to apply to a national
competition that will seek to identify the most promising, potent and scalable applications that
address these foci and have the potential to advance science in at least one of these areas. We
will require that all applications use and identify a MOBC and that the specific aims of each
application identify a hypothesized mechanism of action (MOA). Successful applications will be
required to have adequate statistical power to achieve interpretable results. The two proposed
Year One trials meet these criteria. Dr. Motl's Stage I trial extends his Life Light Physical Activity
(LPA) intervention that was tested with persons with Multiple Sclerosis to persons with
Parkinson's Disease (PD) who are at high risk for dementia. LPD combines Social Cognitive
Theory (SCT) counseling with PA that occurs while performing Activities of Daily Living.
Endpoints are step counts, improved cognitive function, and MR imaging. Dr. Aquinaga's Stage
II trial builds on her current trial of a combined dance and diet intervention for older Latinos who
are at high risk for AD/ADRD. Since evidence indicates a combination of aerobic and strength
exercises have the largest impact on cognition, she will test the benefit of adding strength
training to her existing intervention. Outcomes are executive function and multiple biomarkers.
MOA are changes in Insulin growth factor 1 and homocysteine levels produced by the strength
training. Both trials have anticipated pathways to advance through the NIH Stage Model stages."

Myopia or ‘nearsightedness’ is rapidly approaching pandemic levels worldwide. If left to the current trajectory,
it is predicted that half of the world will be myopic by 2050. It is critical we develop novel treatments to prevent
and treat the underlying causes of myopia rather than just correcting blurred vision caused by refractive error.
To do this, we need to understand refractive development programs at the cell and cell signaling levels. It is
known that refractive development intricately intertwines input from environmental visual stimuli, retinoscleral
signaling, and scleral remodeling. This proposal specifically focuses on the ultimate consequence of myopia,
scleral ECM remodeling by resident fibroblasts. I hypothesize that scleral fibroblasts follow a specific
developmental differentiation program that is disrupted following exposure to myopic stimuli, which results in
aberrant cellular signaling and responses. In aim one, I will use the mouse model to identify fibroblast
characteristics in eyes that successfully undergo refractive development resulting in no refractive error
(emmetropia). I will then directly compare the changes that occur in mice that have been exposed to myopic
stimuli. These myopigenesis models include lens-induced myopia (LIM), which uses a negatively powered
lens placed in the visual pathway to stimulate myopic eye growth. Furthermore, work from the Pardue and
Ethier labs has shown that feeding the biologically active metabolite of retinoic acid (RA) signaling, all-trans-
retinoic acid (atRA), to mice is sufficient to induce similar myopic changes in the sclera. This, paired with
data showing increases in RA metabolites in myopic retinas, suggests a role for RA signaling in driving
myopia. In aim two, I will determine the role of retinoic acid signaling in myopia. Independent of whether the
hypotheses laid out in the proposal are supported, the results of these studies will provide valuable
information to myopia and vision research communities. To perform these studies, I will need to develop
skills including measuring refractive error and axial length in vivo, performing imaging techniques such as
multiphoton microscopy techniques and RNA scope, and learning the background knowledge needed to do
research in an entirely new system, the eye. These skills will be critical as I pursue my long-term goal of
becoming an independent researcher at an academic institution."

An estimated 3% of the population will experience psychosis at some point in their lifetime, yet

knowledge, our lab created a mouse model in which region-specific functional knockout (FKO) of
the 14-3-3 protein family is achieved through the viral delivery of a small peptide inhibitor called
difopein. These 14-3-3 FKO mice display several phenotypes that are thought to correlate to
symptoms of psychosis, including novelty-induced locomotor hyperactivity. This phenotype was
further shown to be mediated by both hippocampal hyperactivity and overactive dopamine
signaling, leading to our recent discovery of a dorsal hippocampus CA1 (dCA1) – lateral septum
(LS) - ventral tegmental area (VTA) pathway. The goal of this project is to further characterize the
synaptic and functional connectivity of this neural circuitry: which cell types are connected, and
how neuronal excitability at each level of the circuit influences the observed phenotypes. Based
on our findings and the known organization of these brain regions, we hypothesize that the dCA1-
LS-VTA pathway is composed of a dCA1glutamate– LSGABA – VTAGABA – VTAdopamine circuit by which
14-3-3 inhibition induced CA1 hyperactivity ultimately leads to the dis-inhibition of VTA dopamine
neurons. Our first aim is to identify the synaptic connectivity within the dCA1-LS-VTA pathway,
and determine whether GABA or dopamine neurons in the VTA receive direct synaptic input from
LS GABA neurons. To do this we will use the viral-genetic tracing methods known as TRIO and
cTRIO in wildtype and transgenic mice. Our second aim is understand how signaling at each level
of this circuit functionally modulates downstream neural activity and psychosis-related
phenotypes. We will virally deliver inhibitory or excitatory chemogenetic channels that allow for
the manipulation of the neuronal activity of specific sets of neurons within the dCA1-LS-VTA
circuit. We will then measure the effect of these manipulations on novelty-induced locomotor
behavior and mesolimbic dopamine signaling. The proposed studies will allow for the deeper
understanding of a novel neural circuit that correlates to key symptoms of psychosis, contributing
valuable knowledge to the field that may be used in the development of more targeted treatments."
10902994,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Obesity is a growing public health crisis associated with life-threatening comorbidities
such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease. More than two-thirds of Americans are
overweight or obese, and one-sixth of children are obese. The economic impact associated with obesity is
substantial, costing approximately $300 billion annually in medical costs. Obesity is a complex disease involving
environmental, psychological, metabolic, and genetic factors. A class of genetic disorders that present with
severe obesity are ciliopathies due to disruptions to the cilia or ciliary genes. Mouse models of neuronal cilia
dysfunction cause hyperphagia-associated obesity as hunger and satiety signals that control feeding behavior
are regulated by neurons in the hypothalamus. Multiple G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) highly enriched in
neuronal cilia and involved in regulating energy homeostasis mislocalize in human and animal models of cilia-
associated obesity, indicating a critical role for ciliary signaling in the hypothalamic control of feeding behavior.
Understanding how ciliary signaling is involved in regulating feeding behavior and energy balance is integral to
developing new treatment strategies. Cilia, small microtubule projections emanating from almost every cell, are
critical signaling centers. Delineating ciliary signaling pathways in vivo is especially challenging with current
genetic models as loss of cilia ablates all ciliary signaling, while genetic deletion of ciliary proteins removes both
ciliary and cellular protein. Our lab genetically engineered a cilia-excluded mutant mouse, Arl13bV358A, where the
ARL13BV358A protein is excluded from the cilia but retains all its known functions. ARL13B is a regulatory GTPase
highly enriched in cilia and known for its role in ciliogenesis. Arl13bV358A/V358A mice are viable and fertile; they are
also hyperphagic and obese and display defects in glucose and insulin metabolism. Our findings identify that
ARL13B’s function within the cilia controls normal feeding behavior and that our cilia-excluded mouse model is
well suited to isolate ARL13B’s ciliary role in obesity. The long-term goal of this proposal is to dissect the cilia-
specific function of ARL13B as a regulator of energy homeostasis. I will test my central hypothesis that ciliary
ARL13B is required to regulate energy homeostasis. In Aim 1, I will determine the impact of ciliary ARL13B in
specific neuronal populations in regulating energy homeostasis. In Aim 2, I will test whether ciliary ARL13B in
the same neuronal populations is sufficient to regulate energy homeostasis. In Aim 3, I will investigate whether
ciliary ARL13B is continuously required by introducing ciliary ARL13B before and after the obesity phenotype.
Successful completion of these aims will (1) determine the ciliary contribution of ARL13B in specific neuronal
populations to regulate energy homeostasis and (2) delineate to what extent ciliary ARL13B can rescue and
reverse the obesity phenotype."

The common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, is a small New World non-human primate (NHP) with several practical
advantages that make it a valuable resource in biomedical research and neuroscience. Among all NHP species,
the marmoset is arguably the most suitable animal model for studies of aging and age-related diseases, including
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD). Marmosets are the shortest-lived anthropoid
primates. They have an average lifespan of 12-13 years, and some live past 15 years. This short lifespan allows
longitudinal studies in the same individuals over a reasonable period. They are considered “aged” at 8 years. In
support of their promise to become the premier NHP model of aging-related disorders, marmosets present age-
related pathological changes akin to those observed in humans, including chronic renal disease, cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, gastrointestinal disorders, cancer, and cerebral deposits of beta-Amyloid and alpha-synuclein.
Notably, the sequence coding Aβ is identical between human and marmoset. Marmosets also display age-related
weight loss, reduction in lean mass and calf circumference, macular degeneration, changes in the gut
microbiome, and progressive decrease of circulating blood factors such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, albumin,
and creatinine. Metabolic dysfunction has been a regular observation in aged, obese marmosets, suggesting
that marmosets display an age-dependent increase in insulin resistance similar to humans. All of these co-
morbidities in marmosets are relevant to the co-morbidities and risk factors of human AD. The Veterinary and
Colony Management Core (VCMC) is an essential Core of the Consortium entitled “Generation, Characterization,
and Validation of Marmoset Models of Alzheimer’s Disease (MARMO-AD). The VCMC will work with the Projects
and Cores of MARMO-AD to provide consistent, reliable animal care and research support services and promote
the health and welfare of all marmosets in the marmoset colony at the University of Pittsburgh. The VCMC
comprises a dedicated team of veterinary and husbandry staff that is led by an outstanding veterinarian, who is
capable of providing both standard and enhanced animal care. The VCMC breeding program ensures the
marmoset colony is self-sufficient and maintain its outbred status. The VCMC will support the MARMO-AD
Consortium by providing animal support to the investigators that include the acquisition of both fluid and tissue
samples for the Projects and Cores, specialized anesthesia monitoring, surgical support, including oocyte
collection and embryo transplantations, and the provision of post-surgical recovery and treatment of marmosets,
and the collection of samples during terminal procedures. The breeding program of the VCMC will ensure an
ongoing supply of animals for the Investigators of MARMO-AD. Lastly, the VCMC will curate the marmoset
biobank repository contents to ensure accurate record-keeping of all tissues and samples collected."
10899741,"PROJECT SUMMARY PROJECT 1
The overarching aims of this proposal are to identify the initial cascade of events that drive the inception and
progression of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). There is an urgent need to prevent, and treat AD. We hypothesize
that genetic risk for AD confers disease pathogenesis in early life that will be detected by studying molecular and
cellular events before the age of adolescence which will inform prevention. By employing a model system that
more faithfully recapitulates the genetic, molecular, cellular, physiological, anatomical and structural organization
of the primate brain, we will be able to identify underlying drivers of AD and better model disease pathogenesis
and progression in order to prevent disease. In support of these goals, this project (Project 1) aims to identify
the early life primate-specific molecular determinants of Alzheimer’s disease emergence and progression using
marmosets genetically engineered with the presenilin 1 (PSEN1) risk variant, an early onset AD mutation. The
PSEN1 marmoset models provide the ability to evaluate divergent changes at the molecular, cellular, and
systems level from birth through infancy, adolescence, and aging. The Specific Aims of this project are: 1) to
evaluate the disease trajectory of PSEN1 mutant marmosets relative to healthy age-matched and normal aged
controls using established and emerging AD biomarkers; 2) to conduct comprehensive behavioral
characterization of the PSEN1 marmoset models relative to healthy controls via longitudinal multimodal
phenotypic characterization from neurodevelopment through lifespan; and 3) investigate the molecular
signatures of neuronal cells derived from fibroblasts as a surrogate to brain. Through these specific aims, we
expect to have comprehensively characterized the first genetically engineered marmoset models of AD that
recapitulates the spectrum of AD-related phenotypes observed in AD patients for behavioral, cognitive,
biomarker, and neuropathological hallmarks using translational approaches; identified early molecular changes
at the cellular level using multi-omics approaches prior to the emergence of frank AD neuropathology and
cognitive decline; and created the foundation of knowledge for the utility of genetically engineered marmosets
with AD risk variants as validated models."
10899743,"PROJECT SUMMARY PROJECT 2
Determining the early molecular and cellular events in the origins and progression of late-onset Alzheimer’s
disease (LOAD) will require an analytical approach that integrates genetic, molecular, in vivo imaging, and
behavioral data. Many clinical studies with this goal are currently underway, which increasingly complement
genetic data with genome-scale molecular data from biofluids and post-mortem tissues, in vivo imaging data of
structure and neuropathology, and detailed cognitive data collected over disease progression. Transforming the
outcomes of these studies into targeted therapeutic strategies requires translatable animal model systems, both
for understanding the biological underpinnings of disease outcomes and preclinical efficacy testing of candidate
treatments.
The marmoset is potentially the most promising non-human primate model of LOAD, providing an analytical
bridge between human studies and high-capacity cell and rodent model systems. Laboratory marmosets with
outbred genetics can potentially provide a range of genotypic and phenotypic variation in relevant clinical
outcomes. This standing variation can be augmented by genetically engineering variants at specific risk loci, as
we have demonstrated with PSEN1. Phenotypic changes in multi-omic, imaging, cognitive, and cellular
outcomes can be rigorously studied in an aging primate with an intermediate lifespan. However, to date there
have not been systematic studies of aging marmosets at scale.
In this project, we will initiate these systematic studies through integrated analyses of genetics and LOAD-related
phenotypes in aging marmosets. We will then rigorously test correspondences between human and marmosets
at all biological levels, from genetic to multi-scale models. Our goal is to develop the marmoset into a mature
platform for preclinical research, which we will pursue with the following three aims: (1) assess natural genetic
variation in outbred marmosets as a model Alzheimer’s disease risk in humans; (2) integrate genetic, genomic,
and phenotype data to establish robust statistical models of disease in marmosets; and (3) evaluate disease
relevance of models by aligning molecular markers of Alzheimer’s disease in marmosets with human study
cohorts. Through this work, we expect to lay the foundations for LOAD-related functional genomics in
marmosets, provide an expanded view of the impact of natural genetic variation in laboratory marmosets,
prioritize genetic variants to engineer in marmosets, and create the first models of LOAD-related marmoset
pathology at multiple scales."

Project 3: Comparative Multimodal Phenotypic Characterization of Marmoset Models of AD
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder
affecting ~6 million Americans. Currently, there are no interventions capable of preventing, stopping, or treating
AD. The scarcity of adequate animal models that enable a comprehensive investigation of the pathogenic
mechanisms at play in AD has limited our progress towards discovering effective treatments. There is a critical
need for enhanced animal models that incorporate genetic variability, optimal lifespan to support age-related
research, superior compatibility as a model of human social and cognitive behavior, and the presentation of AD-
related pathology. The central premise of our Consortium “Generation, Characterization, and Validation of
Marmoset Models of Alzheimer’s Disease” (MARMO-AD) is that the marmoset will reveal the earliest primate-
specific cellular and molecular root causes of AD pathogenesis and progression. We postulate that marmosets
engineered to harbor genetic risk variants for early- (EOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD) will reveal clinical disease
trajectories that model those of human AD patients and display primate-specific disease pathogenesis that can
be detected with a comprehensive phenotypic characterization pipeline. We hypothesize that: (1) the
comprehensive assessment of genetic, molecular, functional, behavioral, and pathological phenotypes in
marmosets will provide translatable knowledge of the origins and progression of AD in human populations; and
(2) the comparative, longitudinal study of the marmoset LOAD model against the EOAD models and healthy
controls will identify emerging phenotypes that precede frank neuropathology and prioritize tractable targets for
future therapeutic discovery. The ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 7 (ABCA7) gene was identified
by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as having one of the highest odds ratios for developing LOAD in
humans. In this project, we will create a novel genetically engineered marmoset LOAD model incorporating an
ABCA7 LOAD variant. Once these animals are born, we will follow them longitudinally to identify emerging
phenotypes that deviate from healthy aging ahead of the appearance of frank neuropathology. We will evaluate
non-carrier healthy control marmosets to characterize the typical healthy aging trajectory across the lifespan and
establish a baseline against which we can contrast our marmoset models of LOAD and EOAD. We will then
evaluate the disease trajectory of the ABCA7 marmoset LOAD model relative to the PSEN1 EOAD models via
longitudinal, multimodal phenotypic characterization in line with the clinical staging of AD patients. By contrasting
our marmoset models of EOAD and LOAD, we hope to identify differential biomarkers of LOAD that can be
measured ahead of the emergence of frank neuropathology and prioritize novel targets for therapeutic
development. Upon validation of these unique primate AD models, we plan to expand the colony and share this
precious resource with the greater AD research community to help accelerate the pace of bringing novel and
effective treatments to patients."

External factors including insurance coverage, patient-clinician relationships, and healthcare policies limit
personalized uterine fibroid (UF) care and shared decision-making for women. These factors are magnified for
Black/African American (BAA) women secondary to distrust between medical providers, and specifically
gynecologists and BAA contributing to a situation whereby women generally desire uterine sparing procedures
while nearly 60% of women undergo hysterectomy without prior conservative therapy. This project seeks to
understand the external factors contributing to barriers to wider use of conservative nonsurgical treatment
options that have widespread endorsement of their safety and efficacy. The specific aims are to 1) analyze
predictors of UF treatment adoption and outcomes in BAA and White women in a large commercially insured
population and assess the impact of Medicaid expansion on access to UF treatments and outcomes
specifically focusing on disparities between BAA and White women; 2) assess via focus groups non-
gynecologic and gynecologic providers’ knowledge, standard of treatment, and comfort with approaches when
providing care to patients for the treatment of UF; 3) conduct a discrete choice experiment to understand
provider preferences for treatment options. Since healthcare decisions are primarily influenced by healthcare
providers that vary on context, barriers identified will be utilized to decrease disparities in offering medical and
uterine sparing therapies. Through dissemination of the findings and collaboration with the administrative
corps, pilot projects will be supported to bring diverse early-stage investigators into the fields of policy and
research to empower personalized and evidence-based decision making.

This proposed research aims to provide a roadmap for studying dopamine dynamics using a novel optical tool,
dLight, deepening our understanding of dopamine biology. Altered dopamine signaling is central to many
neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, yet we lack effective treatments for these disorders. Many existing
treatments act on dopaminergic systems, but they act on slow time scales and do not work for all patients.
Deepening our fundamental understanding of dopamine biology can lead to the discovery of improved
treatments. The Tian lab developed dLight, which is an optical biosensor that can directly record dopamine
signaling in vivo with high precision. The proposed work aims to determine the performance metrics of the newest
dLight variants in vivo and use the sensor to measure alterations in dopamine activity in a disease model.
Specifically, I will measure differences in dopamine signaling between offspring of the maternal immune
activation model and healthy controls, as offspring from this model have been shown to have altered dopamine
signaling systems. Additionally, I will create a database of the data collected to share with the neuroscience
research community, increasing the accessibility of dLight and enabling researchers to use this novel tool in their
own research. Successful completion of this project has the potential to transform our understanding of dopamine
biology and significantly contribute to the development of effective treatments for many neurological and

10901434,"Blood flows through a well-organized network of vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries) to allow proper nutrient
and oxygen exchange throughout the body. In Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT), blood vessel
organization becomes disrupted, resulting in the formation of localized, enlarged direct connections between
arteries and veins (arteriovenous malformations, AVMs) that bypass the normal capillary bed in major organs or
entangled vessels (telangiectasias) at the skin and mucosa. These malformations can rupture and bleed into the
surrounding area, and people with HHT often experience nosebleeds, anemia, stroke, and even death. HHT
occurs in individuals with pathogenic variants of three major components of Transforming growth factor beta
(TGF-β) signaling - Smad-related protein 4 (SMAD4, JP-HHT), Endoglin (ENG, HHT1), or Activin receptor-like
kinase-1 (ALK1, HHT2). While these germline-inactivating mutations are systemic, AVM formation is localized
to major organs such as the brain, lungs, and liver. This leads us to wonder whether focal second hits, such as
random somatic mutations or wounds, could lead to complete loss of function (loss of heterozygosity, LOH) and
initiate AVM formation in a certain area. It was recently shown that some telangiectasias in HHT patients consist
of cells with both mono-allelic and bi-allelic loss, which supports this idea of LOH. This project aims to develop
an HHT mouse model of Smad4 LOH, compare it to previous Smad4 homozygous inducible knockout models,
and explore the role of LOH in AVM formation in HHT. My central hypothesis is that i) the LOH model will
offer a better alternative for studying the impact of second hits on HHT pathology and ii) localized,
mosaic loss of function mutations lead to LOH-ECs influencing surrounding non-LOH ECs to initiate
AVM formation. I will test this through two major aims that: 1) fully compare the Smad4 LOH model to the
previous model and 2) evaluate the influence of Smad4 LOH on nearby cells and overall AVM formation.
Exploring the role of LOH is a novel approach in HHT, as previous studies have focused solely on heterozygous
or complete knockout but were lacking uniform heterozygosity coupled with localized complete loss of function.
This project offers the potential to better represent HHT patients and further explore the pathobiology of this rare
disease. Through this project, I will grow into a more independent scientist by developing my research
communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. I will learn how to effectively design experiments,
trouble shoot, and incorporate new, cutting-edge techniques such as spatial transcriptomics. From this training,
I will develop the skills necessary to fulfill my immediate goal of working as a post doctorate in a neurovascular

Targeting and functional specificity of synapses rely on a complicated network of protein interactions. Trans-
synaptic adhesion through cell surface proteins is one type of protein interaction that is required for synapse
formation. Neurons express multiple synaptic cell surface proteins but little is known about how they interact with
one another. This is important because many neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with altered surface
protein expression. Kirrel3 is a cell surface and synaptic adhesion protein from the immunoglobulin superfamily
and Kirrel3 is necessary to form mossy fiber filopodia synapses that connect dentate gyrus neurons to
GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus. To elucidate the mechanism of Kirrel3 function at this synapse, I
conducted a proteomic screen to identify Kirrel3 binding partners. One protein I identified is another Ig
superfamily member called IgSF8. IgSF8 was also shown to be necessary for mossy fiber filopodia formation
but how Kirrel3 and IgSF8 work together in constructing this synapse is unknown. In two aims, I will determine
how Kirrel3 and IgSF8 physically interact and if the synaptogenic function of Kirrel3 depends on IgSF8. My
results will advance the understanding of mechanisms by which synaptic specificity is achieved and given that
Kirrel3 variants have been identified as risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders, my results have potential
to address a cellular foundation contributing to human disease."
10904570,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over the past two decades, neuroimaging studies of human episodic memory have established that
remembering an event from the past involves reactivation of activity patterns initially evoked during the
perceptual experience of that event. Indeed, reactivation has proven to be an incredibly valuable tool for studying
episodic memory as it, in turn, has been related to many behavioral expressions of memory. Yet, whereas
reactivation, by definition, is a measure of the similarity between perceptual and memory representations, there
is recent and accumulating evidence for systematic differences in how—or where—perceptual representations
and memory representations are expressed. At present, these systematic differences between perception and
memory are not well understood and there are many fundamental, open questions concerning the functional
significance of these differences and how to reconcile these differences with the phenomenon of reactivation.
The conceptual idea guiding the current proposal is that memory representations can be formally described as
transformed versions of perceptual experience. In our first aim, we will use innovative fMRI methods to learn
transformation functions describing the relationship between perceptual and memory representations. More
specifically, by measuring perceptual representations in sensory cortex, we will attempt to predict subsequent
expressions of memory in different brain regions (parietal cortex). In aim 2, we will use a combination of natural
language processing algorithms, image processing techniques, and voxel-wise encoding models to rigorously
characterize information content in neural expressions of memory. This will allow us to characterize how
information content changes with perception-to-memory transformations and whether transformation or
reactivation better predict behavioral expressions of memory. In aim 3, we will test whether perception-to-
memory transformations represent a more general example of transformation from external-to-internal
representations. Specifically, we will compare perceptual representations with representations during episodic
recall (of the past), episodic simulation (of the future), and working memory maintenance. The long-term goal of
this program of research is to better understand how memories are expressed in the brain. This goal has broad
relevance to basic science and health. While neuroimaging studies of reactivation have substantially advanced
the field, there is an opportunity for further advance by understanding how, why, and when perception-to-memory
transformations occur."

The often debilitating side-effect of standard pharmacotherapy for Parkinson disease (PD), levodopa-induced
dyskinesia (LID) continues to be a serious complication of medical treatment for individuals with PD. Despite
eventually occurring in greater than 90% of individuals, there is the only one FDA-approved drug for LID.
However, it is only partially effective, works best in cases of mild LID, and can itself produce significant adverse
events. Maintaining the motor benefits of PD therapies while avoiding LID remains a significant unmet clinical
need. Our research program has been validating striatal voltage gated CaV1.3 calcium channels as a
therapeutic target for LID amelioration. Our initial proof-of-principle data demonstrated that reducing striatal
CaV1.3 expression with adeno-associated virus (rAAV) CaV1.3 short-hairpin (sh)RNA expression in YOUNG
(2mo) MALE parkinsonian rats provided near complete, uniform protection against LID induction, and provided
significant (60%) reversal of already established severe LID. Importantly this approach did NOT interfere with,
and in fact appeared to enhance, motor activation of levodopa. As age is the greatest risk factor for PD and
that there are sex-related differences in both PD and LID, in the first iteration of this R01 we expanded our
target validation studies into older male and female parkinsonian rats and nonhuman primates (NHPs). For
these studies, we principally employed the proactive approach of preventing LID induction, reasoning that if
aging precluded, or significantly diminished the ability of this molecular therapy to ameliorate LID severity, a
proactive paradigm was the most reasonable initial approach. Using a mix of proactive (rat & NHP) and
reversibility paradigms (rat only), our studies performed during the first iteration of this award continue to
robustly support the concept that striatal CaV1.3 silencing is a potent therapeutic for preventing LID induction
(rats & NHPs) and escalation of pre-existing mild LID (rats) in aging parkinsonian subjects of both sexes.
However, these studies provide crucial scientific insight that advancing age, female sex, and introducing
CaV1.3 silencing after LID induction in older parkinsonian rats (15-18 mos) increased variability and
decreased overall benefit of therapeutic response. In contrast, in aged parkinsonian NHPs (24-29 yo)
proactive intervention with AAV-CaV1.3-shRNA provided profound antidyskinetic benefit and significant
diminution of long-standing severe parkinsonian disability, ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ levodopa, in both male and female
aged macaques. We posit the next logical steps for this research program, aimed at understanding the
potential clinical application of this gene therapy in PD, is to define the therapeutic benefit (i.e., reversal of LID
and parkinsonian disability) once LID have been induced using the gold standard preclinical parkinsonian NHP
model. We propose here a series of studies directed at determining the capacity and/or limitations of reversing
established LID and long-standing parkinsonian disability, modeling therapeutic efficacy of CaV1.3 silencing in
two demographics of PD, specifically in those with idiopathic PD and those with young onset PD (YOPD)."

disease. This K23 award will provide the mentored career development needed to gain in-depth expertise in
study design, statistics (culminating in a Master’s of Science in Clinical Research), image analysis (though
coursework and mentorship), and professional development. Glaucoma develops in more than one quarter
of children with congenital cataracts in the 5 years following cataract surgery. Several structural risk factors
for glaucoma following congenital cataract surgery (GFCCS) have been established including age, corneal
size, and anatomic abnormalities of the sclera and ciliary body. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) has
potential to revolutionize our understanding of these structural risk factors and many more. A critical gap in
the field is our inability to utilize pre-operative data to anticipate GFCCS, to provide accurate personalized
prognosis and earlier diagnosis and treatment. My overall goal is to determine the contribution of structural
anatomy in the risk of GFCCS and offer clinicians a predictive risk profile for GFCCS at the time of cataract
surgery (prior to disease onset) based on anterior segment structural features determined from UBM
images. I hypothesize the structural risk factors (biomarkers) identified in pre-operative UBM images will
reflect structural immaturity and correlate with GFCCS. We will test this hypothesis with the following Aims:
1) We will determine baseline quantitative structural characteristics among healthy subjects age 0-5 years
using UBM images, 2) We will determine structural characteristics among subjects age 0-5 years with
cataracts, to compare the cataract cohort to age-matched controls. The cataract cohort will be followed
longitudinally to determine the structural biomarkers that correlate with development of GFCCS. My training
efforts parallel these Aims and focus on gaining expertise in clinical research, biostatistics, image analysis,
and professional development. In addition to didactic coursework, I will benefit from the close mentorship of
Drs. Steven Bernstein and Bennie Jeng, and established leaders in each area of my intended expertise.
The current study is important because identification of the specific measurable structural risk factors
associated with GFCCS will aid clinicians in diagnosis and provide an immediate high yield potential target
for treatment and prevention. Clinicians will identify structural features from UBM performed prior to cataract
surgery to quantify risk for development of glaucoma. The results of the proposed research will provide the
foundation for a future study examining interventions based on structural biomarkers for GFCCS. The
ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative diagnostic tools to enhance clinical care for pediatric
patients with anterior segment disease, leading to improved treatments and reduced childhood blindness."
10880723,"We propose a whole person-centered approach for the development of artificial pancreas devices (AP) that
automates insulin delivery for adolescents and young adults with type-1 diabetes. The proposed approach
will enhance existing AP devices by means of ""smart nudges"" based on real-time indicators of planned and
ongoing activity, cognitive load, and psychosocial measures like mood and stress. These nudges will help
individuals with type 1 diabetes adapt their behaviors such as meals, physical activity and insulin bolusing
to the AP device in order to maintain their blood glucose levels inside a tight ""euglycemic"" range while
avoiding adverse events linked to extremely low and high blood glucose levels. Our proposed person-
centered artificial pancreas (PCAP) approach will enhance existing control systems to reflect more
nuanced understandings of users’ physiological, cognitive, psychosocial, and behavioral states and support
users’ lived experiences of managing chronic conditions in continuous collaboration with assistive devices.
Using real-time data on the physiological state (blood glucose, heart-rate, physical activity, and illness);
behavioral data from user interactions with the device; and measures of cognitive load, stress, attention
and trust obtained through carefully designed short questionnaires, PCAP will build whole person models
that track mental states including situational awareness, cognitive load, attention, and stress in order to
predict future behaviors. These models will be used by a decision-making algorithm to determine the
parameters for a nudge, including content, importance and frequency. Our multidiscplinary team will also
investigate the design of a user-interface for delivering these nudges and tracking the user response to
them. A series of feasibility/preclinical user studies involving adolescents are proposed in order to evaluate
the correctness, reliability, and efficacy of the proposed PCAP system. Important longer-term issues
surrounding trust and privacy will be carefully investigated to inform the design of PCAP. The proposed
multicomponent cognitive models will incorporate ideas from a variety of fields including human–computer
interaction, psychology, mobile systems, probabilistic modeling, inference, learning and control, with a
particular focus on establishing an empirical basis for effective patient ""nudging"" to improve diabetes self-
management without increasing workload or drawing undue attention to the patient’s condition. While the
focus of the project is on the treatment of type-1 diabetes, the proposed fundamental techniques will extend
to the management of other chronic conditions where the integration of wearable sensors and mobile
devices as part of multicomponent interventions can also guide the adoption and maintenance of healthy
behaviors. The proposed research will also investigate important aspects of user privacy and ethical
considerations in assistive medical devices like PCAP, given the possibility of these devices to infer
intimate private details about their users’ lives.

10902513,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 30% of human genes encode proteins in the secretory pathway, highlighting its central role in
numerous cellular functions, including cellular homeostasis, growth, and development. The secretory pathway
controls immunity, metabolism, neurotransmission, tissue integrity, and cellular communication in a multicellular
organism. Consequently, it is at the heart of many human diseases, including neurological diseases such as
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and cystic fibrosis, and behavioral disorders like autism and schizophrenia linked to
disruptions in the secretory pathway. Furthermore, conditions including cancer, obesity, and endocrine
diseases, most notably diabetes, are intricately tied to the proper functioning of this pathway.
The Protein Processing, Trafficking, and Secretion GRC will offer topics to synergize the cell biology of protein
transport with disease pathology, including the following topics: Protein folding and misfolding in the ER,
signaling in the secretory pathway, lipid trafficking, targeted protein degradation, EM-tomography of the secretory
pathway, unconventional protein secretion, biomolecular condensation, neurological disorders, autophagy, and
modern aspects of the cell biology and pathology of diabetes. The unique combination of topics paired with
lectures about novel high-end technologies will fill a crucial gap in the scientific landscape that may promote the
therapeutic targeting of these diseases.
The conference strongly emphasizes the inclusion of trainees and demonstrates exceptional commitment to
their participation. In 2022, 55% of the attendees were students and postdocs (compared to the GRC average
of 41%), while only 27% were full professors. Another focus will be on diversity and inclusion to further build
on substantial efforts since 2018. The 2022 conference witnessed a balanced gender ratio, with 48.5% female
and 51.49% male attendees (compared to 36% female in 2018). In the 2024 conference, our confirmed speakers
will comprise 37% women and 7% individuals from underrepresented groups (African American and Hispanic
American). We have set up a strategic plan to increase these numbers by 17 reserved speaker slots for
short presentations selected from submitted abstracts, prioritizing trainees, investigators from underrepresented
groups, and early-stage researchers. The conference venue is Colby Sawyer College in New London, NH. It
provides excellent facilities for a low cost. The venue is a pleasant environment free from the distractions of an
urban setting, providing ample time and space for informal interactions. Historically, this has resulted in
numerous collaborations and extensive networking. For young scientists, this leads to valuable career-long
relationships."
10902643,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Birth defects are the primary cause of infant mortality in the United States, affecting twenty percent of total infant
deaths. Thus, comprehensive insights into the intricate regulation of human development are essential to devise
innovative therapies and prevention strategies to combat birth defects. During embryonic development, a
complex interplay of signaling pathways, effector molecules, and chromatin regulators work together to regulate
lineage-specific gene expression during cell-fate transitions. Gastrulation is required for normal development
and leads to the specification of the three germinal layers; mesoderm, ectoderm, and endoderm. While rare,
disruptions or errors during gastrulation can lead to improper formation of tissues and organs in the developing
fetus. One of the first cell types specified during gastrulation is the blood cell precursors called hemangioblasts,
which derive from the primitive streak (PS). Defects in hemangioblast formation cause disruptions in the normal
development of blood cells, leading to various vascular and hematological disorders. Extensive literature has
shown the cellular mechanisms that determine primitive hematopoietic cells; however, how these precursor cells
are specified during the early stages of PS is understudied. The scientific premise of this proposal is based upon
the repressive transcriptional role of the Hippo signaling effector, Yes-associated Protein 1 (YAP1), on
hemangioblast formation. YAP1 is a known transcriptional effector involved in the Hippo signaling pathway that
has been widely studied for its transcriptional activity in regulating cell growth and proliferation. Our preliminary
data suggest a novel regulatory mechanism of YAP1 mediating the recruitment of Enhancer of zeste homolog 2
(EZH2) to blood lineage genes during hemangioblast formation. Based on these observations, our central
hypothesis is that “YAP1-mediated recruitment of EZH2 on blood lineage genes restrict hemangioblast cell
specification.” We will test our central hypothesis by conducting experiments organized under the following two
specific aims: Aim 1: To investigate the role of YAP1 in hemangioblast formation and primitive streak patterning
at single-cell resolution in vivo and Aim 2. Molecular analysis of YAP1-mediated regulation of blood lineage
genes in hESCs. The proposed studies are significant as they highlight the essential role of YAP1 and EZH2
coordination during blood development. The proposal aims to enhance both technical (single-cell omics and
next-generation sequencing) and conceptual skills in signaling and chromatin dynamics during early
development; this will help promote my Ph.D. training and overall career."
10902645,"PROJECT SUMMMARY:
Antibiotics are essential medicines to treat bacterial infections. Many broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as
oral ciprofloxacin, are commonly prescribed to treat many gastrointestinal infections. Antibiotics also affect
the microbiota by altering its diversity and function and sometimes promoting dysbiosis. Although previous
studies implied that some beneficial microbes, such as Lactobacilli, have preexisting resistance to various
antibiotics, it is still unclear how commonly prescribed oral antibiotics, like ciprofloxacin, selects for
Lactobacilli species. This proposal addresses this knowledge gap by first examining the effect of
ciprofloxacin exposure in Lactobacilli species. In Aim 1, we will examine the effects of oral ciprofloxacin on
the microbiota by identifying changes in the bacterial taxa from ileum and fecal contents through 16SrRNA
sequencing and assess the Lactobacilli abundance by qPCR. Then, we will examine the resistance
phenotype to ciprofloxacin of different Lactobacilli species using colony forming units and population
analysis profile assays. Our preliminary data suggests that Lactobacillus relative abundance increases
during ciprofloxacin treatment. Additionally, preliminary in vitro data implies that Lactobacillus tends to have
preexisting resistance to ciprofloxacin. Although studies have demonstrated that antibiotics affect the
microbiota and host immune responses, it is still unclear how oral ciprofloxacin alters Lactobacillus species
which affect the regulatory immune response. Foxp3+ Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and intraepithelial
lymphocytes (IELs) are known for their immunoregulatory functions. These cells mediate tolerance against
various stimuli, such as nutrients and microbiota, via anti-inflammatory cytokine expression, like IL-10. Many
beneficial microbes induce Tregs and other IL-10-producing cells. Lactobacillus has been shown to influence
the development of IELs. Additionally, previous studies using antibiotic cocktails have shown that IL-10
production from colonic regulatory T cells decrease during treatment. However, it is still unknown if
ciprofloxacin-selected Lactobacilli induces IL-10 production in IELs, especially in the small intestine. In Aim
2, we will examine the changes in IL-10 production of intestinal T cells during ciprofloxacin treatment by
treating IL-10 reporter mice with ciprofloxacin. Our preliminary flow cytometry data suggests that
ciprofloxacin treatment increases IL-10 production in IELs. Furthermore, preliminary in vitro data suggested
that Lactobacillus induces IL-10 production from macrophages. Therefore, Lactobacillus could also promote
IL-10 production in IELs during ciprofloxacin treatment. Overall, this project will assess how ciprofloxacin
selects for Lactobacillus species that promote IL-10 production in the small intestine. In addition, this work
will provide insight on how commonly prescribed antibiotics affect the microbiota and intestinal regulatory
immune system."

10899542,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Accumulating evidence indicates that infections with a newly-discovered species of rhinovirus, RV-C, are asso-
ciated with severe respiratory tract infections and asthma exacerbations often requiring hospitalization. In addi-
tion, recent data suggest a possible role for early-life RV-C infections in asthma development.
 Despite increasing recognition of RV-C as a cause of asthmatic disease, virtually nothing is known about
the pathogenesis of RV-C infections. To accomplish this, we infected mice with RV-C15 (the RV-C15 infec-
tious clone and HeLa-E8 cells overexpressing a variant of the human RV-C receptor, cadherin related family
member 3, were obtained from James Gern, University of Wisconsin). Our pilot studies show that RV-C15-
infected mice show increased type 2 cytokine and mucin gene expression, BAL eosinophils and lineage-nega-
tive, CD25+, CD127+ type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) compared to RV-A1B-infected mice. In addition, pi-
lot studies from children with natural RV-C infections show increased type 2 cytokine production.
 In this application, we will test the general hypothesis that, after RV-C infection, airway innate cytokine ex-
pression drives ILC2 expansion and development of eosinophilic inflammation and mucous metaplasia. To test
this hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims:
 Specific Aim 1. Determine the contribution of epithelial-derived innate cytokines to RV-C15-induced
eosinophilic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness (AHR). We hypothesize that: 1) compared to
RV-A, RV-C infection of mature mice induces greater lung expression of innate cytokines (IL-25, IL-33, TSLP);
2) IL-25 is produced by doublecortin-like kinase (DCLK)-1-positive airway tuft cells; 3) innate cytokines are re-
quired for eosinophilic inflammation; 4) RV-C engagement of CDHR3 activates distinct signaling pathways
leading to innate cytokine expression.
 Specific Aim 2. Determine the contribution of lung ILC2s and macrophages to RV-C-induced airway
inflammation and AHR. We hypothesize that: 1) RV-C infection of mature mice induces innate cytokine-de-
pendent expansion of ILC2s; 2) ILC2s promote eosinophilic inflammation, macrophage polarization and AHR;
3) house dust mite (HDM) and RV-C have additive effects on eosinophilic inflammation and AHR; 4) ILC2s
convey corticosteroid resistance; and 5) nasal aspirates from human subjects infected with RV-C show in-
creased expression of type 2 cytokines and ILC2s compared to samples from RV-A-infected subjects.
 Specific Aim 3. Determine the effects of early-life RV-C infection on the established asthma pheno-
type. We have found that RV-A1B infection of six day-old mice, but not mature mice, induces long-lasting mu-
cous metaplasia and AHR which is dependent on IL-13-producing ILC2s. We hypothesize that: 1) RV-C infec-
tion of 6 day-old mice induces greater and more long-lasting mucous metaplasia than RV-A; 2) early-life RV-C
infection increases the number of IL-25-producing airway tuft cells."
10898435,"Salmonella Typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever, is a neglected tropical disease that
spreads through contaminated food and water. Recent environmental surveillance studies from
Bangladesh and Nepal have found that prevalence of Typhi-specific bacteriophages in
wastewater correlated with the burden of typhoid fever in the community. Preliminary studies
from our group have uncovered that different genotypes of Salmonella Typhi have differing
phage susceptibility. Three of the most commonly circulating genotypes in Bangladesh (4.3.1.1,
3.3.2 and 4.3.1.3. Bdq) exhibit high phage resistance, suggesting a link between phage
resistance and the fitness and spread of Salmonella Typhi. Genomic analysis identified that
4.3.1.3. Bdq possesses the BREX anti-phage defense system, but no known phage defense
systems could be identified in genotypes 4.3.1.1 and 3.3.2. In the proposed study, we want to
use genetic, molecular, and biochemical methods to dissect the interaction between
bacteriophages and different strains of Salmonella Typhi to a) identify the molecular factors
that dictate Salmonella Typhi and phage interactions, and b) investigate how these factors
change over time in both the bacteria and phages. We also propose a longitudinal observational
study to identify prevalence of Typhi-specific phages in the human gut and their correlation
with typhoid fever. Taken together, this study will shed light on the role phages play in dictating
the spread and evolution of an important, but often, neglected infectious disease."

Latino immigrants experience health inequities that are heightened over time and across generations. In fact,
the syndemic (conditions that cluster among marginalized groups) comprised of substance use, intimate
partner violence (IPV), risk for HIV, and mental health conditions has been found to increase among Latino
immigrants over time and higher levels of US acculturation. Acculturative stress, the stress associated with
being a Latino immigrant and acculturating to the US, is the most robust predictor of this syndemic and the
impact these stressors have on family level dynamics (e.g., marital stress, acculturation gaps) are particularly
harmful. Latino immigrant families have multiple sources of resilience that allow them to resist, recover, and
rebound from this stress. These include individual active coping, optimisim in the American Dream, and a
positive ethnic identity; family support, parental monitoring and positive parent-child communications; and
community social support and access to social and health resources. This application aims to prevent
syndemic health conditions by decreasing acculturative stress and promoting resilience via SER Familia
(Salud, Estrés y Resilencia en Familias/ Health, Stress, and Resilience in Families), a family-based
intervention informed by our observational (SER Hispano; R01MD012249) and pilot studies. SER Familia is a
six-session intervention co-developed and delivered by community health workers (CHWs) that uses strategies
to reduce acculturative stress, promote resilience, improve parent-child and family level health, while
simultaneously helping families maintain strong social networks and better navigate community resources to
address social determinants of health (SDOH). More specifically we aim to: 1) Examine the efficacy of SER
Familia to prevent or reduce the syndemic comprised of substance abuse, IPV, HIV risk, depression, and
anxiety among Parents and Youth; and 2) Identify how individual, family, and community mechanisms of
change related to acculturative stress and resilience mediates the effect of SER Familia. We will carry out a
community-engaged, mixed-methods, randomized controlled trial with 380 Latino immigrant families to
determine the impact of SER Familia compared to a delayed intervention condition. Data from surveys using
culturally specific measures of acculturative stress, resilience, and syndemic outcomes collected at baseline,
immediately after the intervention, and 6 and 12 month follow-up periods from Parent and Youth dyads will be
integrated with interviews with a sub-set of dyads randomized to the SER Familia (n=20) to generate a
comprehensive understanding of the impact and mechanisms of the intervention. Our long-term goal is to
develop scalable interventions that prevent syndemics and employ multi-level approaches to address
acculturative stress and resilience among Latino immigrants in the US. The findings from this study will help
identify strategies to promote health for Latino families, the largest minoritized group in the US."
10899730,"Abstract: Despite the advances in understanding its genomic and molecular basis, prostate cancer (PCa)
remains the most commonly diagnosed solid malignancy in men in the US and the second leading cause of cancer
death. Currently, the only established method to diagnose PCa is an invasive transrectal ultrasound prostate
biopsy. The majority (>66%) of biopsies show benign pathology at the expense of patient morbidity and
healthcare dollars. There remains, therefore, an unmet need for a simple and non-invasive approach that will
definitively diagnose PCa, determine if it is aggressive, indolent or benign and help guide its management.
The era of molecular profiling has drawn much attention to genomic analysis of malignant PCa cells shed in blood
and urine. In two such assays, the PCA3 and SelectMDx approved by FDA, urine is collected after DRE, malignant
cells isolated and characterized by multiplex genomic finger prints of PCa. Although innovative, PCA3 test is not
widely used, primarily due to its wide range (62%-94%) of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive (PPV) and
negative predictive value (NPV). Furthermore, the clinical utility of SelectMDx and a frequently advocated serum
4Kscore test, remains uncertain.
 There is robust literature demonstrating that VPAC receptors are expressed on PCa cells. With NIH/NCI
support, we designed and labeled a VPAC specific peptide with Cu-64 that allowed us to image PCa successfully in
humans. We then hypothesized that PCa cells, shed in voided urine of PCa patients, without prostate stimulation
by DRE, can be imaged optically by targeting VPAC receptors, using the same peptide labeled with a
fluorophore. Our preliminary results of >250 de-identified urine samples, collected from patients with PCa, BPH
and normal cases, are encouraging (sensitivity >98%) and are consistent with our hypothesis. In this investigation
we propose to obtain critical information that will be required for the development of this promising noninvasive
urine assay as a PCa diagnostic test. Our specific aims are 1) To determine sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the molecular urinary assay for men with known
PCa and negative controls; 2) To examine the efficacy of the assay in the management of patients with
previous negative biopsy for PCa but have persistently elevated PSA and are scheduled for TRUS biopsy;
3) To establish if a) the malignant cells as a percent of total cells shed in the urine, b) the fluorescence
intensity around malignant cells, and c) the VPAC protein quantity in shed malignant cells correlate with
the aggressiveness of the disease; 4) To assess the role of this molecular urine assay in the management
patients on active surveillance; and 5) To determine if a preservative is required for urine storage. This
simple, reliable and patient-friendly uniplex assay will a) detect active, aggressive or indolent PCa, b) save patients
from over diagnosis and over treatment, c) reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and associated patient
morbidity, and d) save millions of healthcare dollars."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting the lives of more than 5
million Americans and their families and is the biggest forthcoming health challenge. AD is a multifactorial
disorder manifested clinically by progressive memory loss, decline in cognitive functions and ultimately leading
to dementia. Despite being the subject of intense research, there is no cure for AD, therefore, identifying
therapies that can reduce disease progression at early stages is critical.
 Circadian impairment is a major feature of Alzheimer’s disease. Behavioral circadian alterations, known as
sundowning, are experienced by more than 80% of patients and represent the leading factor for hospitalization
and nursing home placement in AD. New research suggests that circadian disruption occurs early during
disease progression and contributes to neurodegeneration. Since circadian rhythms regulate multiple systems
in the human body coordinating physiology with the environment, alterations in this system have a profound
impact on health, behavior, sleep, and cognition. The proposed work will conduct a preliminary investigation on
the beneficial effects of regulating the time of food intake to improve circadian function, on cognition and
disease markers in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or AD patients.
 One of the most powerful regulators of the circadian system is the daily feed/fast cycle. We recently
demonstrated that time-restricted feeding (TRF) improves key disease components including memory, sleep,
behavior, disease pathology, and brain transcription in mouse models of AD. Notably, we found that TRF had
the remarkable capability of simultaneously reducing amyloid deposition, increasing Aβ42 clearance, improving
sleep and hyperactivity, and normalizing transcription of circadian, AD, and neuroinflammation-associated
genes in AD mice. Thus, our study unveiled for the first time that circadian modulation through timed feeding
has far-reaching effects beyond metabolism and affects the brain as the substrate for neurodegeneration. A
similar intervention in human patients may have a profound translational value, addressing the crucial need for
accessible approaches to reduce or halt AD progression.
 We now propose to test the safety, feasibility, and effectiveness of a time-restricted eating (TRE) paradigm in
patients with a clinical diagnosis of cognitive impairment due to MCI or AD. We will recruit 40 patients and
randomize them into two groups that will follow a TRE model of prolonged fasting during the night (14h without
food intake) for 6 or 12 months. We will monitor blood-based markers of health, metabolism, epigenetic aging,
and AD pathology; record circadian regulation based on sleep and activity monitoring and evaluate cognitive
functions. The data collected will be fundamental to designing a larger clinical trial using TRE to improve
circadian function and reduce cognitive and pathology burden in AD. Since this is a safe intervention that does
not require drugs or special equipment, this intervention will be immediately available for millions of patients."

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 2-3% in the
general population. It manifests in a variety of intrusive thoughts (obsessions), rigid decision-making and
ritualistic behaviors (compulsions), with prolonged and disabling effects. However, the neural and
computational mechanisms underlying the disorder or its differentiations remain unclear, so that misdiagnosis
is frequent, and even when an appropriate treatment is established, about half the patients keep exhibiting
disabling residual symptoms. In this project, we propose to use an innovative approach, relying on
neurocomputational and connectivity analyses of fMRI data, jointly with multi-model-based computational
analyses of choice behavior across decision-making tasks. With these analyses, the project aims to
characterize OCD symptom severity and phenotype differentiation based on cortico-striatal and cortico-cortical
circuit dynamics, and to establish a relation between network-based phenotypes and model-based
parametrization of choice behavior across decision-making tasks. We will test the predictions of a newly
published neurocomputational theory, and its leading hypothesis that rigidity in motor, planning and goal
selections is caused by aberrant stability of transient dynamics in the dorsal, lateral and ventral cortico-striatal
circuit, respectively. We will test this hypothesis in a population of 140 subjects, equally distributed across five
categories defined on the YBOCS scale of OCD severity (subclinical, mild, moderate, severe and extreme).
We will use Dynamic Causal Modeling and Dependency Network Analysis to estimate subject-specific cortico-
striatal circuit dynamics (with planned redundancy to test convergence of results), and we will use
computational models based on reinforcement learning and Bayesian inference algorithms for the analysis of
choice behavior across decision-making tasks. OCD phenotypes are expected to show task-related motor,
planning and goal selection rigidity, expressed both in terms of model-based parameters of choice behavior
and effective connectivity and network measures responsible for aberrant circuit stability. If validated, this novel
characterization of neurocomputational OCD phenotypes would provide a more comprehensive explanation of
the heterogeneity in OCD symptomatology and treatment responses, helping the development of subject-
specific treatment tools, such as, for instance, personalized neuromodulation targets in deep brain stimulation
or transcranial magnetic stimulation."
10880096,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Neurodevelopmental impairment remains the most vexing issue facing the clinical
management of premature infants. Intrauterine infection and inflammation are significant causes of preterm
birth potentially resulting in lifelong neurodevelopmental impairment, such as cerebral palsy, sensory and
cognitive deficits and behavioral difficulties. Ureaplasma is a bacterial species that is a common cause of
preterm labor and non-human primates (NHP) are the most clinically relevant animal model in which to study
human preterm labor and fetal brain injury. Our unique chronically catheterized rhesus monkey model allows
constant physiological monitoring and longitudinal sampling of amniotic, maternal and fetal compartments and
evaluation of treatments longitudinally across gestation. In our previous NHP studies, antibiotic treatment
(Azithromycin) of intrauterine infection with Ureaplasma has been shown to delay preterm labor and improve
fetal lung and hemodynamic outcomes. Novel immunomodulatory drugs proposed for the treatment of preterm
labor would need to be combined with antimicrobials such as Azithromycin in the setting of intrauterine
infection. However, mechanisms of perinatal brain injury and the action of antibiotics on the fetal brain in
relation to intrauterine infection remain poorly understood. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to
determine how Azithromycin treatment may modulate fetal neuroinflammation caused by intrauterine
Ureaplasma infection, to improve fetal neurodevelopmental outcomes. Data from our previous NHP studies of
intrauterine Ureaplasma infection added to this resubmission includes evidence of: i) placental membrane
inflammation and inflammasome activation; ii) maternal Azithromycin treatment normalization of fetal blood
flow; and iii) preliminary data that fetal brain microglial activation is fully reversed by azithromycin treatment.
We also provide NHP data for detection of fetal neural extracellular vesicle markers of perinatal brain injury. In
Aim 1 we will assess physiological aspects of preterm labor and immune responses to intrauterine infection
and antibiotic treatment. Aim 2 will determine fetal brain molecular, histological and spatial transcriptomic
changes with Ureaplasma infection and Azithromycin treatment. In addition, we will characterize the
expression of microglia/astrocyte activation phenotypes and myelin development associated with
neuroinflammation. Aim 3 will investigate how fetal brain extracellular vesicles extracted from maternal blood
may be used as a novel, non-invasive diagnostic tool for perinatal brain injury and for the monitoring of
Azithromycin efficacy and safety. Development of novel diagnostic technologies is essential for the in vivo
monitoring of fetal status in response to treatment. Using a combination of novel techniques and our clinically
relevant NHP model, this proposal utilizes our team's extensive experience in studying pregnancy physiology,
fetal neurodevelopment and immunology. Successful completion of this study will provide essential missing
translational data on the mechanisms of fetal neuroinflammation and perinatal brain injury and its treatment."

The continued and inevitable emergence of antibiotic resistance demands a vigorous and sustained
effort to identify fundamentally new targets and strategies for innovative antimicrobial therapeutics.
Antibiotic-resistant enterococci are major causes of hospital-acquired infections. Enterococci are
successful hospital-acquired pathogens in part because of their intrinsic resistance to commonly used
antibiotics that target the bacterial cell envelope, such as cephalosporins. However, many questions
remain regarding the genetic and biochemical basis for cephalosporin resistance in enterococci. Our
preliminary data reveal previously unknown roles for an intracellular nucleotide signal and nucleotide
metabolite in control of enterococcal cephalosporin resistance. Little is known about how the activity
of the enzymes responsible for controlling levels of these intracellular nucleotides is regulated in
response to cell wall stress. Moreover, the targets for the nucleotide signal in enterococci are largely
unknown. Our preliminary data suggest a novel model for regulation in which sensory input from
physical association with other membrane-bound proteins regulates synthesis of the nucleotide signal
in response to cell wall stress. The major knowledge gaps to be addressed are that (i) the
mechanisms by which nucleotide signal synthesis is controlled in enterococci are unknown; (ii) the
molecular target(s) for nucleotide signal in the context of antimicrobial resistance are unknown; and
(iii) the mechanisms by which nucleotide metabolites impact cephalosporin resistance are unknown.
The research proposed here is designed to elucidate new insights into the roles and regulation of
intracellular nucleotides in the biological processes that drive enterococcal cephalosporin resistance.
By doing so, we will provide new insights into the fundamental biological processes that drive key
antibiotic resistance in enterococci and define new targets for innovative therapeutics designed to
impair enterococcal cephalosporin resistance."

 Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with serious health consequences that often
remains undertreated due to few therapeutic options beyond continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).
Alternative treatments are available, such as mandibular advancement devices (MADs) and hypoglossal nerve
stimulation (HGNS). However, these treatments are not always effective, and the predictors of success are
poorly understood or difficult to obtain. Furthermore, patients who fail these therapies are often left untreated
and therefore susceptible to the clinical consequences of OSA.
 In the previous grant period, we developed methods for estimating the pathophysiological endotypes of
OSA (pharyngeal collapsibility, loop gain, pharyngeal muscle compensation, and arousal threshold), as well as
the primary site of airway collapse (palate, tongue, lateral walls, epiglottis), from the clinical polysomnogram
(PSG). The objective of this grant is to apply these methods to 1) find predictors of MAD and HGNS response
and 2) test endotype-specific pharmacotherapies in MAD and HGNS non-responders. Our hypothesis is that
these endotypes/sites of collapse, as determined from the PSG, are important predictors of MAD and HGNS
response. We also hypothesize that the addition of a drug targeting an abnormal endotype, e.g., high loop
gain, can be used to more effectively treat MAD and HGNS non-responders.
 In the first two aims, the physiological endotypes and sites of collapse will be determined from the
clinical PSG using the methods developed in the previous grant cycle. Patients will then undergo MAD (Aim 1)
or HGNS (Aim 2) therapy. A follow-up PSG will be performed to evaluate the success of treatment. Using
multivariable logistic regression, the significant physiological predictors of success will be determined.
 In Aim 3, the patients who fail MAD or HGNS in the previous aims, approximately one-third of
individuals, will be treated with a drug targeting the most abnormal endotype (acetazolamide for high loop gain,
atomoxetine-plus-oxybutynin for poor pharyngeal muscle compensation, or trazodone for low arousal
threshold). Recent evidence suggests that these drugs can manipulate the endotypes. The drug will be
administered concurrently with MAD or HGNS treatment (combination therapy).
 Aims 1 and 2 are expected to find the important physiological predictors of MAD and HGNS response,
respectively, using novel metrics derived from the clinical PSG. Aim 3 is expected to provide proof-of-principle
for a pharmacologic approach to treating MAD and HGNS failures, patients who otherwise have limited
treatment options. Ultimately, these studies have the potential to improve patient selection for non-CPAP
alternatives and broaden the treatment options for OSA."

Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) children often have limited or delayed access to language during early
childhood, which has harmful consequences for language acquisition and many aspects of child development.
While there have been great strides in technology and available interventions to support language acquisition,
there is still tremendous variability in language skills and development outcomes of DHH children. This is in
part because families have to navigate a complex landscape of early interventions while deciding how best to
support their DHH child. The first aim of this project is to document how families plan and manage language
learning for their children using a series of interviews and surveys. A major challenge in understanding how
best to support DHH children is that without centralized ways to find families, most research studies recruit
participants through organizations like cochlear implant clinics and school programs, and focus on just a
subset of DHH children (e.g., just those learning ASL, or just those using cochlear implants). This raises issues
of sampling bias – children affiliated with a certain program may be quite different from children not affiliated
with that program. The second aim of this study is to use a new database of all identified DHH children
between 0 and 3 years old in California to recruit a large sample that includes children across the full spectrum
of interventions and language backgrounds. We will document patterns in family language planning,
participation in early intervention, and early language skills in whatever language(s) children are learning. This
will provide crucial information about how often children receive various interventions, how often they achieve
age-appropriate language skills, and whether there are any disparities in access to early intervention support
and language outcomes. The third aim is to validate a new multi-lingual language assessment designed for
DHH children. The findings from this study hold the potential to inform evidence-based interventions, enhance
early childhood language planning, and pave the way for improved outcomes and opportunities for DHH
children by fostering their language development and overall well-being."
10899968,"During animal development, signaling centers (a.k.a., ‘organizers’) play fundamental roles in the formation of
organs, such as the CNS. Organizers consist of groups of cells that produce secreted factors (morphogens) that
act on adjacent cells, often in the form of gradients, to induce distinct cell fates at different positions in the
gradient. Dysfunction of organizers causes developmental disorders (e.g., agenesis of neural structures and limb
defects). Hence, a key goal of developmental biology is to understand how organizers form and function.
 Several organizers have been implicated in CNS development (e.g., the anterior neural ridge organizer
(ANR) and the isthmic organizer; IsO), but we do not understand how a population of neural progenitors is
imparted with the ability to secrete specific morphogens and act as an organizer. The IsO is the most-studied
CNS organizer as initial observations over a century ago defined a constriction (isthmus) forming in the
neurectoderm at the junction of the midbrain and hindbrain primordia. The isthmus was later shown to contain a
signaling center with the ability to produce Fgf8 and to control differentiation and positioning of adjacent neural
structures, but we do not understand the cellular and molecular components required for IsO function.
While the isthmic constriction appears to be positioned at the interface of the midbrain and hindbrain primordia
– the IsO itself has been variably predicted to be derived from the midbrain or the hindbrain primordium, and we
do not understand how the IsO is formed and positioned in the embryonic CNS.
 One key barrier to filling these knowledge gaps has been a lack of comprehensive molecular data for
organizers during their formation in the CNS. A simple gene regulatory network acting at the isthmus was
delineated decades ago, but it contains few gene. As a result, there is no clear molecular signature for the IsO,
and we therefore cannot study its formation and function. Using scMultiome analysis – that enables simultaneous
characterization of gene expression and epigenetic profiles of individual cells – we overcame this barrier and
molecularly identified two cell populations that express known isthmic genes at zebrafish segmentation
stages. One population co-expresses midbrain genes and one hindbrain genes, suggesting that they correspond
to isthmic cells in the midbrain (IsMB) and hindbrain (IsHB), respectively. The IsHB also expresses fgf8 –
indicating that it contains the IsO – but not all IsHB cells are fgf8-positive. At earlier stages (end of gastrulation),
our analysis detects the IsMB, but the IsHB is not fully formed, and it is unclear if the IsO is associated with the
IsMB or the IsHB at this stage. Our analyses represent the first molecular resolution of the isthmic region
and includes earlier stages than prior work. These advances allow us to address key questions: What isthmic
cell populations are required for IsO function? Does the IsO arise from the IsMB or the IsHB? We will answer
these questions in the context of our hypothesis that the IsO consists of multiple essential cell types and
derives from an early isthmic cell population (the IsMB) that possesses midbrain character."
10900055,"Otitis Media (OM) is one of the most common conditions of early childhood, accounting for a very high proportion of all pediatric physician office visits annually with national health care cost estimated to be greater than $2 billion. Despite the overuse and emergence of resistant pathogens, antibiotics remain the primary medical form of OM management. In fact, antibiotics for acute otitis media (AOM) are the most common prescriptions for children. In turn, tympanostomy tube placement to treat chronic otitis media (COM) is the most common pediatric surgical procedure requiring anesthesia in the United States. The most reliable and commonly used method for the diagnosis of OM in clinical practice is pneumotoscopy, which provides visible light illumination and mobility assessment of the tympanic membrane (TM). However, pediatricians and otolaryngologists correctly identify middle ear effusions at a rate of 51% and 73%, respectively highlighting the need for new diagnostic modalities in the primary care setting. To address the inability to diagnose otitis media adequately, we have developed three innovative methods leveraging novel optical modalities and molecular probes to target bacteria and cysteine proteases. For our first aim, we developed a shortwave infrared (SWIR) fluorescence otoscopy capable of imaging bacterial infections using a maltotriose probe that targets gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria via an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter unique to prokaryotic and not eukaryotic cells. Identifying a bacterial otitis media infection can help reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, which contribute to multi-resistant bacteria. In our second aim, we have designed a Spatial Offset Raman Spectroscopy (SORS) probe able to be used with current ear speculums to provide molecular information regarding changes in the eardrum and middle ear fluid.. Understanding the molecular changes in the tympanic membrane can provide prognostic information regarding the progression or resolution of otitis media. Clinically we rely on otoscopy and significant visible changes to assess the middle ear. Understanding the optical signatures Raman spectroscopy provides can help us improve how we monitor otitis media. We will also collect middle ear samples to test our previously described algorithm to differentiate serous from mucoid middle ear effusions. Lastly, to address our goal of clinical translation, for our third aim, we have developed a shortwave infrared otoscope to diagnose middle ear effusion based on the increased absorption of light by water in the shortwave infrared wavelengths at around 1450nm. We will perform a pilot clinical trial in two institutions on the ability of shortwave infrared otoscopy to diagnose middle ear effusions. The proposed application will build on novel imaging modalities to refine non-invasive diagnostic imaging strategies for preclinical and clinical translation applications for otitis media."
10900314,"ABSTRACT
Cognitive impairments, which characterize many neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum
disorder, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability, likely arise from aberrant neurodevelopmental processes.
Copy number variations (CNVs), such as the 22q11.2 hemizygous deletion, confer a very high risk for specific
cognitive deficits. We demonstrated that in mice, constitutive heterozygosity of Tbx1, a transcription factor
gene within the 22q11.2 CNV, resulted in reduced mature oligodendrocytes and myelination, and decreased
levels of Ng2 mRNA, a gene required for the production of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. These mice
showed reduced speed in completing a task in attentional set-shifting and increased latency in spatial memory
acquisition. Strikingly, conditional initiation of Tbx1 heterozygosity in stem cells during the neonatal (P1–P5),
but not the peripubertal (P21–P25) period, reduced the speed to perform a cognitive task in mice in a way
similar to constitutive Tbx1 heterozygous mice. Our results suggest that TBX1 expression during the neonatal
developmental period is critical for the normal development of myelin and cognitive speed; however, the
mechanism of TBX1 action is unknown. It is not known whether TBX1 expression during the neonatal period is
essential for the proliferation of stem cells that give rise to oligodendrocyte precursor cells for myelination,
which affects cognitive speed. Here, I propose experiments to increase our understanding of post-embryonic
mechanisms underlying the cognitive deficits associated with TBX1 deficiency. We hypothesize that TBX1 is
essential for the development of cognitive speed through the regulation of neonatal stem cells that produce
oligodendrocytes and myelination. To test this hypothesis, we will use conditional Tbx1 heterozygous mouse
models to induce Tbx1 heterozygosity in stem cells during the neonatal or postnatal periods or in
oligodendrocyte precursor cells during the neonatal period. In these mice, we will measure cognitive speed in
spontaneous alternation and attentional set-shifting (Aim 1) and assess cellular phenotypes in neonatal stem
cells, oligodendrocytes and their precursor cells, and myelination (Aim 2). Moreover, we have identified
thousands of potential target genes of the TBX1 transcription factor by ChIP-seq, among which FoxG1 is the
only gene that is associated with stem cells, neurodevelopmental disorders, and cerebral dysmyelination.
Therefore, we will determine the role of TBX1 in FoxG1 regulation (Aim 3). There are no reliable diagnostic
markers or cures for neurodevelopmental disorders. The results from this research will significantly advance
our knowledge of the neurobiological mechanisms that lead to neurodevelopmental disorders, a prerequisite
for the development of treatments based on precision medicine. Moreover, the multidisciplinary and
translational aspects of the proposed training plan will provide rigorous training for the applicant to transition to
an independent physician-scientist."

10903812,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Kawasaki disease (KD), the leading cause of acquired heart disease among children in the US, is an acute
febrile illness and systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology that causes coronary artery aneurysms (CAA) and can
result in long-term cardiovascular sequelae. While Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment lowers CAA
development to 5%, up to 20% of KD patients are IVIG-resistant and have a greater risk for coronary
inflammation. A better understanding of the immune pathological mechanisms leading to the development of KD
vasculitis is one of the highest research priorities. Recent genetic data, and data from experimental mouse model
of KD, have all converged on the critical role of IL-1 signaling in pathogenesis of the KD lesions. Two clinical
trials using the IL-1R antagonist were recently initiated in KD patients who do not respond to IVIG. Studies
identifying the underlying immune-specific mechanisms involved in IL-1β production are needed and little is
known regarding which immune cell subsets produce IL-1β during KD vasculitis. By using a murine model of KD
vasculitis associated with coronary artery inflammation and abdominal aorta aneurysm development, we found
that inflamed vascular lesions are infiltrated by neutrophils and eosinophils that express high levels of Il1b, Nlrp3
and Padi4 transcripts, the latter one encodes PAD4, a protein known for its crucial role in neutrophils extracellular
traps (NETs) formation. Our preliminary data also demonstrate that PAD4 inhibition blocks not only IL-1β
production in vitro but also prevents LCWE-induced KD vasculitis in vivo, how this blockade directly affect NETs
and eosinophils extracellular traps (EETs) formation and their IL-1β production remain unknown. Our new data
also demonstrate that IL-33 is pathogenic and may promote the pro-inflammatory functions of eosinophils
through the IL-33 receptor, ST2. Therefore, based on our preliminary data, the central hypothesis from this
application is that activated neutrophils and eosinophils promote LCWE-induced KD vasculitis through a
PAD4-dependent release of NETs and EETs, bioactive IL-1β and other pro-inflammatory mediators. Here,
we will investigate the role of eosinophils and neutrophils during murine KD vasculitis and propose interventions
aiming to block IL-1β production by those cells and PAD4 signaling, as well as the disruption of IL-33 signaling
on eosinophils, which may result in decreased inflammation and the prevention of KD lesions. To investigate this
central hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the role of infiltrating neutrophils
during LCWE-induced KD vasculitis, 2) Determine the role of tissue-infiltrating eosinophils during
LCWE-induced KD vasculitis and 3)Determine the role of PAD4 in neutrophils and eosinophils during
LCWE-induced KD vasculitis. The successful conclusion of these studies will significantly alter the way KD is
understood and influence the development of new therapies."

The number of physician-scientists working in lung cancer has not kept pace with the overall growth of the
medical research community or with the growth in our basic knowledge base, resulting in an increasing number
of unrealized basic and translational research opportunities. Yale is uniquely suited to helping rebuild this base
with our strong commitment to translational research. The Career Enhancement Program (CEP) of the Yale
SPORE in Lung Cancer (YSILC) has been designed to contribute substantively to ongoing efforts and new
initiatives attempting to address this problem. The goal of the CEP is to educate a new generation of
investigators committed to translational research in lung cancer. The CEP has substantial institutional
commitment, both in terms of funding and infrastructure. For example, our translational research office at Yale
(also led by Dr. Herbst, YSILC PI) has been committed to providing early seed funding and translational
support to young investigators early in their research careers. Potential CEP candidates include promising
junior faculty who are interested in establishing their careers in translational lung cancer research and/or
established investigators whose previous research has been in other areas and would like to transition into
lung cancer focused research. Junior faculty awardees will be paired with mentors who are more established
lung cancer investigators with a documented record of successful mentoring. In this way, the YSILC will
stimulate the development of the next generation of physician scientists, addressing the most challenging
issues in lung cancer research."

Although education is often cited as the most important protective factor against Alzheimer’s Disease and related
dementias (ADRD), most research in this area ignores the educational contexts in which that schooling took
place. Moreover, it has yet to consider whether and how early educational contexts shape the relationship
between genetics and ADRD, even though there is a strong genetic component to ADRD. Over the last several
years, I have been developing a research program to advance scientific understanding of the role of education
in dementia risk. This Mid-Career Independent Scientist (K02) award proposal builds upon this foundation by
expanding my expertise in education and ADRD to the field of genetics. My long-term career goal is to establish
myself as a national and international expert in ADRD. To achieve this goal, I have identified four objectives as
part of the K02 project: 1) develop knowledge of and advanced analytic skills in using genetic markers of ADRD
and polygenic risk scores for cognitive impairment and dementia; 2) cultivate new collaborations with established
social scientists who have expertise in using genetic data in population studies broadly as well as specific to
ADRD; 3) extend my currently funded research (R01AG067536) to examine how genetic susceptibility to
cognitive impairment and dementia interacts with early educational contexts and may result in differential risk for
cognitive decline and impairment; and 4) apply the data and knowledge gained from the K02 award to secure
additional R01 and P30-level funding to support my research program in ADRD and build institutional capacity
in aging and ADRD at the University of Maryland, College Park and the Washington D.C. area. To achieve my
K02 objectives, I have established a team of collaborators who are leading ADRD researchers or social scientists
with expertise in genetics and who will jointly contribute to my professional development as a gene (G) x
environment (E) researcher in ADRD. Further, I have the institutional support and environment necessary to
carry out the project. The K02 award will accelerate my research program and establish me as a senior
investigator in aging and ADRD by providing me with protected time to develop strategic collaborations, skillsets,
and knowledge in the genetic and biological underpinnings of ADRD. Findings from the K02 project will advance
scientific understanding of how genetic and environmental factors interact and result in differential brain health
and functioning, an NIA research priority area, and can inform policies aimed at reducing dementia prevalence
in future cohorts of older adults. Importantly, my prior scholarly, funding, and mentoring success provide
evidence that I can translate the protected time and training provided by the K02 into exponential professional
growth and scientific impact."
10894708,"Nearly one in five 2-5 year old U.S. children has obesity, and over half of today’s children are expected to have obesity by adulthood. Failure to prevent childhood obesity thus puts a majority of our children at increased risk of diet-related chronic diseases including type II diabetes mellitus. Early childhood is critical for the formation of habits for eating, physical activity, and other behaviors that contribute to a healthy weight, yet diet in early childhood is currently poor. A promising public health approach to establishing healthy eating habits in early childhood is through strengthening the nutrition standards of the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), a federal food assistance program that reaches millions of young children attending child care settings in the US. CACFP standards for meals served were recently updated, but incomplete implementation has weakened the impact of this policy change. Identification of a strategy to improve implementation could help to ensure that the intended policy improvements to CACFP translate into improved child health. This study proposes to collect novel data on the implementation challenges that child care providers face in adopting healthier eating standards, including data on administrative challenges and costs. Then, using this formative research, we will develop an implementation intervention to help child care centers adopt stronger CACFP nutrition standards.
The NIDDK K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will help fill critical training gaps in 1) dissemination and implementation science and 2) cost analysis, and will build on my advanced training in intervention evaluation and social epidemiology. My long-term career goal is to develop a robust research program that uses strategic science to inform effective policy development and policy implementation, to prevent nutrition-related chronic diseases at a population level. The training plan involves coursework in implementation science and cost analysis, combined with structured mentoring, meetings, workshops, and seminars, to establish new skills in these areas. The research plan proposed will allow me to apply these new skills and build on my existing skill set. The combined training and research plan, with the strong institutional support and excellent intellectual environment of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, will ensure my transition into an independent researcher able to compete successfully for R01 funding and help me develop into a leader in the field of public health approaches to improving child nutrition and preventing later diet-related chronic diseases."

As the number of Americans living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is projected to reach 13 million by 2050, we
must prioritize efforts for early disease detection. The bottleneck of early AD detection has greatly hindered
clinical treatment and development of successful therapeutics. With greater availability of multimodal AD
biomarkers in clinical practice, we have a unique opportunity to leverage statistical machine learning for earlier
detection of AD. Past work has demonstrated good classification accuracy of clinical diagnosis of AD using
binary classifications (i.e., AD-dementia vs healthy cognition, HC; mild cognitive impairment, MCI vs HC; AD vs
MCI). These classifiers, however, are often reliant on unimodal biomarker inputs, and no formal comparison of
multimodal biomarker integration (“fusion”) methods exist for predicting either AD clinical diagnosis or
biomarker status as defined by the A/T(N) framework. Lack of optimal multimodal fusion strategies and holistic
diagnosis prediction beyond binary classification reduce the translational value of statistical machine learning
classifiers in clinical practice. This proposal fills these gaps by evaluating several competing strategies for
multimodal fusion and multiclass classification (e.g., AD vs MCI vs HC) using data from the National
Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center and Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The strength of using large,
multimodal datasets for disease prediction is accompanied by the challenge of handling missing data, a barrier
for building a reliable classifier. This proposal will address these challenges with two specific aims: (1) compare
techniques for optimal data imputation and multimodal fusion, and (2) develop a multiclass model to accurately
predict AD status (AD/MCI/HC and A+T+/A+T-/A-T-) using multimodal inputs. Preliminary analyses of
multimodal data fusion in binary classification using random forest and sparse group lasso classifiers motivate
Aim 1. Preliminary analysis of two strategies of multiclass classification demonstrates feasibility of developing a
multimodal, multiclass classifier for Aim 2. The proposed work will be enhanced by the excellent training and
research environment at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), including direct access to 1 of 33 NIA-funded
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs). The ADRC offers a third, independent dataset to serve as a
validation set to improve the rigor of results from the proposed experiments. The applicant will be supported by
the joint mentorship of Dr. Craig Stark, the ADRC Biomarker Core Leader, and Dr. Babak Shahbaba, Director
of the UCI Data Science Initiative, and will receive advanced training in both aging and AD research and
statistics and machine learning techniques. Fellowship training will be further strengthened by the additional
mentorship of Dr. Peter Chang for machine learning, Dr. Michele Guindani for multimodal data fusion, and Dr.
S. Ahmad Sajjadi for clinical expertise in AD. The proposed training and research plans will result in the
development of a reliable, multimodal, and multiclass classifier for AD status prediction to enable earlier
disease detection and stratification of patients for more effective clinical trials."

In this application we propose to build on our work in the previous three phases of eMERGE to develop and
validate polygenic risk scores (PRS) for 15 common diseases and combine these with clinical risk scores and
family history to create comprehensive risk profiles for 2500 individuals (35% non-European ancestry). We will
develop phenotyping algorithms to identify cases and controls for the 15 diseases and ascertain clinical risk
scores for each disease by extracting relevant variables from the electronic health record (EHR). Next, using
existing eMERGE genotype and phenotype data (n=105,000) and publicly available (TopMed, AoU, MVP,
UKBB) datasets, we will calculate candidate loci or genome wide PRS using novel methods to adapt these to
specific racial/ethnic groups. Validated PRS will be combined with family history and clinical risk scores to
create comprehensive risk profiles. We have previously applied such methodology for coronary heart disease,
positioning us well to expand this to 14 additional common diseases. To assess the utility of PRS in a
prospective cohort, we will recruit participants from Rochester MN (1800 adults and 200 adolescents) and
Phoenix AZ (500 adults of Hispanic ethnicity). DNA will be sent for CLIA-certified genomic testing and we will
calculate race/ethnicity specific PRS. Individualized risk estimates will be reported to participants and providers
and placed in the EHR with linkage to clinical decision support (CDS) that includes guideline-based risk-
management information. For participants who are at significantly higher risk for developing at least 1 of the
15 diseases (estimated 25% of the cohort), results will be disclosed in-person followed by assessment of
outcomes including new tests ordered, risk reduction measures, and changes in modifiable risk factors. In
addition we will examine the economic, behavioral and psychosocial implications of returning PRS. Our focus
on PRS brings genomic medicine to the population and we will continue our partnership with Mountain Park
Health Center, a FQHC serving low-income, minority communities across Phoenix AZ, to address concerns
about health disparities in the context of genomic medicine. Our specific aims include: 1) Utilize extant
genotype and EHR data on 105,000 eMERGE participants as well as other publicly available datasets to
validate PRS for 15 common diseases; 2) Deploy novel methods for integrating PRS in the EHR with linkage to
CDS that incorporates guideline based clinical recommendations and develop scalable methods for disclosing
PRS results to participants; 3) Enroll 2500 persons to undergo CLIA genotyping using dense SNP arrays and
return comprehensive risk profiles that include PRS; 4) Assess clinical, cost/utilization and psychosocial
outcomes following return of results."

Healthcare Corporation (BMHCC), a non-for-profit faith-based healthcare system with 22 hospitals, 21
outpatient oncology clinics, 8 radiation facilities, and 19 outpatient infusion centers, providing care for
approximately 8000 new cancer patients each year. BMHCC’s service area covers 111 counties, 4.3 million
people. This is 44% of the 252 counties and parishes in the Delta Regional Authority, congressionally
acknowledged as the most indigent population in the US. BMHCC provides 25% of cancer care in this racially,
socioeconomically and culturally diverse region, which has some of the highest volumes of cancer and the
most fragile public health infrastructure in the US. Before our NCORP, these patients had no access to clinical
trials. In the 4 years since our NCORP began in August 2014, more than 90 patients per year have been
enrolled into trials, including 168 patients in 2017/18; 39% of our enrolled patients are racial minorities, 17%
reside in rural areas, 13% are uninsured, 21% have Medicaid. Members of our NCORP serve on multiple
NCORP taskforces and NCI Steering Committees, including the Cancer Prevention Steering Committee. We
have used our unique expertise in establishing Multidisciplinary Care Delivery programs in Breast, Thoracic,
Gastrointestinal and Hematologic Oncology to develop Disease-Specific Research Groups that link our
NCORP research closely to our clinical oncology care programs. This strategy has accelerated our progress in
the past 2 years. Our system-wide implementation of the Electronic Health Record system, EPIC, has
enhanced our research ability, especially in Cancer Care Delivery Research. For the new funding cycle, we
propose to expand our NCORP research infrastructure across the full extent of BMHCC, with special emphasis
on increasing patient recruitment across the state of Mississippi. Using Implementation and Team Science
principles and a data-driven approach, our overarching goal is to increase the proportion of BMHCC oncology
patients who participate in clinical trials from <3% in 2018 to 10% by 2025. With almost 8000 annual new
cancer cases, this would significantly exceed the minimum requirements of the NCORP, to the benefit of our
patients, communities and healthcare system, because we believe that ‘the best treatment is a clinical trial.’
Our specific aims are to increase the: 1.) number of active sites from 5 to 16 by 2025, by expanding to all our
Mississippi institutions; 2.) proportion of oncology-related providers accruing patients to >90%; 3.) clinical trials
activity in urogenital and gynecologic oncology; 4.) average annual patient-enrollment into NCORP trials from
90 to >250. Achieving our goal will help achieve the NCI’s mission of improving the health of this key US
population demographic by narrowing a major recognized health disparity: poor access of the large indigent,
racial minority and rural populations within the Mississippi Delta region to high quality oncologic care."

oropharyngeal cancer, are significantly higher than in the general population. Yet, the etiology and
pathophysiology of oral HPV infection in PWH are not well-documented. The role of oral microbiota has long
been recognized in the etiology of many oral infections and diseases. Persistent immune activation and
inflammation and impaired oral mucosa epithelial tight junctions from HIV infection and treatment could result
in oral microbial dysbiosis, leading to oral HPV infection. However, current evidence on the association
between the oral microbiome and oral HPV infection is lacking among PWH. Additionally, as a polymicrobial
condition and another primary inflammatory resource, periodontal diseases are most commonly seen in PWH
in the face of ART and may facilitate oral HPV infection. Research evaluating the role of periodontal diseases
on oral HPV acquisition and persistence is sparse, particularly in the context of the oral microbiome.
Furthermore, the oral microbiome is a crucial mediator of inflammation and immune regulation, two major
contributors to oral HPV infection. Still, oral mucosa's inflammatory and immune responses to HPV infection
are less understood. Therefore, we propose a longitudinal, cohort study of 500 PWH to examine the
association among oral microbiome, periodontal diseases, and oral HPV infection. Participants will be followed
up to two years with every six months for oral HPV testing and periodontal status and every year for oral
microbiome assessments. We will also examine the oral immune and inflammatory responses yearly and
investigate the alterations in oral immunological profiling related to oral microbiome and oral HPV infection.
Moreover, a total of 86% of our eligible patients are African American, and 52% of them are below the federal
poverty level, suggesting the difficulties in receiving health care services and the importance of studying social
determinants of health for PWH. Thus, we will also explore the impact of social determinants of health, such
as neighborhood conditions, on oral microbiome and oral HPV infection. Findings will provide needed
evidence on whether and how the oral microbiome and periodontal disease play a crucial role in oral HPV
infection among PWH. The identified oral microbiota will be instrumental in developing targeted interventions
to reduce oral HPV infection and subsequently lower HPV-associated HNC incidences among PWH.
Addressing critical social determinants of health will provide invaluable implementation recommendations to
reduce health disparities and improve health-related outcomes for PWH."
10894834,"A primary driver of immune deficiency caused by HIV is the destruction of T cells, which if left untreated results
in AIDS. Depression of cellular immunity results in a failure to control pre-existing virus infections, such as
those by the human gammaherpesviruses: the Epstein-Barr virus and the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus. In some AIDS patients this results in severe disease, due to a failure to control virus-infected
cells. Disease is a consequence of infection of B cells that harbor latent infection in the absence of virus
replication. Previous work has shown the memory CD8 T cell response is the most important component of
immune surveillance that controls latently infected cells in healthy patients. Therefore deeper understanding of
CD8 T cell-mediated immune surveillance can help us understand how this response fails in AIDS patients,
promoting development of strategies to restore immune surveillance to prevent gammaherpesvirus-associated
diseases. This proposal will build on the novel finding that the BTB-ZF family transcription repressor Zbtb20 is
essential for effective immune surveillance against murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68). This rodent virus
has proven to be an excellent model for virus-immune interactions, recapitulating many of the immune
mechanisms used to control AIDS-relevant gammaherpesviruses. Preliminary data show the absence of
Zbtb20 prevents the generation of cells with an effector / effector memory transcriptional signature. In addition
rates of both glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism were aberrantly elevated in Zbtb20-deficient CD8 T cells,
indicating an important role for Zbtb20 in regulating immunometabolic status appropriate for the differentiation
state of the T cell. This is critical, as it is clear that the metabolic state of the T cell is a critical driver of
differentiation to memory cells, but very little is known about the metabolic state required for long-term
immune surveillance. Our transcriptomic data identify key genes in glycolytic and mitochondrial respiratory
pathways that are elevated in the absence of Ztbtb20. We will test whether dysregulation of these genes leads
to attrition of immune surveillance, and if gene knockdown restores appropriate T cell differentiation and
immunometabolism. Further experiments test the extent to which Zbtb20 is necessary for protection from
disease associated with gammaherpesvirus infection in mice lacking endogenous T cell immunity, to mimic
AIDS-defining immunodeficiency. These parameters are also tested using T cells genetically modified to
restore effector memory differentiation or normalize metabolic rates. In summary, the significance is a
mechanistic understanding of what is required for effective immune surveillance against an important class of
AIDS-associated pathogen. Armed with this knowledge, we can design improved immune-based therapies to
prevent serious disease in AIDS patients."
10894841,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 42 million
individuals in the United States and long-term complications are frequently reported, referred to as post-acute
sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). Even among survivors with mild acute illness, neurologic symptoms such
as chronic fatigue, dysautonomia, and cognitive impairment are frequently reported. To date, the etiology and
pathophysiology of neurologic PASC remain unclear; however, underlying autoantibodies and immune
activation are suspected. In our prospective COVID-19 ID Persistence Cohort (C-PIC), more than half of
COVID-19 survivors are reporting neurologic PASC at one year. We have identified an association between
neurologic PASC with both SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and ANA. Specifically, nucleocapsid (NP)
antibody levels are elevated compared to spike trimer (ST) antibody levels in participants with neurologic
PASC. Furthermore, our preliminary data has identified a potential signal linking neurologic PASC and
decreased gastrointestinal microbiota diversity. In this mentored career project, we hypothesize that
autoimmunity, immune activation, and microbiome dysbiosis are associated with neurologic PASC. Candidate:
As an Infectious Diseases physician with a master’s in public health and applied epidemiology and outbreak
training through the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Epidemic Intelligence Service, I am uniquely
positioned to study the epidemiology and determinants for neurologic PASC. My experience studying post-
Ebola syndrome in Liberia provided me with the foresight to contribute viral persistence and sequelae aims to
the C-PIC study, which includes longitudinal PASC survey data and biorepository specimens. Through the
guidance of my outstanding multidisciplinary team of mentors, I plan to fulfill my training objectives of (1)
developing expertise in advanced biostatistical analysis of survey data and (2) bridging translational research
and descriptive cohort data. Environment: My team of mentors at Columbia University Irving Medical Center
(CUIMC) are experts in epidemiology, biostatistics, immunology, and microbiome analysis. CUIMC also has a
long track record of enabling young physician-scientists to develop independent and successful careers in
academic medicine. Approach: We hypothesize that chronic fatigue, dysautonomia, and cognitive impairment
sub-phenotypes of neurologic PASC have different underlying pathophysiology, including autoimmunity,
immune activation, and microbiome dysbiosis. In Aim 1, we will characterize neurologic PASC epidemiology,
trajectory, and sub-phenotypes using longitudinal neurologic PASC surveys. In Aim 2, we will identify
associations between neurologic PASC with SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and autoantibodies. In Aim 3, we
will identify associations between neurologic PASC and immune activation and explore the role of gut
microbiota. This proposal provides an innovative approach to studying determinants for neurologic PASC, and
the proposed training will facilitate my transition into an independently funded clinician-scientist."
10894911,"DOE Project summary This ICWUC seeks to continue the DOE site training delivered by teams of DOE
worker trainers at the four targeted sites (251 classes to 3,846 trainees). These sites are fully operational
and rely on onsite experienced worker trainers (Hanford, Oak Ridge and Kansas City) while Los Alamos
National Laboratory (LANL) utilizes an experienced local DOE worker trainer. The IAMAW is a significant
partner in these efforts representing members at three of these sites. The Center uses a range of adult
education principles and techniques that rely on the knowledge and experiences of the participants to
teach key principles in a non-threatening and engaging method that motivates trainees to improve their
worksites.
Classes to be presented include a range of HAZWOPER related classes including 5 day CERCLA course
(12 classes; 152 trainees); 16-Hour Bridge classes for workers transferring into regulated areas and RCRA
classes (16 classes, 200 trainees) with all covered workers taking an eight hour refresher class annually
(73 classes, 1,634 trainees). There will be respirator refreshers at Hanford (14 classes, 308 trainees) and
fall protection and confined space programs at LANL (94 classes; 1,220 trainees). DOE worker-trainers
from each site will deliver all training, a cost-effective resource to the contractor and local union and there
will be 8 trainer development classes for 112 trainers. This includes a DOE trainers’ exchange and we will
continue our collaborative work with other Grantees. We will continue our community outreach efforts that
need to be significantly expanded.
We will continue to assess the workplace changes the program has produced through the long term
evaluation of participants and trainers. Our recent publication shows that these trainers have become
invaluable resources that co-workers and managers frequently request their opinion on the appropriate
practices, procedures and equipment about health and safety concerns (at least monthly) and that a variety
of workplace changes have occurred through the trainers’ efforts. Trainers are commonly asked by other
workers about toxic effects of chemicals, respirators, gloves and other protective clothing and respirators."

Profiling kinases and their activities in single cells will enable exploration of cell type specific
functional and biochemical pathways. While we have learned a great deal about transcriptional
states of different cell types in the past decade through single cell genomics, we still understand
little about proteins and in particular kinases networks in diverse cell populations. This is largely
because single-cell kinome analysis faces major technical challenges. Unlike nucleic acids,
proteins cannot be amplified, making detection of minute quantities from single cells difficult. We
recently demonstrated a proof-of-principle experiment to accurately detect protein PTM isoforms
in single cells. Here we propose to scale this method up to profile kinases at the global level in
single cells in both cell culture and in tissues. We will integrate the single cell kinome analysis
with RNA measurements to identify cell type specific kinase profiles. Ultimately, we will map
the kinome with spatial context in the mouse and human brain to examine the kinase pathways
involved in aging and neurodegeneration which could identify druggable targets. This project is a
major departure from our current research. Its goals are ambitious but achievable. The project
will leverage our expertise in single cell technology development and in application of new
technology to diverse biological systems."
10874755,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is prevalent, costly and associated with high morbidity and
mortality. It is also a remarkably heterogeneous condition with regards to both its pulmonary and systemic
manifestations. The mechanistic underpinnings of this heterogeneity remain poorly understood and treatment
approaches for patients with COPD are still mostly the same. Metabolomics is the large-scale study of low
molecular weight compounds, commonly known as metabolites, within cells, tissues or biological fluids.
Preliminary data suggest that specific metabolomics profiles are associated with poor clinical outcomes in
COPD and may reveal unique insights into disease heterogeneity. Such investigations could ultimately lead to
the development of new therapeutic approaches which are sorely needed. However, the potential of
metabolomics remains largely untapped in COPD. This K23 mentored career development application
proposes a coordinated 5-year training and research plan to allow Wassim Labaki, MD, MS to achieve his
long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist. His scientific focus will be on patient-oriented
clinical and translational COPD research, specifically in the field of metabolomics. Dr. Labaki will be mentored
and advised by experts not only in metabolomics, but also bioinformatics and clinical research to help him
hone such skills during the award period. His training plan will include advanced coursework at the University
of Michigan School of Public Health and Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, further
supplemented by hands-on practical experience in the metabolomics laboratories at the University of Michigan
and regular participation in various national and institutional workshops and conferences. This application will
take advantage of the clinically well-characterized NIH-funded SPIROMICS COPD cohort to identify
mechanistic metabolic pathways involved in COPD pathogenesis and progression that could be intervened
upon early in the disease course. The specific Aims of this project are to: 1) define the serum metabolomics
profiles associated with COPD phenotypes, especially the frequent exacerbator phenotype; 2) determine the
relationship between longitudinal changes in the serum metabolome and progression of COPD over 5 years of
follow-up; and 3) investigate the impact of reduction in hyperinflation via lung volume reduction surgery on the
serum metabolome. The work planned in this proposal leverages the unique infrastructure and expertise of the
Michigan Regional Comprehensive Metabolomics Resource Core at the University of Michigan. The
preliminary data and rigorous training acquired through the successful completion of this proposal will position
Dr. Labaki to lead targeted metabolomics validation studies and clinical trials in future R01 applications."
10874759,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Heart disease, the most common cause of death, frequently arises from blocking blood flow to cardiac
muscle. Blood flow travels to the heart first through coronary arteries and then into a capillary network where
oxygen exchange occurs. One approach to treating heart disease has been to expand the capillary network,
but this has achieved limited success. Here, we propose to instead expand coronary artery networks and
promote the development of collateral arteries, which are a subtype of artery with the potential to form a natural
bypass. In the previous funding period, our laboratory discovered cellular and molecular mechanisms driving
coronary artery formation in the developing embryo, including how the transcription factor Dach1 supports
artery growth through regulating blood flow stimulated cell behaviors (Chang, 2017, Genes and Dev). We also
described how the chemokine CXCL12 triggers collateral artery formation in the injured heart during the
neonatal growth period (Das, 2019, Cell). We hypothesize that these developmental pathways can be utilized
to stimulate adult coronary artery regeneration and provide beneficial outcomes during cardiac injury and
disease. Preliminary studies activating Dach1 or CXCl12 in adults shows indications of enhanced recovery
following experimental myocardial infarction. We will use the following Aims to further explore their reparative
potential. Aim 1 will use tissue clearing, whole organ imaging technology, and computational modeling to
define how injury, Dach1 overexpression, and CXCL12 administration alter artery structure and affect blood
flow parameters. Aim 2 will use cardiac injury models to intensively study how Dach1- and CXCL12-induced
artery growth and collateral development enhance recovery post-myocardial infarction. Aim 3 will delve into
the mechanisms by which Dach1 stimulates artery endothelial cell differentiation and morphogenesis.
 This work is significant because delineating how developmental signals stimulate coronary artery
regeneration could ultimately contribute to therapeutic interventions for heart disease. The work is innovative
because it takes a new approach to revascularization—targeting artery differentiation rather than just the
microvasculature. It also further develops cutting edge experimental techniques such as adult whole organ
imaging and a novel in vitro endothelial cell differentiation model, which could ultimately benefit the
cardiovascular research community at large. Finally, successful completion of the Aims is ensured by the
interdisciplinary environment at Stanford University and collaborative track record between this group of
investigators (Drs. Kristy Red-Horse, Kyle Loh, Alison Marsden, and Daniel Bernstein). The proposed work
will enhance our knowledge on cardiovascular development and regeneration by illuminating the biology of
the hitherto-enigmatic collateral arteries, as well as how transcriptional regulators such as DACH1 determine
artery fate."

10898930,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
GPCRs form the largest membrane protein family and also dominate the therapeutic market as targets for
more than 30% of FDA-approved drugs. These drugs act on a broad spectrum of indications from cancer to
inflammatory, cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal disease. GPCRs are archetypical allosteric
proteins that translate extracellular ligand stimulation into an intracellular response. In contrast to the binary “on
or off” response of most signaling molecules, GPCRs possess a ligand-independent basal activity that can be
increased or decreased upon ligand binding, and then further regulated by allosteric modulators. Activated
receptors transduce signals through G protein and arrestin proteins equally (balanced signaling) or selectively
(biased signaling). Taken together, a single receptor may specifically recognize several ligands and respond
uniquely to each, creating a complex conformational landscape. The last decade has seen nearly 300 X-ray
and cryo-EM structures have greatly expanded our view of GPCR architecture and function; however, the
molecular mechanisms of basal activity, partial agonism, biased signaling, and allosteric modulation can only
be partially derived from these structures. The principles of class Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) and
dynamically-drive (DD) allostery can significantly enhance our understanding of, and ability to tune, GPCR
signaling. Whereas classic MWC conformational allostery is relatively simple to infer from X-ray or cryo-EM
structural models, DD allostery is far more difficult to measure experimentally. Advances in NMR spectroscopy
relaxation measurements have empirically-demonstrated that sidechain methyl dynamics can be used as a
proxy for conformational entropy (i.e. DD allostery). In addition, it remains the only technique capable of
quantifying atomic-resolution motions across the picosecond to second timescale and in many cases can
detect states populated as little as 0.5%. We propose two research projects aimed at exploring the allosteric
role of MWC and DD allosteric mechanisms in the activation of 1) peptide-binding GPCRs and 2) arrestin.
There is immense therapeutic potential in the ability to tune receptor signaling using partial or biased agonists
in contrast to full agonists/antagonists – and it remains virtually untapped. Our proposal provides a much-
needed complement to decades of functional mutant screens, EPR, fluorescent labels, and high-resolution
structures. In the long-term, the goal of our research program is to describe the conformational transitions and
dynamics of the greater GPCR superfamily from the inactive state to the active state unhindered by crystal
contacts or stabilizing proteins."
10874455,"Abstract. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, which is caused
by inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene and affects multiple organs, including kidney
and lung. The disease affects over two million people worldwide, with a large proportion developing
angiomyolipomata and cysts, which eventually lead to renal failure. While the initial genetic events of TSC
have been delineated, little is known about the biological processes and factors that facilitate progression
or expansion of cysts. We have developed mice with kidney principal (PC) cell-specific inactivation of Tsc1
or Tsc2 genes (Published and Prelim. Data) which recapitulate the human TSC cystic kidney disease. The
cyst epithelia display few PC cells, but robust presence of A-intercalated (A-IC) cells.
 RNA-seq and confirmatory expression studies demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of
Foxi1, a transcription factor critical to the development of IC cells and activation of H+-ATPase and carbonic
anhydrase II (CAII) in Tsc1 KO mice. Double immunofluorescent labeling studies with antibodies against
H+-ATPase and AQP2; H+-ATPase and PCNA (proliferative nuclear cell antigen, a marker of cell
proliferation) and H+-ATPase and CAII demonstrated progressive loss of PC cells and hyperproliferation
of A-IC cells in cyst epithelium in Tsc1 KO mice. In addition, the electrogenic 2Cl-/H+ exchanger CLC-5,
which colocalizes with H+-ATPase in membranes of late endosomes and lysosomes under basal conditions,
demonstrated remarkable co-localization with H+-ATPase on the apical membrane of cyst epithelia in Tsc1
KO mice. Further, our results indicated the co-localization of pro-renin receptor PRR, a critical player in
Wnt signaling pathway, with H+-ATPase on the apical membrane of cyst epithelia. These changes are
distinct from those in autosomal dominant PKD cysts (Prelim Data).
 Deletion of Foxi1 in Tsc1 KO mice resulted in complete abrogation of cyst burden in Foxi1/Tsc1 double
mutant mice. In addition, deletion of CAII, which is regulated by Foxi1 and is critical to H+-ATPase activity,
significantly blunted the cyst burden in CAII/Tsc1 double mutant mice.
 We propose that the robust proliferation of A-intercalated cells and their acid/base/electrolyte transport
machinery are crucial to kidney cystogenesis in Tsc1 KO mice. We further propose that unlike cysts in PKD,
which respond to AVP V2 receptor antagonism by reduction in their fluid secretion and size, TSC cysts,
which have few principal cells, will be resistant to V2 receptor antagonists.
 To test our hypotheses, we propose to: Ascertain the role of A-IC cells and their acid base transport
machinery (H+-ATPase and CAII) in the growth and expansion of cysts in TSC disease; Determine the role
of CLC-5 and CFTR in chloride secretion into cyst lumen and cyst expansion in mice with TSC; and Examine
the effect of inhibitors of CAII/H+-ATPase, PRR and mTOR on cyst growth in TSC mice. To this end, we
will examine the effect of simultaneous deletion of Tsc1 (in principal cells) in combination with Foxi1, CAII,
H+-ATPase B subunit, or CLC-5 on renal cystogenesis. Further, the effect of pharmacologic inhibitors of
CFTR activation (V2 receptor antagonists), H+-ATPase/CAII (acetazolamide), PRR (the handle region
peptide) or mTORC (everolimus) will be explored to determine their effect on cyst expansion in Tsc1 KO
mice. Cyst growth and size, kidney function, systemic blood pressure, life expectancy, as well as mTORC1
activation in cyst epithelium will be determined in mutant mice. We strongly believe the proposed studies
are novel and could lead to new therapies for this devastating disease as well as a number of other renal
cystic diseases."
10872814,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The alphavirus Mayaro virus (MAYV) is a mosquito-borne human pathogen that causes febrile illness and
arthralgia in Latin America but has not produced widespread outbreaks like related chikungunya virus (CHIKV).
MAYV infections probably occur after exposure to infected forest-dwelling vector mosquito species. Previous
outbreaks of both CHIKV and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV, another alphavirus) were mediated
by viral mutations that confer adaptation to urban-abundant mosquito species, which facilitated forest-to-city
spillover promoting urban epidemics. One reason MAYV has not produced widespread epidemics may be that
anthropophilic urban Aedes (Ae.) aegypti and Ae. albopictus are incompetent MAYV vectors. Multiple
laboratory vector competence studies from different continents show MAYV poorly infects both species where
doses required for infection are at the higher end or above human viremia levels. Epidemics could result if
MAYV adapts to increase infection and transmission at lower ingested doses in either urban Ae. species since
an increase in mosquito susceptibility means that infected people with low viremias are infectious to
mosquitoes, which can potentiate mosquito-human-mosquito cycling. In earlier studies, we used serial
passaging and sequencing to identify an envelope (E) gene CHIKV mutant know to lower the oral infectious
dose and increase transmission by Ae. albopictus. This work demonstrates the power of experimental
evolution to retrospectively identify epidemiologically relevant alphavirus mutations. However, similar studies
have not been performed for MAYV. The goal of this project is to assess the potential for Mayaro virus to
adapt to urban mosquito vectors using an experimental evolution approach. We hypothesize that MAYV
can adapt via serial Ae. mosquito and alternating Ae.-mouse-Ae. passage to 1) increase infection of and
transmission by Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes at lower ingested doses; 2) maintain
transmissibility during alternating cycling; and 3) accrue E gene mutations that augment Ae. infection and
transmission. These hypotheses will be tested by assessing the potential for MAYV adaptation to and
sustained cycling via urban Ae. by (Aim 1A): evaluating fitness of MAYV serially passaged in Ae. aegypti and
albopictus mosquitoes, (Aim 1B): evaluating fitness of MAYV alternately passaged between Ae. and mice, and
(Aim 1C): identifying mutations that arise during MAYV passage and evaluating mutant fitness in mosquitoes.
This project represents the first experimental evolution studies for MAYV in Ae.. Understanding the potential for
adaptation is important to define the risk of future MAYV outbreaks mediated by novel vector use. Knowledge
of mutations that confer MAYV adaptation to Ae. can be used to define mechanisms of increased mosquito
infection and transmission, for inclusion in MAYV vaccine development, and as a target for genomic
surveillance. The use of experimental evolution to predict virus adaptation can lead to a paradigm shift to
enable proactive measures to prevent virus epidemics."
10872391,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive inherited leukodystrophy caused by the mutations in ASPA
gene encoding the aspartoacylase enzyme, leading to loss of enzyme activity and increased concentrations of
its substrate N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the brain. The abnormally high levels of NAA result in spongiform
degeneration of white matter, aberrant myelination, brain edema, macrocephaly, and severe cognitive and motor
deficits. Currently, there is no cure or disease-modifying treatment for CD. There is an urgent need for effective
therapies for patients with CD. Aspartate N-acetyltransferase encoded by the NAT8L gene catalyzes
biosynthesis of NAA from aspartate and acetyl-CoA. We and others postulated that brain-penetrant NAT8L
inhibitors could reduce brain NAA levels and alleviate the NAA-driven pathology in CD. Indeed, genetic disruption
of NAT8L in CD mouse model (Aspanur7nur7) was found to show strong therapeutic benefit. Currently, however,
there are no small molecule NAT8L inhibitors that penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Through a large HTS
screening campaign followed by preliminary medicinal chemistry efforts, however, our team identified a novel
sub-micromolar and brain penetrant NAT8L inhibitor structurally distinct from previously reported inhibitors. To
capitalize on this discovery, herein we propose to advance this project to the next stage, where the focus will be
on optimizing the lead compound for desirable pharmacological properties (R61 Phase), enabling in vivo efficacy
studies in a murine model of CD (R33 Phase). We are poised to seize this opportunity and establish in vivo proof
of concept using a potent, selective, brain-penetrable NAT8L inhibitor to treat CD by executing the following
three Specific Aims: (R61 Phase Aim 1) Conduct structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on the lead NAT8L
inhibitor; (R61 Phase Aim 2) Conduct in vitro characterization and in vivo pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
(PK/PD) profiling of potent NAT8L inhibitors from Aim 1; (R33 Phase Aim 3) Assess in vivo efficacy of the
optimized NAT8L inhibitor in an established murine model of CD."

This proposal seeks partial support for the 2024 Enzymes, Coenzymes, and Metabolic Pathways GRC/GRS.
These meetings are scheduled for July 27–28 (GRS) and July 28–Aug 2 (GRC) at the Waterville Valley Resort,
in Waterville Valley, NH. The “Enzymes” GRC/GRS is the paramount conference for scientists investigating the
structure and function of enzymes and their role as the metabolic basis of diseases ranging from cancer to
neurodegeneration. The long-term goals of these conferences are to facilitate methodological, intellectual, and
interpersonal connections borne from the characterization of enzymes’ roles in life’s essential biological
processes. To reach these goals, the GRC has developed a technical program of 36 speakers (28 invited and 8
selected from poster abstracts), and the GRS has assembled a program of 9 speakers (1 invited and 8 chosen
from poster abstracts) as well as a Bioscience Careers Panel consisting of ~5 leaders from various backgrounds.
These oral presentations will disclose the most recent findings in enzymology, experimental method
development, as well as how these are implicated in disease. The GRC Chairs have emphasized that these
scholars derive from a diverse and inclusive backgrounds: with more than half of the scheduled speakers being
women, while several others are from underrepresented groups. The disciplinary program will ensure
participants are intellectually diverse – with sessions centered on neurobiochemical enzymology and method
development, and also drug discovery for both infectious and non-infectious diseases. As such, we anticipate
recruiting attendees from a similarly wide expanse of diverse backgrounds. In addition to the speaking slots,
afternoon poster sessions provide an opportunity for all attendees to share their discoveries with the broader
scientific community. Of particular importance is that these poster sessions encourage close interactions among
both junior and senior investigators, which we further reinforce by having senior investigators aid in judging
poster presentations by all participating trainees. This proposal has high significance because the “Enzymes”
GRC is a pivotal conference for researchers investigating the mechanisms of biochemical reactions where, as
yet unpublished findings at the forefront of the fields of biochemistry and biophysics are shared. A major outcome
of these conferences will be the further expansion of the community of researchers investigating how enzymes,
co-enzymes, and metabolic pathways contribute to the development of new therapeutics, especially for the
treatment of infectious diseases, cancer, and CNS dysfunction."
10901349,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is associated with loss-of-function mutations in the
Methyl CPG Binding Protein 2 (MeCP2) gene. MeCP2 is a methyl-reader protein that forms a bridge between
methylated DNA and larger chromatin structure. As a result, mutations in MeCP2 result in the disruption of
thousands of genes, making it difficult to identify those that are pathogenic and those that are transcriptional
noise. Traditionally, RTT is first diagnosed clinically and then confirmed through the identification of mutations in
the MECP2 gene. However, ~5% of RTT patients are found to be MeCP2-mutation-negative (atypical RTT),
despite sharing overlapping symptomology with typical RTT. We hypothesized that genes with conserved
disruption in typical and atypical patient populations would identify those most critical to their shared clinical
presentation. Using a cohort of 44 autopsy samples from RTT patients, we identified 5 that were MeCP2-
mutation-negative. We then conducted differential RNA sequencing on these samples relative to 6 typical RTT
samples and 9 neurotypical controls. These experiments revealed that pathways associated with heat shock
(HS) signaling are dramatically elevated in both populations. When we assessed all 44 autopsy samples,
elevated HS signaling was enriched in typical RTT patients with severe, truncating mutations and not mild,
missense mutations. As both patient groups exhibited the same protracted death process, the differential
expression of HS proteins suggests that it is not an artifact, but rather a bona fide component of RTT. We
hypothesize that increased HS signaling contributes to severe phenotypes in RTT, and we will test this
hypothesis in Aim 1 by 1) genetically diminishing the HS response (HSR) from conception in a mouse model of
RTT to assess whether phenotypes become milder, and 2) pharmacologically normalizing the HSR to determine
whether it rescues existing phenotypes. Mechanistically, MeCP2 is known to regulate baseline gene expression
by controlling the rate of transcriptional initiation. We hypothesize that MeCP2 regulates the expression of
activity-dependent genes, like HSPs, in an identical manner. In Aim 2 we will first determine the scope of gene
disruption following thermal stimulation using RNA-seq (Aim 2a), and then mirror those experiments with Pro-
seq on mice treated with the elongation inhibitor flavopiridol (Aim 2b). Together, these experiments will identify
which stress response genes are affected by the loss of MeCP2, and establish whether their change in
expression is associated with impairments in transcriptional initiation, thereby providing a mechanistic
complement to the therapeutically relevant experiments outlined in Aim 1. This proposal has been designed to
provide extensive training in neuropharmacology, behavioral neuroscience, and bioinformatics which I have
identified as critical for my career development. My mentors and I have developed a training plan composed of
didactic and technical training to prepare me for an independent career in academic research."
10873580,"Little is known about the immediate early events of the human papillomavirus (HPV) lifecycle. This is mostly due
to the lack of a cell culture model allowing efficient infection of primary keratinocytes and at the same time a
genetic analysis of viral factors. We have recently described such a system using 293TT-derived HPV16
quasivirions and extracellular matrix (ECM)-to-cell transfer that achieves highly efficient infection of primary
keratinocytes. Infected cells support the complete viral lifecycle when subjected to growth in organotypic raft
cultures and the system is amenable to genetic screening of viral factors. Current models suggest that the human
papillomavirus undergoes three modes of replication during a complete life cycle. During the establishment
phase, incoming viral genome is amplified to reach up to several hundred episomal genome copies. During
maintenance, genome copy number is maintained. Mechanistically, post-transcriptional and -translational
regulation of the viral E1 replication function as well as the E8^E2 repressor have been suggested to be important
for genome maintenance. Lastly, differentiation-induced genome amplification in the late stages of the viral life
cycle results in amplification of viral genome to thousands of copies. Rather than using a bidirectional mode of
replication, a rolling circle mode of replication was suggested. Using an infection model combined with highly
sensitive in situ detection of viral genome, which we developed in the last funding period, we have recently made
unexpected discoveries: (i) HPV16 and HPV31 viral genome is amplified in each S phase during the maintenance
stage in monolayer cell culture; (ii) a significant fraction of viral genome is lost to the cytosol during mitosis by
failing to tether to mitotic chromosomes; lost nuclear viral genome is replenished in the next S phase; (iii)
cytosolic viral genome is also detected in organotypic raft cultures; (iv) cytosolic viral genome is degraded during
G1 and S phase by a lysosomal pathway likely utilizing (micro)autophagy; (v) E7 protein is required for efficient
degradation of the cytosolic viral genome; (vi) cytosolic viral genome fails to induce cGAS/STING signaling
despite a functioning cGAS/STING signaling pathway in HPV harboring keratinocytes. Our findings suggest that
genome maintenance is regulated at the tethering level. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that genome
copy number maintenance is regulated through restricted genome tethering to host cell chromosomes during
mitosis rather than being regulated by replication initiation. The degradation of cytosolic genomes resets genome
copy number after each mitosis. This immediately opens questions that regard the factor(s) that are limiting viral
genomes tethering to mitotic chromosomes, the mechanism by which degradation of cytosolic viral genome is
occurring, and why cytosolic viral genome does not induce innate immune signaling. We propose three specific
aims to test the hypothesis. We will identify and characterize the mechanism by which genome retention is
restricted; we will delineate the pathway by which viral genome is degraded and define E7 protein functions
essential for this process; and define the mechanism by which cGAS/STING pathway activation is prevented."
10874447,"This project is focused on the cellular and molecular changes caused by traumatic brain injury
(TBI), specifically those affecting GABAergic signaling in the hippocampus. Maladaptive changes in
cellular and molecular properties contribute to the cognitive and neuropsychiatric sequelae of TBI, and
epileptic seizures. The chronic cellular and molecular alterations causing dysfunction after TBI, and the
proximal factors triggered by TBI that induce these chronic changes, are incompletely understood.
Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, serve beneficial functions in the healthy brain but in
response to injury their actions can be maladaptive, injurious, and magnify the consequences of TBI.
As such, microglia and their inflammatory signaling are candidate factors to trigger pathophysiological
cellular and molecular changes after TBI. Prior work has established that downregulation of
extrasynaptic GABA receptors is a consistent feature of TBI in the hippocampus. Experiments proposed
here will test the hypotheses that: i) attenuation of microglia activation will limit TBI-induced changes
in extrasynaptic GABA receptor expression and function and ii) attenuation of microglia activation will
decrease the incidence of spontaneous seizures after TBI (epileptogenesis).
 Using a combination of patch-clamp electrophysiology and immunohistochemical techniques,
the expression and function of extrasynaptic GABA receptors (both GABAA and GABAB) in hippocampal
neurons will be assessed in a model of severe TBI (controlled cortical impact, CCI). To assess the role
of microglia in these molecular alterations after TBI, a powerful pharmacological tool that dramatically
depletes brain microglia will be used (PLX5622, a CSF1-R inhibitor). PLX5622-treated animals will be
exposed to CCI, allowing the assessment of whether functional molecular alterations after TBI are
dependent on microglia activation. Specifically, the proposed experiments will determine if changes in
extasynaptic GABA receptors after TBI are dependent on microglia activation. As part of this aim, other
areas affected by TBI (thalamus, cerebellum) will be examined for CCI-associated changes in
extrasynaptic GABA receptor function.
 The cellular effects of TBI and outcomes will also be investigated to assess their dependence on
microglia activation. Using the approach of depleting microglia with PLX5622 prior to CCI, the time
course and magnitude of neuronal death after TBI (for all neurons and specific interneuronal subtypes)
will be determined for control and PLX5622-treated animals. Mossy fiber sprouting (the
pathophysiological arborizing response of DGGC axons to injury) is another cellular change that occurs
as a consequence of TBI; mossy fiber sprouting will be quantified and compared between the two
groups. The cellular and molecular changes proposed for study here are all believed to contribute to
epileptogenesis and seizures, but irrespective of these specific cellular/molecular changes the
recognition of significant microglia-dependent effects on epileptogenesis after CCI is of greatest
importance. Video-EEG monitoring will be used to determine the incidence of spontaneous seizures
(i.e. epilepsy) and seizure characteristics after CCI in control and PLX5622-treated animals. These data
will provide evidence to support (or refute) a significant role of microglia in epileptogenesis after CCI.
These insights are needed to inform areas of future investigation and therapeutic approaches."

Acoustic microvortices instrumentation for dosage controlled, high efficiency cell engineering
Abstract - In years 2018 and 2020, Nobel Prizes were awarded to pioneers in cancer immunotherapy
and the gene editing CRISPR-Cas9 method. This has ushered in a new era of cell engineering that
demands technological innovations to produce genetic-modified and reprogrammed immune cells (e.g.,
T cells). CAR T cell immunotherapy is one type of cell therapy that has already achieved success in
the clinic for treating cancer. The holy grail is to produce universal CAR T cells, genetically modified
and engineered allogeneic T cells derived from healthy donors that avoid immunologic rejection. This
requires gene engineering techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9 that can deliver multiplex gene insertions
and knock-outs with controlled dosage to enhance viability and efficacy of the engineered cells.
Although viral vectors are the method of choice for cell engineering, there are major concerns over their
safety as well as the complex, costly preparation process. Nonviral transfection methods are
alternatives to viral vectors that avoid the deleterious byproducts such as immune-mediated toxicity
and oncogenic transgene concerns. Here we introduce the Acoustic-Electric Shear Orbiting Poration
(AESOP) platform that addresses several of the known challenges for nonviral transfection techniques,
including cell viability and dosage-controlled intracellular delivery while achieving relatively high
throughput. AESOP is based on a microfluidic platform termed “lateral cavity acoustic transducers
(LCATs)” that can form an array of microvortices activated by acoustic energy. The main innovation
of the AESOP platform is the trapping of suspended populations of cells in tunable 3-D
microvortices and incorporating a two-step membrane disruption strategy to precisely
permeabilize cell membranes. By trapping cells to tumble in whirlpool-like microvortices, this platform
optimizes the delivery of intended cargo sizes with uniform poration of the cell membranes via
mechanical shear followed by the modulated enlargement of these nanopores via electric field. Using
AESOP, we will focus on technology development for producing the universal CAR T cells. By
controlling dosage, a decreased amount of CRISPR reagents in cells could reduce off-target effects.
Furthermore, the uniform delivery enables the delivery of large cargo sizes necessary for
immunotherapy-related gene transfection and gene editing. This 4-year project has four specific
aims: 1- Generate acoustic microstreaming vortices for uniform cell membrane nanopores and
uniform local mixing; 2- Demonstrate uniform electric field enlargement of nanopores for cargo
delivery; 3- Design prototype AESOP instrumentation and 4- Quantitative benchmark of AESOP
for intracellular delivery of large size cargos with dosage control for the development of
universal CAR T cells."
10903550,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cell-cycle exit can be either transient (quiescence) or permanent (senescence), and these different states
are thought to have distinct molecular characteristics. Further, quiescence itself is not a single homogeneous
state as cells that remain quiescent for longer durations of time move progressively “deeper” into quiescence,
taking longer to return to the cell cycle upon stimulation. While senescent cancer cells are tumor suppressive as
they limit the proliferation of damaged cells and recruit the immune system, quiescent cancer cells are a source
of drug resistance as they evade chemotherapeutic treatments targeted at cycling cells and retain their ability to
proliferate in the future. The mechanisms controlling quiescence depth and the relationship between deep
quiescence and senescence are still poorly understood due to the lack of robust biomarkers and necessity for
single-cell assays to study questions of reversibility. However, there is a critical need for such studies as
chemotherapeutic treatment results in a mix of these cell fates. By using a functional readout that gets at the
core of what it means to be senescent: the long-term total lack of cell-cycle entry or progression, we found that
a subset of cells pushed into deep quiescence fail to return to the cell cycle after release from treatment and that
cells induced to deep quiescence by four different treatments for 2-12 days showed increasing levels of SA-βgal,
the gold standard marker of senescence. Thus, we hypothesize that 1) senescence is a deep quiescence from
which cells will never reawaken and 2) the transition between deep quiescence and senescence is marked by a
decrease in the ratio between pro-proliferative signaling (Cyclin D) and anti-proliferative signaling (p21/p27),
mediating the progressive decrease in probability of cell-cycle re-entry. Experiments proposed in Aim 1 will use
time-lapse microscopy paired with post-hoc immunofluorescence imaging to measure canonical markers of
senescence in cells that remain permanently arrested after release from deep quiescence. In Aim 2 we will
perform RNA-sequencing on the subset of permanently arrested cells from Aim 1 and compare the
transcriptomes to existing gene signatures for senescent cells. Finally, we will use time-lapse microscopy of
biosensors for Cyclin D and p21/p27 to determine if the ratio of these signals predicts future cell-cycle re-entry.
Collectively, these aims will help define the relationship between quiescence and senescence and contribute to
a much needed quantitative and mechanistic understanding of how cells transition between transient, prolonged,
and permanent cell-cycle withdrawal. If successful, the proposed work will aid in the development of more
targeted and effective chemotherapy treatments and provide more accurate biomarkers to determine which cells
will and will not proliferate in the future."
10898540,"Novel Regenerative Therapeutic in Chronic Complex TBI
Allopregnanolone (ALLO) is a neurosteroid endogenously produced in brain that exhibits pleiotropic actions
highly relevant to the neurobiology and treatment of chronic complex TBI. ALLO exhibits pronounced
regenerative actions, in addition to marked neuroprotective, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory effects in rodent
models. Furthermore, our recent human data suggest that ALLO is decreased in TBI, suggesting that
ameliorating deficits of this neurosteroid may be clinically therapeutic. We have also recently determined that
ALLO levels are positively correlated with cortical gray matter thickness on MRI. In addition, multiple groups
have now reported reductions in ALLO among patients with conditions that frequently co-occur with TBI,
including depression and pain disorders. Replenishing ALLO could thus have tremendous therapeutic
promise for multiple symptom constellations that greatly impact functional outcome and quality of life.
The goal of this project is thus to conduct a proof-of-concept Phase 2 randomized controlled trial (RCT) in
Veterans with chronic complex TBI to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of this regenerative therapeutic,
providing critical foundational data in this population that could lead to a novel treatment addressing the
multidimensional pathophysiological underpinnings of TBI and frequently co-occurring conditions such as
depression and pain. This study will therefore provide initial data for the potential therapeutic efficacy of ALLO
for co-occurring depression symptoms and pain symptoms (primary endpoints), as well as possible
enhancement of functional outcome (secondary endpoint). In addition, we will examine TBI-only groups
without depression or pain symptoms (also randomized to ALLO or placebo). This will now thus be a 4-arm
study with 22 participants per group (88 total participants): Complex TBI groups (randomized to ALLO or
placebo) and TBI-only groups (randomized to ALLO or placebo). As ALLO has anti-inflammatory actions, we
will also investigate possible reductions in inflammatory biomarkers post-treatment (exploratory endpoint) and
heart rate variability (exploratory endpoint). In addition, we will obtain important pharmacokinetic data for this
intervention (ALLO levels to be quantified by mass spectrometry).
Veterans with chronic complex TBI and a minimum HAM-D score of 14 (consistent with moderate depression)
will be randomized to either intravenous placebo (6% cyclodextrin) or ALLO (0.5mg/ml of GMP-grade ALLO in
6% cyclodextrin); n=22 per group/n=44 with complex TBI. We will also randomize Veterans with TBI-only (no
depression or pain symptoms) to ALLO or placebo; n=22 per group/n=44 with TBI-only. Total study number
of OEF/OIF/OND Veteran participants with mild TBI will now be 88 (4 arms; 22 participants per group).
Following a loading dose, Veterans will receive a 4-hour placebo or ALLO infusion targeted to achieve a serum
ALLO level of 50 nanomolar (nM), which has been well-tolerated in small studies of other populations to date.
Participants will receive intensive monitoring throughout the study, including continuous ECG. Blood will be
drawn at hourly intervals during the infusion and 6 hours post-infusion to determine the pharmacokinetic
parameters of ALLO in this cohort. As the potential antidepressant effect of ALLO may be very rapid, we will
conduct behavioral assessments during the infusion, 6 hours post-infusion, and 24 hours post-infusion. In
addition, we will examine these symptom constellations 7 days and 14 days post-infusion.
We hypothesize that ALLO will be efficacious and well-tolerated in these chronic complex TBI and TBI-only
populations, and that this intervention will have rapid antidepressant and analgesic actions (in addition to
positive effects on functional outcome). We also hypothesize that inflammatory markers and improvements in
heart rate variability may predict clinical response to this therapeutic candidate."

10896634,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Excess dietary salt is associated with increased risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD), the
leading cause of death in the United States. High dietary salt is also associated with increased chronic kidney
disease (CKD) risk, another leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Yet, 90% of adults consume excess dietary
salt based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommendation. Americans struggle to reduce their salt
intake because the vast majority (~70%) of dietary salt comes from processed foods and meals prepared at
restaurants, making it difficult to alter their dietary salt. As a result, there have been calls for alternative strategies
to counteract excess consumption of dietary salt. We have identified Beta-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) as a
promising tool to counteract the adverse cardiorenal health effects of high dietary salt. β-OHB is a ketone body
typically produced during prolonged exercise, fasting, and ketogenic dieting. Alternatively, oral ketone
monoesters are a type of ketone supplement that are metabolized into β-OHB. While most individuals are unable
to adhere to strict ketogenic diets, oral ketone supplements are convenient, typically well tolerated, and increase
β-OHB to a similar or greater extent. Recent rat data suggests that high dietary salt suppresses β-OHB
production and that increasing β-OHB via ketone supplementation counteracts the adverse effects of high salt
on cardiorenal function. Similar to the published rodent data, our pilot data also indicate that high dietary salt
reduces fasting plasma β-OHB in humans. Recently published data also demonstrate that increasing β-OHB
with ketone supplementation can improve blood pressure and vascular function in humans under certain
contexts. However, it is unclear whether raising β-OHB via ketone supplementation can protect older humans
against the adverse cardiorenal effects of high dietary salt. Therefore, we are proposing to examine whether
taking a ketone monoester supplement concurrently with high salt for 10 days counteracts the adverse effects
of short-term high dietary salt on blood pressure (Aim 1), vascular function (Aim 2), and kidney injury and blood
flow (Aim 3). We will utilize a double masked, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design pilot trial in 30
older adults who will also undergo a low salt control intervention and high salt alone. The PI (Dr. Austin Robinson)
has a strong record of productivity investigating the cardiorenal consequences of short-term high dietary salt and
has assembled an outstanding interdisciplinary team of co-investigators and consultants to help secure future
R01 funding for this line of research. The public health impact of this innovative project is that establishing
strategies (e.g., ketone supplementation) to attenuate the adverse cardiorenal effects of high dietary salt could
lead to reductions in CVD and CKD risk and mortality."

The overall goal of the Genetic Engineering Core (GEC) is to support the needs of MARMO-AD
by providing services to (1) genetically engineer marmosets using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing,
(2) develop and optimize enabling technologies for germline gene editing in marmoset, and (3)
create fibroblast cell lines and differentiate them into induce neuronal stem cells and neurons.
The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World non-human primate with numerous
practical advantages in biomedical research and is quickly becoming a much sought-after model
organism by the neuroscience community. The rapidly growing appreciation of marmoset
neurobiology is synergizing with contemporaneous advances in gene editing techniques to
make marmosets the genetically engineered non-human primate of choice for understanding
brain function and to study brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s Disease. The GEC will provide
all services required to use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to produce novel genetically engineered
marmosets that harbor human high-risk alleles for early and late onset Alzheimer’s disease.
While creating these gene-edited animals, the GEC will simultaneously develop and optimize
enabling technologies for efficient germline gene editing. These technologies include novel
methods of ovarian stimulation to enhance production of mature marmoset oocytes, and novel
approaches to reduce mosaicism in gene edited marmosets. Improved technologies will reduce
the cost and increase the speed at which genetically engineered marmosets can be produced
while also reducing animal numbers. Lastly, the GEC will produce marmoset fibroblast cell lines
and differentiate them into induced neuronal stem cells and neurons. Cell lines will be used to
create DNA sequencing libraries and for in vitro phenotypic characterization of gene edited
animals in support of the Project goals."

equivalent) and non-clinician postdoctoral researchers who are capable of designing and testing innovative
hypothesis-driven clinical therapeutic research protocols in clinical trial settings (pilot/Phase I, Phase II and
Phase III trials). To do this, we have created a tightly structured and mentored education program within an
academically rigorous training environment that prepares the most compelling senior fellows or junior faculty in
clinical oncology for careers in patient oriented research. The program is anchored within our Comprehensive
Cancer Center and led by Olufunmilayo Olopade, MD along with Walter Stadler, MD with strong support from
an Executive Committee as well as Internal and External Advisory Committees. The 78 research training
faculty preceptors have NIH or equivalent peer- reviewed funding, interact on a number of collaborative
research and training efforts and are well qualified to serve as potential mentors for the five trainees per year
participating in this K12 program. Each trainee is appointed for a minimum of two years. In this renewal
application, we shall continue successful elements of the program in clinical pharmacology, genomics and
immunotherapy while enhancing training opportunities in emerging fields of clinical informatics, data science
and microbiome research. The Paul Calabresi K12 Scholars Program is our highly mentored, didactic
coursework-intensive program, and “hands on” clinical research training which results in a Master of Science in
Clinical Investigation. Leveraging clinical research infrastructure across University of Chicago Medicine, we
have also created a flexible set of integrated interdisciplinary courses in translational science that blends
entrepreneurships, cancer genomics, immunology, pharmacogenomics and community based clinical trials
network. Of the 18 trainees who have completed the program since 2010, 13 (72%) are currently in academic
careers, of whom 7 (54%) hold appointments at the Associate Professor level. Moreover, these 18 trainees
have published a total of 176 oncology research papers, and are Principal Investigators or Co-Investigators on
56 oncology research grant awards. Of significance, 7 of 14 (50%) appointments to the program in the last
funding cycle were women or members of underserved minority groups. An explicit goal of this Paul
Calabresi Scholars program, as with all training programs in our institution, is that its training opportunities
and benefits will extend far beyond the relatively few scholars whose stipends it will provide. The program
has had a transformative and global impact and is reaching into the larger oncology trainee community in
Chicago and to trainees in other countries who come to our Institution as Global Oncology Scholars. Thus,
the benefit that accrues from the program's implementation and productivity is substantial and will
increase the number of highly skilled clinicians and non-clinicians conducting cancer clinical trials."
10899613,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Dopamine (DA) signaling in the striatum, the main input to the basal
ganglia, is critical for instrumental learning, a process involving associations of stimuli, responses, and outcomes.
DA dysfunction results in diverse symptoms in disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, Parkinson’s
Disease, and addiction, which are often attributed to an imbalance in distinct instrumental learning processes.
Anatomically segregated subregions of the striatum are thought to support stimulus-outcome (S-O), stimulus-
response (S-R), and response-outcome (R-O) associations. Further, while the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is
necessary for flexible goal-directed behavior, the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) supports automatic, outcome-
independent habitual behavior. While dopamine (DA) is typically thought to encode a reward prediction error
(RPE), a teaching signal which drives associative learning, studies suggest that DA release dynamics vary
depending on the target region. However, it is unknown how natural spatiotemporal DA release dynamics support
learning distinct stimulus, response, and outcome associations. These gaps hinder the development of targeted
diagnostics and treatments for dopamine-dysfunction affecting distinct striatum regions.
 This proposed project will make strides toward understanding the functional and computational
significance of spatially varying DA dynamics in distinct associative learning processes. A behavioral paradigm
which requires mice to switch from a cue-dependent S-R strategy to a cue-independent strategy based on recent
actions and outcomes will enable classification of behavior strategy across timescales. This behavioral paradigm
will be combined with a new multi optical fiber photometry method to record DA release dynamics throughout
the volume of the striatum as mice learn and update distinct stimulus, response and outcome contingencies.
This new large-scale, cell-type specific recording method will be applied to establish a spatial map of distinct DA
RPE correlates and can be adapted to record distributed cell-type specific dynamics of any brain region with
high spatiotemporal resolution. Finally, this method will be advanced with a digital mirror device (DMD) to target
light to large, yet spatially precise, regions of the striatum for optogenetic manipulation which mimics the spatial
scale and resolution of natural DA release dynamics.
 Completion of this project will support practical and theoretical training in three main areas: behavioral
testing and analysis, functional circuit analysis, and technology development. Dr. Mark Howe (sponsor) will
provide mentorship and training in in vivo analysis of neural circuits and dynamics. Dr. David Boas (co-sponsor),
the director of the Neurophotonics Center at Boston University, will provide training in the concepts and
techniques used for optical neuro-engineering, which will augment training supported by the NSF
Neurophotonics National Research Traineeship Program. The Graduate Program for Neuroscience (GPN) at
Boston University will provide additional training while fostering a collaborative and interdisciplinary environment."
10899615,"Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) reduces overdose risk and is filling a niche for opioid addicted
patients that do not want agonist maintenance or cannot access it. However transitioning to naltrexone
requires detoxification, which is a major hurdle. Methadone or buprenorphine tapers are effective but require a
7 to 14-day opioid-free interval before starting naltrexone, leaving ample time to relapse. Non-opioid
detoxification with an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist may shorten the time, and lofexidine was recently
approved for this indication. It is safer than clonidine however like clonidine, it does not reduce the subjective
effects of withdrawal and patients do not like it. A medication that better targets these symptoms may improve
outcomes and increase the proportion that transition to XR-NTX. Pregabalin may be such a medication. It
potentiates the activity of glutamic acid decarboxylase, inhibits calcium influx and release of excitatory
neurotransmitters, raises GABA levels, and is approved for neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, adjunctive therapy
for adults with partial onset seizures and in Europe, for anxiety. It was not controlled in Russia for several
years but was placed on their equivalent of our Schedule V due to reports that opioid addicted persons were
using it to reduce withdrawal and abuse. Based on this information, Krupitsky and colleagues randomized 34
consenting, heroin-addicted inpatients under double-blind conditions to pregabalin or clonidine-based
detoxification protocols. More pregabalin than clonidine patients completed detoxification (p = 0.01) and
pregabalin patients had better retention than clonidine patients (p = 0.001) with no differences in adverse
events.
 Here we propose to see if pregabalin can be combined with lofexidine to better reduce the subjective
effects of opioid withdrawal than lofexidine, and increase the proportion that transition to XR-NTX. Such a
dosing combination could lower the detoxification hurdle for patients who are interested in antagonist treatment
or who are in settings where it is unavailable or difficult to access. This work will require two phases, and both
fit into the UG3/UH3 announcement. In UG3 we will study pregabalin/lofexidine combinations to identify one
that reduces withdrawal-related subjective effects without generating more serious adverse events than
lofexidine alone. In UH3 we will test that combination in an adequately powered trial to determine if it
increases the number of patients that complete detoxification and transition to XR-NTX. Hypotheses are that
we will identify a dosing combination that is safe and reduces opioid withdrawal to a greater degree than
lofexidine alone, and that this lofexidine/pregabalin combination will result in more patients completing
detoxification and transitioning to XR-NTX. The ultimate goal is to generate data to support new or modified
indications(s) and/or inclusion of new recommendations in product prescribing information to improve
detoxification outcome and increase the proportion that transition to XR-NTX"
10906079,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stochastic switches are a broad class of genetic mechanisms that enable single cells to switch certain genes
on and off randomly, without responding to their environment. Such switches are prevalent in pathogenic
bacteria, where they are often involved in generating diverse surface protein repertoires across the bacterial
population, which enables a subset of cells to avoid detection by the immune system. In general, stochastic
switches provide a strategy for survival in fluctuating environments, by maintaining subpopulations of cells in
pre-adapted states that are prepared for future, possibly unpredictable, environmental stresses. In particular,
these strategies are known to be important in antibiotic persistence, a non-genetic, reversible, physiological
state with enhanced tolerance for antibiotics that occurs in a subpopulation of bacterial cells.
This grant applies novel microfluidic devices that enable single cell observations persister cell lineages, with
transcriptomics, and bioinformatics to study three major facets of stochastic switching. We use microscopy and
synthetic biology to understand why bacterial aggregation, a behavior that enhances survival under
antimicrobial treatment, is regulated by stochastic switching, and how to reverse aggregate states using small
molecule inhibitors of key genetic pathways. We use a novel custom microfluidics setup that enables single-
cell lineage tracking on hundreds of thousands of cells to observe antibiotic persister states that could not
previously be observed, and apply transcriptomics to reveal molecular mechanisms of persistence. We use a
new population genetic approach to modeling bacterial recombination, which can be flexibly applied to infer
recombination parameters from large-scale genomic and metagenomic sequencing datasets. We apply this
method to study how stochastic switching is influenced by recombination in the context of the human gut
microbiome.
The proposed research will substantially advance understanding of the role of stochastic switches,
aggregation, and recombination in bacterial adaptation. Through its emphasis on precise quantification using
powerful single cell microfluidics and microscopy, the research will yield new avenues to address antibiotic
persistence of bacteria, to perturb bacterial aggregated states, and to understand how the human gut
environment selects for and maintains antibiotic resistance and surface antigen genes."
10906081,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is typically detected at late stage due to absence of a cancer
screening strategy, with concomitant poor survival rates. Detection of PDAC at an early stage positively impacts
survival, and currently screening in eligible high-risk individuals (HRIs) defined by family history and germline
mutation status is considered best practice. The overall goal of this proposal is to use knowledge gained during
the last grant period to considerably enhance our ability to develop and validate the diagnostic performance of
new blood protein and methylated DNA (MDM) biomarkers for early detection of PDAC, using prospective
specimen collection and retrospective blinded evaluation (PRoBE) compliant methods. We hypothesize that a
combination of proteins, MDMs, and CA19-9 will accurately identify early stage PDAC in HRIs. We will assess
the performance characteristics of our approaches in early stage and pre-diagnostic phase of PDAC and identify
approaches that are optimized for clinical translation as an early detection tool using HRIs. For over two decades,
Mayo Clinic’s prospective biospecimen resources have accrued, using standardized high-quality procedures,
well-annotated biospecimens from thousands of PDAC patients including those with germline mutations in
pancreas cancer susceptibility genes, high risk members in familial pancreatic cancer kindreds, patients with
high-risk pancreatic conditions, and healthy controls. We have also launched the PCDC Signature Protocols at
our center. Among those at risk with biospecimens who we have followed longitudinally over two decades,
incident PDAC cases have developed, enabling us to utilize novel approaches to address the challenges and
better design PRoBE phase 3 studies. Based on our findings in the last grant period, we now focus on tailoring
samples for PRoBE phase 2 studies and characterizing performance to improve phase 3 studies. Our approach
will allow us to assess, for example, variability in biomarker expression for intended use HRI settings, and
temporality of biomarker expression to improve the ability to detect early onset PDAC. Our Specific Aims are to:
1) Accrue formal biospecimen sets from blood sample products and pancreatic cyst fluid suitable for PCDC
biomarker studies; 2) Leverage our past knowledge and experience to develop new biomarker panels using
tailored phase 2 designs and incorporating covariates to refine detection (age, sex, race, smoking, personal
history of diabetes mellitus, symptoms at diagnosis) to optimize detection; and 3) Evaluate needed performance
parameters that will inform the design of a successful phase 3 study for PDAC in a surveillance setting of HRIs.
Our multidisciplinary team is committed to continue its leadership and contribution to the PCDC organization to
advance the early detection of pancreatic cancer. Our project leverages existing infrastructures and biospecimen
banks of pancreatic cancer and other pancreatic diseases at Mayo Clinic and University of Pennsylvania, and it
will extend new prospective collections of blood and pancreatic cyst fluid from patients, contributing to PCDC
Signature Protocol cohorts and a PCDC central biorepository."

HIV continues to spread, episodically, among minority groups, and mostly from people unaware of their
infection. To more efficiently locate undiagnosed people living with HIV for treatment, as well as to monitor
prevention efforts, better epidemiological techniques are needed. Our project brings together a team of
experienced researchers from clinical, molecular biology, epidemiological, mathematical, and evolutionary
fields. We will develop innovative epidemiological methods by combining evolutionary theory, multi-scale
dynamic modeling, artificial intelligence, and large-scale clinical and sequence data. In this renewal, we will
expand on our previous work on how HIV within-host evolutionary processes interact with epidemiological
dynamics. Having quantified the link between transmission history and the resulting HIV phylogeny among
hosts, we conceptualize the relationship between the evolution and epidemiology of HIV into three levels:
within-host, at transmission, and on the population epidemic level. Because essential processes of HIV biology
and evolution have been largely ignored when modeling the epidemic level, in aim 1 we examine within-host
processes that affect diversification. We will include recombination, selection, and latency in a new coalescent
within-host model to evaluate the impact on the epidemiological level. We will also quantify potential within-
host multi-directional selection pressures. In aim 2, we focus on mechanisms that occur around the time of
transmission. We will develop a new maximum likelihood method based on a forward-time probabilistic model
of transmission that improves the inference of transmission direction and time of transmission among multiple
hosts, and develop a transmission heterogeneity detection method to both assess overall possible
transmission heterogeneity among infected persons, as well as to detect where in a phylogeny super-
spreading may have occurred. In aim 3, we will develop machine learning methods to handle very large data
sets (103-106 patients), and use additional clinical and demographic data to augment phylogenies in order to
reconstruct the underlying transmission history. All three aims will involve advancements aimed at developing
and improving methods for the next generation of phylodynamic applications."
10906203,"ABSTRACT
Mechano-stimulation in the musculoskeletal system plays a major role in the homeostasis of all tissues and
organs. Particularly in tendons, the proper physiologic exercise load has an anabolic effect with increased
tenogenic gene expression in humans; however, the molecular mechanisms that sense mechanical stimuli
remain unclear. Piezo1 is a mechano-sensitive ion channel involved in mechano-sensing in various organs and
tissues; however, it has not yet been examined in tendons or ligaments. In mice, the R2482H mutation of
Piezo1 is an active form mimicking a gain-of-function (GOF) PIEZO1 variant found in humans. To test the
potential effects of Piezo1 in physical performance, we generated systemic GOF Piezo1 (Piezo1systemic-GOF)
mice, muscle-specific GOF Piezo1 (Piezo1muscle-GOF) mice, and tendon-specific GOF Piezo1 (Piezo1tendon-GOF)
mice and found that the jumping power of Piezo1tendon-GOF mice as well as Piezo1systemic-GOF mice at 12-weeks-
old was ~1.6 times greater than in both wild-type mice and Piezo1muscle-GOF mice. Consistent with this,
significantly altered macroscopic and histological phenotypes were observed in the tendons of Piezo1tendon-GOF
mice with increased tendon-specific gene expression. We also found that upregulation of aging related
ossification gene expression was significantly reduced in aged Piezo1tendon-GOF mice. This suggests that
constitutively enhanced PIEZO1 activity promotes physical performance via tendons/ligaments. These
preliminary data underlie our hypothesis that PIEZO1 acts as a critical mechano-sensor in tenocytes,
maintaining and promoting tendon/ligament functions by orchestrating tendon/ligament-specific gene
expression. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue the following Aims: Aim 1: Analyze the function of
Piezo1 in human and mouse tendon homeostasis and aging. We will examine the function of Piezo1 in
tenocytes for tendon homeostasis and in aging by morphological, histological and gene expression analysis of
tendons from Piezo1tendon-GOF mice and tendon specific loss of function (LOF) Piezo1 (Piezo1tendon-LOF) mice at
different aging points. We will also test the role of PIEZO1 in human tenocytes by transcriptome analysis with
PIEZO1 siRNA knockdown or a small molecule PIEZO1 activator. Aim 2: Evaluate the role of Piezo1 in
tenocytes on physiological performance and exercise in mice. We will evaluate the role of Piezo1 in
tenocytes to potentiate physical performance using postnatally induced tendon specific gain of function and
loss of function Piezo1 mice at different ages. Thereafter, we will examine whether this physical ability could be
strengthened by physiological exercise inducing anabolic mechanical stimulation. Aim 3: Analyze the
biomechanical properties of tendon that are regulated by Piezo1. We will uncover how the kinetic energy
for the enhanced jumping ability of the Piezo1tendon-GOF mouse is produced by biomechanical analysis of tendon
stored energy and muscle contraction power. Completion of these aims will support the concept that Piezo1
could be a therapeutic target to maintain or enhance structure and function of the musculoskeletal system."
10906205,"Abstract
Ribosomes are among the most ancient, intricate, and essential cellular machines whose function is to process
genetic information to generate cellular proteins. Human ribosomes are incredibly complex, consisting of 80
ribosomal proteins and four heavily modified ribosomal RNAs (rRNA), which must be precisely assembled.
Further, the largest pre-rRNA is transcribed from a polycistronic gene repeated more than 300 times in the
genome. This pre-rRNA must be post-transcriptionally processed to remove external and internal spacers to
release mature rRNAs. The majority of these assembly events occur in a specialized nuclear body called the
nucleolus. Owing, in part, to their complex assembly process, it is now appreciated that not all ribosomes are
the same, and it has been suggested that heterogenous ribosomes may have specialized functions. We have
discovered that an undetermined stress response pathway regulates early events in rRNA processing. We have
shown that this pathway is activated by oxidative stress, select viral infections, and chemotherapeutic drugs.
Activation results in unprocessed pre-rRNA being stored in the nucleolus, which re-enters the maturation process
when stress resolves. We are undertaking a multi-omics approach to uncover this pathway and determine how
this prolonged stalling of processing and storage of pre-rRNA in the nucleolus affects the assembly and activity
of ribosomes generated in this time window. We have developed a novel technique that allows for the time-
resolved capture of ribosomes to address this question. Further, analysis of processing sites demonstrates
profound sequence heterogeneity across the different repeated genes through the genome, raising the possibility
that processing events are differentially regulated between rRNA genes. We expect to clarify the sequence motifs
required for early rRNA processing and determine how naturally occurring variants contribute to the differential
expression of sub-types of ribosomes. We seek to understand better the basic principles governing ribosome
biogenesis in light of diverse sequence variation and how various stimuli alter the process of ribosome assembly."
10902576,"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is the second most common primary liver malignancy in the United
States and worldwide. iCCA has a dismal prognosis, with just a 20% 5-year survival rate, and the incidence of
this condition has been increasing over the last few decades. Many factors contribute to the poor prognosis of
iCCA, including issues with current diagnostic capabilities and limited treatment options. There has been
significant progress in the last decade in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying iCCA, including
identifying isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gain of function as one of the most common mutations specific to
iCCA, with R132 being the most common. This mutation results in alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG) being metabolized
to 2-Hydroxyglutarate (2HG), an oncometabolite and a surrogate marker of the mutation. This mutation provides
the potential for the development of precision medicine strategies for IDH mutant iCCA. Many new therapeutics
for IDH mutant iCCA using small molecule inhibitors of mutant IDH have been developed, with the ClarIDHy trial
showing promising phase III results. However, despite these advances, accurate diagnosis of iCCA, particularly
diagnosing subtypes, remains challenging, slowing the implementation of appropriate treatment strategies.
Current noninvasive diagnostic approaches for iCCA, such as Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS), Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (CE-MRI), and Computed Tomography (CT), have varied reports of sensitivity18–20.
Importantly, these techniques lack high specificity in the 30% of patients who present with cirrhosis, risking a
misdiagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Furthermore, these imaging techniques cannot determine the
specific subtype of iCCA without invasive procedures. Biopsies, the gold standard for confirming iCCA diagnosis,
have a long turnaround time and may be unsuitable for molecular analysis in up to 20% of cases. Due to these
limitations, there is a clinical need for minimally invasive and fast imaging tools capable of detecting iCCA
with IDH mutation and differentiating iCCA from HCC.
To address this need, we propose the use of hyperpolarized MRI as a novel diagnostic approach for identifying
mIDH-producing iCCA. By leveraging the enhanced sensitivity and spectral characteristics of hyperpolarized
carbon-13 (13C) labeled α-KG and its metabolites, we aim to study the dynamics of mIDH's enzymatic behavior
in vitro and in vivo. We will optimize the imaging parameters for this technique and build towards accurate
noninvasive identification of IDH-mutant iCCA.
Aim 1: Optimize an existing pulse sequence to maximize sensitivity to 2HG through spectral editing.
Aim 2: Characterize the dynamics and sensitivity of hyperpolarized 1-13C diethyl Alpha-ketoglutarate
metabolism in mIDH intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) cells.
Aim 3: Noninvasively identify IDH-mutated Cholangiocarcinoma using Hyperpolarized diethyl 1-13C
Alpha-ketoglutarate in patient-derived-xenograft mouse models."
10902637,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The use of specific pathogen free (SPF) mice has been instrumental in the advancement of immunological
research, reducing variability between experiments and institutions. However, it is becoming increasingly
evident that pathogen experience alters the immune system dramatically. This limits the translation potential of
discoveries in SPF mice, as humans are regularly exposed to pathogens from birth. Work from the Hamilton
lab and others has found that increasing the microbial exposure of mice through pet shop mouse cohousing
(COH) alters the immune compartment of mice to more accurately reflect that of an adult human. This change
is particularly evident in the memory CD8 T cell compartment. The CD8 T cell memory pool contains cells with
a wide range of trafficking patterns, effector functions, and longevity. In SPF mice, the CD8 T cell compartment
is dominated by naïve cells and central memory T cells. However, COH mice and adult humans contain
predominantly effector memory T cells, including long-lived effector cells (LLEC), a population described by the
Hamilton Lab. This proposal aims to understand how pathogen exposure and inflammation lead to the
expansion and maintenance of LLEC, and how the expansion of this cell population alters the overall function
of the T cell compartment. Aim 1 will determine what proinflammatory cytokines support LLEC formation and
persistence. Experiments will identify cytokines and other factors that lead to the increase in LLEC during
COH, via the use of RNA sequencing and CRISPR mediated genetic knockouts. We will also determine if we
can expand LLEC in the absence of pathogen exposure via administration of cytokines. Aim 2 will determine
how COH alters the function of LLEC, and address the consequences of skewing the memory compartment to
LLEC for responses to systemic and local infections. This aim will utilize adoptive cell transfers and an
inducible fluorescent reporter to determine if COH LLEC can protect against systemic and local infections.
Focusing on CD8 T cell memory, and incorporating RNA sequencing analysis, will support goals 1 and 2 of my
training plan, and the proposal will develop my skills as an academic scientist as a whole (training aim 3). The
Center for Immunology at the University of Minnesota is an ideal environment to complete this proposal as
there is a strong record of impactful immunological research and postdoctoral training, particularly within T cell
biology. Altogether, these studies will yield critical information regarding the importance of pathogen exposure
and inflammation on the memory T cell compartment, as well as novel information on the functionality of
subsets of memory CD8 T cells. These data will be useful to develop vaccines and T cell therapies with
increased translation potential."

Ewing sarcoma (ES) is the second most prevalent bone cancer among children. Aggressive in nature, ES is
driven by a fusion transcription factor of which EWS/FLI1 accounts for ~85% of cases. Drugging EWS/FLI1 is
difficult, as it is highly disordered. New ES therapies that modulate novel therapeutic targets are urgently needed.
Recently, the Stegmaier Lab collaboratively used CRISPR-Cas9 to develop a Pediatric Cancer Dependency
Map, which is integrated into the Broad Institute’s larger Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap). More than 18,000
genes were knocked out in >100 pediatric cell lines and the abundance of each guide RNA was monitored after
21 days. Data has been standardized across all cell lines so gene dependencies (i.e., genes that cancer lineages
depend on for growth) can be found. Mining this data, I identified IGF2BP1 as a potential ES dependency.
IGF2BP1 is an oncofetal RNA binding protein (RBP) that protects mRNA transcripts from degradation. My
preliminary data confirms ES cells have decreased proliferation in the context of IGF2BP1 knockout (KO).
In Aim 1, I will use CRISPR-Cas9 to KO IGF2BP1 in a panel of ES cell lines and PDX models to validate IGF2BP1
as a novel ES dependency. Since targeted degradation offers superior temporal control to genetic KO, I will also
use the dTAG system to determine how induced degradation of IGF2BP1 impacts ES biology. Next, in Aim 2, I
will determine the molecular mechanism underlying the IGF2BP1 dependency. EWS/FLI1 and Lin28B, another
oncofetal RBP, are the top two gene dependencies positively correlated with IGF2BP1 in DepMap. Therefore, I
will determine how IGF2BP1 KO affects these proteins and their mRNA. I will also use an unbiased, integrated
omics approach to identify other mRNAs that interact with IGF2BP1 in ES. Finally, in Aim 3, I will biochemically
characterize the IGF2BP1 dependency, determining which domains are necessary to support ES cell growth
and how IGF2BP1 recognizes ES relevant substrates. Together, this project will validate IGF2BP1 as a novel
therapeutic target in ES and uncover new mechanisms of ES maintenance, and the IGF2BP1-substrate
interactions characterized could be leveraged to identify novel IGF2BP1 inhibitors.
I will gain skills in CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, functional genomics, as well as in vivo experimentation, and I
will become a pediatric solid tumor expert upon completion of my fellowship training plan. Dana-Farber (DFCI)
is a globally renowned cancer institute and the perfect place for my training because DFCI and its affiliates have
many experimental and academic resources like the Broad Institute’s computational bootcamp. My postdoctoral
training, along with my chemical biology expertise from graduate school, will put me in a perfect position to start
my independent research career focused on developing new chemical tools to study pediatric cancers."
10903105,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is a chronic, relapsing disease that, despite our best efforts to understand and
mitigate the disease, has become a worsening public health crisis. 1,2 Currently, the medications to treat OUD
interact directly with opioid receptors. 3 While this helps patients decrease the use of more dangerous opioids,
the mechanism of action of the currently available drugs continues to perpetuate the substance abuse cycle.
Exploring novel non-opioid targets is necessary to overcome this current standstill. One specific alternative
population we are interested in investigating is calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) expressing neurons
within the parabrachial nucleus (CGRPPBN). These neurons have been well studied in itch and pain fields and
are known to project to the central amygdala (CeA) 4,5, a brain region directly implicated in processing the
negative emotional valence associated with alcohol and opioid withdrawal. The objective of this proposal is to
assess the functional role of CGRPPBN in opioid reinforcement and to determine the gene expression and
epigenetic changes associated with opioid taking and opioid withdrawal. Our preliminary results show that
CGRPPBN activity decreases during opioid taking and increases during opioid withdrawal. We have also found
that this population of neurons robustly expresses the µ-opioid receptor along with glutamatergic markers,
positioning this population as a potential direct activator of the CeA during opioid withdrawal. To further probe
these results, I will inhibit CGRPPBN neurons using molecular and pharmacological approaches and determine
the behavioral consequences of these interventions. One of the pharmacological approaches we will be testing
is an FDA-approved CGRP inhibitor currently used for migraine treatment. We will then establish the molecular
profile of these neurons using nuclear RNAseq and Cleavage Under Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) at baseline, as
well as during morphine taking and protracted abstinence. By integrating transcriptomic data with epigenetic
information on post-translational histone modifications, I will be able to build a comprehensive map of the active
and inactive chromatin regions with their corresponding differentially expressed genes, which can be used to
detect epigenetic targets critical to the identity of CGRPPBN neurons. The results of this study will allow us to
establish the feasibility of targeting these neurons to treat OUD via currently FDA-approved medications or
through novel epigenetic targets identified in this study. These results will broaden our understanding of
withdrawal and help expand our therapeutic arsenal for the long-term maintenance of opioid abstinence and
prevention of relapse."
10906343,"SHARED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: ABSTRACT
Shared resources play a critical role in enhancing and supporting the scientific, outreach, and educational
endeavors of The University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC) and its 171 members. A proposed shared
resource is given consideration for official KUCC Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) shared resource status
based on the number of members served as well as the depth and breadth of science enhanced. KUCC
continually assesses its shared resources to ensure they have distinct services to avoid overlap of support,
have a solid user base of KUCC membership utilizing the resource, are cost-effective, have systems to track
utilization, are accessible to all members across our four campuses, and have charge-back rates that have
been approved by institutional finance and meet the NIH guidelines. All shared resources adhere to the
following prioritization for providing support: 1) KUCC members with NCI grants or applying for NCI grants and
KUCC pilots; 2) KUCC members with cancer or cancer-related grants funded by other NIH institutes or other
peer-reviewed grants as defined by the NCI or applying for such grants; 3) KUCC-sponsored non peer-
reviewed projects; 4) Other grants or contracts that are not peer-reviewed (e.g., philanthropy or industry
funded); and 5) Unfunded projects. These priorities place the highest emphasis on peer-reviewed funded
research projects as a means of assuring that support is provided to high-quality research. Continual feedback
has been ascertained using surveys, focus groups, individual member input, external experts, and assessment
and guidance by KUCC leadership. The annual shared resource survey in 2020 showed 94-100% satisfaction
for all shared resources. A key focus during the previous grant cycle has been to enhance shared resource
access across all four campuses as well as stimulating more use across membership and the utilization of
multiple shared resources. Member usage spans all research programs and campuses and has grown
considerably from 99 in 2010, to 113 in 2015 and now 137 in 2020. KUCC also tracks super users, members
who utilize three or more shared resources within a year. The number of super users has grown from nine in
2010, to 23 in 2015, to now 52 in 2020. Since our initial application, usage has increased across all three
programs: Cancer Biology has gone from 41% of members utilizing shared resources to now 78% of members
utilizing shared resources; Cancer Prevention and Control has gone from 69% of members utilizing shared
resources to now 78% of members utilizing shared resources; and Drug Discovery, Development and
Experimental Therapeutics has gone from 54% of members utilizing shared resources to now 84% utilizing
shared resources. In 2019, KUCC undertook a strategic planning effort to identify enhancements for shared
resources to meet the ever-changing needs of members over the next five years. These enhancements totaled
over $5M in requests and initial investments have already begun with an expected outlay of additional support
of over $1M in 2021."
10904209,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tauopathies are a set of degenerative diseases that includes Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related
dementias. Several passive anti-tau immunotherapies are under development and/or in clinical trials. While hope
is high for therapeutic benefits, there is concern that they are not the right targets (e.g. bind total tau) and/or are
not delivered to the right place (i.e. not intraneuronal), which may significantly limit therapeutic benefit.
Alternatively, gene therapy delivery of antibody single chain fragment variables (scFvs), represents a more
robust approach to deliver pathological tau conformation-specific antibodies (right targets) within neurons
affected by tauopathy (right place). We developed a tau antibody that specifically recognize pathogenic tau
conformations directly connected to mechanisms of axonal and synaptic toxicity in neurons, called Tau N-
Terminal 2 (TNT2). This antibody binds tau when it undergoes modifications that cause conformation-dependent
display of an N-terminal motif called the phosphatase-activating domain (PAD). PAD exposure is an early
pathogenic change in human AD and other tauopathies linked with pathogenic modifications (e.g. oligomers or
phospho-tau) and toxicity. Thus, adapting TNT2 as a therapeutic agent has a potentially high impact. We will
use recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to deliver the TNT2-scFv coupled to HaloTag protein and a
protein degradation signal (PDS) peptide to facilitate proteasomal breakdown of PAD exposed tau species.
Recent AAV advances, such as AAV CAP-B10 capsid, provide a novel non-invasive route to systemically deliver
AAVs that produce widespread CNS transduction further enhancing potential translatability of this approach. We
hypothesize that TNT2-scFv-Halo-PDS will effectively engage and degrade PAD exposed tau (Aim 1A) and
systemic delivery of AAV-TNT2-scFv-Halo-PDS will effectively deliver the scFv intraneuronally in the CNS and
subsequently rescue the phenotype of the PS19 mouse model of tauopathy (Aim 1B). In Aim 1A, we will develop
and validate the novel TNT2-scFv-Halo-PDS by testing heavy chain/light chain and light chain/heavy chain
configurations of the scFv and target engagement will be measured using a series of in-cell protein-protein
interaction assays in a HEK cell tauopathy model. In Aim 1B, we will deliver AAV-TNT2-scFv-Halo-PDS using
the AAV-CAP-B10 viral vector to allow non-invasive systemic delivery and widespread CNS expression in PS19
mice. First, we will test expression in the CNS and peripheral organs using wild-type mice. Then, we will perform
a disease prevention study (early AAV delivery) and a disease modifying study (mid-disease AAV delivery) in
PS19 mice. We will measure behavior/cognitive performance, scFv expression, target engagement, tau
neuropathology, neurodegeneration markers (neurons, synapses, etc.) and neuroinflammation markers.
Successful completion of this project will conclusively determine whether, or not, a highly novel immuno-gene
therapy for tauopathy (AAV-TNT2-scFv-Halo-PDS) holds promise as a potential therapy against tauopathy."

3D nuclear space to direct cell type specific gene expression. Currently, a major barrier to
understanding the transcriptional regulatory programs is the lack of tools, models and maps
to explore the chromatin architecture in diverse cell types and physiological contexts. We
will address this pressing need by deploying transformative technologies to study the
chromatin architecture in mammalian cells at an unprecedented resolution and scale.
Specifically, we will generate navigable, cell-type-specific reference maps of chromatin
architecture in the mouse, macaque and human brains by integrating high resolution and
high throughput imaging and orthogonal single-cell-based genomic methods. We will also
dissect the role of chromatin architecture in gene regulation through a set of controlled
perturbation experiments in the mouse ES cells (ESC) and ESC-derived neural progenitor
cells (NPC). We will develop structural models of chromatin organization with advanced
polymer physics and statistical learning methods, and validate their predictive power in
embryonic stem cells and in ex vivo brain slices. Finally, we will make the reference maps,
analytical tools, visualization methods and structural models available to the broader
community. The proposed research project will dramatically transform our ability to analyze
the 4D Nucleome of complex tissues, and produce the much-needed maps, tools and
models for understanding the gene regulatory programs encoded in the linear genome

10903042,"Due to the broad etiological heterogeneity of autistic phenotypes, unitary theories of autism often fall short of
describing the entirety, or even the majority, of the autism spectrum. Recent predictive coding hypotheses
avoid this core issue by arguing autism is caused by altered parameters for updating mental models of the
world, while leaving the details of those changes open. Attempts at building falsifiable predictive coding
theories by specifying these details, such as the slow-updating and high-precision hypotheses of predictive
coding in autism, have led to conflicting empirical results, implying they encounter the same dilemma as other
unitary theories. Different prediction strategies may appear in different subsets of the heterogenous autistic
population or be more relevant in specific tasks or contexts. In addition, there may be dissociations between
prediction strategies and behavior in autism that lead to behavioral differences between autism and typical
development without an altered underlying predictive mechanism. This project aims to assess multiple theories
of predictive coding in a task-driven, non-social context and a task-free, social context. We use multiple
measurement paradigms, including phenotypic characterization, eye-tracking, and functional neuroimaging, to
obtain as complete a picture as possible of the entire cognitive mechanism, spanning multiple constructs
across several domains of human functioning. This evidence will allow us to disentangle both individual-level
heterogeneity in coding impairments from task- or context-level heterogeneity and dissociation between
behavioral outcomes and neural correlates of predictive coding. Our work will contribute to our understanding
of both the ""how"" and the ""why"" of temporal prediction by measuring how typical and atypical temporal
prediction are encoded in the brain and variation in the links between temporal prediction and social behaviors
across social behavioral phenotypes. Focusing on autism, which is typified by impairments in social function,
allows us to determine how much temporal prediction is a direct factor in the ease with which individuals attain
their desired social connectedness, or whether it is largely mediated through other cognitive constraints. More
generally, this project will provide insight on what temporal prediction is for. In clinical knowledge and practice,
this research will lead to improvements in our ability to precisely target interventions, particularly those
involving structured sensory experiences, to specific patients by building on existing predictive coding
capabilities to scaffold the development of social behaviors. It will also lead to assessments of these
interventions' effects on cognitive mechanisms, rather than relying purely on behavioral or phenotypic
outcomes. This will allow clinicians to more effectively capitalize on autistic individuals' existing skills to achieve
their own social and relational goals. Such work is crucial now given rising incidence and diagnosis rates of
autism and related neurodevelopmental disorders, an increasingly chaotic sensory environment, and the
ongoing search for more effective and efficient interventions and assessments for autism."

Toxoplasma gondii is a common protozoan parasite that forms a lifelong infection in the brain. Despite
chronic infection, Toxoplasma only causes clinical pathology in the immune compromised and therefore
triggers an effective and well-balanced immune response in the brain. T. gondii replication and innate
immunity are strongly regulated by CNS resident astrocytes. Astrocytes ordinarily execute vital processes
for proper brain function and reprogram into reactive astrocytes (RAs) during brain inflammation. The
beneficial or detrimental roles of RAs in brain inflammation and neurotoxicity has remained debated and
largely unknown. During Toxoplasma infection, astrocytes limit parasite proliferation in a STAT1-depend-
ent manner, produce multiple cytokines and chemokines to attract immune cells to the brain, and modify
extracellular concentrations of neurotransmitters to regulate the inflammatory environment of the tissue
Like many immune cells, astrocytes are increasingly recognized as falling into distinct functional subsets
but unlike immune cells our ability to manipulate RAs or study their function in a disease- or infection-
specific manner has been limited. Here we propose to characterize, track and selectively manipulate RAs
to determine their diversity and functional roles in the immune response during chronic Toxoplasma in-
fection. We have generated a novel tamoxifen-inducible Cre knock-in mouse line driven by the lipocalin
2 (Lcn2) promoter (Lcn2CreERT2). By crossing to the Ai9 TdTomato reporter line, we have visualized RAs
in various pathological states including systemic inflammation and T. gondii infection. Traditional astro-
cyte promoters will be used in combination with Lcn2CreERT2 to selectively target RAs for genetic manipu-
lation at any point during progression of infection, while leaving healthy astrocytes, neurons, and other
glial cell types intact, transforming our understanding of astrocyte function and underlying inflammatory
mechanisms during Toxoplasma infection. Three aims are proposed: In Aim1 infection-induced astrocyte
subsets will be identified and characterized over the course of infection using flow cytometry and
scRNAseq analysis. In Aim2 we will track the resolution of RAs in the context of high and low inflammatory
environments following infection and in Aim3 we will manipulate RA gene expression to determine the
beneficial and detrimental roles of RAs during chronic Toxoplasma infection. The rationale for the pro-
posed research is that determining the development, function and responsiveness of astrocyte subsets
during chronic infection will provide new knowledge on the long-term consequences of Toxoplasma in-
fection and the basis of a working inflammatory response in the brain."

 Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disability yet extremely
underserved by systems of care. FASD is linked to varying abilities in areas of executive function, attention, memory,
adaptive skills, and emotion regulation. These emotion regulation difficulties are associated with 90% of individuals with
FASD having co-occurring mental health disorders. However, no evidence-based mental health treatments have been
adapted or tested for this population. This gap is particularly salient for the adolescent period, as many of these co-
occurring disorders arise during this developmental timeframe.
 Dialectical behavior therapy for adolescents (DBT-A) is an evidence-based cognitive-behavioral therapy that
specifically targets the biological predisposition for emotion dysregulation and invalidating environments that adolescents
with FASD commonly experience. DBT-A is an intensive treatment program, involving weekly skills groups with
adolescents and their caregivers, weekly individual therapy for adolescents, and 24/7 phone coaching. The proposed
project aims to adapt DBT-A for adolescents with FASD and their caregivers and test the feasibility of the adaptations in a
community mental health clinic. Given low FASD awareness among community clinicians, this project will also involve
the development of trainings for mental health clinicians on FASD. Implementation science, specifically the EPIS
framework (Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment) and attention to social determinants of health will
guide the conduct of the project. Input from a community advisory board consisting of adolescents with FASD, caregivers,
and mental health clinicians will be prioritized at every step of the EPIS process.
 The aims of the proposed project are as follows: Aim 1- Systematically develop materials for FASD-informed
DBT-A administration utilizing the EPIS implementation framework; Aim 2 - Conduct a feasibility trial of DBT-A with
adolescents with FASD and their primary caregiver. The proposed project is an essential foundational step to address the
gap in mental health care for individuals with FASD, as well as assist mental health clinicians in best serving this
population. The feasibility of this project is supported by emerging research adapting DBT to other populations with
neurodevelopmental difficulties. As this project will take place in an existing clinic in the community, it allows for careful
examination of implementation factors that could support future generalizability to other existing mental health clinics.
Additionally, the proposed project will provide mentored training to prepare the PI for a career as an independent
researcher. Through the support and guidance of experts in the fields of FASD, intervention, implementation science,
DBT, and social determinants of health, the PI will gain essential competencies in mental health intervention
development, rigorous implementation and dissemination processes, and community-member engagement."

Infection with Plasmodium parasites leads to over 240 million cases of malaria and 700 thousand deaths
annually, the majority of which are children under the age of five. Vector control has reduced transmission of
Plasmodium, though a protective vaccine is required to reduce disease burden further. Currently deployed
vaccines focus on the liver stage circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and offer moderate protection in Plasmodium-
naïve individuals. However, vaccine efficacy and durability severely decline in individuals who have previously
been infected with Plasmodium. Understanding how Plasmodium infection influences the pre-vaccine CSP-
specific memory B cell pool is essential to identify why our current vaccinations are ineffective in endemic areas.
Previous research has demonstrated that antibody responses towards two domains of CSP, the
immunodominant repeat region (RR) and the non-dominant C terminus (CT), may be protective against infection.
In contrast, other data suggest that the highly repetitive sequence of the RR may instead be a mechanism of
immune evasion. The high avidity of this region may drive short-lived humoral responses or concentrate
responses to the RR rather than perhaps more functional regions of CSP. We generated unique tetramers that
allow us to isolate and track RR and CT-specific B cell responses during infection and/or immunization. In a
murine model, we found that Plasmodium infection preferentially expands B cells specific to the RR at the
expense of CT-specific B cells. In contrast, vaccination alone expands B cell populations specific to both
domains. We hypothesize that Plasmodium infection induces a predominantly RR-specific pre-vaccine memory
B cell pool that, due the high avidity of the region, will differentiate into short-lived plasmablasts upon a
subsequent vaccination rather than reseeding memory pools. In this proposal, we will characterize the CSP-
specific memory B cell pool generated during infection or immunization in a murine model and relevant human
clinical trial samples. We will also identify the impact of previous infection on the response to a subsequent
vaccination. Lastly, we will use novel, modified vaccination strategies to improve vaccine efficacy and durability
in previously infected models. Understanding how to induce a larger breadth of B cell responses or induce longer
lived RR-specific cells is important to improve vaccine efficacy in individuals previously infected with
Plasmodium."

Diabetes markedly increases risk of development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Human and
animal data also show that diabetes prevents the normal repair of damaged arteries that occurs upon circulating
LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction. Because of this, patients with diabetes still have greater risk of a
cardiovascular event even after statin reduction of LDL-C than individuals without diabetes. Individuals with
diabetes have greater platelet aggregation, altered white blood cells, and more vascular inflammation,
pathological processes that are improved by LDL-C reduction in unaffected individuals. We hypothesize that by
determining response to LDL-C reduction in T1D, we will identify pathways that can be therapeutically targeted
to optimize vascular repair and prevent CVD events. These data can also be used to determine patient
characteristics that associate with defective response to LDL-C reduction. We propose a clinical study of
response to LDL-C reduction in patients with Type 1 diabetes (T1D). We will recruit the patients from two major
medical centers, NYU Langone and Mount Sinai that serve diverse communities within New York City. Subjects
will be treated for 4 weeks with robust cholesterol-reducing therapies, PCSK9 inhibitors and also either statin
(80 mg atorvastatin) or ezetimibe (10 mg). Each subject will serve as their own control and we will determine
changes in platelets and white blood cells along with circulating inflammatory factors that occur when LDL-C is
markedly reduced. In a subgroup of subjects, changes in vascular inflammation will be determined by
assessment of harvested brachial vein endothelial cells and by uptake of 18F-fluordeoxyglucose into arteries. The
data will be analyzed by an experienced statistician with expertise in diabetes and CVD risk and will identify the
relationship of these changes with HbA1c and glucose variability, and differences between women and men. In
addition, the data in T1D will be compared with similar data assessing response to LDL-C in subjects with Type
2 diabetes and controls to determine abnormalities that differ between these two forms of diabetes."
10899676,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The transition from opioid use to abuse and, eventually, to dependence may be governed by distinct genetic
mechanisms that alter the molecular pathways that mediate opioid use disorder (OUD). The identity of these
genetic/genomic mechanisms is unknown, in part, because the majority of OUD studies have been done in
substance-dependent individuals where the dissociation between susceptibility and consequence is ambiguous
and genetic/environmental factors are equivocal. One potential strategy for investigating the genetic mechanisms
underlying differences in opiate-use trajectories that we have been pursuing in rats is to examine the
neurobiology of complex behavioral phenotypes that are associated with different phases of drug use. Our work
has identified a decision-making phenotype (e.g., ¨+ parameter) that predicts opiate-taking behaviors in rats,
which differs from the decision-making phenotype that is affected by opiate use (e.g., ¨0 parameter). We have
found that these distinct phenotypes are controlled by different orbitofrontal circuits that involve the amygdala
and nucleus accumbens, and our preliminary proteomic data indicates that these phenotypes are mediated by
divergent signaling pathways. We posit, therefore, that these computationally-derived phenotypes could serve
as a powerful tool for dissociating the genomic/genetic mechanisms of opioid use susceptibility from those that
are consequential to drug use. Here, we propose to use state-of-the-art genomic approaches to identify genes
that mediate susceptibility to opiate-taking behaviors and those that mediate drug-induced behavioral changes.
In Aim 1, we will investigate the genomic mechanisms underlying susceptibility to oxycodone use. Decision
making will be assessed in rats (N=300) to identify individuals who either have low or high ¨+ parameter
(N=60/group) that predicts susceptibility to opiate-taking behaviors. RNA sequencing will be performed on tissue
from the orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and amygdala to identify genes whose expression differs
between rats with a low or high ¨+ parameter. We will then perform ATAC sequencing to identify the open
chromatin regions associated with the genes that differ between rats with a low or high ¨+ parameter. In Aim 2,
we will investigate the genomic mechanisms underlying the decision-making consequences of oxycodone self-
administration. Decision making will be assessed in rats (N=300) before and after they self-administer oxycodone
to identify individuals who either have low or high ¨0 parameter (N=60/group) following drug exposure. Tissue
collected from the orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and amygdala will be sequenced using next-
generation RNA sequence to identify genes whose expression differs between rats with a low or high ¨0
parameter. We will then perform ATAC sequencing to identify the open chromatin regions associated with the
differentially expressed genes. Our results – integrating genomic approaches with human-based computational
phenotypes in rats – will provide critical insights into the genomic mechanisms associated with distinct stages
along the OUD trajectory and develop a translational platform for future studies of OUD in humans."

High-quality low back pain (LBP) care should include nonpharmacological interventions as the primary
management strategy and serial pain assessment using validated patient reported outcome measures
(PROMs). PROMs are standardized, validated questionnaires completed by patients to identify and quantify
their perceptions of their health status. In addition to serving as a marker of high-quality LBP care, PROM use
may impact pain-related clinical practice by facilitating shared decision making and communication between
patients and healthcare professionals, enabling progress assessment to evaluate treatment plan
appropriateness, and possibly positively influencing health status (including pain level and pain-related ability).
However, little is known about the extent of translation of the recommended use of PROMs in usual practice by
chiropractors. The goal of the research in this proposal is to describe the use of validated PROMs in LBP
management in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) chiropractic clinics and perform feasibility pilot testing of
a point-of-care CDS alert to facilitate use in the documentation workflow. An adaptation of the Technology
Acceptance Model will be used as the theoretical basis for increasing use of PROMs by chiropractors through
a technology-based intervention. In Aim 1, we will quantify the current national documentation of validated
PROMs during LBP care by VHA chiropractors using natural language processing on electronic health record
data. In Aim 2, we will survey VHA chiropractors to understand priorities and considerations in the
documentation and clinical workflow for PROM use and clinical decision support. This “community-based”
approach to stakeholder engagement will assess the acceptance, usability, and appropriateness of electronic
health record based clinical decision support alert as an intervention to promote PROM use. In Aim 3, we will
conduct a single-arm feasibility and acceptability pilot of the developed CDS alert in four VHA chiropractic
clinics, measuring preliminary intervention adoption, feasibility, and acceptability as outcomes. The proposed
research will evaluate the feasibility and refine methods in support of a full-scale pragmatic trial to assess the
effects of a CDS alert intervention on high-quality LBP care delivery, including clinician use of PROMs as a
quality marker, and on patient outcomes in chiropractic clinics and other care settings commonly managing
LBP. As a career development award proposal, this project will prepare Dr. Coleman for a career as an
independent scientist and inform future trials studying the use of point-of-care decision support tools to guide
LBP management. He has assembled a team of mentors and collaborators with diverse expertise in medical
informatics, clinical research, chiropractic care, and intervention development to guide his transition to an
independent investigator. During this mentored award, he will acquire and enhance his knowledge and skills in
clinical research, including pragmatic clinical trials and implementation science."

10899530,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Enhancers play critical roles in determining lineage-specific gene expression and cellular identities, and are
enriched in noncoding disease mutations and risk loci. There is an urgent need to elucidate the complete
mechanisms of enhancer functions and malfunctions to better understand disease etiology and to develop new,
enhancer-targeting therapies. The recent finding that active enhancers often generate noncoding enhancer
RNAs (eRNAs) has provided a new perspective to interpret enhancer activity in the context of RNA-mediated
regulation. This proposal aims to establish a unique research direction by developing new approaches to
address the molecular mechanisms underlying eRNA functions in gene/genome regulation. Our overall
hypothesis is that eRNAs assemble specific ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) to organize high-order
enhancer structures in the three-dimensional nucleus to control gene transcription. We have three specific
aims in this proposal. We plan to use a robust RNA capture method that we have developed to systematically
identify eRNA:protein interactomes in human cells. For the first aim, we plan to focus on two novel eRNA-
binding proteins (eRBPs) to characterize their functions in gene transcription and 3D genome interaction in
mammalian cells. Subsequently, we have two aims to study the mechanisms of each of the two eRBPs to fully
characterize the biochemical basis permitting eRNA:protein interaction and their possible involvement in
mediating the formation of transcriptionally-associated sub-nuclear condensates. The expected results from
this proposal will provide novel mechanistic insights into gene transcriptional regulation and RNA functions in
mammalian cells. As enhancers become important drivers in disease development, these mechanistic insights
may offer new therapeutic strategies to treat enhancer-driven diseases."
10899531,"ABSTRACT – Single-molecule protein identification and single-cell proteomics
Recent advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing has broadly transformed biological research and
biomedicine, and led to single-cell sequencing and precision medicine. Compared to nucleic acids, proteins more
directly reflect cellular states and dynamic changes, and are recognised as more effective biomarkers. Current
mass spectrometry-based proteomics suffers from limited detection sensitivity (requiring 105-6 peptide molecules),
and does not allow effective detection of low-abundance cellular proteins and biomarkers in small samples (e.g.
single cells or liquid biopsy samples). Given that a PCR-like self-replication strategy for protein amplification is
not within sight, there is an urgent need to develop an amplification-free (i.e. single-molecule) approach for
accurate, unbiased protein identification and high-throughput profiling.
The goal of this proposal is to develop a new technology that is capable of accurate, high-throughput protein
identification from unknown samples at the single-molecule level. The premise of this research is that super-
resolution microscopy can sensitively extract amino acid signatures (their abundances, or linear distribution
along the protein’s primary sequence) from single, intact protein molecules, which provide accurate identification
and high throughput for protein profiling. This technology will combine high-sensitivity, high-resolution DNA-
PAINT imaging, high-efficiency protein labelling, protein backbone extension, and microfluidic control for single-
cell manipulation. Specifically, I will develop two aims: (1) Develop the biochemistry, microscopy, biophysics,
and computational methods for enabling high-throughput, single-molecule protein identification using specific
amino acid signatures, (2) Develop a microfluidic workflow comprising single-cell lysis, protein capture and
modification, and single-molecule imaging for enabling single-cell proteomics. Successful completion of the
proposed research will lead to high-throughput, in-depth proteomic studies in a wide range of basic research and
clinical contexts, including single-cell proteomics (for mammalian and bacterial samples), discovery of low-
abundance biomarkers, and identification of new pathogens. Furthermore, novel concepts and methods
developed during this research (e.g. high-efficiency protein-DNA labelling, protein backbone extension) will form
the basis of future biophysical studies and biotechnological developments.
This K99/R00 award will facilitate my long-term goal to lead an independent academic research program and
develop intelligent molecular tools for advancing biological research and treatment of diseases. The training
provided during the K99 period, under the guidance of my excellent mentors, will allow me to further extend my
scientific knowledge and technical expertise, as well as to develop my professional skills to facilitate transition
towards an independent scientist and team manager."

(PrEP) use during pregnancy is both safe and effective in preventing HIV. However, posttraumatic stress
(associated with intimate partner violence and/or other traumas) and depression negatively impact PrEP
adherence among women in SA. Addressing posttraumatic stress and depression will likely improve PrEP
adherence and persistence (i.e., sustained PrEP adherence over time) during pregnancy and breastfeeding,
which are periods of dramatically increased HIV risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop and test
the feasibility and acceptability of a cognitive behavioral intervention that targets common underlying factors of
posttraumatic stress and depression to improve PrEP adherence and persistence during pregnancy and the
postpartum transition. Candidate: I am a clinical psychologist and a postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts
General Hospital/Harvard Medical School. I am applying for a five-year K23 Career Development Award to obtain
the training, mentorship, and research experience that will enable me to become (1) an independent investigator
at the R01 level and (2) an expert in reducing the psychological barriers to HIV prevention among women in low-
resource settings. Mentoring: Dr. Conall O’Cleirigh will serve as my primary mentor; he brings expertise in the
psychosocial aspects of HIV prevention and intervention development for global contexts. Drs. Christina Psaros
and Jessica Haberer, both co-mentors, will offer guidance on qualitative data analysis as it applies to intervention
development and implementation science frameworks for low- and middle-income settings. Drs. Landon Myer,
John Joska, and Lucia Knight, my SA-based co-mentors, will provide mentorship on biomedical HIV prevention
strategies for use during pregnancy/postpartum, intervention development for the South African context, and
intervention sustainability within the antenatal clinic setting. Dr. Robert Parker, a biostatistician, will serve as a
consultant. Training: Specific training in qualitative analysis for intervention development and implementation,
HIV prevention during pregnancy, and psychosocial treatment development for resource-limited settings will be
achieved through intensive direct mentorship, coursework, workshops, and primary research in SA. This training
and research experience will enable me to support the mental and sexual health of women at risk for acquiring
HIV. Research: The specific aims of the project are to (1) explore the mechanisms by which posttraumatic stress
and depression impact PrEP adherence and persistence during pregnancy via qualitative interviews; (2) develop
and conduct a proof-of-concept test of a brief PrEP adherence and persistence intervention that reduces the
negative impact of psychological mechanisms common to posttraumatic stress and depression on PrEP use,
and builds behavioral skills to improve self-care; and (3) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the
intervention, which will be integrated into antenatal care, in a pilot randomized controlled trial. We will use this
formative research to apply for an R01-level grant to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of the intervention."

Healthy bone is critical for long term health not only to minimize fracture risk, but as an active endocrine organ
with influence on energy homeostasis, mineral metabolism, and body composition. Significant public health
consequences of poor bone health include increased risk of fracture-related morbidity and mortality, insulin
resistance, and cardiovascular disease. However, the potential for ubiquitous endocrine-disrupting chemicals
to affect bone health is unknown. Phthalates, chemicals used in plastics and personal care products, have
been associated with biological pathways that may affect bone health, including disruption of hormones
essential to bone homeostasis and activation of PPARg, directing differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells
from osteoblasts to adipocytes. Recently, urinary phthalate metabolites were cross-sectionally associated with
lower bone mineral density (BMD) and higher osteoporosis risk in post-menopausal women in NHANES, but
the effects of exposure at different life stages or on bone metabolic function have not been explored. Some
heavy metals have also been associated with decreased BMD and increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture.
For example, lead accumulates in the bone matrix, compromising bone integrity. Pregnancy and
perimenopause are life stages potentially sensitive to exposure related changes in bone health, as they are
characterized by intense bone remodeling and changes in metabolic and hormone homeostasis. Therefore,
our goal is to investigate relationships of phthalate and metals exposure across pregnancy and perimenopause
with measures of bone health in midlife. The proposed research leverages the Early Life Exposures in Mexico
to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) birth cohort, as participating mothers, who are now 40-65 years of
age, provided extensive demographic, anthropometric, and health information, and repeated phthalate and
metal exposure measures, during pregnancy. In this study, participants will provide information on phthalate
and metal exposure, bone structure, bone metabolism, and body composition at a perimenopausal follow-up
visit (n=400). BMI and menopausal status will be explored as potential effect modifiers, and phthalate
metabolites and metals will be considered individually and as mixtures. Our aims are to investigate 1)
associations of BMI during pregnancy and BMI trajectory through pregnancy and perinatal periods with BMD,
skeletal muscle index, and gynoid and android adipose tissue distribution assessed using dual energy x-ray
absorptiometry (iDXA), and bone microstructure assessed by quantitative ultrasound, in midlife; 2) associations
of phthalate and metals exposure during pregnancy and perimenopause with bone microstructure, BMD, and
muscle and adipose tissue distribution; 3) associations of phthalate and metals exposure during pregnancy
and perimenopause with biomarkers of bone metabolism in midlife. Findings from this work will provide insight

A chronic inflammatory state, termed inflammageing, is a major driver of morbidity and premature death among
older adults. Although the identification of inflammatory triggers has been identified as a critical area for aging
research, little attention has focused on the skin, despite its role as a primary immunoregulatory organ. Normal
aging is associated with increased skin barrier permeability, which leads to subclinical inflammatory cascades
in the skin and serum. We hypothesize that age-associated decline of skin barrier function contributes to
inflammageing and that restoring the skin barrier with moisturizers will reduce systemic inflammation.
We propose a pilot trial designed to determine the best measures of skin barrier function in older adults, the
most sensitive measures of systemic inflammation, the role of the cutaneous microbiome, and the feasibility
and acceptability of moisturizer use. In a parallel, 8-week, self-controlled design, 32 subjects ≥70 years of age
will be randomized to treatment with a ceramide moisturizing cream or petrolatum ointment. Changes in
inflammatory markers, skin barrier function, and microbial diversity will be compared between a 4-week
treatment period of moisturizer application and a 4-week placebo period. We will also examine recruitment
efficacy, retention rates, fidelity to the treatment, data integrity, and the acceptability of the intervention and
protocol. The results will be used to design a future randomized efficacy trial of moisturizers to reduce systemic
inflammation. While many other pharmacologic strategies for reducing inflammation in older adults are
considered too risky or expensive for widespread use, moisturizers are a promising intervention that is safe
and accessible in diverse community settings."

This project aims to address a significant knowledge gap regarding the mechanism by which VPS37A deficiency
provides a survival advantage for cancer cells, particularly in the context of accumulated intracellular Death-
Inducing Signaling Complexes (iDISC) and impaired autophagic flux. The VPS37A gene, located on 8p22, is
frequently lost in major solid cancers. Our recent findings have highlighted VPS37A as a crucial regulator of
phagophore closure, a pivotal step in the formation of double membrane autophagosomes during autophagy.
Notably, the depletion of VPS37A inhibits phagophore closure, leading to the upregulation of the NF-κB signaling
pathway. This upregulation is dependent on the LC3-conjugation machinery and the autophagy adaptor p62.
Moreover, the inhibition of NF-κB activation through the blockade of IKK or TAK1 induces iDISC-mediated
apoptosis in 8p/VPS37A-deleted cancer cells. Additionally, our analysis of the Cancer Dependency Map portal
revealed that TAK1, along with its cofactor TAB2, demonstrates a strong functional connection with VPS37A in
cancer cell survival. TAK1 and TAB2 are known to localize on autophagosomal membranes. Based on these
compelling observations, we propose that the TAK1/TAB2/NF-κB axis associated with the phagophore serves
as a gatekeeper, suppressing iDISC activation and promoting cancer cell survival. We are in an ideal position to
test this hypothesis in the following Specific Aims: 1) define the phagophore-associated regulators of the
TAK1/NF-κB pathway; 2) define the regulators of iDISC activation upon phagophore closure inhibition; 3) explore
the roles of phagophore-mediated TAK1/NF-kB signaling in tumor development and progression. Successful
implementation of this research will provide valuable insights into the interplay between the TAK1/NF-κB
signaling and iDISC/CASP8 cascade on phagophores to control cell death and survival and pave the way for
future development of new strategies to treat cancers, especially those with 8p/VPS37A deletion."

Interactions of stem cells with their surrounding microenvironment are known to be essential for both normal
development, and for sustaining self-renewing adult stem cells, such as the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).
Since cancers often hijack developmental signals for their progression, it is likely that niche-driven signals that
sustain HSCs also influence the growth of leukemias arising from mutations in HSCs and early hematopoietic
progenitors, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (bcCML). Despite
recent advances in treatment, ~75% of AML patients still succumb to the disease, highlighting the need to better
understand mechanisms of disease progression. While much work has focused on leukemia cell-intrinsic
regulators, the role of the microenvironment in disease establishment and propagation is poorly understood. Our
overall goal is to define the role of leukemia-niche interactions on myeloid leukemogenesis. In support of a
functional role of the niche in disease progression, our work has shown that adhesive interaction of AML with
endothelial cells is critical to maintain the therapy-resistant leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Since osteoprogenitors
expand in the leukemic bone marrow, it is possible that these osteoprogenitors also create a cancer-supporting
microenvironment. As an alternate to identifying niche-driven signals promoting leukemogenesis, we determined
cell surface antigens expressed on LSCs that can act as receptors for these signals using our recent in vivo
genome-wide CRISPR screen. The 140 cell surface genes identified by our screen included those known to
promote leukemia growth (e.g., Cd47, Cd157) and novel regulators of leukemia progression. To focus on signals
likely to be cancer-specific, we selected a subset of novel cell-surface regulators with 2-fold higher expression
in human bcCML LSCs compared to normal HSCs in our new RNA-seq dataset. Of these, the taurine transporter
SLC6A6 (TauT) is of particular interest since its high expression is associated with poor prognosis in AML
(TCGA). Using TauT-/- mice, we find that genetic loss of TauT significantly impairs leukemia growth in vivo as
compared to TauT+/+. Our key preliminary data show that enzymes for synthesis of the non-essential amino acid
taurine are upregulated with osteolineage differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells, and taurine is secreted in
the environment. Based on our pilot studies showing taurine synthesis by osteoprogenitors, a requirement for
LSC TauT expression for cancer growth, and expansion of osteoprogenitors in AML, we hypothesize that
osteoprogenitors sustain LSCs and support leukemia progression by secreting taurine. We will now test if TauT
expression is essential for disease progression in mouse models of disease, as well as for the propagation of
primary human leukemias. We will also determine if osteoprogenitors form a supportive microenvironment for
leukemia progression by secreting taurine. Collectively, these studies will establish the role of taurine from the
bone marrow osteolineage niche in myeloid leukemia progression. In the long term this work may lead to
development of new therapies targeting microenvironmental signals supporting cancer cells."
11072133,"ABSTRACT
Interactions of stem cells with their surrounding microenvironment are known to be essential for both normal
development, and for sustaining self-renewing adult stem cells, such as the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).
Since cancers often hijack developmental signals for their progression, it is likely that niche-driven signals that
sustain HSCs also influence the growth of leukemias arising from mutations in HSCs and early hematopoietic
progenitors, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (bcCML). Despite
recent advances in treatment, ~75% of AML patients still succumb to the disease, highlighting the need to better
understand mechanisms of disease progression. While much work has focused on leukemia cell-intrinsic
regulators, the role of the microenvironment in disease establishment and propagation is poorly understood. Our
overall goal is to define the role of leukemia-niche interactions on myeloid leukemogenesis. In support of a
functional role of the niche in disease progression, our work has shown that adhesive interaction of AML with
endothelial cells is critical to maintain the therapy-resistant leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Since osteoprogenitors
expand in the leukemic bone marrow, it is possible that these osteoprogenitors also create a cancer-supporting
microenvironment. As an alternate to identifying niche-driven signals promoting leukemogenesis, we determined
cell surface antigens expressed on LSCs that can act as receptors for these signals using our recent in vivo
genome-wide CRISPR screen. The 140 cell surface genes identified by our screen included those known to
promote leukemia growth (e.g., Cd47, Cd157) and novel regulators of leukemia progression. To focus on signals
likely to be cancer-specific, we selected a subset of novel cell-surface regulators with 2-fold higher expression
in human bcCML LSCs compared to normal HSCs in our new RNA-seq dataset. Of these, the taurine transporter
SLC6A6 (TauT) is of particular interest since its high expression is associated with poor prognosis in AML
(TCGA). Using TauT-/- mice, we find that genetic loss of TauT significantly impairs leukemia growth in vivo as
compared to TauT+/+. Our key preliminary data show that enzymes for synthesis of the non-essential amino acid
taurine are upregulated with osteolineage differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells, and taurine is secreted in
the environment. Based on our pilot studies showing taurine synthesis by osteoprogenitors, a requirement for
LSC TauT expression for cancer growth, and expansion of osteoprogenitors in AML, we hypothesize that
osteoprogenitors sustain LSCs and support leukemia progression by secreting taurine. We will now test if TauT
expression is essential for disease progression in mouse models of disease, as well as for the propagation of
primary human leukemias. We will also determine if osteoprogenitors form a supportive microenvironment for
leukemia progression by secreting taurine. Collectively, these studies will establish the role of taurine from the
bone marrow osteolineage niche in myeloid leukemia progression. In the long term this work may lead to
development of new therapies targeting microenvironmental signals supporting cancer cells."
10880061,"Most patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience a range of gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Meconium
ileus is present in about 10% of CF newborns. Later in life, the loss or dysfunction of the CF transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR) channel activity causes impairment in intestinal fluid secretion and
homeostasis, contributing to the development of constipation, distal intestinal obstruction, and other GI
diseases. In addition to CF patients, chronic constipation affects approximately 2-27% of general population
worldwide; it is one of the most common GI issues in geriatric population. In this proposal, we will address
these two health issues. Based on our previous findings and preliminary data, we hypothesize that (i) the
impairment in intestinal fluid secretion and homeostasis plays a critical role in the pathogenic process of
chronic constipation in CF patients and in geriatric population. (ii) CFTR-MRP4 complexes and the associated
secretory mechanisms are impaired in these two populations. And (iii) the CFTR-MRP4 complexes can be
targeted to restore the impaired secretion and alleviate/cure chronic constipation. Three specific aims were
designed to test our hypothesis: (1) test the regulatory role of CFTR-MRP4 macromolecular complexes in
compartmentalized cAMP/cGMP signaling and in the CFTR-mediated fluid secretion using intestinal stem cells
(ISCs) cultures from CF patients with chronic constipation. (2) test the effects of the current FDA-approved
highly effective CFTR modulator therapies (e.g., Kalydeco® and Trikafta®) and MRP4 inhibitors on intestinal
fluid secretion in enteroids from CF patients with chronic constipation, and study if these two types of
modulators have additive or synergistic effect. And (3) test if the CFTR-dependent fluid secretion in aged
mouse gut is impaired which contributes to chronic constipation and investigate the underlying molecular
mechanism. Our proposal incorporates both conceptual and technical innovations that will not only advance
our understanding of disease pathogenesis of chronic constipation in CF patients and in large ageing
populations, but also help identify possible therapeutic targets for interventions. We will use patient-derived
and clinically relevant samples and adopt a personalized medicine platform: a Bench to Bedside and Back
approach, which warrant a high potential to translate our bench-side findings to clinical disease management."
10880062,"Title: Control of Chromosome Segregation by DNA Topoisomerase II.
Abstract
Chromosome segregation errors result in aneuploidy, which causes birth defects and cancer. We have
defined a new mitotic Topo II-responsive control (TRC) that delays the cell cycle when Topo II activity is
insufficient for accurate chromosome segregation. This TRC mechanism is conserved from yeast to human
cells but has not been extensively studied. Activation of the TRC is triggered by stalling of the strand
passage reaction of Topo II, when the enzyme becomes trapped on DNA in the Closed Clamp structural
conformation. TRC activation requires two distinct modules within the catalytically inert C-terminal domain of
TopoII: (i) A cluster of SUMOylation sites, and (ii) The Chromatin Tether domain of Topo II, which interacts
with methylated nucleosomes. The central molecular model is that stalled strand passage leads to C-terminal
domain SUMOylation that functions as a signal-generating scaffold to halt the cell cycle. The conservation
between the human and yeast TRC responses provided unique opportunities to identify TRC components,
but gaps remain in our understanding of the mechanism of TRC activation. We aim to determine how the
TRC activates Mad2 to inhibit anaphase initiation, which will require determining the identity of the E3 ligase
that SUMOylates TopoII as well as the relevant substrates of Aurora B kinase. We will determine how
trapped Closed Clamps trigger TopoII SUMOylation and how they are repaired. The role of the ChT domain
will be determined and whether interaction with nucleosomes is required for TRC activation. The results of
these studies will impact opportunities for translational research because we will identify new potential
therapeutic targets. Our findings will also impact the use of widely prescribed therapeutic drugs that target
Topo II because we will gain mechanistic insight into cellular responses to Topo II inhibition. The preliminary
data and newly developed experimental tools place us in a unique position to determine the conserved
mechanism of this scarcely studied mitotic control."
10900173,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Diabetes is a heterogeneous disease characterized by chronic poor glycemic control, resulting in
pathological changes in tissues throughout the body. Chronic hyperglycemia causes the cardiovascular system
to undergo growth and remodeling (G&R) that is captured hypertension and increased arterial stiffness, both
significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Diabetes results in both cellular and matrix changes in arterial
health, and then each of these components further drive the pathological G&R by responding to the direct effects
of the disease. Fortunately, there exist medical and lifestyle interventions to help mitigate the diabetic disease
state and restore glycemic control. Large elastic arteries like the aorta serve as capacitors to absorb changes in
blood volume due to pulsatile pumping and protect the more fragile downstream microvasculature. Overall health
and stiffness of these large vessels is captured in the clinic via pulse wave velocity which is elevated in diabetic
patients, and there is evidence that the pulse wave velocity decreases back towards baseline following
restoration of glycemic control. The overarching objective of this project is to determine how hyperglycemia
affects aortic biomechanics and mechanobiology and whether restoration of normoglycemia is sufficient to
reverse these changes. To establish how arterial biomechanics are affected by hyperglycemia, I first employed
a diabetic mouse model to ascertain changes in active and passive wall mechanics, and these preliminary results
demonstrate that chronic hyperglycemia results in stiffer and hypercontractile murine aortas. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that chronic hyperglycemia results in cellular and matrix aortic G&R, and glycemic
recovery results in reversal of the cellular, but not matrix, phenotype, leading to partial rescue of aortic health.
To test this hypothesis, I will utilize an inducible mouse model of chronic hyperglycemia that can subsequently
be rescued by administration of Phloridzin. Experiments proposed in Aim 1 will determine the in vivo and ex vivo
biomechanical changes in aortic health due to hyperglycemia and following treatment. Aim 2 will then explore
how the tissue-scale mechanical changes arise by investigating how the matrix composition and cellular
phenotype are affected by the disease and treatment. The experimental work of the first two Aims will be coupled
with a multiscale, bio-chemo-mechanical computational model of aortic G&R in Aim 3. The computational model
will provide mechanistic insight into the roles of cells and matrix in disease progression and possible regression,
resolving information that is inextricable experimentally. Collectively, these data will elucidate aortic G&R due to
chronic hyperglycemia, whether these changes can be reversed by restoration of glycemic control, and the
mechanisms behind these processes. This proposed work will have broad implications in the conceptual
understanding of the cellular and matrix roles in diabetes-related cardiovascular pathologies and the
development of methodologies to explore biomechanical and mechanobiological changes in vascular health due
to disease and treatment."
10900253,"Summary
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects roughly 1% of the world’s population, and currently there are no
mechanism-based treatments that address the core features of ASD. It is now clear that the genetics underlying
ASD are complex; with several hundreds of genes conferring large risk as well as common variants contributing
to a large proportion of ASD heritability. Genetic studies of ASD suggest a high degree of convergence on
specific cellular processes and biochemical pathways, which have led researchers to posit that potential
therapeutic strategies may be shared across different genetic etiologies. The study of monogenic or syndromic
forms of ASD has been a leading strategy to gain insight into the complex mechanisms of ASD. Fragile X
Syndrome (FXS) is among the leading monogenic causes of ASD and is the most common inherited cause of
intellectual disability. Since the Fragile X gene (FMR1) was cloned in 1991, the field has used cellular assays
and model organisms to elucidate the functions of the FMR1 protein (FMRP), the consequences of its loss and
identify therapeutic targets for FXS and ASD. Other syndromic forms of ASD, such as tuberous sclerosis
complex, Rett Syndrome, Angelman Syndrome, and others, are being investigated using similar approaches.
Recent technological advances in stem-cell derived neurons, single cell sequencing, gene therapy, human
neurons and organoids are setting the stage for transformative advances in therapeutic development for these
neurodevelopmental disorders. This conference will bring together leading basic and translational scientists
studying ASD, Fragile X and related neurodevelopmental disorders from around the world with the ultimate goal
of developing mechanism-based treatments that address the core features of these diseases."
10903814,"Cocaine is one of the most commonly abused illicit drugs, and the negative impact of this drug is apparent
in the 2011 Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) report which revealed that >500,000 patients required
hospital emergency department services as a result of cocaine use. Despite the clear and compelling need,
there are no FDA approved medications for the treatment of cocaine use disorder (CUD). Cocaine produces
euphoria via the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (MCL-DA) system, also known as the reward system. Dopamine
release and transport systems within the MCL-DA are altered by both acute and chronic exposure to cocaine.
Over time and continued use, cocaine will produce adaptations in additional neural circuits resulting in impaired
executive function and decision-making processes and causing negative emotional affect for users. It has been
previously demonstrated that there is substantial interplay between MCL-DA activity and serotonergic neurons
that extend into this region of the brain. In addition, several studies have demonstrated that serotonin (5-HT)
releasing serotonergic neurons regulate the activity of dopaminergic neurons in these regions of the MCL-DA
system under both normal conditions and in the presence of cocaine. A link between DA and 5-HT7 signaling
suggests that modulating 5-HT7 signaling may be a viable and novel approach to CUD.
 In addition to the potential of 5-HT7 antagonism to regulate the MCL-DA system, our strategy in this program
stems from extensive literature demonstrating the role of 5-HT7 receptors in improving attentional set shifting,
reversal learning, and extinction in preclinical assays. By improving cognitive flexibility and facilitating extinction
learning in addition to modulating reward in the MCL-DA, we propose that selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonists
are the pharmacotherapy strategy needed in the treatment of CUD. We have identified a series of novel, drug-
like 5-HT7 receptor antagonists which reduced cocaine reinstatement in a well-established rat model of relapse
in our preliminary studies. We propose to test escalating doses of our first-generation lead in this cocaine
reinstatement model to achieve a full dose-response. Once achieved, we will build on our understanding of the
SAR for our 5-HT7 antagonists to identify novel, orally bioavailable, BBB penetrant lead compounds optimized
for advanced in vivo efficacy studies. We will test the effectiveness of our compounds to reduce ongoing cocaine
responding as a potential maintenance therapeutic and to identify behaviorally active doses to be advanced for
evaluation in a panel of cocaine reinstatement models including cocaine-, cue- and stress-induced reinstatement.
We hypothesize that our compounds will accelerate or augment extinction learning and reduce reinstatement of
cocaine responding whether produced by a noncontingent injection of cocaine, associated cues, or stress-
induced by injection of yohimbine. Leads identified in these in vivo screens will move forward as preclinical
candidates to use as medications to reduce the potential for relapse and improve treatment outcomes for CUD."
10900776,"PROJECT SUMMARY
African-American men (AAM) are known to present with more advanced disease resulting from both biological
and socio-economic factors. Specific to biological factors, there is emerging data suggesting that AAM with
prostate cancer (PCa) have an immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) characterized by
low DNA damage repair and high IFN-response pathway. Consequently, immune mediators and DNA damage
response may play a major role in PCa biology in AAM. The mechanism and potential therapeutic benefit of
combining immune modulators to disrupt the TIME for therapeutic gain in AAM with PCa is an area of active
investigation. Furthermore, whether immune-modulatory therapy has differential effects on immune cell-types
within the TIME of AAM vs. European-American men (EAM) is currently unknown. The proposed studies in this
application will first computationally deconvolute the TIME of AAM and EAM highlighting the functional
characteristics of key immune cells and soluble immune mediators. To overcome the limitation of cell line models,
we will use a novel bioengineered platform to study tumor-immune interactions and mechanistically define how
differences in the STING-IFN response pathway impacts response and/or resistance to immune modulators.
Next, we will evaluate how differences in the TIME from AAM and EAM may affect the therapeutic response to
immune-modulators using patient-derived explants – a unique ex-vivo model from fresh viable surgical
specimens. Importantly, we will also validate these results in serial patient-derived biopsies and blood samples
that have been collected as part of a phase II clinical study combining ADT, RT and immunotherapy
(NCT03543189). These studies will unravel mechanisms that can be exploited to identify new therapeutic
approaches to improve outcomes in AAM with PCa."
10900806,"Project Summary/Abstract: Viscerosensation is the communication between internal organs and the nervous
system. Viscerosensory signals are transmitted from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to the central nervous system
by both vagal and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. While vagal innervation of the GI tract is considerably
well-studied, far less is known about GI-innervating DRG neurons. Colon-innervating DRG neurons are critical
for normal GI function. These neurons detect the chemical/gut microbial contents of the GI tract, modulate long-
range control of GI motility, and are responsible for transmitting innocuous (non-painful) and noxious (painful)
sensations from the GI tract.
 Recent studies have identified five major subtypes of colon-innervating DRG neurons, defined by their
anatomical innervation patterns in the colon and ex vivo responses to stimuli. Colon-innervating DRG neurons
transmit GI-relevant information to the spinal cord. These neurons project to multiple laminae of the spinal cord
dorsal horn and are proposed to transmit information from the GI tract to a range of spinal cord interneurons and
projection neurons, including postsynaptic dorsal column (PSDC) projection neurons. However, few studies have
explored the anatomical organization of colon-innervating DRG neuron central arbors in the spinal cord. Further,
a comprehensive understanding of the spinal cord neuron types to which colon-innervating DRG neurons send
their diverse signals has yet to be explored. Finally, few studies have investigated the in vivo responses of spinal
cord neurons across dorsal horn laminae to non-painful and painful GI stimuli.
 The goal of this proposal is to characterize the central morphologies and postsynaptic partners of colon-
innervating DRG neurons. I hypothesize that colon-innervating DRG neuron central arbors will form distinct
morphological subtypes based on the types of sensory information they transmit. I predict that colon-innervating
DRG neurons that express the mechanosensitive ion channel, Piezo2, will project to deeper laminae of the dorsal
horn to transmit innocuous sensations to multiple spinal cord neuron types. Conversely, I predict that peptidergic,
colon-innervating DRG neurons that express the alpha form of Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (Calca) will
transmit painful stimuli to laminae I/II interneurons. I further hypothesize that PSDC neurons will receive
innocuous and noxious sensory information from the colon, through direct and indirect connections with colon-
innervating DRG neurons. Using conditional mouse genetics, surgical, viral labeling, imaging, optogenetic and
in vivo electrophysiological approaches, I will: 1) characterize the central arbors and postsynaptic partners of
colon-innervating DRG neuron types in the spinal cord, and 2) identify the in vivo response properties of spinal
cord neurons to innocuous and noxious colon stimuli. These experiments will advance our fundamental
understanding of DRG to spinal cord circuits responsible for detecting, transmitting, and processing sensations
from the colon. This research will provide critical insight, and may identify novel therapeutic targets, for GI pain."
10900807,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic pain and opioid use disorder (OUD) are major public health problems. Despite the alarming increases
in opioid misuse and OUD, few integrated treatments target both chronic pain and OUD. Integrated holistic
treatments are desperately needed that simultaneously address pain and opioid use, the fundamental causes
of pain and OUD, and that focus on whole person functioning and well-being among individuals with chronic
pain and opioid misuse/OUD. The University of New Mexico (UNM) Integrative Management of chronic Pain
and Opioid use disorder for Whole Recovery (IMPOWR) Center will take an integrated and holistic approach to
improving the lives of patients with chronic pain and opioid misuse/OUD via tailored intervention approaches to
meet the needs of diverse individuals in diverse communities. We will explicitly target increasing quality of life
and engagement in valued activities, the cultural centering of interventions to meet the needs of diverse patient
populations, and reducing stigma of chronic pain and opioid misuse and OUD. The approaches proposed in
our IMPOWR Center will directly target whole person functioning and well-being among individuals with chronic
pain and misuse/OUD. Our goals are to develop, test, and implement scalable, generalizable, and sustainable
provider- and patient-level interventions that are focused on improving functioning and can be delivered in
diverse health care settings. To maximize impact, we have established a diverse Stakeholder Consultation
Board (including people with lived experience and other stakeholders) and a Scientific Advisory Board
(including experts in chronic pain, opioid misuse/OUD, and implementation science), and aim to build a
sustainable workforce of researchers and providers devoted to ameliorating chronic pain and OUD via training
and mentoring. All Center projects will embrace principles of community-based participatory research, team
science, implementation science, economic evaluation, and open science. Consistent with our patient-centered
approach, assessment of opioid use and chronic pain will be complemented with measures of psychosocial
functioning and other important life domains, including stigma, engagement in valued activities, and quality of
life. Projects will include economic evaluation to measure cost-effectiveness of our interventions from a societal
perspective. Specific research projects will test the effectiveness, mechanisms, and implementation of an
integrated psychosocial treatment for chronic pain and OUD among individuals receiving buprenorphine from
outpatient OUD treatment clinics, and will use community-based participatory research methods to develop a
culturally-centered implementation intervention for screening and brief intervention of chronic pain and OUD
among American Indian/Alaska Native patients in primary care settings. Pilot projects focused on chronic pain
and OUD will be selected by our Stakeholder Consultation Board. The UNM IMPOWR Center is committed to
data harmonization, sharing of study resources, and provider training to enhance the reach, effectiveness,
adoption, implementation, and maintenance of evidence-based treatments for chronic pain and OUD."
10894719,"Project Summary
Memory CD8 T cells can be reactivated by a T cell receptor (TCR) signal, but also pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Reactivation in the absence of a TCR signal is referred to as bystander-activation and has been observed
across a wide range of different inflammatory processes, including infections, autoimmunity and cancer.
Bystander activated T cell exert effector function and secrete effector molecules such as granzyme B and
interferon gamma, which contribute to enhancing host immunity, but also exacerbate tissue damage and
prevent resolution of inflammation. The pro-inflammatory signals that elicit bystander activation have been
fairly well defined, but little is known regarding the regulatory signals that can inhibit or turn off effector function
by bystander activated memory CD8 T cells. In contrast, the mechanisms that negatively regulate effector
function of memory CD8 T cells that are reactivated in a TCR-dependent manner are well established. Our
preliminary data suggest that there are distinct regulatory mechanisms in place for memory CD8 T cells
reactivated by TCR- vs. cytokine-mediated signals. We specifically propose to study these mechanisms in the
context of tissue-based immune responses to determine how a perturbation of these regulatory systems
affects pathogen clearance, as well as tissue damage and re-establishing of tissue homeostasis. Ultimately,
our goal is to use the gained insights to develop strategies that will allow for therapeutic targeting of T cell-
mediated tissue damage."

 Symptoms of gastroparesis include chronic nausea and vomiting, early satiation, postprandial fullness,
abdominal distention and frequently pain. While initially conceptualized as a disorder of enteric motor
dysfunction (i.e., delayed gastric emptying), growing research suggests both (1) a disconnect between
symptom severity and emptying severity, and (2) largely ineffectiveness of treatments that target motor
dysfunction. Although the causes of gastroparesis can be multi-factorial, when the disease becomes chronic
and the severity of the symptoms result in a high impact on Quality of Life (QOL), complex pathologies may
begin to evolve in the enteric and central nervous system beyond just motor abnormalities contributing to other
sensory defects. Further profiling of biopsychosocial constructs in gastroparesis is needed, as such constructs
could be targeted by novel interventions. To accomplish these goals, we propose to continue with the New

will help recruit to our proposal of further gastroparesis patient characterization in the Registries and

10883762,"PROJECT SUMMARY – LIFE CORE
 The SEI Vision Research Group has a longstanding track record of using mouse models
to study ocular processes and disorders. The in vivo characterization of these mouse models is
carried out using the testing modalities provided by the LIFE Core. This resource has been
available since 1999 as part of the Nusinowitz Laboratory and, since 2009, has been a
component of the SEI Core Grant. With the growth of projects using a wide variety of mouse
strains and mutants, and the expansion of translational research projects to modify or rescue
ocular disorders, the LIFE component technologies are crucial for monitoring a broad range of
experiments in living animals.
 The LIFE Core component will continue to offer a broad range of in vivo functional and
structural testing customized to the needs of the investigator's research interests. The LIFE
Core will be used to define the structural and functional phenotypes in acquired or newly
generated mouse mutants to confirm whether they display the expected phenotypes, visual
behavior and/or electrophysiological responses. In addition, investigators will continue to use
the LIFE Core to document the natural history of disease in mouse models before they are used
for interventional experiments, including those that are viral vector, stem cell, or
pharmacologically based.
 The LIFE directors are committed to the provision of state-of-the-art non-invasive
imaging and functional analysis of mouse models of ocular disease. Equipment and software
algorithms are upgraded on a regular basis. We recently updated our Bioptigen sd-OCT to
provide higher resolution retinal images and have added new optical bores to image the anterior
segment in rodents. The latter is a new capability and highlights our interest in broadening the
relevance of this resource to other investigators at SEI. In addition, we acquired a new Celeris
Electrodiagnostics System for functional evaluation of the retina and visual pathway that will
replace an aging custom-made system. Over the next study period we will expand the imaging
capabilities by adding a Heidelberg HRA-II for wide-field imaging of fluorescent biomarkers and
autofluorescence, and we will continue to work with our colleagues at Doheny Eye Institute, our
affiliated eye hospital, to develop OCT-A for the mouse. Lastly, we will be adding behavioral
testing of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity with the optokinetic reflex, and developing new
behavioral paradigms to study rod and cone function in retinal degeneration."
10883764,"PROJECT SUMMARY – GCD CORE
The Gene and Cell Delivery (GCD) core will be a new component of the UCLA vision research
core grant. The establishment of this core is in response to the research demands by UCLA
vision scientists to deliver reagents to the retina, RPE, and other ocular tissues for the purpose
of investigating basic mechanisms and preclinical testing of therapeutic potentials. The GCD
core is consist of a biosafety level 2 (BSL2) viral vector production facility and a facility for have
a technical staff with molecular biology, cell culture, recombinant virus preparation expertise.
Ideally, the GCD staff will also have experiences of operating injection instrument and can teach
members of individual laboratories to perform subretinal and intravitreal delivery in neonatal and
adult rodents.
The GCD core will provide support for the production of recombinant viral vectors, mainly rAAVs
and lentiviruses. A website will be set up to provide available viral vector backbone information
and for individual labs to submit requests. Under the supervision of the core component director
Dr. X-J Yang, the GCD staff will use viral vector constructs and other necessary reagents
provided by individual investigator labs to perform transfection, harvesting, viral concentration,
and tittering procedures. The viral stocks produced by the GCD core will be tested by labs of
individual investigators.
The GCD core is equipped with necessary microscopes and micromanipulators to perform
intraocular injections in a designed BSL2 animal facility. The reagents to be delivered using
these equipment/instruments can range from nucleic acids, protein conjugates, nanoparticles,
recombinant viruses, small molecules, and human stem cell-derived cells. The same facility can
house post-operative mice deemed to need BSL2 containment.
The GCD core is expected to facilitate basic and preclinical research supported by NIH/NEI on
UCLA campus by providing effective tools and by enabling intraocular delivery in animal models.

10883766,"PROJECT SUMMARY – BMBI CORE
The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Instrumentation (BMBI) module is an essential core
resource that continues to be heavily used by the majority of our investigators to support the
preparation and analysis of biological samples. The BMBI core module resources consist of
common instrumentations such as autoclaves, various spectrophotometers, centrifuges,
incubators, microplate readers, immunoassay protein analyzers, polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) machines for DNA and RNA analysis. While most of these instruments are basic, their
utilization is extensive and critically important for the progress of research programs in each
laboratory. The majority of our core investigators employ basic biochemistry and molecular
biological approaches to prepare and analyze quantitatively and qualitatively various biological
samples. These include RNA, DNA, and protein samples obtained directly from tissue
specimens or extracted from heterologous cell- and non-cell-based protein expressing systems.
Besides the common instruments, this module has available specialized spectrometers for
detailed protein structural and functional analysis, including fluorescence, UV-visible
absorbance, Fourier transform infra-red, and customized circular dichroism (CD)
spectroscopies. In addition, sophisticated multi-angle and quasi-elastic light scattering
instruments are available. Our core investigators can determine gene expression profiles using
high throughput microfluidic assays, a next generation single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq)
PCR approach. A recently purchased automated Western immunoblot system allows for
quantification of low abundant proteins via a sensitive immunoassay reaction involving minimal
sample manipulation with data being analyzed digitally. Our newly acquired Molecular Devise
SpectraMax iD3 microplate reader permits quantification at multiplex formats (6 to 384-well) for
absorbance, fluorescence, and luminescence, thus enabling multiple biochemical assays at the
same time.
The BMBI module infrastructure and instrumentation capabilities are quintessential for our
investigators day-to-day scientific productivity by stimulating interactions among our researchers
and facilitating the quick integration of new recruits."

Translational Research (the Alliance) will integrate clinical and translational research
infrastructure and resources across a predominantly Hispanic U.S. jurisdiction to bridge the gaps
between basic and clinical translational research, to address severe health conditions that
disproportionately affect the medically underserved, and highly prevalent among Hispanic
populations. The long-term goal of the Administrative Core of the Alliance is to provide a model
for the optimal management and development clinical and translational research infrastructure in
resource-limited settings that provide care to medically underserved populations. The specific
objective of the Administrative Core will be to establish a leadership and management structure
that will ensure that the Alliance KCA’s and milestones are met effectively and efficiently and
when necessary realign the existing institutional and Alliance resources. This will be
accomplished through three specific aims: 1) Provide an integrated organizational structure,
leadership and advisory support system to effectively supervise, manage and monitor progress
of all the Alliance key component activities/cores leading to achievement of the proposed
milestones; 2) Develop and implement policies, procedures, and practices that ensure efficiency,
sustainability, and scientific and fiscal flexibility to accommodate the changing needs and priorities
of the Investigators, leading to new innovative and competitive areas of clinical and translational
research; 3) Provide timely financial, dissemination, communication and evaluation functions that
promote expansion of innovative clinical and translational research and services and long-term
sustainability of the Alliance. The proposed administrative structure will bring together key leaders
from the participating Institutions and external collaborators, further developing a pre-existing
collaborative structure that has been successful in obtaining external funding and developing
early-stage investigators. It will provide an efficient and integrated governance and administrative
structure that will ensure the optimal and cost-effective utilization of resources. This will ultimately

The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has recognized that underrepresented minority (URM)
faculty receive less mentoring and training than their nonminority peers and that this gap contributes to less
success in clinical and research careers. Thus, there is an urgent need to train qualified underrepresented
minorities (URM) clinician/scientists, RNs, Pharm Ds, basic scientists, behavioral and other health care
professionals, to fill in the demand for researchers that address the health needs of medically underserved
Hispanic and minority communities. The goal of the Professional Development Core (PDC) of the Hispanic
Alliance for Clinical and Translational Research (Alliance) is to design and coordinate trainings, support and
mentoring programs to address the need for more underrepresented minorities in clinical and translational
research and mentoring. The objective of the PDC is to design and coordinate competency based training,
mentoring, and support programs to maximize the productivity of potential CTR researchers and expand the
breadth and scope of CTR in focus areas of prevalent health needs: chronic disease prevention, achievement
of healthy lifestyles, emerging infectious diseases and health disparities. We hypothesize that providing these
activities to researchers with diverse backgrounds and incorporating community leaders to training sessions
will result in the development of a critical mass of URMs researchers addressing health issues in medically
underserved communities. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Address the current gap in research
competencies on health and healthcare research in URM-serving institutions through access to a coordinated
and effective educational and support program. Innovative use of technology-based training will expand
opportunities for potential trainees. Support provided for writing publications and developing proposals will
enhance productivity. 2. Address the mentoring gap for URM faculty by developing a robust mentoring program
aimed at fostering relationships that will enhance the productivity and retention of clinical and translational
researchers. The program will focus on two models: developing teams of mentors-mentees and training of
potential individual mentors. Interactions with recognized USA based mentoring programs as well as an in-
house program will enrich the mentors’ training. 3. Address community health needs by training scientists and
community partners jointly to carry out multidisciplinary research responsive to the Hispanic community needs.
The Professional Development Core and the other Alliance’s cores will collaborate in the implementation of a
tailor-made training curriculum.
The impact of the PDC training program is significant because it will support the development of qualified
researchers and mentors that understand, have the know-how, and are interested in addressing the health
needs of a growing US Hispanic and other medically underserved population."

The Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Research Design (BERD) Core of the Hispanic Alliance for Translational
and Clinical Research (Alliance) aims to provide expertise and support in the design, implementation, and
statistical analysis of research projects, as well as research methods training opportunities to Alliance
investigators, BERD staff, and the community, which will ultimately improve the health of Hispanic communities
in Puerto Rico (PR) and the United States. Our long-term goal is to improve the overall quality of clinical and
translational research studies conducted by Alliance investigators. Appropriate methods and analysis will
promote the advancement of research through further funding, and underpin the development of strategies to
prevent and treat diseases and conditions prevalent in Hispanic populations. Properly designed and conducted
(i.e., epidemiologically and statistically sound) studies will help ensure dissemination of results in high -impact
journals. Through a centralized unit with available expertise, we will address the increasing demand for
epidemiology and biostatistics services and contribute to the professional development of statisticians working
in Alliance institutions, especially in new and advanced methods. BERD Core has recruited and established
collaborations with experts with specialized knowledge from Alliance and other institutions, who would
otherwise not be available for Alliance investigators. Development and expansion of alternative funding
mechanisms will ensure long-term feasibility of these services. BERD will address the long-term goal with a
combination of proven and new mechanisms in the following aims: Specific Aim 1. Provide epidemiological and
biostatistical expertise and support for design, implementation, and analysis of clinical and translational
research projects focused on health conditions prevalent in Hispanic communities in Puerto Rico and across
the United States. Specific Aim 2. Develop and implement training programs to increase knowledge and skills
in research design, data management, and statistical methods, for Alliance investigators, BERD staff, and
community leaders and members. Specific Aim 3. Establish and strengthen working relationships of BERD with
other IDeA institutions and Clinical and Translational Research Centers (CTRCs), and other external
consultants. BERD expects that increased knowledge and improved support for researchers in biostatistics
and epidemiology will lead to improved quality of research and therefore more grants awarded and papers in
high-impact journals. Established, as well as innovative tools and methods, such as advanced user forums
and new statistical tools and macros, will strengthen BERD as a hub for epidemiology and biostatistics
expertise."
10883784,"Puerto Rico is experiencing profound health disparities in available health services and health outcomes. Many
of the reported disparities reflect lower availability and quality of health care in the island as compared to many
states in the US mainland. The stark disparities that emerge from studies of health and health disparities reflect
the relative invisibility of Puerto Rico in health care research, health policy discussion, and island -wide data
systems that inform US national data systems. Research programs that collaborate with the community to
achieve shared leadership can improve critical health behaviors, increase knowledge, improve practices, affect
social norms, lower disease incidence, and reduce poor health outcomes and mortality. The Community
Outreach and Engagement Core (CoEC) of the Hispanic Alliance for Translational and Clinical Research
(Alliance) aims to increase the multi-sectorial coordination necessary for the large-scale social change needed
to improve community health that affect Hispanic communities in Puerto Rico. The long-term goal of CoEC is to
catalyze and support meaningful Community Academic Partnerships (CAPs) to improve population health in PR.
Our main objectives are to establish the Core proposes to enhance and maintain community participation
through a new Community Health & Research Council, to help identify research priorities for health conditions
prevalent in Hispanic populations and assist in decisions-making for developing research initiatives addressing
community health. Community Health & Research Council will foster trust between communities and academia
to increase the participation of the community in Alliance research; and integrating diverse researchers and
community settings to identify key health conditions needing attention, and supporting those relationships with
mentoring, education, and dissemination. The CoEC will promote and enhance CAPs and employ a community
development approach in which citizens have a significant voice in determining the Alliance’s collaborative
agenda and resource allocation, while promoting co-learning and empowerment to attend to health and social
inequities. The core will build on community and academic strengths and resources to reinforce the relationship
with existing partners and expand to include new collaborators. Our goal and objective will be accomplished
through the following aims: 1) Enhance and maintain community participation in identifying research priorities for
health conditions prevalent in Hispanic populations; 2) Develop the capacity of Alliance investigators, core staff,
and community partners to address targeted health conditions through research, evidence-based, community
engagement, and mentoring; and 3) Improve dissemination of research designs and finding to stimulate adoption
of best practices for community engagement. The CoEC expects to ensure community participation in Alliance
decision-making to identify health priorities; to foster community research; and increase knowledge and skills of
its members through training, consulting and mentoring; and to disseminate research findings and stimulate

The research of Wyoming Sensory Biology Center (SBC) involves imaging of the nervous system in vivo and 
visualization of the regional distribution and concentration of proteins and transcripts associated with the 
development, aging, and function of the sensory and nervous systems. The University of Wyoming 
Microscopy Core has been built using the funds of the previous IDeA grants. During COBRE Phase I, the Core 
has provided support to researchers from 16 SBC labs and 32 non-SBC labs. The Core has been significantly 
expanded in space and scope. In response to the requests of the SBC members, the Core has acquired four 
new state-of-the-art microscopes and nine new pieces of molecular analysis instrumentation, primarily for the 
transcriptome and genome analysis. To reflect the expanded scope of services, the Core has been renamed 
Integrated Microscopy Core (IMCore). It is now comprising the Jenkins Microscopy Facility (JMF) and the 
Molecular Analysis Unit (MAU). The Phase I grant allowed SBC to leverage the expertise of the Core Director, 
Dr. Zhang, who holds a full-time, university-funded position. Dr. Zhang's leadership has been essential for 
sustaining the IMCore operations and for overseeing its expansion during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 
IMCore has made significant contribution to success of the SBC investigators, as evidenced by their increased 
research productivity, higher success in obtaining external funding, broader IMCore usage, and increased 
collaborations with non-SBC biomedical researchers at UW and seven Wyoming community colleges. The 
overarching goal of COBRE Phase II is to enhance the ability of SBC investigators and other biomedical 
researchers in Wyoming in their research pursuits. The following two specific aims are proposed for COBRE 
Phase II. Aim 1. To improve the organization of the IMCore and to expand the service capabilities in 
microscopy imaging and transcriptome and genome profiling of the sensory and nervous systems. Aim 2. To 
optimize the operational efficiency and enhance the long-term self-sustainability of the IMCore. Completion of 
these aims will help the IMCore: (1) to meet technical challenges and enable innovative research by SBC 
investigators, (2) to foster new and strengthen existing collaborations among SBC investigators, and (3) to 
prepare for long-term Core self-sustainability."

We request partial support for the Hemostasis Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) and Gordon Research
Conference (GRC) held from August 3-9, 2024, in Waterville Valley, NH. The 2024 Hemostasis GRC is the 36th
meeting in this series which is widely considered as the premier scientific meeting for hemostasis and thrombosis
research. The GRC/GRS fulfills the mission of the NHLBI in several important ways. First, the Hemostasis
GRS/GRC is an extremely important forum in the blood science arena in which the latest unpublished research
is presented and major advances in the field are unveiled. The meeting brings together researchers interested
in the biology, biochemistry, and genetics of blood clotting proteins and platelets; physicians treating bleeding
and thrombotic diseases, scientists from pharmaceutical companies developing new therapies for hemostatic
disorders. Seminal discoveries in hemostasis and thrombosis and allied fields have stemmed from interactions
originating at this conference. Free exchange of ideas and unpublished research, among all attendees, is a key
to the success of our programs. Second, emphasis of this conference on young and emerging investigators to
ensure the long-term sustainability of the blood science workforce. As such, the hemostasis GRC is preceded
by the GRS, a two-day program exclusively focused on trainees who are committed to research careers in
hemostasis and thrombosis. The GRS is organized and run by trainees. Third, and a major priority of the 2024
Hemostasis GRS and GRC programs, is to increase the diversity of participation by speakers and attendees.
Starting from the diverse composition of the leadership team, including the GRC Chair (Dr. Arepally)/Co-Chair
(Dr. Washington) and GRS Chair (Dr. Branfield) to the invited speakers/session leaders (including 38%
junior/emerging investigators, ~33% female investigators and 20% under-represented minorities) and a
dedicated session (GRC Powerhour) focused on issues of diversity/equity/inclusion, next year’s program will
establish a template for organizing future conferences as well as empower attendees to address racial barriers
and inequities at their home institutions. The 2024 Hemostasis GRC program features a Keynote Session on
lessons learned from the COVID19 Pandemic (The Pandemic: Looking Back & Moving Forward) and will be
given by two prominent physician scientists, Dr. Jeffrey Berger and Dr. Matthew Neal, who were at the forefront
of leading basic and clinical investigations. The 8 oral and 4 poster sessions focus on topics highly-relevant to
hemostasis/thrombosis research including sessions on emerging concepts and tools (“Advancing Frontiers in
Hemostasis”), in vitro and in vivo models of hemostasis (“Hemostasis: Models & More”), thrombotic disorders
(“Clotting Gone Awry”), fundamental mechanisms (“Hemostasis: Inside & Out”), vascular biology (“Blood in
Motion), structural studies (“Structure Meets Function”) and the biochemical basis of coagulation (“The Ties that
Bind Us”). Finally, we will continue to hold the “Hot Topics” session of Abstract Talks during which 8 trainees
present their work orally."

The following proposal was carefully crafted to foster achievement in both academic and professional
development to promote my future goals of becoming a faculty member at a tier-one research institute. The plan
is designed to enrich technical, conceptual, and professional realms of my training. I will gain technical training
in: (i) particle formulation and characterization, (ii) antibody conjugation chemistry in biomaterials, and (iii)
preclinical in vivo therapeutic testing in mice. While completing technical training, I will master conceptual training
in biomaterials, clinical concepts, and pregnancy-associated physiology. Concurrent with the technical and
conceptual benchmarks, my professional training will include: building a network within my field, strengthening
my leadership and mentoring abilities, learning how to communicate effectively through manuscripts and grants,
and developing my time management and project planning skills. The vast resources available at Vanderbilt
make it the ideal environment for my technical, conceptual, and professional training required to achieve my
long-term goal of becoming a leader in the field of obstetrics nanomedicine.
The studies proposed in this fellowship address the goal of developing a novel, uterine-specific, drug delivery
system to treat preterm labor - the leading cause of neonatal mortality worldwide. The true efficacy of current
tocolytics, used to inhibit premature uterine contractions, is unknown due to their adverse maternal and fetal
effects that occur if used greater than 48-72hr. I hypothesize that a uterine-targeted, slow-release drug delivery
system (DDS) would allow therapeutic concentrations of tocolytics for longer-term efficacy and reduced off-target
effects. Under the Sponsorship and Co-Sponsorship of Drs. Herington and Giorgio, I have generated
unpublished data that shows: (i) reproducible fabrication of poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid carriers with minimal
polydispersity, (ii) ex vivo tocolytic efficacy of nifedipine-loaded DDS, similar to that of free-drug, and (iii) targeted
DDS increased in vivo delivery to the uterus by 10-fold. Building on this promising data, the proposed research
strategy will improve the drug encapsulation and antibody targeting efficiencies of our DDS. In Aim I, modification
of the physical-chemical parameters in the formulation (such a polymer concentration, solvent type, surfactant
concentration, and initial drug load) will maximize encapsulation efficiency of current tocolytics: nifedipine and
indomethacin. Moreover, the specific chemical conditions that maximize antibody conjugation while maintaining
antibody selectivity to the oxytocin receptor will be developed. In Aim II, I will determine the in vivo efficacy and
side-effect mitigation of uterine-targeted DDS to delay birth in mouse models of induced preterm labor. The well-
known lack of uterine-selectivity and side-effects of nifedipine and indomethacin make them ideal for use in this
Aim, in which I will compare free-drug versus drug-loaded DDSs. The successful completion of the proposed
studies will solidify the basis of a much-needed therapeutic alternative to treat preterm labor: a uterine selective,
sustained-release drug delivery system."

The number of men living with and beyond a prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis exceeds 3.3 million and is
rapidly increasing in the United States. An estimated 30% of PCa survivors develop comorbid conditions (e.g.,
hypertension, heart diseases, and stroke). Comorbidity is the leading cause of mortality for PCa survivors,
surpassing mortality caused by PCa itself. A healthy diet protects survivors from comorbidities and improves
PCa survival outcomes, yet few PCa survivors adhere to a healthy diet. Moreover, PCa is often considered a
“couple’s disease,” as in both survivors and their partners perceive the threats of PCa to their health and life,
which may, in turn, increase their receptivity to adopting a healthy diet. Within an intimate relationship, it is
likely that one’s diet is influenced by both self-perceived and partner-perceived threats. However, these
interdependent relationships have not been examined among PCa survivor and partner dyads. Furthermore,
the connection of perceived threats to diet may be influence by factors at dyadic (e.g., relationship quality) and
neighborhood (e.g., area deprivation index and food access) levels. In addition, after PCa survivors and
partners perceive the threats of PCa, little is known about how they communicate and collaborate to adopt a
healthy diet. To address these knowledge gaps, we propose a multi-method study to investigate the process
through which PCa survivors and partners adopt and maintain a healthy diet during the PCa trajectory.
Adopting the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model as the analytic model, in Aim 1 we will examine the
interdependent relationships between perceived threats and diets and their changes over time. We will use
data from 280 dyads of PCa survivors and partners in the Prostate Cancer Education & Resources for Couples
(PERC) study (1R01NR016990-01A1). We will also assess how these relationships are moderated by dyadic
relationship and neighborhood conditions. For Aim 2 we will recruit 20 dyads of PCa survivors and partners at
the University of North Carolina Medical Center and conduct dyadic interviews supplemented with one-to-one
interviews to determine how they communicate and collaborate to adopt and maintain a healthy diet. This
study aligns with the research lenses of prevention and health promotion, social determinants of health, and
health equity in NINR’s 2022-2026 strategic plan. This proposed study, combined with the training plans for
career development, serves as my initial step towards becoming an independent behavioral and nurse scientist
to develop and test couple-based behavioral interventions for cancer survivors and partners."
10901514,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are lymphocytes that constitute ~5% of CD4+ T cells which suppress the activation of
other immune cells. While there is a detailed transcriptional understanding of T cell development, including the
development of Tregs, historically there has been little understanding of the translational regulation of T cell
lineage commitment and function, including that of Tregs. We recently demonstrated that Treg development
involves a novel, specialized translation mechanism carried out by a poorly investigated translation factor
complex we termed DAP5/eIF3d, that is independent of canonical mTORC1 and eIF4E. DAP5/eIF3d is an
alternate mechanism of cap-dependent mRNA translation which we discovered and recently showed is unique
to Tregs among T cell types. This work lays a foundation for studies in this renewal application to understand
how the novel DAP5/eIF3d mechanism controls Treg cell plasticity, function and stability, and integrates other
molecular regulatory events in Treg development and function.
 We hypothesize that DAP5/eIF3d specialized mRNA translation is required for the differentiation of Tregs
(tTregs, pTregs, iTregs) and involves specific m6A modification of Treg mRNAs. Studies are described in this
application to now more fully characterize how DAP5/eIF3d specialized mRNA translation regulates Treg lineage
commitment, the molecular mechanisms by which Treg mRNAs are selectively translated, including by an m6A-
DAP5/eIF3d mechanism. There is currently little understanding of translational regulation of Tregs, and no
understanding of the translational regulation of exTregs, which will also be investigated.
 Four Specific Aims have been developed to investigate the role of canonical eIF4E/mTORC1 versus
specialized DAP5/eIF3d mediated mRNA translation in Treg translational control of lineage determination,
stability and function. Aim 1. Characterize DAP5 dependent mRNA translation in development and stability of
tTreg and pTreg cell subtypes in the mouse. Aim 2. Investigate the role of DAP5 expression level in generation
of exTregs and Treg-exTreg phenotypic plasticity. Aim 3. Characterize mRNA translational reprogramming in
Treg subtype lineage commitment and function. Aim 4. Determine the role of m6A with DAP5 in selective
translation of Treg cell lineage determining mRNAs, suppression function and Treg cell stability."

Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and the more severe Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) are
driving increased rates of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the USA. Though obesity is a known risk
factor, the overlap between patients with obesity and NAFLD is incomplete, and a full understanding of the
mechanisms that govern onset and progression of NAFLD is critically lacking. In this proposal, I will probe the
role of the mitophagy receptor BNIP3 in the onset and progression of lipid accumulation in the liver to
inform future disease treatment. BNIP3 is a known mediator of selective mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy),
and we showed previously that hepatic BNIP3 expression is highly induced by fasting and has a marked effect
on metabolic homeostasis by decreasing mitochondrial mass. We have also shown that a liver-specific deletion
of BNIP3 causes spontaneous lipid accumulation in adult mouse liver. BNIP3 is more highly expressed around
the central vein of the liver, which is also the region where most lipid accumulates in Bnip3 null liver and in human
and mouse NAFLD. Our findings indicate that BNIP3 is a critical regulator of hepatic lipid homeostasis, and the
goal of this proposal is to define the mechanism of this regulation. My central hypothesis is that BNIP3
decreases lipid droplet (LD) content by promoting both mitophagy and LD autophagy (lipophagy) in
pericentral regions of the liver. I propose that it does so indirectly by facilitating the engulfment of small
LDs that are tethered to mitochondria targeted by BNIP3 for degradation at the lysosome.
 I have shown for the first time that isolated primary hepatocytes retain their patterns of zonal gene
expression for over 24 hours following culture outside their hepatic nutrient microenvironment. This allows me to
define for the first time the cellular processes modulating lipid metabolism in distinct zonal populations of
hepatocytes ex vivo. In Aim 1, I will use this finding to determine whether BNIP3 drives lipophagy to clear LDs
predominantly in pericentral hepatocytes. I will exploit machine-learning image analysis tools for unbiased
quantification of rates of mitophagic and lipophagic flux in discrete populations of primary hepatocytes, sorted
by their zone of origin, to test whether BNIP3 drives lipophagy more highly in pericentral vs. periportal
hepatocytes. I will test this finding in vivo by assessing whether exogenous re-expression of BNIP3 is sufficient
to clear lipid from pericentral regions of the liver in vivo. In Aim 2, I will test the hypothesis that BNIP3 promotes
small LD turnover by targeting small LDs “hitchhiking” on mitochondria to the autolysosome. I propose that
knockdown of well characterized LD-mitochondrial tethering proteins, such as PLIN5, will ablate the LD
clearance capabilities of BNIP3 by disrupting LD-mitochondrial contacts. My work elucidating the mechanisms
that lead to lipid accumulation in the liver may suggest novel ways to prevent NAFLD and NASH in the future."
10901351,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Spatial neuroscience has uncovered a great deal about how animals—primarily rodents—form allocentric
(world-centered) spatial maps of the world. Rodents explore by moving their bodies through the world. In
contrast, primates explore the world visually, and recent work suggests this could dramatically impact their
formation of allocentric maps. The current project investigates the brain systems that allow humans to form
allocentric maps of 3D spaces from afar, without physically visiting the locations being represented. This work
will use fMRI to detect map-like representations of viewed locations in a 3-dimensional “scene space” and to
compare these to map-like representations of visited locations in a virtual “navigable space”. This work is
divided into 2 aims, the first optimized for experimental power and the second optimized for ecological
validity. Aim 1 is to identify map-like representations of scene space and understand their
relationship to cognitive maps of navigable space. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) will be
used to quantify map-like allocentric representations of locations in scene space. Experiment 1a will identify
brain regions that support viewpoint-independent (allocentric) maps of viewed locations in scene space.
Experiment 1b will use an analogous procedure to identify brain regions that support viewpoint-independent
maps of navigable space and relate them to viewpoint-independent maps of scene space. Aim 2 is to identify
representations of scene space and navigable space using dynamic, ecologically relevant tasks.
This aim will leverage voxelwise encoding models to detect map-like neural representations of viewed and
visited locations while participants actively explore their environments. Experiment 2a will look for maps of
scene-space by scanning participants while they view the virtual courtyard from different viewpoints and
actively searching for a hidden target item. Experiment 2b will look for maps of navigable space by scanning
participants while they freely navigate through the virtual environment searching for hidden rewards. This
research will take place in the ideal training environment for the applicant. The sponsorship team's expertise in
the field of spatial navigation, advanced fMRI analysis and designs, and the computational modeling of freely-
navigating participants data are critical to the applicant's training goals. Further training is available through
coursework in machine learning and data science, computing resources, and a diverse set of relevant lab
meetings and seminars. This work addresses a critical gap in the literature between the fields of vision science
and spatial neuroscience. Understanding the role of the visual system in forming spatial maps in sighted
individuals could inform interventions aimed at mitigating navigational and other challenges faced by those
with low vision or other differences in sensory processing."

Connectivity” in September 2024 will assemble leaders in the field, junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows and
graduate students to discuss new, cutting-edge developments in the areas defined in the meeting title. This
proposal seeks support for the fourteenth of a biennial series of meetings held at Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory that has emerged as the premiere meeting in the world for this field. Topics to be discussed for the
2024 meeting will include: programs of circuit wiring, axon targeting, axon regeneration, synapse assembly,
synapses in neural circuits, and glial control of neuronal circuitry and neuronal repair. The planned sessions
and invited session chairs will emphasize new technologies and adverse experimental approaches.
Approaches include cell biology, biochemistry, genetics, structural biology, computational biology and
electrophysiology. Importantly, the meeting brings together research from multiple systems, including various
vertebrate and invertebrate model organisms and human stem cells for investigating neural connectivity and
function. Given the diverse approaches currently employed in this field, communication among international
researchers is essential to advance research and understanding of fundamental mechanisms that regulate
wiring of the nervous system and how these mechanisms may relate to the causes and potential cures for
neurological disease. Oral presentations will be selected by the session chairs in consultation with the
organizers. Each session will be chaired by two leading scientists in the field and the session chairs will give
presentations on their cutting-edge research. Selected speakers primarily include graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty. Three special lectures will be presented to provide essential
background critical to stimulating discussion between scientists working on related but distinct areas. There
will also be two poster sessions where a majority of participants can present their work. The meeting will be of
moderate size, and we expect 250-350 neuroscientists in attendance."
10900918,"Project Summary
A neuron’s activity history is precisely encoded in its gene expression profile. This molecular encoding is
achieved via transcriptional regulatory programs specific to distinct features of activity patterns. In particular, an
activating stimulus evokes unique, temporally segregated waves of transcription as a function of its duration.
The regulatory mechanisms which orchestrate the transduction of stimuli duration into temporal waves of
transcription have been described in heterogenous populations of neuronal cell types. However, whether
similar or distinct mechanisms operate to translate activity patterns into specific expression programs in
defined neuronal subtypes in vivo is unknown. We have established AFD, a pair of sensory neurons in C.
elegans, as a cellular model in which to describe the regulatory pathways that transduce neuronal activity into
gene expression changes. Via AFD specific RNA-Seq, we have shown that the duration of temperature
experience is encoded in AFD by temporal waves of gene expression reflecting similar waves described in
more complex organisms. These temporally regulated gene expression changes are critical for modulating
AFD functions. Preliminarily, bioinformatics analyses and experimental manipulations suggest that the CREB
transcription factor together with the SPR-4/REST repressor shape the temporal kinetics of temperature-
induced upregulation in a subset of genes. The goal of this proposal is to provide a systematic mechanistic
description of the molecular pathways by which the duration of temperature experience is encoded in the
molecular profile of AFD. Experiments proposed in Aim 1 will employ a multifaceted approach including
bioinformatics analyses, experimental deletions, and AFD-specific ATAC-Seq to identify cis-acting regulatory
motifs which direct activity-dependent transcription in AFD as a function of stimulus duration, and to determine
their role in the epigenetic control of gene expression. In Aim 2, these motifs will be linked to their cognate
transcription factors (TFs), and the mechanisms by which antagonism between activator and repressor TFs
shape gene expression programs will be investigated. Together, results from this work will provide a
comprehensive description of how a defined environmental experience is precisely translated into gene
expression programs in an individual neuron type in vivo to modulate neuronal properties."

mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Pathogenic mutations in genes encoded by both genomes give rise to
mitochondrial disease, many of which are neurodegenerative disorders that typically are both devastating and
ultimately fatal. Mutations in mtDNA genes affect structural subunits of the OxPhos system, whereas mutations
in nDNA genes are more numerous and diverse, as they encode not only a large number of OxPhos subunits
but also factors needed for the proper synthesis, assembly, and functioning of the OxPhos machinery.
 We recently discovered that in cells from patients with mitochondrial disease there is a significant
disruption in the intimate communication, both physical and biochemical, between mitochondria and
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at ""mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAM)"". MAM is a central locus for
maintaining cellular cholesterol, phospholipid, and calcium homeostasis, as well as regulating mitochondrial
bioenergetics and dynamics (organellar fusion, fission, and positioning). Based on this finding, we hypothesize
that reductions in oxidative energy metabolism can disrupt ER-mitochondrial communication, with serious
consequences for cell survivability that go well beyond that of reduced ATP output.
 The objectives of this application - and our Specific Aims - are thus threefold: (1) to deduce the genetic and
biochemical circumstances under which OxPhos deficits affect MAM (the ""phenotypic landscape""), by
analyzing cells from patients with known mutations in nDNA and mtDNA causing OxPhos deficiency, and by
perturbing bioenergetics with specific OxPhos toxins; (2) to gain insight into the mechanism by which this
occurs, using both biased (i.e. targeted) and unbiased approaches to identify OxPhos-related factors that affect
ER-mitochondrial connectivity; and (3) to determine if we can use either genetic or pharmacological
approaches to improve ER-mitochondrial communication in cells with genetically-compromised bioenergetics,
thereby revealing ""latent"" OxPhos potential (i.e. improved OxPhos output and efficiency) and increasing
bioenergetic output, even in cells with a high mutation load.
 Our discovery of an ""OxPhos-MAM connection"" has revealed a hitherto unknown pathogenetic role of
altered inter-organellar communication in mitochondrial disease. In turn, this has opened up a new way of
thinking about the pathogenesis and treatment of mitochondrial disease. A therapeutic strategy based on
""fixing"" ER-mitochondrial connectivity to re-normalize MAM function will likely be generalizable to a large
number of mitochondrial disorders."
10874570,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Gynecologic cancers are some of the most lethal diseases affecting women. Globally, one woman dies of
cervical cancer every two minutes. MRI is increasingly used in the evaluation of gynecologic and many other
cancers. Beyond its established use for cancer staging, there has long been an interest in the use of MRI-derived
quantitative metrics to gain insights into the tumor microenvironment. Parametric maps obtained from
quantification of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI data can be used to study tumor vascularity and identify
tumors that are better perfused and oxygenated and thus more sensitive to some treatments such as
chemotherapy and radiation. However, the relative slow imaging speed and motion sensitivity of current MRI
technology results in non-reliable and non-reproducible quantification of DCE-MRI data, which restricts its
application in clinical practice.
 Our group is a world leader in development of rapid motion-resistant DCE-MRI techniques, in particular using
combinations of radial imaging and compressed sensing. We developed the technique called GRASP, which
was conceived as an academic-industrial partnership and has now been successfully translated into standard
clinical practice. Though powerful, the first generation of GRASP has limitations. First, radial imaging is robust
to motion, but not free of motion, which usually results in blurring. Second, GRASP uses a very simple sparsifying
transform for compressed sensing, which can introduce issues with quantification. Third, GRASP was not
originally developed for pharmacokinetic analysis and misses important ingredients such as integration of AIF
estimation and T1 mapping. Fourth, image reconstruction time is still very long – in the order of several minutes.
 We have developed new advances to circumvent these limitations and offer a new DCE-MRI technique with
increased speed, motion-resistance and personalized AIF estimation and T1 mapping for pharmacokinetic
analysis. Following the PAR-18-009 guidelines, our main goal is to form an academic-industrial partnership
between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and General Electric Healthcare to translate these new
developments in quantitative DCE-MRI for use in patients with gynecologic and other type of cancers. Specific
Aims are as follows:
1. Develop and implement a fast motion-resistant quantitative DCE-MRI technique that goes beyond GRASP
 to offer increased speed and resistance to motion; dynamic T1 mapping; and personalized and automated
 pharmacokinetic analysis
2. Evaluate the repeatability, reproducibility and preliminary tumor response assessment of the fast motion-
 robust quantitative DCE-MRI technique (“DCE-new”) and compare DCE-new to standard of care DCE-MRI
 (“DCE-standard”) in patients with gynecologic cancer
3. Develop and evaluate fast image reconstruction algorithms based on deep learning"
10874466,"In the past two decades, we have taken large strides towards understanding the role of the microbiota (the
trillions of microorganisms inhabiting the human body) and the microbiome (their genes) in human health.
Individual microbial or viral pathogens are implicated in the etiology of many cancers, including gastric, colon,
and cervical cancer. Still more cancers likely arise from the interplay of many different microbial taxa, their
metabolic activities, the host’s genotype and immune system activity, and factors such as host diet, current and
former smoking status, and environmental exposures.
We propose to advance cancer microbiome research through three specific aims. This work will be performed
in the context of the popular QIIME 2 microbiome bioinformatics platform and the Qiita public microbiome data
repository and pooled analysis system. In our first aim, we will improve access to cancer microbiome
bioinformatics methods and data through the creation of a Galaxy interface for QIIME 2, improved support for
working with QIIME 2 in the R programming language and Galaxy GUI ecosystem, popular for cancer
research, the development of a resource for cancer microbiome pooled analysis, the development of a cancer-
focused microbiome bioinformatics workshop series, and by making QIIME 2 and cancer microbiome data
accessible from within the NCI Cloud Resources. Our second aim will develop a microbiome multi-omics
bioinformatics platform driven by the needs of the cancer research community through creating QIIME 2
plugins for metabolomics, metatranscriptomics, metagenomics, and metaproteomics with developers working
in these areas. Many important cancer microbiome projects have made advances by integrating these different
data types, yet considerable technical hurdles remain to making microbiome multi-omics bioinformatics
accessible by all researchers whose projects would benefit from these methods. To facilitate this, we will
create a microbiome multi-omics bioinformatics developer conference, following the model of our recent
Teaching and Developing QIIME 2 conference. Our third aim will improve the reproducibility of cancer
microbiome bioinformatics methods, and the reliability of cancer microbiome bioinformatics results, by
expanding several features related to tracking data provenance in QIIME 2, and helping users submit their
microbiome multi-omics raw data to archival repositories. Much of this work will occur in collaboration with NCI
Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) and Cloud Resources project teams, several of whom
we’re already beginning to collaborate with."
10874467,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Current tobacco treatment is limited by physicians infrequently prescribing cessation medication (<20%),
patients infrequently using cessation medication (~33%), and limited medication effectiveness (<30%). A
multilevel intervention to personalize tobacco treatment, based on substantial data linking genetically informed
markers to treatment response, has the potential to address these critical gaps by addressing multiple targets
in the cascade of treatment success. First, precision treatment may increase treatment effectiveness by
matching the smoker with the medication that maximizes efficacy and safety. Second, it may increase
physicians’ likelihood of prescribing because they expect precision treatment to be more effective than
standard treatment. Third, precision medicine may increase patients’ motivation to initiate and adhere to
cessation medication, as evidence suggests that smokers express desire for gene-guided treatment and
increased motivation to use it adherently. Emerging evidence including a recent Cochrane review and our
research suggests that patients’ ability to quit smoking and respond to cessation medication are associated
with multiple biomarkers involved in nicotine metabolism (i.e., nicotine metabolite ratio, NMR) and nicotinic
receptor function (i.e., genotype of CHRNA5 variant rs16969968). Evaluating precision treatment based on
multiple markers in a multilevel intervention using behavior change theories will advance the field of tobacco
treatment. Our preliminary work demonstrated: 1) promise of using both genetic and metabolic markers in
guiding treatment, 2) high interest in gene-guided treatment and its potential for enhancing medication use
among smokers, 3) higher motivation for smoking cessation with use of genetic risk communication feedback
tools, and 4) successful use of health informatics to implement a multilevel tobacco intervention in clinic
settings. The proposed study aims to test a multilevel intervention precision treatment intervention using both
genetic and metabolic markers, directed at physicians and patients, to increase the uptake and effectiveness of
tobacco treatment in primary care. We propose a 2-arm cluster randomized controlled trial of 40 physicians
and 800 patients who smoke randomized to usual care (UC) vs. precision treatment (PT) based on NMR and
genetics in primary care. We hypothesize that PT will enhance cessation success via increased physician
prescription of medication, patient adherence, and treatment effectiveness. In Aims 1 and 2, we will test the
impact of PT on physician prescribing, patient use of medication, and patient smoking abstinence. In Aim 3, we
will evaluate mechanisms of behavior change and implementation outcomes. The study reflects a significant
and innovative paradigm shift from a traditional treatment model to precision treatment that includes both
metabolic and genetic markers to motivate and guide tobacco treatment for both physicians and patients,
integrated within primary care."
10874468,"Abstract
This project focuses on the design and evaluation of prodrugs with dual pharmacological selectivity,
combining molecularly targeted mode of action with a tissue-specific, active uptake process (uptake-1)
to enhance drug delivery to aggressive neuroendrocrine neoplasms, including high-risk neuroblastoma
(NB) – the deadliest extracranial pediatric solid tumor currently lacking effective treatment options.
Norepinephrine transporter (NET) driving accumulation of norepinephrine and its functional analogs is
expressed by most solid tumors developing from sympathoadrenal precursor cells. However, tumor
radiotherapy targeted to NET has shown limited efficiency, while causing serious adverse effects due to
significant off-target distribution and extensive damage to healthy tissues. Centered on a dual-selective
experimental drug delivery strategy integrating the uptake-1 process with a replication-dependent mode
of drug action to confine the pharmacological effect to proliferative tumor cells expressing NET, this
project aims to evaluate and optimize a pharmacotherapeutic approach designed to effectively combat
refractory disease not responding to existing treatments, while minimizing toxicity to healthy organs and
tissues. In our proof-of-concept experiments, a tripartite prodrug design integrating NET affinity with
unique molecular targeting of a potent and selective topoisomerase I inhibitor was shown to be
essential for achieving sustained intratumoral drug presence and markedly extended survival in
clinically relevant models of aggressive neuroblastoma. Guided by these results, we hypothesize that
dual-selective pharmacotherapy using NET-targeted prodrugs can provide a selective, safe and
efficient way of treating different forms of high-risk disease. We also hypothesize that potency and
selectivity of this approach will be enhanced by combining it with clinically proven small-molecule
agents modulating tissue-specific expression of NET. These hypotheses will be tested by pursuing the
following specific aims: Aim 1 studies will focus on comparative evaluation of polymeric carrier-linked
prodrug constructs with regard to their cell uptake and growth inhibitory effects on primary NB cells and
cell lines with different phenotypes, as a function of their molecular design and the potentiating action of
the NET expression enhancing agents; Aim 2 and Aim 3 studies will comparatively evaluate the
biodistribution profiles and therapeutic effectiveness of a series of tripartite prodrugs, with the goal to
identify and optimize key construction variables, to establish feasibility of pharmacologically modulating
NET expression for improving drug delivery and treatment outcomes, and to examine the roles of tumor
phenotype and disease status in clinically relevant models of aggressive NB. The proposed research
focusing on NET-targeted prodrugs equipped with dual pharmacological selectivity is significant by
informing the development of a new strategy for treating aggressive NB and other refractory cancers."
10874593,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Neurodegenerative diseases are among the fastest growing clinical burdens on society, and in the next 20 years
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is projected to overtake cancer as the second leading cause of death in adults. Despite
AD prevalence, there are currently no therapeutic interventions to combat the underlying pathology driving
disease progression. While much is still not understood about neurodegenerative pathogenesis, the
accumulation of extracellular amyloid- plaques and intracellular tau tangles are undisputed hallmarks of AD. To
combat disease progression, an attractive therapeutic strategy is to investigate impairments in native proteostatic
mechanisms used to dispose of this neurotoxic protein accumulation. One such mechanism which has been
implicated in the development and progression of not only AD, but numerous neurodegenerative proteinopathy
disorders including Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease, is the autophagy-lysosomal network (ALN). The ALN
is a bulk degradative system utilizing vesicular transport to dispose of large protein aggregates which contribute
to neuronal dysfunction. This process relies on the active remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton to initiate, capture,
and transport neurotoxic cargo for degradation and maintain proper proteostasis. However, mechanistically how
dysregulations in cytoskeletal dynamics are associated with neurodegenerative pathology contributing to
disease remains unclear. Through multiple behavioral neurodegenerative screens, we have identified an actin
depolymerizing factor, cofilin, along with its upstream molecular regulators, which upon modulation improve
neurodegenerative behavioral deficits and lower tau accumulation in vivo. This proposal seeks to investigate
how cytoskeletal dynamics contribute to AD through genetic attenuation of the cofilin-centric cytoskeletal
remodeling pathway. I hypothesize that modulating the activity of cofilin and its regulators will ameliorate
AD neurodegenerative phenotypes via modification of the cytoskeleton and proteostasis. Aim 1 will utilize
behavioral and histological approaches to investigate how genetic modulation of numerous genes within the
remodeling pathway influence neurodegenerative phenotypes in tauopathy Drosophila and mouse models. In
Aim 2, I will investigate mechanistically how this cytoskeletal remodeling pathway is involved in the formation
and progression of the ALN through 1) measuring changes in neurotoxic protein accumulation upon cytoskeletal
genetic modulation using various tauopathy model systems, and 2) utilizing high resolution microscopy
techniques in AD patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) along with biochemical in vitro assays,
to investigate how genetically modulating cofilin disrupts various phases of the ALN. Upon successful completion
of this project, we will identify molecular impairments of cytoskeletal remodeling associated with
neurodegeneration that are involved in proteostatic imbalances and disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, we
hope to identify novel therapeutic targets within this pathway capable of treating not only AD, but multiple
neurodegenerative diseases caused by neurotoxic protein accumulation."
10874594,"Technological advances in medical care have increased the survival of very preterm infants (VPT; <32
gestational weeks). However, there is converging evidence of cascading disruption to neurological
development resulting from VPT birth. Findings consistently link atypical neurological development in VPT
infants with lasting mental health problems in the broader VPT population. Specifically, atypical white matter
and grey matter development in VPT infants predict developmental deficit in self-regulation that are linked to
later to emerge psychopathology of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and clinical rates of internalizing
and externalizing behavioral problems in VPT children. Innovation is urgently needed to treat neurological and
psychiatric diseases in the growing VPT population. The proposed research will test a promising treatment
solution. Our prior work has identified parental responsiveness as a modifiable psychological variable with the
potential to improve VPT child neurodevelopmental outcomes through our highly effective parenting
intervention. Two significant barriers limit implementation of parenting interventions in the clinical setting. First,
parenting programs are often considered un-scalable because the most effective parenting interventions are
home-based and thus expensive to implement. Second, the potential benefit of increased responsive
caregiving to VPT childhood brain development is unclear because this possibility has never been evaluated
via clinical trial, making it unknown how increasing responsiveness drives child outcome. In the context of a
randomized controlled trial, the proposed study will overcome these barriers by:
1) Testing if participation in a scalable web-based intervention to increase responsive parenting results in
 more normative brain development and improved self-regulation in toddlers born VPT.
2) Testing if the acting mechanism of any behavioral and neuroanatomic alteration resulting from intervention
 is mediated by improvements in parent responsiveness.
To accomplish these objectives, parents of VPT children (age 15-28-months) will be randomized to a web-
based parenting intervention or an active control condition. During intervention one-on-one instruction will be
provided via videoconferencing to increase parent responsiveness behaviors and support personal reflection
on how to adapt newly acquired responsiveness behaviors to their child’s changing developmental level. We
will collect pre- and post-intervention assessments to evaluate: 1) parental responsiveness behaviors, 2) VPT
child behavioral outcomes and 3) VPT child neurological outcomes utilizing EEG to measure neural functioning
and MRI to measure structural connectivity. This research applies neuroimaging methodologies in a novel
way: by leveraging the inherent neuroplasticity of the brain in early childhood to identify intervention related
effects on brain maturation and function. Findings from this study could result in a paradigm shift that includes
interventions focusing on the parent as an active participant in their child’s developmental success."
10903280,"Substance use disorder (SUD) affects 8.5% of the United States population with many individuals who go
through cycles of abstinence and then relapse to drug taking. Stress is one of many factors that can potentiate
drug relapse and a key neural circuit involved in stress-potentiated drug seeking behavior involves neurons in
the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Emerging evidence has shown that
CORT can regulate the endocannabinoid signaling system in a rapid and glucocorticoid receptor independent
manner. Previous studies from our group indicate that CORT rapidly mobilizes 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)
in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) pyramidal neurons which activates cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1Rs) on
GABAergic axons to inhibit GABA release in a retrograde manner. We hypothesize that this effect of CORT
decreases inhibitory synaptic transmission, thus increasing excitability of neurons in the mPFC that comprise
output pathways that mediate motivation and promote cocaine seeking in abstinent rats. However, the precise
mechanism through which CORT rapidly mobilizes 2-AG is unclear. The purpose of this research project is to
examine the overall hypothesis that Gq-coupled GPCR signaling is required for the rapid CORT
mobilization of 2-AG in the PFC and that this mechanism underlies CORT-dependent effects of stress-
potentiated relapse in substance use disorder. To test this hypothesis, I will utilize ex vivo whole cell
recordings, a self-administration/cocaine seeking paradigm, an eCBGRAB2.0 approach, and fiber photometry. In
Aim 1, I will conduct ex vivo whole cell recordings of PFC pyramidal neurons to assess GABAergic
neurotransmission and photometry in brain slices following eCBGRAB2.0 expression to directly measure 2-AG
release to examine the mechanism by which CORT recruits endocannabinoid signaling at this synapse. I will
examine the requirement for CORT induced Gq-mediated signaling to increase 2-AG synthesis. In Aim 2, I will
study rats in a self-administration/cocaine seeking paradigm alongside fiber photometry following the
expression of an eCBGRAB2.0 biosensor to study endocannabinoid concentrations within the mPFC during
CORT-potentiated reinstatement of drug seeking. Successful completion of these aims will enhance our
understanding of the mechanism by which CORT mobilizes endocannabinoid signaling and increase our ability
to design therapeutic interventions towards SUDs. The associated fellowship training plan aligns with these
research aims and leverages my development as a research scientist and interactions with my mentorship
team to enhance my technical, intellectual, and professional development to support my goal of becoming an
independent investigator working in an academic environment. The environment in the Department of
Pharmacology at the Medical College of Wisconsin has high-quality instrumentation for the proposed studies

by PDEs, modulate a number of critical physiological processes across the lifespan. As such, targets within
these signaling cascades have long been of high interest to drug discovery efforts, particularly in the context of
aging-related diseases. Indeed, we are seeing the fruits of our labor with many PDE inhibitors in the clinic

new light on the physiology of these cascades and reveal sophisticated mechanisms by which targets may be
manipulated for therapeutic gain. A fresh systems-level approach will be taken, with a given session focusing
on the same target in the context of different organs/diseases. By bringing together academic and industrial
scientists at all career stages from the fields of aging, cancer, cardiology, immunology & inflammation,
neuroscience/psychiatry, pulmonology, etc., the conference hopes to advance drug discovery efforts by
stimulating deep discussion of the potential for efficacy versus side effects. The GRC will include 62 speakers

10904430,"Summary
All major forms of diabetes result from a deficit of functional β-cells. Thus, it is critically important to develop
therapies to preserve and expand β-cell mass. We have demonstrated that Nrf2, the master transcriptional
regulator of antioxidant enzymes, plays a significant role in modulating β-cell mass. Nrf2 protects -cells from
oxidative stress, but the mechanisms, external cues, and signaling pathways that regulate Nrf2 are incompletely
understood. We recently found that Nrf2 activation expands cell mass, preserves -cell identity and insulin
content, and improves glucose tolerance after a high caloric diet. Treatments that increase cAMP through G
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs; for example, agonism of Gs-linked EP4 prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptors
or the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), or antagonism of Gi-linked EP3 PGE2 receptors), also lead to increased β-cell
proliferation, retention of β-cell identity and protection of β-cell mass after challenge with cytokines or glucose
toxicity. Importantly for this proposal, our published and preliminary data suggest that Nrf2 is activated by and
necessary for the effects of PGE2 receptor modulation and for the effects mediated by GLP-1 receptor agonists.
In this proposal our assembled team is uniquely positioned to explore the relationship between Nrf2 activation
and other pathways known to protect β-cells from oxidative stress, retain β-cell identity, and promote adaptive
β-cell expansion. We hypothesize that the Nrf2 pathway is a common junction between eicosanoid and incretin
signaling and thus is a critical nexus of β-cell preservation, identity, adaptation, and function; therefore, Nrf2 is
crucial for these agents to improve functional β-cell mass in diabetes. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that
activation of Nrf2 and EP3 antagonism and/or GLP-1R or EP4 agonism work together to enhance β-cell
proliferation and β-cell protection from oxidative stress. Specific Aim 2 Identify β-cell-specific Nrf2 targets and
characterize the transcriptome and chromatin landscape of Nrf2 activation, EP3 antagonism, and/or GLP-1R or
EP4 agonism as these treatments preserve β-cell mass. Specific Aim 3 Explore the in vivo therapeutic potential
of combined Nrf2 activation with EP receptor modulation and/or GLP-1R agonism. These studies will provide
key mechanistic information, identify new β-cell-specific gene targets, and test the therapeutic potential of three
attractive and inter-related pathways that will be of great value to the field for the therapeutic preservation and
expansion of functional β-cell mass highly needed in diabetes."

marmoset models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) developed in the Research Projects. The MDCC will optimize
state-of-the-art protocols in neuroimaging, behavioral testing and cognitive assessment, and biomarkers
assays to perform longitudinal evaluations from birth through the emergence of disease onset. Neuroimaging
protocols will follow the ADNI-3 data acquisition and processing pipeline to obtain PET measures of amyloid,
pathological tau, and glucose metabolism, MRI measures of brain structure, and measures of task-free and
task-based functional MRI. The MDCC will also optimize ultrasound imaging protocols to assess arterial
stiffness and blood velocity. A behavioral testing pipeline will be developed, optimized, and validated, and will
be used to characterize aging phenotypes in marmosets with test-retest reliability. Finally, the MDCC will
perform measurements of fluid-based blood serum and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and correlate them with
functional, behavioral, cognitive, and neuroimaging changes. Work in the MDCC work will lead to the
characterization and validation of marmoset models of AD, which will be invaluable in translational research to
elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of AD and contribute to developing new therapeutics for AD."

Coronavirus Infection Dynamics and Cross-species Transmission in Bats
Prevention of future zoonotic disease emergence, including pandemic threats, is only possible with a thorough
understanding of infection dynamics in reservoir host populations. The emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS, and
SARS-CoV-2 highlight the need to examine bat-borne coronaviruses in their natural environments. Disease
dynamics and cross-species transmission events in bat populations are complex and remain poorly
understood, despite evidence suggesting that cross-species transmission has shaped coronavirus diversity
and evolution and that viruses with broad host ranges may have increased pandemic potential. Understanding
the longitudinal infection dynamics and the ecological conditions under which coronavirus cross-species
transmission events occur will characterize the processes underlying virus emergence in bats. I hypothesize
that coronavirus cross-species transmission dynamics are driven by host ecology and environmental
conditions.
In Aim 1, I will assess ecological drivers of cross-species transmission of coronaviruses in bats. Using viral
surveillance data standardized across 30 countries with over 50,000 individual bats sampled, I will assess the
likelihood of coronavirus cross-species transmission using an evolutionary Bayesian phylogenetic approach.
Covariates examined will include host-genetic similarity, roost-type, reproductive characteristics, conservation
status, and geographical home-range overlap. Cross-species transmission of bat-borne coronaviruses may
play an important role in increasing the distribution of viruses and pandemic potential.
In Aim 2, I will characterize longitudinal dynamics of coronavirus infections in bats in diverse roost locations. I
will lead local fieldwork in California (USA) to characterize seasonality and diversity of coronavirus infections in
primarily single-species roosts. In Myanmar, I will collaborate with an international team to examine longitudinal
dynamics and additionally assess risk factors for coronavirus positivity. The coronavirus and ecological data
generated will help parameterize models to understand the role of cross-species transmission in outbreak
thresholds, thereby revealing mechanism underpinning viral emergence.
My proposed work has specific relevance towards understanding the dynamics underlying the origins of SARS-
CoV-2 and could inform on future pandemic threats. This study will provide actionable insights into public
health risks, especially for local communities that are most likely to be first exposed to emerging diseases."
10903177,"Project Summary
The “Netrin system” has well-studied roles in axon pathfinding and less studied roles in synapse
formation in animals from worms to humans. I propose to study the relative contribution of UNC-
6/Netrin derived from multiple neuronal and non-neuronal sources by characterizing the expression
and phenotypic effects of cis-regulatory alleles of unc-6 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We
hypothesize that deleting different sections of the cis-regulatory region of unc-6 will result in alleles
that lose expression in subsets of neurons and non-neuronal cells, depending on the locations of
transcription factor (TF) binding sites that regulate expression in these cells. This work will enable me
to identify circuit organizer TFs and their binding sites that regulate unc-6 expression in different cell
types and neuronal circuits, and may enable me to distinguish between unc-6-expressing cells required
for axon guidance and synapse formation. To achieve these goals, I will pursue two specific aims.1)
Generate cis-regulatory alleles of unc-6. 3) Assess the functional consequence of neuron-type specific
expression of unc-6. I have identified the neurons expressing unc-6 in WT worms expressing an unc-
6::sl2::gfp::h2b reporter allele generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering, using the
NeuroPAL system to identify individual neurons. I will generate cis-regulatory alleles of unc-6 by using
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering to delete portions of the unc-6 cis-regulatory region, and
assess the which neurons lose expression in each cis-regulatory mutant. To assess the functional
consequences of neuron-type specific expression of unc-6, I will use reagents that enable the
visualization of neurites and synapses of neurons to assess the circuit-specific effects of unc-6 cis-
regulatory alleles on axon pathfinding and synapse formation. Through this work, I will elucidate the
regulation of unc-6, as well as its function in axon guidance and synapse formation in various neuronal
circuits. Through the pursuit of this project, I will develop skills in rigorous hypothesis-driven research,
literature review, written and oral communication of research results, and mentorship that I will need
to become an independent neurogenetics researcher. Dr. Hobert's lab and Columbia University are an
ideal environment in which to pursue the proposed project and my postdoctoral training. The lab has
made many impactful contributions to the neurogenetics field, Dr. Hobert has an excellent training

Targeted protein degradation is an exciting new strategy in drug discovery. Such drugs have
several potential advantages: (1) new protein targets must be synthesized to reverse the effect
of the drug, potentially prolonging efficacy; (2) all the domains of the target protein are
inactivated, potentially eliciting different responses than inhibition of a single active site; (3)
each drug molecule can inactivate multiple target molecules, making efficacy event-driven
rather than occupancy-driven, potentially lowering dose and (4) simple binders can be
converted into functional compounds, which may address targets considered “undruggable”.
The rational design of drugs inducing target degradation has almost exclusively focused on a
single over-arching strategy: localization of the target protein to a ubiquitin E3 ligase. The
primary role of ubiquitination is to localize the target protein to the proteasome, and experiments
from several laboratories demonstrate that proteasome localization is sufficient to induce
degradation. These observations suggest a ubiquitin-independent strategy for targeted protein
degradation, wherein a target recognition ligand is linked to a proteasome binding ligand
(proteasome recruiter). Direct localization to the proteasome avoids issues with E3 ligase
localization strategies. Proteasome recruiters also have the potential to be tissue, compartment
and cancer-specific. The goal of this transformative grant is to demonstrate the feasibility of
proteasome recruiters using three strategies: (1) Localization to the 19S regulatory particle; (2)
Localization to a proteasome shuttle factor and (3) localization to the alpha ring of the 20S
proteasome."

The most common malignant pediatric brain tumor is medulloblastoma. Despite advancements in treatment,
medulloblastoma survivors have significant long-term medical side effects and increased all-cause mortality.
That is why novel, more effective, and safe treatments are direly necessary. One treatment challenge is that
medulloblastoma tumors can disseminate via the bloodstream and cerebrospinal fluid leading to worse
prognosis. The underlying mechanisms that promote metastasis in medulloblastoma are not clearly
understood. One method we used to identify potential key regulators in the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma
is by analyzing microarray and single-cell RNA sequencing data. We mined publicly-available datasets along
with our data from genetically engineered models of the SHH subgroup of medulloblastoma to identify
differentially expressed genes compared to non-tumor brain cells. We identified BAIAP2 and CDC42 to be
differentially expressed and have higher expression in medulloblastoma compared to other brain cancers.
BAIAP2 and CDC42 are known to be implicated in migration, invasion, and actin polymerization. Several
studies demonstrate an interaction between BAIAP2 and CDC42 in multiple cell types. However, BAIAP2 and
CDC42 have yet to be studied in medulloblastoma. We hypothesize that CDC42 interacts with BAIAP2 in
medulloblastoma cells to facilitate tumor pathogenesis. For the first aim of my proposal, I will assess whether
the BAIAP2-CDC42 interaction promotes invasion and migration in medulloblastoma. To further investigate
this, we conducted siRNA-mediated gene knockdown of BAIAP2 and CDC42 in ONS-76 cells, representative
of the SHH subgroup of medulloblastoma. Our preliminary analysis shows that BAIAP2 and CDC42 are highly
expressed in medulloblastoma, and knockdown of BAIAP2 modulates CDC42 expression. Further, we
determined that cell proliferation and migration were reduced upon BAIAP2 and CDC42 knockdown. Our
findings suggest that BAIAP2 and CDC42 have a role in the migration and proliferation of medulloblastoma
ONS-76 cells. The second aim of my proposal is to determine whether the BAIAP2-CDC42 interaction is
necessary for MB invasion and tumor growth in spheroid culture and in vivo. We will utilize siRNA-mediated
knockdown to determine the effect of BAIAP2 and CDC42 knockdown in multiple models of medulloblastoma
including cerebellar organoids and medulloblastoma spheroids. We are currently in the process of validating a
compound screening to target BAIAP2 and CDC42. These compounds will be tested in medulloblastoma in
vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo to determine potential candidates. There are non known compounds that target the
BAIAP2-CDC42 interaction, let alone BAIAP2 alone. Altogether, our preliminary findings indicate BAIAP2 and
CDC42 as possible targets for future studies in medulloblastoma. Our proposal will be the first to define
and characterize the potential oncogenic roles of BAIAP2 and CDC42 in medulloblastoma."

Immune evasion is a hallmark of cancer. Various tumor immunotherapy treatments, such as immune checkpoint 
blockade and cancer vaccination, have been developed to overcome cancer’s ability to avoid immune detection 
and destruction; however, the result of these endeavors have not been satisfactory given a number of critical 
barriers. One of these barriers, and a prominent mechanism by which cancer evades immune surveillance and 
elimination, is through the cancer cell expressed CD47 to ligate SIRPα, an ITIMs-containing inhibitory signaling 
receptor expressed on macrophages, which serves as a negative regulator that inhibits macrophage 
phagocytosis, proinflammatory response and antigen presentation. In our studies, we discovered “Phago-Act”-
a proprietary reagent that downregulates SIRPα expression and empowers SIRPα-deficient macrophages
(SIRPαLow MØs) to be an initiator for triggering potent innate and adaptive anti-cancer immunity. Not only do they
directly phagocytose cancer cells (“liquid”/non-adherent cancer in particular), but SIRPαLow MØs are also capable 
of conducting immunogenic antigen presentation to robustly activate tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells (Tc) with 
high tumoricidal activities, leading to rapid elimination of late-stage, large-size solid tumors with distal lesions 
(mimic metastases). The results of SIRPαLow MØs-initiated responses, which are especially effective in solid 
tumors, have been vetted extensively in various pre-clinical solid tumor models including cancers of pancreatic, 
colorectal, lung, breasts and skin (melanoma), all of which resist advanced anti-cancer therapies including 
immune checkpoint inhibitors and their combinations with RT and other modalities. Moreover, SIRPαLow MØsinduced tumor elimination also leads to long-lasting anti-cancer immunity that prevents recurrence. The goal of 
this fast-track STTR is to leverage these important research findings and to accelerate their translation to clinical 
implement of scalable SIRPαLow MØ-based immunotherapy – “SIRPant Technology” – to treat a broad spectrum 
of cancers and prevent relapse. Our current focus is Solid Tumors. In Phase I, we will extend current studies 
and establish reproducible protocols for producing human SIRPαLow MØ from PBMC (Aim I-1). Phase II is to 
fund specific IND-enabling CMC refinement (Aim II-1) and toxicology studies (Aim II-2) needed for a Phase I
clinical trial, as well as patient applicable SIRPαLow MØs delivery strategies in combined with RT or/and immune 
checkpoint inhibitors (Aim II-3). (These discoveries and therapeutic developments are protected by our filed
patents)"
10904120,"Project Summary
 Bone fractures and non-union defects often require surgical intervention where devices are used to correct
the defect, and 1-5% of these procedures are compromised by bacterial infection with annual hospital costs
exceeding $1.9B. Current treatments are limited to sustained, high systemic doses of antibiotics and surgical
debridement of affected tissue. These corrective procedures significantly drive healthcare costs and have sub-
optimal patient outcomes as effective antibiotic doses are difficult to attain at the infection site due to the presence
of a biofilm and toxicity considerations. Furthermore, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria raises
concerns regarding the effectiveness of current antibiotics. The objective of this renewal application is to
engineer synthetic hydrogels co-delivering lysostaphin and antibiotics to eliminate established bacterial
infections and promote bone repair in murine and ovine models. Our central hypothesis is that hydrogel-based
delivery of lysostaphin and antibiotics will synergize to eliminate staphylococcal infections and result in bone
healing in murine and ovine models of implant-associated bone infection. This research will establish a localized
and translatable strategy to effectively eliminate established bacterial infections to support bone repair. Aim 1.
Engineer antimicrobial hydrogels for the treatment of infected bone fractures in murine models of bone repair.
Aim 2. Engineer hydrogels co-delivering antimicrobial agents and BMP-2 to eliminate established bacterial
infection and repair non-healing segmental bone defects in mice. Aim 3. Evaluate the ability of antimicrobial
hydrogels to mitigate bacterial infection and support bone repair in a plate-stabilized osteotomy infection model
in sheep. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on engineering hydrogels that locally deliver
antimicrobial agents to eliminate bacterial infection, modulate inflammation, and support bone repair. This novel
strategy represents a more effective and safer alternative to current systemic antibiotic regimens and antibiotic-
releasing bone cements. This research is expected to yield the following significant outcomes. We will establish
an injectable antimicrobial hydrogel for the repair of infected bone fractures and non-healing bone defects. We
will analyze the efficacy, safety, and biological mechanisms of these biomaterials in murine and ovine models of
implant-associated bone infections."
10904122,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This proposal seeks funding to support increased participation from a diverse group of scientists,
researchers, and clinicians and to enhance professional development programming targeted towards early
career researchers (ECRs) during the congresses of the International Society of Electrophysiological Kinesiology
(ISEK) over a five-year period. ISEK is a multidisciplinary organization composed of members from health-related
fields including biomedical sciences and engineering, physical education, physical therapy, and other disciplines.
The Society promotes research and teaching in the disciplines of electrophysiology and kinesiology of the
sensory and motor systems in unimpaired and pathological conditions, with emphasis on the interactive use of
our namesake disciplines. A main aim of our congress has always been to provide opportunities for ECRs,
including PhD students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty, to interact with each other and with established
researchers. The focused nature of ISEK and the strength of its congress make these interactions meaningful.
Over the next five years we will leverage these strengths to expand the impact of our congress for a diverse
group of researchers and ECRs, as the long-term relevance and sustainability of a professional society is
determined by its support for these members. Though ISEK has a long history of participation from ECRs with
delegates attending from across Europe, America, Asia, Oceania, and Africa, we are committed to do even more
and to centralize our activities so that they are not so dependent on the local organizing committee for each
congress. In 2020, we formed a Diversity Committee to increase representation, equity and inclusion in our
Society, and an Early Career Researcher Committee to give representation to our junior members. These efforts
have strongly shaped the content of this proposal and the activities it will support.
 Our proposal has three specific aims. The first is to broaden participation and inclusivity within ISEK; we have
designed strategies to increase the participation and representation of underrepresented groups, including
women and researchers from underrepresented geographical areas using travel grants and caregiving grants.
Our second aim is to increase professional development activities for ECRs at our in-person congresses; this
will be accomplished through the inclusive design of our program and through scientific and social events
targeted to this group. Our final aim is to strengthen ISEK community through virtual meetings in years without
an in-person congress; we have designed two innovative virtual conferences to accomplish this goal.
Implementing these activities will ensure that ISEK continues to be the leading society in electrophysiology and
kinesiology, promoting an inclusive environment that fosters the development of the next generation of
neuromuscular health researchers and the diversity of ideas that they bring to our field."
10904576,"Maternal cardiovascular and hemodynamic adaptations during pregnancy are critical for accommodation, growth
and development of the placenta and fetus. Insufficient changes in cardiovascular function can lead to pregnancy
complications including hypertension and represent a major risk for maternal and fetal health. The causes and
mechanisms leading to maladaptations are not entirely understood. We aim to develop a dynamical model of
cardiovascular function throughout pregnancy that will serve as a tool to aid understanding of cardiovascular
adaptations and maladaptations in pregnancy and guide development of personalized therapeutic interventions.
 Dynamical modeling uses differential equations to describe the behavior of a system, and in contrast to statistical
modeling allows computation of the outcomes of experiments that are significantly different from the ones used to build
the model. The model's initial conditions and parameters are determined by patient's phenotype and genetic makeup,
and by varying them one can simulate a wide variety of patients. A virtual patient's development can be analyzed
through numerical solution of the model equations. The impact of risk factors, individual treatments, and combined
effect of treatments aimed at various therapeutic targets are simulated through proper modifications of the equations
and parameters. Therefore, dynamical modeling is a perfect tool for development of personalized treatments. It has
been successfully applied to research of cancer, diabetes, arthritis, stroke, metabolic, hematologic, and autoimmune
diseases. However, to date there is no dynamical model of cardiovascular adaptations throughout pregnancy.
 We aim to fill this gap by developing such a model based on synergy and integration of fluid dynamics,
biomechanics, mathematical modeling, and simulation. We will first develop a compartmental non-pulsatile model of
circulatory patterns in major organs and vessels, including the uterus, and their changes throughout pregnancy. This
approach provides flexibility, mathematical convenience, and accommodates required features. Then we will test and
refine the model by simulating physiological changes known to be associated with pregnancy hypertension and known
therapeutic interventions that alleviate the hypertension. Finally, we will perform sensitivity analysis to make the model
parsimonious and to gain insights into the order of significance of various pathophysiological mechanisms and the
relative potential of various therapeutic interventions.
 In the future, the model may be used for in silico testing of novel therapeutic targets, management strategies, risk
assessment, modeling of O2 and nutrient supply to the fetus, and combined effect of a patient's characteristics leading
to development of hypertension, even when each individual characteristic is in the normal range. Innovation lies in
integration of existing knowledge and previously developed models of individual organs and their role in hemodynamic
regulation, incorporation of the uterus and its changing hemodynamics over the course of pregnancy, utilization of data
previously omitted from modeling efforts (e.g., placenta MRI, Doppler US measurements of blood flow), and the
extended time scale of the model spanning most of pregnancy. The impact of fetal sex will be modelled explicitly."
10891231,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mayo Clinic Chemical Center (MCC) is funded to perform targeted metabolites and exosome cargo
measurements in samples collected in the Clinical Centers of MoTrPAC.
As advised by the steering committee, we have expended a substantial amount of time developing an innovative
methodology to isolate plasma exosomes and demonstrated reproducibility in multiple experiments, at different
time points and by different laboratories. We propose exosome-based proteome and miRNA analysis in a limited
number of samples. Based on power calculations, we estimated that the proposed number of samples will detect
significant changes in exosome proteome and miRNA responses to aerobic and resistance exercise training. We
will also test a hypothesis that proteome and miRNA release after acute exercise will be different in people who
are highly active in comparison with sedentary people, because the prior exercise training accretes specific
exercise-induced proteins in tissues that will be released during and immediately after both modes of exercise.
These measurements will be done in 140 sedentary people and 110 highly active people and will likely offer
unique new information. In addition, 55 sedentary people will be evaluated at baseline and following 3 months
each of aerobic and resistance training with 30 sedentary controls studied after a 3-month control period.
Secondly, in alignment with metabolomic measurements done at other centers, we will perform measurement of
two quantitative targeted metabolites-amino metabolites and organic acids in plasma and skeletal muscle. These
targeted metabolites are chosen based on their biological relevance to exercise training, and the quantitative
and reproducible data anticipated from our assays would complement large scale metabolites measured in other
Chemical Centers. The targeted metabolome measurement will also offer an opportunity to potentially
understand the biochemical pathways involved in exercise benefits. We chose muscle and plasma
measurements of organic acids representing the substrates of the citric acid flux pathway and amino metabolites
which, based on many preliminary studies, are shown to sensitively respond to exercise with distinct responses
to aerobic and resistance exercise.
Both targeted metabolites in muscle and plasma as well as exosome-based measurements of proteome and
miRNA are anticipated to reveal novel information on how specific exercise programs may benefit physiological
functions. We anticipate that the results from our study in combination with the ongoing multiple omic
measurements in all chemical centers will likely unravel deeper insights on how exercise benefits multiple
organs. Our objective is to advance the translational potential of exosome cargo by administering biological
molecules offering exercise benefits via small vesicles like exosomes to multiple organs in the body. The
metabolites, especially targeted metabolites, are likely biomarkers to monitor responses to the administered
vesicles carrying potentially beneficial molecules."
10902920,"The objective of these studies is to better understand submucosal biology as it relates to implantation
of cell therapy devices. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is employed to access the gastrointestinal
(GI) submucosa for excision of lesions, therapeutic myotomy, and even peritoneal access. Expansion of this
technique to include device implantation could enable novel approaches to long-term delivery of therapeutics,
including cell therapies, to the GI tract. However, the biology of the submucosal space as a host for
implantable devices is not well understood. The long-term goal is to leverage the GI submucosa as a host for
regenerative therapies in the treatment of degenerative or autoimmune GI pathologies. The central hypothesis
of the proposed work is that the submucosa can serve as an effective host for cell therapies. A model involving
pancreatic islet transplantation into the gastric submucosa for the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D) will be
employed, inspired by the finding of subepithelial heterotopic pancreatic tissue (or “pancreatic rests”)
incidentally found on biopsies of the stomach. The pancreatic islet is a compelling cell model as there are
existing animal models for T1D and validated assays to quantify islet survival and function. The rationale is that
evaluation of the gastric submucosa as a potential host for cell therapies may not only lead to breakthroughs in
the treatment of T1D, but also localized treatment of degenerative GI disorders in which normal tissue has
been compromised. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing 3 specific aims: 1) Evaluate endoscopic
procedure technique and safety for submucosal implantation in a swine model; 2) Characterize in vivo host
response to submucosally implanted materials and devices; and 3) Determine encapsulated islet survival and
function as well as phenotypic rescue. For Aim 1, a swine model will be used to evaluate outcomes and
complications of ESD with and without device implantation, using devices of various geometries. To achieve
Aim 2, tissue histology, immunofluorescent staining, flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and scRNA-seq will be used to
evaluate the host response to ESD/device implantation as compared to the more common methods of
subcutaneous and intraperitoneal implantation. For Aim 3, devices containing a test dose of allogeneic islets
will be implanted into the gastric submucosa to evaluate islet survival and function (using immunofluorescent
staining, RT-PCR, and scRNA-seq), and if successful, therapeutic doses will be implanted in a T1D swine
model to evaluate for phenotypic rescue. The proposed research is significant as it will demonstrate a novel
approach to GI device delivery and improve understanding of submucosal biology as it pertains to device
implantation. Ultimately, this will contribute not only to the field of T1D and cell therapies, but also offer
valuable insights for the future development of submucosally implanted localized treatment of other disorders,
including degenerative GI disorders. This project will provide unparalleled training experience to the applicant
in the translational aspects of implantable device design, large animal models, and submucosal biology."

(CEDC) is responsible for outreach, engagement, communication and dissemination of results for Georgetown’s
P50 Center for Excellence
. The CEDC
will facilitate investigators’ efforts to build equitable, sustainable,
meaningful, and collaborative relationships with DC community members. In collaboration with the Community
Advisory Board and Investigator Development Core, the CEDC will design work with early career investigators
to engage with members of the Washington DC community, share results and, ultimately, strive to implement
results from research into sustainable change. Community engagement requires investigators to learn cultural
humility, how to create equitable partnerships, identify and approach community partners, create equitable
research budgets, and design relevant outreach materials. The CECD will develop and implement methods and
structures for investigators to engage with community members. This will include overseeing the engagement of
community members in DISCOVER’s activities such as community members’ participation in a launch meeting
and “Idea Lab” sessions where investigators brainstorm ideas. The CEDC will partner with many DC based
organizations such as Nueva Vida (Latino cancer), the Stroke Comeback Club, and Community of Hope (Black
maternal health). These community meetings will be structured to maximize co-learning and equitable dialogue
and minimize power differentials. CEDC will also lead community-based rotations for early career investigators
to gain experience in community engagement. Finally, the CEDC will be responsible for providing
recommendations and best practices for dissemination of information from DISCOVER research to the
community across multiple levels, including: overseeing and supporting investigators holding community grand
rounds, distributing newsletters to relevant community partners, and sharing health disparities research with
other DC stakeholders. The CEDC will enrich not only the experiences of early career investigators focused on
health disparities research, but also the health and well-being of racially minoritized DC residents who experience
health disparities in cancer, stroke and maternal health."

Substantial health inequities exist for Hispanic children. Recent national statistics indicate Hispanic youth are
nearly twice as likely to be obese as non-Hispanic white youth. Cardiometabolic risk indicators are also
elevated among Hispanic children relative to children of other ethnicities. The identification of risk and
resiliency predictors of poor health during childhood and adolescence from a longitudinal and developmental
perspective will provide specific targets amenable to preventive public health interventions. We propose to
capitalize on longitudinal data collected by an NIH-funded study of very low-income Mexican American
mothers and youth (Las Madres Nuevas) that assessed a multitude of cultural, biological, family, and
environmental risk and protective factors from the prenatal period through ten years of age, including 13
objective measures of child weight and health beginning at birth. We propose to leverage this existing
longitudinal dataset and evaluate weight gain and cardiometabolic health trajectories, and additional risk and
resiliency factors at child ages 12-13 and 15-16. The COVID-19 pandemic and racial tensions in the U.S.
provide natural ecological stressors that can disrupt normally-developing trajectories or worsen at-risk
trajectories. With data collected recently on the impact of these stressors on youth, the project is ideally
situated to examine health-related consequences of these significant social and environmental challenges. In
combination, we will: 1) Examine trajectories of child weight gain from birth to age 15-16 years and associated
cardiometabolic health consequences (e.g., blood pressure, HbA1c, cholesterol, CRP, IL-6); 2) Examine
macro-level social, cultural, and environmental risk and protective factors (e.g., negative racial climate,
concentrated disadvantage, neighborhood opportunity) that influence developmental trajectories in weight gain
and cardiometabolic health. 3) Examine proximal influences (e.g., acculturation and cultural values; maternal
and child mental health; family feeding and behavioral practices) on trajectories of weight gain and
cardiometabolic health; 4) Conduct a nuanced examination of ecological and salient major life events (e.g.,
COVID, puberty) that potentially divert weight gain and cardiometabolic trajectories, focusing on the unique
characteristics of youth who are relatively unaffected, recover, or are chronically affected. The proposed study
utilizes data from biological measures, anthropometric measures, parent report, youth report, medical records,
and observational protocols. Our scientific approach emphasizes the cultural embeddedness of healthy
development, with the view that health equity can best be achieved by understanding sociocultural and
economic forces that shape eating behavior and weight gain. This project holds great potential to address
central questions about contributors to weight gain and obesity risk in a high-risk group, and enhance
opportunities for prevention of obesity and associated health problems."
10898302,"As high as 60% of all in-hospital cases of acute kidney injury events are a result of nephrotoxic drug exposure.
In injury, studies have demonstrated that susceptible endothelial cells are capable of transdifferentiating to a
pathogenic myofibroblast phenotype through a process known as endothelial to mesenchymal transition
(EndMT). This transition is difficult to study in vivo due to the highly regulated spatiotemporal morphological
changes of individual cells and modified cell-cell communications with resident epithelial cells. In vitro human
kidney organoid models are well suited for studying kidney disease, due to their capacity to recapitulate nephron
epithelial cell types, however, organoids have notoriously lacked endothelial cells, which renders modeling
endothelial injury moot. Our group has developed a novel method for generating highly dense endothelialized
human kidney organoids using a transgenic vasculogenic induced pluripotent stem cell line. These organoids
contain a robust endothelial network that closely interacts with all nephron cell types previously found in human
kidney organoids. Based on preliminary immunofluorescence, electron microscopy and transcriptomic data, I
hypothesize that kidney organoid co-culture of engineered endothelial cells enables the induction of
kidney-specific endothelial maturation (Specific Aim 1). To examine this, I will use electron microscopy,
immunofluorescence, and western blotting to understand whether there is a morphological presence of
fenestrations and an endothelial glycocalyx layer. I will also compare transcriptomically, engineered endothelial
cells to published datasets of human kidney endothelial cells, examining pathways of endothelial maturity and
kidney specificity, while simultaneously determining whether kidney organoid co-culture enables advanced
alignment with human clinical samples. In addition, based on preliminary immunofluorescence data, I
hypothesize that following nephrotoxic exposure, endothelialized human kidney organoid endothelial
cells undergo EndMT, and this process is critically regulated by TGFb (Specific Aim 2). Endothelialized
organoids injured with nephrotoxin, doxorubicin, will be examined with immunofluorescence and FACS by
tracking GFP+ engineered endothelial cells through injury to understand quantitatively the percentage change
of mesenchymal transition. TGFb inhibition will also be used to understand whether this process can be
ameliorated. Uninjured, injured, and injured + TGFb inhibition endothelialized human kidney organoids will be
compared transcriptomically with snRNAseq to determine computational alignment to existing published
datasets of injured endothelial cells having undergone EndMT and to determine upregulated pathways of TGFb
as well as master transcription factor regulators. The studies in this proposal represent a significant and
innovative step forward for the field of kidney disease because these studies uncover critical knowledge in
understanding endothelial cell maturation, shed light on one key mechanism of endothelial injury, and lay the
groundwork for future development of targeted therapeutics combatting drug-induced kidney injury."

Our overarching goal is to develop a novel theranostic prostate-cancer-specific CAR-T cell paradigm that will
allow for successful targeting of antigen-heterogeneous neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) under image
guidance. Our proposal and experiments are based on the observation that NEPC develops in most cases
through increasing de-differentiation from the clinical state of castrate-resistant disease; along this trajectory,
DLL3 expression increases and PSMA expression decreases on tumor cells. Hence, targeting DLL3 as well as
PSMA with a bi-specific immunotherapeutic is a logical choice when developing a novel targeted therapeutic
approach for this disease state. Our approach takes advantage of existing institutional expertise in developing
CAR-T-cell-based therapeutic strategies following very encouraging clinical outcomes in hematologic
malignancies and in mesothelioma. Here, we aim to extend this approach to metastatic NEPC. We realize that
translation of the clinical CAR-T cell success in hematologic malignancies to metastatic solid tumors must
overcome several obstacles. It necessitates systemic delivery of CAR-T cells, and any therapeutic success will
require the delivery of CAR-T cells to metastatic sites in sufficient quantity, their survival and potent effector
function at these sites, and the prevention of tumor immune escape due to plasticity and heterogeneity of
targeted surface antigens. Therefore, we have designed a series of experiments to address these challenges in
logical sequence. Our research team combines expertise in CAR-T cell design, development of T-cell tracking
techniques, translation of novel imaging probes in prostate cancer, and clinical trial design. We will conduct a
series of pre-clinical studies in order to refine the technology and prepare for translation in patients with NEPC.
We will begin by evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of DLL3-specific CAR-T cells in NEPC models and
determining the lower DLL3-expression threshold on cancer cells for CAR-T tumoricidal effect. Next, we will
develop DLL3/PSMA-bi-specific CAR-T cells and evaluate their ability to eradicate tumors with heterogeneous
DLL3 and PSMA expression using real-time multi-reporter bioluminescent imaging. To facilitate clinical
translation of this approach, we will verify that these bi-specific CAR-T cells can be tracked by PET imaging with
the clinically approved 18F-MFBG radiotracer, and their efficacy predicted and measured using the clinically
established DLL3- and PSMA-specific radiotracers 89Zr-DFO-SC16 and 68Ga-PSMA, respectively. In summary,
this proposal brings together translatable CAR-based therapeutic and imaging components in genetically
engineered T-cells, allowing for non-invasive monitoring of CAR-T cell trafficking, tumor targeting, and tumor
response. Of note, the theranostic paradigms that will be developed and validated in this proposal can also be
translated and used to address comparable clinical questions in other DLL3-positive malignancies."
10898321,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Macrophages play a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis by tightly regulating the inflammatory response.
In response to endotoxins like lipopolysaccharide, they undergo dynamic reprogramming, transitioning from
a pro-inflammatory to suppressive to tolerant state, resulting in endotoxin tolerance. In this tolerant state,
the inflammatory response to repeated endotoxin exposure is dampened. This can be protective, but
insufficient or excessive tolerance can cause hyperinflammation or immunosuppression as seen in sepsis.
The underlying mechanism of this process, particularly the contribution of long-term metabolic change,
continues to be a key knowledge gap. We found there is a persistent and sustained long-term decrease in
acetyl-CoA levels in stimulated macrophages based on preliminary data. However, the role of acetyl-CoA
metabolism – a central metabolic pathway – in endotoxin tolerance remains unknown. This proposal aims
to investigate the role of acetyl-CoA metabolism in mediating endotoxin tolerance induced by classical
activation in macrophages. The specific aims are to (1) determine how acetyl-CoA availability affects
histone acetylation in endotoxin tolerance, (2) profile the global effect of acetyl-CoA metabolic
reprogramming on non-histone protein acetylation in endotoxin tolerance, and (3) characterize the
role of acetyl-CoA metabolism in endotoxin tolerance in murine models. To achieve these aims,
endotoxin tolerance will be recapitulated in cell lines, primary cell cultures, and murine models, while acetyl-
CoA availability will be modulated using different genetic perturbation and treatment approaches.
Identification of histone acetylation changes will be achieved through immunoblotting for selected acetylation
sites and genome wide histone acetylation changes identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing
with resulting gene expression changes determined by quantitative PCR. The global acetylated proteome
will be profiled by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the in vivo characterization of endotoxin tolerance will
be accomplished by measuring serum cytokine levels and clinical phenotyping. This study focusing on the
reprogramming of acetyl-CoA metabolism in macrophages aims to provide mechanistic insights into how the
metabolic state of macrophages influences endotoxin tolerance. By understanding this relationship, we can
gain valuable knowledge about how metabolic reprogramming impacts immune cell function and identify
potential therapeutic targets within acetyl-CoA metabolism to regulate the inflammatory response. The
Morgridge Institute for Research and the University of Wisconsin-Madison offer a strong foundation for
conducting this project, given their extensive metabolism research. With the support and guidance from Dr.
Jing Fan and collaborators, the project is expected to be completed efficiently. Through this training plan,
the applicant will develop essential technical, scientific communication, and additional cli nical skills and
knowledge, paving the way for a successful career as an academic physician-scientist."

Individuals with Down syndrome (DS), the genetic condition caused by trisomy 21 (T21), are predisposed to a
spectrum of heterogeneous diseases while simultaneously protected from developing other pathogenic
conditions relative to the typical population. In ways still poorly defined, T21 protects individuals from most solid
malignancies while strongly predisposing them to Alzheimer’s disease, congenital heart disease, leukemias,
autoimmune disorders, and diverse neurological conditions. However, little is known about the mechanisms
underlying this differential clinical profile or the relationship between these conditions in the context of DS versus
when occurring in the general population. Moreover, individuals with DS display a large degree of phenotypic
variation suggesting the existence of modulating factors that affect how T21 manifests at the individual level,
including genetic variation, epigenetic modifiers, varying endotypes modulating the transcriptome, proteome and
metabolome, lifestyle and environmental factors, or even perhaps the microbiome. Therefore, elucidating the
mechanisms driving and modulating DS comorbidities will serve not only the six million people worldwide with
DS alive today, but also millions of individuals affected by these comorbidities in the typical population. The
importance of this fact has been acknowledged by NIH through the launching of the INCLUDE (INvestigation of
Co-occurring conditions across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE) Project.
Within this framework, the INCLUDE Project has recognized the strategic importance of a large cohort study of
individuals with DS to accelerate research in this area, with the goal of enabling a precision medicine approach
to DS via novel diagnostics and therapeutic tools. Therefore, the mission of this DCC team is to create a world-
class resource and associated platforms for empowered data sharing, data access, and integrative analysis that
will enable novel investigations into all DS comorbidities across the lifespan. To achieve this goal, the proposed
DCC will create a real-time, integrated data ecosystem that will catalyze innovation, collaboration, and
transformative discoveries by engaging and empowering a diverse community of stakeholders to drive
collaborative, accelerated discovery on behalf of transformative action and impact from bench to bedside and
beyond. Altogether, the efforts underpinning the proposed efforts will serve first and foremost people with DS
by accelerating research into DS comorbidities, but will also elevate our understanding of human biology across
diverse scientific disciplines."

malignancies while strongly predisposing them to Alzheimer’s disease, congenital heart disease, leukemias,
autoimmune disorders, and diverse neurological conditions. However, little is known about the mechanisms
underlying this differential clinical profile or the relationship between these conditions in the context of DS versus
when occurring in the general population. Moreover, individuals with DS display a large degree of phenotypic
variation suggesting the existence of modulating factors that affect how T21 manifests at the individual level,
including genetic variation, epigenetic modifiers, varying endotypes modulating the transcriptome, proteome and
metabolome, lifestyle and environmental factors, or even perhaps the microbiome. Therefore, elucidating the
mechanisms driving and modulating DS comorbidities will serve not only the six million people worldwide with
DS alive today, but also millions of individuals affected by these comorbidities in the typical population. The
importance of this fact has been acknowledged by NIH through the launching of the INCLUDE (INvestigation of
Co-occurring conditions across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE) Project.
Within this framework, the INCLUDE Project has recognized the strategic importance of a large cohort study of
individuals with DS to accelerate research in this area, with the goal of enabling a precision medicine approach
to DS via novel diagnostics and therapeutic tools. Therefore, the mission of this DCC team is to create a world-
class resource and associated platforms for empowered data sharing, data access, and integrative analysis that
will enable novel investigations into all DS comorbidities across the lifespan. To achieve this goal, the proposed
DCC will create a real-time, integrated data ecosystem that will catalyze innovation, collaboration, and
transformative discoveries by engaging and empowering a diverse community of stakeholders to drive
collaborative, accelerated discovery on behalf of transformative action and impact from bench to bedside and
beyond. Altogether, the efforts underpinning the proposed efforts will serve first and foremost people with DS
by accelerating research into DS comorbidities, but will also elevate our understanding of human biology across
diverse scientific disciplines."

Roxana Chicas, PhD, RN is a 1st generation bilingual Latina and her goal is to become an independent NIH-
funded nurse scientist developing a sustainable research program in the area of
glucose metabolism and
kidney disease. Support from the K23 award will provide the dedicated research time that will enable
fundamental training and mentorship to further her understanding of: 1) the relationship of
glucose metabolic
pathways and heat exposure and the development of
kidney disease in farmworkers using a metabolomics
approach; and 2) the design and management of community-engaged intervention trials to decrease the risk of
heat stress, renal dysfunction, and glucose dysregulation in vulnerable populations. Heat is the leading cause
of weather-related deaths in the US, and farmworkers comprise an occupational sector particularly vulnerable
to heat-related illness (HRI). Between 2-3 million workers in the US agricultural industry are at risk of heat
related mortality at a rate that is 35 times greater than that of the general workforce population. In the last
decade a number of investigations have shown a link between heat exposure and the risk of acute kidney
injury (AKI). The chronic effects of the insidious and unexplained uptick of AKI among farmworkers, and the
disproportionate burden of HRI and repetitive heat stress-induced dehydration are not well understood. The
role that predisposing health conditions such as prediabetes may play in the risk of AKI has not been
examined. While studies have documented heat-related risk factors and the body’s physiologic response to
heat, few investigations have considered whether glucose metabolism and high environmental heat conditions
are a risk factor for acute kidney injury, and less is known about the metabolic pathways underlying the body’s
response to heat stress. The goal of this project is to characterize the physiologic phenotypes of farmworkers
across seasons and exposures (indoors v. outdoors), using non-targeted, high-resolution metabolomics (HRM)
to compare metabolomic profiles, and examine the associations between HRI clinical profiles (including core
body temperature, heart rate, dehydration, HRI symptoms); inflammation biomarkers (IL-10, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β,
TNF-α, HSP72, HSP90); renal biomarkers (serum creatinine, BUN, eGFR, proteinuria, uric acid; aldosterone,
and copeptin); and glucose clinical profiles (HbA1c, AM fasting blood glucose, and PM blood glucose levels).
This proposed study will explore interplay of glucose metabolism and HRI and advance our understanding of
the physiologic underpinnings of AKI and renal function. The incorporation of metabolomic profiles will add to
the state of the science by indicating the underlying metabolic mechanisms and consequences of the
physiologic response to heat stress."

Human lung function is determined by a complex combination of both genetic and
environmental factors. Climate change is an environmental factor with the potential to affect
lung health on a large scale. While transient changes in local weather have been associated
with increased rates of asthma and COPD exacerbations, less is known about the effects of
climate on long-term respiratory outcomes. A prior retrospective cross-sectional study has
shown that warmer ambient air temperatures are associated with lower lung function in a
general healthy U.S. population (NHANES), which may have implications given climate change.
The primary goal of our proposal is to identify associations between changes in lung function
and climate over time by analyzing data from the U.S. Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Foundation Patient
Registry, which includes longitudinal data from over 30,000 individuals with CF receiving care at
accredited CF centers in the U.S. We are utilizing CF as a model as warmer temperatures have
been associated with lower lung function in 3 separate populations of individuals with CF in the
U.S. and Australia, again through retrospective cross-sectional studies. Additionally, dense
demographic and clinical information is collected routinely every three months for the entire
lifetime of people with CF, which will facilitate this unique longitudinal study. In addition to
testing whether temperature changes are associated with changes in lung function, we also plan
to assess the roles of respiratory pathogens and socioeconomic factors in this relationship as
well. Our methods include several different modeling approaches to account for subject mobility
over time, non-linear temperature changes, CFTR modulator therapies, and time-varying
confounders. We will also test approaches for interaction models (socioeconomic factors) and
mediation models (respiratory pathogens). Completion of this research will provide information
on the potential effects of climate change on long-term respiratory outcomes with relevance to
respiratory morbidities and mortality as well as inform analytic techniques for future climate
change studies of longitudinal outcomes. Understanding the effect of climate change on
longitudinal outcomes is essential in quantifying the burden of disease imposed by climate
change."
10879392,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (Allo-HCT) is a curative therapy for patients with hematological
malignancies (i.e. leukemia and lymphoma), through graft versus leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) effect mediated
by alloreactive donor T cells. However, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) caused by the same alloreactive T
cells remains a major obstacle. Chronic GVHD (cGVHD), a systemic autoimmune-like syndrome, remains a
major cause of morbidity and mortality in long-term survivors of Allo-HCT. During the past decade, we have
used murine and humanized murine models of cGVHD and biospecimens from cGVHD patients to
demonstrate that CD4+ T cells and B cells and their interactions in GVHD target tissues such as the liver, lung
and skin play a critical role in the pathogenesis and persistence of the disease. The premise of this new
proposal is that deeper mechanistic understanding of the interactions between non-circulating tissue-
resident CD4+ memory T (Trm) and tissue-resident B (Brm) cells in GVHD target tissues will identify
new therapeutic targets for prevention or treatment of cGVHD. In Aim 1, we will determine whether CD4+
Trm cells initiate formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) in GVHD target tissues, in which Ly108+ stem
cell-like progenitors maintain the pool of Trm and Brm to perpetuate cGVHD pathogenesis. We will also
develop novel cell-penetrating PS-Cas9-gRNA to target STAT3 in donor T cells to prevent development of
pathogenic CD4+ Trm and cGVHD while preserving GVL activity, because our recent studies indicate that
STAT3 is required for Trm development. In Aim 2, we will determine whether B cell helper PD-1hiPSGL1loCD4+
Trh cells interact with T-bet+ Brm cells to produce autoantibodies that augment systemic tissue damage. In
Aim 3, we will determine whether non-B cell helper PSGL1hiCD4+ Trm cells interact with dendritic cells,
macrophages, and fibroblasts in cGVHD target tissues to mediate damage and fibrosis in an IL-33/ST2
pathway-dependent manner. These studies have high biological and translational significance and may lead to
a paradigm shift in our understanding of cGVHD pathogenesis and to development of novel approaches for
preventing and treating cGVHD."

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries impact more than 250,000 people in the U.S. annually. Sex is a major
risk factor for ACL injury during adolescence, but not in childhood or adulthood. To explain the increased injury
risk for females, several modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors have been explored. Very few of these studies
examine the impact on the ACL tissue itself, which in turn, can impact injury risk or the need for patient-specific
treatment. The long-term goal of our work is to explore mechanisms by which sex and skeletal growth impact
ACL structure, function, injury risk, and treatment. Our prior work has established sex- and region-specific
differences in function and cross-sectional area (CSA) within its anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL)
bundles. These differences appear around early adolescence and persist as adolescence progresses. Yet, the
mechanism driving such sex-specific tissue adaptations is unclear. Earlier initiation of puberty has been
associated with greater cumulative estrogen exposure, which may influence ACL bundle function. Additionally,
ACL injury risk varies during the menstrual cycle in humans, but the presence of corresponding changes in ACL
bundle size and function is unknown. Additionally, a direct relationship between temporal hormone levels and
ACL size and function has not been established. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to determine how sex
hormones impact ACL bundle size and function. To accomplish this objective, we will leverage our multi-
disciplinary experience to accomplish the following aims. Aim 1 examines effect of puberty onset on long-term
ACL bundle size and function. In Aim 1a, we will assess how timing of natural puberty onset influences long-
term ACL bundle size and function throughout adolescence. In Aim 1b, we will assess whether early induction
of puberty and rise in estrogen further alters ACL bundle size and function throughout adolescence. Aim 2
examines the effect of cyclic hormone levels on short-term ACL bundle size and function. In Aim 2a, we will
assess how cyclic sex hormone levels influence ACL bundle size and function throughout the normal estrus
cycle. In Aim 2b, we will assess whether stabilization of hormone levels reduces cyclic changes in ACL bundle
size and function. If successful, this proposal will establish a clear and direct link between natural changes in
sex hormones during adolescence and ACL size or function. Ultimately, the information gained can suggest
promising human clinical trials of injury risk reduction and new potential treatment strategies."

 We propose a 5-year renewal of our African Ancestry-Genomic Psychiatry Cohort (AA-GPC) R01-
MH104964. AA and other minority populations have been poorly represented in large-scale genomic studies,
and yet these populations (i) have the largest disparities in health care and outcomes, and (ii) have the
potential to broaden our knowledge of human genetics. In particular, AA genomes have nearly a million more
variants per individual and are characterized by shorter haplotype blocks than European ancestry (EA)
populations. As a consequence, genetic polymorphisms that are in perfect linkage disequilibrium (LD) in
Europeans are broken-up by recombination events in AA genomes, allowing the contributions of smaller
genomic intervals comprised of fewer variants to be assessed independently.
 Progress to date: During the initial funding period we will have enrolled and assessed ~10,000 new AA
participants and have already completed 8,000 AA whole genome sequences (WGS). We recently
demonstrated that among the 128 associated SNPs identified in the PGC-2 schizophrenia analysis, 41
increased in significance when combined with data from 10,000 AA-GPC participants, and for 12 of these
regions, there was a reduction in the number of SNPs in the associated interval. In addition, this trans-ancestry
meta-analysis of PGC-2 schizophrenia and AA-GPC results yielded 10 newly genome-wide significant loci.
Similarly, the trans-ancestry meta-analysis results yielded the best polygenic risk score “training” dataset,
explaining more variance in individuals of European and African ancestry, than scores based on either
ancestry alone.
 In Phase 1 of this renewal: we will study genome-wide common variation in our existing AA-GPC and
VA-CS#572 combined cohort of 36,322 AA participants. In Phase 2, we will perform an expanded analysis by
adding 5,000 new participants ascertained in this project, 27,500 additional controls from the VA, and 34,000
cases and controls from the NeuroGap-Psychosis study (NeuroPsychiatric Genetics in African Populations;
PI. Koenen). This meta-analysis will include over 100,000 AA participants, a sample of non-Caucasians with
the potential for significant novel discovery."
