Fc receptors (FcRs) are cell surface proteins that interact with antibody Fc domains to mediate effector cell
responses that contribute to the antiviral functionality of antibodies. The diversity of antibodies (isotypes,
subclasses, allotypes) and FcRs (types, gene polymorphisms, isoforms) influences antiviral antibody effector
functions by modulating the interactions between antigen–antibody immune complexes and FcRs. However,
the relative combined contributions of these key variables to protective outcomes in human and rhesus
macaque (RM) active and passive immunization studies are unknown. Thus, there is a critical need to
characterize how different antibody isotypes, subclasses, allotypes, and FcR alleles impact species-specific
FcR-dependent antibody effector functions in order to understand how immunoprophylaxis trials conducted in
the RM model can predict outcomes in humans. The overall goal of the Physical Resources Core is to develop
and provide this Program with the tools, reagents, samples, and nucleic acid sequence datasets and analyses
needed for translation of FcR and antibody Fc genetic diversity among humans and RM to phenotypes,
effector functions, and study outcomes. To achieve this, the Physical Resources Core brings together an
innovative team of investigators with extensive experience and expertise in the generation, validation, and
analysis of next-generation sequencing data; and in the development, production, validation, distribution, and
application of novel immunology reagents and materials that are not commercially available. Guided by strong
preliminary data, and using a combination of gold-standard and state-of-the art approaches, the Physical
Resources Core will achieve the objective of supporting Research Projects 1, 2, 3 and the Overall Program
through focus on completion of three Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Quantify human FcR diversity in HIV-1 clinical trial participants.
Aim 2. Define antibody Fc allotype diversity in humans and RM.
Aim 3. Provide immunology reagents and services.
Fulfillment of the aims of the Core will be significant and impactful because it will lead to identification of the
combinations of nAb and nnAb and effector cell biology for improved understanding of in situ functions. This
will provide a roadmap to improve testing accuracy and evaluations of both future active, and
immunoprophylaxis, vaccine candidates in human clinical trials. The Physical Resources Core will help
generate knowledge essential to accomplishing the Overall Goal of this Program: to determine the impact of
antibody allotype and FcR genotype on antiviral outcomes in vitro and in vivo, thus informing how antibody Fc
effector functions can be used to improve antibody-based vaccine strategies, increase the relative antiviral
activity of HIV-1 specific antibody subclasses, and augment broad-neutralizing antibody-based prophylactic
and therapeutic approaches."

Microglia are innate immune cells of the central nervous system, which interact with neurons in the adult brain.
Microglial receptors and pathways have a demonstrated ability to alter complex network function. This process
begins with microglia sensing specific neuronal signals. However, the downstream mechanisms used by
microglia to enact specific responses/outcomes is not well understood. The purpose of this research is to
understand how microglia sense neuronal activity during hyperactivity (e.g., seizures) and hypoactivity (e.g.,
anesthesia), which may then trigger unique functional responses to alter neuronal circuits in the adult brain. ATP
purine signaling during hyperactivity is a well-documented signal for microglia to interact with neurons in seizure,
reducing seizure severity. However, the complexity of microglial intracellular (secondary messenger such as
Ca2+ signaling) responses to ATP is only partially understood. Unique intracellular signaling cascades in
microglia may differentially influence their functional responses. These pathways will be interrogated using acute
brain slice and in vivo two-photon imaging along with a suite of new genetic and virus-based tools to uncover
how the calcium pathway of microglia in particular informs seizure responses. During hypoactivity, a loss of
norepinephrine signaling allows microglia to better interact with neurons under anesthesia. The purpose of these
interactions for network function is unknown, but will be dissected using in vivo two-photon imaging of microglia-
neuron dynamics in the intact brain, coupled with 3D-electron microscope reconstruction of highly detailed
structural interactions. Previous experience using chemogenetic and conditional knockout approaches to alter
microglia function are also utilized to dissect specific pathways regulating hypoactive neural circuit responses.
Ultimately, determining how microglia regulate neuronal function, including underlying mechanisms and their
impact on circuitry, is essential to fully understand how microglia are integrated into the complex neuronal circuits
as they become dysregulated in brain diseases, such as seizures and sleep disorders."

Genome-scale genetic screens performed using CRISPR-Cas9 editing can interrogate determinants
of cell viability and are powerful tools for the identification of genetic regulators. Using this technology,
hundreds of millions of cells - each targeted with a specific genetic alteration - can be surveyed,
typically based on a live/dead survival profiling. Phenotype-based genetic screens - where protein
expression alterations are detected - represent a next-generation approach and can facilitate the
identification of regulators of therapeutically-relevant proteoforms. Due to challenges related to
implementation, phenotype-based screens are less commonly used compared to proliferation-based
screens. Thus, rapid and robust selection approaches for targeted capture of live cells are required to
realize the potential of phenotypic genome-scale screens for functional discovery, further annotation
of the human genome, and discovery of novel targets for the development of therapeutics.
Recently, through the use of a newly developed high-throughput approach for phenotypic CRISPR-
Cas9 screening (Microfluidic Immunomagnetic Cell Sorting (MICS)) we processed an entire genome-
wide screen containing more than 108 cells in under one hour to study factors that modulate the
display of CD47 on the cell surface. This highly scalable cell sorting technology maintained high
levels of cell viability throughout the screening process. CD47 is a widely expressed cell surface
protein that acts as a “don’t eat me” signal through inhibitory interactions with SIRPa, a protein
expressed on macrophages and other myeloid cells that negatively regulates phagocytosis. CD47 is
highly expressed on various tumour types and blocking the CD47-SIRPa interaction has been
explored as a novel cancer immunotherapy strategy that has shown promising results for some
cancer types. We robustly identified modulators of CD47 function including QPCTL, an enzyme
required for formation of the pyroglutamyl modification at the N-terminus of CD47 and interaction with
SIRPa.
The proposed study will expand the utility of the platform, develop new classes of microfluidic chips
for cytometric analysis, and produce a comprehensive database of geno/phenotypic relationships.
This new high-performance phenotypic assessment system will greatly accelerate target discovery
for cancer therapeutics. In this project we will specifically interrogate VISTA (V-domain
immunoglobulin (Ig)-containing suppressor of T-cell activation) and cGAS/STING signaling pathways
using a series of related cell lines to identify novel targets for immunotherapies. Importantly, these
data will demonstrate the utility of the technology for rapid assessment of regulatory networks for
drug discovery."
10885106,"Project Summary
 Environmental exposures play a leading role in the development of human disease and are therefore of
significant interest, but measuring the myriad of environmental exposures encountered over a lifetime is an
immense challenge. Even more complicated is identifying the molecular pathways disrupted by each
environmental exposure encountered. Yet, progress on both of these challenges is ultimately fundamental to
understanding the contribution of the environment to human health. The overarching mission of my research
program is to address this critical need by developing and applying novel metabolomic technologies.
 Metabolomics is a relatively new analytical approach that is ideally suited to help address these formidable
challenges because it comprehensively profiles small molecules of both exogenous and endogenous origin. In
practice, however, metabolomics has not fulfilled its potential in the environmental health sciences. Its
application has been severely limited due to the tens of thousands of signals detected by liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) that cannot be identified. Without biochemically naming the
metabolomic signals, biological inference is compromised and insights into exposure chemicals or effect
mechanisms are prevented. The major goal of my research program is to overcome this barrier in
metabolomics to (1) enable unprecedented exposure analysis in humans and (2) to discover toxicant effect
mechanisms by using zebrafish.
 First, with new technologies that my laboratory has developed, we will name each signal detected by
LC/MS untargeted metabolomics from human blood and the zebrafish embryo. This will constitute the human
and zebrafish “reference metabolomes”. We will then develop a resource to automate identification and
quantitation of each metabolite in the reference metabolomes. Second, we will screen the zebrafish reference
metabolome to identify effect mechanisms of specific toxicants known to have adverse effects on only a single
zebrafish organ. We will test our hypothesis that each organ’s metabolism is similarly disrupted by some
toxicants, but that their unique phenotypic responses reflect organ-specific sensitivities to particular pathways.
Thus, in addition to building a metabolomics resource that will greatly enhance exposure analysis in human
subjects, we also expect that the application of our platform to zebrafish will identify toxicant effect
mechanisms and establish biochemical pathways that contribute to particular phenotypes."
10894200,"With the advent of precision oncology, including both small molecule inhibitors targeting specific genetic drivers of
cancer and modulators of the immune response to cancer neoantigens, there is a pressing need for advanced diagnostics to
direct and monitor therapeutic interventions. Currently, such real time monitoring is performed through repeat, or
resistance, biopsies; however, these surgical biopsies are invasive, may have significant complications including
insufficient tissue for the intended analyses, and only sample one specific site of tumor, which may not be representative
of the entire tumor cell population within a patient. Liquid biopsies are poised to revolutionize cancer therapies, by
enabling frequent blood-based monitoring of tumor-derived materials, as cancers evolve in response to therapeutic
interventions. The technological hurdle in isolating sufficient numbers of rare CTCs from routine blood specimens has
been the single major limitation preventing the clinical deployment of CTC-based diagnostic opportunities. Enabled by
the technology proposed here, our shift from processing routine 10 mL blood tubes (0.2% of whole blood volume) to
making use of clinical leukapheresis to sample near-whole blood volumes (40-100%) addresses this challenge. The
fundamental basis of the technology is the highly efficient depletion of antibody-tagged blood cells away from
unmanipulated CTCs (“negative depletion” as opposed to “positive selection”), thereby enabling tumor antigen–
independent enrichment of unperturbed, viable CTCs. This strategy is applicable to cells disseminated from virtually any
solid tumor type without making any a priori assumption on the physical or biological properties of tumor cells. Our
hypothesis is that liquid biopsy of large number of CTCs using leukopheresis is equivalent to the invasive biopsies
of metastatic tumor lesions, currently performed at the time of on-treatment disease progression in lung cancer.
To address our hypothesis, we formulated 3 Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a large-volume CTC isolation technology
based on microfluidic negative selection. In Aim 2, we will integrate microfluidic components designed in Aim 1 into a
monolithic chip for sorting of CTCs from leukopaks. In Aim 3, we will test our hypothesis by a direct comparison of
tumor biopsy and liquid biopsy, performed within a few weeks of each other, assessing both their success rate and
diagnostic accuracy. We believe that the convergence of resources and multidisciplinary expertise available in our team
will lead to a transformative bioengineering technology, paired with a highly clinically-relevant clinical challenge,
providing a new tool for preclinical lung cancer therapeutics. A positive outcome in this pilot study would set the stage for
testing more complex clinical applications, ranging from measuring cancer cell signaling effects of drug therapy
(“noninvasive pharmacokinetics”) and quantitation of cell surface protein targets for cancer immunotherapy (protein-
based predictive markers), and ultimately even enable detection and tissue localization of early invasive cancers in at-risk
individuals such as familial breast cancer, people with environmental risks (e.g., lung nodules in smokers, liver cancer in
cirrhosis), abnormal radiographic findings of unknown significance or inaccessible biopsy."
10893432,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Androgens are well known to be immunosuppressive, yet cancer immunotherapy is used without consideration
of local androgen concentrations or the sex of the patient. We present evidence that targeting the androgen
receptor is necessary for effective T cell-specific immunotherapy in mouse models of prostate cancer and
sarcoma and in a human clinical trial of metastatic prostate cancer. In patient biopsies, we observed a striking
correlation between low androgen receptor activity in CD8 T cells and response to PD-1 targeted
immunotherapy. We validated our observations in a novel mouse model of castration resistant prostate cancer
and demonstrated a requirement for androgen receptor inhibition to permit effective PD-L1 immunotherapy.
Moreover, tumor regression required CD8 T cells suggesting T cell intrinsic AR activity could regulate response
to immunotherapy. Extending these studies, we isolated activated CD8 T cells and observed a strong association
of androgen receptor with chromatin modifiers. Performing in silico experiments revealed canonical androgen
response elements in open chromatin regions of the Ifng and Gzmb loci. We observed binding of the androgen
receptor within these regions and importantly, the ability to inhibit this interaction with a small molecule inhibitor.
Inhibiting this interaction increased the functional capacity of dysfunctional CD8 T cells; a functional state further
amplified by PD-L1 blockade. Taken together, these observations suggest that androgen receptor signaling
could enforce the dysfunctional chromatin state of T cells limiting reinvigoration by checkpoint blockade. To the
best of our knowledge this is the first experimental model to establish a direct role for androgen receptor
activity on regulating responsiveness to immunotherapy.
The goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanism(s) by which androgen receptor activity in CD8 T cells
limits the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy. We hypothesize that androgen receptor activity in CD8 T
cells limits functional re-invigoration to immune checkpoint blockade by transcriptional and epigenetic
repression of effector genes. We will test this hypothesis in the following Aims. 1) Evaluate whether AR activity
represses T cell effector genes by direct DNA binding; 2) Determine whether AR signaling enforces a repressive
chromatin state in dysfunctional CD8 T cells; and 3) Determine whether loss of T cell intrinsic AR is sufficient to
restore responsiveness to checkpoint blockade.
Together, these studies provide a framework for understanding hormone mediated resistance to cancer
immunotherapy. Importantly, we will gain a critical understanding of how androgen could limit effective
immunotherapy in prostate cancer patients and anticipate that our observations will be applicable beyond this
disease to improve immunotherapy outcomes in cancers where androgens are present."

The UAB P30 Research and Translation Core Center consolidates a large number of externally funded cystic
fibrosis (CF) research programs on our campus, building an innovative environment to pursue, advance, and
train in CF-related science. During the last funding period, the P30 made robust and important contributions to
multiple UAB laboratories of our Research Base of over 70 investigators pursuing research relevant to CFTR
modulation; CF pathogenesis; novel outcome measures for the genetic therapy era; infection and inflammation
in the context of highly effective modulator therapy; and therapeutic translation for untreated CFTR mutations.
By virtue of the NIH Center, translational research at our Institution has continued to accelerate in the past five
years, as has the breadth of investigators. The richness of CF basic science at UAB has grown in parallel with
this translational expansion, providing numerous opportunities to exploit in the next funding period, and the
Center is strategically structured to take advantage of these opportunities.
The P30 Center has allowed investigators at UAB and collaborating sites to improve understanding of CF
disease mechanism and has furnished novel opportunities to aggressively apply this information towards
experimental therapeutics, including genetic-based therapies that will continue to grow in emphasis. This NIH
Center includes three Biomedical Research Cores that help to organize efforts of CF faculty towards the
common and essential goal of helping individuals with CF and to train the next generation of CF leaders. The
Cores include: Core A: Cell Model and Assay Core (GM Solomon and J Guimbellot, Co-PIs); Core B: Animal
Models Core (DM Bedwell and S Birket, Co-PIs); and Core C: Clinical and Translational Core (SM Rowe and A
Gaggar, Co-PIs). Each Core provides leading-edge assays, specialized reagents and techniques, and valued
expertise. The P30 has also engaged new investigators through a Pilot and Feasibility mechanism integral to
Center vitality and has a tight integration with the UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Science, enabling a
robust training environment. In addition to providing a platform from which junior and senior scientists are
brought into the field, Pilot Projects serve as a means of rapidly testing exciting advances, particularly from the
perspective of clinical translation. Two Pilot and Feasibility Projects are in progress: Project 1: R Patel, PI.
“Erythrocyte Hemolysis and Lung Disease in CF”; and Project 2: E Plaisance, PI. “Ketone Monoester
Supplementation in CF: A Pilot and Feasibility Study”, capitalizing on the next era of innovative opportunities to
transform the disease. Through these scientific initiatives, the P30 has added value to a collaborative
environment for CF research at our Institution, and is well-positioned to continue in this capacity in the future,
with a major focus on therapeutic translation."
10894888,"The overall goal of the proposed research is to optimize colorectal cancer (CRC) screening strategies for
individuals at the highest risk for CRC development attributable to Lynch Syndrome (LS). Germline alterations
in one of four DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes causes LS, an autosomal dominant condition associated with
multiple malignancies and the most common inherited CRC syndrome. LS affects nearly 1/300 individuals and
~1 million individuals in the US, similar to BRCA-related hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.
Current CRC surveillance recommendations for LS involve colonoscopy every 1-2 years starting at age 25 years;
in their lifetime, individuals with LS will have completed ~50 colonoscopies (vs. 3 for average-risk screening).
This intensive strategy is based on inflated lifetime CRC risk estimates and do not account for variable risk based
on genotype. As a result, the current “one-size-fits-all” approach to CRC surveillance in LS individuals
with the less aggressive genotypes subjects them to over-testing and overtreatment, with a negative
impact on quality of life and significant resource utilization. The overarching hypothesis of our proposal is
that CRC surveillance in LS should be tailored to the risk of CRC incidence and mortality associated with each
genotype to improve individual health outcomes, resource utilization, and acceptability to providers and patients
alike. The hypothesis will be tested with three aims:
Aim 1: Determine the optimal gene-specific colonoscopy regimen in LS and estimate the improved
resource utilization (colonoscopy demand) with a personalized LS surveillance approach. Using
simulation modeling, we will refine the LS-CRC model to project the long-term outcomes for numerous strategies
for each of the four MMR genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) with varying (a) surveillance intervals. This
will allow us to estimate the number of colonoscopies with current and various regimens evaluated.
Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of incorporating non-invasive CRC screening modalities, such as stool
studies (fecal immunohistochemical testing (FIT) and FIT-fecal DNA) to colonoscopy surveillance for LS
carriers. We will use our model to evaluate a novel, hybrid approach to CRC surveillance that will incorporate
non-invasive approaches to colonoscopy to minimize overutilization of colonoscopy, potentially improving
outcomes by increasing adherence and saving costs.
Aim 3: Assess barriers, facilitators, and attitudes towards current and new, personalized, gene-specific
CRC surveillance strategies. We will assess attitudes towards colonoscopy with or without non-invasive CRC
screening tests among healthcare providers and patients.
Impact: By award period end, we will have produced personalized risk-tailored CRC surveillance regimens with
LS that optimize effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Results of this proposal will provide evidence to support
the de-implementation of colonoscopy overuse in LS."
10897946,"Abstract
 The occurrence of CRC in the United States shows a large disparity among recognized races and
ethnicities, with African Americans demonstrating the highest incidence and mortality from this disease. We
have observed a novel “loss of function” phenotype for the DNA mismatch repair protein MSH3 that is induced
by pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL6) to shuttle MSH3 from the nucleus (where it normally repairs DNA
microsatellites and double strand breaks) to the cytosol, where it no longer can repair DNA with coincident
accumulation of tetranucleotide microsatellite frameshifts (termed EMAST, elevated microsatellite alterations at
selected tetranucleotide repeats). These inflammation-associated microsatellite alterations are observed in
50% of all sporadic CRCs and is associated with advance-staged disease and poor patient survival. This
inflammation-induced somatic MSH3 defect is observed in twice as many African American than Caucasian
rectal cancers, and is associated with poor patient outcome. In this proposal, we hypothesize that MSH3
disruption contributes to the consequence of advanced stage and poor survival in African American CRC
patients. Our preliminary data demonstrates clear evidence that MSH3 participates in Homologous
Recombination repair of DNA double strand breaks as well as prevents aneuploidy. We have identified 6
unique somatic deleterious MSH3 mutations among African American CRCs that have not been reported in
public databases. And we have characterized that chromosome 9p24.2 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is
associated with EMAST, and dramatically modifies survival of patients whose primary CRC demonstrates
EMAST and 9p24.2 LOH. In this proposal, we will examine the central role of MSH3 dysfunction in its
contribution to the survival outcome of African American CRC patients. Our aim is to assess the role of MSH3-
disrupted double strand break mis-repair among African American CRCs, determine the functionality of 6
unique MSH3 mutations observed in African American CRCs, and ascertain the contribution of MSH3-
deficiency with chromosome 9p24.2 LOH in the aggressiveness of African American CRCs. Overall, this
proposal examines the role and contribution of defective MSH3 protein that likely contributes to the poor
phenotype associated with African American CRC patients."

 Preemptive pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing may be particularly beneficial in medically underserved
populations by reducing the number of appointments required to optimize drug therapy and increasing the
effectiveness of less expensive off-patent medications – the type most often with pharmacogenetic guidelines
available (PGx drugs). However, there is little data available to guide clinical implementation in these patient
populations. Our long-term goal is to contribute toward the efficient implementation of PGx into clinical
practice to improve the precision of medication prescribing. The overall objective for this application is to
identify PGx drug usage patterns in medically underserved patients, and assess the feasibility and
effectiveness of preemptive PGx testing in this patient population. The central hypothesis is that medically
underserved patients are prescribed more PGx drugs, and preemptive PGx testing is feasible as well as
effective in improving patient medication satisfaction. The rationale for the proposed research is that
identifying patient populations that can most benefit from PGx testing will facilitate clinical implementation that
may reduce medication treatment disparities.
 We plan to test the central hypothesis and accomplish the overall objective of this application by pursuing
three specific aims. The first aim is to identify clinical, demographic and socioeconomic factors associated
with PGx drug prescribing patterns in a large, real-world, diverse patient population. We will accomplish this
aim by comparing clinical, demographic, and socioeconomic data with prescription data from millions of
patients across the State of Florida. The second aim is to develop a low-cost, ancestrally inclusive PGx testing
panel designed to inform commonly used PGx drugs. We will design a low-cost, clinically validated panel that
will include variants common in racial minorities in the U.S. We plan to leverage extensive batching of tests
and an already available genotyping platform that minimizes labor costs in order to achieve significant cost
savings. The third aim is to determine the feasibility of low-cost preemptive PGx testing in a medically
underserved population as well as its effect on patient medication satisfaction. We will accomplish this aim by
completing a randomized open-label clinical trial comparing medically underserved patients receiving
preemptive PGx testing to those receiving usual care. We will compare key implementation metrics and will
also conduct semi-structured interviews in both patients and healthcare providers to assess PGx perceptions
of feasibility and sustainability from stakeholders.
 The proposed research is significant because it should contribute valuable preliminary data toward both
the real-world effectiveness of preemptive PGx testing as well as the feasibility of studying and implementing
this technology in medically underserved patients – an area of PGx research where few data are available. The
proposed research is innovative because this project will utilize additional demographic and socioeconomic
data that, with along with clinical data, should better identify patient populations most likely to benefit from PGx
testing and allow focused of implementation efforts to those populations. Ultimately, we expect to have
developed valuable data identifying patients most likely to benefit from preemptive PGx testing, particularly in
patients who are medically underserved and/or members of racial minorities. These results should have an
important positive impact because they can inform further clinical implementation efforts of PGx as well as
future large clinical trials of preemptive testing, ideally reducing healthcare disparities in the field of precision
medicine."

Project Summary: Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection (Sepsis-
3 definition), is the leading cause of death and most expensive condition in hospitals. Annually, > 30 million people affected
worldwide, with at least 1.7 million adults developing sepsis (nearly 270K die) at a cost of $24 billion per year in the U.S.
Patients diagnosed with sepsis and no ongoing sign of organ failure have about a 15-30% chance of death. However, the
mortality rate can increase up to 40-60% for severe sepsis or septic shock patients. One in three patients who die in a hospital
have sepsis. One major factor in these rising mortality rates is the inability to accurately and quickly diagnose potentially
septic patients. Likewise, sepsis is a leading cause of hospital readmission (higher proportion than hospitalizations for heart
attack, heart failure, COPD, and pneumonia in the U.S.). EDs and ICUs rely on monitoring extremely non-specific
parameters (e.g. fever, low blood pressure, increased heart rate) to initiate a clinical diagnosis and begin treatment. These
crude indicators cause doctors to mistake early stage sepsis with several other diseases. A positive diagnose of early onset
sepsis is critical because mortality increases with delays in treatment. Survival rates have been reported to drop by 7.6%
every hour that the proper antibiotics are not administered, and these delays compound unnecessary hospital costs. Over the
last 30 years, clinics have used different criteria such as SIRS, LODS and SOFA or qSOFA as screening tools to assess the
severity of organ dysfunction in a potentially septic patient. Common factors among these criteria are non-specificity and
very high false positive rates. For patients with positive criteria, the final diagnostic test is a blood culture that may take up
to 5 day for a negative result. Likewise, blood culture has a very high false negative rate (> 60%) and does not work for
fastidious pathogens such as Chlamydia pneumoniae. More importantly, blood culture cannot be a gold standard method
for sepsis diagnosis. This technique only detects the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream (bacteremia), which does not
necessarily indicate illness. Many non-bacteremic infections can also cause life-threatening sepsis. In order to improve the
accuracy and sensitivity of sepsis diagnosis, the Sepsis-3 definition underscores the requirements for both pathogen
detection and information about the personalized state of the immune system of the patient. Therefore, we propose to focus
our efforts on monitoring selective biomarkers of this immune response. However, no single, or even a combination of
biomarkers has been validated for the diagnosis of sepsis. Because no single biomarker is specific enough to predict sepsis,
we propose to develop a point-of-care microfluidic biochip for measuring cell-surface and plasma-proteins biomarkers that
will be used for contributing in early sepsis diagnosis. The microfluidic biochip will provide a complete white blood cell
count (WBC), as well as quantification of CD64 expression on neutrophil (nCD64), procalcitonin (PCT), C-Reactive Protein
(CRP) and Interleukin 6 (IL-6). Multiple studies have demonstrated the high sensitivity of these biomarkers to sepsis. The
proposed device will combine for the first time the analysis of cell-surface proteins and plasma proteins biomarkers from
the same sample of blood. Such a device, combined with the routinely test performed in the hospitals, could significantly
accelerate the diagnosis of sepsis and as consequence the clinical decision, to provide the correct treatment to the patients."

The Addressing Rural cancer Inequities through Scientific Excellence (ARISE) program aims to provide
transdisciplinary and translational postdoctoral research training in rural cancer prevention, control, and
survivorship. To achieve health equity and reduce the highest cancer morbidity and mortality rates in the
nation, University of Kentucky’s (UK) behavioral cancer training efforts must develop a new generation of
collaborative and rigorous scientists. Led by two well-established cancer and health equity researchers with
extensive track records of training, ARISE will meet this critical need by providing multifaceted training
opportunities to well-qualified postdoctoral scholars in applied behavioral science, including intervention and
dissemination and implementation science. Training will emphasize translating knowledge of risk factors into
evidence-based behavioral interventions across the cancer spectrum (prevention to survivorship) for
vulnerable rural residents. ARISE postdoctoral trainees will select one of three thematic behavioral cancer
tracks: environment, risk behavior, and health care delivery. We will recruit two trainees, each year for a two-
year fellowship. The training program, based in the Center for Health Equity Transformation, will operate in
close collaboration with UK’s National Cancer Institute-designated Markey Cancer Center; Center for Clinical
and Translational Science; Center for Appalachian Research in Environmental Sciences; Office of Postdoctoral
Affairs; Office of the Vice President for Research and departments across UK’s 16 colleges. The 25
preceptors, co-mentors and methodology mentors include well-funded investigators in transdisciplinary
research with established collaborative relationships, representing diverse yet complementary areas of
expertise, including behavioral science; environmental carcinogenesis; clinical and translational research; and
intervention and implementation science. Additional mentoring includes geospatial analysis, mHealth and
cluster randomized designs. Each trainee will have a mentoring committee with one primary mentor in her/his
specified track and two secondary mentors with one from another track and a methodology mentor. Trainees
will participate in a rigorous, structured program that includes formal coursework, training in the responsible
conduct of research, and workshops and seminars. Trainees will gain career development experiences and
build a professorial network through scientific writing; presentations; grant preparation and review; and
leadership opportunities. Special programming designed to improve expertise in rural cancer disparities
includes research shadowing, experience, a personalized rural cancer patient experience, and attendance at
rural health disparities conferences. We will track trainee progress and mentor support through detailed
annual evaluation. ARISE will build a next generation of cancer behavioral researchers aiming to achieve rural
health equity."
10888212,"ABSTRACT
In patients with tuberculosis (TB), detrimental immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection
dominate over beneficial immunity, resulting in uncontrolled Mtb replication, lung granulomas and progression
to TB disease. Immunosuppressive pathways induced by Mtb promote lung pathology and tissue damage and
prevent protective immune responses. This suboptimal lung microenvironment can also interfere with antibiotic-
mediated killing of Mtb. Therefore, in-depth understanding of immunosuppressive mechanisms during TB is
critical for developing novel immunomodulatory therapies that tip the balance away from pathogenic responses
and towards protective immunity and better bacterial clearance. Thus, host-directed therapies (HDT) that target
immunosuppressive pathways in conjunction with anti-TB antibiotics have the potential to improve TB treatment.
Recent studies show that a population of immature myeloid cells that are recruited to the lung after Mtb infection
contribute to immunosuppression during TB. These cells, termed myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs),
were first described in cancer as negatively regulating tumor microenvironments and suppressing NK cell and T
cell cytotoxic functions. Interestingly, accumulation of MDSCs correlates with TB disease pathology and these
cells can also harbor Mtb intracellularly. However, in contrast to cancer, the functions of MDSCs in TB are poorly
understood. We hypothesize that MDSCs prevent beneficial innate and adaptive immune responses to Mtb
infection by suppressing T cell, NK cell and macrophage functions. We further hypothesize that depleting MDSCs
in Mtb-infected mice will enhance immune responses to Mtb in the lung and significantly improve TB treatment
efficacy.
We have developed a versatile and effective approach to deplete MDSCs in the lung via novel multivalent
synthetic nanoparticle antibodies (SNAbs) that specifically target and deplete MDSCs through antibody-like
killing mechanisms. In this MPI-R01 application, we combine expertise in TB pathogenesis and immunology
research (Rengarajan, Emory) with expertise in immuno-engineering and nanotherapeutics (Roy, Georgia-Tech)
to investigate the role of MDSCs in TB disease progression and pathology, and regulating immunity to TB, and
to explore MDSCs as targets of HDT for TB. We will investigate the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Evaluate
how depleting MDSCs using SNAbs impacts TB disease progression. Aim 2. Investigate how MDSCs suppress
immune responses to Mtb infection. Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that depletion of MDSCs will enhance the
efficacy of anti-TB treatment. Together, these studies will advance our understanding of how MDSCs suppress
immunity to TB and provide insights into MDSCs as targets for adjunctive HDTs."
10925163,"Gene expression is a fundamental problem at the core of life science. All cells in an adult organism contain an
identical set of genes, but their expression varies widely depending on the context, such as cell type and
environmental queues. Transcription is the critical first step in gene expression, which is intricately controlled
by complex regulations and the disruption is pathogenic for many diseases. Much knowledge about the
mechanism has been gained using fixed cells and sequencing assays. Nonetheless, we still do not understand
how the variability of transcription is regulated in living mammals, dynamically in space and time, as the animal
performs development, physiology, and cognitive tasks such as learning. In particular, the role of the cis-
regulatory elements (i.e., enhancers) plays in the context-dependent transcriptional dynamics is obscure. Here
we will develop technology for addressing the current bottleneck. Over the past years, our laboratory has
advanced methods for visualizing transcriptional dynamics in the brain of live mouse (‘intravital MS2
technology’). Single molecules of mRNA of a gene of interest have been imaged in a specific cell type by
intravital multiphoton microscopy (MPM), revealing previously unknown properties of nascent transcripts in
vivo. For the next five years, we will demonstrate more versatile intravital MS2 technology geared toward the
functional annotation of the genome. Taking inspirations from the prior success of illuminating the structure and
function of the neuronal network in vivo, we will fuse intravital MPM, smart molecular sensors, and genomic
engineering to dissect the function of the transcriptional regulatory network in live murine brains. Our research

10832631,"The goal of this project is to evaluate a novel inhibitor of the 12/15 lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) enzyme in
preclinical rodent models of ischemic stroke within the SPAN network. To this end, BPN-27332 will be tested in
comparison with other preclinical stroke treatments under rigorous conditions in multiple laboratories.
12/15-LOX has been shown to be up-regulated in the ischemic peri-infarct area in both rodents and humans. It
contributes to both neuronal cell death, as well as to weakening of the blood – brain barrier and edema
formation. Alox15(-/-) mice in which the gene encoding 12/15-LOX has been knocked out, are protected in
models of transient focal ischemia. Through the NIH Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Program we have developed
BPN-27332, a novel and highly selective inhibitor of 12/15-LOX. In a mouse model of transient focal ischemia,
BPN-27332 reduces infarct size when given in the acute phase. Protection is long lasting, with significant
behavioral benefits still seen four weeks after the experimental stroke with excellent ADME and PK/PD
properties. We now propose to test BPN-27332 in a blinded fashion in comparison with vehicle, but also with
other treatment modalities. In Aim 1, the compound is subjected to rigorous quality control measures, including
verification of identity and purity by HPLC and mass spectrometry and in vitro efficacy testing. In Aim 2, the
compound will be shipped to the Coordinating Center for distribution to the testing sites, where BPN-27332 will
be extensively tested in rodent models of ischemic stroke. Successful completion of these studies will ready
BPN-27332 for clinical trials in human patients, which will hopefully lead to a much needed new treatment
option for patients with ischemic strokes."
10931346,"Project Summary/Abstract
 In 2021, Kenya’s Ministry of Health’s Department of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) issued a strategic
plan to “halt and reverse” the country’s rising NCD burden. Worldwide, the most common forms of NCD
among children and adolescents are mental health disorders and injuries/violence. Ample research supports
the causal pathway between early childhood adversity, in particular child maltreatment, and vulnerability to a
range of NCD in later life through toxic stress and biological embedding. A major risk factor for NCD in Kenya
is childhood maltreatment, with up to 70% of Kenyans report experiencing maltreatment during childhood
typically by their parents due to lack of appropriate parenting skills, misunderstanding of child development,
not providing proper medical attention, and obstacles to providing basic needs and adequate supervision.
While parenting prevention programs are evidence-based approaches to remedy risk factors for NCD, and
Kenya has begun the arduous task of addressing NCD burden, a significant gap remains in public health
approaches to prevention work targeting the youngest Kenyans. The purpose of this R01 proposal is to
conduct a Hybrid Type 2 study to examine the implementation and effectiveness of the recently adapted
evidenced-based program, SafeCare, as a primary prevention approach to address the country’s NCD burden.
SafeCare Kenya (SCK) improves parenting skills, reducing the likelihood of child maltreatment and subsequent
risk for NCD. This project will continue the six-year partnerships amongst Africa Mental Health Research and
Training Foundation (AMHRTF; Nairobi-based partner), Pacific University, Georgia State University and its
National SafeCare Training and Research Center (SafeCare developers), and key country and regional
stakeholders, including families, professionals, government, and researchers to scale-up and disseminate SCK.
This project leverages Kenya’s Community Health Volunteers (CHV), the well-established and primary
workforce for maternal and child physical health in Kenya, to implement the intervention. Virtual and in-
person delivery modes will be examined to identify the best method for sustainability. Three specific aims
will be accomplished in this 5-year study: (1) Determine clinical effectiveness of SCK using a parallel group
multilevel-randomized trial. (2) Determine feasibility and probable utility of SCK implementation. (3) Initiate
efforts to begin scale-up and sustainment of SCK across Kenya. We will recruit 312 families paired with 24 CHV
randomly assigned to deliver SCK (16 Providers; 208 families) or care as usual (8 Providers; 104 families). Our
project’s long-term goals are to: (1) build sustainable research and implementation capacity in Kenya and
Africa and (2) disseminate a culturally relevant, evidence-based parenting program to promote children’s
wellbeing and reduce risk of NCD across the lifespan."

New medical discoveries and health care reforms are emerging at a pace that far exceeds our current capacity
to translate new tests and treatments into an ever-evolving clinical environment. As such, while training in the
skills required for bench to bedside translation remains fundamental, there is also a compelling need to expand
the pool of epidemiological scientists capable of performing the clinical, health services, comparative
effectiveness, dissemination and implementation research necessary to translate scientific discoveries not only
into clinical practice but into population health benefits as well. This UM Urological Epidemiology (UroEPI)
Institutional Research Career Development Program (K12) inspires and provides junior investigators/scholars
with the necessary technical skills so that he/she can initiate and sustain an independent research program in
the study of the epidemiology of benign urological conditions and embrace the interdisciplinarity of our
institution. The UroEPI K12 consists of two principal components: 1) one year of didactic course work with
concentrations in epidemiology and biostatistics; and 2) one year of applied experience in the conception,
execution, and dissemination of a well-designed research project. Guided by their faculty mentor, scholars will
be instructed in the philosophy, ethics and theory behind epidemiological research, as well as methodological
techniques derived from a broad array of clinical, public health and social sciences. The Director and Co-
Director will undertake administration of this program while progress will be monitored continuously by
mentors, and biannually by the Mentor Steering Committee (MSC). Scholars will be expected to present their
work to the MSC as well as at national scientific conferences. By the end of the training program, scholars will
have completed both the requirements for an advanced research degree and a mentored research project,
including publication of their findings in the peer-reviewed literature. Graduates of this training program will be
well positioned to establish a longitudinal research agenda and to pursue an independent research career in
academic Urology with a focus on the epidemiology of benign urological conditions."

 Type B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) is a lethal disease which occurs when a tear develops in
the inner lining (intimal layer) of the aorta, causing the layers of the aortic wall to separate (dissect)
creating “true” and “false” lumens. Complicated TBADs with presence of either organ
malperfusion or aortic rupture have a high in-hospital mortality rate and require emergent surgical
or endovascular therapy. Uncomplicated TBADs have been traditionally managed with optimal
medical therapy (OMT) consisting of aggressive anti-hypertensive therapy and surveillance
imaging. OMT results in low in-hospital mortality rates, but dismal long-term survival rates of 48-
66%, and overall intervention-free survival rates of less than 50% secondary to aortic aneurysm
formation and rupture. These poor long-term outcomes support a paradigm change in the
treatment of the uncomplicated TBADs. Thus, there is an urgent and unmet clinical need for
promptly identifying those uncomplicated TBAD patients that will likely fail OMT in the acute phase,
and thus benefit from early intervention such as Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR).
 Therefore, the objective of this project is to develop a risk stratification model for predicting
both failure of OMT and the optimal timing of intervention in uncomplicated TBAD patients. To
achieve this goal, a retrospective analysis will be conducted for about 500 uncomplicated TBAD
patients from the Emory Aortic Databank. Clinical and anatomic data will be harvested from the
electronic medical record and image studies to identify predictors of OMT failure. Next, using the
same patient database, a series of mechanical experiments will be performed to obtain
hyperelastic and failure properties of the TBAD tissues, from which rupture/tear risk metrics will
be developed. Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analyses will be validated and applied to obtain
“heat maps” of hemodynamic and wall stress fields. The risk indices will be consequently
extracted. For patients with longitudinal imaging data, TBAD progression will be predicted using
an integrated growth and remodeling (G&R) and dissection propagation model. Critical
biomechanical parameters will be identified as potential predictors of OMT failure. Finally,
machine learning (ML) techniques will be used to combine clinical and biomechanical predictors
to develop a multi-factorial, personalized TBAD risk stratification model. To evaluate the
performance of the proposed approach, we will recruit and perform a longitudinal follow-up study
of 35 acute uncomplicated TBAD patients to validate our approach by comparing the ML-model-
prediction results with actual clinical outcomes."

Mechanical forces generated by the cellular actomyosin cytoskeleton are largely responsible for shaping sheets
of epithelial cells into tissues and organs. During these morphogenetic events, the forces produced by myosin
might locally promote or resist these shape changes. Our current understanding of how the structure of a myosin
network influences tissue fluidity, the propensity of a tissue to remodel and flow, is lacking. In particular, it is not
well understood why some epithelial cell sheets remodel and flow like fluids, while other stretch and bend like
elastic solids, or how this is regulated during specific morphogenetic events. The goal of this project is to combine
nanoengineering and optogenetic techniques to measure and manipulate tissues with high spatiotemporal
precision to undercover the roles of actomyosin forces in tissue fluidity and morphogenesis. I will address these
challenges by (1) studying myosin networks and tissue fluidity during convergent extension in Drosophila
melanogaster, (2) quantitatively analyzing the forces generated by epithelial tissue sheets in vitro on
nanofabricated substrates, and (3) applying these findings to tissues grown on a nanomaterial flexible substrate
in an attempt to synthetically reconstitute and study three-dimensional tissue morphogenesis. These studies will
improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying how cells collectively self-organize and how
perturbations in these mechanisms can lead to disease states."

Despite being the most common myopathy after the age of 50, inclusion body myositis (IBM) pathogenesis
remains poorly understood. Traditionally, IBM is considered an inflammatory myopathy. However, unlike other
inflammatory myopathies, IBM almost never happens before the age of 40, has histopathological features of
rimmed vacuoles and protein aggregates reminiscent of other neurodegenerative diseases, and remains
refractory to all forms of immunotherapy. Patients continue to progress relentlessly and most become
wheelchair dependent within 20 years from onset. Therefore, there is a critical need to determine the
underlying disease mechanisms that would offer a unifying holistic explanation of the involved downstream
immune and degenerative processes, and help identify new therapeutic targets. Our central hypothesis is that
declining mitochondrial function plays a primary role in IBM pathogenesis, which after reaching a critical
threshold at a certain age, triggers downstream inflammatory and degenerative pathways. The overall
objective of this application is to define the underexplored role of mitochondria in IBM pathogenesis, aiming in
the long term to identify better diagnostic biomarkers and novel evidence-based therapeutic targets for clinical

other organelles in IBM, by using 3D Scanning Electron Microscopy. 2) Identify the specific molecular level of
mitochondrial dysfunction in IBM by a series of cutting-edge techniques. 3) Define the disease-specific

Adolescence is characterized by improvements in executive function, increased plasticity, and the continued
refinement of neuronal mechanisms. Importantly, it is also a time when neurobiological mechanisms are actively
specializing, where strays from neurotypical development may lead to the emergence of psychopathology. To
understand how atypical brain maturation may lead to neuropsychiatric disorders, typical adolescent
development needs to be better understood. Previous postmortem human and animal models have shown
developmental changes in the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance derived from changes in the excitatory glutamate
and inhibitory Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) neurotransmitters. Decreases in the E/I balance have been
shown to optimize neural systems supporting cognitive control through the stabilization of gamma oscillations,
generated by parvalbumin (PV) GABAergic interneurons and measurable through electroencephalography
(EEG). However, there is limited understanding of the developmental changes in the E/I balance and its impact
on the neuronal mechanisms characterizing this critical period of development. Thus, this project aims to
investigate the shift in the E/I balance, as implicated by developmental changes in the balance of
glutamate and GABA, to characterize the neuronal underpinnings of neurotypical adolescent cognitive
development. To accomplish this, we will 1) assess developmental changes in neural activity underlying working
memory and its association with glutamate and GABA using multimodal neuroimaging techniques, including
electroencephalography (EEG), 7T Magnetic Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) (Aim 1), and
stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) (Aim 2), and 2) use computational modeling to identify the micro-level
neuronal underpinnings of adolescent brain development (Aim 3). During this process, the candidate will gain
invaluable knowledge in technical methodologies, such as data collection, analysis, computational modeling,
clinical neuroscience, and written and oral communication. This study will advance our understanding of
neurotypical adolescent development, which is a critical step towards assessing impaired development that can
lead to psychopathology, which predominantly emerges in adolescence (e.g., psychosis, mood disorders,
substance use disorders). Altogether, this project will support the ability of the candidate to become an expert
bioengineering-psychiatry researcher, integrating engineering principles and developmental cognitive
neuroscience that can inform the mental health field."

HIV eradication requires the elimination of latent reservoirs composed by cells harboring persistent proviruses.
The brain is an anatomical site that is poorly accessible to the immune system as well as therapeutic agents. It
also harbors a specific type of cells, microglia, where HIV can silently persist for long periods of time.
Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are a group of transposable elements, which are mostly held in an
inactive state by different epigenetic mechanisms. Narcotic use induces changes the epigenetic landscape that
can influence latency establishment and HERV expression. This project’s goal is to test the hypothesis that the
distinct HERV expression signatures detected in HIV LTR-silent infection affect latency establishment and that
this can be influenced by narcotic treatment. Furthermore, latent HIV-specific HERV expression can be
exploited for the discovery of HIV latency specific markers. In order to investigate these hypotheses, it is
crucial to determine the precise identity of the HERV elements expressed during latency.
The experimental strategy is based on our newly developed reporter virus, which distinguishes latently infected
from productively infected microglia cells in combination with our established proteogenomic approach which
integrates HERV-specific RNA expression analysis with mass spec analysis. Such highly specialized
processing is required because of the repetitive nature of HERVs that so far has undermined their detailed
investigation. The RNA and protein expression blueprint obtained will inform on the ranking of the latent HIV-
specific HERVs whose relevance will be investigated utilizing state of the art CRISPR-based expression
induction in primary microglia as well as for the detection their expression in brain tissue form HIV patients with
and without documented history on narcotic use. We expect that the innovative experimental approach
proposed will provide insight into HERV RNA/protein expression landscapes in latently infected primary
microglia and offer potential causal links between latency establishment, HERV expression and substance
abuse.
Even though there are high-risk aspects in this proposal, the experimental strategy proposed will deliver
predictable, high gain benefits in our understanding of the complex biology underlying HIV latency in the brain
compartment."

Worldwide, up to 3% of people will experience psychosis, a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental and
neurodegenerative brain disorder typically characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and functional decline.
Currently, clinicians can identify adolescents and young adults who are at clinical high risk (CHR) for developing
psychosis. However, as the mechanisms leading to development of psychosis are not fully known, we have
limited ability to predict who will develop psychosis. Safe intervention in this population requires high confidence
in predictive biomarkers that can stratify individuals into likely clinical trajectories, and match them with effective
treatments. Africa has a very limited early psychosis research effort, resulting in a substantial gap in our
knowledge about the ethnic heterogeneity of the high-risk state. Recently, a multi-site international effort, the
Psychosis-Risk Outcomes Network (ProNET), was funded by the NIH to analyze variation in a diverse set of
biomarkers to predict individual CHR clinical trajectories. However, while countries in North America, Europe
and Asia are included in this landmark effort, it includes no African country. This is relevant, as risk genes for
psychosis as well as the clinical and cultural presentation of psychosis often differ across ethnic groups. This
proposal aims to build research capacity in Kenya, using state-of-the-art multimodal methods in Kenya identical
to that applied in the ProNET study, in order to map clinical outcomes in CHR populations (Aim 1). This involves
building ERP/EEG infrastructure in Nairobi, by acquiring research grade acquisition equipment and software;
MRI upgrades, including advanced diffusion and fMRI BOLD imaging capability; and elaborate research training.
In Aim 2, we will collect multi-modal biomarkers over 24 months (eight timepoints) from 100 CHR participants
(aged 15-22) including brain MRI, ERP/EEG, psychopathology, cognition, genetics, and cortisol. Healthy
volunteers (N=50) will complete baseline assessment to quantify typical variation. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis
that psychosis outcomes in Kenyan CHR populations will differ from the international ProNET CHR cohort,
including a lower rate of psychosis conversion and improved functioning. MRI and ERP analyses are expected
to find orbitofrontal cortical thinning and reduced P300 (auditory P3b) amplitude with psychosis progression.
Together, this work would address key existing knowledge gaps in global CHR research and provide insights
into ethnic heterogeneity of outcomes among CHR patients. By building capacity in CHR clinical and biomarker-
based research in Kenya, we will facilitate sub-Saharan Africa joining future international research efforts."

Approximately two thirds of patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) experience falls; a primary cause of
hospitalization and nursing home admission. These debilitating features of PD are resistant to dopamine
replacement therapy, emphasizing the urgent need for basic research and therapeutic development focused on
non-dopaminergic systems degenerating in PD. We previously established a rodent model of PD falls and
developed novel behavioral paradigms that reflect critical elements of PD falls. Our work identified disruptions of
the Attentional-Motor Interface (AMI) network as a major pathophysiologic substrate of impaired gait and balance
in PD. The novel Michigan Complex Motor Control Task (MCMCT) assesses falls resulting from impaired AMI
function in rats. We also demonstrated that rats with dual losses of cortical cholinergic and striatal dopamine (DL
rats), reflecting PET-based findings in PD fallers, exhibit high rates of falls on the MCMCT. As in PD fallers,
impairments in attention of DL rats predict fall rates. Treatment with an α4β2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
agonist, combination treatments of AChase inhibitors and a 5-HT6 receptor antagonist (idalopirdine) reduce fall
rates, indicating translational value of our system. We now propose rigorous mechanistic studies identifying
critical synaptic dysfunction within key AMI nodes. We will assess the role of basal forebrain cholinergic signaling
in falls (Aim 1), of cholinergically-driven cortico-striatal information transfer (Aim 2), and of the role of striatal
cholinergic interneurons (Aim 3). This work will directly complement the research of Projects I and III. The
proposed research is supported by extensive preliminary evidence demonstrating: 1) the impact of optogenetic
manipulations of basal forebrain cholinergic signaling on complex movement control; 2) that cues guiding
complex movements are “imported’ into the striatum via cortico-striatal glutamatergic activity; 3) that DREADD-
based inhibition or stimulation of striatal cholinergic interneuronal activity cause and prevent falls, respectively;
4) that these interneurons broadly code cues utilized to execute movements. The proposed research will identify
mechanisms of nodal and synaptic AMI dysfunctions, identify novel intervention targets, extend a valuable
preclinical model for therapy development, and substantiate falls as a useful behavioral endpoint for studying
key nodes of the AMI."
10931698,"PROJECT III: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cognitive deficits are a morbid dopamine replacement therapy-refractory feature of Parkinson disease (PD).
The pathophysiology of PD-related cognitive deficits is complex, likely involving interacting and variable
impairments of several brain systems, particularly in early to moderate disease. Incidence and natural history
of PD cognitive deficits is heterogeneous. Understanding the pathophysiologies of PD cognitive impairments is
essential for development of personalized therapies. PD heterogeneity is a major obstacle to effective clinical
research. Identifying PD subgroups will enhance discovery of useful interventions through subgroup specific or
stratified clinical trials, identify biomarkers, improve prognosis assessment in clinical care, and assist
etiopathogenic research. Some of the “highest priority recommendations” of the NINDS PD 2014 Research
Report call for research to understand the pathophysiology of cognitive impairments and for PD subgroup
identification. The U-M Udall Center established a deeply phenotyped PD cohort imaged with the vesicular
acetylcholine transporter PET ligand [18F]FEOBV, revealing heterogeneous cholinergic deficits. Cholinergic
terminal deficits in Cingulo-Opercular Task Control network (COTC) nodes – Anterior Cingulate and Insular
Cortices (AC-I) – correlate with both domain specific and global cognitive deficits. An important component of
the Attentional-Motor Interface (AMI; Overall Component), the COTC subserves tonic attention, coordinating
network activities across different cognitive domains. Preliminary analysis suggests that early COTC node (AC-
I) cholinergic deficits are a subgroup defining-feature in PD, predicting more rapid cognitive decline. The central
hypothesis of Project III is that early COTC node (AC-I) cholinergic denervation contributes significantly to
cognitive impairment in early to moderate PD and identifies a PD subgroup with accelerated cognitive decline.
In addition to our established Udall subject cohort, we have access to a separate cohort of incident PD subjects
through collaboration with the University of Groningen, deeply phenotyped and imaged with [18F]FEOBV PET,
for rigorous experimental replication and validation of our primary hypothesis. We will correlate early COTC
node (AC-I) cholinergic denervation with domain-specific and general measures of cognitive function. In a
prospective analyses, we will determine if early COTC node (AC-I) cholinergic denervation predicts more rapid
cognitive decline. In an integrated analysis with Project I, we will determine if COTC node (AC-I) cholinergic
denervation is associated with Freezing of Gait (FoG). In exploratory analyses, we will assess if more accessible
MRI or other measures correlate with COTC node (AC-I) cholinergic denervation, identifying potential,
accessible biomarkers of COTC node (AC-I) cholinergic denervation. Project III will identify an important
substrate of PD cognitive impairment and identify a PD subgroup with a more aggressive natural history - a
“malignant hypocholinergic disease phenotype.” These results will identify potential targets for therapeutic
interventions and biomarker development."
10931701,"CATALYST RESEARCH PROJECT: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Many patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) suffer from spatial disorientation – inability to link external landmark
cues to internal estimates of self-orientation. These deficits are not improved by dopamine replacement therapy
(DRT). The same spatial disorientation features are found in patients with specific lesions, due to a stroke or
hemorrhage, of the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), a brain region critical for encoding the combination of allocentric
and egocentric navigational information. Attentional and emotional processing impairments in PD patients are
accompanied by altered BOLD responses in the retrosplenial cortex. The retrosplenial cortex is densely
interconnected with the secondary motor cortex, hippocampus, visual cortex, cingulate cortex and anterior
thalamus (containing head orientation cells), and is therefore part of the Attentional-Motor Interface (AMI) and
ideally positioned to help transform attentional and spatial information into planned actions. Furthermore, multiple
basal forebrain structures send cholinergic projections to the RSC. There are pronounced increases in
acetylcholine (ACh) release in the retrosplenial cortex during attentive spatial navigation. Cholinergic deficits,
such as those seen in PD, are likely to severely impair the spatial orientation functions of the retrosplenial cortex.
Little is known about 1) how cholinergic inputs influence the synapses, cells and circuits of the retrosplenial
circuits, and 2) the impact of cholinergic dysfunction on retrosplenial-dependent spatial orientation and
navigation. Our central hypothesis is that dysfunctional cholinergic systems projecting to the retrosplenial cortex
will manifest in altered navigational encoding by retrosplenial circuits and spatially disoriented behaviors. In Aim
1, we will decipher the mechanisms of cholinergic control of retrosplenial cells and synapses, with preliminary
data suggesting both cell-type- and synapse-specific cholinergic controls. In Aim 2, we will investigate how the
loss of cholinergic inputs impairs retrosplenial encoding of space and how it impacts orientation-guided
movement. The successful completion of these Aims will elucidate the contributions of the retrosplenial
orientation coding circuit to the Attentional-Motor Interface, and lay the groundwork for understanding how
altered perception of spatial orientation in Parkinson’s disease can directly impact motor control."
10913328,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
In new settings, we have a remarkable ability to generalize from prior learning to help us achieve our goals. This
capacity is thought to depend on our ability to represent the common relationships present in related experiences,
such as the series of steps involved in grocery shopping at any one of a variety of supermarkets. These context-
generalized representations of a task have been termed schemas. In the brain, schemas are thought to be
represented by neural ensembles that encode a task similarly across contexts. Recent work has identified
schema representations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). How these schema representations form and support
rapid learning in new contexts, however, is not well understood.
A well-established theory of long-term memory formation known as systems consolidation theory provides a
model for how schema representations may arise in the brain. According to this theory, the hippocampus (HPc)
rapidly encodes memories of specific episodes in new contexts. In periods of rest that follow, these HPc
memories are reactivated, and this is thought to result in the long-lasting strengthening of corresponding memory
traces within and across neocortex. The resulting neocortical memories are thought to emphasize common
features across contexts, providing a basis for schema representation. Our overarching hypothesis based on the
theory of systems consolidation is that HPc memory reactivation promotes the formation of schema
representations in PFC (Aims 1 and 3), and expression of these representations in new contexts in turn enables
rapid learning (Aims 2 and 3). To test this hypothesis, we will pair a rat model of learning in new contexts wherein
rats exhibit rapid learning given prior experience, with simultaneous recordings of PFC and HPc neural
ensembles (Aims 1–3) and causal intervention studies (Aim 3).
Completion of these Aims has the potential to yield fundamental insights into the neural substrates of
generalization from past experience. Our findings will additionally provide important evidence for or against
longstanding predictions of systems consolidation theory that have so far been difficult to test in the absence of
distributed simultaneous recordings. This study will be carried out in the lab of my research sponsor, Dr. Loren
Frank, at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). The Frank lab is located in Sandler Neurosciences
Center, which is home to a highly innovative and collaborative community of faculty and students pursuing
neuroscience questions. My training plan under this fellowship will prepare me for an independent career as an
academic physician scientist with the long-term goal of revealing neural computations underlying cognitive
processes. In addition to the proposed research, this preparation will be achieved through rigorous quantitative
coursework, planned engagement with vibrant intellectual communities, and clinically geared activities."

The PI of this application is a physician-scientists with a career focus on developing improved care for patients
with sickle cell disease (SCD). The acute chest syndrome (ACS) represents a serious, potentially fatal
inflammatory lung injury syndrome occurring in patients with SCD. ACS shares many features of the
inflammatory lung injury associated with acute lung injury and is the second most common cause of SCD
hospitalization, is a major cause of acute and chronic SCD morbidity and mortality, is the leading cause of SCD
ICU admission and premature death. There is increasing appreciation that ACS is an acute hypoxia-induced
lung injury syndrome targeting the lung endothelium in response to multiple exogenous insults or triggers
leading to pulmonary erythrocyte sequestration, an exaggerated inflammatory response, increased expression
of adhesion molecules and impairment of pulmonary vascular function. In this highly translational proposal we
will address the hypothesis that vascular-targeted genetic and genomic strategies for ACS will lead to better
understanding of the pathobiology of ACS, generate novel ACS biomarkers in SCD patients and produce
vascular-specific therapies for ameliorating this devastating health disparity. To address this hypothesis, in
Specific Aim #1 we will test and validate the potential of T-cell receptor repertoire profiling as modifiers and
biomarkers of ACS susceptibility. Specific Aim #2 will interrogate the role of RASA3 as a molecular target in
murine ACS. In Specific Aim #3 we will interrogate the role of endothelial cell lipid droplets as a molecular and
therapeutic target in murine ACS. Together, these highly translational approaches hold the promise to identify
novel targets and biomarkers that may lead to better treatment options for patients with ACS."
11090316,"Liver cirrhosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Veterans, primarily due to complications such as
ascites and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). HE is linked with a systemic pro-inflammatory milieu propagated by
an impaired intestinal barrier and gut dysbiosis. Despite maximal therapy (lactulose/rifaximin), a significant
proportion of Veterans have HE that continues to recur, which is a major burden on their caregivers and VHA
system. We have recently published a small randomized trial of fecal microbial transplantation (FMT), in this
population, which was safe and prevented total and HE-related hospitalizations. This was associated with
favorable bile acid (BA) and microbial changes which lasted for >1 year with one FMT. A similar small oral
capsule FMT trial is underway at our center with good safety signals. There is also evidence in non-cirrhotic
FMT studies that microbe-free portions can be as effective as full FMT. However, the mechanism of action of
FMT in cirrhosis is needs further investigation.
We hypothesize that “Fecal microbial transplant delivered from the combined oral and rectal route is safe, well-
tolerated and associated with lower hospitalizations, improved modulation of gut microbial composition and
functionality and brain function in patients with hepatic encephalopathy compared to those treated with FMT
from either routes alone or with placebo; this improvement is mediated by microbial products”. We will test this
hypothesis using two translational aims
Aim 1: To determine the effect of dual oral and rectal administration of FMT from a rational donor on
clinical outcomes (hospitalizations, brain function, quality of life) and host-microbiota interactions
(microbial composition and bile acid composition with systemic and intestinal inflammation),
compared to single route of administration and placebo, in cirrhotic patients with HE using a
randomized, phase II clinical trial. Outpatients with recurrent HE (n=100) will be randomized into four groups
(Group 1: Dual oral and rectal FMT, Group 2: Oral FMT and rectal placebo, Group 3: Oral placebo and Rectal
FMT and Group 4: Oral and rectal placebo) and followed for 6 months under an FDA IND double-blind clinical
trial. FMT donors will be selected using machine learning on the basis of beneficial taxa from OpenBiome
donors (collaborator), which will be used for all FMT-assigned subjects. The primary outcome is all-cause
hospitalizations. Patients will undergo baseline evaluation for cirrhosis severity, brain function, intestinal
permeability along with collection of serum and stool and fecal bile acid profile analysis. Patients will be
followed till 6 months for outcomes. We will define the effect of FMT on systemic inflammation, intestinal
permeability, bile acid profile, and its linkage with microbial composition and clinical outcomes between groups.
Aim 2: To determine the effect of human FMT on neuro-inflammation and gut microbial function using
germ-free mice and conventional cirrhotic mice with microbe-rich and microbe-free (sterile)
supernatants from the FMT donors. It is not clear which components of the FMT material, the microbes or
their products such as bile acids, mediate its effects. Entire and microbe-free supernatants generated from
pooled FMT donor samples, recipients’ baseline samples and post-FMT samples, will be used to humanize GF
mice. In addition, conventional cirrhotic mice will receive healthy donor material using the same protocol.
Differences in neuro-inflammation will be studied between conventional cirrhotic and GF mice after colonization
and between those colonized with entire samples and with only microbial products. A specific change in
intestinal bile acid profile as a mediator of these changes will be investigated.
The team has been working cohesively with expertise in clinical and translational cirrhosis research in
Veterans. These results will set the foundation for future trials determining the role of FMT in liver disease and
help define better donor-patient matches from a microbial perspective in this underserved population."

Hemophilia A (HemA) results from a deficiency of factor VIII (FVIII) gene (abbreviated as F8 in constructs).
Traditional treatment of HemA patients is repeated infusions of FVIII, which is costly, inconvenient, short-term,
and incompletely effective. In addition, approximately 25% of treated patients develop anti-FVIII immune
responses. Development of inhibitory antibodies (inhibitors) significantly increases morbidity and lowers life
quality for these patients. Treatment for hemophilia inhibitor patients includes use of bypassing agents or immune
tolerance induction (ITI) with high doses of FVIII or new therapies with bioengineered factor Xa, a humanized
bispecific antibody (emicizumab; ACE910), and others. However, frequent infusions of costly reagent are
required, and potential long-term side effects still need to be evaluated. Compared to drug or protein therapy,
gene therapy can achieve a prolonged therapeutic effect with only one or several treatments over the lifetime.
AAV-mediated gene therapy showed very promising results in clinical trials however is not accessible to a
significant portion of patients including pediatric patients and patients with anti-AAV or anti-FVIII antibodies.
Recently ex vivo HSC gene therapy targeting FVIII expression in megakaryocytes (Megs) corrected the bleeding
diathesis even in the presence of inhibitors. This is because FVIII is stored in α-granules and only released at
the injury sites during platelet activation, therefore protected from circulating inhibitors. However, several
limitations exist for ex vivo gene therapy. Our approach to direct long-term expression of FVIII in platelets is
intraosseous (IO) infusion of lentiviral vectors (LVs) (IO-LV gene therapy) carrying a FVIII transgene driven by a
Meg-specific promoter GpIbα (G-F8-LVs). In this in vivo gene therapy protocol, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)
were efficiently transduced by LVs in situ, resulting in FVIII expression in Megs and storage in platelet α-granules.
A single IO infusion of G-F8-LV leads to phenotype correction in HemA mice. In vivo delivery of LVs can avoid
many difficulties and potential toxicities encountered by ex vivo gene therapy including low engraftment potential
and pre-conditioning of the subject which induces thrombocytopenia, a particularly undesirable complication for
hemophilia patients. In vivo gene therapy can bypass this significant hemostatic risk.
Previously we have demonstrated very promising results to correct hemophilia phenotype following IO-LV gene
therapy in HemA mice both with and without pre-existing inhibitors. In order to develop a clinically feasible
protocol for human applications, we propose to enhance the efficacy and safety of this strategy in HemA mice.
Furthermore, we will examine the efficacy and safety in human cells using novel humanized NSGW41 and
HemA/NSG/VWFRH/RH transgenic mice. Lastly, we have initiated the study of IO-LV gene therapy in HemA dogs.
We will further improve the protocol to achieve long-term phenotypic correction in HemA dogs with and without
inhibitors. These studies are essential for pushing forward this new novel technology for a clinical trial to treat
HemA patients with and without inhibitors."

Dr. Traci Kennedy, PI of the proposed K23, is a clinical scientist whose long-term goal is to lead a program of
research on developing and testing interventions to reduce problematic alcohol use among vulnerable young
people, especially young adults with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Problematic alcohol use
among young adults (ages 18-25) has severe individual and societal consequences, yet most go untreated.
ADHD significantly elevates risk and limits the effectiveness of existing treatments. Inhibitory control is a key
transdiagnostic and modifiable risk factor underlying both ADHD and problematic alcohol use. This K23 project
aims to develop and test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a novel, accessible mobile-health (mHealth)
intervention that targets in-the-moment inhibitory control to reduce problematic drinking among young adults with
ADHD. Text messages will prompt the use of behavioral strategies to enhance inhibitory control throughout the
day and in high-risk moments. To motivate behavioral strategy use, ecological momentary assessment (EMA)
of ADHD symptoms and personalized, adaptive feedback will boost self-awareness of inhibitory control deficits.
Aim 1 is to develop feasible and acceptable behavioral strategy prompts. First, strategy content will be developed
in a subsample (n=10) of young adult drinkers with ADHD from an in-progress pilot study (Study 1a). Next,
strategy prompt content and delivery timing and frequency will be refined in a new pilot sample (n=16) of young
adults with ADHD who consume 4+/5+ drinks/occasion (female/male) weekly (i.e., heavy episodic drinkers) with
input from a panel of key stakeholders (Study 1b). Aim 2 is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the
resulting intervention among heavy episodic drinkers (N=70) with ADHD, half randomly assigned to the
intervention and half to an alcohol monitoring control condition for 3 weeks (Study 2). The utility of passively
sensed smartphone indices of inhibitory control (e.g., screen unlock rate) will be explored to inform future
personalization. Aim 3 is to test preliminary intervention effects, including dynamic transactions among alcohol
use, inhibitory control, and life impairments. This innovative, scalable intervention addresses a critical need to
help young adults with ADHD curb problematic alcohol use. Outcomes will lead to a future fully-powered efficacy
trial. The proposed research and training (didactics, conferences, mentor-directed training) will equip the PI with
the requisite skills to launch an independent research career in alcohol interventions: competence in momentary
drinking capture; expertise in intervention science focused on mHealth; and in-depth knowledge of inhibitory
control. Dr. Sarah Pedersen (mentor), expert in momentary drinking processes, EMA, and inhibitory control, and
Dr. Brooke Molina (co-mentor), expert in intervention science with emphasis on ADHD and addictions, will guide
the PI’s training and research. A team of consultants will complement training (statistical analysis, alcohol
mHealth interventions development and evaluation, and passive sensing). This K23 has direct public health
implications and addresses NIAAA priorities on developing alcohol treatments for comorbid conditions."
10914643,"The endolysosomal network is the portal by which extracellular material enters the cell. As such, the
membranes of the endosomes, phagosomes, and lysosomes that comprise this network face challenges from
pathogens and other internalized materials as well as from metabolic and chemical stresses. Consequences of
damage vary according to the specific compartment and degree of damage, but extensive lysosomal
membrane permeabilization triggers cell death while limited disruption of endosomes and phagosomes by
particulate material and pathogens leads to inflammasome activation and ensuing cytokine responses. A
widely deployed strategy for removing damaged organelles involves the use of selective autophagy, referred to
as lysophagy. Removal is, however, unnecessary if organelles are instead repaired. We recently discovered a
new role for the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery in responding to nano-
scale disruptions in endolysosomal membranes and promoting their repair. In this proposal, we will build on
this discovery and test the hypothesis that ESCRTs (and in particular ESCRT-III proteins) act as a dynamic
membrane stabilizing system to protect vulnerable membranes across the endolysosomal network and
beyond. Two aims will exploit and explore responses to two experimentally tractable and sterile endolysosomal
disruptants that potently engage the ESCRT machinery. In Aim 1, we will determine how the ESCRT
machinery recognizes and counteracts lysosomal membrane stress induced by L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester
(LLOMe). This will involve characterizing the membrane stress responsible for engaging ESCRTs, defining the
molecular pathway(s) involved and identifying “keystone” ESCRT-III proteins, delineating the molecular
features required for repair, and identifying pathways that trigger this stabilizing response. In Aim 2, we will
examine how ESCRTs respond to and repair silica induced membrane damage in epithelial and phagocytic
cells. This will include testing a role for Fe2+-dependent lipid peroxidation in engaging ESCRTs, imaging the
relative role and dynamics of ESCRT components on phagosomal membranes, and testing the hypothesis that
ESCRTs limit endolysosomal damage in phagocytic cells and thereby dampen inflammation associated with
the many things that transit through these pathways. The insights gained from this work will be applicable to
understanding how ESCRTs sense and respond to a broad range of membrane stresses."

India is home to over 17% of the world’s population and to 25% of those who are blind or visually impaired
worldwide. Blindness and vision impairment are the fourth leading cause of years lived with disability in India
and are the number one cause in those age 70 and older, a segment of the Indian population that is rapidly
growing. Over 90% of vision loss in India is due to non-communicable disease, the majority of which is
avoidable. Poor vision is associated with wide-reaching consequences, including an increased risk of falls,
dementia, depression, disability, loss of independence, longer and more frequent hospitalizations, and
increased mortality. Despite the large and growing burden of non-communicable eye disease, particularly
among older adults, the shortage of research expertise in India to characterize the epidemic and understand its
causes and consequences is a critical barrier to intervening effectively and reducing its population health
impact. Therefore, the focus of this training program is on building clinical-epidemiological research capacity,
with an emphasis on lifecourse analyses applied to the study of non-communicable eye disease (NCED) in
older adults. Given the aging of the Indian population and the disproportionate impact of NCED on older
Indians, it is critical to train Indian vision researchers in the research principles and methods that will enable
them to effectively address this critical need. Moreover, we currently lack knowledge from a lifecourse
perspective to understand the effects of early- and mid-life exposures on late-life vision and vision-related
disability in India. Research specific to the Indian context is vital to determine key risk factors and disability
consequences of NCED, and to develop effective contextualized interventions. The proposed research
capacity building program will draw upon the exceptional institutional environments at the Aravind Eye Care
System (AECS) in India and at the University of Michigan (UM), including the NIH-funded UM Claude D.
Pepper Older Americans Independence Center and Clinical and Translational Science Award. The UM and
AECS have a long-standing history of collaboration and educational exchanges. Based on the results of a
needs assessment survey, doctoral- and masters-level training tracks have been designed to meet the needs
of early- and mid-career AECS faculty who aspire to careers in clinical-epidemiological research. The aims of
this program include: 1) to provide comprehensive graduate-level training in the conduct of clinical and
epidemiologic research for trainees from AECS who will be equipped to take a leading role in NCED and
sensory aging research in India; 2) to develop the mentoring and research education skills of AECS faculty;
and 3) to establish research training opportunities at AECS that are offered to a broad regional audience. All
training activities will be transitioned to AECS by the end of the 5-year grant period. Both partner institutions
are dedicated to the success of this training program and to its strong potential to address the growing
epidemic of NCED and visual disability among India’s rapidly aging population."
10815766,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease of unknown etiology leading to the destruction of
pancreatic beta cells, which secrete insulin and regulate glucose homeostasis. The incidence of T1D has been
increasing over the years, a trend inexplicable by only genetic predisposition, suggesting that environmental
factors such as viruses play an important role in triggering the disease. Decades of research have provided
epidemiological evidence for an association between T1D and viruses, particularly coxsackieviruses of the
Enterovirus genus. Patients with T1D had higher rates of antibodies anti-CVB, viral RNA and viral capsid protein
compared to non-diabetic. Studies have also shown that children who had developed islet autoantibodies had
more CVB infections. Viral infection can impact beta cells through a direct cytolytic effect or by bystander
activation of the immune system leading to gradual destruction. However, there is still little direct causal evidence
from human pancreata that would establish a link between viral infections and T1D development. Although
mouse studies have been very useful in understanding some of the mechanisms of the disease, there remain
substantial gaps and differences to human pathology. Therefore, studies on Human pancreatic tissue samples
become essential. Pancreas tissue slices are 150-200 µm thick sections of living human donor pancreatic tissue.
They enable functional analysis of intact islets in their endogenous environment and 3D morphological
assessment of the endocrine and exocrine pancreas as well as the blood vasculature, neurons and tissue
resident immune cells. In preliminary studies, we have been able to culture and infect Human pancreatic slices
using coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-GFP and identify the beta cells and tissue-resident macrophages as targets.
Thus, we hypothesize that virus infections induce changes in tissue-resident macrophages which then induce T
cells to attack and destroy beta cells. Aim 1 will evaluate the impact of CVB3-GFP infection on beta cells
function and viability. Aim 2 will characterize tissue-resident macrophages during CVB3 infection by single cell
RNA-seq. Aim 3 will examinate if the infection could lead to an immune destruction of beta cells when cocultured
with HLA matched or autologous PBMCs. Aim 4 will characterize the impact of CVB3 infection on autophagy
in infected Human pancreatic slices. Overall, this effort will generate a better understanding of the consequences
of viral infections in the pancreas and its role in the onset of T1D."
10862654,"ABSTRACT
Significant transitions at midlife can be positive for some, but many also experience emotional challenges,
physical health declines, and high stress in adapting to new social roles. Yet, health and functioning at midlife
have received less attention compared to older ages because disease and disability remain relatively rare. This
combination of growing health challenges and low rates of disability points to opportunities for intervention to
prevent and delay more serious illness and impairment. This study addresses important gaps in knowledge to
better capitalize on these opportunities. Little is known about how midlife may be different for those now in their
40s and 50s—often labeled Generation X—who are much more diverse demographically and in their family
formation and education/career paths than prior generations. Most existing midlife research has also focused
on relatively narrow health outcomes with little consideration of the interplay of physical and mental health and
functioning in work and civic life. Recent studies showing significant health declines in new midlife cohorts
additionally underscore the need for a focus on disparities and sociodemographic differences in midlife health
and mechanisms to explain them, particularly increasing alcohol misuse and its central role in midlife health
risks. This study brings strengths to examining these issues by drawing on existing longitudinal data from the
Seattle Social Development Project (SSDP) and collecting new data in early midlife. SSDP has followed a
gender-balanced, multiethnic, and socioeconomically diverse panel of 808 participants across 15 waves from
age 10 to 39 with high retention. Data include theory-guided assessments of the social environment
throughout; unique longitudinal assessments of neighborhood environments that integrate self-report, Census,
and GIS measures; and longitudinal measures of alcohol and other substance use and disorder, mental and
physical health, and functioning in work, community, and civic life. New data augment and extend existing
measures into midlife and enable the examination of midlife-specific experiences. The study aims are to
examine (1) how sociodemographic statuses and transitions among those now entering midlife influence
comorbid health outcomes in early midlife; (2) how alcohol use, misuse and related behaviors during midlife
influence midlife health, as well as the influence of life course trajectories of alcohol use and misuse leading up
to midlife; (3) how malleable social and neighborhood environmental factors influence alcohol use and misuse
over the life course and, in turn, affect midlife health; and to (4a) examine the long-term malleability of social
environmental factors from early adolescence to midlife by testing the mechanisms of a childhood intervention
(embedded in the existing study); and (4b) identify promising adult intervention targets by conducting focus
groups with participants to help design and tailor prevention programs. With guidance from empirical findings
and participants themselves, the goal of the study is to provide researchers and health practitioners with
specific recommendations for preventive interventions addressing public health priorities for midlife adults."

Alcohol dependence is an independent risk factor for sepsis-mortality but the mechanisms are unknown. The
goal of this proposal is to fill this gap and investigate potential targeted treatment. Ethanol represses immune
response and increases mortality in mouse model of sepsis. Sepsis kills over 250,000 patients annually and is
the most expensive condition in the US. Immune response in sepsis transitions from early/ hyper-inflammatory-
to a late/hypo-inflammatory and immunosuppressive phase; majority of the sepsis-mortality occurs during
hypo-inflammation with inability to clear pathogen. Leukocyte adhesion prior to extravasation and pathogen
clearance, is a rate determining factor in inflammation. Using in vivo leukocyte adhesion to test microvascular
inflammatory response in mice and cell models, we reported, sirtuins (SIRTs), the known anti-inflammatory
proteins, are crucial for transition to hypo-inflammation. Specifically, we reported a crucial role for sirtuin 2
(SIRT2) in sepsis. SIRT2 expression is decreased during hyper- and induced during hypo-inflammation in obese-
sepsis mice. Our strong preliminary data suggests that ethanol induces early and sustained SIRT2 expression,
represses microvascular leukocyte adhesion in vivo, impairs bacterial clearance and decreases survival in sepsis-
mice. In contrast, ethanol with sepsis in SIRT2 deficient mice show significantly improved leukocyte adhesion
response, bacterial clearance and increased survival. We identified SIRT2 coupling with p38 MAPK activation
and IL-10 expression in ethanol with sepsis. We also found, mitochondrial accumulation of SIRT2 was
accompanied by impaired mitochondrial function and glycolysis. Our overarching goal is to study immuno-
metabolic dysfunction in ethanol with sepsis. We will study the hypothesis that ethanol causes immuno-
metabolic dysfunction in sepsis via SIRT2-p38 MAPK- IL-10 pathway, in two complimentary but independent
specific aims:
Aim 1: To determine the effect of ethanol on immuno-metabolic function in sepsis.
Aim 2: To determine the role of SIRT2 in immuno-metabolic dysfunction in ethanol with sepsis.
Successful completion of these experiments will inform the role of SIRT2 in immuno-metabolic dysfunction with
alcohol drinking and potentially lead to new SIRT2-based therapeutic targets with wide-ranging applications to
treat acute/chronic inflammatory conditions."
10918054,"Biochemistry in situ to determine inheritance of RNA-protein complexes
The long-term goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms how macromolecular RNA-protein complexes
transmit information to future generations of cells and progeny. We classically think of DNA and DNA
modifications as the only information inherited between cells. Recent work demonstrates that RNA and RNA-
binding proteins are also inherited and that these proteins have functions in organism development and
immunity. My lab aims to identify which RNA binding proteins are inherited, determine the macromolecular
organization of inherited RNA-protein complexes, and discover the molecular purpose of inheriting these protein
complexes. This interest in inherited RNA binding proteins currently extends to investigating RNA-protein
complexes that form multi-component RNA-protein granules, or biomolecular condensates. Much of my previous
work centered on characterizing the structural organization of P granules, an inherited RNA-protein granule
necessary for C. elegans nematode germ cell development. The next five years will focus on understanding the
molecular mechanisms how RNA-protein complexes are inherited across cell generations and from parent to
progeny. Which RNA binding proteins are inherited, and which cells inherit these proteins? What protein
attributes are required for inheritance? Our ability to investigate these questions is currently limited by available
methods to track protein components in multicellular organisms. My lab seeks to label and follow maternal
proteins in the authentic germline tissue of C. elegans, a proven model organism to study basic questions in
animal development. Established single gene editing methods, robust imaging capabilities, and short
generational time make C. elegans an ideal multicellular animal to identify the functions of maternal proteins
inherited across generations. Modified enzyme tags now allow us to pulse label proteins with covalently bound
ligands and chase these labeled proteins over time. This in vivo pulse-chase method has been used to follow
chromatin remodeling in cell culture and protein stability in mouse tumors. Our preliminary results demonstrate
that we are able to use in vivo pulse chase to track histone protein stability in worm germline tissue under different
nutrient conditions. The current goal is to use in vivo pulse chase in C. elegans to visualize the stability of
maternal germline RNA binding proteins through germ cell development and track these proteins as they are
inherited from mother to progeny. First, we will pulse-label a P granule assembly protein and test how granule
formation and protein quantity affect its inheritance. Second, we will pulse-chase maternal germline Argonautes,
a family of RNA regulatory enzymes, to identify which Argonautes are inherited by progeny, what tissues inherit
them, and what protein attributes are necessary for tissue-specific inheritance. Collectively, this work will redefine
our concept of maternal inheritance and elucidate criteria for the inheritance of specific RNA binding proteins. In
vivo pulse-chase in C. elegans will provide a foundation to discover novel maternally inherited proteins
associated with gene regulation for development, immunity, and beyond.

11100968,"Improving the health outcomes for infants and children has been a national priority in the United States
(US) for over a century. Despite great strides in improving perinatal health care and utilization among American
women, key perinatal indicators have remained stagnant or worsened, the US continues to rank near the bottom,
and racial disparities are persistent. While studies now have gone beyond behavioral and biomedical
determinants of health and encompass the social environment, most research still remains focused on the time
shortly before or during the pregnancy Improvements in perinatal health will require utilization of frameworks
which integrate life-course and multiple-determinant models of health.
 Though the body of evidence linking the prenatal social environment, particularly maternal stress, and
epigenome is growing, little work has yet explored the life course antecedents to the prenatal social environment
and the impact on epigenetic methylation or telomere length. Based on our widely embraced framework for
perinatal health that marries a multiple determinants model with a life course approach, we will investigate
maternal social environmental influences on maternal methylation and telomere length. Change as well as
critical periods will be assessed as the maternal social environment over the maternal life course may
independently, cumulatively, and interactively impact the maternal epigenomic profile and its changes over the
life course. Archived newborn blood spots, available for all pregnant women in this unique cohort of Black births
in metro Detroit, will be assayed to determine the presence of epigenetic methylation and telomere length of
mothers at their own birth; maternal measures at the index pregnancy will be derived from analogous blood spots
collected in our study. Neighborhood level data will utilize both administrative and subjective measures of
neighborhood. In addition to determining associations between the maternal social environment and her
epigenomic features across her life course, we will endeavor to explore potential pathways linking the social
environment and epigenome across the maternal life course with the perinatal outcomes of her offspring.
 Researchers have recently begun to consider social environmental factors and how they relate to
epigenomic features as well as adverse perinatal outcomes. Yet those populations disproportionately affected
by these outcomes are grossly underrepresented in genomic studies. Our sample of 1,000 births to Black
women, with nearly half expected to women residing in Detroit, will provide a rich source of data on the maternal
social environment across the life course and the epigenome. Our team possesses tremendous expertise in the
study of perinatal outcomes as well as measures of social environmental factors often overlooked or not modeled
in such a way as to provide understanding of mechanisms. Our study will substantially increase evidence about
the importance of the maternal social context at multiple points in the life course on her epigenome and birth
outcomes in offspring. The work holds promise for significantly increasing understanding about how social factors
have influence across generations through epigenetic processes."

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represent an extraordinary global crisis. Over three quarters of all NCD
related deaths and 82% of premature NCD-related deaths occur in low-middle income countries (LMIC).
Locally-relevant, high-quality data regarding NCDs are scarce and most low-middle income countries (LMICs)
like Pakistan, are not equipped to manage this epidemic. A critical gap in the response of LMICs to the NCD
epidemic is a dearth of trained researchers who can contribute to the understanding of prevalence, risk factors,
and development and testing of safe, effective, and low-cost solutions. Our prior work funded through the D71
PAR-17-097 mechanism in 2018, shows that there exists a pressing local and national need and desire for
high-quality, multidisciplinary, trained professionals to lead teams that are thematically focused on NCD
research in Pakistan. We were able to identify high-priority NCD research themes and most suitable research
training resources and pathways. Informed by these unique insights we have designed a comprehensive,
integrated, multi-disciplinary training program to train the next generation of leaders in NCD research with a
particular focus on cardio-cerebrovascular diseases and their shared risk factors. The training program
leverages the Aga Khan University’s (AKU) and the Institute for Global Health and Development extensive
development network platform and infrastructure at its flagship site in Pakistan. The specific aims of this
program are to: 1) Build sustainable research capacity in: (a) high-quality surveillance of risk factors (including
social determinants) across the life span common to several NCDs, (b) implementation of context sensitive,
scalable, approaches to cardio-cerebro vascular diseases prevention & management in Pakistan. A heavy
focus will be research approaches that leverage digital information technology including big data and m-health.
2) Develop a sustainable pool of Pakistani research experts in cardio-neurovascular disease surveillance and
implementation science who will provide the vision and leadership necessary to produce high-quality research
of relevance to tackling NCDs in Pakistan and other LMICs. The proposed program brings together faculty,
research expertise, and resources from the Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan and Duke University,
United States. We expect that this program will directly increase Pakistan’s research capacity, a critical
element in a comprehensive national NCD response.

10913481,"Project Summary
Living-donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) is the optimal treatment for end-stage kidney disease to increase
length and quality of life, yet it is vastly underutilized, putting thousands of transplant candidates at
unnecessary risk for premature death. Evidence indicates that transplant candidates need better access to
evidence-based education and outreach tools to overcome their substantial informational barriers and help
identify and recruit live donors from their social networks. The long-term goal is to devise an educational
strategy to increase access to LDKT and, in doing so, reduce kidney disease-related morbidity and mortality.
The objective of this R01 application is to increase receptivity to LDKT among transplant candidates through a
web-based educational intervention (KidneyTIME) previously developed by the Co-PIs. Although the proposed
intervention is evidence-informed and promising, it needs to be effectiveness-tested compared with a control
condition prior to larger-scale evaluation. Our central hypothesis is that transplant candidates will most often
engage their social networks with information about LDKT when presented with the KidneyTIME educational
intervention. The research study will pursue 3 specific aims: (1) determine the effects of KidneyTIME compared
to Usual Care to improve transplant candidate LDKT knowledge, attitudes, and outreach behaviors, (2)
evaluate the effects of KidneyTIME compared to Usual Care on potential live donor inquiries to donate, and (3)
identify and compare the effects of KidneyTIME versus Usual Care on activation of perceived social support
among transplant candidates when considering LDKT. For the first aim, validated survey measures will assess
LDKT knowledge, concerns, readiness, communication self-efficacy, and outreach behaviors immediately and
at 2-weeks, 6-months, and 12-months post-exposure. For the second aim, estimates of living donor inquiries at
12-months post-baseline will be obtained. For the third aim, multivariate regression models that assess
perceived social support simultaneously will explore optimal intervention components, dosage, moderators,
and interactions on live donor inquiries, and an embedded qualitative process evaluation will be used to
examine intervention sustainability, extent to which it is contextually situated, and potential refinements to the
intervention. The proposed research is innovative in that it shifts the current paradigm of intervention research
to increase access to LDKT from a primary reliance on synchronous education to transplant candidates
towards an asynchronous learning approach that facilitates education of others about LDKT. The proposed
research is significant in providing web-based education that activates social network outreach—an approach
that ultimately may be necessary to increase access to LDKT. Our expected outcome is knowledge of how to
effectively reach candidates and their social network with education about LDKT to increase access to LDKT.
The proposed research is relevant to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases’
mission to conduct and fund research on kidney diseases to improve people’s health and quality of life."
10894108,"Formation of functional neural circuits depends on the proper generation of different
neuronal and glial cell types in the correct numbers and order. In the developing
mammalian central nervous system, multipotent neural stem cells initially produce
neurons, followed by glia. The cerebral cortex is the brain region that best exemplifies this
developmental theme. In the developing cortex, multipotent neural stem cells, known as
the radial glial cells (RGCs), sequentially generate the diverse cortical excitatory neuronal
subtypes that populate different cortical layers. At the end of cortical neurogenesis, the
RGCs switch lineages and generate inhibitory olfactory bulb interneurons, and both types
of cortical macroglia. The cellular process and molecular mechanisms that underlie this
lineage switch is not known. Lack of this knowledge hinders our effort to understand the
etiology of various neurodevelopmental disorders. In this grant application, we propose to
determine the lineage segregation patterns among OB interneuron, astrocyte and
oligodendrocyte lineages (Aim 1), to investigate whether Shh signaling regulates lineage
specification of cortical astrocytes (Aim 2), and to uncover the underlying molecular
mechanisms underlying the lineage switch of cortical RGCs (Aims 2 and 3). We will
combine mouse genetics, MADM and intersectional lineage analyses, RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN, ATAC-seq, and 4C technologies to achieve these
goals."

Program ARISE (African mental health Researchers InSpired and Equipped) responds to PAR
18-901, and is led by the Alan J. Flisher Centre for Public Mental Health at the University of
Cape Town in collaboration with the Department of Psychology at Stellenbosch University.
This application builds on the findings and work conducted during a D71 planning grant .The
aim of the project is to strengthen and extend the postgraduate pipeline in African public
mental health to build capacity for non-communicable disease research across the lifespan,
building on the extensive capacity-building experience of CPMH and our African network. The
objectives of the ARISE program are:
1. To deliver and evaluate a distance postgraduate diploma in public mental health in Africa.
2. To train Masters and PhD students to conduct public mental health research relevant to
 their setting, with a focus on the integration of mental healthcare into routine care for NCDs
 and infectious diseases, and into community responses to public health threats, such as
 the COVID-19 pandemic.
3. To strengthen distance learning, teaching and mentoring skills, and postgraduate student
 supervision teamwork and capacity within a regional African network of institutions.
4. To implement and evaluate short courses in implementation and policy research for
 policymakers, NGOs and academics from diverse disciplines.
 On completion of the grant, we will have a well-functioning distance learning PGDip
platform and program attracting applications from self-funded candidates in addition to those
funded through other mechanisms. We expect to have trained 30 PGDip, 4 Masters and 2
PhD trainees, and at least 8 PGDip graduates would have enrolled for a Masters degree. We
anticipate that the Masters and PhD graduates will continue to be involved in public mental
health research, and will be mentoring and supervising postgraduate trainees. We will have
trained 20 faculty members across our regional network in remote teaching and postgraduate
student supervision and we expect that the early career faculty members will be supervising
at least one postgraduate student each as a primary supervisor. We would have trained 40

Center for Live Cell Genomics
We will build new methodology and capacity for large-scale, long-term, inexpensive, modular,
customizable, shared, Internet-of-Things-controlled, reproducible live cell culture and tissue-based
experimental genomics disease models. Tissue models include traditional cell culture as well as
organoid and primary tissue explants obtained from surgery or biopsy. Organoid factories supporting
tissue growth and maintenance will be integrated with external and on-chip electro-optofluidic analytical
modules to become part of an ecosystem that is modeled after open-source software. It will use
commodity sensors, cameras, and computers linked in platforms flexibly designed using simple 3D
printing, molding, etching and milling techniques potentially available at any institution. This will
stimulate rapid innovation in experimental platforms for tissue culture.
We will push this technology and use its best-in-class capabilities to make progress in
neurodevelopment and pediatric cancer, addressing big questions. What genes contribute most
importantly and specifically to human brain development? How do they go wrong in
neurodevelopmental disease or brain injury? What specific molecular pathways are disrupted in
individual pediatric cancer cases? How can we test pathway-specific treatments in a tissue model
specific to each patient?
Our education and outreach plans include a training program to develop a diverse and inclusive cohort
of undergraduate students trained in genomic science through secondary school and community
college outreach as well as coding workshops and research-based laboratory classes for UCSC
undergraduates to develop core competencies. Participation in these activities serve as a basis for
training graduate students and postdocs in inclusive pedagogy and mentorship. We are also developing
a one-stop information hub to form an online community and to share our technology through
immersive webinars and tutorials aimed at a broader audience with a range of expertise from the
general public to scientists and clinicians at research institutions.
Our work will enable significant advances in neuroscience and cancer research and education,
stimulate a new open-source culture in cell biology and genomics, and democratize scientific and
educational access beyond elite institutions, extending sharing projects like NHGRI ANvIL beyond data
and code to include experiments and Internet-connected experimental platforms."

This project aims to mechanistically understand and combat pathological mechanisms activated by SARS-
CoV-2 in the lungs and heart. We will further investigate whether these mechanisms are altered in specific
immunodeficiencies linked to severe COVID-19. Our work will leverage major discoveries made by our group,
including that the non-canonical inflammasome protein Caspase-11 (CASP11, homologous to CASP4 in
humans) promotes pathological inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that CASP11 KO mice experience
significantly less severe infections than than WT mice. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that cell-specific
roles of CASP11 mediate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis by examining infections of cell-specific CASP11 KO mice
(CASP11 flox allele mice). Further, we will target CASP11 downstream effectors identified by our work, such
as the chemokine CXCL1 and recruited neutrophils, to determine their roles in unique aspects of SARS-CoV-2
pathogenesis. We will examine additional emergent candidate CASP11-dependent molecules, using genetic,
neutralizing antibody, and chemical inhibitor strategies. This aim will yield new understanding of roles for
CASP11 in specific cell types and will identify tailored strategies for preventing or treating unique aspects of
COVID-19 pathology. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CASP11-dependent mechanisms of
pathogenesis are exacerbated in specific immunodeficiencies linked to severe COVID-19. These include type I
interferon (IFN) and IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) deficiencies. We have shown IFN alpha
receptor KO and IFITM3 KO mice model these deficiencies, including exacerbated lung infections and virus
dissemination to the heart. The use of these models in combination with CASP11 KOs will allow identification
of pathogenic mechanisms in the lungs, and in the hearts of mice with or without direct cardiac tissue infection.
Overall, our work will reveal fundamental mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in the lungs and heart,
including involvement of specific cell types, pathways, and molecules, thus revealing targetable therapeutic
strategies for combating COVID-19 in immunocompetent, as well as highly vulnerable, populations."
10827506,"Ultrasound-guided Ultra-steerable Histotripsy Array System for Non-invasive treatment of Soft Tissue
Sarcoma
Summary
The goal of this project is to develop a novel ultra-steerable histotripsy array system for non-invasive treatment
of soft tissue sarcomas (STS). STS are malignant tumors that grow in soft tissues like fat, muscle, cartilage,
fibrous tissues, blood vessels, or subcutaneous tissues. The American Cancer Society reports 13,190 new cases
and 5,130 deaths of STS annually in the US. Surgery is the first-line treatment for STS. However, when STS
encompass or grow near critical structures (e.g., major nerves, blood vessels, and bones), surgical resection is
particularly challenging and sometimes these cancers are deemed unresectable. Radiation, chemotherapy, and
minimally invasive or non-invasive ablation methods are not effective for STS treatment or have major drawbacks,
such that they have very limited use in STS therapy. Histotripsy is a non-invasive ultrasound therapy that
mechanically liquefies the target tissue to acellular debris via controlled cavitation. Histotripsy is well-suited for
STS treatment because it can debulk and shrink the tumor non-invasively while sparing critical structures, such
as major vessels, nerves, and bones. Histotripsy can be used for non-invasive debulking of STS to facilitate or
potentially replace surgery. Even though histotripsy has been investigated for the treatment of various tumor
types, STS treatment presents unique challenges. 1) STS can grow significantly larger than other types of tumors
(>10 cm or >400mL), requiring very fast treatment speed. 2) STS often grow near critical structures and/or close
to the skin surface. Treatment strategies need to be developed to avoid damage to critical structures and the
skin. 3) Histotripsy treatment is typically guided by 2D B-mode ultrasound imaging, but fast treatment of a large
STS requires 3D monitoring capabilities. In this proposal, we will develop a novel ultra-steerable histotripsy
phased array system with 3D cavitation monitoring capabilities and special strategies for ultra-fast STS ablation
and safe treatment near the skin surface and critical structures. We propose the following three specific aims.
Aim 1: To design and construct an integrated histotripsy STS system, consisting of an ultra-steerable histotripsy
phased array with transmit-receive capability for 3D cavitation monitoring, ultrasound image guidance, robotic
arm assistance, and acoustic coupling. Aim 2: To optimize histotripsy parameters for fast (>10 mL/min) and safe
treatment near the skin surface and critical structures and test in ex vivo tissue and excised human and canine
STS samples of different histological subtypes. Aim 3: To test the in vivo safety and efficacy of the integrated
histotripsy STS system (Aim 1) and optimized parameters for fast and safe treatment near the skin and critical
structures (Aim 2) in canine STS patients at the Virginia Tech Animal Cancer Care and Research Center. This
project will result in a human prototype histotripsy system with unique treatment and monitoring capabilities as
well as parameters optimized for STS therapy. Canine patients are the best large animal model to test the safety
and efficacy of histotripsy STS treatment to accelerate the clinical translation, and the veterinary treatment is
another application for histotripsy STS therapy before the FDA approval of human use."
10832533,"Background: Delays in care (i.e., poor access to timely care) are associated with adverse impacts on
morbidity, mortality and quality of life, as well as poor outcomes from physical and mental health conditions.
The VHA healthcare system has long struggled with access issues, however, VHA's “access crisis” in 2014,
where systemic access problems were identified after whistleblowers revealed intentional cover-ups of long
delays, drew particular outrage as evidence emerged that Veterans had died waiting to see their VHA doctors.
Improving Veterans' access to care continues to be among VHA's top priorities, and while expansion of access
to community providers has been among the most visible approaches to reducing waits and delays, VHA has
implemented numerous initiatives to improve Veterans' timely access to care within VHA as well. These
include development of a group practice manager role to facilitate face-to-face and virtual appointment-making
through call centers and access management tools (e.g., grid validation). Improving access management—
effectively deploying clinic personnel, resources, and processes to achieve timely access—remains a major
challenge nonetheless, especially across widely varying organizational and geographic contexts. Despite their
importance, remarkably little is known about which of these strategies have been implemented, the factors that
support or hinder their use, or their relationship to access metrics.
Specific Aims: To address these gaps, we propose the following specific aims:
Aim 1: To assess national variations in how local VA facilities manage primary care access.
Aim 2: To evaluate how different access management strategies relate to access metrics.
Aim 3: Building on results from Aims 1 and 2, to conduct a national expert panel to come to consensus on
evidence-based practice and policy recommendations to improve access to care.
Methods: For Aim 1, we propose to use key informant-based organizational surveys to assess implementation
of access management strategies on a national basis. We will examine area and organizational determinants
of their uptake, use and implementation by linking resulting survey data with Area Resource File measures
(e.g., urban/rural, primary care shortage area), facility characteristics (e.g., complexity, academic affiliation),
and other organizational measures (e.g., PACT Implementation Index). For Aim 2, we will then link data from
Aim 1 to VHA access metrics, including both administrative (e.g., appointment wait times) and patient-reported
access measures (e.g., obtained care when needed). For Aim 3, we will use modified Delphi panel techniques
to bring together VA and non-VA experts in access management, primary care, care coordination and other
areas to generate evidence-based recommendations based on data from Aims 1 and 2.
Anticipated Impacts on Veterans' Healthcare: The proposed study will provide critical information for VA
leadership to better understand which access management strategies have been implemented, what has
driven uptake and implementation, the barriers and facilitators to their use, and which of them are in fact
associated with better performance on access metrics. No other data sources are available to lay the
groundwork for evidence-based approaches to solving VHA's access crisis on this scale despite the resources
being applied. This study will yield multilevel targets for intervention and implementation in partnership with
senior leaders and other stakeholders.
Next Steps: We will work with leaders in Primary Care and Office of Veterans' Access to Care to disseminate
findings to the field. During the Expert Panel, we will confer with panelists to identify optimal means of
communication, including but not limited to issues briefs, toolkits, field guides, workgroups or other methods."
10876915,"Support is requested to continue a successful cancer research training program at the University of
California, Irvine (UCI). This newly renamed Training Program for Interdisciplinary Cancer Research (IDCR)
builds on a foundation of more than 40 years of experience developing PhD students and postdoctoral
fellows to become scientific leaders. As the nature of cancer research and treatment have evolved, so has
the focus of our training program. We emphasize interdisciplinary approaches to advance knowledge in
cancer biology and treatment, offering trainees a highly collaborative environment that includes faculty
mentors from five different Schools at UCI. Coursework emphasizes critical analysis of research literature in
cancer and related disciplines, the most current research methods, and a focus on translational science such
as the development of therapeutics and diagnostics. The scientific foundation we provide together with
professional development activities offered will produce a cohort of well-trained experts armed to
successfully attack the cancer problem from vantage points in both academia and industry. The Program
benefits from outstanding institutional support from the UCI Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (a
NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center), the UCI Cancer Research Institute, Graduate Division, and
other campus offices. The Program provides research opportunities across the cancer continuum from
etiology to therapeutics, encompassing faculty from the Schools of Biological Sciences, Medicine, Pharmacy
and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Engineering. There are thirty training faculty, each
with a cancer-focused research program and extramural funding. We request support for four postdoctoral
and four predoctoral trainees; one additional predoctoral position will be supported by our Graduate Division.
The Program is led two co-Directors, both senior faculty with outstanding records of research productivity
and training, and a history of collaboration. In preparation for this renewal application, we have carried out a
rigorous self-evaluation with input from trainees, faculty, and externaladvisors. This process has led us to
implement a revised program that meets the specific needs of current UCI trainees. A continuing element of
the Program will be a rigorous and well-defined set of courses (“Cancer Biology parts A and B”, ""Clinical
Cancer for Basic Scientists"") that build knowledge about basic and clinical/translational cancer research.
Other strong components that will continue are the biannual program retreat, the annual symposium in basic
cancer research, and access to exceptional professional development opportunities (established under a
NIH-BEST award and continuing with campus support). A fundamental change will be to redesign our journal
clubs and research-in-progress talks to maximize interaction with diverse training faculty and expand active
learning of interdisciplinary cancer research approaches. We will also implement several changes in program
administration to increase faculty participation and to optimize mentoring, evaluation, and recruitment."
10876471,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of the proposed research is to understand the role of Twist1 in cutaneous squamous cell
carcinoma (cSCC) and to develop novel approaches for targeting Twist1 for prevention and treatment of this
important disease. Twist1 is a transcription factor involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer
progression and metastasis in a number of epithelial cancers. In previous studies from our laboratory, we found
that Twist1 was required for proliferation of keratinocytes during the process of skin tumor promotion by TPA
suggesting a role early in the process of skin carcinogenesis in addition to its role in cancer progression and
metastasis. These earlier studies showed that Twist1 regulated levels of G1-S-phase cell cycle proteins.
Furthermore, Twist1 was shown to regulate the function of p53 and p21. To date, the impact of Twist1 on UV
skin carcinogenesis has not been studied and therefore it is important to demonstrate that Twist1 also plays
critical role in UV skin carcinogenesis. In new preliminary experiments, we have found that deletion of Twist1 in
keratinocytes leads to keratinocyte differentiation. Furthermore, deletion of Twist1 in basal keratinocytes of
mouse epidermis in vivo leads to changes in bulge-region keratinocyte stem cells (KSCs), including migration of
KSCs out of the bulge region. These findings suggest that Twist1 may play an important role in regulating
keratinocyte differentiation and be required for KSC homeostasis. In additional preliminary experiments, we have
found that Ovol1 expression is significantly upregulated in Twist1 deficient keratinocytes and may be responsible
for driving differentiation. Furthermore, we have also found that Harmine, a naturally occurring compound
reported to inhibit Twist1 by facilitating its degradation, induces differentiation in keratinocytes and upregulates
Ovol1 in a manner similar to that seen in epidermis of Twist1 KO mice. In this proposal, we will test the
hypothesis that Twist1 plays a critical role in UV-induced cSCC by maintaining the balance between
proliferation and differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes, including KSCs via regulation of the levels of
Ovol1 and that targeting Twist1 will effectively inhibit UV-induced cSCC. The specific aims are as follows: i)
To further examine the role of Twist1 in regulating proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes and KSCs; ii)
To examine the impact of keratinocyte specific deletion of Twist1 on UV-induced skin carcinogenesis; iii)
Determine the role of Ovol1 as a downstream effector of Twist1 in regulating proliferation and differentiation of
keratinocytes and KSCsand iv) Further evaluate the ability of Harmine, a novel Twist1 inhibitor, to prevent UV-
induced skin carcinogenesis. Completion of the proposed studies will further elucidate the role of Twist1 in
keratinocyte and KSC proliferation and differentiation and its role in development of cSCC, especially in the early
stages of skin tumor development. Identification of Twist1 as a key early player in skin cancer development could
lead to novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of cSCC. Development of novel agents for prevention
and/or treatment as proposed in this grant application could lead to rapid translation of such agents into the clinic."
10848482,"Our sense of touch enables numerous behaviors fundamental to human existence, allowing us to eat,
communicate and survive. Deficits in tactile responsiveness are thought to contribute to the decline of postural
stability and hand grip, and the resulting increase in falling frequency, which is a major factor determining
quality of life and the ability to live independently for the elderly. In mammals, different tactile qualities
(curvature, texture and vibration) are encoded by touch receptors residing in the skin with distinct physiological
properties and morphological end-organs; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this
diversity are largely unknown. Furthermore, the regulation of skin stem cells that are responsible for
maintaining the turnover of cellular mechanoreceptors that perceive gentle touch, such as Merkel cells, is
unknown. Our laboratory previously characterized a population of epithelial stem cells that reside in epidermal
touch domes in the skin, termed touch dome stem cells (TDSCs), that are responsible for maintaining the
Merkel lineage during homeostasis. The long-term goal of this proposal is to define the cellular and molecular
basis for TDSC maintenance of the Merkel lineage. Our preliminary data chronicles a dramatic age-related
decline in Merkel cell numbers in human (40 – 90 years of age) and murine (2 – 32 months of age) skin.
However, TDSC numbers remain unchanged. We confirmed that age-related loss of Merkel cells is not due to
precocious exit of mature Merkel cells or defects in sensory afferent innervation but is due to diminished TDSC
progenitor capacity to replenish the Merkel lineage. Leveraging this age-related deficit in TDSC progenitor
capacity, we performed proteomics and mRNA profiling of TDSCs from young versus aged mouse skin and
identified the focal adhesion-associated protein Utrophin (Utrn) to be dramatically downregulated in aged
TDSCs. Utrn null (Utrn-/-) mice at postnatal day 20 displayed equal numbers of Merkel cells compared to Wt
mice, excluding a role for Utrn in Merkel cell development. However, Merkel cell numbers were reduced by
50% in 2-month-old Utrn-/- mice providing genetic evidence for a functional role for Utrn in age-related
maintenance of the Merkel lineage by TDSCs. We identified the Nrg1-Erbb2 signaling axis as a regulator of
Utrn expression in mouse and human epithelial keratinocytes in vitro and TDSCs in vivo. These preliminary
findings support our central hypothesis: Nrg1-Erbb2 regulation of Utrn expression is required for TDSC
maintenance of Merkel cell homeostasis. To test our hypothesis, we will employ mouse models to genetically
disrupt or rescue Utrn expression and assess its impact on Merkel cell homeostasis. Using in vivo lineage
tracing tools and a Nrg1 conditional allele we will investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying TDSC
maintenance of the Merkel lineage and upstream regulation of Nrg1 expression in the TD niche. Finally, we will
interrogate the molecular mechanisms for Utrn regulation and downstream effectors of Utrn function in TDSCs.
Our goal is to uncover first of its kind genetic mechanisms for stem cell regulation of the Merkel lineage."
10873940,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Periodontal disease (PD) affects approximately 50% of the world population. Microbial dysbiosis and gingival
inflammation are well-recognized in PD. However, the role of diet on these parameters is minimally explored.
Increased PD incidence coincides with the adoption of the western diet that is characterized by consumption of
highly processed, refined grains. Grain processing alters both nutritional and structural properties of grains via
removal of the outer bran layer to isolate inner starch-rich components. This disrupts the integrity of the grain
structure, resulting in increased starch bioavailability and finer grain texture. Refined grain consumption is
associated with increased incidence of PD. However, the mechanisms by which refined grains increase PD
incidence are unexplored. Digestion commences in the oral phase via starch hydrolysis by salivary amylase and
mechanical digestion by mastication. Saccharides are made available to bacteria in the oral cavity via starch
hydrolysis by salivary amylase. Increased saccharide availability alters microbial carbohydrate metabolism,
driving microbial dysbiosis within dentogingival biofilm communities. Dentogingival surfaces provide an
opportunity for mature microbial biofilm formation. Excess biofilm formation drives dysbiosis as successional
colonization increases the representation of periodontal pathogens within the community. As such, mechanical
debridement is required to disrupt biofilm formation. Increased diet texture has been shown to decrease biofilm
accumulation. Moreover, increased masticatory forces by hard diets induce a protective inflammatory response
in gingival tissues, consistent with the role of the gingiva as a physiological barrier. As grain processing increases
starch bioavailability and its susceptibility to salivary amylase, this may increase saccharide availability to
bacteria in the oral cavity and encourage dysbiosis. Moreover, as grain processing disrupts the integrity of the
grain structure, such changes may reduce masticatory forces and thereby encourage excess microbial
colonization and reduce gingival barrier function. Therefore, I hypothesize that processed grains induce PD
progression by promoting microbial dysbiosis and/or by conferring reduced gingival barrier function via
local influences within the oral cavity. This proposal will address my hypothesis via two specific aims: 1)
Determine the impact of processed grains on development of multispecies dentogingival biofilms in vitro, and 2)
Determine the impact of processed grains on the dentogingival microbiome, periodontal immune response, and
gingival barrier function in vivo. These aims will be achieved utilizing a combination of in vitro and in vivo models
to recapitulate changes in the dentogingival microbiome and periodontal immunity in response to processed
grain consumption. Outcomes from this investigation will improve the understanding of the role of diet in PD
progression and will create avenues for the development of novel therapeutic applications that leverage the oral
microbiome for prevention of PD onset and progression."
10883586,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bladder reconstruction (BR) is essential to restore urinary function in patients with neurogenic bladder,
congenital disorders, and as sequalae to the surgical treatment of bladder or pelvic malignancies. The current
standard of care is to use the patient's own intestinal tissue (ileal segment; IS) as graft material during BR to
create a neobladder or urinary diversion. While IS grafts are non-immunogenic and readily available, post-
surgical persistence of intestinal cells in the graft impedes regeneration into bladder wall, resulting in stone
formation, metabolic acidosis and risk of secondary cancers. Our objective is to develop new technology for
intrasurgical tissue engineering of the IS by knockdown of cellular components using irreversible
electroporation (IRE) and identify factors fundamental for regeneration of functional bladder wall. IRE is used in
patients for tumor ablation by inducing cell death with ultrashort electric pulses. Our proposed strategy builds
upon our preliminary data showing (i) IRE can knockdown intestinal cells in an IS graft, aiding repopulation
with urothelium in a rat model of BR, (ii) feasibility of new pulse application strategies for the focal knockdown
of mucosa, or decellularization while preserving vasculature and ECM in the IS, and (iii) phenotypic changes in
IRE treated IS following urothelialization, that were not observed in sham controls under physiologic conditions
of bladder filling and voiding. In specific aim 1, we will Define the impact of graft perfusion on bladder wall
regeneration by performing vasculature sparing IRE of the IS. In specific aim 2, Elucidate the role of IS
mucosa in post-BR complications by knockdown with IRE. In specific aim 3, Investigate the role of
mechanotransduction in bladder function development in IRE treated IS. Intrasurgical creation of a perfused,
histocompatible graft (Aim 1) and focal decellularization of the mucosa while sparing the underlying layers in
the IS (Aim 2) are the first examples of in vivo knockdown tissue engineering using IRE. The study and
application of mechanotransduction principles to augment urinary barrier function development in IS grafts
(Aim 3) is previously undescribed. Knowledge gained from proposed research will yield a simple intrasurgical
technique (mt-IRE or vs-IRE) that combines technology (IRE) and grafting technique (with IS) that are already
in the clinic, enabling rapid translation for the immediate benefit of patients undergoing BR. Eventually, we
anticipate our work to advance the concept of in vivo production of functionalized grafts using the patient as the
source of biomaterial and the bioreactor, with application to reconstructive surgery involving other tubular
organs such as the esophagus, trachea or large blood vessels."

Aaron Murnan, PhD, LMFT is a tenure-track assistant professor at University of Cincinnati's College of
Nursing. His career goal is to become an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in co-designing novel
interventions to address salient treatment needs among families disproportionately impacted by opioid use and
justice-involvement, specifically women in the sex trade. The term `co-design' refers to a community-based
participatory research methodology in which individuals with lived experience are engaged as study team
members to lend their hands-on expertise and thoroughly participate in the intervention development process.
Given well-documented risks associated with the sex trade and opioid use, as well as a lack of interventions
prospectively designed to address challenges experienced by this population, the current study represents a
critical next step towards promoting the health and well-being of women in the sex trade. The proposed five-
year Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) will provide Dr. Murnan a perfect
opportunity to achieve his career goals through training in: 1) Community-Based Participatory Research; 2)
ADAPT-ITT substance use intervention adaptation methodologies; and 3) conducting research within the
criminal justice system. Dr. Murnan's proposed study aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of co-
designed family-based intervention offered as an adjunct to treatment diversion programming (offered through
the criminal justice system) using a pilot RCT design. In Aim 1, participant family dyads (n=15 women paired
with one supportive family member) will be recruited to explore intervention needs, motivations, and barriers
related to participating in family-based intervention, as well as delivery preferences. This information will be
used by the co-design team (individuals with lived experience, the PI, and other research personnel) to adapt a
family-based intervention manual. For Aim 2, additional family dyads (n=60) will be recruited to participate in a
randomized controlled trial in which they will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: 1) co-
designed family-based intervention + diversion treatment programming or 2) diversion treatment programming
only. Feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of both interventions will be evaluated (Aim 2). Dr.
Melinda Butsch Kovacic, a leading expert in community-based participatory research, will serve as Dr.
Murnan's primary site mentor. Dr. Butsch Kovacic in conjunction with his co-mentors (Drs. Jennifer Brown and
Sarah Manchak) will provide him with necessary training in areas of community-based participatory research,
substance use intervention adaptation methodologies, and conducting research within the criminal justice
system, that will launch his independent research career as a clinician scientist with the requisite skills to
conduct high quality intervention research to promote best outcomes among families disproportionately

10898078,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
Traditionally, nutrition research has relied heavily on self-reported measures of dietary intake that are often
prone to measurement error. To date, only a few recovery biomarkers of nutrient intake have been established,
including doubly labeled water for estimating energy intake, 24-hour urinary nitrogen for estimating protein
intake, and 24-hour urinary potassium as a biomarker of potassium intake. This highlights the urgent need to
identify further objective and robust biomarkers of food intakes. Recent advances in high-throughput -omics
technologies and the development of novel bioinformatic tools now enable the unbiased discovery of novel
biomarkers that are sensitive and specific to intakes of foods and food groups. The overall objective of the
Dietary Biomarker Development Center (DBDC) at Harvard University is to identify and validate dietary
biomarkers of important protein and carbohydrate food sources in the US diet by using the state-of-the-art
metabolomic techniques and through a combination of well-controlled dietary intervention trials and
observational studies. Our objective is to establish an Administrative Core will play scientific and
administrative leadership roles by integrating the Intervention Core, Data Analysis Core, Metabolomics Core,
and the Biomarkers Project to improve efficiency, enhance innovation, and extend the breadth and depth of the
science within the DBDC at Harvard and across the DBDC’s and the Data Coordinating Center (DCC). The
Core will be led by Dr. Frank Hu, with co-leadership provided by Dr. Clary Clish. Additional key leadership will
be provided by Executive Committee (EC) members, including the Core PIs and Directors and the Project
Director, Dr. Shilpa Bhupathiraju. The DBDC at Harvard Center brings together investigators of diverse
backgrounds and expertise to identify novel biomarkers of several important carbohydrate and protein sources
in the US diet. The expertise in our research team is wide-ranging, covering dietary assessment, population
science, nutritional biochemistry, bioinformatics, and biotechnologies. The stimulating intellectual environment
in the Longwood/Harvard Medical Area is highly conducive for carrying out this research. The Center will take
full advantage of institutional commitment and resources provided by HSPH and other participating institutions,
as well as those provided by the broader Harvard community, such as Harvard Catalyst and the Harvard
Nutrition and Obesity Research Center. The infrastructure for the Administrative Core will provide a strong and
visionary leadership role in science, administration, and dissemination for the DBDC at Harvard University."
10898080,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY – INTERVENTION CORE
Diet is one of the most important determinants of human health and an essential component of population-wide
primary prevention strategies. However, there is controversy about the quality and reliability of population-
based nutrition research. Indeed, the vast majority of evidence for healthy eating is informed by large studies
with dietary patterns assessed via self-report. Self-reported tools have well-recognized limitations.
Plasma biomarkers have been a mainstay of epidemiologic studies. Recent advances in metabolomics
technology has similarly fostered discovery of metabolites that are highly specific to intakes of foods or food
groups. Metabolomics offers a tangible opportunity to identify novel metabolomic signatures for a range of
foods and nutrients. However, this progress relies on the tremendous need for controlled feeding studies to
identify and validate metabolites specific to each food item and group.
Our objective is to establish an Intervention Core, equipped to perform tightly controlled pharmacokinetic and
dose-response feeding studies across a range of food items and food groups in diverse populations. We will
focus on common foods from the protein and grains food groups: (1) chicken, beef, and soybeans; and (2)
whole wheat bread, potatoes, and oats. Based on our collective extensive work in nutrition metabolomics, we
hypothesize that acute administration of these foods will have distinct metabolomics signatures that persist
over an ensuing 24-hour period. Moreover, plasma concentrations of these metabolites will respond to the
amount of the food consumed over a 6-day feeding period. Our long-term goal through these exemplar cases
is to establish a rigorous and highly productive resource to the NIH, USDA, and external investigators to
systematically catalog specific, reliable, and externally validated metabolomic signatures of nearly all
commonly consumed foods in the United States.
This proposal combines the nutrition, epidemiology, metabolomics, and feeding trials expertise of
investigators at the Harvard T.H.Chan School of Public Health, the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, and
Harvard Medical School affiliated hospitals to create a state-of-the-art nutrition-metabolomics center that will
pave the way for a new era in nutrition research. Building on a long-track record of collaboration, this proposal
will contribute novel, objective, metabolomic biomarkers for the characterization of diet in large population-
based studies. Ultimately, this proposal answers the NIDDK and USDA’s call “for objective biomarkers of
dietary intake that can serve as independent markers of dietary intake and complement current dietary intake
assessment methods.”"

types. No single organization can do this work alone. We have a deep commitment to both trial innovation
and collective network capacity within and beyond the CTSA Consortium and have a lengthy history of

tools supporting clinical research coordination, including: global data management, mobile data collection,
recruitment, Electronic Health Record (EHR) research, single IRB coordination, contracting, community
engagement, returning value to participants, eConsent, virtual/remote participation in studies, and EHR
integration with REDCap. We will leverage and expand upon these programs as we are Engaging Cooperative
Sites for Trial Acceleration, Trust, Innovation, and Capability (ECSTATIC). We will establish a distributed
alliance of 6 CTSA-aligned coordinating centers to add elastic capacity and broaden expertise to the TIN’s
CCC/DCC infrastructure. Our alliance has 14 expert trialists that can inform the use of integrated approaches
for more efficient clinical research. Additionally, we will partner with the well-established Biostatistics,
Epidemiology, and Research Design (BERD) group and health equity experts to ensure every study has
access to needed expertise starting from study design through analysis. We will broaden the types of
organizations that can readily participate in clinical research across the U.S., including Historically Black
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), to reach the populations most in need of support. Based on our novel

and matched by expertise to intentionally accommodate all study design types. Led by Gordon Bernard,
MD, Wesley Self, MD, and Christopher Lindsell, PhD, each seasoned in leading and collaborating with
multisite clinical trial networks, ECSTATIC will embrace and draw on diverse expertise to build, test, and share
new resources that will enhance and accelerate rigorous, reproducible research for all CTSAs, to more rapidly
improve human health. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) demonstrate and disseminate novel integrated
approaches for more efficient clinical research including EHR-embedded, remote no-touch, and platform
trials, aligning with study needs; 2) expand and enrich clinical trial capability by increasing potential
participating site Expression of Interest (EOI) reach and readiness support (HBCUs and rural Practice-Based
Research Networks), better process integration with CTSAs, preparing study teams, and broader expert
engagement; 3) innovate clinical trial methodology by creating, evaluating, and disseminating new methods

10842278,"Project Summary & Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a deadly primary brain cancer with a median overall survival (OS) of only 14-16
months. Despite a treatment regimen including surgical resection followed by radio-chemo-therapy, the
majority of patients will recur within 7 months of diagnosis. We identified in a phase 1 trial that pharmacological
ascorbate (PAscH-; IV vitamin C reaching ≈ 20 mM in plasma) combined with standard GBM therapy is well
tolerated with promising outcomes in poor prognosis subjects with MGMT positive/IDH1 wild type tumors. This
led to the recent completion of enrollment of a PAscH- GBM phase 2 trial (NCT02344355) treated with
standard radiation and temozolamide and PAscH-. Median OS in the GBM phase 2 trial was 22 months.
Our research team made the exciting mechanistic observation that PAscH- selectively enhances GBM radio-
chemo-therapy, relative to normal human astrocytes, because of differences in the metabolism of redox active
iron (Fe). This mechanism results from the selective increased Fe-mediated oxidation of ascorbate in tumor
tissue leading to the formation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 can be directly toxic to cancer cells or can
react with Fe through Fenton chemistry to produce hydroxyl radicals that damage DNA, proteins, and lipids
and hence synergizes with radio-chemo-therapy. Furthermore, preliminary analysis of the PAscH- GBM phase
2 trial identified that subjects with increased tumor Fe, detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2*
relaxation, had significantly increased progression free survival (11.2 months vs. 5.7 months). This suggests
T2* relaxation may be a non-invasive biomarker to predict Fe dependent response to PAscH-.
Ferumoxotyol (FMX) is an Fe oxide nanoparticle used in glioma MR imaging. Preliminary pre-clinical data
show that ascorbate and ionizing radiation facilitate the release of Fe from FMX that can be detected by
alterations in MRI parameters (T1 enhancement and decreased T2* relaxation time). The released Fe would
then be available for the therapeutic enhancement of PAscH-. In GBM human tumors, FMX mediated T1
enhancement detects Fe release for up to 72 hours after infusion in the tumor and surrounding edema volume.
Given this exciting preliminary data, FMX may represent the ideal GBM imaging and therapy agent when
combined with PAscH-. We hypothesize iron supplementation with FMX in combination with PAscH- and
standard of care therapy will be safe and increase redox active Fe content (detected by T2* relaxation)
in GBM tumors as part of a phase 1 clinical trial. Each subject’s GBM tumor will be analyzed by T2* MRI for
changes in redox active Fe as well as assessing plasma for evidence of Fe overload and liver injury.
Completion of these studies will assess the impact of the redox active Fe manipulation on GBM therapy. If
successful, future phase 2 studies will investigate the potential of combining PAscH- and FMX with standard
GBM therapy to improve survival and sensitize subjects that might not otherwise respond to PAscH- radio-
chemo-therapy."
10879032,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Life support with extracorporeal circulation through a membrane oxygenator (ECMO) is a
mainstay of advanced critical care. However, clotting in the ECMO circuit and bleeding from the
patient are the major complications, accounting for morbidity and mortality in 30% of patients.
Surface–based coatings are available, but still require systemic anticoagulation because these
surfaces do not prevent platelet adhesion and activation. We have developed a nonthrombogenic
surface which prevents platelet activation at the surface. This could eliminate the need for
systemic anticoagulation and prevent major bleeding and circuit clotting complications. The
surface is based on nitric oxide (NO), which is the mechanism of surface anticoagulation of the
normal endothelium. The chemistry, coating, NO generation, and effectiveness have been tested
in preliminary studies. This research will refine the nitric oxide surface anticoagulation system
(NOSA), and demonstrate effectiveness compared to systemic anticoagulation. The results will
apply to nonthrombogenic surfaces for other extracorporeal devices such as hemodialysis,
hemofiltration, and cardiopulmonary bypass."

BOLD AND NEW BIOENGINEERING RESEARCH”
In contrast with other organs, preservation times of lung grafts for transplantation are limited to
no more than 8 hours with standard cold preservation. Declining quality with extending
preservation times increases the risk of primary graft dysfunction, a risk factor for developing
chronic rejection, which could account for the low 5-year survival rate (50%) following lung
transplantation (LTx). Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP) is expected to improve lung preservation
and transplant outcomes by providing normothermic circulation and ventilation. A problem is that
current EVLP is self-limited by normothermia-activated lung metabolism. The accumulation of
toxic metabolites leads to a proinflammatory state, activating Receptor of Advanced Glycation
End-Products (RAGE) and nuclear factor (NF)-B mechanisms, which in turn upregulate
proinflammatory cytokine signaling. Experimentally, cross-circulation of a whole swine with EVLP
by others demonstrated improved lung resuscitation, but the exact contributors to this
improvement remain unclear. Own in vitro preliminary data suggest a role for hepatic function in
enhancing endothelial preservation. In previous work, we have maintained normal hepatic
detoxification, synthesis, and regulation in in vitro circuits using liver cell bioreactors (BRx). We
hypothesize first that the liver function in the swine cross-circulation model played a major role
in enhancing EVLP and tissue viability. We also hypothesize that a hepatocyte BRx can partly
substitute for whole-swine liver function on EVLP and maintain the observed improvements lung
preservation and LTx outcomes. Our Specific Aim is to provide proof-of-principle for the ability
of hepatocyte BRx to enhance lung graft preservation. We will incorporate a hepatic BRx in our
established EVLP circuits and demonstrate its effect on short-term LTx in experimental rat
models. We will repeat these experiments using a cadaveric human EVLP model. We will conduct
comprehensive phenotypic, transcriptional, and functional endpoint assessments on lung tissue
and hepatic cells in BRx, such as RAGE and NF-B. If successful, our technology will provide the
means to change the current state of EVLP for lung preservation and allow lungs to be maintained
longer outside the donor body with less cellular injury. Ultimately, our work will address current
limitations in LTx, including increasing viable donor organ transportation time and distance,
helping reduce LTx waiting lists, and improving post-transplant patient survival."
10876461,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common genetic disease caused by a defect in the CF transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR). The pathogenesis of CF lung disease is unclear and controversial, at least partially due to
lack of studies in an appropriate CF animal model. In addition, most studies regarding the pathogenesis rely on
data from cultured human diseased large proximal airways, such as tracheal and bronchial tissue. However,
pathological and clinical data suggest that the disease is initiated in small airways with a diameter <2mm.
Iowa group has engineered pigs with deletion or mutation of CFTR. These pigs mimic human CF, including
development of spontaneous infections and obstruction of airways with mucus and inflammatory cells. This
model provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the pathogenesis of CF lung disease. Our
objective for this study is to investigate how loss of CFTR leads to host defense defects in CF small airway
epithelia and if viral vector mediated delivery of CFTR cDNA to CF small airways will rescue host defense
defects. Our overall hypothesis is that AAV4 mediated delivery of CFTR will correct ASL properties and restore
host defense function of small airway epithelium in CF. In Aim 1, we will use AAV4 to deliver CFTR cDNA in
cultured small airway epithelial cells from CF pigs and examine ASL properties including pH and viscosity and
bacterial killing abilities. In Aim 2, we will use human small airway epithelia from CF patients to test the
hypothesis. In Aim 3, we will examine the cellular tropism and efficiency of AAV4 mediated gene delivery to
small airway epithelium in live pigs and human lung explant. The proposed studies will lead to a better
understanding of the CFTR-mediated host defense mechanisms and illustrate a potentially important yet
previously underappreciated role of small airway epithelial cells in pathogenesis of CF lung disease."
10866510,"SUMMARY. Kinase inhibitors targeting the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPKcs)
are being developed to sensitize tumors to clastogenic (chromosomal-breaking) agents, such as radiotherapy.
The DNAPKcs kinase inhibitor M3814 (EMD Serono) is in clinical trials, and other new potent inhibitors have
been reported. Elucidating the role of DNAPKcs in the repair of chromosomal breaks is significant because it will
enable the identification of the contexts (e.g. tumor genetic background and treatment regimens) in which
DNAPKcs kinase inhibitors are most effective, and thereby develop biomarkers to predict tumor response.
DNAPKcs has long been recognized as important for promoting radioresistance, but its role in chromosomal
break repair has remained elusive. Namely, DNAPKcs associates with factors in the canonical non-homologous
end joining (C-NHEJ) pathway for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair but is not required for all C-NHEJ
events (e.g. is largely dispensable for V(D)J recombination signal EJ). Furthermore, until recently, specific
assays to detect C-NHEJ of chromosomal DSBs, apart from V(D)J recombination, have not been available, due
to partial redundancy with the alternative EJ (ALT-EJ) pathway. To address this gap in technology, our laboratory
recently identified a specific hallmark of C-NHEJ. Namely, we reported that several C-NHEJ factors (i.e. XLF,
KU70, and XRCC4) are required for EJ between blunt-ended DSBs (induced by the Cas9 nuclease) that are
joined without causing insertion/deletion mutations (indels), i.e. for accurate/No Indel EJ. In preliminary data, we
show that DNAPKcs is partially required for No Indel EJ, but its role is substantially magnified in cells with XLF
reduced-function mutations (hypomorphs), including mutations in an XLF motif important for binding the KU
heterodimer and DNA. Building on these findings, we will define the role of DNAPKcs in chromosomal EJ and
clastogen resistance. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that XLF and DNAPKcs function synergistically to ensure No
Indel EJ, and this synergy is critical for clastogen resistance. We will also examine the interplay between these
two factors in DNA replication, and define the key domains of XLF and DNAPKcs important for each of these
functions. In Aim 2, we investigate the interplay between DNAPKcs and a set of KU-binding factors, as well as
ALT-EJ, on clastogen resistance and genome stability. We test whether DNAPKcs functions synergistically not
only with XLF, but also with each of four KU-binding factors (CYREN/MRI, PAXX, APLF, and WRN), for No Indel
EJ, clastogen resistance, and robust recruitment of KU to DNA damage. These studies will fill a major gap in our
understanding of C-NHEJ mechanisms. Finally, we posit that combined disruption of DNAPKcs and ALT-EJ
causes aberrant DSB end processing, leading to large deletions, and/or persistent, unrepaired DSBs, thereby
causing reduced clonogenic survival and/or clastogen sensitization. In summary, we will test the overall
hypothesis that DNAPKcs promotes accurate EJ (i.e. No Indel EJ), that its role in such EJ is magnified by defects
in a set of KU-binding factors, and that it is critical for genome stability in cells deficient in ALT-EJ."

Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) are a mainstay of myeloma therapy. They work by binding to the substrate
recognition surface of the cereblon (CRBN) E3 ubiquitin ligase and, in so doing, alter its substrate specificity
such that it now targets the critical myeloma transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3 for proteasomal
degradation. A majority of patients develop resistance to IMiDs, and in some patients, the myeloma cells fail to
make CRBN and become pan-IMiD resistant. Such patients have a very poor prognosis. To address this issue,
I have developed a novel positive-selection screen for the identification of small molecule degraders of any
protein of interest. As a proof-of-concept, I have applied this screen to IKZF1. I have identified Spautin-1, a
novel degrader of IKZF1 that acts via an unknown mechanism that is distinct from that of IMiDs. In Aim 1, I
propose to identify the minimal Spautin-1 responsive degron. In Aim 2, I propose complementary genetic and
biochemical experiments to identify the proteins necessary for the action of Spautin-1. Aims 1 and 2 should
together help elucidate the mechanism of action of Spautin-1. In Aim 3, I propose SAR studies to find Spautin-
1 derivatives with increased potency against IKZF1 and minimal off-target effects, and that destabilize IKZF1 in
vitro and in vivo models. These studies will help identify a novel pathway for destabilizing IKZF1, and may yield
novel treatments for IMiD-refractory myeloma. Finally, if successful, these studies will point the way towards
the eventual application of this strategy to undruggable transcription factors in other neoplasms.
 I'm a medical oncologist with a research background in cancer biology, applying for a K08 award with
the long-term goal of becoming a tenure-track, independent laboratory investigator. I envision developing an
independent research program aimed at understanding the pathways that regulate the activity and stability of
critical oncogenic transcription factors in hematologic malignancies, and harnessing that knowledge to develop
new therapies for patients. During my proposed K08 research training, I will perform mentored research in the
lab of Dr. William Kaelin at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) on the mechanism by which Spautin-1
degrades IKZF1. I will spend 90% of my time on research and 10% on patient care and teaching duties while
seeing patients with hematologic malignancies. I have assembled an expert scientific advisory committee to
help guide my development including: Dr. Kenneth Anderson (Harvard Medical School, DFCI), Dr. Eric Fischer
(DFCI), Dr. Sara Buhrlage (DFCI), and Dr. Wade Harper (HMS). My clinical mentor is Dr. Daniel Deangelo, a
national expert on leukemia. I believe that training in a world-class clinical and research environment, along
with additional coursework and conferences will help me achieve my long-term career goals."

Recent studies have shown data suggesting that the ocular microbiome exists and influences ocular surface
health and disease. Despite this defining the “core” components of the ocular surface microbiome has been
difficult largely due to the low biomass nature of the eye, a lack of robust data sets, reliance only on next
generation sequencing (NGS), and the inability to show causal relationships between microbes and host
physiology. Herein, we have outlined a proposal that directly addresses these knowledge gaps and that will lay
the foundation for future studies aimed at investigating how the ocular surface microbiome influences health and
disease. We have recruited a multidisciplinary research team that consists of experts in clinical and basic
ophthalmology research, microbiome of low biomass sites, and immunology. With this team, we plan to first
characterize the healthy human ocular microbiome in two geographic locations (Pittsburgh and Miami)
longitudinally (0, 1 week, 3 months) using molecular techniques (DNA and RNA sequencing) and culturomics.
While molecular techniques will provide us with the broadest consortia of bacteria, culturomics will provide us
with viable bacteria that we plan to bank in the Campbell Laboratory, so that bacteria from healthy human eyes
can be a resource for the community in future studies. Next, because immunity is normally generated towards
components of the microbiome that remain associated with the host for extended periods of time, we plan to use
human immune responses directed against ocular bacteria to distinguish colonizing bacteria from transient
bacteria that are likely washed away. To further refine the understanding of ocular colonizing bacteria, we plan
to inoculate germ free (GF) and specific pathogen free (SPF) mice with human ocular bacteria. After an extended
period of time, we plan to re-isolate bacteria from the eyes of mice. Bacteria that are still present on the ocular
surface will be considered to have a higher likelihood of being an ocular surface colonizer in humans. The
development of a model such as this will allow others to assess the colonizing ability of other bacteria that may
be considered a core component of the ocular surface microbiome. In sum, data from our proposal will be a
resource for the community at large because we will have: 1) generated a robust set of ocular microbiome
sequencing data that will provide information on the stability and consistency of ocular microbiome signatures,
2) created a bank of bacteria that were acquired from healthy human eyes, 3) defined protocols to use human
immunity to measure the colonizing ability of bacteria, 4) developed an in vivo animal model to assess how
ocular bacteria can be inoculated and re-isolated from the eye. These resources will be free to use for the
community and will act as a base to further investigate how the ocular microbiome influences ocular surface
health and disease."
10896152,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
At a time when youth suicide and school shooting incidents are increasing, a growing number of U.S. schools are implementing commercially available social media surveillance (SMS) technology that can allegedly identify mental health and safety threats by monitoring students' social media posts. Although SMS technology is increasingly being purchased and used by schools, such use is often not disclosed to students or parents. There is also a lack of transparency regarding the methods used by companies to collect information about students, and there are no guidelines to inform how schools use and respond to the information they receive. Moreover, there is typically no evaluation of practice by schools, and there has been no systematic assessment of the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI), including how it affects the students whom it purportedly aims to help. We recently conducted a brief survey of 529 students, parents, teachers, and school administrators on perceptions of SMS. Compared to administrators, students were less supportive of using SMS, more skeptical of whether it could address violence, bullying, and mental health issues, and parents felt it could lead to data misuse and discrimination. These preliminary data point to differing perspectives among stakeholder groups and suggest more work is needed to assess the ways in which SMS is currently implemented and the range and complexity of possible effects on students. The long-term goal of this research is to promote the health, safety, and privacy interests of students and the institutional obligations and interests of schools by identifying and mitigating harms from school-based SMS. The overall objective of this application is to document the ways in which SMS is currently being used by school administrators, assess the perspectives of students and parents, and analyze the ELSI issues. Our hypothesis, based on our preliminary work, is that administrators engage in a wide range of implementation practices and that some youth are vulnerable to adverse effects of school-based SMS. The work proposed in this application is needed to inform student-centered policy recommendations in this area where little transparency and regulation currently exist. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Document school administrators' reasons for using SMS and current implementation practices; 2) Assess the perceived effects of school-based SMS on students and identify student characteristics associated with vulnerability to adverse effects; and 3) Conduct a detailed analysis of the ELSI issues with school-based SMS and develop policy recommendations. This project will generate new insights about perceptions and practices related to SMS in schools. Results could also inform a research agenda in this area, including whether systematic intervention studies of some school-based SMS systems are warranted, and if so, offer study design considerations that center the mental health needs of students and youth. More generally, this work will inform current and future practices and policies related to the use of SMS and other forms of digital surveillance in broader areas of public health."

In response to PAR-19-269 “Cognitive Systems Analysis of Alzheimer's Disease Genetic and Phenotypic Data”,
in this proposal we assemble an interdisciplinary team to develop novel and robust analytical approaches to
effectively address the current challenges in capitalizing on genetics, omics and neuroimaging data in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Our team expertise covers complex disease genetics, functional genomics and
regulation, machine learning/deep learning, systems-oriented research, neuroimaging, drug informatics,
computational neuroscience, and clinical and translational science. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been shown
powerful in uncovering hidden features that are critical to disease diagnosis or etiology. However, merely making
the AI models “explainable” does nothing for explainability of AD, including major effects detailed in molecular
biology, pathology, and neuroimaging. Our overall goal is to develop and implement a robust AI framework,
namely AIM-AI, for transforming the genetic catalog of AD in a way that is Actionable, Integrated and
Multiscale, so that genetic factors have clear utility for subsequent etiological studies. To make our
findings Actionable, we explore multiple-omics systems that functionally intercept the effects of genetic factors
at the cell-type-specific and single-cell resolution. We will develop Integrated and brain-data-driven collective
systems, covering genetic, phenotypic, multi-omics, cell context, neuroimaging and knowledgebase information.
Finally, a Multiscale systems biology approach will be implemented to identify genetic, neuroimaging, and
phenotypic changes, which in combination can better explain the genetic architecture of AD and its cognitive
decline. We will mine the AD characteristics at functional, cellular, tissue- and cell type-specific, and
neuroimaging levels, enabling more rigorous assessment and validation that genetics effects indeed play out in
cognitive decline and AD phenotypes. Our proposal has three specific aims. Aim 1: Develop a deep learning
framework, “DeepBrain-AD”, to characterize the genetic risk of AD using both bulk brain tissue and single-cell
regulatory genomics. Aim 2. Identify variants that account for cognitive decline due to AD progression by
developing deep learning models that connect multiple modalities (imaging, clinical, genomics) in a joint analysis
framework. Aim 3. Assess and validate the genetic variants from Aims 1 and 2 using multiple omics data to
illustrate molecular systems which mediate their effects. In summary, we will uniquely investigate and validate
genetic variants and other markers in AD at multi-omics level, at the cell-type context and single-cell resolution;
and link the genetic association signals with functional regulation, protein expression, and neuroimaging context;
and finally explain their roles in cognitive decline due to AD progression. The successful completion of this project
will generate a robust AIM-AI framework, including machine learning methods/tools, resources, and scientific
discoveries through integrative omics, deep learning, and other systems-based approaches, which will be
immediately shared with AD and other disease research communities."
10814293,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Neurocutaneous Melanocytosis (NCM) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by
benign to aggressively malignant pigmented lesions in the brain and melanocytic nevi on skin present at birth.
Incidence is estimated at 1/50,000 – 1/200,000 births. Symptomatic NCM, reported to be a third to half of all
cases is fatal, death occurring within 2-3 years of diagnosis due to neurological and other abnormalities. Due to
the rarity of human samples and unavailability of experimental models, very little is known about the origin and
development of the disease. Recently, somatic activating mutations in NRAS (NRAS Q61K/R) have been
identified in majority of NCM patients’ tumors (Kinsler et.al., 2013). Mutation acquired early during development
in the embryonic neural crest cells (NCCs) is thought to be the driving factor. However, nothing is known about
the molecular mechanisms underlying NRAS activation in NCCs and oncogenic processes involved in their
neoplastic transformation. Our preliminary data indicate that NRAS Q61K expression in NCCs is not sufficient to
initiate tumorigenesis in a transgenic mouse. Additional evidence suggests that Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF)
signaling during embryogenesis may be an important component in driving leptomeningeal and skin
melanocytosis. This proposal aims to test the hypothesis that mitogenic signaling from overactive HGF plays a
cooperative role in initiating neoplastic transformation of NRAS Q61K/R mutant NCCs during development. Two
different transgenic mice – one conditionally expressing NRAS Q61K in developing NCCs and the other
described by Glenn Merlino’s laboratory as overexpressing HGF during embryogenesis will be used to develop
a transgenic mouse model of NCM. Lesions developed in the offspring resultant from cross breeding these two
transgenic variants will be characterized using histological analyses, fluorescence IVIS imaging and MRI. To
identify the molecular determinants of NCCs transformation RNA-Sequencing approaches along with differential
gene expression analysis, pathway analysis and immunohistochemical methods will be employed. From these
data, this study aims to elucidate the cellular pathways involved in the origin and progression of NCM, induced
cooperatively by oncogenic NRAS and HGF. These experiments fit the mission of the NIH and NCI because
they have direct relevance to furthering our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of a
rare pediatric cancer about which we know very little. Furthermore, they develop a transgenic mouse model as
an experimental platform to investigate cooperative factors in NRAS initiated oncogenesis from NCCs and will
serve as useful in vivo paradigm for understanding molecular underpinnings of NRAS driven tumors of neural
crest derived tissues in future studies."

10817254,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A hallmark of colorectal cancers is the loss of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene,
resulting in dysregulated Wnt signaling and the oncogenic transformation of colon stem cells into cancer stem
cells. In addition, inflammation, a major risk factor for the development of colorectal cancer, can upregulate
cytokines that can drive the formation of tumor-initiating cells. Thus, strategies that target both inflammation and
cancer stem cells may be effective in decreasing the risk of developing colorectal cancer. Sulforaphane, a
naturally-occurring isothiocyanate derived from cruciferous vegetables and particularly abundant in broccoli, has
well-established anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities. However, the precise mechanism by which it inhibits
tumorigenesis and whether it is capable of reducing colorectal cancer risk remain to be determined. We have
previously demonstrated that sulforaphane inhibits NFκB-mediated inflammatory responses in breast cancer
cells as well as the proliferation and self-renewal capacity of breast cancer stem cells. We now have preliminary
data strongly suggesting that sulforaphane has similar effects in colon cancer cells and more importantly, can
inhibit the growth of human organoids driven by an APC mutation. Furthermore, mice fed a preparation of broccoli
that is enriched in sulforaphane are more resistant to the development of colonic inflammation and adenoma
formation. In this proposal, we will examine the efficacy of a pharmaceutical preparation of sulforaphane in
suppressing the establishment of tumor-initiating cells driven by dysregulated Wnt signaling and determine its
ability to inhibit colon stem cells capable of malignant transformation using in vivo mouse models and in vitro
patient-derived organoid cultures. The proposed studies will be critical in developing a synthetic analog of
sulforaphane as a chemopreventive agent in patients at high risk for developing colorectal cancer."
10850718,"Background: Endothelial cell (EC) pathobiology drives pulmonary hypertension (PH), but confusion over the
evolution of EC phenotypes in this disease has persisted for decades. EC senescence, a state of stable cell
cycle arrest, has been reported in PH, but the regulatory features are unknown. Led by our prior work showing
deficiency of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in PH, we found that a Fe-S biogenesis protein, frataxin (FXN), controls
senescence in pulmonary ECs. This may occur in Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA), a disease marked by genetic
FXN deficiency, cardiomyopathy, and often PH. Here, we offer a new model of EC biology in PH, where FXN
loss promotes genotoxic stress and senescence in a pulmonary EC subset with low enough FXN. Senescent
ECs then promote inflammation and drive many PH subtypes, including PH of FRDA and left heart disease.
Hypothesis: We propose FXN deficiency, driven by genetic or acquired means, orchestrates Fe-S-dependent
genotoxic stress, enforcing EC senescence and multiple PH subtypes. Aim 1. Determine if FXN deficiency
drives DNA damage to enforce EC senescence. By study of human pulmonary artery and microvascular ECs
and via genome editing of FXN mutations in inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived ECs from FRDA
patients, we will study the role of FXN in genomic stress and EC senescence. Via study of circulating factors,
histology, and single cell RNA sequencing, we will assess EC senescence in plasma and rare lung specimens
from PAH patients and FRDA and HCM patients with pulmonary vascular disease. We expect to see a dose-
dependent orchestration of FXN activities converging on EC senescence and PH. Aim 2. Determine if EC FXN
deficiency depends upon senescence and myeloid inflammation to drive PH. In mice models of Groups 1
PAH and Group 2 PH due to FRDA, by using EC FXN-/- (KO) technology and adeno-associated virus delivery
of FXN and its binding partner ISCU to pulmonary ECs in vivo, we will assess EC genomic stress, senescence,
inflammation, and PH. EC-specific p16 KO mice and CX3CR1 KO mice will be used to define if EC FXN depends
upon senescence and downstream myeloid inflammation to control PH. Thus, we aim to prove a new causative
model of EC biology in PH – one that deconvolutes the confusion over EC heterogeneity that has plagued this
field for decades. Aim 3. Determine if a novel GSTP1 inhibitor increases FXN and reverses multiple PH
subtypes. We found that a GSTP1 inhibitor increases FXN and ISCU and improves PH. We will define this
drug’s efficacy for ameliorating Groups 1-2 PH models and if FXN and GSTP1 are crucial for its function (via
FXN and GSTP1/2 KO mice). If so, we could define an entirely new Fe-S-specific therapy for PH and FRDA.
Significance: Via unique human and rodent discovery platforms, we will investigate an EC Fe-S cluster-
senescence axis controlling multiple PH subtypes. Our work could explain the evolution of EC biology in PH
and shift molecular paradigms, particularly for FRDA and Group 2 PH. Our work will also develop new therapies
using senolytic drugs to control Fe-S biogenesis, notably applicable to Group 2 PH with no approved treatments."

 The two principal neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of brain neuronal activity are -
aminobutyric acid (GABA), one of the most widely distributed inhibitory neurotransmitters, and L-glutamic acid,
an excitatory neurotransmitter. The concentration of GABA is regulated by two pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-
dependent enzymes, L-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), which catalyzes the conversion of L-glutamate to
GABA, and GABA aminotransferase (GABA-AT), which degrades GABA to succinic semialdehyde and
converts -ketoglutarate to L-glutamic acid. When the concentration of GABA diminishes below a threshold
level, convulsions result; raising GABA levels terminates the seizure. When epilepsy is defined broadly as any
disease characterized by recurring convulsive seizures, then over 1% of the entire world population (including
>3 million Americans) can be classified as having epilepsy. One approach to raise GABA levels is with a
molecule that crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and inhibits/inactivates GABA-AT. This effectively
dampens excessive neural activity without affecting basal neuronal firing. Vigabatrin (Sabril®) is an FDA-
approved drug that inactivates GABA-AT and is used to treat infantile spasms and refractory epilepsies;
however, it has serious side effects. Neuropathic pain, including chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy
(a problem for more than 60% of cancer patients treated with chemotherapy), affects 3-17% of the world
population. Inadequate current treatments of pain are exacerbated by adverse side effects, such as abuse
liability, sedation, and altered mental status, which limit treatment utility. Two features of neuropathic pain that
have been identified are reduced GABA levels and spinal GABAergic inhibitory function. The objective of this
proposal is to design and evaluate new mechanism-based inactivator analogs of our previously successful
GABA-AT inactivators to enhance potency and elucidate inactivation mechanisms using computer modeling
and crystallography (Dr. Dali Liu does our crystal structures) as the driving force for design. New inactivators
are being designed for selective GABA-AT inactivation. This will require the use of comparative computer
modeling with structures of compounds bound to several other aminotransferases. A new approach from our
group will be the design of two classes of analogs for improved BBB penetration: a passive diffusion approach
involving simple prodrugs of our previously successful GABA-AT inactivators; and an active diffusion approach
in which molecules known to bind to three different BBB influx transporters will be incorporated into our GABA-
AT inactivators as prodrugs. Finally, the effectiveness of our new molecules will be tested by my collaborator,
Dr. Andrea Hohmann, for their effect on various neuropathic pains, including chemotherapy-induced peripheral
neuropathy. They also will be sent to the NINDS Preclinical Screening Platform for Pain and to the NINDS
Epilepsy Therapy Screening Program to determine their effectiveness in various in vivo epilepsy models."
10914012,"Project Summary/Abstract
The prevalence of obesity in the US population is a growing health risk. We have observed that in high fat diet-
induced obese (DIO) mice, vitamin A aldehyde adducts (bisretinoids) accumulate at elevated levels. Bisretinoids
constitute the complex mixture of visual cycle adducts that form randomly in photoreceptor outer segments due
to non-enzymatic reactions of retinaldehyde. These fluorophores are deposited in retinal pigment epithelial cells
as components of phagocytosed outer segment membrane and constitute the lipofuscin of retina. It is well known
that bisretinoid formation is modulated by the availability of vitamin A (i.e. visual cycle kinetics). The toxicity of
this family of bisretinoids is attributable, at least in part, to their propensity to photogenerate reactive oxygen
species and photodecompose into dicarbonyl- (glyoxal, GO; methylglyoxal, MG) and aldehyde-bearing
fragments.
The broad objectives of the studies proposed in this application are to explore links between the formation of
toxic bisretinoids and dysregulation of vitamin A in association with obesity. Experiments proposed in Specific
Aim 1 will undertake the novel exploration of relationships amongst a high fat diet, vitamin A, retinol binding
protein 4 (Rbp4) and augmented bisretinoid in retina. Our working model is that increased delivery of vitamin A
(retinol) to RPE under these conditions involves both Rbp4 and non-Rbp4 mechanisms. In mice fed a high fat
diet and in obese ob/ob mice we will measure ocular levels of retinoid and bisretinoid and we will employ
quantitative fundus autofluorescence imaging (qAF) for non-invasive measurement of bisretinoid. The role of
RBP4 will be tested in mice by measuring serum Rbp4 and by studying mice deficient in Rbp4-/- due to gene
deletion and drug treatment. Photoreceptor cell health will be evaluated by histometric analysis of outer nuclear
layer. In the studies described in Specific Aim 2, we will address human subjects having excess weight by
measuring bisretinoids using non-invasive quantitative fundus autofluorescence (qAF). In experiments presented
in Specific Aim 3 we will challenge existing notions as to the conditions that govern the the extent of bisretinoid
formation, the loss of bisretinoid due to photooxidation and factors determining the topographic distribution of
SW-AF. To this end, we will quantify the relationship between vitamin A intake and bisretinoid formation. We will
measure loss of bisretinoid by comparing levels in mice reared in darkness versus cyclic light. Bisretinoid
lipofuscin will be measured chromatographically and by non-invasive qAF. The work will employ fundus imaging
and biochemical, histological and cellular assays. Completion of this research will advance our understanding of
previously unrecognized links amongst obesity, vitamin A metabolism and bisretinoid fluorophores."

The University of Chicago (UC) proposes to continue the UC Specialized Training Program in the
Demography and Economics of Aging program, that began in 1994, and requests funded trainee
positions for 4 predoctoral fellows and 3 postdoctoral fellows per year. Housed in the interdisciplinary
Center for Health and the Social Sciences (CHeSS), the NIA T32 Program draws upon the substantial
and complementary resources, faculty, and expertise from across social science disciplines and related
professional schools on UC’s campus, including the Social Science Division’s Departments of
Economics, Sociology, and Comparative Human Development; the Biological Division’s Departments of
Medicine and Public Health Sciences; the Harris School of Public Policy; the School of Social Service
Administration; and the affiliated National Opinion Research Center (NORC). Our program’s record of
trainee productivity and placement is excellent, as is the pool of trainees from which we select, and we
endeavor to recruit and retain trainees who are from populations underrepresented in the sciences. As
in past cycles, the program will continue to offer trainees a highly diverse group of peers and mentors;
an interdisciplinary Demography Workshop (DW) which brings both internal and external speakers to
present aging-related demography research; a program-specific Postmortem Seminar, following the
DW, that allows trainees in the program to discuss the presentation with their peers and faculty leaders;
formal coursework opportunities in aging; and training in the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR).
This newest iteration will also enhance existing training opportunities through the expansion of the
potential mentor pool, provide formal training in Methods to Enhance Reproducibility in Research and
facilitate social survey methods training, increase the number of postdoctoral fellowship positions from
2 to 3 per year, and leverage the newly funded NIA P30 Center for Healthy Aging Behaviors and
Longitudinal InvestigationS (CHABLIS) to increase training in longitudinal studies that examine how
demographic and economic factors facilitate or suppress individual healthy aging behaviors across the
life course. In addition, Kathleen Cagney, PhD, Professor of Sociology, who has served on the NIA T32
Committee on Demographic Training (CDT) Executive Committee (EC) for 12 years, will assume
responsibilities as Program Director (PD) and Colm O’Muircheartaigh, PhD, Professor of Public Policy,
will join the program leadership as Co-Director. Linda Waite, PhD, the George Hebert Mead

10848335,"Despite some progress in understanding the role of the sex hormone estrogen in female susceptibility to
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), the female prevalence in PAH incidence remains largely unexplained.
Investigations into the genetics of PAH in men and women are hampered by the failure to include the sex
chromosomes in genome-wide association studies, to account for sex as variable in targeted genetic analyses,
and even the focus on a single gene as cause of PAH. Moreover, an animal model that recapitulates the sex
differences of PAH is missing. Our supportive data demonstrate that: a) our EHITSN-transduced intersectin-1s
(ITSN) heterozygous mouse (EHITSN-K0ITSN+/-) model of PAH recapitulates most of the sex-specific differences
of human disease; b) pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) are sex dimorphic in the proliferative potential;
c) the expression and activity of the long non-coding RNA Xist is upregulated compared to baseline state in both,
EHITSN-K0ITSN+/- and human PAH female lung specimens. The EHITSN is the N-terminal fragment of ITSN [a
prominent protein of the lung], result of granzyme B cleavage under inflammatory conditions associated with
PAH; EHITSN has endothelial cell proliferative potential and triggers a severe vascular arteriopathy in the lungs
of EHITSN-K0ITSN+/- mice. Upregulation of Xist, essential for dosage compensation of chromosome X (ChrX)-
linked genes expression leads to sex-specific upregulation of Elk1 transcription factor, a ChrX-linked PAH gene,
and of cyclin A1, a cell cycle regulatory protein. The augmented Xist expression negatively regulates Klf2, a key
transcription factor for endothelial homeostasis and quiescence. These molecular events are more prominent in
female EHITSN-K0ITSN+/- mouse and human PAH lung specimens compared to males. Moreover, in vitro
knockdown of Xist via siRNA or its inhibition via a specific EHITSN inhibitory peptide abolish the pathological
manifestations. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that the increase in Xist expression in the female
PAH specimens accounts at least in part, for the sex/ ratio imbalance in PAH. Two Specific Aims will address
this hypothesis: SA #1 will demonstrate that Xist is a key regulator of the sexual dimorphism of PAECs in the
proliferative response. Employing PAECs and lung tissue of PAH, male and female subjects, we will: 1a. Validate
the increased Xist expression and transcriptional activity in female PAH specimens; 1b. Demonstrate that sex-
specific upregulation of the Elk1/ cyclin A1 axis promotes progression of cell cycle and an increased proliferative
response of female PAECs. 1c. Demonstrate that Xist upregulation and its sex-specific interactions with
downstream partners (i.e., Klf2) contribute to the increased proliferative response of female PAECs. In SA #2
we propose to: 2a. Investigate the interactions of the EHITSN with nuclear factors; 2b. Explore the therapeutic
potential of targeting Xist to inhibit female PAECs proliferation and ameliorate vascular remodeling in PAH.
 If successful, the studies will demonstrate that Xist upregulation accounts for female PAECs sexual
dimorphism in the proliferative response and provide a better understanding of the origin of sex bias in PAH."

 Young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) have a high incidence of HIV, particularly in the
South. Thus, interventions tailored to YBMSM to enhance engagement in prevention services are urgently
needed. Engagement in PrEP care among YBMSM is less then optimal. The modified social ecological model
(MSEM) defines the multi-level domains of HIV infection risk among key populations. Barriers to PrEP use
among YBMSM occur at each level: 1) individual, 2) social and sexual network, 3) community, 4) policy, and 5)
stage of the HIV epidemic. Examples include individual (e.g. perception of HIV risk), social and sexual network
(e.g. stigma), community (e.g. lack of medical services), and public policy (e.g. cost of care). The boundary
between each level is permeable, thus each is considered in the proposed study. Utilizing components of
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), we will design an intervention to improve PrEP uptake,
persistence, and adherence. We will use a generalized framework for the adaptation of EBIs to inform the
development of a brief intervention for PrEP tailored to YBMSM, named ACTPrEP. ACT addresses barriers by
promoting: 1) present moment awareness, 2) acceptance of internal and external experiences, and 3)
engagement in behaviors that are consistent with values. To maximize utility, ACTPrEP will be delivered by a
PrEP navigator. Candidate: Dr. Arnold is a medical clinical psychologist/scientist with a research background
in HIV related studies in the South. Her career has focused on HIV intervention and prevention. Building on
prior research, she is applying for a five-year K23 Career Development Award. Mentoring: An exceptional
team of senior investigators serve as mentors. Dr. Brown is the Primary Mentor and has expertise in the
designing and implementing of PrEP Interventions. Four co-mentors bring complementary expertise in PrEP
delivery for YBMSM in the South and adherence monitoring (Dr. Mena); adapting behavior change
interventions (Dr. Gaudiano); implementation science (Dr. Elwy); and quantitative data analyses (Dr. Jones).
Research: The proposed aims are 1) Gather data from YBMSM (n = 20) and clinic staff (n = 10) through in-
depth interviews to assess measures, intervention design, and barriers; 2) Develop ACTPrEP utilizing Aim 1
data and working iteratively with experts; and 3) Evaluate ACTPrEP feasibility and acceptability through a
randomized control trial (n=66) and compare ACTPrEP vs. enhanced standard of care on uptake, adherence,
and PrEP persistence. Trainings: Dr. Arnold will receive specific training in designing, adapting, and testing
theory-based interventions, addressing health disparities with racial and sexual minorities, implementation
science, and quantitative analyses through coursework, seminars, workshops, directed readings, and
mentored research. These training and research experiences will establish the candidate’s career as an expert
in clinically informed behavior change interventions. The candidate is supported by Rhode Island Hospital."

10807099,"A Cereblon Signaling Network in Wnt-driven Cancers
Abstract
The long-term objective of this study is to investigate how Cereblon (CRBN) regulates the Wnt signal transduction
pathway and to demonstrate how this can be exploited to target Wnt-driven colorectal cancers (CRCs). Wnt
signaling is essential for intestinal stem cell maintenance and aberrant activation of this pathway drives the
initiation and progression of nearly all CRCs. To date, no drugs that inhibit the Wnt pathway have been FDA-
approved, partly due to the lack of druggable targets that can bypass common Wnt pathway mutations in CRC.
In a conceptual breakthrough, our recently published findings reveal that Cereblon (CRBN), the substrate
receptor of the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase that is a drug target in hematological malignancies, plays a critical
role in Wnt signal transduction. We found that CRBN promotes the degradation of a subset of substrates,
including Casein kinase 1α (CK1α), a negative regulator of Wnt signaling and a key component of the β-Catenin
destruction complex. Moreover, Wnt stimulation induces the interaction of CRBN with CK1α to promote its
ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, we showed that the role of CRBN in Wnt signaling is conserved in
human cells, mouse intestinal organoids, zebrafish, and Drosophila. These studies demonstrate the first
endogenous mechanism of CRBN regulation and provide a novel means of controlling Wnt pathway activity, with
relevance for animal development and disease. The goal of this project is to use in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo
approaches to gain a better understanding of how the clinically relevant anti-cancer target, CRBN, promotes Wnt
signal transduction. The three specific aims are to: 1) Identify the mechanisms by which Wnt stimulation activates
CRBN; 2) Identify Wnt-stimulated CRBN interactors that regulate tumorigenesis; and 3) elucidate the role of
CRBN in Wnt-dependent cancer progression. Because CRBN is a well-studied target for the development of
drugs to treat hematological malignancies, the knowledge gained from this study will aid in the development of
more selective small molecules as well as suggest innovative treatment strategies for CRC and other Wnt-driven
cancers."

There is an enormous need to create a foundational dataset that will comprehensively catalog somatic
mutations across a diverse range of human tissues, to understand their type, frequency, the cells, and
anatomical compartments in which they are found, and their organizational, functional relationships and
consequences. Somatic variants can occur widely throughout the genome and across the lifespan producing
stochastic, clonal, and dynamic somatic mosaicism. A growing number of studies interrogating mutations in
normal tissues have demonstrated causal roles for somatic variants in age-related processes and both
oncologic and non-oncologic conditions, but these studies have generally been limited to few tissues or few
individuals. The broader functional consequences of somatic variation remain largely unknown. Additionally,
variants in non-coding, regulatory regions of the genome may affect gene expression in different cells or tissues
within individuals, but their patterns also reflect a lifetime of exposures to certain mutational signatures, with
likely differences between tissues and individuals.
Recent advances in genomics provide an opportunity to build a somatic mutation catalog for human tissues and
organs. A cross-tissue catalog of human somatic mutations at high cellular and genetic resolution will provide
an extraordinary opportunity to discover the processes underlying normal tissue function, and leading to
disease, but the development of such a catalog requires state-of-the-art, and novel, experimental and
computational frameworks. As a Genome Characterization Center (GCC) for the Somatic Mosaicism across
Human Tissues (SMaHT) program, our project will contribute to the characterization, and creation of a resource
catalog of somatic variation across human tissues at scale. We will (1) work with the Tissue Procurement
Centers and the network to share tissue sampling protocols; (2) collaborate with other GCCs to undertake
benchmarking of samples across centers to compare production data and pipelines; (3) generate core assays
(short and long-read DNA sequencing and RNA sequencing) across 750 samples, and an additional duplex
sequencing assay across ~250 samples; (4) QC and analyze all data and submit to the Data Analysis Center;
and (5) collaborate across the network broadly on benchmarking comparisons, the development of common
analytical pipelines and QC metrics, and to perform joint data analysis. Our GCC brings together a team with
expertise in human genetics/genomics, production science, computational biology, novel technologies, and the
characterization and interpretation of somatic mutations. We will help create a somatic data resource for the
scientific community that will catalyze studies to understand cellular and tissue changes during human
development, aging, and disease variant interpretation."
10832703,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Humans have highly advanced cognitive abilities and motor skills, characteristics which are reflected in the
enlarged size and cell diversity of our central nervous system (CNS). My overall goal is to profile and compare
progenitor cell diversity in humans, non-human primates and rodents, and thereby identify the origins of
increased cell diversity and size of the human CNS. As part of my postdoctoral research, I collected and analyzed
high-temporal-resolution single-cell RNA-seq data of the well characterized human and mouse spinal motor
neuron (MN) lineage, which led to the identification of a molecularly distinct, human-specific (i.e., not found in
mouse) motor neuron progenitor (hsPMN) cell type. I found that hsPMNs undergo delayed and protracted
neurogenesis, increasing total MN output by ~2-fold. The proposed study aims to characterize how they
contribute to the population size and subtype diversity of the MN lineage by combining single-cell RNA-seq with
long-term astrocyte co-culture or xeno-transplantation of lineage-labeled human cells. Second, the proposed
study will further investigate the evolution of hsPMN cells and their gene expression program by a) determining
whether an orthologous cell type is found in old-world monkeys (i.e., macaque), and b) identifying and functionally
testing newly evolved gene regulatory elements that give rise to hsPMN-specific gene expression patterns.
Finally, I will develop a 3D spinal organoid in vitro differentiation system that harbors spatially patterned ventral
and dorsal spinal lineages, using a standard set of differentiation conditions that can be applied to human,
macaque, and mouse cells. This last aim will broaden the scope of comparative investigations to encompass
multiple spinal lineages, thus opening up new avenues and hypotheses for future research, as well as providing
a more comprehensive in vitro model system of spinal cord development. The insights, protocols, and data
generated from this study will enable and provide valuable comparative analyses into human neural progenitor
diversity and how human-specific progenitors contribute to the size and cell diversity of the CNS during
development. Furthermore, these studies and data will form the foundation of my research agenda as an
independent investigator, while allow me to broaden my research training to include a diverse host of species,
model systems and a wide array of experimental as well as computational techniques."
10911028,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in unparalleled structural damage ranging from molecular to organ levels; and
followed by widespread dysfunctions including maladaptive activation and/or dysregulation of endogenous injury-
response mechanisms. Our long-term goal is to characterize the molecular mechanisms that modulate
progressive brain neurodegeneration and associated neurological impairments after TBI. Veterans are a distinct
group of brain trauma patients because military TBI features specific conditions, before and after trauma that
impact the developing neuropathology. Recent studies have shown that stress results in significant and wide-
ranging negative effects on the brain that may be mediated by pro-inflammatory systemic and central (brain)
mechanisms. These processes that may underpin the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
become even more significant in association with TBI. We hypothesize that exposure to pre- and/or post-TBI
stress changes the trajectory of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration progression in TBI; accelerating and
extending the neuropathological processes and ultimately leading to a self-sustaining and complex TBI-PTSD
condition. The maladaptive transformation of microglia from a neurorestorative phenotype to a dysfunctional
neurotoxic activation after brain trauma, contributes to progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.
A critical unsolved question is what mechanisms transform microglia after TBI and what are the effects of stress
on these mechanisms? microRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at post-
transcriptional level. As microRNAs can target multiple genes, they can concurrently modulate entire pathways
or sets of related pathways that play a role in neuroinflammation and delayed neuronal cell death. Therefore,
microRNAs are evolutionary designed to concurrently regulate multiple molecular pathways; and thus, are an
ideal therapeutic target for effective manipulation of cellular responses.
Our preliminary data implicate changes in [specific] microRNAs pathways [including miR-223 and miR-155] in
the phenotypic imbalance favoring a pro- inflammatory and neurotoxic microglial activation state over the
inflammation-resolving microglial phenotype that promotes restoration and repair following TBI. We hypothesize
that dual Stress-TBI exposure induces microglia transformation toward a distinct pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic
phenotype, causing progressive neurodegeneration and long-term neurological dysfunctions; these processes
include a specific program of microRNAs changes in microglia and neurons. We will test these novel
hypotheses by addressing the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Stress-exposure promotes a shift in microglia toward a pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic phenotype
[associated with miR-223 and miR-155 upregulation] and enhances neurodegeneration after TBI.
Aim 2: [Inhibition of neuroinflammation-promoting miR-223 and miR-155] following pre-TBI stress exposure will
attenuate trauma-dependent neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration and improve neurological function.
Aim 3: [Inhibition of neuroinflammation-promoting miR-223 and miR-155] after TBI+stress will promote the
neurorestorative microglial phenotype and attenuate chronic neuroinflammation, as well as reduce
neurodegeneration and lead to sustained improvements of neurological function."
10879167,"Project Summary Abstract
 While glaucoma is presently treated by lowering intraocular pressure (IOP), additional prevention of visual
impairment may come from altering the detrimental tissue responses to IOP. Initial reports from our team, now confirmed
by others, show that treatments affecting the cellular and connective tissues of the optic nerve head (ONH) are
neuroprotective. The earliest effects on retinal ganglion cell axons at the ONH in glaucoma are mediated by astrocytes and
microglia that respond to IOP-generated mechanical stress. Using mouse models and human glaucoma eyes, we have
identified key junctional complexes at the interface between astrocytes and sclera at the ONH that are altered by IOP
increase. Astrocytes at this location—the unmyelinated optic nerve (UON)—are relatively unique in structure to withstand
scleral hoop stress and the translaminar pressure gradient. We are engaged in detailed study of the components of these
junctional complexes and how they sense and translate stress into both beneficial and detrimental responses in glaucoma.
The elements of this junctional pathway are known to involve Rho-kinase (ROCK) and its study and manipulation are key
elements in the proposal. Astrocyte responses are now classified as protective or toxic in brain disease, and initial studies
suggest these occur in glaucoma, in part mediated by interaction with microglia. A specific inhibitor of microglial
activation of toxic astrocyte development (NLY01) will be studied for its mechanism of action and potential as therapy.
We have developed and will utilize quantitative, rigorous assays for the effects on astrocytes of alteration in their structure
and function, including ROCK inhibitors and the effects of transforming growth factor β pathway alterations. To facilitate
the development of translational agents in later full glaucoma models, we developed a quantitative assay for axonal
transport obstruction after 3 day IOP elevation. In a second major aim, astrocyte gene expression changes in the key UON
region with experimental glaucoma will be fully studied in primary astrocytes, whole eye explants, and living mouse eyes.
Both whole regional tissue digests and single cell RNAseq methodology is being employed to identify both how and in
which cells the changes occur. The protein expression changes attendant to these alterations will be related to
mechanosensation and mechanotranslation of astrocyte behavior and compared to quantitative structural changes at the
microscopic level. Specific activators and inhibitors of the identified pathways will be used to point to potential treatment
approaches. Several transgenic mouse models will be employed: 1) a strain with deficient laminin which is a key
component of the connection of astrocytes to sclera; 2) an angiopoetin1 knockout that produces a new glaucoma model of
higher IOP; and 3) a strain we have exploited to observe strain changes in the ONH in explants that has uniformly
fluorescent astrocytes. In the latter, we present specific alterations in astrocyte—sclera interaction that would provide
protection from or intensification of IOP-produced stress. To rule out that potential beneficial treatments are uniquely
useful only in one mouse model, we will use bead-injection and the angiopoetin mouse models, and laser-induced
glaucoma in the rat, each of which we have shown are amenable to therapeutic measures of ganglion cell soma and axon
preservation that are confirmed by both structural integrity and functional preservation."
10831510,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Portopulmonary Hypertension (PoPH) is a type of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that occurs
exclusively in patients with underlying liver disease. PoPH exhibits the highest morbidity and mortality of all
PAH subtypes, affecting 10% of all chronic liver disease patients, but the mechanisms that drive disease
pathogenesis are poorly understood. Liver portal hypertension and hepatocellular dysfunction are believed to
contribute to vascular remodeling in PoPH through dysregulation of important pathways such as vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. The current diagnostic and prognostic biomarker used in clinical
practice (circulating brain natriuretic peptide, BNP) is a nonspecific marker of elevated pressure and weakly
correlated with disease severity (mean pulmonary arterial pressure, mPAP, and pulmonary vascular
resistance, PVR) in PoPH. Consequently, there is a critical need to develop new PoPH-specific biomarkers
with diagnostic and prognostic value. Next generation sequencing can isolate and study relevant stellate and
endothelial cell populations in PoPH, that are likely to affect important signaling pathways (such as VEGF) and
contribute to the pathogenesis of PoPH.
 The purpose of this NIH K23 proposal is to use a multidisciplinary approach combining integrated next
generation sequencing analysis of liver tissue with biorepository validation to develop novel PoPH-specific
circulating peptide biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic value. We will accomplish this goal by applying
single nuclear RNA sequencing to liver tissue and serum samples from PoPH and non-PoPH cirrhotic patients,
focusing on biologically plausible pathways such as VEGF signaling, to identify novel disease-specific
biomarkers. We will validate these biomarkers using biological samples and clinical data obtained from existing
large well-phenotyped disease biorepositories such as the PAH National Biological Sample and Data
Repository. Our preliminary data has identified circulating VEGF1 receptor protein (FLT1) and Protein Kinase
C Alpha subunit (PRKCA) as a promising PoPH-specific candidate biomarkers with diagnostic value. Using
BNP as a comparator, we will complete the following aims: Aim 1– Determine the differential gene expression
of PoPH endothelial and stellate cells; Aim 2 – Develop FLT1 and PRKCA as biomarkers able to discriminate
PoPH from liver cirrhosis and assess PoPH disease severity; Aim 3 – Develop FLT1 and PRKCA as predictive
biomarkers of treatment response in PoPH. This project is highly relevant to public health because of the
increasing incidence and prevalence, and clinical significance of PoPH and chronic liver disease. Successful
completion of these aims will develop novel PoPH-specific biomarkers with clinical value, train the candidate to
further develop these biomarkers as risk-stratification tools and therapeutic targets in PoPH, and ultimately
improve the clinical care of patients with pulmonary vascular disease due to liver disease."
10872255,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Investigation of cytoplasmic-to-nuclear (C→N) NF-κB signaling pathways induced by various cell surface
receptors has significantly expanded the knowledge regarding the role of this transcription factor family in
regulating immune/inflammatory responses and tumorigenesis. By contrast, the physiological role of DNA
damage-induced nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N→C) NF-κB signaling remains poorly understood. The proposed
study will fill this knowledge gap by elucidating a surprising and crucial role of N→C NF-κB signaling in sustaining
anti-tumor CD8 T cell responses during radiotherapy (RT) in vivo. The current proposal utilizes a genetically
modified mouse model that selectively disables N→C NF-κB signaling in vivo. Our preliminary data show that
radiation therapy can induce sustained regression of syngeneic tumors in a manner dependent on CD8 T cells.
We also found that a special type of memory CD8 T cells implicated in tumor control is expanded in this mouse
model. Finally, we have generated an encouraging data with an NF-kB DNA binding inhibitor to induce sustained
tumor regression following radiation therapy. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that inhibition of
N→C NF-κB signaling in the host improve radiation therapy via generation of tumor antigen-specific memory
CD8 T cells. We will test this hypothesis by define the cellular mechanism of sustained tumor control mediated
by inhibiting host N→C NF-κB signaling in radiation therapy (Aim 1), elucidate the molecular mechanism of
sustained tumor control mediated by inhibiting host N→C NF-κB signaling in radiation therapy (Aim 2) and target
host N→C NF-κB signaling with a chemical inhibitor to improve radiation therapy (Aim 3). The proposed study is
significant because the physiological role of N→C NF-κB signaling in modulating host tumor response is
completely undefined and this study will fill this knowledge gap. It is innovative because a new mouse model and
a novel chemical inhibitor currently undergoing Phase 2 clinical trials will be employed. Finally, a high impact is
expected because chemical targeting of N→C NF-κB signaling by the above inhibitor may expedite timely
translation to clinical trials."

PTH(1-34)], but we have little insight as to how to use them most effectively. TPTD has great appeal for
treating osteoporosis in men because it substantially improves bone mass, rebuilds the microarchitecture,
improves bone strength, and reduces fractures. Little is known about the best ways to employ TPTD in the
treatment of male osteoporosis. Should it be used only as monotherapy or does concurrent or sequential use
with other agents lead to the greatest benefit? The proposed clinical trial is an effort to test a novel
combination therapy for osteoporosis in men based on exciting preclinical findings in mice. It is known that
TPTD achieves its anabolic effects by stimulating PTH receptors (PTH-Rs) in cells of the osteoblast (OB)
lineage. Calcimimetics mimic the effects of high extracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca]e) by activating Ca-
sensing receptors (CaSRs) expressed in many cell types including OBs and osteoclasts in bone. Work by us
and other groups have found that CaSRs in OBs play an important role in controlling bone formation, OB
differentiation, and mineralization. In preclinical models in the lab, we found that daily injections of TPTD
given concurrently with an investigational calcimimetic agent (NPS-R568) in just 6 weeks markedly increased
bone mass and improved both trabecular and cortical microarchitecture of bone as assessed by both micro-
computed tomography and histomorphometry in adult male mice. Based on these results, we propose to test
the hypothesis that concurrent activation of PTH-Rs and CaSRs (TPTD+calcimimetic cinacalcet) in men with
low bone mineral density (BMD) produces greater anabolic responses than PTH-R activation alone
(TPTD+placebo). To test this hypothesis, we propose a randomized, double-blinded, {{placebo-controlled
clinical trial in 48 men with low bone mass}}. We plan two treatment arms. Aim 1 will determine the effects
of 11 months treatment with TPTD+cinacalcet compared to TPTD+placebo on BMD and bone metabolism in
men with low bone mass. We will assess responses in: (a) lumbar spine (LS) BMD (primary endpoint) and
femoral neck (FN) BMD; and (b) levels of the bone formation marker serum N-terminal pro-peptide of type 1
collagen (P1NP). Hypothesis 1a proposes that LS and FN BMD responses are greater with TPTD+cinacalcet
compared to TPTD+placebo. Hypothesis 1b proposes that serum P1NP increases are greater with
TPTD+cinacalcet compared to TPTD+placebo. Aim 2 will determine the pharmacodynamic responses to
TPTD+cinacalcet and to TPTD+placebo treatment in men with low bone mass. We will assess: (a) acute and
chronic changes in the serum [Ca] and plasma intact PTH after drug administration in a pharmacodynamic
study in a subset of 24 men (12/treatment arm); and (b) changes in urinary Ca excretion with both treatment
regimens {in all 48 randomized men}. Hypothesis 2a proposes that serum [Ca] does not decrease to > 5%
below the lower limits of the normal range in response to the administration of combined TPTD+cinacalcet.
Hypothesis 2b proposes that urinary Ca excretion does not exceed 350 mg per 24 hours in men treated
chronically with TPTD+cinacalcet. Completion of this study will provide critical evidence to support the
efficacy of a novel combination therapy that is designed to target the concurrent activation of CaSRs and
PTH-Rs in bone to achieve greater skeletal anabolic effects with the ultimate goal of improving skeletal health
and reducing the disability, morbidity, and mortality of osteoporotic fractures in male veterans."

Skeletal muscle dysfunction contributes to frailty, disability, and mortality in patients with chronic
kidney disease (CKD). This proposal seeks to determine if muscle dysfunction in CKD can be
alleviated by dialysis (blood filtration for kidney failure). We recently discovered that patients
with CKD experience progressively worsening muscle fibrosis, and that greater severity of
fibrosis is associated with reduced muscle strength and physical function. In patients with
severe CKD, fibrotic changes are extensive. However, despite the seemingly advanced nature
of this fibrotic transformation, patients starting dialysis experienced marked improvement in
fibrosis. This suggests that, in patients with severe CKD and muscle fibrosis, the initiation of
dialysis could improve physical function. Therefore, this proposal tests the highly innovative
hypothesis that the initiation of dialysis in patients with severe CKD reverses muscle fibrosis and
improves physical function. We will accomplish this objective using a translational approach that
integrates clinically relevant functional endpoints with state-of-the-art methods including muscle
tissue mechanics, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMR), and transcriptomic and
proteomic studies of human skeletal muscle. The proposed human studies will (1) define the
effect of dialysis initiation on muscle fibrosis by examining changes in muscle collagen content,
collagen cross-linking, tissue passive stiffness, and qMR measures; (2) determine the extent to
which regression of fibrosis after dialysis initiation translates into functional improvements by
testing the association of alterations in the structural parameters from Aim 1 with changes in
muscle strength, endurance, and lower extremity performance; and (3) identify molecular and
cellular predictors of the resolution of fibrosis using transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of
skeletal muscle. If our hypotheses are correct: (1) muscle fibrosis could be an indicator for
physicians to start dialysis therapy; and (2) this proposal will identify an intervention to alleviate
muscle dysfunction in patients with CKD."

Supply and demand constraints have affected PrEP scale-up for cisgender women in the Southern US. PrEP
use requires ensuring that cisgender women who can benefit from PrEP are aware of it (i.e., demand side) and
ensuring PrEP is accessible in settings where cisgender women seek care (i.e., supply side). Anchoring PrEP
care to Title X-funded family planning services that cisgender women already trust, access routinely, and deem
useful for their sexual health is of great appeal, as it offers an ideal opportunity to reach women who may
benefit from PrEP. In Georgia, the state with the highest rate of new HIV diagnoses, our work demonstrates
that many Title X family planning clinics do not provide PrEP. Our research also shows low PrEP awareness
and use among Atlanta cisgender women. Further, our Atlanta-based family planning-focused PrEP
implementation research indicates that even when FP clinics offer PrEP, few cisgender women uptake PrEP,
and providers note continued discomfort with screening, recommending and counseling about PrEP. Lessons
learned from HPV vaccine and contraception rollout demonstrates that awareness and availability alone may
not be sufficient; moving cisgender women from PrEP awareness to uptake demands alternative delivery
models, inclusive of women's perspectives, to overcome other factors impeding women from using PrEP.
Improving PrEP reach among cisgender women may therefore require more effectively engaging them in the
development of appropriated and acceptable patient-centered PrEP care approaches to support uptake. In the
proposed project, we will (Aim 1) use the Interactive Systems Framework to employ tailored implementation
strategies informed by our extensive prior work to support PrEP adoption and implementation across Atlanta
Title X clinics (addressing supply-side barriers); (Aim 2) use an evidence-based Community Organizing
Approach to raise awareness, interest, and connection to PrEP among cisgender women (addressing demand-
side barriers); and (Aim 3) innovatively use human centered design (HCD), a patient-centered methodology
that brings bringing end-users and developers together to co-create care delivery strategies, to bring Southern
women's voices into the development of PrEP care delivery strategies. Given limited research pertaining to
strategies to increase PrEP reach among cisgender women in the South, findings from each aim will
independently fill numerous gaps for optimizing clinic and community strategies to strengthen HIV prevention
for Southern women. Given our collaboration with Georgia Family Planning System (Georgia's Title X grantee),
Atlanta area Title X clinics, and robust partnerships with sexual health CBOs (led by SisterLove), we are
uniquely positioned to mount a coordinated approach across diverse Atlanta counties built around our clinic-
academic-CBO collaboration to strengthen HIV prevention for women, and importantly, to create a sustainable
systems approach to move new HIV prevention (and sexual health) innovations more quickly to women."

This program is a response to the growing burden of trauma and injuries (inclusive of intentional and
unintentional trauma and injuries; henceforth ‘T&I’), the acute and chronic consequences of T&Is and their risk
factors (alcohol, speed, urbanization) and their social and economic consequences which are all neglected
public health issues in Zambia. Two critical gaps in addressing T&Is in Zambia are a lack of trained human
resources and limited data on health, social and economic impacts. The overall goal of the United States-
Zambia Trauma and Injury Research Training Program (US-Zambia TIRP) is to strengthen research
capacity on the health, social and economic impact of trauma and injuries across the lifespan in Zambia
through an innovative model of sustainable capacity development. Our approach will be based on close
collaboration between two institutions–the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public
Health (GWSPH), USA and University of Zambia School of Public Health (UNZA-SPH), Zambia – each with a
great commitment to understanding the impact of T&Is, experience and expertise in research, and a history of
collaborative work. The specific aims of US-Zambia TIRP are: aim 1: to develop a core group of researchers
focused on T&Is in Zambia. This aim will allow for the development of research expertise focused on the
health, social and economic impact of T&Is at key institutions in Zambia. Aim 2: To promote research around
key national priorities for T&Is in Zambia. We will enhance the production of relevant research on T&Is in
Zambia around three domains: (a) documentation and measurement of risk factors (e.g. alcohol, speeding,
emergencies); (b) the evaluation of interventions that will address major trauma and mass casualties (e.g.
humanitarian emergencies, natural disasters); and (c) exploration of the social and functional impact of T&Is
across the lifespan. Aim 3: To develop a T&I “Research to Policy (RTP) Forum” in Zambia. Under this aim, we
will use the experience of our institutional collaborations and the national standing of UNZA-SPH to promote
the utilization of research evidence on the impact of T&Is on communities to influence appropriate policy in
Zambia. We will co-host an RTP symposium in collaboration with the Zambian Ministry of Health for an annual
dialogue on T&Is; this platform will involve the focal point for T&Is in the Ministry of Health, Government of
Zambia, while UNZA will be the secretariat. Aim 4: To create a formal ‘Center for T&I research’ in Zambia. We
will complement individual training by working with UNZA to establish a center for research that provides a
home for faculty across Zambia and enhances sustainability of our efforts. This program will be housed within
the UNZA but will serve the country and will work to support research and training on T&Is. In summary, we
are proposing an innovative US-Zambia TIRP that transforms the T&I research landscape in an increasingly
research-intensive country in sub-Saharan Africa. We will implement a capacity development model for Zambia
by Zambians with technical assistance from the US to address a major gap in the health research enterprise."
10896253,"Project Summary Erythropoiesis, or the process of red cell formation, is continuous throughout life. Its
study helps elucidate erythroid disorders, most notably anemia, which accounts for 8.8% of all disability
globally. It is also an accessible model for studying fundamental questions in developmental biology. This
proposal is based on recent finding that a key erythroid cell fate decision is associated with dramatic
shortening of S phase. Cell fate decisions in some other developmental systems are similarly associated with a
faster S phase. A faster S phase might be accomplished at the cost of genomic instability, as in oncogene-
induced replicative stress. However, studies of the relationships between a physiologically faster S phase and
the DNA damage response in normal development are lacking. This project’s goal is to determine whether the
unusually fast S phase of the erythroid developmental switch entails altered DNA replication fidelity and/or
alterations in the DNA damage response.
Early erythroid progenitors, termed ‘colony-forming-unit-erythroid’ (CFU-e), undergo several self-renewal cell
divisions before transitioning into Erythroid Terminal Differentiation (ETD), where they begin to express red cell
genes. The transition from self-renewing CFU-e progenitors to maturing ETD erythroblasts is a rapid
transcriptional switch that is synchronized with, and dependent on, a single cell cycle S phase. Strikingly, the
S-phase of the CFU-e/ETD switch is of uniquely short duration, lasting only 4 hr, compared with 7 hr in
preceding CFU-e cycles, as a result of a global, 50% increase in the speed of replication forks. These changes
in S phase speed are required for the CFU-e/ETD switch; the slower S phase of CFU-e progenitors promotes
their self-renewal, while the fast S phase of early ETD promotes erythroid gene induction. It might be expected
that the fast S phase of early ETD erythroblasts would exact a ‘cost’ of increased replication fork stalling events
(‘replication stress’) and increased genomic instability. our experimental AIMS test two opposing but not
necessarily mutually exclusive hypotheses:
 Hypothesis 1: The faster S phase of early ETD is achieved at a cost of lower quality replication.
 Hypothesis 2: The faster S phase of early ETD reflects “supercharged” replication-coupled DNA repair.
AIM 1 will analyze the quality of DNA replication in fast-cycling early ETD erythroblasts. AIM 2 will determine
how the DNA damage response of fast-cycling ETD erythroblasts differs from that of their slower-cycling CFU-
e precursors. AIM 3 will determine whether the faster S phase and the altered DNA damage response of early
ETD are genetically separable."

Protein secretion is an essential component of the arsenal used by many bacterial pathogens to
invade hosts, damage tissues, and suppress immune responses. Gram-negative bacteria have
evolved sophisticated machines to secrete proteins across two membranes: the inner
membrane and outer membrane. Since discovered in 1979, the type I secretion system (T1SS)
has been identified in more than 800 bacterial genomes, and many of its substrates contribute
to the virulence of pathogens, examples being hemolysin HlyA in uropathogenic Escherichia coli,
adhesin SiiE in Salmonella enterica, and adenylate cyclase CyaA in Bordetella pertussis. The
T1SS secretes unfolded substrates from the cytoplasm to the extracellular milieu. It includes
three components: an ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC transporter), associated
periplasmic adapter proteins located in the inner membrane, and a porin in the outer membrane.
The canonical “alternating access” model cannot explain how the large protein substrates are
transported by the T1SS ABC transporter across the inner membrane. Therefore, the
mechanisms of substrate secretion at the molecular level is still obscure. The proposed
research leverages single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM), bioinformatics, in vivo
and in vitro assays to answer key questions in the field, including the structural basis of
substrate recognition, the nature of the translocation pathway, the energetics for substrate
translocation, and the regulation of the T1SS ABC transporter's activity. The studies will
substantially increase the fundamental scientific knowledge about the mechanisms of the T1SS
and provide a new basis for developing future therapeutic interventions against a broad range of
bacterial infections."
10895499,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT - PROJECT 1
The field of pharmacogenomics has progressed from the discovery of genetic variants that cause variable
function of drug metabolism enzymes to a cornerstone of clinical precision medicine. However, there are
limited data supporting drug-gene associations for children and for women during and after pregnancy. The
unique physiology of childhood and pregnancy demand validation of pharmacogenomic signals prior to clinical
implementation. These knowledge gaps are compounded for individuals from minority populations, who have
been underrepresented and thus underserved by genomic research and specifically pharmacogenomic
studies. The primary objective of this project is to advance research and support clinical implementation in
pharmacogenomics for children and pregnant women. Our work will use a community engaged approach to: 1)
illuminate knowledge of, attitudes about, and priorities for pharmacogenomics; 2) validate pharmacogenomic
associations for pediatric and maternal populations using the innovative and generalizable strategy of
electronic health records phenotyping; 3) identify and quantify variants with unknown functional consequence
in diverse individuals in order to inform future research efforts and reduce disparities. Aim 1 will assess the
knowledge and attitudes regarding pharmacogenomic testing among diverse cohorts of children with chronic
disease and pregnant women, before and after receiving pharmacogenomic test results. This aim will begin
with a Community Engagement Studio to identify strategies to facilitate and enhance inclusion of children with
chronic health conditions, pregnant women, minorities, and those with disabilities in pharmacogenomic
research. We will then perform surveys before and after pharmacogenomic testing and return of results. Aim 2
will leverage our large biobank resource to validate high-frequency drug-gene interactions in women and
children to enable evidence-based clinical implementation for these populations and identify novel signals for
further study. This aim will generate electronic health records phenotyping methods and tools to efficiently
complete the aim and facilitate future research at our site and others. Aim 3 will identify and quantify genetic
variants of unknown function in pharmacogenomic genes among children and pregnant women in a diverse
cohort of biobank participants, informing the spectrum of genomic diversity requiring characterization. Overall,
accomplishing these aims will address critical knowledge deficits for precision therapeutics for pediatric and
maternal populations."
10895501,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT- PROJECT 2
Over the past two decades, the number of women with opioid use disorder (OUD) during pregnancy and the
number of infants born affected by opioids has increased substantially. However, there remain key knowledge
gaps in our understanding of how neonatal and postpartum treatment for opioid use impacts the maternal-
infant dyad. Much of the current research around infants exposed to opioids focuses on those diagnosed with
Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS), potentially under-identifying opioid-exposed infants that don’t
develop the syndrome but are at risk for adverse outcomes. Postpartum women with OUD are at risk for
outcomes that are detrimental to both mother and infant including overdose, severe maternal morbidity, and
death. While we know medications for OUD, including buprenorphine and methadone, can improve short-term
outcomes for women, evidence of their impact on maternal outcomes and dyadic stability after delivery is
limited. Furthermore, maternal and infant wellbeing is intertwined, yet our understanding of dyadic outcomes
(e.g., retaining custody) is limited and research has primarily focused on separate mother and infant wellbeing.
Improved understanding of dyadic outcomes has the potential to inform tailored therapeutics and precision
medicine for opioid-affected dyads. To address these key knowledge gaps we will utilize data linkages and
novel data science methodologies to 1) develop and validate electronic health record-based algorithms to
identify opioid-exposed infants and their mothers, identify key covariates for dyad wellbeing, and link to state
data systems; 2) test the hypothesis that dyads with prenatal maternal treatment for OUD compared to dyads
with untreated maternal OUD have improved birth outcomes and post-natal service utilization of recommended
services in the first six months postpartum; and 3) test the hypothesis that dyads with prenatal maternal
treatment for OUD compared to dyads with untreated maternal OUD have improved dyadic stability at one-
year postpartum and whether infant treatment modifies those outcomes. This proposal will fill critical
knowledge gaps and create enduring, scalable data science methods that will foster innovation, data sharing,
and research focused on maternal-infant dyads affected by the opioid crisis."

10895507,"PROJECT SUMMARY – SUPPORT CORE
The recent widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) provides the opportunity to leverage real-
world data generated as a byproduct of healthcare for clinical discovery. EHRs contain a wealth of valuable
information, particularly for pregnant women, women who just gave birth, and for children, as these individuals
have scheduled health care visits on a frequent basis which provide a source of longitudinal data. Further,
these populations have been previously under-represented in research efforts. However, the data in EHRs are
not always easily accessible for research. Pregnancy and childhood have not been focal points for
development of phenotyping methods in EHRs. Algorithms to assess specific drug exposures, important
covariates (which may change rapidly), and outcomes (which may be population-specific) have not been
validated for obstetric or pediatric populations. The Phenotyping Support Core will provide full technical support
for phenotyping within the proposed Center and other sites of the MRPRINT Hub. In Aim 1, the Core will
support the Project 1 and Project 2 by assisting with medication exposure, therapeutic response, and adverse
event outcomes. We will develop and validate natural language processing pipelines and machine learning
approaches to extract drug outcomes. We will define and evaluate algorithms for detecting neonatal opioid
withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) and related maternal and infant outcomes. We will implement the algorithms
and organize datasets and results into common data models. In Aim 2, we will support the work of the
MPRINT-Hub by assisting with validation of findings at other sites using real-world, EHR data, including
Vanderbilt’s BioVU biobank resource. In Aim 3, we will develop and disseminate tools for EHR-based
therapeutics research for the scientific community. We will assemble a suite of existing and new analytical
tools for MPRINT research. All the tools and algorithms generated through the core will be published and
shared on PheKB and with MPRINT Hub platforms, as appropriate. The tools generated from this project will
significantly enhance our efficiency when using EHRs and offer a potential approach to identify new
phenotypes and to generate novel research hypotheses for the benefit of pediatric and maternal populations."
10898060,"Abstract
With increasing longevity in our population, dementia is widely recognized as an impending public health crisis.
Lewy body dementia (LBD), encompassing dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson disease dementia
(PDD), is the second most common cause. LBD is characterized by abnormal aggregation and accumulation of
a protein, α-synuclein (aSyn). PDD and DLB are clinically separated only by the relative timing of the onset of
parkinsonism and dementia. At present, advances in the treatment of these conditions are critically hampered
by the lack of non-invasive, inexpensive biomarkers that can provide accurate diagnostic and prognostic
information. This situation may soon be resolved, as in recent years it has become apparent, through our own
studies and those of others, that biopsies of peripheral tissue sites can detect diagnostically significant aSyn.
Our project will assess aSyn in punch biopsies of the skin. Our preliminary data from new “seeding assay”
methods including real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) and protein misfolding cyclic amplification
(PMCA), from autopsy-confirmed LBD subjects, indicate high sensitivity and specificity for predicting the
presence of aSyn in the skin of affected subjects. Further work is necessary to confirm these results in living
subjects with these conditions, which is the objective of this proposed project. We will biopsy, twice during a
four year period, 90 subjects with aSyn disease, 30 each with PD, PDD and DLB, as well as 30 normal control
subjects. Two independent laboratories will blindly perform separately-developed seeding assays, rigorously
testing the interlaboratory reliability and providing estimates of aSyn density change over time. The seeding
assay results will be compared with those obtained by the current gold-standard biopsy method,
immunohistochemistry (IHC). All subjects will receive cognitive and movement disorder assessments at two
timepoints in this four year project, enabling comparisons of assay measures with cognitive and motor decline
rates. Many of the subjects will be enrolled in the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders
(AZSAND), a longitudinal clinicopathological study with an autopsy rate exceeding 90%. This will allow, in a
substantial subset, eventual neuropathological confirmation of the molecular cause of parkinsonism and
dementia in each subject."
10889974,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background. The risk of stillbirth, preterm delivery, low birthweight and other adverse pregnancy outcomes is
extremely high in Sub-Saharan African countries including Botswana, especially among HIV-positive women.
Daily iron and folic acid supplementation during pregnancy could reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes by
reducing maternal anemia. However, the effectiveness of supplementation in subgroups defined by HIV status,
anemia, gestational age, and other clinical, demographic and geographic factors remains unknown and
compliance with supplementation guidelines is variable (<50% in Botswana). Cost-effective interventions to
provide supplementation to pregnant women in Botswana and other resource-limited settings should be
designed to address key barriers to successful supplementation and to reach subgroups that would benefit
most from intervention. This K01 provides a unique opportunity to address this gap in the literature.
Candidate Overview. My long-term career objective is to become an independent investigator who specializes
in interventions to improve maternal and child health in resource-limited settings. My background is in
applications of epidemiologic methods to evaluate effects of HIV treatment strategies in adults and infants. A
K01 award will provide the necessary additional training and experience needed to become an expert in the
design, implementation, and evaluation of interventions to improve pregnancy outcomes in HIV-positive
women and underserved populations.
Career Development and Training Plan. My education program includes structured course work,
professional conferences, directed readings, and a research project with specific aims timed to coincide with
these activities. My mentorship team includes international experts who specialize in areas related to my
training goals: Dr. Scott Braithwaite (decision science), Dr. Roger Shapiro (HIV and maternal and child health
in Botswana), Dr. Donna Shelley (intervention development and implementation), and Dr. Carolyn Berry
(qualitative methods).
Environment. NYU School of Medicine provides an exceptional environment for me to conduct the proposed
study, obtain additional training and mentorship, and successfully transition to an independent investigator.
Research Strategy. Using the data and infrastructure from an ongoing birth outcomes surveillance study in
Botswana consisting of data from over 130,000 births, my study will: 1) estimate the effect of iron and folic acid
supplementation during pregnancy on adverse pregnancy outcomes by HIV status, anemia, gestational age,
and other key subgroups to identify populations that would benefit most from intervention; 2) assess barriers to
supplementation during and prior to pregnancy; 3) optimize a hypothetical intervention to provide
supplementation using computer simulation; and 4) develop and test the feasibility of an intervention to provide
supplementation to pregnant women in Botswana."

unraveled, the mechanisms that underlie advanced age as the most significant risk factor associated with these
disease states are relatively unknown. This is an important issue because single interventions that impact
mechanisms of aging would be expected to ameliorate or eliminate multiple pathologies and diseases. We are,
therefore, not just talking about extending lifespan; advances in understanding the basic biology of aging
would have tremendous general health benefits as well. Our understanding of mammalian aging has been
greatly stimulated over the past decade by research in simple model systems. Arguably, today’s most effective
aging-related interventions in mice target sirtuin genes, as well as TOR and insulin/IGF signaling pathways, all
of which were first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster.
 In recent years, molecular neuroscience, often using simple model organisms like Drosophila, has provided
a well-defined framework for dissecting the causes and consequences of motivated behaviors. Homeostatic
drives are as influential in this process as are rewarding experiences, and the neurons and neural circuits that
influence motivation for foraging, mating, and many other behaviors also affect cellular pathways throughout
the body, even those thought to be largely cell-autonomous. We have evidence that the circuits and neural
states that encode feeding motivations are important modulators of aging. More specifically, our hypothesis is
that specific mechanisms that evaluate internal and external nutrient availability and initiate physiological
changes associated with states such as hunger and satiety play important roles in the modulation of behavior
and lifespan.
 Harnessing the neurobiology of simple model systems to study the impact of how physiological decisions
are made in response to evaluated energy status will yield insights into the broad influence of nutrients on
longevity across taxa, including humans. It will also provide an understanding of the molecular details about
how neuronal inputs orchestrate cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms to insure survival and
health in a complex organism. The innovative nature of this proposal, which derives from the uniquely
appropriate tools available in Drosophila together with a novel perspective about the importance of evaluative
and motivational neural circuits on lifespan, provides the creativity and experimental power to develop and
test hypotheses about the cell non-autonomous control of aging that have not been previously considered. In
addition to providing an opportunity to discover basic mechanisms of aging, our work may also lead to
creative intervention strategies that ameliorate aging-related functional decline in humans."

 Establishing mechanisms for increasing the pipeline of scientists who conduct research in aging and Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias (ADRD), and mentoring these scientists, are national public health priorities. This is
evidenced in the long-term goals of the National Institute on Aging (NIA), as well as Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), and Alzheimer’s Association “State and Local Public Health Partnerships to Address Dementia: The
2018-2023 Road Map”. The proposed project responds to these priorities through the establishment of an annual
conference entitled, “Promoting High-Impact Alzheimer’s Disease Research through the Use of Statewide Registries:
Expanding Diversity in Aging Research.” This conference series also addresses the NIA’s ADRD Implementation Milestone
4.S: “To improve and increase training, including for individuals who are members of under-represented populations, and
of different career levels of scholars who conduct health disparities research in AD/ADRD.”
 The specific aims of the conference series are to: 1: Provide a forum for underrepresented minority (URM) and non-
URM researchers to learn how to conduct high-impact ADRD research using statewide registries; 2: Provide a
mechanism for senior faculty/experts to mentor junior URM researchers in AD registry research through the submission
of a) an abstract for presentation at the following year’s R13 conference, and b) a manuscript to a peer-reviewed
journal; 3: Provide a mechanism to support ongoing networking among URM and non-URM researchers; and 4:
Conduct process and outcome evaluations of the program, making modifications as needed.
 The proposed conference series leverages the MPIs’ successful leadership in providing mentoring to URM and non-
URM faculty and undergraduate students through several active NIA-supported mechanisms, including the Alzheimer’s-
related Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR; Carolina Center on Alzheimer’s Disease and Minority
Research (CCADMR); MPIs Levkoff & Friedman, Research Education Component Lead Ingram), the South Carolina-
Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (SC-ADAR; PI Levkoff) program, and the CDC’s Healthy Brain Research Network (PI
Friedman). Similar to our NIA-funded projects, the conference series will extend our statewide collaborations with
Clemson University and the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), and three Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) - Claflin University, Allen University, and South Carolina State University. Additional partners
include the only active statewide AD registries in the United States (US), which are located in Georgia, West Virginia, and
South Carolina (the last of which is housed within an office that is co-directed by MPI Friedman). Additional NIA-funded
partners include researchers affiliated with the UCLA RCMAR Coordinating Center, University of Southern California
(USC) AD-RCMAR, and USC/UCLA Center on Biodemography and Population Health. The conference series will
contribute to our ultimate goal of diversifying the research workforce in aging and ADRD and advancing the science on
ADRD disparities."
10893478,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The retina is an adaptable circuit that is capable of rapidly changing its processing mode with changing
stimulus conditions. This is an enormous undertaking because the retina has to process an unpredictable and
wide-ranging assortment of inputs. An understanding of how local neuron dynamics are coordinated to
produce and alter global network computations is needed for understanding how neural circuits of the brain
are able to flexibly integrate information from many different areas. Advances on this front will have a broad
impact on the ability to design targeted therapies to ameliorate brain disorders. The long-term goal of the
proposed work is to understand how local adaptation mechanisms impact the computational function of
neural circuits like the retina. Signals from the photoreceptors are processed along parallel pathways in the
early part of the retina circuit and later combined. The properties of the visual inputs can modulate the how
these inputs are processed via local adaptation mechanisms. This kind of adaptation has consequences for the
manner in which visual inputs are encoded and processed in the early part of the visual system. The proposed
research during the mentored phase aims to characterize the rod pathway adaptation that leads to a switch in
computational processing of inputs and to determine the consequences for the spatiotemporal encoding of
visual inputs. I will characterize adaptation through the rod-AII pathway for a range of luminance conditions to
build a predictive model and to then determine how this adaptation affects the feature-sensitivity of ON α-
ganglion cells under different luminance conditions. The independent phase research will build on the progress
made during the mentored phase. There are several distinct ganglion cell types that convey information to the
brain about particular visual features - similar to the higher order processing that takes place in the visual
cortex. I will conduct studies to determine how ON and OFF α-ganglion cell types use the same circuitry to
produce computations that are fundamentally distinct beyond their opposite polarities. The objective of this
work is to obtain a better understanding of how mechanisms of local adaptation can reconfigure the
computational functions of diverse circuit components. The University of Washington offers the ideal
environment for my career development and for pursuing this highly interdisciplinary project. I have two
outstanding mentors, an experimentalist and a theorist. I will receive training to become proficient in retina
electrophysiology experiments and take courses to hone my quantitative skills. This training will prepare me to
launch my own lab with an interdisciplinary focus. The proposed research will establish my expertise in the
effects of biophysical mechanisms on sensory circuit computation."
10898834,"Project Summary/ Abstract
More than 50 million people aged 65 and above suffer in vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID).
The incidence of VCID is projected to nearly triple by 2050, which will cost more than 2 trillion US dollars in
health and social care expenditures. Yet, there are no interventions to treat or prevent cognitive decline in the
elderly. Microvascular endothelial dysfunction is a critical contributor to age-related VCID. Functional alterations
in the microvascular endothelial cells lead to neurovascular uncoupling responses, the lack of a critical process
of adjustment of cerebral blood flow required to support neuronal activity. Further, structural alterations in
endothelial cells negatively affect the integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB), which leads to increased capillary
permeability and neuroinflammation. Endothelial dysfunction also contributes to decreased capillary density
leading to a reduction in basal CBF. These pathological changes in the endothelial phenotype precedes the
onset of cognitive decline in aged humans, suggesting that interventions that maintain or restore cerebrovascular
health would be effective for the prevention and treatment of age-related VCID. Adipose tissue plays a pivotal
role in the interplay between metabolism and aging. Emerging evidence links increased thermogenesis in the
adipose tissue with extended longevity. Activation of the thermogenic program results in remodeling of both white
and brown adipose tissue marked by increased fuel utilization and insulin sensitivity. It also results in an overall
improvement in systemic inflammatory milieu and a favorable adipokine profile, which could have beneficial
effects on the aging cerebral microvasculature. Our preliminary studies provide prima facie evidence that
activation of adipose tissue thermogenesis improves cerebromicrovascular function and positively impacts
cognition in aged mice. However, the circulating mediators or the cerebromicrovascular mechanisms behind
thermogenesis-mediated positive cognitive outcome in aging are not known. Our central hypothesis is that
activation of thermogenic program corrects metabolic dysfunction and ameliorates systemic
inflammation, thereby improving microvascular endothelial function and preserving cognitive integrity
in aging. To address this hypothesis the following aims are proposed: Aim 1: Characterize thermogenesis-
induced alterations in metabolic and inflammatory milieu in aging. The thermogenesis mediated alterations
in adipose tissue secretome will have beneficial effects on overall metabolism and systemic inflammation in
aging. Aim 2: Determine the impact of thermogenesis on microvascular endothelial structure and
function in aging. Prolonged activation of thermogenesis can improve cerebrovascular function and structure
in aging and lead to improved cognitive health. The successful completion of the proposed studies will identify
novel strategies to counteract age-related VCID."

The Montana Cancer Consortium (MCC) is an independent, nonprofit organization whose mission is to bring
state-of-the-art cancer care to Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming through National Cancer Institute (NCI)
sponsored clinical research. MCC coordinates, supports and improves the activities of physicians and other
cancer care professionals, cancer centers and hospitals across the service area to maximize patient access to
the highest levels of cancer care with a focus on access to clinical trials. In addition, MCC helps to design and
influence cancer care delivery research through continued participation that informs and speeds validated care
innovations into clinical practice. The region has been characterized as `mega-rural' with limited access to care
due to the vastness of the geography, lack of university-based treatment and research facilities, and lack of
primary care providers. Montana, Idaho and Wyoming are home to seven, five, and one American Indian
Reservations respectively, where issues of poverty, distance, and cultural taboos surrounding cancer care
discussion and treatment create unique disparities to prevention, early diagnosis, treatment and survivorship of
cancer. The overall goal of MCC is to increase access to clinical trials in the service area while improving the
delivery of cancer care through research. This is accomplished through inclusiveness of membership,
communication, education, a commitment to quality, and participation in national clinical trial initiatives. The
MCC NCORP Community Site consists of 10 primary affiliate sites and nine sub-affiliates that collectively serve
nearly two million residents in an area covering over 200,000 square miles. Membership includes 60 oncology
investigators representing all cancer care specialty areas. MCC is a member in good standing with the four
adult research bases, and is poised to provide and support expanded access to state-of-the-art cancer
treatment, control, prevention, screening, surveillance and care delivery through NCI-sponsored clinical trials.
Strong leadership, an involved network of member physicians and dedicated affiliate sites strengthens MCC as
an NCORP Community Site."

The Sanford Community Cancer Program (SCCP) remains committed to its original goals and aims as stated in
our 2013 application. The SCCP continues to increase patient participation in cancer control, prevention, care
delivery, treatment, and imaging studies across its expanding network. The rural communities of the upper
Midwest and Central Plains represent a large underserved population for cancer treatment, care delivery and
clinical trials (PMID:24097196 PMID:22046848 PMID:19621978). The reasons for this disparity are multi-
factorial but a main obstacle is access to services in rural regional areas. Sanford Health has developed a
network of hospitals, cancer centers and clinics to provide high-quality, multi-disciplinary cancer treatment,
clinical trials, and cancer care delivery to this underserved area. Sanford Health has designated cancer care as
a Center of Excellence; elevating cancer care as a top priority to the patients it serves. The SCCP has expanded
from five to seven components in the past five years, adding two new components to improve trial access in rural
and underserved areas. It is hypothesized that this disparity in care for this rural population can be improved by
utilizing the organized SCCP network community. This proposal describes how the NCI Community Oncology
Research Program (NCORP) partnership will help deliver clinical care and offer clinical trials across the rural
area served by the SCCP. This will be accomplished through the following aims:
 1. Maintain and enhance robust accrual to NCI Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) supported
 clinical trials through seven components.
 2. Address disparities in clinical trial accrual in underserved and underrepresented populations to
 increase participation.
 3. Cultivate innovative access points to address barriers to clinical trial accrual through outreach
 and telemedicine.
 4. Expand Cancer Care Delivery Research infrastructure.
Through these four aims the Sanford Community Cancer Program will continue to offer NCI clinical trials and
provide state-of-the-art cancer treatment and cancer care delivery to millions of people across six states in rural
America. The SCCP's ability to provide clinical trials through outreach and telemedicine to this underserved rural
population of patients increases their opportunity for participation in a trial as a treatment option. Telemedicine
services are currently provided in existing Sanford Clinics in rural communities to deliver oncology consultations,
surveillance exams and chemotherapy oversight. As a community based health care organization, the SCCP
will participate in the development and implementation of cancer care delivery research to better understand and
improve patient outcomes. The SCCP will design and develop additional community based investigator-initiated
Cancer Care Delivery pilot projects with the goal to collaborate with the SCCP's primary Research Bases."

10809673,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults across the lifespan is a leading cause of disability worldwide.
Cognitive dysfunction is highly prevalent in MDD and is associated with functional impairments and reduced
quality of life. Cognitive dysfunction has been noted across non-emotional, “cold” cognitive functions, such as
executive function, memory, and attention, as well as emotionally-laden, “hot” cognitive functions, such as
emotion processing, negative attentional biases, reward processing, and social cognition. Despite ample
evidence of impairments associated with hot cognitive function, behaviors, and associated neural circuity,
limited information exists regarding hot cognitive function in adults across the lifespan with MDD. Given the
importance of cognitive dysfunction on disease course and overall functioning in MDD, it is critical to identify
mechanisms of action and targeted treatment approaches that will improve associated cognitive dysfunction
and achieve the ultimate goal of improving overall disease course, functioning, and quality of life. Identification
of regional brain network alterations associated with particular hot and cold cognitive functions and treatments
that modify these regions will move us closer toward mechanism-based personalized medicine and improved
patient outcomes. A first critical step in this long-term endeavor and goal of this R21 study is to better
characterize hot cognitive dysfunction in MDD, inform potential effects of age on these dysfunctions,
and elucidate associated underlying neurocircuitry in older adults. In the proposed pilot study, we further
our prior work in adults across the lifespan with MDD and cold cognitive impairment by examining the
understudied area of hot cognitive function. This clinically significant and innovative 2-year preliminary project
has two aims: 1) Establish and integrate hot and cold cognitive dysfunction in adults across the lifespan, and 2)
Establish and compare specific brain networks underlying hot and cold cognitive tasks. The proposed study
engages an interdisciplinary team with diverse expertise including clinical neuropsychology,
cognitive/behavioral neuroscience, neuroimaging, and biostatistics. Through the synthesis of clinical metrics,
hot and cold cognitive metrics, and resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG), we will characterize hot
cognitive dysfunction in MDD, examine potential effects of age, and inform associated underlying
neurocircuitry. The new knowledge gained in this pilot study will allow us to develop a program of research that
will then use non-invasive neuromodulation technology (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation) to perturb
neurocircuitry and confirm the mechanisms underlying both hot and cold cognitive function. Following
mechanistic confirmation, subsequent investigations will develop mechanism-based targeted treatment(s) to
improve cognitive impairments. These investigations have strong clinical significance and innovation for adults
across the lifespan with MDD as they will lead to new and mechanism-based personalized therapeutics,
remediate cognitive dysfunction, and optimize overall health."
10767989,"Tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) are ectopic structures that resemble secondary lymphoid organs, but
arise de novo in response to infection, inflammation, autoimmunity and cancer. TLO function is context
dependent, exacerbating pathology of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, while providing immune
protection following bacterial and viral infections, and in various cancers. Thus, identifying the precise signals
and cells that drive beneficial TLO formation while avoiding pathogenesis is a highly significant objective that will
define novel targets for developing new immune-modulating drugs. Inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid
tissue (iBALT) is a type of TLO that forms in the lungs in response to infection, inflammation and pulmonary
damage, where its function ranges from pathologic to protective depending on the nature and context of the
disease. In the case of infection by respiratory viruses such as influenza, iBALT provides protective immunity,
supporting therapeutic induction of BALT formation as a strategy to promote immunity and enhance vaccine
efficacy in the lung. However, a major roadblock to pursuing this approach is the lack of identified therapeutic
targets that can be exploited to promote protective BALT formation while avoiding potentially destructive
inflammatory responses in lung tissue. In our ongoing studies of NF-κB signaling in immune homeostasis, we
created mice lacking IKKa in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). These mice lack all lymph nodes, but remarkably
form spontaneous BALT in the absence of inflammation, emphysema or tissue damage. Following infection with
influenza virus, IKKa LEC-KO mice only transiently lost weight and all animals survived, whereas control mice
lost extensive body weight and more than half died. These findings support an exciting new model in which
inhibition of IKKa in LECs would drive non-pathogenic BALT, thereby providing prophylactic protection by acting
as a “command center” to coordinate a rapid and enhanced local anti-viral immune response. In this proposal
we will leverage these new findings to address the hypothesis that “targeting LEC-intrinsic IKKa promotes
protective non-pathogenic BALT formation”. Accordingly, we will pursue the following two specific aims: (1) To
determine how IKKa regulates pulmonary lymphatic vessel function; (2) To establish a new inducible in vivo
model to drive non-pathogenic BALT formation. We will use this model to determine if limiting LEC-intrinsic IKKa
deletion to the lungs can augment protection by increasing local protection, while leaving lymph node and
lymphatic function in other tissues intact. These studies will directly impact our understanding of the signals that
regulate the immune function of pulmonary lymphatics and will provide crucial insight into the feasibility of
therapeutically targeting LEC-intrinsic IKKa to provide immunoprophylactic protection against respiratory
pathogens. As therapeutic strategies to exploit TLOs for immunotherapy are gaining traction, our findings will
have a wider impact for other diseases in which TLOs play a protective immunological role."

Candidate: David Isaacs, MD, MPH is Assistant Professor in the Department of Neurology at Vanderbilt
University Medical Center. During his faculty tenure, he has demonstrated enthusiasm and aptitude for patient-
centered research, with emphasis on non-motor aspects of movement disorders. Notable early career
highlights include founding Vanderbilt’s Adult Tourette Syndrome (TS) Clinic and co-directing Vanderbilt’s
Tourette Association of America (TAA) Center of Excellence; securing multiple extra- and intra-mural grants,
including the TAA Young Investigator Award to support research into sensory phenomena in TS; and serving
as site principal investigator for industry-sponsored clinical trials in TS. He seeks to become a leading
researcher in neurophysiologic mechanisms of non-motor symptoms in TS and other movement disorders.
Research Project: TS affects 0.5-0.8% of school-aged children, one-third of whom suffer bothersome tics into
adulthood. Tics are the defining feature of TS, but sensory symptoms are widespread. In particular, over 50%
of children and 80% of adults with TS report sensory over-responsivity (SOR), defined as heightened
awareness of and behavioral reactivity to sensory stimuli. SOR is an integral facet of the TS phenotype, but
significant knowledge gaps surround its clinical significance and neurobiological underpinnings. This proposal
seeks to clarify the mechanistic bases of SOR in TS (Aims 1 and 2) and to determine whether SOR is a risk
marker for more severe clinical course in TS (Aim 3). To achieve Aims 1 and 2, Dr. Isaacs will use quantitative
electroencephalography (EEG) and multi-modal autonomic measurement to assess neurophysiologic response
to auditory and tactile stimuli in adults with TS. To achieve Aim 3, he will use validated rating scales to assess
motor, sensory, and psychiatric symptoms in adolescents with TS at two time points: baseline and 2 years.
Study results will deepen insight into TS pathophysiology and identify risk markers for more severe TS course.
Career Development Plan and Goals: With guidance from his Scientific Steering Committee, Dr. Isaacs has
created a curriculum incorporating formal coursework, workshops, conferences, and individualized training with
mentors and collaborators to adequately prepare himself for independent research in the neurophysiologic
basis of non-motor aspects of movement disorders. His short-term career goals are to develop proficiency in 1)
measurement of sensory and neuropsychiatric symptoms; 2) event-related potentials and quantitative EEG
methodology; and 3) psychophysiological techniques complementary to EEG.
Environment: Vanderbilt University Medical Center is an optimal academic environment for nurturing Dr.
Isaacs’ maturation into a fully-fledged independent researcher. The institution has an exceptional track record
for fostering productive, independently funded, and internationally renowned clinician-scientists. The primary
mission of Vanderbilt’s Clinical and Translational Science Award is provision of infrastructure for clinical
research excellence, with an entire arm devoted to training and career development."
10866498,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term goal of the proposed career development award is to provide the training necessary to develop
an independent research program investigating how chronic pain is related to dementia risk. Such research is
timely given recent links between chronic pain and a doubled risk of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease
(AD). Chronic pain may lead to general, AD-unspecific, neurodegeneration that increases susceptibility to AD
dementia, supported by studies linking chronic pain to smaller brain volumes in adults. Alternatively, recent
animal studies suggest that the biological processes underneath chronic pain may promote amyloidosis and
tau seeding, but there is less focus on the relationship of chronic pain and AD-related neurodegeneration in
humans. A training emphasis focused on incorporating biological measures will complement my existing
expertise in chronic pain, cognitive aging, and advanced statistical analysis to conduct this research program.
The proposed training goals are to: 1) attain proficiency in neuroanatomy and neuroimaging relevant to aging
and AD; 2) obtain competence in assessment and biology of pain; and 3) establish a multidisciplinary program
studying brain changes and AD risk. Training will involve a combination of formal coursework, and hands-on
activities, and discussion with mentors and other field experts. The Department of Psychiatry at the University
of California San Diego is an ideal environment for the proposed training activities with access to world-renown
researchers and research centers focused on chronic pain, neuroimaging, and Alzheimer's disease as well as
an excellent departmental record of career development for junior researchers. The proposed project will
examine how chronic pain relates to indicators of general neurodegeneration and AD-related
neurodegeneration across independent samples of older adults including the Framingham Heart Study, the
Religious Orders Study/Memory Aging Project, and the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging. Aim 1 will examine
how chronic pain relates to indicators of general neurodegeneration, including brain age, an estimation of age
based on thickness/volume across a wide arrange of AD-unspecific brain regions, as well as neurofilament
light, a protein released during neurodegeneration. Aim 2 will examine how chronic is associated with
indicators of AD-related neurodegeneration. Indicators include AD brain signatures capturing thickness/volume
and mean diffusivity in AD-vulnerable brain regions, biomarkers of amyloid and tau, and diagnosis of mild
cognitive impairment and AD dementia. Analyses will help clarify how chronic pain contributes to dementia risk,
either through general neurodegeneration or AD-related neurodegeneration. Multiple datasets will improve the
rigor of analyses by allowing for replication."

Research: Peripheral neuropathy, a condition involving damage to the peripheral nervous system (PNS), affects more than
20 million people in the United States. Protection and restoration of PNS is of particular relevance upon barrier tissue injury,
a leading cause of PNS damage, to promote somatosensory recovery and regulate pain. Of note, injury and repair at the
barrier tissues occur in the context of commensal microbiota-specific T cell responses. Indeed, reactive commensal-specific
T cells promote wound healing and sensory neuron regeneration upon injury. However, how commensal-specific T cells
contribute to PNS restoration upon injury, and what the long-term consequences of the T cell response are on pain sensation,
represent a fundamental yet unexplored area of research. My preliminary data show that Interleukin 17A (IL-17A) produced
by commensal-specific T cells signals to sensory neurons via the IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA), the transcription of which is
upregulated in injured neurons, promoting sensory nerve regeneration. However, neither the upstream factors controlling
IL-17RA upregulation nor the downstream signaling and transcriptomic regulation has been formally studied in injured
neurons. My overarching hypothesis is that commensal-specific T cells control PNS regeneration in the skin upon injury
and regulate long-term pain sensation via IL-17A/IL-17RA signaling. To assess my hypothesis and the potential
neurotrophic function of IL-17A, I will study how IL-17A enhances PNS regeneration (Aim 1 and 2), and the long-term
consequences on pain sensation (Aim 3) in three complementary mouse models of nerve injury: (i) ear skin punch, for
mechanistic insights into nerve regeneration; (ii) sciatic nerve transection (SNT), for therapeutic evaluation of IL-17A; and
(iii) footpad skin injury, which allows the use of standard tests to asses pain sensation. Career goals: My long-term goal is
to become an independent investigator at an academic institution, where I will explore the communication between the
immune and peripheral nervous systems at barrier sites in response to the microbiota, ultimately translating my findings
into novel therapies to treat neuroimmune-related disabilities. I also aspire to become an inspirational mentor and teacher.
Career development: I will meet weekly with Dr. Belkaid and discuss my progress with collaborators every 6 months for
the duration of the award. Before the K award, I will improve my bioinformatics skills (advance bioinformatics courses),
attend at least to 2 international conferences (oral presentation), attend NIH training courses (teaching and mentoring
workshops and laboratory management). Environment: The NIH Intramural Research Program has more than 1,200 PIs
conducting basic, translational, and clinical research. It is a unique environment with resources for the career development
(including microbiome, pain study center and immunology core facilities, and frequent seminars and opportunities to engage
with colleagues/mentors). Prior to the K award, I will work in the laboratory of Dr. Belkaid, which is a BSL-2 research
space and is adequately equipped to conduct the proposed experiments. Furthermore, I have assembled a mentoring team
that will complement my expertise in neuroimmunology and closely oversee my training in microscopy (Dr. Ron Germain)
and somatosensory neurons (Dr. Alexander Chesler and Dr. Claire le Pichon)."

The overarching goal of the Dietary Biomarker Development Centers (DBDCs) is to develop objective
biomarkers of dietary intake that can complement current dietary intake assessment methods. Liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry- (LC-MS-) based profiling technologies provide a powerful means
to profile food biomarkers, including nutrient and non-nutrient molecules directly derived from food as well as
their metabolites generated via metabolic transformation by both the host and the microbiome. We propose
creating a Metabolomics Core for the DBDC at Harvard University that will use a suite of five complimentary
nontargeted LC-MS methods to discover new food biomarkers in acute feeding studies conducted by the
Intervention Core and to develop targeted assays for biomarker validation studies in larger human cohorts in
conjunction with the Biomarkers Project. The Core will leverage existing expertise and resources of the
Metabolomics Platform at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and will use equipment capable of high
resolution and accurate mass (HRAM) for hybrid analyses of compounds of known identity, confirmed using
reference standards, and thousands of peaks from yet to be characterized molecules. The Core will use a
structure elucidation workflow that incorporates a dedicated Thermo ID-X LC-MS system for extensive
acquisition of product ion spectra (MS/MS) coupled with a machine learning-based structure prediction
workflow to efficiently determine identities of important unknowns. Once new food biomarkers have been
identified, the Core will develop targeted triple quadrupole MS-based assays using stored plasma and urine
samples from a human intervention trial (164 participants in OmniHeart) and cohorts (600 in LVS and 450 in
SOLNAS) in the Biomarkers Project."

determining the final design and analytical strategies for the biomarker analysis and performance evaluation.
Aim 3: To manage and maintain large datasets and ensure timely data sharing and submission to the DCC.
This DAC will be responsible for managing the data entry, cleaning and analyzing the data generated by our
DBDC. The DAC will work together with other DBDCs and DCC to harmonize data across platforms,
standardize data management, QC, and analytic methods across DBDCs. Aim 4: To interface nutrition,
epidemiology, bioinformatics/biostatistics, and metabolomics, and ensure that cutting-edge measurement error
correction models and multi-omics integrations are incorporated into future nutritional epidemiologic studies of
disease outcomes. Whenever appropriate, all analyses will assess specific effects by sex and across different
racial/ethnic groups. As part of the transdisciplinary team of the DBDC at Harvard University, the DAC will
develop and curate calibrated biomarkers, refined clinical phenotypes and summary statistics for use in future
epidemiological analyses of food intake and prospective associations with disease incidence and other clinical
phenotypes of interest, allowing measurement error corrections and further integration with multi-omics
datasets, such as gut microbiota and genome-wide association studies in existing large cohort studies at
Harvard."

Familial Parkinson’s disease (PD) protein DJ-1 mutations are linked to mitochondrial deficits and
early onset PD but the exact mechanisms are unclear. We have found that mutations in DJ-1 and
DJ-1 knock out increase mitochondrial uncoupling and hamper extension and branching of
dopaminergic neuronal processes. The uncoupling is associated with abnormal ATP synthase
efficiency and stoichiometry. The changes in ATP synthase are also associated with mitochondrial
morphological changes including changes in cristae number, mitochondrial length and
mitochondrial biogenesis. New protein synthesis is crucial to repair and maintain dopaminergic
endings in the striatum and for normal dopamine release capacity. The activation of new protein
synthesis is in response to cues such as growth factors or neuronal stimulation, but we
hypothesize that new protein synthesis fails to occur when the stoichiometry of the ATP synthase
is abnormal. In keeping with this, we find that protein synthesis levels are very low in patient cells
and in DJ-1 KO mouse neurons. DJ-1 is bound to ATP synthase β subunit and ATP synthase β
subunit mRNA. We therefore hypothesize that the mechanism of decreased growth and branching
of DJ-1 deficient dopaminergic neurons is related to a lack of DJ-1 targeted, mitochondrially-
regulated, mRNAs that are required for neuronal growth, repair and plasticity of dopaminergic
cells. If we can restore the normal rate of protein synthesis downstream of DJ-1 in a spatially and
temporally precise manner, we hypothesize we will slow neuronal ending degradation in DJ-1
mutant patients and preserve dopamine release capability. In keeping with this, we have now
restored protein synthesis rates in patient cells by overexpression of ATP synthase β subunit. We
now plan to determine if we can rescue low protein synthesis rates and neuronal growth in DJ-1
KO neurons, in neurons expressing mutant DJ-1 and in vivo in DJ-1 KO animals. We will do this
by overexpression of ATP synthase β subunit by AAV (viral) delivery in neurons. In vivo, we will
restore the normal coupling of mitochondria by crossing the DJ-1 KO mice with a low c-subunit
leak KI mouse. We will restore the normal ATP synthase stoichiometry in vivo by crossing the DJ-
1 KO mouse with a mouse overexpressing ATP synthase β subunit. We hope to preserve
neuronal endings in the striatum and prevent the onset of dysfunctional movement in the mice.
Our observations suggest a connection between ATP synthase complex stoichiometry, protein
synthesis rates and PD. Our plan comprises a promising new strategy to develop therapies for
PD patients."

 The HER1 and/or HER3 receptors are overexpressed in most triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), a
subtype of breast cancer that lacks estrogen receptor, progesterone, and HER2 expression and is associated
with poor prognosis and a high lung and brain metastasis rate. Chemotherapy is the mainstay of TNBC treatment.
Our long-term goal is to develop more effective therapy for this aggressive subtype of breast cancer. In this
proposal, we aim to develop a novel crosslinking-based targeted therapy. For this purpose, we will create a
series of multi-functional DNA-affibody-drug nanoparticles containing multiple copies of HER1 and/or HER3
specific affibody molecules covalently coupled to a DNA nanostructure, of which the latter binds to tens of small
molecule drugs such as THZ1. In the presence of these nanoparticles, HER1+ and/or HER3+ TNBC cells will be
tightly bound together, thus preventing metastasis in its initial stage. In the cross-linked TNBC cell clusters, the
small molecule anticancer agent THZ1 reversibly bound to the nanoparticles will be released slowly, resulting in
killing of crosslinked TNBC cells. These nanoparticles can bind to HER1+ and/or HER3+ TNBC cells in primary
tumors, metastatic sites, and circulation. In our preliminary study, cultured HER1+ TNBC cells were crosslinked
together to form cell clusters with a 96% crosslinking efficiency, 99% migration inhibition, and 90% invasion
inhibition by a DNA-4ZHER1-THZ1 nanoparticle (drug-to-cargo ratio is 50).
 To enhance the efficiency and overcome the resistance to HER1 inhibitors, a novel DNA-2ZHER1-2ZHER3-THZ1
nanoparticle that targets dual HER1 and HER3 will be synthesized and tested in this study. Our design and
hypothesis will be tested with the following specific aims: In specific aim 1, we will prepare a DNA-2ZHER1-2ZHER3-
drug nanoparticle for targeting HER1- and/or HER3-overexpressing TNBC. In specific aim 2, we will evaluate
the inhibition of HER1- and HER3-overexpressing TNBC cell growth and metastasis by the DNA-2ZHER1-2ZHER3-
drug nanoparticle in vitro. In specific aim 3, we will study distribution and pharmacokinetics of selected DNA-
2ZHER1-2ZHER3-drug nanoparticle in healthy mice, and to evaluate its suppression of mammary tumor growth and
metastasis in TNBC xenograft models.
 If successful, this innovative approach will open a new avenue for developing new therapy for treatment of
TNBC. The pilot study will lay a foundation for further studies to investigate the utilities and mechanisms of the
new class of anticancer agents for targeted therapy."

Human insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is a highly conserved dimeric zinc metalloprotease that hydrolyzes
various peptide substrates, such as insulin, amyloid-β (Aβ), glucagon, amylin, and HIV-1 p6. It is implicated in
several physiological and pathological processes, including insulin catabolism, amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance,
development of type II diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as well as cognitive disorders and glucose
intolerance observed among people living with HIV. Surprisingly, in addition to hydrolyzing Aβ, IDE also acts as
a nonproteolytic chaperone against Aβ, resulting in its sequestration, followed by its controlled disposal. We
recently investigated the interactions of Aβ and HIV-1 p6 with catalytically inactive IDE using relaxation-based
solution NMR methods. We uncovered that modulation of intermolecular interactions allows IDE to differentiate
between non-amyloidogenic p6 and amyloidogenic Aβ. We also discovered that catalytically inactive IDE
prevented Aβ fibrillization at substoichiometric concentrations. The projects in this R21 proposal expand upon
these discoveries and will carry out innovative structure-function studies of IDE. Specifically, we will address two
outstanding questions in the field of IDE structural biology: the allosteric modulation of its catalytic activity (aim
1) and its remarkable nonproteolytic chaperone activity against Aβ (aim 2). Aim 1 is centered on our hypothesis
that substrate-induced closure of one IDE subunit will accelerate the opening of the other, allowing the products
to be released or substrate captured, and will provide key insights into how the substrate triggers these
conformational transitions as well as the complex network of intrasubunit and intersubunit interactions that
govern the catalytic activity of IDE. Under aim 2, we will generate a detailed quantitative picture of how inactive
IDE alters Aβ aggregation kinetics using a synergistic combination of fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy and
mathematical models based on the framework of microscopic rate laws and chemical kinetics. Extensive
preliminary results, including the production of milligram quantities of multiple catalytically active and inactive
IDE variants, and excellent NMR spectra of dimeric IDE acquired by introducing sparsely labelled methyl groups
in a perdeuterated environment, indicate the high feasibility of successfully completing the proposed studies.
Given the importance of IDE in the pathogenesis of AD, our research also has substantial medical relevance
and will lay the necessary foundation for an R01 proposal, geared toward bridging the gap between biophysical
and clinical studies and developing selective activators and variants of IDE for the treatment of AD."

 This MIRA renewal grant proposal briefly summarizes the accomplishments over the past 4 years of
support and outlines plans for continued support. The theme that unifies this research is the development
and application of new physical methods that can impact the quantitative analysis of complex biological
systems. The freedom to develop and broaden our research provided by the MIRA support has led to a
significant evolution of the emphasis of part of our work on infectious diseases. Specifically, we will focus on
the biomedically critical need to understand the origin(s) of antibiotic resistance using the TEM -lactamases
as an initial target. Likewise, our efforts to develop novel ways to organize and manipulate biological
membranes now focus on the mechanism of viral membrane fusion. While these two areas had completely
separate origins in the parent R01’s that were merged in the MIRA, they have both provided rich areas for
new and impactful research.
 My lab develops spectroscopic methods for probing protein-exerted electric fields which we use to
obtain quantitative information on how electric fields contribute to catalysis at the active sites of enzymes.
We led the development of vibrational Stark effect spectroscopy as a general approach to map these fields.
Using this approach, we can, for the first time, quantify the electrostatic contribution to the catalytic
proficiency of enzymes. Moving beyond ideal model enzymes, we will use this approach to provide a deeper
understanding of the mechanism(s) by which TEM--lactamases evolve to cope with man-made antibiotics.
By studying the connection between evolution and electric fields, we hope to develop general design
principles for these enzymes and discover the physical origins of antibiotic resistance.
 We discovered that “split” GFPs can be photo-dissociated, and we study the underlying mechanism of
this unusual process for optogenetic applications. This deeper view of strand photo-dissociation along with
our work elucidating factors that control bond-specific photo-isomerization pathways are connected to our
work on protein electrostatics and will provide a framework for understanding GFP’s electro-optic properties.
 Our lab pioneered the development of model membrane architectures, along with imaging and analytical
methods that probe fundamental aspects of biological membrane organization and dynamics. Our current
focus is the application of these architectures and novel single particle assays to characterize the
elementary steps by which enveloped viruses, such as influenza A, fuse to target membranes. In parallel,
we characterize the organization of lipids with high lateral resolution using imaging mass spectrometry.
Recently we showed that atom recombination can be used to identify which lipids and proteins are in very
close proximity (< 3nm) in biological membranes. This new approach addresses major challenges in
membrane biophysics and structural biology where local organization is key to emergent function."

Fentanyl contamination of heroin and other drugs is increasingly common, leading to significant rates of
unintentional fentanyl-related overdoses. Fentanyl test strips (FTS) are a low-threshold approach to mitigating
fentanyl-related overdose risk among people who use drugs (PWUD). Using FTS, PWUD can dissolve a small
quantity of a drug into water to test for the presence of fentanyl. PWUD report that FTS are easy to use with
few logistical and environmental barriers associated with use. Moreover, emerging evidence indicates that FTS
use positively impacts subsequent actions. In prior work conducted by our team, PWUD in Philadelphia
reported exceptionally high rates of positive FTS results on non-heroin drugs, far higher than rates seen in
other locations. Possible explanations for these discordant results include saturation of the Philadelphia illicit
drug market with fentanyl, incorrect use of FTS, incorrect interpretation of FTS, or a combination of the three.
Despite increasing distribution of FTS, no studies to date have explored the accuracy of FTS use by PWUD. In
addition, while the prevalence of fentanyl in the heroin supply has been widely documented, it is currently
unknown to what extent fentanyl is present in non-heroin drug markets. Based upon the recent findings in
Philadelphia reporting alarmingly high rates of FTS positivity with non-heroin drugs and these gaps in current
knowledge regarding both FTS use and contamination of the non-heroin drug supply, there is an urgent need
to assess the accuracy of FTS use among PWUD and the extent fentanyl is present in the Philadelphia non-
heroin drug supply. The long-term goal of this work is to advance overdose prevention measures using FTS
and other drug-checking technology in drug markets around the U.S. The overall objective of this proposal is to
leverage established municipal and community partnerships in Philadelphia and the use of advanced drug-
checking technology to explicate gaps identified between previously detected levels of fentanyl in the drug
supply and self-reported results from FTS use among PWUD in Philadelphia. Our objective will be achieved
with two specific aims: (1) Determine user process of use and interpretation of FTS and (2) Estimate the true
presence of fentanyl in the non-heroin drug supply in Philadelphia, PA. This study will have significant impact
by addressing knowledge gaps regarding utility of FTS as a harm reduction strategy and providing actionable
evidence regarding the extent of fentanyl presence in non-heroin drugs. We anticipate three outcomes from
aims: (1) the identification of educational gaps in the proper use of FTS and interpretation of their results
among PWUD, (2) point-in-time data for fentanyl contamination of non-heroin illicit drugs in Philadelphia, and
(3) informing ongoing national campaigns to educate PWUD about FTS and overdose prevention strategies.
Study findings will enhance evidence-based overdose prevention efforts targeted at supply-side fentanyl
contamination and real-world FTS use practices by PWUD."

Sexual violence (SV) and alcohol use are pervasive co-occurring epidemics on U.S. college campuses. About 25%
of college women are sexually assaulted during college, and up to 55% of college students engage in heavy
episodic drinking (HED; 5 or more drinks for men, 4 or more drinks for women). It is well-established that
alcohol use increases the risk of SV but, more recently, findings show that alcohol also inhibits bystander
intervention. However, existing bystander behavior interventions do not incorporate messages or teach skills
encouraging alcohol-involved bystander intervention (e.g., bystander intervention when individuals consume
alcohol or are in alcohol contexts such as bars or parties), nor tested messages among college students who
engage in HED. This study aims to fill these gaps in knowledge by developing theory-driven digital media
messages delivered in a social media intervention that aim to increase alcohol-involved bystander intervention.
Approximately 84% of college-aged adults use social media. Social media has been used to deliver digital media
messages to change behavior and attitudes in various public health areas and is an ideal way to encourage
behavior within an ecological context where health behavior and decisions occur. The specific aims of this
proposal are to 1) develop and produce digital media messages (i.e., pictures, images, text-only content, videos)
focused on alcohol-involved bystander intervention and 2) assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
efficacy of the digital media messages on alcohol-involved bystander intervention and attitudes. We will conduct
focus groups to inform the development of digital media messages (n=36) and assess attention to static messages
using eye-tracking technology (n=30) with college students who engage in HED. The digital media messages will
raise awareness of when and how to intervene in alcohol contexts and/or when bystanders are drinking.
Messages will promote identifying SV risk situations in settings involving alcohol and how to intervene safely
and effectively when intoxicated or drinking (e.g., encouraging bystanders who are drinking to ""scan the room,""
""create a diversion,"" ""use that liquid courage to step in,"" etc.). We will test the developed messages in a pilot study
with 60 college students who engage in HED who will be randomized to the following groups: 1) alcohol-involved
bystander digital media messages or 2) attention-matched placebo digital media messages. Participants will view
and engage with digital media messages in a six-week social media intervention implemented via Instagram.
Feasibility will be assessed via social media metrics (e.g., shares, comments, likes), number of Instagram post
views, and recruitment and retention of the sample. Acceptability of digital media messages will be assessed
through an eye-tracking task and a self-report survey at immediate post-test; preliminary efficacy will be
assessed via self-reported surveys at baseline, immediate post-test, and 3-month follow-up. Findings from this
innovative R21 will make a critical contribution to campus SV prevention by informing a scalable social media
intervention targeting alcohol-involved bystander intervention."

 The removal of toxic or unwanted cellular structures – such as protein aggregates, intracellular pathogens
and damaged organelles – presents a fundamental challenge for eukaryotic cells. To eliminate these structures,
which are too large and too complex for the proteasome, cells require an alternative degradation pathway,
autophagy. The predominant view in the field is that all autophagy targets are degraded by a common
mechanism. However, this understanding comes primarily from studies of only a few model substrates, with the
unsubstantiated assumption that other cargoes behave similarly. To test this model, I developed a panel of
cargo-specific autophagy reporters amenable to genetic screening, quantitative microscopy, and biochemical
manipulation. By this approach, I discovered that autophagy cargo (and their receptors) are instructive for
autophagy, such that different cargoes can induce autophagy via different mechanisms. In the process, I
discovered a new cohort of proteins that facilitate cargo selection and autophagosome initiation. Going forward,
the broad goal of our work is to apply our receptor-centric paradigm to reveal new autophagy mechanisms,
dissect the physiological impact(s) of autophagy, and elucidate heretofore unknown lysosomal trafficking
pathways. We expect our studies to reshape the traditional view of how autophagy factors function into a more
complex web of overlapping mechanisms that ensure robust cytoplasm-to-lysosome delivery. In doing so, we
will reveal conserved principles of autophagy and inform our understanding of autophagy dysregulation in
disease."

Rap1 is a central signaling node connecting agonist stimulation to talin recruitment to integrins, a 
final common step in integrin activation. In leukocytes, RIAM is a Rap1 effector that mediates 
talin-dependent activation; however, in platelets the identity of such Rap1 effectors is obscure 
and is a key gap in our understanding. Preliminary data suggest a new evolutionarily-conserved 
paradigm that talin contains two Rap1 binding sites that enable it to serve as a Rap1 effector. The 
applicant hypothesizes that talin itself is the principal, and perhaps only, Rap1 effector implicated 
in platelet integrin activation. Secondly, he suggests that that the talin-Rap1 interaction may 
contribute to integrin function even in leukocytes that contain an abundant Rap1 effector, RIAM 
and in endothelial cells that contain substantial lamellipodin, a RIAM paralogue. To examine 
these ideas: Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that a direct Rap1-talin interaction plays 
a central role in platelet integrin activation. Mice in which the megakaryocytes and platelets 
express talin with either or both Rap1 binding sites disabled will be analyzed for platelet structure, 
function, and formation. Hemostasis and thrombosis will be tested in a variety of assays. A 
biomembrane force probe will characterize the role of the Rap1-talin interaction in individual 
IIb3 integrin-ligand bonds. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that direct Rap1-Talin 
interaction is important in RIAM-replete cells. In collaboration with Project 2 Integrin 
activation, conformation, and topology in leukocytes will be analyzed in cells bearing each of the 
three talin alleles described in Aim1. The effect of each mutation in combination with RIAM 
deletion or with RIAM over-expression will test the relative roles of these two Rap1 effectors. 
Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the talin-Rap1 interaction is important in 
endothelial cells. Mice expressing one of the three mutant talin alleles selectively in 
endothelium will be studied for hemorrhage and developmental phenotypes. Effects on integrin 
activation, spreading, and cell-cell junctions will be assessed in vitro in primary lung and brain 
microvascular endothelial cells. Lamellipodin deletion and over expression will enable an analysis 
of the relationship of lamellipodin and Rap1 binding to talin in endothelial cell functions. Together, 
achievement of these aims will test the paradigm-shifting hypothesis that talin itself serves as 
the major Rap1 effector in platelet function in hemostasis and thrombosis and evaluate the 
importance of the Rap1-talin interaction in leukocytes and endothelial cells."

This is project 2 of the PPG “Cellular Mechanisms of Inflammation, Hemostasis, and Thrombosis”. Kindlin-3 is 
known to be required for integrin activation in platelets and leukocytes. This is starkly illustrated by the human 
disease Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency-III. Patients with this disease have mutations in FERMT3, the gene 
encoding kindlin-3, and suffer from life-threatening bleeding and bacterial infections. Infections result because 
kindlin-3-deficient leukocytes including neutrophils cannot adhere to the vessel wall and thus fail to recruit to 
sites of infection. Neutrophils express two β2 integrins, αLβ2 and αMβ2. We made and validated a humanized 
mouse in which human β2 was knocked into the mouse β2 locus. In this mouse, β2 integrin activation can be 
monitored by binding of mAbs 24 and KIM127, specific for activation epitopes in human β2. We propose to use 
flow cytometry, live cell imaging by quantitative dynamic footprinting, superresolution microscopy by 
SuperSTORM, recently developed in the Ley lab, and intravital microscopy in the β2 integrin humanized 
mouse to address three specific aims: Specific Aim 1 is to test the role of the kindlin-3 PH domain in β2 
integrin activation. We hypothesize that the PH domain is required for kindlin-3 recruitment to the plasma 
membrane. We use retrovirally transduced neutrophilic cells expressing fluorescent fusion proteins of kindlin-3. 
For in vivo assessment, we transduce kindlin-3-deficient hematopoitic stem cells with vectors encoding kindlin- 
3 fusion proteins to achieve expression in primary mouse neutrophils in vivo. Specific Aim 2 is to test the 
importance of kindlin-3 dimerization. Dimerization will be assessed by Förster Resonance Energy Transfer 
(FRET), both in total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy (near the membrane) and by confocal microscopy (in 
the cytosol). We hypothesize that the PH domain also may contribute to dimerization, similar to the 
dimerization of sharpin, which is studied in project 4. Specific Aim 3 is to test how kindlin-3 interacts with 
talin-1 and β2 integrins. To test this, we make use of the existing mCherry FP-talin-1 transgenic mouse, since 
talin-1 is too large for retroviral packaging. F(ab) made from the β2 integrin activation reporters KIM127 and 
mAb24 will be used to assess β2 integrin conformations in vitro and, using the human β2 integrin knockin 
mouse, in primary neutrophils in vivo. Project 2 will closely collaborate with project 1 by conducting live cell 
and superresolution imaging to address the role of Rap-1 binding for talin-1 function. Project 1 investigators 
will assist project 2 with various biochemical assays. When the proposed work is completed, we will 
understand how kindlin-3 and talin-1 cooperate to enable β2 integrin-dependent neutrophil arrest under flow."
10902044,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Integrin αIIbβ3 (GP IIb-IIIa) is the platelet receptor for fibrinogen and is required for platelet aggregation during 
hemostasis. Fibrinogen binding to platelets is regulated by interactions of specific intracellular proteins, including 
talin and kindlin-3, with the β3 cytoplasmic tail. In contrast, proteins that might interact with the αIIb tail to regulate 
fibrinogen binding are relatively unexplored. We have found that human and mouse platelets and endothelial 
cells express the 40 kDa protein, SHARPIN. Studies with human platelets as well as with platelets and 
megakaryocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells have revealed that SHARPIN can interact 
directly with either the αIIb tail or with two other proteins to constitute the linear ubiquitination chain assembly 
complex (LUBAC). In fact, stimulation of platelets by traditional hemostatic agonists, such as thrombin, or by 
inflammatory agonists, such as lipopolysaccharide or soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), triggers both fibrinogen 
binding to αIIbβ3 and Met1-linked linear ubiquitination of IKKγ (NEMO) to promote NF-kB pathway signaling. 
SHARPIN knockdown by shRNA in megakaryocytes and platelets results in decreased agonist-induced, linear 
ubiquitination of NEMO, but increased fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3, MHC Class I expression, and release of 
endogenous sCD40L. Here we will test the hypothesis that SHARPIN’s mutually exclusive interactions with 
integrin α tails or LUBAC regulate critical platelet and/or endothelial cell responses during hemostasis, 
thrombosis, inflammation and angiogenesis. Aim 1 will use advanced techniques, including optogenetics, to 
determine the stoichiometry of SHARPIN and αIIbβ3 in platelets and to test the functional effects of enforcing 
SHARPIN interactions with either αIIb or LUBAC. Platelet-specific SHARPIN knockout mice will be generated in 
order to test the requirement for platelet SHARPIN in hemostasis, thrombosis and inflammation using a range of 
mouse models. Aim 2 will determine the role of SHARPIN in the adhesive and angiogenic functions of integrin 
αVβ3 and in NF-kB pathway signaling in endothelial cells. Endothelial cell SHARPIN will be specifically and 
conditionally knocked out in mice, and lung microvascular endothelial cells from these mice will be evaluated for 
αVβ3-dependent adhesive responses and for angiogenic sprouting. The effects of deleting endothelial cell 
SHARPIN in vivo will be determined using established mouse models of developmental and pathological 
angiogenesis. This project will make heavy use of the Hemostasis, Thrombosis, and Inflammation Models Core 
and it will collaborate with all other projects in this Program to achieve its aims. Altogether, these studies will 
provide a comprehensive test of the central hypothesis and establish new mechanistic insights into the regulation 
of integrin and immune signaling by SHARPIN in vascular cells, with clear implications for hemostasis, 
thrombosis, inflammation and angiogenesis."
10904817,"Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions remain a cornerstone treatment in the management of sickle cell disease
(SCD). However, patients may experience delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) which in this patient
population has an unpredictable progression from mild to life-threatening severe reactions where both transfused
and patient’s own RBCs are destroyed along with reticulocytopenia at the time of hemolytic crisis, exacerbating
the anemia. The mechanisms underlying severe DHTR progression are poorly understood, posing challenges
for prevention and effective treatments for this transfusion complication which disproportionately is encountered
in patients with SCD. We recently found that acute hemolysis induces type I interferon (IFN-I) production in innate
immune cells, leading to increased differentiation and activation of monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMΦ) in
SCD, and exacerbating destruction of antibody (Ab)-coated transfused RBCs. Our preliminary data showed that
Ab-sensitized RBC destruction alone also led to IFN-I production. Interestingly, only when the incompatible RBC
destruction occurs under hemolytic conditions inducing highest levels of IFN-I, we detect bystander hemolysis
of sickle RBCs, mimicking hyperhemolysis reaction in SCD. We also found that hemolysis-induced IFN-I impairs
erythropoiesis along with inhibition of EPO/EPOR signaling. Based on these data, we hypothesize that Fc
receptor crosslinking in a hemolytic backdrop of SCD leads to increase in IFN-I levels, causing heightened IFN-
I signaling in phagocytes and erythroid cells which trigger increased RBC destruction and inhibits RBC
production, respectively, in severe DHTR. In aim 1, we will focus on identifying mechanisms of bystander
hemolysis by examining the role of key phagocytosis activation molecules, including thrombospondin (TSP-1)
and its ligands which are upregulated in our hyperhemolytic models. We will compare the role of Ab-mediated
erythrophagocytosis versus Ab-independent RBC engulfment in triggering bystander hemolysis and interrogate
the relative contribution of murine/human FcγR/SYK pathway and heme activation pathways in bystander
hemolysis. We will also examine the potential of IFN-I as a biomarker of DHTR severity by examining IFN-
I/STAT1 driven changes in monocyte phagocytosis associated profiles in SCD patient samples, comparing
patients experiencing severe and mild DHTR and after recovery to steady state. For aim 2, we will define the
mechanisms by which IFN-I suppresses erythropoiesis using primary erythroid cell culture system and targeted
deletion of key downstream pathways in human erythroblast cell lines and mouse models. We will also test the
therapeutic effects of inhibiting IFN-I production/IFN-I signaling or/and increasing EPO/EPOR signaling on
reversing impaired BM erythropoiesis in SCD mice and on human erythropoiesis in vitro and in cultures treated
from SCD patient plasma. We believe that our proposed studies to examine the basis for progression to DHTR
severity may help stratify risk and aid in development of novel targeted therapies to reverse or prevent
hyperhemolysis, a devastating complication of an otherwise life-saving treatment in SCD."

Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness with strong heritability, and advances in genetics have started to
unravel the complex molecular underpinnings of this disorder. GWAS have identified over 250 loci linked to
schizophrenia which are enriched near genes expressed in CNS neurons and involved in synaptic biology.
Most schizophrenia-associated variants are in the non-coding region of the genome, though a small number
result in a mutation within a known protein. The most significantly associated coding variant in schizophrenia
GWAS is rs13107325 in SLC39A8, resulting in a missense mutation (A391T) in the eponymous manganese
(Mn2+) transporter. Mn2+ transport by SLC39A8 is critical for glycosylation, the enzymatic attachment of
carbohydrates to proteins and lipids, which is involved in neurodevelopment and synaptic function.
Here, the applicant will investigate a novel molecular mechanism underlying increased schizophrenia risk in
A391T carriers using a mouse model of genetic risk. Having shown that A391T mice have altered glycosylation
of synaptic proteins, including neurotransmitter receptors and cell adhesion molecules, the applicant will test if
altered glycosylation of these proteins changes their trafficking and localization, deposition of complement, and
the number of dendritic spines in the frontal cortex (Aim 1). Next, he will attempt to reverse previously identified
glycome changes with oral Mn2+ supplementation, overcoming impaired SLC39A8 transport from A391T.
These studies will employ existing genetically engineered mouse lines, glycobiology techniques pioneered by
the applicant, and cutting-edge neuroscience training in analysis of the synapse. Together, these aims will
define the molecular alterations caused by A391T at the synapse and provide critical preclinical data for Mn2+
supplementation in carriers of A391T during critical periods of brain development and maturation.
The applicant, Dr. Robert Mealer, is well qualified to execute the proposed experiments with his background in
neuroscience, psychiatric genetics, and glycobiology. The four-year training plan will foster development
towards independent investigator status and generate the preliminary data necessary for a future R01
application with clear therapeutic potential. He will continue his mentee relationships with Drs. Smoller and
Cummings, while receiving additional training and mentorship from Dr. Morgan Sheng on the molecular
analysis of the synapse. He has also enlisted Dr. Michael Aschner, a world leader on Mn2+ in the brain, and Dr.
Maurizio Fava, a clinician researcher with extensive experience in psychopharmacology and trial design, as
members of his research advisory committee. Finally, the collaborative research environment is ideal for
furthering the applicant’s goal of becoming an independent researcher in academic psychiatry."

Peripheral nerve injuries, as a result of trauma, tumors, or other medical conditions, require 50,000-200,000
surgeries annually, and may cause complete or partial paralysis. The autograft is the current ""gold standard""
but requires additional procedures to harvest the graft, can be challenging to perform in a pediatric population,
and often leads to neuroma formation and loss of function at the donor site. The goal of this project is to validate
the materials and methods to fabricate pre-clinical polymeric three-dimensional (3D) nerve conduits with an
embedded wireless sensor for continuous monitoring of functional recovery to be used in infants/children. The
3D printed vascularizable nerve conduits mimic the micro-architecture of nerve tissues, are embedded with
wireless sensors for in situ monitoring, and can perform biomimetic functions to augment nerve regeneration
therapies. Currently, there is no clinical solution for monitoring the success of a neural graft therapy after
surgery. Specific Aim 1 will focus on optimizing 3D-bioprinted nerve conduit fabrication and performance using
commercial-grade biomaterials for clinical translation. To fabricate such a conduit in this aim, we will use a
Rapid Projection, Image-guided, Direct-printing (RaPID) platform that can 3D-print the entire nerve conduit in
mere seconds and will match the patient’s specific size and shape. The conduit will have linear micro-channels
along the length for axon growth and side micro-holes for vascularization. Specific Aim 2 will validate generation
of pediatric patient-specific conduits based on volumetric defect. In this aim, we will coordinate the collection of
MRI data among pediatric patients from birth to 18 years of age, both sexes, and with peripheral nerve injuries
involving the head and neck, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Based upon the MRI data collected, personalized
pediatric nerve conduits will be 3D bioprinted to validate the RaPID system and provide evidence for planned
FDA regulatory review. Specific Aim 3 will develop a wirelessly powered and controlled sensor to detect
electrical impulses across a nerve defect. In this aim, we will attach wireless sensors via a polymeric cuff design
to the distal end of an injured mouse sciatic nerve to assess the rate and robustness of nerve fiber growth
across the therapeutic repair site. Developing this implantable sensor will pave the way for integrating
diagnostics with therapeutics for surgical interventions. The final deliverable at the completion of this proposal
will be to have the manufacturing specifications, source material specifications, sizing limits, testing and release
specifications for 3D bioprinted nerve conduits with wireless sensing to support a pre-submission meeting with

Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a characteristic clinical phenotype that
includes motor impairment resembling cerebral palsy, intellectual disability (mental retardation), difficult
behaviors (severe self-injury and impulsivity), and overproduction of uric acid (leading to kidney stones and gout).
LND is caused by pathological genetic variants in the HPRT1 gene, which encodes the purine salvage enzyme
hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGprt). Over the past 20 years, great progress has been
made in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease using cell models, animal models, and studies of human
patients. These studies have indicated that the neurobehavioral abnormalities result in large part from
dysfunction of midbrain dopamine neurons. These neurons do not die or show degenerative changes; they
develop abnormally. The many preclinical advances have not been translated into clinical trials for LND for one
major reason. This reason is that there is insufficient information regarding the developmental age at which
interventions, such as restoration of HGprt, must be made. It is possible that intervention at any age could have
a therapeutic effect by reversing functional metabolic defects responsible for arrested development or neuronal
dysfunction. Alternatively, if HGprt deficiency causes irreversible defects during early development, then the
intervention may have to occur at an early age to have any therapeutic value. The current proposal addresses
this crucial question regarding the developmental window for intervention and rescue. We plan a three-tiered
approach involving a novel cell model based on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), a novel Hprt1 conditional
knockout mouse, and a unique bank of human LND brains collected at autopsy. The results will provide answers
that address a major roadblock in translational efforts to rescue the phenotype of LND."

With the improvement in perinatal and neonatal care, a new generation of preterm survivors are now reaching
adulthood who have increased incidence of cardiovascular morbidities. This a public health concern. Most
preterm infants are exposed to supraphysiological oxygen levels. Neonatal hyperoxia exposure in preterm infants
increases vascular stiffness in childhood, leading to hypertension, stroke and ischemic heart disease in adult
life. However, little is understood about the molecular mechanisms linking neonatal hyperoxia exposure and
systemic vascular stiffness. Currently, there are no strategies to prevent the long-term systemic vascular
complications seen in preterm infants. This proposal will provide insights into the underlying mechanisms that
drive neonatal hyperoxia-induced systemic vascular stiffness and will identify novel targets to reduce vascular
diseases in preterm survivors across their lifespan.
In this project, Dr. Benny proposes to determine the molecular mechanisms by which endothelial Chemokine
Receptor 7 (CXCR7) decreases neonatal hyperoxia-induced systemic vascular stiffness. Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that endothelial CXCR7 decreases neonatal hyperoxia-induced systemic vascular stiffness by
suppressing Transforming Growth Factor-β signaling in smooth muscle cells. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that
endothelial CXCR7 attenuates neonatal hyperoxia-induced smooth muscle cell fibrosis by downregulating
endothelial inflammasome signaling.
Dr. Benny is firmly committed to a career focused on investigating the early origins of vascular morbidities in
preterm survivors. Her long-term goal is to translate her experimental laboratory research into the development
of therapeutic strategies that could ameliorate the vascular morbidities in the preterm survivors. If these goals
are achieved, her work will have a lasting impact on the cardiovascular outcomes of the preterm survivors across
their lifespan. She is strongly supported in her career and research goals by her mentors and her division at the
University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. She currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of
Pediatrics with 75% protected time for research, start-up funds for her laboratory, independent laboratory and
office space.
This K08 award will allow Dr. Benny to undertake formal scientific training in vascular injury and stiffness. Under
the guidance of her primary mentor, Dr. Omaida Velazquez, her co-mentor Dr. Roberto Vazquez-Padron and
her mentoring committee which includes Dr. Joshua Hare, Dr. Karen Young, Dr. Claudia Rodrigues and Dr. Shu
Wu, she is fully equipped to advance her skills in both in vivo and in vitro methodologies described for assessing
vascular injury and stiffness. In addition, she will achieve her training goals through a career development plan
that consists of intensive mentorship, participation in institutional scientific and career development seminars,
attendance and presentation at national meetings. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide
Dr. Benny with the skills and experience necessary to successfully compete for independent funding in the next
phase of her career."

Although people living with HIV (PLWHIV) have comparable life-expectancy as the HIV-negative population
does, their life-quality is still deeply compromised due to the prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders including
depression and anxiety. The main pathological changes in the brains of those people include aberrant microglial
(Mg) activation and neuronal injuries. Drug abuse is a high comorbidity of HIV infection and abused drugs could
exaggerate the existing neurologic complications in PLWHIV. The detailed mechanisms underlying such
phenomenon remain much elusive. Several contributing factors have been suggested for such neurological
disorders including the continued expression HIV proteins such as trans-activator of transcription (TAT), the
long-term use of antiretrovirals (ARVs), and drugs of abuse. Our preliminary data demonstrated that :1) NLRP3
inflammasome signaling was involved in HIV-TAT-mediated Mg activation; 2) cocaine activated Mg through
dysregulating miR-124/TLR4 axis, which could be reversed by inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome; 3)
combination ARVs used in clinical practice (tenofovir:TFV, emtricitabine:FTC, and dolutegravir:DTG) could
activate Mg via lysosomal dysfunction; 4) co-exposure of Mg to three agents (TAT, cocaine, and ARVs)
intriguingly resulted in increased activity of NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro; 5) IL1β, the final executor of NLRP3
inflammasome activation, decreased the spine density and increase the glutamate receptor ionotropic NMDA
subunits (Grins) in vitro; and 6) increased NLRP3 inflammasome activity was shown in the brains of SIV-infected
macaque. Based on these findings and two distinct steps of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, we hypothesize
that exacerbated NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the context of HIV-TAT/HIV, cocaine, ARVs will lead to
exaggerated Mg activation and neuronal injuries, which are responsible for the high incidence of neuropsychiatric
disorders in PLWHIV with cocaine use. We will test this hypothesis in the following two specific aims (SA) using
complimentary in vitro and in vivo approaches. SA1: Investigate the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in Mg
activation and neuronal injuries in the context of HIV-TAT/HIV, cocaine, & ARVs. We will split this SA into three
sub aims. SA1A will explore the detailed mechanisms responsible for exaggerated NLRP3 inflammasome
activation in vitro; SA1B will explore the mechanisms underlying NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuronal
injuries; and SA1C will investigate the status of NLRP3 inflammasome and neuronal injuries in archived SIV-
infected macaque brains and HIV-infected individuas with or without cocaine use. SA2: Explore the potential
therapeutic effects of NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition on neuropsychiatric behaviors in HIV iTat mice in vivo."

Proper transmission of visual information relies on photoreceptors forming appropriate synaptic connections
during development. Nearly all retinal diseases that lead to blindness are caused by loss of photoreceptors
connections. Thus, elucidating the molecular mechanisms that mediate proper photoreceptor connectivity may
lead to better therapies to treat patients with retinal diseases. During development, photoreceptors first synapse
selectively to horizontal cells, where the dendrites of horizontal cells synapse to cone photoreceptors and the
axon connects to rod photoreceptors. Cones and rods then synapse to their respective bipolar target. Cones
synapse to cone bipolars and rods to rod bipolars. The molecular mechanisms that guide selective wiring of the
different photoreceptors to their distinct synaptic partners remains poorly understood. Our data shows the L1 cell
adhesion molecule Neurofascin (Nfasc) is localized to the synaptic layer during development and expressed in
rods, horizontal cells, and rod bipolars. Moreover, we find disruption of Nfasc results in rod synaptic defects and
abnormal rod-driven visual responses. As Nfasc is known to mediate adhesive interactions between neurons,
we propose Nfasc is a key molecule mediating selective connectivity of rods to horizontal cells and then to rod
bipolars. In addition, we find other cell adhesion molecules that are known to work alongside Nfasc (i.e. Caspr,
Cntn1, Nrcam), to be expressed in the complementary cone pathway. Thereby, we hypothesize that restricted
expression of cell adhesion molecules mediates selective wiring of the different photoreceptors to their respective
targets. To test our hypothesis, we will mouse transgenics, in vivo genetic manipulations, and single neuron
labeling approaches to identify the key molecular interactions that guide photoreceptors to synapse selectively
to different partners. The proposed research will elucidate the adhesive molecular interactions that instruct
selective wiring of photoreceptors to horizontal cells (Aim 1) and to bipolar neurons (Aim 2). Through these
experiments, we will uncover the molecular mechanisms involved in complex wiring of neural circuits during
development. This knowledge will be necessary to develop new strategies to restore vision in those with retinal
diseases."

The long-term goal of this study is to identify functional genetic variants that are associated with
SUDs, and thereby contribute to understanding the mechanisms underlying these devastating
disorders. Our overall objectives are to (i) design and implement a series of experimental methods
to assess the impact of genetic variants relevant to SUDs and related traits and computational
models to predict the impact of additional variants, and (ii) establish a statistical genetics
framework to more effectively identify additional genes that contribute to the disorders. This
proposal builds upon our previous studies on the role of genomic variation in gene regulation and
will generate new data to combine with existing multi-omics data and modeling. We propose the
following Specific Aims: 1. Identify functional genetic variants that contribute to the risk for
substance use disorders and related phenotypes by affecting gene regulation, using a
series of high-throughput reporter assays to evaluate the impact of tens of thousands of non-
coding variations in enhancers, promoters and 3’UTRs on gene expression in eight cell lines
representing four major cell types in brain (neurons, microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes).
Variants with a modest association with substance use disorders and related traits will be selected
from the GWAS catalog and experiments underway. Data on the initial large sets of variants will
be used to predict, using machine learning approaches, the functional impact of additional
regulatory variants. A large subset of the variants predicted to be functional will then be tested
with follow-up HTRAs, and the predictive models refined based upon the data. 2. Identify genes
whose expression changes contribute to the risk for SUDs. We will use Mendelian
Randomization-based methods based on the data derived from Aim 1 plus GWAS data from the
PGC and other large consortia to identify causal genes whose expression changes in specific cell
types contribute to SUD-related phenotypes. Upon completion of these studies, we will have
created a unique, accessible resource of SUD-associated genetic variants that regulate target
gene expression in specific brain cell types. These genes can serve as high priority candidates
for future functional and animal-based studies."

Using single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) we can study proteins and protein complexes to
atomic resolution and elucidate dynamics and distinct functional states in native or near-native environments.
But this is virtually impossible to do with small proteins. My lab is interested in understanding protein function by
observing their structures at high-resolution in native states. We leverage expertise in cryoEM and computational
protein design to study proteins, both soluble and membrane, and their complexes that play major roles in human
diseases. Membrane proteins are cellular gatekeepers and one of the most important class of membrane
proteins are the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which act as signal conduits through ligand-induced
binding on outside cells to the recruitment of binding complexes inside cells to relay signals. As they are involved
in most cellular processes they are of considerable interest in drug development.
 While cryoEM has gained momentum in structural biology, it has a fundamental limitation that proteins
smaller than 40 kDa cannot be studied effectively because the signal in the images is too low. This means that
most proteins in the human genome cannot be studied by cryoEM. Using a designed approach, I was recently
able to solve the high-resolution structure of a 17kDa protein by cryoEM, almost 3 times smaller than current
cryoEM size limits. I succeeded because we used computational design to attach the 17 kDa protein to a scaffold
which helped imaging by increasing the mass of the particle and the higher symmetry afforded better
reconstruction. This proof-of-principal experiment demonstrates the powerful combination of using computational
design for cryoEM. While exciting, this scaffold approach is still at its infancy and further design and development
are needed to realize its full potential. New scaffolds capable of displaying important membrane proteins like
GPCRs will be developed, tested and optimized. These new nanomaterials will be specifically tailored to address
cryoEM needs. With this approach we will investigate membrane protein structure, describe functional dynamics
in near native environments and facilitate rapid structure-guided drug design to help against devastating
diseases."

The discovery and characterization of an efficient, ultraprocessive reverse transcriptase
(MarathonRT) now makes it possible to develop high-throughput methods for accurate end-to-
end sequencing of long RNA transcripts, thereby preserving information content on alternative
splicing, editing and modification isoforms while conserving positional linkage information,
thereby enabling one to distinguish RNA isoforms in complex mixtures without mapping to a
reference genome. This type of technology is essential for deciphering the role of post-
transcriptional RNA processing events during control of developmental stage, cell and tissue
specificity and regulation of gene expression in higher organisms. It must be sufficiently
efficient and accurate to power the long-read sequencing approaches that are used in single-
cell RNAseq, particularly when transcript diversification is monitored as a function of time. The
first two aims of the proposal are focused on high-throughput detection of RNA modifications
(such as 2-O-methyl groups and N7-methyl guanosines). In the first aim, a unique MarathonRT
primer extension protocol will be combined with a trained mutational profiling algorithm to
recognize the positions and chemical identities of specific RNA modifications, reporting a
modification signature that can be recognized at high throughput during long-read sequencing
(MRT-ModSeq). In the second aim, MRT-ModSeq will be tested on unknown RNAs, where it
will be used to predict sites of modifications on challenging long transcripts and robustness of
the predictions will be directly evaluated using mass spectrometry. The second half of the
proposal is focused on identification of linked alternative splicing and editing sites on long
transcripts within complex cellular mixtures. In aim 3, MarathonRT will be incorporated into a
workflow for accurately profiling the relative abundance and processing diversity of the highly
complex paralytic (para) gene, which encodes more than 1 million possible processing variants,
a subset of which are essential for the voltage-gating of a sodium channel. This sets the stage
for Aim 4, in which sensitivity of the workflow must be further optimized and merged with data
analysis strategies suitable for time-resolved single cell applications. The resulting method will
be tested by monitoring full-length transcriptomic signatures induced by cell stress."

Most studies investigate whole cancer cell populations and rarely address how single cells or sub-populations
cooperate to promote their survival and spread. This is especially true in the context of metabolism, where tumors
harbor distinct sub-populations of glycolytic and oxidative cells forged in part by microenvironmental pressures.
How this metabolic heterogeneity drives tumor invasion and metastasis is an unexplored area and requires
approaches that can isolate these specific cancer cell sub-populations. This multi-PI application in lung
adenocarcinoma attempts to address this by determining how metabolically heterogeneous cancer cell sub-
populations function and cooperate to drive invasion and metastasis. We build upon our published image-guided
genomics technology (SaGA) to extract living and phenotypically defined cell sub-populations within collectively
invading packs. We used SaGA to deconstruct the lung cancer collective invasion pack, which is comprised of
hierarchical groups of invasive leader and proliferative follower cells invading as a cohesive unit. Our published
and preliminary data show that follower cells consume twice as much glucose as leaders, and rely on glycolysis
and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to maintain their proliferative state. By simply disrupting
the glucose transporter, GLUT1, followers become invasive and take on a leader-like phenotype. In contrast,
leaders rely on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity to drive
invasion, where disrupting PDH creates a more follower-like phenotype. These data lead to our overarching
hypothesis that metabolic heterogeneity sustained by differential GLUT1 and PDH-driven metabolism facilitates
lung cancer metastasis by maintaining distinct phenotypes in the collective invasion pack. We propose that this
metabolic heterogeneity warrants a co-targeting therapeutic approach that disrupts both metabolic populations
to inhibit metastasis. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to 1) elucidate the molecular basis and mechanistic
underpinnings of how metabolic heterogeneity drives collective invasion and 2) test if co-targeting different
metabolic sub-populations limits metastasis. We propose that these studies will directly impact our understanding
of how metabolic heterogeneity sustains cooperativity to promote collective invasion/metastasis."

Population aging is leading to a public health crisis in the growing number of people affected by Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) and Related Dementias (ADRD). It has been more than 15 years since the last FDA approval for
a new treatment for ADRD. To continue the dramatic progress over the last decade in understanding ADRD
pathophysiology we will require significant preclinical and clinical translational research to bring candidate
therapies to clinical use and grow a therapeutic armamentarium sufficient to curb the public health impact of
ADRD. Essential to this success will be a new generation of ADRD scientists, especially scientists with the
unique training and skills necessary to design and perform translational research. This training is rarely provided
through the traditional course of medical, clinical psychology, basic science, or biostatistical education. As a
result, there is a dearth of well-trained ADRD translational investigators. Moreover, there is inadequate diversity
among the current group of active ADRD translational investigators, limiting the unique perspectives and team
science synergies that could propel the field toward critical solutions.
We propose here a new training program in translational ADRD research titled “Training in Translational ADRD
Neuroscience (TITAN)” at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). This new training program will be broadly
inclusive of promising graduate students and junior translational scientists, such as medical doctors, clinical
psychologists, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, bioethicists, and neuroscientists. We have assembled an
outstanding and similarly diverse team of preceptors who will ensure the success of this new training program.
The program will develop novel training opportunities in ADRD translational research while also leveraging the
considerable scientific and training resources at UCI, including the NIA P30-funded Alzheimer’s Disease
Research Center (ADRC), which since April 2020 includes a Research Education Component with
complementary objectives. Similarly, the UCI Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) is UCI’s
NCATS-funded CTSA program that offers synergistic training options to be leveraged, such as the K-club,
responsible conduct of research workshops, and KL2 funding mechanisms. We will recruit diverse trainees from
multidisciplinary specialties as well as individuals from nationally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups,
individuals with disabilities, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, and women."

We propose to develop a fast, quantitative chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging technique, by
integrating CEST with MR fingerprinting (MRF) and deep-learning techniques in a unified framework, with the
ultimate goal of translation into routine clinical practice. CEST imaging is an important molecular MRI method
that can generate contrast based on the proton exchange between solute labile protons and bulk water protons
in tissue. Amide proton transfer (APT) imaging, a variant of CEST-based molecular MRI, is based on the amide
protons (-NH) of endogenous mobile proteins and peptides in tissue. APT-MRI has been used successfully to
image protein content and pH, enabling tumor grading and the differentiation of active recurrent tumor from
treatment effects. However, most currently used APT imaging protocols depend on the acquisition of qualitative,
so-called APT-weighted (APTw) images, limiting the detection sensitivity to quantitative parameters, such as pH
or protein concentration. Currently, quantitative APT imaging is often attempted by assessing a so-called
Z-spectrum, generated by measuring the normalized water signal intensity as a function of saturation frequency
offset under varied radiofrequency (RF) saturation powers, which is time-consuming. Thus, the development of
fast, quantitative APT imaging techniques is needed. MRF is a novel quantitative imaging method that
simultaneously quantifies multiple tissue properties using pseudorandom acquisition parameters, and thus,
significantly improves scan efficiency compared to conventional techniques. MRF has been successfully applied
in patient studies to evaluate the range of and changes in MR relaxation times, T1 and T2, providing initial
evidence of its clinical utility. Recent advances in deep neural networks open a new possibility to efficiently solve
general inversion problems in MRF reconstruction, and to produce high-quality estimates of tissue parameters at
high speed. Our hypothesis is that, by combining APT, MRF, and deep-learning techniques, we can highly
accelerate image acquisition and accurately estimate the quantitative values of the tissue. Our hypotheses will
be tested through three specific aims: 1) to develop a fast 3D APT-MRF sequence and design an optimal RF
saturation schedule using deep-learning; 2) to quantify absolute amide proton concentrations and exchange
rates using convolutional neural networks; and 3) to demonstrate the initial clinical utility of the technology in
brain cancer, which will be confirmed by radiographically-guided stereotactic biopsy. Through quantitative APT
imaging technology, a priori knowledge of the pH and protein content in gliomas may help in the stratification of
patients into personalized therapeutic strategies and help monitor treatment response."
10861769,"Project Summary
This project will address the question of how abnormal synaptic development emerges in neurodevelopmental
disorders. Our overall hypothesis is that disorganized synaptic adhesion and delayed functional assembly of
synaptic vesicles (SVs) impair the formation and physiological maturation of presynaptic terminals, which triggers
subsequent developmental deficits in synaptic connectivity and function. We will test this hypothesis in Fragile X
syndrome (FXS), a leading inheritable form of autism and intellectual disability caused by functional loss of
Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Experimental observations will utilize the evolutionally conserved
endbulb terminals that are readily accessible for in vivo cell-autonomous characterizations in chicken embryos.
We will pursue two specific aims to test several important hypotheses derived from our preliminary studies.
 · In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the role of FMRP-regulated synaptic adhesion in presynaptic
 terminal formation. We hypothesize that axonal FMRP promotes terminal formation, stabilization, and
 selective retraction through developmentally profiled synaptic adhesion. To test this hypothesis, we will
 use cell-group specific and temporally-controlled genetic manipulations combined with in vivo live
 imaging to identify the exact actions of FMRP-mediated axon transport vs. protein translation in dynamic
 terminal turnover. We will also identify FMRP-regulated synaptic adhesion elements in developing
 terminals and assess the effects of correcting these elements on FMRP loss-induced presynaptic and
 axon alterations.
· In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the role of FMRP-regulated synaptotagmin (Syt) in functional
 maturation of presynaptic terminals. Syt1/2 are primary calcium sensors on SVs that trigger vesicle fusion
 and neurotransmitter release. We hypothesize that FMRP regulates presynaptic functional maturation by
 controlling the timely upregulation of Syt2 in nascent terminals. To test this hypothesis, we will determine
 the effects of expressing Syt2 on FMRP loss-induced deficits in SV activity, presynaptic protein
 machinery, and glutamate release. We will also determine the interplay between synaptic adhesion
 regulation and SV assembly under FMRP control using rescue studies.
Together, these results will identify an origin of defective synaptic phenotypes, a hallmark of neurodevelopmental
disorders. This knowledge is of vital importance because it will help establish a sensitive time window and identify
novel therapeutic candidates for preventing, or at least reducing, the progress of synaptic deficits in FXS and
other neurodevelopmental disorders."

Retinal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is a common cause of visual impairment worldwide, affecting both
patients' quality of life and functional status. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival is critical for vision. However,
these retinal neurons are exquisitely sensitive and many of them undergo necrosis and apoptosis after IR.
Since RGC apoptosis is executed by programmed mechanisms and can be regulated, significant attention has
been given to this type of cell death. At the same time, RGC necrosis did not receive nearly enough
consideration, because it was viewed as an accidental and unregulated cellular event. We now know that
necrosis, like apoptosis, can be executed by programmed mechanisms. This form of necrotic cell death is
called necroptosis. Our published data and literature indicate that RGC necroptosis contributes to IR-induced
retinal injury through direct loss of RGCs and induction of associated inflammatory responses. Therefore, since
RGC necroptosis is executed by programmed mechanisms and can be regulated, this field of research is of
great importance. However, the signaling cascades, which regulate IR-induced RGC necroptosis, still remain
unknown. The long-term objective of this project is to identify the signaling cascades that regulate RGC
necroptosis after IR. Based on our published data, preliminary studies and published literature, we proposed a
molecular mechanism of IR-induced RGC necroptosis. We suggested that IR-induced Tnf signaling in RGCs
facilitates formation of a positive-feedback loop for the sustained production of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
which promotes poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (Parp1) over-activation due to significant oxidative DNA
damage. Significant Parp1 over-activation in RGCs mediates ATP depletion, leading to subsequent energy
failure, which results in cellular dysfunction and eventually in loss of RGC membrane integrity (necrosis). We
will employ a wide range of biochemical, molecular and cell biological techniques as well as animal models to
verify the proposed molecular mechanism of IR-induced RGC necroptosis in hypothesis-driven mechanistic
experiments outlined in the following specific aims: 1) to test the hypothesis that Tnf signaling promotes IR-
induced RGC necroptosis; 2) to test the hypothesis that IR-induced RGC necroptosis is promoted by formation
of a positive-feedback loop for sustained ROS production in a Tnf signaling-dependent manner; 3) to test the
hypothesis that RGC necroptosis is a result of ATP depletion caused by Parp1 over-activation after IR. Thus,
since treatment for IR is limited in part because of a lack of understanding of the molecular events leading to
RGC death, a greater understanding of RGC necroptosis after IR will lead to new therapeutic strategies for this
important and difficult to treat condition."

The major goal of this project is to elucidate how stress negatively impacts health and accelerates aging. In
both animals and humans, repeated activation of the fight or flight response increases disease susceptibility
and reduces lifespan. How it does so is not well understood. In mammals, stress disorder symptoms are
associated with high levels of stress hormones such as adrenaline, which are released by the sympathetic
nervous system in response to acute stress. However, the complexity of the nervous system and the
multifaceted stress response in mammals makes the study of how the flight response impairs health and
accelerates aging an exceedingly difficult task. We propose to address this critical question in the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans. The genetic tractability, short lifespan, and relatively simple nervous system make
C. elegans an exceptional model to uncover mechanisms of stress physiology. We recently showed that
neural stress hormones that are released during the C. elegans flight response negatively impact animal´s
health and lifespan by activating the insulin pathway. We found that early larval stages are particularly
sensitive to the negative health impacts of the flight response. The flight response in C. elegans triggers the
release of tyramine, the invertebrate analog of adrenaline. Tyramine activates an adrenergic-like receptor in
the intestine, which in turn leads to the stimulation of the DAF-2/Insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway.
Stimulation of the DAF-2/IIS pathway inhibits the activation of multiple cytoprotective transcription factors
that enhance stress resistance. In contrast, long-term environmental stressors, such as heat, starvation or
oxidative stress, reduce tyramine release and inhibit IIS, thereby promoting the expression of cytoprotective
genes. Tyramine thus provides a state-dependent neural switch between the acute flight and long-term
environmental stress response. The link between neural stress hormones and the insulin pathway provides
a completely novel paradigm to understand how the perpetuated activation of the flight response negatively
affects health and shortens lifespan. We propose to combine genetics, pharmacology, behavioral analysis
and imaging techniques in C. elegans to elucidate how the flight response activates the insulin pathway and
negatively affects cytoprotective defense mechanisms. The aims of the proposal are 1: Determine how
neural stress hormones modulate ILP secretion from non-neuronal cells to inhibits cytoprotective
mechanisms; 2: Identify neural circuits that inhibit the release of neural stress hormones; 3: Determine the
mechanisms that underlie long-lasting impacts of early-life stress on health and aging. Completion of these
aims will provide a deep understanding into elusive mechanisms of neural modulation of the stress
response. We anticipate that new mechanistic insights into the neural control of the stress response in the
worm will be similarly relevant to mammalian physiology. The completion of these aims will undoubtedly
illuminate universal mechanisms of neural modulation of the stress response in animals, including humans.
Therefore, the findings emerging from these studies may ultimately inform the management of stress and
associated disorders."

10716176,"To optimize the function and independence of Veterans, it is critical to develop proactive treatments that
ameliorate and prevent disability and the resulting loss of quality of life and high cost health care associated
with the progression of chronic disease. 1 Ideally, these preventative treatments should be designed to target
Veterans at greatest risk and be personalized to their needs. This is critical for the VA since the mean age of
Veterans is 64 years and Veterans manifest greater impairment and functional limitations than their age-
matched civilian counterparts. 2,3 Aspects of personalization include a focus on impairments linked to not only
physical but cognitive function; and acknowledging that critical steps to preventative care include a focus on
behavior change of the patient. 1 Treatments promoting long term success commonly emphasize these
approaches. Rehabilitative care can play a leading role in this model of secondary preventative care. 4
Preventative rehabilitative care is known as prehabilitation. 5 This term traditionally refers to preventative pre-
surgical care and less frequently focuses on prevention and amelioration of disability among Veterans with
chronic disease. However, there is a tremendous unmet need to develop prehabilitative care treatments that
maximize the functional capacity of aging veterans and thereby extend quality of life as well as prevent
disability and excessive health care utilization. The Prehabilitation Center (PreHC) REAP will prioritize the
development of Prehabilitative Care strategies optimizing functioning among Veterans at risk for functional
decline and disability. Through the leadership of three organizational cores and the combination of qualifying
studies and pilot studies, the PreHC will develop a single data repository supporting three programmatic
research aims: 1) It will test the efficacy of novel therapeutic approaches on three important prehabilitative
outcomes (i.e., 3M’s): cognitive function (Mind); physical function (Mobility) and successful behavioral change
(Motivation); 2) It will identify biologic subtypes and phenotypes that mediate treatment response; 3) It will
confirm and validate these relationships using the large data resource derived from our collective studies and
through linkage with data from VA national databases. Our center will advance VA clinical research and
prehabilitative care by providing core resources and training for investigators of all levels. Under the leadership
of the Project Director (Dr. Bean), three operational cores will be created: 1) a Leadership, Capacity and
Advancement Core that will include the administrative leadership of the REAP and oversee all training and
education activities sponsored by PreHC, including administration of the pilot grant program for trainees and
junior faculty; 2) a Scientific Discovery Core that will provide state of the art assessment of neurocognitive
function (mind), physical function (mobility) and measures of behavior change (motivation); and 3) a Data
Management Core supporting the collection, monitoring, management and transfer of complex data, the
development of single data repository resulting from the qualifying and pilot studies and biostatistical support
assisting with study design and analysis. An internal steering committee will help oversee day to day
operations and programmatic success and an external advisory board of content experts will help guide the
achievement of the short- and long-term goals. We will use this resulting information to develop more
personalized Prehabilitative treatment approaches that will be tested for better meeting the personalized needs
of Veterans. Additionally, the resulting data repository will be an available resource for VA-based RR&D
researchers that will develop and grow with advancement of PreHC. In sum, over the next five years, the
PreHC will evolve into a national resource center that will conduct cutting-edge research in prehabilitative care.
The knowledge gained from this research will fill gaps in our current therapeutics to advance and maintain the
long-term health of aging Veterans."

who is establishing himself as an investigator in clinical research into the immunology of acute lung injury. This
CDA-2 award will provide Dr. Calabrese with the necessary support to accomplish the following goals: (1) to
improve the understanding of natural killer cells, their receptors, and their ligands in ischemia-reperfusion injury
(2) to acquire theoretical and practical skills in mouse and human immunology and bioinformatics (3) to establish
mechanistic foundations for future interventional trials to improve lung injury syndromes and (4) to establish an
independent basic laboratory scientist career focused on innate immunology in lung disease. To achieve these
goals, Dr. Calabrese has assembled a mentoring team consisting of his primary mentor, Dr. John Greenland, an
international expert in pulmonary immunology and lung injury, and a senior co-mentor Dr. Mary Nakamura, an
expert in the innate immune response to thoracic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). He has assembled a career
development committee and scientific advisory board that will additionally consist of: Dr. Lewis Lanier, an expert
in natural killer (NK) cell biology with over 50 mentees and 250 publications; Dr. Mark Looney, an expert in innate
mechanisms of acute lung injury and mouse models of lung transplantation; and, Dr. Jonathan Singer, director
of the UCSF lung transplant research program and an expert in lung transplant epidemiology research.
Additionally, he will have tutorials and scientific advice from Drs. Jason Christie, Dara Torgerson, Matthew
Spitzer, Michael Matthay, Anatoly Urisman in multi-institutional collaboration, statistical genetics, mass
cytometry, human lung experimental models, and pathology, respectively. The proposed research will expand
on strong preliminary data in two mouse models of lung injury and human samples showing a paradigm-
shifting role for NK cells in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). The proposed study will test the hypothesis
that NK cells directly mediate the lung injury observed in experimental and human ischemia-reperfusion injury
through receptor-specific interactions in the following specific aims: (1) To determine how NK cells are activated
and induce mouse pulmonary IRI (2) To determine how NK cells traffic to the lung during mouse pulmonary IRI
(3) To evaluate NK cell activation in human IRI. This work is innovative as these studies will make use of
advanced mouse surgical models and cutting-edge technologies such as next generation flow cytometry and
multiplex protein quantification to define a key innate immune response following lung injury. This research is
significant for veterans as it will identify pre-clinical and clinical therapies to use in veteran-health specific
diseases of acute respiratory distress syndrome, advanced lung disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke. This
work is novel as it will define a new role of NK cell receptors and stress ligands in IRI."
10931651,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the midst of the opioid epidemic, methamphetamine use is emerging as the next substance use crisis with
disproportionately increasing prevalence in men who have sex with men (MSM), high relapse rates and no
FDA-approved treatments for individuals with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD). One of the major
contributors to relapse is the enhanced motivated arousal (cue-reactivity) to drug-related cues, even after
protracted abstinence that leads to an increase in craving and drug-seeking. Although cue-reactivity is studied
widely in other substance use disorders, its study is scarce in MUD and non-existent in MSM with MUD,
creating a critical gap in knowledge needed for unbiased assessment of disease severity and treatment
outcomes in this rapidly growing clinical population. Therefore, in this bi-phased study, we propose to first
identify a psychophysiological marker of methamphetamine cue-reactivity and its incubation with abstinence
from methamphetamine use and examine group-differences between MSM and non-MSM MUD.
Subsequently, in the second phase we propose to longitudinally assess incubation of cue-reactivity, its
reduction with cognitive reappraisal (CR; a self-regulation technique) and examine the impact of CR on clinical
outcomes in MSM with MUD. In light of preliminary findings from our group, we hypothesize that LPP, an
electroencephalography-derived marker of drug cue-reactivity, will track the incubation of methamphetamine
cue-reactivity and its CR-mediated reduction, which in turn will be associated with improved clinical outcomes
in MSM with MUD. In the R61 phase, we will cross-sectionally compare the LPP-assessed cue-reactivity
between currently using (Group 1) and abstinent (1-3 months; Group 2) individuals with MUD (50% MSM in
each group, matched on HIV status), and examine in-task changes in cue-reactivity with CR technique. In the
R33 phase, we will assign a cohort of MUD to either the CR+ (Cognitive Reappraisal training) or the CR- (no
Cognitive Reappraisal training) group (all MSM, matched on HIV status), and cue-reactivity will be assessed
longitudinally at <2 weeks, 2 months, to 3 months after abstinence initiation. Successful completion of these
aims will identify an EEG-based, objective, and clinically useful marker of methamphetamine cue-reactivity,
and will delineate the impact of CR on methamphetamine cue-reactivity in relation to treatment response in
MSM with MUD. This work will be the beginning of mechanistic research into the role of incubation of
methamphetamine cue-reactivity and its reduction as a reliable and clinically meaningful outcome measure,
establishing an empirical foundation to develop an intervention for MUD and possibly in other addictions."

11072198,"MICROSCOPY SHARED RESOURCE ABSTRACT
Cancer research encompasses a broad range of investigations ranging from the behavior of cancer cells in the
body, to the changes in cancer cells at the molecular level. This requires a spectrum of tools that enable
imaging individual cells and their interactions, both at the level of the whole animal, as well as at the molecular
level of molecules inside the cells. The Microscopy Shared Resource (MSR) provides training, access, support
and expertise that enable Moores Cancer Center (MCC) members to successfully utilize basic and advanced
microscopy techniques and instrumentation in their studies. The MSR facility is open 24 hours/7 days per week
and provides access to a wide array of microscopy instrumentation, auxiliary equipment and reagents. The
MSR is pivotal in providing investigators access and expertise to high-end instruments for their studies that
they could not afford otherwise. These instruments include regular epi-fluorescence, bright field and phase
contrast microscopy, confocal, super resolution, Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), total internal
reflection fluorescence (TIRF), and deconvolution on fixed samples and live cells. The IVIS 200 imaging
system can be used for 3-dimensional optical imaging and non-invasive monitoring of cancer progression,
gene expression patterns, cell trafficking, drug delivery and treatment in living animals. Researchers can use
super resolution fluorescence to examine interactions between proteins and other molecules using
excitation/deactivation of photo-switchable fluorescent probes. The MSR staff provides highly qualified didactic
and hands on training in basic microscopy principles in addition to complex techniques. By bringing together
investigators with diverse interests and common goals, the MSR fosters a spirit of collaboration and
cooperation that leads us closer to the ultimate goals of cancer treatment and cure."
11072199,"TRANSGENIC MOUSE SHARED RESOURCE ABSTRACT
The availability of the Transgenic Mouse Shared Resource (TMSR) enables our investigators at the Moores
Cancer Center (MCC) to conduct versatile, cutting-edge research with a battery of sophisticated genetic
techniques for manipulation of the mouse genome to create models for studies of cancer for incisive in vivo
mechanistic investigations of the fundamental processes involved in the etiology of tumor development and
metastasis. Transgenic mice carrying new or novel genes are created by microinjection of DNA into the
pronuclei of fertilized eggs, specific deletions and mutations are created using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and
“knock-out” mice that have deleted or modified genes of interest are created by homologous recombination in
embryonic stem cells followed by injection into blastocysts to create chimeric mice for breeding to
homozygosity. The high degree of conservation of most sequences in genomes of humans and mice makes
using mouse genetic manipulation technology to create models of human cancer pathogenesis extremely
useful. These approaches are remarkably powerful in cancer research, particularly in the analysis of
oncogenes, metastasis, cell-cycle control, tumor suppressor genes, and in the crafting of cancer model
systems for developing new treatment regimens, and methods for drug testing and tumor imaging. The mission
of this Shared Resource is to provide the highly technical aspects of manipulation of genes in embryos and
mouse embryonic stem cells as a service to MCC members, to create the genetically manipulated mouse
models they need. This is an example of how specialized techniques, highly trained and dedicated personnel,
and expensive equipment can be accessed by researchers who could not reasonably expect to develop or
obtain them on an individual basis. The TMSR provides cutting-edge, rapidly advancing, efficient, cost-effective
services that adapt to the needs of our users, drive the field of mouse genetics, and continue to be very
responsive to the vast creativity of the CCSG membership, fulfilling their needs for the most cutting-edge
embryology and molecular genetics in the mouse."

and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) reporting, as well as interim and final analyses. The BSR supports
statistical review for the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC) and DSMC. BSR services are
divided between short-term consulting supported by the CCSG without charge to MCC investigators, and
longer-term collaboration that is funded from collaborative grants. Service requests are accepted in person, by
phone, email, or web request, and are tracked using a web-based system. Improvements during the reporting
period have been recruitment of new participating Biostatistics faculty with addition of specialized expertise in
natural language processing and in image analysis, an increase in the total statistical FTE in the BSR, and
increased training in Cancer Biostatistics through outreach to MCC members and coordination with the UCSD
Biostatistics PhD program. Future plans include moving towards Clinical Data Interchange Standards
Consortium (CDISC) compliant data capture, and further diversifying key areas of biostatistics faculty expertise
through additional recruitments. During the period 2013-2017, the BSR supported 150 different investigators,
co-authored 136 cancer-related, peer-reviewed papers, and assisted with 215 grant submissions. Furthermore,
the BSR assisted in developing 73 therapeutic protocols, with 21 currently active and 13 recently completed
therapeutic studies. 124 MCC members representing all 5 programs used BSR services, accounting for 89% of
shared resource utilization. The BSR received 20% of its funding from the CCSG."

10893354,"Abstract: Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) serves as a staple crop for more than 600 million people in
tropical regions of the world. Two types of cassava are traditionally grown across the globe, the “sweet” and
“bitter” varieties, the latter being an environmentally tolerant plant, harboring extremely high to lethal doses of
toxic cyanogenic compounds. Chronic dietary reliance on toxic cassava is associated with cyanide
neurotoxicity, causing an irreversible, non-progressive motor neuron disease known as konzo and possibly,
deficits in neurocognition. Within prone regions of sub-Saharan Africa, there are a disproportionate number of
children affected for reasons and mechanisms that have yet to be fully elucidated. While nearly most subjects
in konzo-affected villages rely heavily on cyanogenic cassava as a staple food, only about 5 to 10% present
with a visible spastic paraparesis. This suggests that exposure levels, nutrition, and environmental components
such as the detoxification capabilities of the gut microbiome are likely contributing factors in disease
susceptibility. We have shown that the gut flora profiles are significantly different between adolescents who rely
on cassava with low-high levels of toxicity in the DRC. Even within a region of the DRC that is highly
susceptible to outbreaks of disease, there are marked differences in bacterial composition between unaffected
individuals depending on whether they reside in villages with historically high or low konzo prevalence, again
adding to the likelihood of disease modulation through the gut microbiome. Based on insight from our
preliminary and published data, we will investigate if there are functional differences in the gut-flora between
sex-matched sibling pairs who are discordant for disease, by utilizing metagenomic and transcriptomic
sequencing approaches on stool specimens (Aim 1). Using the same study population, we will also determine
if metabolic biomarkers are identifiable that indicate a disease state or susceptibility using state-of-the-art
metabolic applications, such as ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry
(UHPLC-MS/MS) (Aim 2). The data generated from both approaches will enable us to not only assess the
profiles and functionality of the gut microbiome in relation to disease status, but will provide the power to
determine the host-microbiome interaction in regards to downstream metabolic processes. Given that the
World Health Organization estimates that the burden and deaths resulting from non-communicable diseases
(NCDs) will surpass those from malaria and HIV combined, in the coming years, we have embedded a
comprehensive advanced training plan to expand knowledge on pertinent topics relating to NCDs, such as
nutrition, toxicology, neuroepidemiology and other relevant disciplines. Collectively, this proposal and training
plan will significantly expand our understanding of disease modulators associated with cassava neurotoxicity
that can be potentially used for monitoring and prevention strategies, while providing adequate academic and
research-based training for an independent global health scientific career."
10896148,"ABSTRACT:
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) disproportionately impacts Latino children, families and communities. T2D disparities
are the result of complex interactions that involve biological susceptibility and various interdependent social
determinants that represent the root causes of disease. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) established that
T2D can be prevented in high-risk adults through intensive lifestyle intervention. Although the DPP has been
translated to a variety of adult populations and settings, engagement and effectiveness is diminished in minority
communities and there are no family-focused diabetes prevention trials for Latinos. For over a decade, our team
has collaborated to address the social and cultural determinants of diabetes among Latino youth, in the midst of
extant disparities in access to care, low health literacy, and certain cultural norms that may increase diabetes
risk. Our culturally-grounded approach is guided by an Ecodevelopmental model that considers community,
family, peer, and individual-level factors that influence health behaviors and health outcomes over time. Through
a series of increasingly rigorous studies we established that a lifestyle intervention can significantly reduce T2D
risk factors and increase Quality of Life (QoL) among Latino adolescents with obesity. We now propose to build
upon our extensive experience working with the local Latino community to rigorously test the efficacy of a
family-focused diabetes prevention intervention for reducing T2D risk and increasing QoL among high-risk
Latino families. We will use Integrative Mixed Methods to understand how family structures and processes
influence intervention outcomes. We will examine the sustainability of the intervention at 12-months and explore
mediators and moderators of long-term changes. Lastly, we acknowledge that the current translational gap
between scientific discovery and real-world impact must be closed so that evidence-based interventions are
expeditiously scaled to advance towards health equity for vulnerable and underserved populations. Therefore,
we will use the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework to guide areas for
adaptation and integration within key community-based organizations that may be well-positioned to adopt and
implement family-focused diabetes prevention programs. Our long-term goal is to build the evidence, network,
and capacity to scale multi-level, family-focused diabetes prevention programs across systems that serve
vulnerable and disadvantaged communities. As the next step towards this goal, we propose the following
Primary Aim: Test the efficacy of a 4-month, family-focused diabetes prevention intervention, compared to a
family control condition, for improving glucose tolerance and increasing QoL among high-risk Latino families.
Secondary Aim: Understand how family structure and family processes influence the reach, diffusion, and
impact of the intervention on the family system. Exploratory Aim: Examine mediators and moderators of 12-
month changes in glucose tolerance and QoL. Implementation Aim: Create a statewide, stakeholder-
informed plan to take family diabetes prevention to scale by 1) generating a rapid learning community with
organizations that serve Latino families in Arizona, 2) exploring the need, readiness, costs of, and capacity for
implementation across these organizations, and 3) planning adaptations and activities to enhance fit and
function of the intervention within these organizations."
10672400,"One in three women and one in five men age ≥50 years will experience an osteoporotic fracture in their
lifetime. Falls are common with 25% of older adults reporting ≥1 fall and 12-15% reporting ≥2 falls annually
with costs to Medicare in 2015 of $31 billion. More recently, fall death rates in the US have steadily increased.
Therefore, identifying modifiable risk factors for falls and fractures is essential. Sleep disturbances are
common in the US with up to 60% of older adults meeting criteria for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).
Intermittent hypoxemia (IH) is the hallmark of obstructive sleep apnea. The long-term goal of the project is to
describe the prospective association between sleep disturbances including objective measures of IH, SDB,
sleep duration, sleep efficiency and disrupted circadian rest-activity rhythms and incident fractures and
recurrent falls in older women and men. The scientific premise is that poor sleep increases the risk of falls
and fractures through several mechanisms including IH and SDB. This proposal builds on two large well-
characterized studies that enrolled older men and women: WHISPER: Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) Sleep
Hypoxia Effect on Resilience, and the Outcomes of Sleep Disorders in Older Men Study (MrOS Sleep Study).
WHISPER is an observational study of sleep disorders and their relationship to cardiovascular disease, cancer
and cognitive impairment. WHISPER recruited 4959 WHI participants for in home sleep testing (including
oximetry and SDB assessment) and 6-day wrist actigraphy. We propose to extend WHISPER to include the
important clinical and geriatric outcomes of recurrent falls and fractures. We also propose to capitalize
on the existing data from the MrOS Sleep Study to provide comparable data on men to test whether the
associations between poor sleep and risk of falls and fractures differ by sex. In the MrOS Sleep Study, 2865
men participated in a sleep assessment including wrist actigraphy and in-home polysomnography with
overnight oximetry. We demonstrated that nocturnal hypoxemia is associated with greater risk of recurrent
falls and non-spine fractures in older men. However, there are no studies of comprehensive sleep measures
including IH and falls and fractures in older women despite established sex differences in sleep disorders and
fractures. We will test the hypotheses that IH as measured by % sleep time oxygen saturation (SaO2) <90%
and SDB will be associated with an increased risk of recurrent falls (Aim 1) and fractures (Aim 2) independent
of sleep fragmentation. Secondary aims will test the hypotheses that short or long sleep duration, sleep
efficiency and fragmentation and disrupted circadian rhythms, (all from actigraphy) are also associated with
recurrent falls (Aim 1) and fractures (Aim 2) and these associations are independent of IH. Finally, we will
perform parallel analyses in men to explore sex differences (Aim 3). Extending WHISPER to include falls and
fractures is a cost-efficient opportunity to substantially increase our understating of the impact of sleep on the
health of older adults."
10914017,"Project Summary/Abstract
Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in both women and men.
Preterm delivery (PTD) occurs in 10% of US pregnancies and is associated with twice the risk of long-term
CVD morbidity and mortality in mothers. Only 13-17% of the association between PTD and CVD is explained
by subsequent development of established cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes,
hyperlipidemia and obesity. Our poor understanding of the physiologic pathways from PTD to CVD limits our
ability to use PTD as an `early warning system' to better prevent and treat CVD in women. The goal of this
project is to expand our understanding of PTD and CVD through discovery and validation of metabolomic
signatures and scores among women with a history of PTD, confirming their association with CVD events and
performing mediation analysis. We will also examine the association of PTD clinical phenotypes with CVD.
Setting: We have assembled an exceptional team with deep expertise in CVD, pregnancy exposures,
metabolomics, and biostatistics/ bioinformatics. Investigators on this project have decades of experience
studying CVD, pregnancy complications, and metabolomic epidemiological studies. This application will
leverage U01-funded infrastructure and biosamples of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) 2 and 3 cohorts, as well
as CVD outcomes and previously measured metabolomic profiles in NHS1 and the Women's Health Initiative.
Research Plan: We will measure metabolomic profiles in 1500 women, including 400 women with a history of
PTD, and 400 parous women with no preterm deliveries. Metabolomics will be performed at the Broad Institute.
Using a robust methodology of discovery and validation, we will: 1) Discover and validate metabolomic
profiles and PTD metabolite (M-PTD) scores for midlife women with a history of PTD (NHS2/3). PTD
phenotypes to be examined: a) Total PTD; b) Clinical PTD: Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes,
spontaneous preterm labor with intact membranes, medically-indicated PTD; c) Timing of PTD: <32 weeks, 32-
<37 weeks; Exploratory: Agnostically derived metabolite endotypes of PTD; 2) Examine the association of
clinical PTD phenotypes with CVD incidence (NHS2 full dataset); 3) Test the association of M-PTD
scores with incident CVD (NHS1, NHS2, WHI) and determine mediation of the observed increased CVD
risk from PTD metabolites (NHS2). Relevance to Public Health: CVD is an issue of major public health
importance. The proposed analyses have the potential to identify precursors and pathways integral to CVD
incidence after PTD, a female-specific cardiovascular risk factor, which may then be used to improve
prevention strategies, enhance treatment options, and generate additional testable hypotheses that will guide
future CVD research. Our approach leverages decades of prospective data collection in the NHS2 and NHS3
and our strong preliminary data support a high likelihood of success."
10870208,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy is a key component of treatment for patients with newly diagnosed
glioblastoma (GBM) and provides clinically meaningful survival benefits. Cytotoxicity from TMZ results from
failure to repair TMZ-induced DNA methylation adducts. During replication, these lesions ultimately result in
replication fork collapse associated with DNA double strand breaks that are critically repaired by homologous
recombination (HR). In this context, we recently discovered that retinoblastoma binging protein 4 (RBBP4)
functions in a complex with histone acetyltransferase p300 (p300) as a epigenetic writer to key DNA repair
processes including six key HR genes (RAD50, BRCA1, BARD1 BRIP1 FIGNL1, and RAD51) that play
different roles in HR pathway. Specifically, knockdown of either RBBP4 or p300 in glioma cell lines and GBM
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models results in marked suppression of these six gene products, impaired
HR activity associated with enhanced sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, and dramatically enhanced sensitivity to
TMZ in animal models. Downstream of RBBP4/p300 complex, bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET)
family members (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4) function as key readers of p300-mediated acetylation marks to drive
gene expression. Based on this and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the RBBP4/p300/BRD axis is a
key regulator of HR efficiency and is a promising pharmacologic strategy for developing a robust, novel, TMZ-
sensitizing strategy. There are both p300- and dual p300/BET-inhibitors now entering clinical testing in
oncology, which highlight the importance of fully understanding how this complex functions to regulate DNA
repair. We will explore this concept in a series of three specific aims:
Aim 1: Define the role of RBBP4/p300 in regulation of HR genes. We will extend our initial observations in
GBM43 to define the regulation of HR genes across multiple GBM models by this complex.
Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of RBBP4/p300 on DNA repair proficiency. We hypothesize that coordinated
suppression of multiple HR genes associated with disruption of RBBP4/p300/BET function results in profound
HR suppression and TMZ sensitizing effects as compared to modulation of only one component of HR.
Aim 3: Define the impact of targeting the p300/BRD4 axis on therapy response in GBM We will test the
efficacy of p300 and p300/BET inhibitors alone and in combination with TMZ in PDX models. Ultimately, these
studies are designed to provide a strong rationale to pursue these inhibitors in clinical trials for GBM."

 We have prepared this application in response to RFA-NS-20-031, which invites applicants to serve as the
NINDS Human Biospecimen and Data Repository in Neurological Disorders. The BioSpecimen Exchange for
Neurological Disorders (BioSEND) was awarded to Indiana University on September 30, 2015. This application
proposes to renew and retain BioSEND at Indiana University and expand the impact and success of BioSEND
through additional innovations and improvements.
 With the transfer of the NINDS-funded biorepository to Indiana University, BioSEND dramatically expanded
the number of disorders for which samples are banked. The scope and scale of banking has also dramatically
increased with the establishment of BioSEND at Indiana University. The value of the biospecimens banked at
BioSEND is demonstrated by the substantial growth in the requests for these samples by researchers. Over the
past five years, BioSEND has made 93 distributions to 42 investigators at more than 30 institutions.
 Indiana University has developed a strong biorepository team consisting of faculty with critical scientific and
leadership experience and staff with essential expertise in biobanking, clinical research coordination, and data
management. Over the past five years, we have developed a strong infrastructure and implemented a customer-
focused approach that employs innovative solutions to both specimen banking and distribution. Based on our
success in establishing a widely used biospecimen repository, we plan further improvements and expansion of
BioSEND to meet the NINDS mission to increase biobanking to support basic, translational and clinical research
in neurological disorders. We propose to pursue the following specific aims for the next five years:
Aim 1: Provide leadership to BioSEND
Aim 2: Provide study management expertise
Aim 3: Provide scientific and laboratory expertise
Aim 4: Distribute samples to approved researchers
Aim 5: Develop custom solutions to link clinical data with biospecimens"

Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are especially at risk for missed diabetes visits
and suboptimal self-care behaviors, as evidenced by their poor glycemic control with very high A1c levels.
Further, diabetes distress is common in AYA with T1D and contributes to their suboptimal self-care behaviors
and outcomes. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends routine screening for diabetes distress
and, when identified, referral for diabetes education or mental health treatment. Persons experiencing diabetes
distress are at increased risk for missed medical appointments and deficient diabetes self-management. This is
concerning because, without intervention, diabetes distress does not remit and either remains stable or
intensifies over time. Further, AYAs may not adequately access or use advanced diabetes technologies due to
perceptions of possible increases in self-care burden and diabetes distress when, in fact, such technologies
could aid in their efforts to enhance self-care and improve glycemic control. Thus, there is an urgent need to
develop practical and widely accessible interventions that target diabetes distress, self-care, and glycemic
control and include face-to-face and remote visits to facilitate uptake. In the proposed 2-year randomized
clinical trial, we will implement and assess the impact of a behavioral/psychoeducational intervention to reduce
diabetes distress, increase acceptance of self-care behaviors (with or without diabetes technologies), and
improve glycemic outcomes in AYAs with T1D. As a group, AYAs with T1D represent the subpopulation of all
persons with T1D across the lifespan that has the poorest glycemic control, reaching a peak mean A1c value
>9% at age ~19. AYAs with T1D often experience diabetes distress, which is linked to poor glycemic control,
making them ideal participants for the proposed study. We will recruit 180 AYAs (ages 14-25) with T1D
duration of at least 1 year and suboptimal diabetes control (A1c 8-13%). Participants will be randomly assigned
to a usual care control condition or the intervention group. The intervention group will participate in monthly
intervention sessions with a study interventionist during the first year. Of the monthly sessions, 4 will focus on
improving glycemic outcomes in face-to-face sessions and 8 will focus on reducing diabetes distress in remote,
virtual sessions to limit study burden (and in recognition of paradigm changes in care delivery during SARS-
CoV-2 pandemic). To ensure adequate recruitment and retention, the control group will receive a delayed
intervention and participate in the monthly sessions during the second year of the study. Both groups will use
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for 14 days every 3 months and complete surveys every 6 months. A1c
will also be measured centrally every 6 months. We will compare the two groups on the primary glycemic
outcome of percent time-in-range (TIR) of 70-180 mg/dL assessed by CGM and on the secondary outcomes of
diabetes distress and A1c from baseline to 1 year. We hypothesize that the intervention group will have an
improvement in percent TIR, diabetes distress, and A1c compared with the usual care control group."

This proposal presents a five-year research career development program focused on optimizing the physical
and biological characteristics of phosphorylated poly(ester ureas) (pPEU) for the stabilization and healing of rib
fractures. The candidate is currently an Assistant Professor of Surgery and acute and critical care trauma
surgeon at Duke University, with previous research experience in biologic materials and tissue engineering
research. He has now chosen to focus on materials science and mechanical engineering with a diverse
mentoring committee of investigators with expertise in materials, polymers, musculoskeletal reparative
processes and stem cell research. The proposed experiments and didactic work will provide the candidate with
a unique set of skills that will help him transition to independence as a surgeon-scientist and enable him to fill a
significant “experience gap” in the field of research dedicated to rib fractures and wound healing.
Rib fractures account for nearly 40% of all bone fractures sustained in the each year, with over a quarter million
rib injuries. These injuries can have long-lasting effects, sometimes even for life. Over half of rib fracture patients
contract pneumonia, and nearly two thirds will still experience significant pain in the chest wall years after
sustaining the injury. While stabilization of a fracture promotes faster healing and decreased rates of non-union
(failure of a broken bone to heal), rib fractures present a unique challenge in that immobilization can only be
accomplished through invasive surgical intervention. Therefore, unlike long bone fractures where immediate
stabilization is standard, this is reserved in rib fractures for only the most severe cases. Poly(ester ureas) (PEU)
are amino acid based biodegradable polymers with bone like mechanical properties. One such phosphorylated
PEU (pPEU) copolymer, based on phosphoserine (pSer) is ethanol soluble allowing for injection, with strong
bone adhesion and high elastic moduli, making pPEU’s ideal as an innovative, non-invasive solution for the
stabilization of rib fractures. However, the effect of pSer stoichiometry on PEU copolymer osteoinduction remains
unknown, as well as if a provisional elastomeric callus using resorbable PEU based adhesive can accelerate
bone healing through early fracture stabilization. This proposal will determine the relationships between the
physical and biologic characteristics of injectable pSer-PEU for osteoinduction and test the safety and
performance of pSer-PEU in a rat model of rib fracture. The work of this proposal will 1) characterize the
relationship of pSer stoichiometry within the PEU copolymers on biomechanics (tensile strength, elastic modulus,
and stiffness), and interfascial adhesion of pSer-PEU; 2) quantify bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) cytoskeletal
reorganization and osteoinduction to increased stiffness, and 3) evaluate fracture stability and callus formation
in a rat rib fracture model with best performing pSer-PEU. The results of this work will serve as the basis for
future projects focused on using functionalized biomaterials to understand the cellular mechanisms of fracture
healing in order to optimize healing in the high risk trauma patient."

10768778,"Project Summary/Abstract
As the population ages, Latinx communities, families, and healthcare systems will be confronted by the
growing crisis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Identifying factors that confer resilience
to ADRD among aging Latinx communities is of critical importance to successfully reduce disparities. Some
studies find that bilinguals are at reduced AD risk compared to monolinguals, but other studies do not find
evidence of a bilingual advantage. Little attention has been given to within-group differences among bilinguals,
such as age of second language (L2) acquisition, proficiency, and frequency of language use, and how these
differences 1) are related to cognitive function in older age, 2) if they buffer the effects of neuropathology on
cognitive decline, and 3) how cognitive decline in AD can influence language use among bilinguals.
Determination of the aspects of bilingualism that confer resilience to AD could lead to novel interventions to
mitigate cognitive aging and ADRD disparities. The overall aim of this proposed research is to determine
whether aspects of bilingualism, including age of acquisition, language use, and proficiency, buffer the effects
of neuroimaging markers of pathology (i.e., AD biomarkers and cerebrovascular disease) on cognition and
cognitive decline within middle- and older-aged Latinx adults. The central hypothesis is that early age of L2
acquisition, greater daily use of both L1 and L2, and greater L2 proficiency will confer cognitive reserve,
independent of confounding sociocultural factors (i.e., education, socioeconomic status, immigration). Aims 1a
and 1b (K99) focus on identifying which aspects of bilingualism are associated with cognition and which
moderate the relationship between imaging markers and cognition. Aims 2a and 2b (R00) proposes to
determine the relationship between bilingualism and imaging markers on cognitive decline and determine
whether change in cognitive status is associated with changes in bilingualism. The proposed study will
harmonize data from Latinx adults currently enrolled in three longitudinal cohorts with available amyloid and
tau PET, MRI, and cognitive assessments: the Offspring study and the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia
Aging Project at Columbia University, and the University of California-Davis Diversity Aging Cohort. To
accomplish these goals, the applicant will build on his strengths in cultural neuropsychology, health disparities,
and statistical methods by obtaining training during the K99 phase on 1) expanding knowledge of the cognitive
neuroscience and psycholinguistics of bilingualism; 2) modeling neuroimaging data; 3) the operationalization
and measurement of resilience among aging Latinx populations; and 4) enhancing statistical methods focused
on data harmonization, casual inference methods and latent variable modeling. This K99/R00 proposal lays the
foundation for an independent research career focused on mechanisms underlying the protective factors of
bilingualism and biculturalism in cognitive aging in a diverse population."
10927313,"Pilot Projects Program - Abstract
The Pilot Projects Program (PPP) is an integral component of the COBRE in Oxidants, Redox Balance and
Stress Signaling and supports our mission to drive innovative redox-related basic and translational studies using
the Center’s core resources and technologies. The overall goal of this program is to continue the significant
momentum we have gained from the first two Phases of this COBRE by providing and prioritizing short-term
funding for pilot studies that are designed to address important scientific questions in redox and signaling
disciplines. We have incorporated innovative features of the PPP in this Phase III application, building on
informatics tools and web resources developed and maintained by the South Carolina Clinical & Translational
Institute (SCTR) that serve as CTSA-supported infrastructure, but provide a platform for electronic submission
and review of applications and progress reports. The PPP will continue to provide and prioritize short-term
funding through a competitive program which incorporates open solicitation, peer review and funding in three
grant categories: Discovery: Attracting junior faculty without prior extramural funding to oxidants, redox balance
and stress signaling research; New Direction: Enticing established investigators in other areas of biomedical
research; and Feasibility: Enabling established redox investigators to explore an area that represents a
significant departure from their currently funded work. The ultimate goal of the program is to provide adequate
resources and training for pilot investigators to develop sufficient preliminary data to prepare a competitive
extramural grant application that will directly utilize one or more of the COBRE cores. Our ultimate goal will be
to use these funds to leverage additional funds and ideas that will expand participation and scientific
competitiveness for the Center. Requests for applications will be solicited annually, four months in advance of
the anticipated award date. Decisions related to the awarding of funds will be based on a rigorous and
independent three-phase peer-review process that is modeled on the NIH system. The initial level of review will
involve screening of proposals to verify that applications meet the eligibility criteria. The second will involve a
panel of internal experts whose primary function will be to evaluate the scientific and technical merits of
applications. A third level of review will be performed by the External Advisory Board. Applications will be scored
using the NIH scale and prioritized according to four criteria: 1) Quality of the research (scientific merit,
innovation, and impact); 2) Relevance to the mission of the Center and direct involvement of one or more COBRE
Cores in the research plan; 3) qualifications of the research team to lead the research effort toward securing
extramural funding and 4) stimulation of collaborative efforts with Center members. We plan to fund two new
and/or continuation projects per year at $50,000 or $75,000 each for one to two years of support. We also
envision that the PPP will enable investigators to form cooperative, interdisciplinary projects where sustainable
studies can be turned into programmatic multi-investigator grant applications (e.g. U or P awards – we have
been successful in garnering U awards, see Overall section) that will have a long-term impact on redox and cell
signaling research at MUSC."
10895379,"The Methods Core will ensure the methodological innovation and rigor of the Penn Innovation in Suicide
Prevention Implementation Research (INSPIRE) Center’s studies. The Core will respond to the needs of and
leverage the opportunities provided by INSPIRE research to develop, implement, and test new methods to
address three major questions at the intersection of suicide prevention and implementation science: 1) What are
the best ways to adapt and implement evidence-based suicide prevention interventions in a variety of settings
to optimize reach, effectiveness, and sustainability? 2) How do we accurately and efficiently measure fidelity to
evidence-based suicide prevention interventions upon scale-up? 3) As we move from research to practice, how
do we provide accurate information on associated costs that can be used for system planning? The Methods
Core will lead dissemination efforts for these new tools as well as Center research findings, ensuring that
INSPIRE becomes a local and national resource to the research, practice, and consumer communities beyond
the University of Pennsylvania. Method Core members will be experts in suicide prevention, implementation
science, statistics, economics, machine learning, qualitative research, and participatory design. Methods and
models from each of these disciplines will undergird our projects. The Methods Core has four Specific Aims.
Aim 1: As a scientific incubator, refine and develop new methods to answer three major challenges in the field
of suicide prevention research, including (a) optimizing intervention adaptation and implementation strategy
design; (b) developing efficient and effective strategies for fidelity measurement using machine learning; and (c)
advancing the science of measuring implementation costs for suicide prevention interventions. Aim 2: Provide
centralized state-of-the-science assessment, data management, statistical, and human subject protections
support to INSPIRE Projects, Pilot Studies, and subsequent research applications. The Core will ensure rigor
and adherence to highest ethical and research standards across all Center research by centralizing Institutional
Review Board and Data Safety Monitoring Board review and study design and data analysis resources. The
Core will maximize the potential for data pooling and sharing through use of common measures and data
harmonization. Aim 3: Disseminate INSPIRE scientific resources. Our research findings will inform both research
and practice in suicide prevention; Aim 1 will result in research tools that will be made freely-available to suicide
and other researchers. We will leverage national networks, University of Pennsylvania’s communications
apparatus, and the INSPIRE website to disseminate these resources widely to multiple sectors. Aim 4: Ensure
rigorous evaluation of INSPIRE’s research productivity and impact by providing strategic, methodological, and

to optimize evaluation of INSPIRE."
10895388,"The Signature Project of the Penn Innovation in Suicide Prevention Implementation Research (INSPIRE) Center
is a large-scale research study designed to examine the effectiveness and implementation of an evidence-based
intervention to lower suicide risk in health care settings. The Project will leverage the methodological and
administrative support of the INSPIRE Center with its focus on optimizing implementation of practice-based
suicide prevention interventions for minority and disadvantaged populations. Individuals at high risk for suicide
often present to acute care settings, such as emergency departments (EDs), and then typically are hospitalized
or referred for outpatient mental health treatment. Yet, despite being at increased risk of suicidal behavior and
suicide following an ED visit, many patients do not attend outpatient treatment. Brief evidenced-based
interventions such as the Safety Planning Intervention and follow-up services (SPI+) are available to mitigate
this risk and engage patients in outpatient treatment. However, such practices often can be challenging for busy
ED clinicians to provide for suicidal patients. Our interdisciplinary team of suicide, implementation, health
services, qualitative and quantitative researchers as well as diverse stakeholder groups of ED clinicians, health
systems leaders, mental health clinicians, and patients will collaborate to improve the delivery of ED-based
suicide prevention efforts. We propose a novel delivery model in which ED staff will connect patients at risk for
suicide to mental health clinicians who are located external to the ED. These off-site licensed and credentialed
clinicians will provide SPI+ via telehealth for ED patients prior to discharge and provide follow-up services after
ED discharge as part of an innovative Suicide Prevention Consultation Center (SPCC). The Project has three
Specific Aims. Aim 1 will use a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized design to evaluate the effectiveness of SPI+
delivered by SPCC clinicians via telehealth compared to SPI+ delivered by SPI+-trained ED clinicians on rates
of suicidal behavior and engagement in care following ED discharge. Aim 2 will evaluate the implementation of
SPI+ delivered by SPCC clinicians compared to SPI+ delivered by ED clinicians on key implementation
outcomes including adoption, fidelity, acceptability, and feasibility and will also explore the mediation of clinician
intentions, norms, and self-efficacy on the fidelity of SPI+. Aim 3 will evaluate the costs to ED and SPCC practices
and examine potential cost offsets to the health system to provide evidence of SPCC scalability and
sustainability. If successful and cost effective, use of a SPCC, external to EDs, could become a scalable model
for providing suicide prevention evidenced-based practices to those at risk for suicide presenting for emergency
care with the potential to save lives."

10902046,"In perinatal mice, endothelial-specific inactivation of Krit1 (Krev1 interaction trapped gene1) leads to cerebral 
cavernous malformations (CCM), whereas inactivation of Krit1 (Krit1ECKO) or its binding partner HEG1 in adults 
does not. Krit1ECKO or Heg1ECKO results in increased expression of transcription factors KLF2 and KLF4 (Krüppel- 
like factors 2 and 4); these transcription factors are important in the capacity of laminar blood flow to modulate 
endothelial expression of vasoactive, anticoagulant, and anti-inflammatory factors resulting in vasoprotection 
from inflammation and thrombosis. In preliminary studies, we have found that adult Krit1ECKO endothelial cells 
(EC) increase expression of vasoprotective genes regulated by KLF2 and KLF4, including eNOS and the protein 
C activation cofactor, thrombomodulin (TM). Adult Krit1ECKO mice show marked elevation of KLF4 expression in 
aortas suggesting possible vasoprotection from atherosclerosis. In addition, the increase in endothelial TM and 
EPCR following loss of KRIT1 was accompanied by an increased capacity of EC to generate activated protein 
C (APC), a natural anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory protein. The scientific premise of this proposal is that 
genetic inactivation of Krit1, by upregulating KLF2 and KLF4, may mimic the vasoprotective effects of laminar 
flow on endothelium, thereby reducing thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and vascular inflammation. Moreover, we 
suggest that this effect of flow can also be mimicked by small molecules that disrupt the KRIT1-HEG1 interaction. 
To examine these ideas: Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that genetic inactivation of Krit1 will 
protect mice from thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and vascular inflammation. In core A (Bergmeier), we will 
investigate the effect of Krit1ECKO or Heg1ECKO in hemostasis and thrombosis in vivo. Since upregulation in eNOS 
expression leads to increased levels of NO, a known inhibitor of platelet function and leukocyte adhesion, in 
collaboration with project 2 and core A, we will study models of inflammation-induced vascular activation and 
atherosclerosis in Krit1ECKO mice. We will primarily focus on genetic inactivation of endothelial Krit1 but will also 
use endothelial Heg1 genetic inactivation when warranted. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that 
pharmacologic disruption of the HEG1-KRIT1 protein complex in EC can promote vasoprotection. We 
will examine the effect of a small-molecule, HKi002, on the expression of vasoprotective genes, eNOS and TM, 
in ECs. The effect of HKi002 on NO and APC generation will be investigated using ECs from different vascular 
beds. In this context, we will determine the effect of HKi002 on cytokine-induced inflammation and endothelial 
barrier properties by assessing expression of adhesion molecules/leukocyte adhesion and by analyzing 
intercellular junction integrity/actomyosin contractility. Altogether by combining organismal and cell-based 
approaches, we will provide an analysis of the effects of disrupting KRIT1-HEG1 protein complex in adult 
vasculature and vasoprotection and set the stage for testing the idea that pharmacological disruption of the 
complex can suppress inflammation and thrombosis."

programs and activities within AK INBRE 4 partner institutions: University of Alaska Fairbanks (lead doctoral
institution), University of Alaska Southeast, University of Alaska Anchorage and two Tribal health
organizations, Southcentral Foundation and Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. The AC facilitates overall
coordination and sharing of resources among all IDeA and other NIH programs, University of Alaska
campuses, and other Alaska network partners with similar infrastructure and inclusion goals in Alaska. The AC
is a hub for communication, outreach, and program activities fostering collaboration and interactions across
Alaska. AK INBRE 4 PI/PD Brian Barnes, PhD will lead the core from UAF in collaboration with co-I Jane
Shelby, PhD and Program Coordinator Cheryl Wilga, PhD, both of UAA. These experienced leaders will guide
program progress in Alaska through excellent communication and transparent decision-making in coordination
with applicable committees. Three committees will implement and facilitate the effort of the statewide program:
External Advisory Committee, Steering Committee, and Management Advisory Committee. The External
Advisory Committee, composed of NIH-experienced investigators with both new and long-serving members,
will recommend the selection of the piloted research projects and the continued eligibility of investigators and
provide critical, programmatic advice to network leaders. The Steering Committee is comprised of senior
administrators from all participating institutions, PIs of other NIH IDeA programs, and health system research
advocates. It reviews EAC and network institutional membership, and provides direction, reviews processes,
and facilitates the inclusion of AK INBRE and the One Health research program into their respective
organizations. The Management Advisory Committee is unique to AK INBRE and consists of one
representative from each partner institution, each core lead, and the PI, co-I, and PC as well as the program
administrator. It meets monthly to coordinate program opportunities and investments. The AC will facilitate
achieving the goals of the INBRE cores and programs and will organize productive meetings for committees
and researchers that focus on collaboration across Alaska. External and internal evaluations will create
summative and formative processes for tracking program progress and results, identify the “whys” of program
component failure and/or success, and provide causal linkages between actions and outcomes. The evaluation
component is designed to change throughout the lifecycle of the proposed grant and will adapt to unpredicted
program modifications and needs."
10896994,"Project Summary:
Many patients suffer from chronic pain in the absence of identifiable injury. Such pains are termed “functional”
and include irritable bowel syndrome, temporomandibular joint disorder, fibromyalgia, migraine and others. For
reasons that are not understood, almost all functional pain syndromes (FPS) are female prevalent. FPS patients
experience pain-free interictal periods punctuated by attacks of pain. The frequency of attacks is predictive of
risk of chronification. Pain episodes thus produce a priming effect, establishing a state of increased vulnerability
to future attacks, likely reflecting peripheral and central sensitization. FPS patients commonly identify stress as
a key trigger of pain. Repeated stress may thus promote vulnerability and pain in a sexually dimorphic fashion.
We have developed an injury-free rodent model of FPS based on hyperalgesic priming with repeated stress.
Hyperalgesic priming produces a pain-free state of increased vulnerability that has been termed “latent
sensitization” (LS). Following induction of LS, normally subthreshold triggers can produce pain attacks, modeling
the interictal and ictal periods of FPS. We will use this model to test the novel hypothesis that repeated stress
activates kappa opioid receptor (KOR) signaling in the hypothalamus resulting in release of prolactin (PRL) and
dysregulation of prolactin receptor (PRLR) isoform expression selectively in female nociceptors. PRL signals
through homodimers of PRLR long and short (i.e., PRLR-L and PRLR-S) isoforms that respectively regulate
transcription and pain. Repeated stress down-regulates PRLR-L promoting female-selective pain through
stress-induced PRL/PRLR-S signaling. The balance of PRLR isoforms may therefore “tune” female nociceptors
to promote LS and pain from normally subthreshold stimuli.
We will use genetic and chemogenetic manipulations along with anatomical, neurochemical,
electrophysiological, pharmacological and behavioral studies in male and female mice to evaluate the role of
dorsal root ganglion (DRG) PRLR-L down-regulation and stress-related hypothalamic KOR activation as
essential mechanisms of LS and stress-related pain in females. Aim 1 will establish the effects of repeated
stress on hypothalamic KOR signaling and PRL release. Aim 2 will establish a potential causal relationship of
repeated stress or hypothalamic KOR activation on DRG PRLR isoform expression, neural excitability, LS and
stress-related pain. Aim 3 will determine if KOR antagonists, DA agonists or a PRL antibody will prevent LS and
FPS-like pain selectively in females.
The proposed studies will characterize a previously unknown stress-related neuroendocrine link between
hypothalamic KOR and PRL/PRLR signaling to promote female selective functional pain. Importantly, these
studies will advance knowledge about previously unknown biological mechanisms and may unravel mechanisms
for therapeutic interventions allowing improved therapy of FPS in women."
10816588,"Broadly HIV-neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) with extreme breadth and potency represent promising options for
HIV/AIDS treatment, functional cure and/or prevention. However, all bnAb epitope classes exhibit distinct gaps
in covering viral Env diversity in populations of people living with HIV. Consequently, prevention trials experience
unpredictably restricted efficacy. Further, treatment trials inadvertently enroll infected participants harboring
bnAb-resistant variants in plasma and/or tissue compartments. As noted in RFA-AI-22-022, such subjects have
little chance of clinical benefit, and therefore negatively skew estimates of efficacy and clinical utility. There is an
unmet need for innovative clinical assays that rapidly and prospectively detect bnAb- resistant HIV variants in
potential therapy/cure trial participants; and characterize resistance in breakthrough infections in prevention
trials. New tests must also meet the additional complexities of testing triple bnAb class combinations, which
seems imminent. Current screening approaches do not meet these needs as they are time consuming, labor
intensive, technically complex, involve pseudovirus production and testing, and require RNA or DNA sequencing
which may be unreliable, depending on the subject and sample. A promising approach toward expediting and
expanding neutralization resistance testing is based on direct, quantitative detection of antibody-target binding
within a subject’s virus population. The underlying rationale is that neutralization stems from virion binding;
resistant variants are by nature poorly (or not) immunoreactive. Thus, a certain fraction of bnAb-unbound virus
in a population will presage viral outgrowth/escape during treatment by the test bnAb. Also, bnAb-virion binding
can be rapidly and readily quantified. However, this approach demands technology with the sensitivity to quantify
bnAb-bound (sensitive) and unbound (resistant) virus fractions in plasma samples or culture fluids, with minimal
target perturbations. To date, such technology has not come forward. Our ongoing studies now show that these
demands may be met by confocal fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) techniques for detecting antibody
binding at the single virion level. Using fluorescent labeled bnAbs in FCS, we can simultaneously count, in one
multiplex assay, the numbers of virions in a sample population that are bound by one or more bnAb types or
avoid recognition altogether. Further, virions concurrently bound to multiple bnAb types can be counted by cross-
correlated signals. Our goal for this R61/R33 project is to translate this technology into a rapid, economical,
multiplex clinical test for blood or culture samples that: 1) determines the presence and proportions of virus sub-
populations in a human sample that are covered (or ignored) by one or more bnAbs in a triple class combination
and thus reliably and sensitively 2) identifies people living with HIV who harbor resistant viruses risking rebound
under bnAb treatment or 3) characterizes the nature of breakthrough infections in prevention trials. The impact
of this project will be to advance bnAb resistance detection capacities to support numerous bnAb clinical trial
activities, from screening volunteers to tailoring subject-specific bnAb combinations for treatment or cure."
10827984,"Type 2 Diabetes is a leading cause of blindness in working-aged Americans. Vision loss comes from diabetic
eye disease which includes diabetic retinopathy and edema. Diabetic eye disease can appear at any retinal
location and damages both the inner and outer retina. There are no treatments outside of glycemic control for
early diabetic eye disease. Methods for early diagnosis and detection, especially if location-specific, are
important as they can help doctors and patients to be proactive in delaying retinopathy and vision loss. Current
clinical tests such as multifocal electroretinograms (mfERG), ocular coherence tomography (OCT), and color
vision assessment have been widely shown to be altered in early diabetes. However, there has been little work
to characterize localized color vision deficiencies across the diabetic retina, and it remains unclear exactly
which cells are implicated in color vision losses. To address these gaps, the proposed research will test
patients using a custom chromatic microperimeter to precisely quantify color discrimination across the visual
field. In Aim 1, color thresholds from patients with diabetes and prediabetes will be shown to differ from
normally sighted control subjects, with the degree of impairment and variation in testing correlated with HbA1c
levels. In addition to expected reductions in the blue-yellow pathway, it is hypothesized that the red-green
pathway will show a deficiency as well, addressing the controversy concerning whether S-cone loss alone
underlies the color vision deficits in diabetes. In Aim 2, additional co-registered structural and functional
measures from mfERG, OCT, and fundus photography will reveal that spatially localized losses are associated
with regions of damage, laying the foundation for future longitudinal studies aimed at the early detection of
affected regions in diabetes and prediabetes. The ability to predict which areas are most affected could
constitute a significant advance in diagnosis and management of this disease and potentially create new end
points for future studies and trials. Diabetes has reached epidemic proportions in the US and worldwide and
better understanding the effects of the disease could lead to improvements in the lives of these patients."
10854960,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Endometriosis is an inflammatory disease affecting the peritoneal cavity that has been treated predominantly
with endocrine modulators to impose growth restriction through suppression of estrogen action. Worldwide,
there are 28 development or marketed products that address the endocrine axis of endometriosis. However,
few, if any drug discovery efforts address the non-hormonal axes of this disease as stand-alone therapy, or as
sequential therapy during hiatus from endocrine-suppressing agents. The pathophysiology shared by deep
infiltrating endometriosis, superficial peritoneal endometriosis and ovarian endometrioma includes epithelial-
mesenchymal trans-differentiation (EMT) and fibroblast-myofibrobocyte trans-differentiation. The focus of this
proposed research is to develop novel, potent, highly selective inhibitors of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK-I) that
can interrupt trans-differentiation pathways that are the pathological basis for lesion survival.
Our preliminary results with bentamipimod (JNK-I) have validated this approach demonstrating equivalent
regression of lesions as were obtained with GnRH antagonist in primate models. Furthermore, results in
rodent, non-human primate models, and in humans (Phase II results) demonstrate regression of lesions
without impact on eutopic endometrium, or endogenous hormone levels. Our project integrates reproductive
biologists, immunologists, medicinal chemists and biomedical engineers with demonstrated leadership in
academic and pharmaceutical research to discover novel JNK-I and characterize their potential for patients.
Our program incorporates state-of-the-art technologies to help achieve our objectives. In Specific Aim 1, we
will optimize affinity and permeability of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK-I) obtained following two rounds of
selection from our DNA-encoded Chemistry Technology (DEC-Tec) libraries at Baylor College of Medicine
containing over 4 billion compounds. The efficacy of these compounds in vitro will be evaluated in established
cell lines and in primary human endometrial stromal cells. In Specific Aim 2, we will compare the efficacy of
novel JNK-I prepared at the Center for Drug Discovery to tanzisertib in a previously validated mouse
model of endometriosis with endometrium-specific ER? overexpression (ER?:OE) that enables
evaluation of anti-inflammatory therapies amidst elevated ER? response and compromised progesterone
sensitivity. These comparisons have never been generated for JNK-I and provide an opportunity to assess
treatment efficacy based on improved potency of JNK-I. In Specific Aim 3, we will demonstrate that
emerging diagnostics of the menstrualome can stratify patients for future JNK-I therapy based on their
ex vivo cytokine production from macrophages and NK cells obtained from menstrual effluent. The
objectives for all three Specific Aims generate new information regarding the action of JNK-I in endometriosis
for both known and novel JNK-I."
10881959,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alcohol and other drug use inequities have had devastating impacts for many American Indian/First
Nations (Indigenous) communities and families. Social Determinants of Health (SDH) are critical
mechanisms of risk and resilience for substance abuse (SA), substance use disorders (SUD), and recovery
from SUD. This project will move beyond “risk-factor” epidemiology that largely ignores heterogeneity of SU
patterns and impacts of SDH and has failed to materialize into substantial changes in population health
outcomes. We will focus on identifying what matters most and to whom by examining relative impacts of SDH
for SA over the life-course and across generations of Indigenous families.
This competitive renewal application builds on our existing community-based participatory research with 8
tribal communities. We propose to continue computer-assisted survey interviews with existing Healing
Pathways “target participants” (baseline N = 735) for whom we already have 11 waves of developmental data
spanning childhood and early adulthood. We will enroll their own children in the study for multiple generations
of epidemiological information on SA, SUD, recovery and resilience. We will also collect qualitative information
to capture nuanced community perspectives on the contexts and mechanisms of substance use.
Results of this research will increase awareness of the nature, etiology, and consequences of
alcohol and other drug use problems and recovery in Indigenous reservation/reserve communities.
Another outcome is enhanced precision in identifying SDH related to substance use and positive
Indigenous development. Thus, the results of this project have potential to optimize the timing of
and targets of intervention and prevention programs and policies in Indigenous communities."
10916339,"Background: Guidelines recommend adults should engage in moderate exercise, such as walking, for at least
150 minutes per week in episodes of at least 10 minutes duration. A typical adult can reach this threshold by
walking 7,000 steps per day. Unfortunately, only 5% of adults in the United States meet these requirements,
and more than 1 in 3 Veterans over age 45 meet the definition of physically inactive. A patient incentive
program for physical activity (PA) may help. Behavioral economics suggests that our chronic inability to start
and maintain a PA routine may be the result of “present bias,” which is a tendency to value small immediate
rewards over large rewards in the distant future. For many people, the immediate gratification of a sedentary
activity, such as watching television or surfing the internet, is a more powerful motivator than the intangible
satisfaction of a physically active lifestyle. Patient incentives may overcome present bias by moving the
rewards for healthy behaviors forward in time. In a patient incentive program, patients are given tangible, timely
rewards for achieving specific health goals, such as walking 7,000 steps per day.
Significance/Impact: Regular physical activity (PA) is associated with reduced mortality and lower risks of
many diseases, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and depression. this study addresses the chronic
conditions HSR&D priority area.
Innovation: There is little evidence on what type of incentive works best for Veterans. We propose to study
incentives for PA in a novel form of randomized trial—A Multiphase Optimization STrategy (MOST) trial. Our
objectives are to determine the optimal design of a 12-week patient incentive program to encourage walking
among physically inactive Veterans age 50-70. The primary outcomes are optimized components of the
intervention, which will be tested against a usual care control group in a future, separate randomized trial.
Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Conduct a 24 factorial designed screening-phase trial of incentives for increasing average steps
per day to 7,000 steps over 12 weeks among physically inactive Veterans. We will test four different
incentive factors: 1) lottery vs. loss framed incentives, 2) financial vs. non-financial incentives, 3) a pre-
commitment postcard reminder of a Veteran’s stated intrinsic reason for commitment to PA vs. no pre-
commitment postcard, and 4) a request for PA advice from a Veteran on staying active vs. no request. The
primary outcome is change in steps per week from baseline to week 24.
Aim 2. Conduct cost analyses and qualitative interviews. The cost of administering each component and
qualitative assessments of the acceptability of each component to trial participants will inform the decision of
which components to retain for the subsequent refining and confirmatory phase trials.
Aim 3. Convene an expert panel to choose components for the next phases of the MOST trial. The panel
will weigh each component in terms of its effect on step counts (Aim 1), administrative costs and participant-
reported qualitative assessments (Aim 2), and the strength of the theoretical basis for the component’s effect
on physical activity.
Methodology: We will enroll physically inactive Veterans age 50-70 in the screening phase trial. The
intervention is the four different incentive factors described above. The primary outcome is change in steps per
week from baseline to week 24.
Implementation/Next Steps: The components derived from this screening phase will be used in a refining
phase trial that establishes the optimal dose (frequency, duration, and amount) of the incentive. The optimized
intervention will then be tested against a usual care control group in the confirming phase trial. The refining and
confirming phase trials will be proposed in a separate, future grant submission."
10828428,"Summary
Parkinson`s disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the nigrostriatal
region which starts 4-7 years before symptoms such as movement disturbances become manifest. Diagnosis of
the disease in the asymptomatic phase is ideal, as it would enable earlier treatment and provide new targets for
therapeutic intervention. We have developed a highly specific agonist, MCL-524, for the active form of the
dopamine receptor, D2high, which is up-regulated in early PD. This early, transient upregulation is an opportunity
to use it as a biomarker. We aim to characterize MCL-524 in a moderate animal model of pre-symptomatic PD.
In this model, by injection of 6-OHDA into three discrete sites in the striatum, a progressive but incomplete loss
of DA neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway is induced, which resembles early stages of PD.
In our first specific aim, we will use [3H]MCL-524 to detect the up-regulation of the D2high receptor in 6-OHDA rats
compared with sham operated controls. D2 receptor binding will be evaluated through quantitative
autoradiography.
In the second aim, we will confirm specificity of MCL-524 by intravenous pre-treatment with a specific D2 receptor
antagonist, N-(methyl) benperidol, which should abolish all binding of [3H]MCL-524 to D2; or a specific D3 receptor
antagonist, SB277011A, which should not interfere with binding of MCL-524 to D2high.
Completion of these aims will:
a) validate MCL-524 as a highly selective and specific agonist ligand which can unambiguously detect early, key
changes to D2 receptor expression and function; and
b) allow for development of a robust protocol for diagnosing Parkinson’s disease in the prodromal stage.
The overarching goal is to develop MCL-524 as a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for early
clinical diagnosis of PD. Early detection of this neurodegenerative disease will allow for earlier and better
treatment opportunities for the patient, and will help alleviate the socio-economic burden for PD patients and
their families."
10873913,"The enteric nervous system (ENS), the largest portion of the peripheral nervous system, is derived from
neural crest populations referred to as “vagal” and “sacral”, arising from the neck and tail regions, respectively.
However, much less has been published about sacral than vagal neural crest. To rectify this knowledge gap,
we propose to: 1. characterize the temporal sequence of migration and differentiation of sacral neural
crest cells into neuronal subtypes in the hindgut; 2. transcriptionally profile the sacral neural crest as at
multiple time points and compare with that of vagal neural crest; 3. test function of transcription factors
that may drive sacral neural crest cell fate choice. The results will enable us to test whether vagal and sacral
neural crest cells give rise to similar or distinct types of enteric neurons and elucidate the influence of the
intestinal environment on their differentiation. We will characterize the chick sacral neural crest using a novel
lineage labeling technique of Replication Incompetent Avian (RIA) retroviruses that enables us to specifically
target and isolate by FACS the sacral neural crest-derived population to perform the following aims:
Specific Aim 1: Retrovirus-mediated lineage analysis of the chick sacral compared with vagal neural
crest: We will label the neural tube caudal to somite 27 with RIA retroviruses that permanently label sacral neural
crest cells in order to follow their long term fate. Preliminary results suggest that sacral neural crest-derived cells
populate the post-umbilical gut and differentiate into cholinergic motor neurons as well as tyrosine hydroxylase
positive cells. Sacral neural crest will be compared with vagal neural crest and interactions between the two
populations examined. Finally, clonal relationships between sacral crest cells will be characterized.
Specific Aim 2: Single cell RNA-seq of sacral neural crest-derived cells in the post-umbilical gut. To
elucidate gene regulatory programs controlling progressive differentiation of sacral neural crest cells into neurons
and glia in the hindgut, we propose to characterize the transcriptional profile of sacral crest-derived cells FACS
sorted from the post-umbilical gut and processed by single cell (sc) RNA-seq at embryonic days (E) 2.5, E6, E8,
10, 15, 21 (prehatching); these will be compared with vagal crest-derived cells at comparable stages. Preliminary
scRNA-seq data on E10 suggest that there are differences in neuronal subtypes produced by sacral vs vagal
crest. scRNA-seq will enable us to sample different neuronal subtypes and infer developmental trajectories.
Specific Aim 3: Role of transcriptional regulators into differentiation of sacral neural crest into neuronal
and glial subtypes. Focusing on transcription factors that are present in the enteric precursor cluster (e.g.
Nfatc1, Foxn2, Sox4, Sox21, Elf2, Znf536), we will test whether sacral neural crest-enriched transcription factors
are critical for mediating proliferation, migration within the gut, and/or cell fate decisions. To this end, we will
perform targeted loss of function in the sacral neural crest using a single-plasmid CRISPR-Cas9 strategy and
examine subsequent effects on distribution and/or differentiation of sacral neural crest-derived cells."
11143990,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Growing evidence suggests the presence of dysregulated pain modulation in older adults, and affect which
may heighten age-associated risk for chronic pain. Additionally, chronic pain and Alzheimer’s Disease and
related dementias (AD/ADRD) are highly prevalent and comorbid in older adults, and research suggests that
they may have overlapping etiologies and pathologies. Chronic pain may a predictor for the development of
AD, and almost half of AD patients report having pain. Thus, understanding of the shared mechanisms
underlying both is critical in order to develop effective treatment and prevention modalities. Recently,
epigenetics has been implicated in both disease states, with many modifications of the epigenome that may go
on to result in immune system dysfunction, of which is a hallmark of both chronic pain and AD. While there are
many environmental factors that can influence the epigenome, nutrition status has been shown to be one of
the most common and modifiable factors therein. Thus, it may be efficacious to understand dietary interactions
with the epigenome to target epigenetic regulation of the development and maintenance of chronic pain and
AD. Therefore, the overall goal for this mentored career development proposal (K99/R00) is to fill this
knowledge gap and determine the influence of overall diet pattern as well as Vitamins A and D specifically on
the epigenetic environment as it relates to chronic pain and AD/ADRD. Primary training goals for the current
proposal are to: Increase knowledge and understanding of measurement techniques used to assess cognitive
aging in humans, with a specific focus on mild cognitive impairment, and AD/ADRD; Further expand
knowledge of nutri-epigenetics, and apply it to cognitive aging outcomes; Enhance clinical research skills
related to the design, conduct and statistical analysis of multidisciplinary studies and rigorous translational
research skills to function as an independent investigator. Study 1 (K99 Phase) will assess dietary differences
and their associations with differences in epigenetic aging, pain, and cognition in individuals with and without
chronic pain. Study 2 (R00 phase) will allow for the assessment of diet pattern as well as vitamin A and D
status on DNA methylation patterns, gene and protein expression, pain and cognitive outcomes in older adults
with and without mild cognitive impairment. This proposed career development plan extends from the PIs prior
work in dietary and immune system modulation of pain, and will forge a path towards understanding and
investigating side-effect free nutrigenomic targets that improve pain and AD/ADRD outcomes in older adults."
10898086,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – BIOMARKERS PROJECT
Accurate dietary assessments are a major challenge in nutritional research, especially among free-living
individuals. In contrast to self-reported dietary assessments, dietary biomarkers are more objective and less
prone to reporting errors. However, traditional dietary biomarker discovery methods are rate-limiting and rely
on prior knowledge of food composition. Advances in metabolomic profiling techniques, coupled with feeding
trials, now pave the road for discovering novel food biomarkers more efficiently, although the list of sensitive
and specific food biomarkers is still short. In response to the RFA-DK-20-005, this proposal, which is specific
for the Biomarkers Project (BP) Core, will focus on the characterization of pharmacokinetics of novel food
biomarkers and validation of food biomarkers in both clinical feeding trial and observational study settings in
multiple independent populations. Specifically, at Phase 1, based on data and resources to be generated at the
Intervention Core, we will calculate half-lives of novel food biomarkers, estimate other pharmacokinetics
features of the markers, and establish calibration curves and functions for computing food intake. At Phase 2,
we will evaluate changes of food biomarkers following 6-week dietary interventions (DASH-style high-
carbohydrate diet, high plant protein diet, and high unsaturated fat diet) implemented in the OmniHeart feeding
trial. We will further use multiple markers to construct a diet quality score and examine the effects of the
interventions on the score. At Phase 3, we will validate the food biomarkers using dietary data assessed by the
gold-standard 7-day diet records and other validated tools in the Lifestyle Validation Study (LVS) and Study of
Latinos Nutrition & Physical Activity Assessment Study (SOLNAS). We will further build measurement error
correction equations based on the calibration curves and explore inter-relationships between diet, microbiome,
and food biomarkers. These proposed projects at the BP Core will significantly accelerate the advances in food
biomarker discovery and validation in U.S. populations. In addition, the overall complementary, inter-connected
projects proposed for the Harvard Dietary Biomarker Development Center will be led by a highly experienced
investigator team consisting of researchers with expertise in feeding trials, metabolomics, bioinformatics,
nutritional biomarker research, and nutritional epidemiology. The interdisciplinary expertise and rich, existing
resources of multi-ethnic cohorts in the U.S. will lead to significant scientific yields in a cost-effective manner.
Data to be generated from the BP Core will not only characterize and validate novel food markers but also
build the foundation for applying the food biomarkers in a broad range of research settings, such as evaluation
of diet-disease associations or monitoring of dietary compliance. As such, the proposed research has a great
potential to advance dietary assessment methodology and to aid in future research toward the development of
precision or individualized nutrition strategies for chronic disease prevention and management."

The goal of the Administration Core is to ensure that the Projects are able to achieve their scientific and
dissemination objectives while in parallel foster synergy and overseeing interactions between the Projects to
ensure effective and coherent operation. Our central scientific and organizational leadership will rest with the
Internal Advisory Committee (IAC). The Team Director (TD) Anna Devor will oversee IAC, provide overall
scientific leadership and guidance, manage the sharing and dissemination efforts, and be assisted on a daily
basis by administrative assistant (AA) Parya Farzam to achieve the goal of the Administration Core. For grants
management including financials, progress reporting, and purchasing, the U19 team will work with their
existing respective infrastructure at Boston University (BU), University of California San Diego (UCSD),
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). This allows the Administration
Core to focus on the administrative tasks specific to research activities of this U19.
The Core, physically located at BU (the applicant institution), will implement the governance plan, put forward
by the IAC and offer any course corrections to IAC if needed. In addition, we will establish a to-be-named
External Advisory Board to be convened annually to assess progress and accomplishments, and to provide
guidance and direction to the team (IAC). The TD and the AA will prepare the annual progress report, maintain
a list of publications, presentations, other research products, and intellectual property that have resulted from
this U19 funding. The Core will evaluate and maintain all materials transfer agreements and other legal
agreements and activities related to sharing and dissemination that arise during the course of this program.
The Core will maintain the IACUC and IRB approvals for the U19, including updating approvals and continuing
review documents from the subcontract institution.
Our sharing and dissemination plan is extensively described within the Data Science Core. The lead of the
Data Science Core Dr. Freund will have primary responsibility over these operations and will be assisted by the

10870055,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 1
 We propose to leverage our state-of-the-art expertise in vivo optical imaging and data analysis, combined
with behavioral training, electrophysiology, and modeling, to investigate fundamental aspects of the pial
neurovascular circuit in mice. This circuit is composed of a fully connected albeit irregular lattice of pial
arterioles that undergo rhythmic oscillations - in the ~ 0.1 Hz vasomotor band - in isolation. The pial circuit
integrates neuronal activity from neighboring vessels, underlying neurons, and subcortical regions to produce
dynamic patterns of coherent oscillations in arteriolar diameter across the cortical mantel. These patterns
contain regions at slightly different frequencies, i.e., they parcellate, in a manner that partially reflects the
underlying neuronal input. We seek to understand and model this parcellation, which is readily measured with
optical and functional MR imaging, and quantify how it defines brain state.
 Aim 1 seeks to formulate an understanding of fundamental physiology of the pial neurovascular circuit. This
includes testing if brain arterioles truly act as non-linear interacting oscillators, so that they entrain and phase
lock rather than passively filter. In Aim 2 we explore the competitive conditions that break locking between
oscillators so that parcellation can occur. These experiments gain from our ability to use sensory stimuli from
different modalities - touch, vision and audition - each of which targets a different brain area. They also gain
from our ability to drive subcortical inputs, particularly those involved in homeostatic brain function, and use
direct optogenetic stimulation where needed. Lastly, these experiments gain from interaction with the
neuromodulatory investigations of Project 2, as subcortical neuromodulation provides both regional and
cortex-wide control of neuronal excitability.
 The experimental plan is motivated by the theory of phase-coupled oscillators that dates from Yoshiki
Kuramoto's 1975 Lecture Notes. In this regard, progress on Aims 1 and 2 are strongly interwoven with the
theory effort of Project 4.
 Aim 3 will connect the dynamics of the pial neurovascular circuit with the dynamics of the penetrating
arterioles; these vessels source energy substrates to the parenchyma. These experiments, also in rodents,
involve deep imaging of the cerebral mantel with CBV fMRI and adaptive optics two photon imaging. Together
with direct measurements of oxygen transport in Project 2, these data provide input for calculations of oxygen
tension throughout the cortical mantle. This, in turn, provides a means to couple BOLD fMRI and/or CBV fMRI
to pial neurovascular dynamics.
 All told, the experimentation and analysis of Project 1 will provide a way forward to infer the state of the
human mind from MR imaging (Project 3)."
10870058,"Abstract
We propose to investigate the role of neuromodulation in the phenomenon of “whole-cortex” activity of
the pial neurovascular circuit. This circuit is composed of a network of pial arterioles that integrate neuronal
activity with the intrinsic arteriolar vasomotion producing dynamic patterns of coherent oscillations in the
arteriolar diameter effectively parcellating the cortical mantle.
Prior research suggests that ascending neuromodulatory systems may work in parallel affecting the brain state
and processing capacity of large-scale cortical networks. In the majority of these studies, however, the
presence of neuromodulatory neurotransmitters in the cortex was not directly measured. Rather, their release
was inferred from stimulation of the corresponding subcortical nuclei or indirect measures. To overcome this
limitation, in the proposed project we will use direct, selective and sensitive optical probes for
acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin and track the presence of these neurotransmitters
in space and time across the cortical mantle in awake behaving mice. We will combine these probes with
optical imaging of neuronal Ca2+, blood oxygenation, optically transparent electrode arrays, optogenetic
manipulations and BOLD fMRI. Using these tools, including those pioneered by the members of our team, we
will address the role of neuromodulation in generation of (i) large-scale spontaneous cortical neuronal activity
observed with wide-field Ca2+ imaging, (ii) temporally coherent patterns of vasomotion in the pial neurovascular
circuit, and (iii) the resultant spatiotemporal pattern of hemodynamic fluctuations. Further, we ask whether
these spatiotemporal patterns of vasomotion and hemodynamics, which can be measured noninvasively, can
be used to infer the underlying internal brain state and/or activity of specific neuromodulatory systems.
We will collaborate with Project 1 to understand the rules of integration of the neuromodulatory drive with local
neuronal activity and intrinsic oscillatory dynamics within the pial neurovascular circuit. We will also collaborate
with Project 3 to ensure that our findings translate up the scale from mice to humans. A critical link to Project
3 will be simultaneous optical/fMRI studies in awake mice. Finally, we will work with Project 4 to devise a
phenomenological mathematical model that captures the essence of a brain state from the standpoint of the
vascular integrator producing large-scale patterns of coherent vascular/hemodynamic fluctuations.
This Project will provide a novel, unprecedented view on the role of neuromodulation in orchestrating large-
scale spontaneous neuronal and hemodynamic activity, explore the underlying mechanisms, and offer a strong
physiological foundation for the interpretation of large-scale fMRI signals and better understanding of the
mechanisms linking spontaneous neuronal activity to cognitive performance. In collaboration with other
Projects, we will deliver a predictive, conceptual model of local and global control of the pial
neurovascular circuit and inference of brain states and specific neuromodulatory circuits in humans."
10870061,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 3
We propose to leverage our state-of-the-art functional MRI (fMRI) tools combined with electroencephalography
(EEG) to investigate the pial neurovascular circuit in humans. This circuit is composed of a network of pial
arterioles that integrate neuronal activity with the intrinsic arteriolar vasomotion, producing dynamic patterns of
coherent oscillations in arteriolar diameter that effectively parcellate the cortical mantle.
Today fMRI is the most widespread tool for measuring neural activity noninvasively across the entire human
brain. All fMRI signals are vascular in origin, thus proper interpretation of these hemodynamic signals is key to
understanding the underlying neural activity. Our team has demonstrated that spontaneous oscillations in arterial
vascular diameter, or vasomotion, in the cerebral cortex is entrained by local neural activity, and that arterioles
behave as coupled oscillators with other connected arterioles via active signaling along the vascular
endothelium. This motivates the central hypothesis of this U19—that local neuronal drive and neuromodulatory
inputs with ultralow-frequency components compete with the intrinsic oscillatory properties of arterioles. This
allows different cortical regions to oscillate at different frequencies and results in spatial parcellation of
vasodynamics and the formation of different constellations of temporally coherent regions. The coupling of
arterial oscillations will induce coupling of the downstream venous blood oxygenation that is the basis of Blood-
Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast, the most commonly used fMRI signal.
 In Aim 1, we will adapt our noninvasive imaging tools to image the anatomy and dynamics of the human pial
arterial vascular network. We will then develop novel tools to measure diameter changes of pial arterioles to
directly track vasomotion in humans, and link these dynamics to standard fMRI measures. Our Aim 2 is a human
counterpart of Project 1; we will study vascular integration of multiple sensory drives by the pial neurovascular
circuit and its reflection in large-scale hemodynamics. Our Aim 3 is the human counterpart of Project 2; we will
record BOLD fMRI and EEG simultaneously during spontaneous fluctuations in arousal state, and identify how
internal brain states are linked to spatial patterns of our imaging readouts. Similar to Project 2, we will test
whether these hemodynamic patterns, alone or in combination with EEG signals, can be used to predict cognitive
performance. Finally, we will work throughout with Project 4 to devise a phenomenological mathematical model
that captures the essence of a brain state from the standpoint of the vascular integrator producing large-scale
patterns of coherent vascular/hemodynamic fluctuations. Impact: Project 3 will offer a strong physiological
foundation for the interpretation of large-scale fMRI signals in humans and better understanding of the
mechanisms linking spontaneous neurovascular activity to cognitive performance. Overall, our program will
establish an inverse link between human fMRI observables and the underlying internal brain state, potentially
including inference of neuromodulatory dynamics from noninvasive measurements."

across the county, particularly those that historically have had limited data from diverse groups (e.g.,
neuroimaging, genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics). The Core will 1) continue to recruit,
enroll, and perform annual clinical evaluations that are harmonized with the Religious Orders Study and Latino

The goal of this proposal is to generate and characterize a round spermatid-specific Cre deleter mouse line.
Currently, there is no Cre-deleter mouse line available that targets deletion of a floxed gene specifically in
round spermatids. The available testis germ cell Cre-lines delete floxed genes either in spermatogonia (Stra8-
iCre) or in spermatocytes (Spo11-Cre, Hsp2a-Cre). These lines are not suitable for studying the biology of
round spermatids because their use would cause a phenotype prior to the formation of haploid cells. We will
generate a transgenic mouse line in which the well-characterized round spermatid-specific promoter of the
mouse Acrv1 gene will drive the expression of Cre recombinase. Accomplishment of this project goal will
provide a novel mouse line that will enable researchers to assess the function of ubiquitously expressed
genes during round spermatid differentiation (spermiogenesis). Using this novel Cre-line (Acrv1-Cre), we
propose to test the hypothesis that the ubiquitously expressed TAR DNA/RNA binding protein of 43
kilodaltons (TDP-43) is essential for spermiogenesis. Our previous work has established that TDP-43 is
critical for male fertility. TDP-43 is expressed in the round spermatids as well as in the manchette of step 9-11
spermatids. The Acrv1-Cre mouse will allow us to test its role during spermiogenesis. Thus, the innovative
part is that this proposal accomplishes two goals simultaneously. This proposal fulfils the stated purpose of
the funding opportunity PA-20-200. It will develop new research technology (round spermatid-specific Cre

significant disease globally. The rise of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern has highlighted the need to understand
the viral genetic determinants underlying disease severity, transmission potential, and ability to evade immunity,
which requires molecular tools to make viral mutants. However, current approaches to constructing and
manipulating viral infectious clones rely on a living host (bacteria or yeast), which can lead to unwanted mutations
and deletions in the viral genome, especially for larger viruses like coronaviruses and flaviviruses. Due to these
issues, few labs can successfully perform this work. Since the host causes these unwanted mutations, a strategy
that removes the need for a living host represents the best way forward.
Our long-term goal is to create simple-to-use tools that facilitate fundamental virology research aimed at
reducing disease burden, in line with NIH’s mission. This project aims to develop and optimize a paradigm-
shifting but straightforward host-free approach for constructing and manipulating viral infectious clones,
facilitating studies seeking to identify viral genetic determinants of disease, transmission, and other phenotypes.
This approach can also be used to construct recombinant vaccine viruses and diagnostic tools like reporter
viruses. We will use an exciting technique—replication cycle reaction (RCR)—which reconstitutes the E. coli
DNA replication machinery in a tube. RCR can efficiently amplify a single DNA molecule of up to 1 Mb with high
fidelity in a simple-to-use format. Here, we propose developing this RCR-based system to construct new
infectious clones (Aim 1) and manipulate existing ones (Aim 2). Aim 1 will use chemically synthesized DNA to
create infectious clones for the rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant and DENV strain Puo-218, a
component of the approved DENV vaccine, Dengvaxia. The impact of this aim will be an innovative system to
generate new infectious clones. Aim 2 will use the RCR-based system to make mutations and deletions in the
SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in an existing infectious clone; we will then study the impact these mutations have
on viral replication in primary human cells. The impact of this aim will be a straightforward method to generate
viral mutants, facilitating mechanistic studies to understand the viral genetic determinants of pathogenesis,
transmission, and immune evasion. These studies will also identify mutations outside Spike that impact viral
replication. We expect these studies will have a sustained impact on molecular virology by empowering more
labs to construct and manipulate infectious clones. We anticipate the techniques generated here to be broadly
applicable to other positive-sense RNA viruses and negative-sense RNA and DNA viruses as well. Finally, we
will share all the methods and tools generated here openly and without restriction."
10906167,"ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this five year R33 grant proposal, “Geriatric Oncology Research Infrastructure to Improve
Clinical Care,” submitted on behalf of the Cancer and Aging Research Group (CARG; mycarg.org), is to
further expand CARG’s national research infrastructure to support innovative investigators, leaders,
and projects to answer significant interdisciplinary research questions at the aging and cancer
interface. This proposal, in response to PAR 20-071, supports “advanced-stage development and utilization of
novel research infrastructure to advance the science of aging in specific areas requiring interdisciplinary
partnerships or collaborations.” Even after creating a robust aging and cancer research infrastructure
over the last five years through the R21/33 mechanism, there remains substantial unmet need to
expand this infrastructure to develop high-impact research at the aging and cancer interface. The
overall goal remains to significantly and rapidly improve the lives of older adults with cancer through
scholarship and leadership by expanding CARG’s impact. With the support of the R21/33 mechanism, the
multiple Principal Investigators (MPI: Dale, Mohile, Hurria/Klepin) completed a coordinated, broad-based
strategy to infuse aging principles into oncology research. Through the original grant’s Aims, CARG has
become a recognized international leader for mentorship and scholarship in aging and cancer. CARG is a
coalition of aging and cancer scholars dedicated to: 1) connecting interdisciplinary investigators together; 2)
designing, implementing, and disseminating aging and cancer research; 3) mentoring new interdisciplinary
investigators in the field; and 4) disseminating and advocating for equitable research and care for older adults.
In exceeding the aims of the R21/R33 award, CARG successfully transitioned from infrastructure development
(R21) to establishment (R33), centering around six Cores and a Leadership Team. This R33 renewal is
sought to expand CARG’s impact through the following Aims: 1) Expand the reach of the infrastructure,
using the Cores, to facilitate the design and rigor of CARG’s aging and cancer research; 2) Facilitate high-priority,
impactful research at the interface of aging and cancer through pilot awards and the conduct of large, competitive
multi-site studies; 3) Identify, cultivate, and mentor CARG investigators for leadership in aging and cancer research
to develop the next generation of leaders in the field; 4) Build greater capacity for engagement with older patients
with cancer and caregivers through CARG’s patient advocacy group (SCOREboard) to further grow patient-centered
aging and cancer research; and 5) Develop and disseminate geriatric oncology-specific content including best
clinical practices, research findings, and opportunities for collaboration and advocacy through a robust
communication strategy. Ultimately, the proposed activities will substantially expand CARG’s infrastructure to
advance high-impact research aimed at improving the care of older adults with cancer globally."
10814401,"Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, are among the most efficacious and broad-spectrum oral
antibacterials in clinical use. The World Health Organization lists them in their five “Highest Priority Critically
Important Antimicrobials,” and these drugs are the most heavily prescribed antibacterials worldwide.
 The cellular targets of fluoroquinolones are the bacterial type II topoisomerases, gyrase and topoisomerase IV.
These essential enzymes regulate DNA under- and overwinding and remove knots and tangles from the genome
by generating transient double-stranded breaks in the genetic material. Fluoroquinolones act by increasing levels
of double-stranded DNA breaks generated by gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which converts these enzymes into
cellular toxins that fragment the genome. Although gyrase and topoisomerase IV are both physiological targets
for fluoroquinolones, their relative importance to drug action appears to be species- and drug-dependent.
 There is a growing crisis in antibacterial resistance and fluoroquinolone resistance is becoming prevalent. This
resistance is threatening the clinical efficacy of fluoroquinolones. Initial fluoroquinolone resistance is most often
associated with specific mutations in gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV that occur at a serine residue (originally
described as Ser83 in the GyrA subunit of Escherichia coli gyrase) and a glutamic/aspartic acid residue 4 amino
acids downstream. Based on a published structure and functional studies from the Osheroff laboratory, these
residues are proposed to anchor a water-metal ion bridge that serves as the primary conduit between fluoro-
quinolones and gyrase/topoisomerase IV.
 The identification and characterization of novel agents that act against these well-validated enzyme targets
and overcome fluoroquinolone resistance could have important health ramifications. Recently, two new classes
of gyrase/topoisomerase IV-targeted agents have been described that appear to overcome this resistance, Novel
Bacterial Topoisomerase Inhibitors (NBTIs) and Spiropyrimidinetriones (SPTs). Members of these classes,
gepotidacin (NBTI) and zoliflodacin (SPT), have advanced to Phase 3 clinical trials. NBTIs are unique, as they
induce single- rather than double-stranded enzyme-generated DNA breaks. However, little is known about the
actions of NBTIs and SPTs against gyrase/topoisomerase IV or the mechanism of drug resistance.
 There is an urgent need to identify drugs that display activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria. Thus,
the goals of this project are to further define the mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones, NBTIs, and SPTs against
gyrase and topoisomerase IV in vivo and in cells, to characterize the basis of target-mediated drug resistance,
and to identify novel compounds that overcome resistance. Research will benefit from the broad library of wild-
type and drug-resistant gyrase/topoisomerase IV available in the Osheroff laboratory, which includes enzymes
from Bacillus anthracis, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae,
Francisella tularensis, and Acinetobacter baumannii. These pathogens have substantial effects on human health."
10900762,"Quality sleep is imperative for the maintenance of good health. There is a growing recognition of sex
disparities in sleep and rhythm disorders. Complaints such as insufficient sleep and insomnia are ~40% more
prevalent in women than men. Yet, historically, women and female animals are underrepresented in studies of
sleep and its disorders. While gonadal steroids and gender are implicated as risk factors for sleep disruptions
and insomnia, the relationship between ovarian steroids and sleep is poorly understood. The broad, long-term
objective of the application is to understand the cellular mechanisms and functional consequences of estrogen-
mediated changes in vigilance states. Findings from the previous grant have established that estradiol (E2) acting
in the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) is necessary and sufficient to reduce total sleep by ~50% of baseline in
females. However, our data present an intriguing paradox: E2 suppresses sleep while markedly increasing
extracellular adenosine, a potent inducer of sleep in the MnPO. Recent findings and preliminary data have begun
to shed light on this apparent contradiction. Our findings in the MnPO show that (1) E2 blocks the sleep inducing
actions of adenosine A2A receptor activation and activation of the adenosine A1 receptors or chemogenetic
activation of MnPO astrocytes mimic E2 suppression of sleep. Together, these findings have led us to our central
hypothesis that the E2-induced high levels of extracellular adenosine initiate a shift in adenosinergic balance from
an A2A excitatory tone that activates MnPO sleep neurons to an A1R inhibitory tone that inhibits the sleep-neurons
and E2 stimulation of MnPO astrocytes is responsible the increase in adenosine.
 We propose four independent, but related aims to address the following gaps in our knowledge that are
critical to understanding the mechanisms underlying estrogenic regulation of sleep: (1) Is the increase in MnPO
extracellular adenosine required for E2-induced suppression of sleep? (2) Is the activation of MnPO adenosine A1
receptors required for E2-induced suppression of sleep? (3) Is the suppression of MnPO adenosine A2A receptors
required for E2-induced suppression of sleep? and (4) Is E2 stimulation of MnPO astrocytes required for increases
in adenosine and sleep suppression? We approach these questions through a combination of modern
neuroscience techniques that include a GAD1-Cre transgenic rat line, fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) of
adenosine, fiber photometry and chemogenetics to investigate estrogenic regulation of sleep.
 There is heuristic value in comparing and contrasting cellular mechanisms between the sexes as this
approach has frequently reveal novel and previously unknown mechanisms of neural plasticity. Thus, we have
included a comparison of sex as a biological factor in addition to estrogenic influences on sleep mechanisms.
The significance of advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying E2 modulation of sleep is the
potential to uncover new perspectives on the root causes of sleep disturbances. Such understanding will provide
valuable insights that lead to better therapeutics benefiting both sexes."
10877839,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Brain development occurs at a rapid pace prenatally and throughout childhood, impacted by dynamic genetic
and environmental influences. Studies using advanced neuroimaging have provided significant insights into
brain development but have been limited by small sample size, especially for high-risk populations. Substance-
exposed infants are at particularly high risk for adverse outcomes; however, findings are inconsistent, making it
difficult to disentangle prenatal exposure effects from other adverse influences. The objectives of our HEALthy
Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Prenatal Experiences and Longitudinal Development (PRELUDE)
consortium are to characterize typical trajectories of brain development from birth through childhood,
measuring the influence of key biologic and environmental factors and their interactions on child social,
cognitive, and emotional development. We will assess how children prenatally exposed to opioids and other
substances, as well as environmental adversity, differ in those brain trajectories and outcomes. Our consortium
consists of six centers (Arkansas Children’s Research Institute, Case Western Reserve University, Cincinnati
Children’s Hospital, Children’s National Medical Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and
Vanderbilt University) which have collaborated previously and have complementary expertise in neuroimaging,
neurophysiology, longitudinal clinical research, child development, substance exposure and addiction,
ethical/legal issues, and clinical care of high-risk infants/children. The PRELUDE consortium will recruit 680
pregnant women with substance use, 680 at-risk pregnant women without substance use, and 1360
comparison pregnant women representative of the general population to contribute to the overall HBCD study.
We will work closely with the other sites, the HBCD Consortium Administrative Core, and the HBCD Data
Coordinating Center to develop a comprehensive study protocol and ensure compliance of study workflow and
data transfer. Our consortium has an optimized research protocol and 4 specific aims: 1) Employ ethical and
evidence-based best practices to enroll and retain a diverse cohort of pregnant women into a longitudinal
study of infant/child brain development, oversampling mothers from high-risk backgrounds and those using
substances during pregnancy; 2) Engage a comprehensive array of maternal- and child-oriented community
stakeholders to identify community concerns and priorities regarding this research, minimize risks, and
promote long-term engagement of the recruited child-mother dyads; 3) Collect rich data to examine how
maternal health context and broader environmental factors may affect the maternal-fetal dyad and
neurodevelopment of children; 4) Capture key developmental windows during which maternal and
environmental factors may interact with brain and behavioral development of children. The insights from
these data will provide greater understanding of factors affecting early childhood brain development,
allowing targeted interventions and improved outcomes for mother-child dyads."
10896985,"One of the most common causes of treatment failure in T-cell leukemia is dissemination of malignant cells. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to test whether inhibition of CDK6 kinase holds promise as an effective
therapeutic strategy for treatment of T-cell leukemia dissemination.
Cyclin D3/CDK6 is the major type of cyclin D/CDK in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and kinase
activity of CDK6 in T-ALL is dramatically enhanced as its inhibitor proteins are mutated in over 50% of T-ALL
cases. Targeting CDK6 for T-ALL therapy is promising as it prevents leukemia cell proliferation and induces T-
ALL apoptosis. It is not clear whether or how CDK6 regulates T-ALL dissemination. In this study, we will
elucidate the novel regulatory mechanism of cyclin D3/CDK6 in T-cell leukemia dissemination. We
obtained substantial preliminary evidence to show that CDK6 plays an important role in T-ALL dissemination by
regulating nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of PFKP. We also found that CDK6-dependent nuclear
enrichment of PFKP may have a prognostic impact in T-cell lymphoma/leukemia. In the proposed work, we will
extend these findings. In Aim 1, we will examine how cyclin D3/CDK6 regulates PFKP nuclear translocation to
promote leukemia invasion. In Aim 2, we will determine how CDK6 mediated PFKP phosphorylation increases
CXCR4 and PD-L1 expression to enhance leukemia cell dissemination. In Aim 3, we will perform a translational
study to test the prognostic value of nuclear PFKP in T-cell lymphoma/leukemia using an expanded clinically
well-annotated cohort of T cell lymphoma/leukemia patients, and a pre-clinical study of the therapeutic effect of
a CDK6 specific degrader on T-ALL mouse models. The expected overall impact of this proposal is that it may
elucidate the molecular function of CDK6 in T-ALL dissemination, and it may lead to novel targeted therapeutic
strategies based on CDK6 inhibition."
10893038,"The goal of “Neurobiology: Mechanisms & Advanced Approaches” (aka the Neurobiology course) at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, MA is to augment conventional training of participants with intensive and immersive training in neurobiology with a particular focus on cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern nervous system function in health and neurological disorders. This program is a comprehensive, research-oriented course that runs for eight weeks, from the mid-June to early August and it is targeted to pre- and post-doctoral trainees as well as early-stage faculty members transitioning into neuroscience. A hallmark of this course is the opportunity to work side-by-side with internationally recognized experts using state-of-the- art technologies. The goal is to empower participants to approach neuroscientific inquiry using the most advanced and appropriate technologies available. A new and unique aspect of the course is the focus on how genetic or environmental perturbations lead to neurological disorders. With a faculty to participant ratio of ≥1:1, participants benefit from ~450 hours of intensive, hands-on instruction in three key areas of modern neurobiology: Functional Genomics, Electrophysiology & Neural Excitability, and Imaging Neuronal Structure & Function. Participants gain practical experience in scientific rigor by designing and executing experiments in team-based research projects. They also receive hands-on training in quantitative data analysis, appropriate statistics, and preparing figures that transparently display their results. Finally, participants learn to avoid unconscious bias and common pitfalls encountered with advanced technologies and how to critically evaluate data. The specific aims of the course are: 1) To introduce students to a breadth of foundational and emerging concepts governing the nervous system in health and neurological disorders; 2) To provide hands-on, multidisciplinary training in advanced techniques for analyzing neuronal structure and function; 3) To impart an understanding of rigorous experimental design and quantitative analysis of neuroscience datasets; 4) To promote independence through building professional skills and a broad mentorship network. Upon course completion, participants will be transformed into rigorous, fearless, and creative scientists, firmly committed to the strategic goals of NINDS, and poised to become the leaders of the future."

Single-cell transcriptomics has revolutionized our understanding of neuronal diversity and enabled high-throughput
characterization of molecular cell types across brain areas and species. We and others have pioneered multi-
modal technologies such as Patch-seq and spatial transcriptomics to link molecularly-deﬁned cell types with their
physiology, cytomorphology, and anatomical features, but we still lack high-throughput, cost-effective methods
that can provide comprehensive synaptic resolution wiring diagrams of entire mammalian brains and integrate
these connectomes with molecularly deﬁned cell types.
 We propose to further develop and validate Rabies Barcode Interaction Detection followed by sequencing
(RaBID-seq) to enable high-throughput, scalable, and cost-effective mapping of brain-wide synaptic-level con-
nectivity and transcriptomic proﬁling of the mapped neurons. We have optimized rabies virus production and
packaging to achieve barcoded libraries containing more than 1.7 million unique barcodes, two orders of mag-
nitude higher compared to prior studies, enough to map the inputs to thousands of post-synaptic neurons in a
single animal. However, this technology still faces several experimental and computational challenges to realize
its full potential. In Aim 1, we will address three potential challenges that may arise when scaling RaBID-seq to
study brain-wide, densely labeled circuits: stochasticity of initial infection and spread, toxicity, and the potential
for polysynaptic events when many founder cells are labeled. In addition, we will develop a new variant of Ra-
bies featuring an evolvable barcode that can disambiguate monosynaptic vs polysynaptic spread in the setting of
dense labeling. In Aim 2, we will benchmark RaBID-seq connectomes against other gold standard techniques
measuring connectivity using multipatch-seq and spatial transcriptomics. In Aim 3, we will develop new algorithms
using graph neural networks to reconstruct monosynaptic connectomes from barcoded viral datasets, assess the
robustness of these algorithms under different experimental parameters in silico, and test whether an evolvable
barcode can improve monosynaptic circuit reconstruction. If successful, these studies will establish RaBID-seq
as a scalable, cost-effective tool for brain-wide connectivity mapping that can integrate transcriptomic cell types
with their synaptic-level wiring diagram at single-cell resolution.
 By reducing the problem of synaptic connectivity into a problem of barcode sequencing, our approach has
the potential to dramatically increase throughput, decrease costs and provide a direct link to the transcriptome
of each mapped cell. RaBID-seq will transform brain-wide circuit mapping into a routine experiment that can be
performed in any lab with modest resources, making it possible to explore how circuits differ between treatment
conditions, in disease states, between the sexes, and across the lifespan. We will also generate pilot data in both
mice and human slice cultures to demonstrate the utility of this tool across species."
10825589,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an adult B-cell malignancy accounting for about a third of leukemia
diagnoses in the US. While B-cell receptor (BCR)-signal-inhibitors are changing the management of CLL, these
are not curative and resistance can develop; often leading to more aggressive disease. Given this, understanding
the molecular events driving CLL oncogenesis and therapeutic resistance warrants in-depth investigation.
CLL is a disease characterized by extensive clonal proliferation and accumulation of malignant B lymphocytes
in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. CLL shows remarkable clinical heterogeneity, with some
patients pursuing an indolent course, while others progress rapidly and require early treatment. In the past 10
years, new insights into the biological function of a mitochondrial lipid kinase, acylglycerol kinase (AGK), as a
key oncogene that is highly expressed in a range of tumor types, including prostate cancer, breast cancer,
cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma have been established. Most
recently, we found aberrantly high level expression of AGK in CLL cells from ~60% of pre-therapy CLL patients.
However, the mechanism of aberrant upregulation of AGK in CLL cells, and its precise functional contributions
to CLL cell biology and pathogenesis remain unknown. Interestingly, we detected nuclear/cytoplasmic
localization of AGK in some CLL clones suggesting its multi-functional role. In line with this, we found that siRNA-
mediated depletion of AGK in primary CLL cells resulted in marked inhibition of constitutively active multiple
signal mediators including AKT, Erk1/2, LYN, BTK (downstream targets of BCR signal) and JAK2. Our
preliminary findings also indicate that MYC may regulate AGK expression in CLL cells. Our combined data
suggest that aberrant expression of AGK may potentiate cell survival signals including BCR and JAK2 in some
CLL clones resulting in resistance to BCR-targeted therapies. Therefore, the central hypothesis of this application
is that aberrant expression of AGK in some CLL clones represents highly aggressive CLL with shorter time to
therapy. We also postulate that AGK upregulation potentiates CLL cell survival signals and resistance to BCR-
targeted agents. We propose – Aim 1: Evaluate if aberrant expression of AGK in CLL cells drives disease
progression; Aim 2: Define the mechanism of AGK upregulation and its role in CLL cell biology, signaling and
potential as a therapeutic target. The proposed in-depth studies will assess if “high AGK” level in CLL cells serves
as a risk factor for CLL progression, time to therapy and treatment outcome; define the impact of AGK aberrant
expression on CLL cell survival and resistance to current BCR-targeted therapies. Thus, the proposed studies
have enormous potential to establish a new prognostic parameter and therapeutic avenue via targeting AGK in
CLL cells with or without the current BCR-targeted therapy, ibrutinib."

 Spatial transcriptomics is a groundbreaking new technology that allows measurement of gene ac-
tivity in a tissue sample while mapping where the activity is occurring. It holds the promise to facilitate
our understanding of spatial heterogeneity underlying essential phenotypes and diseases, such as
neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. However, the development of bioinformatics infrastructures
and computational tools has fallen seriously behind the technological advances. The lack of proper
computational approaches presents current data analysis barriers that signiﬁcantly hinder biological
investigations. The overarching goal of this proposal is to address some of the most pressing ana-
lytic challenges facing proﬁling and interpreting spatial transcriptomics data, including 1) lack of robust
identiﬁcation of genes with spatial expression patterns across a variety of technical platforms, 2) lack
of tools to identify structures, microenvironments as well as developmental trajectory on the tissue,
and 3) lack of tools that can jointly analyze spatial transcriptomic data across multiple samples and
multiple data sources. In the proposal, we will work on the following aims: Aim 1. Develop nonpara-
metric tools for identifying genes with spatial expression patterns. Aim 2. Develop spatially aware
dimension reduction tools for detecting structures and developmental trajectories on the tissue. Aim 3.
Develop integrative association tools for spatial transcriptomic analysis across multiple samples and
datasets. All the methods will be implemented in user-friendly software and disseminated to the sci-
entiﬁc community. Successful achievement of all aims will dramatically increase the power of spatial
transcriptomics analysis, and facilitate the application of these cutting-edge technologies to transla-
tional and clinical studies."
10653852,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Heterotopic ossification (HO) is the pathologic formation of extra-skeletal that is always preceded by an
inflammatory insult and occurs in ~20% of patients after hip arthroplasty, burns or musculoskeletal injury.
Currently, no therapeutics or physical therapy-based protocols exist to prevent or treat HO. In this regard, there
is a void in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HO formation and progression.
 We present data that the histone demethylase, JMJD3, is increased in HO macrophages (Mφs) resulting in
persistent production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFꞵ1) at the HO injury site. This excess TGFꞵ1
causes aberrant mesenchymal progenitor cell (MPC) osteochondral ossification, resulting in HO formation.
Further, using human cells and our experimental clinically relevant murine models of HO, we have identified that
interferon-beta (IFNβ), via a janus kinase (JAK) / signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
mechanism induces JMJD3 in Mφs. These results have led to our central hypothesis that IFNꞵ/JAK/STAT3
signaling directly increases Jmjd3 expression in HO tissue macrophages and that JMDJ3 increases macrophage
Tgfb1 expression thus promoting aberrant MPC fate and HO formation. We further postulate that Mφ specific
repression of JAK1/3 or JMJD3 and thus, TGFꞵ1 production using a novel targeted nanotherapy will halt HO
formation and progression. As such, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: Elucidate the IFNꞵ1/JAK1/STAT3-
mediated mechanism that regulates Mφ-specific JMJD3 expression in human and mouse HO wounds. Aim 2:
Define the regulation of wound Mφ JMJD3 on TGFꞵ1 expression and the paracrine effects of Mφ JMJD3 on
MPC fate under conditions of normal and aberrant wound healing (HO) in vivo. Aim 3: Examine the Mφ specificity
and therapeutic efficacy and timing of Mφ-targeted JMJD3 and JAK1/3 nanoparticles on MPC phenotype and
HO formation. In this translational project, our data will pave the way for the development of promising preventive
nanotherapeutic agents aimed at cell-specific targeting of epigenetic enzymes that mediate Mφ regulation of
MPC fate and thereby prevent HO development following injury."
10881753,"African Americans are significantly underrepresented in cancer research. Although there have been recent
efforts toward more inclusion of African Americans in cancer research, substantial work is still needed.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in the U.S. with ~21,000 new cases
diagnosed each year. CLL is still incurable despite the fact that there have been significant developments in
therapeutic interventions with subsequent improvements in outcome. There are initial findings demonstrating
differences in molecular and clinical characteristics of CLL patients between African Americans and
Caucasians. In particular, African American CLL patients have a younger age of onset, a more aggressive
disease at diagnosis, shorter median time to therapy initiation, and reduced overall survival compared to
Caucasians, even after controlling for therapy, suggesting that other factors may exist that may be driving this
disparity. Despite these differences across these two populations, little is known about the relationship
between genomics, race, and CLL pathogenesis. To date, the genetic landscape of CLL has been
considerably scrutinized but only among individuals of European descendent. The goal of this application is to
directly evaluate the genetic basis of CLL among African Americans with the overall hypothesis that genomic
heterogeneity exists between African American and Caucasian populations that may drive, in part, the disparity
in risk, morbidity, and mortality in CLL. To test this hypothesis, we will leverage our extensive experience in
CLL and applying it to our collection of African American individuals with CLL. In Aim 1 we will perform a
multi-omic (genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic) study in African American CLL individuals and compare
the findings with publicly available sequencing data from Caucasian CLL individuals. With these data, we will
be able to characterize the tumor heterogeneity across these two populations and identify novel somatic
findings. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the known CLL susceptibility loci identified through genome wide
association studies (GWAS) of Caucasians in African American CLL cases and controls in order to provide
insight into the differential risk of the index variants and any other variants in the loci across African American
and Caucasian populations. Finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate the generalizability of our recent findings that
the genomic summary measure, the tumor mutational load, defined as the number of recurrently mutated CLL
driver genes, is prognostic in African American CLLs. The knowledge gained from this application may provide
novel insight into the biological differences in leukemogenesis across these two racial group as well as provide
understanding of the generalizability of the inherited and somatic genetic findings found in Caucasian CLL to
African American CLL. Together these results may improve risk stratification and prognostication among
African American CLL cases, and ultimately, they may provide new insights into possible avenues to reduce
health disparity in CLL."
10895495,"Project Summary Abstract
How remote transcriptional enhancers communicate with their target promoters to regulate gene activity
persists as one of the central mysteries in cell and developmental biology. Classical models envisioned
the formation of chromosomal loops that result in direct physical association of enhancers and promoters.
However, there is emerging evidence that large distances (~200 nm) separate enhancers and promoters
during transcription activation. Moreover, shared enhancers can co-activate linked genes, both in cis and
in trans across homologous chromosomes. These observations are not obviously compatible with classical
models and have prompted an alternate view, “transcription hubs”, whereby enhancers and promoters
recruit large clusters or condensates of transcriptional activators. A major goal of the proposed study is to
determine the role of insulator DNAs and tethering elements in the formation and function of transcription
hubs. Insulators function as boundary elements when interposed between a distal enhancer and target
promoter. They also foster the formation of topological associating domains (TADs) and paring of alleles
located on different homologous chromosomes. In Drosophila, tethering elements are GAGA-rich
sequences that facilitate long-range enhancer-promoter interactions.
We will employ a combination of genome editing, Micro-C XL assays, and quantitative live imaging
methods in living Drosophila embryos to visualize even subtle changes in the timing and levels of gene
expression arising from mutations, inversions, and deletions of defined insulators and tethering elements.
Particular efforts will focus on long-range enhancer-promoter communication within complex genetic loci.
For example, we will examine the role of tethering elements in the activation of Scr transcription by a
remote enhancer that must bypass an intervening TAD within the Antennapedia Hox gene complex. We
will also explore the contributions of individual insulators and tethering elements for the co-regulation of
linked genes by shared enhancers over distances of 75 kb and 235 kb in the knirps and Scylla loci,
respectively. Finally, we will examine the possibility that low complexity sequences in tethering factors
(e.g., Trithorax-like) contribute to the stability of enhancer-promoter loops by nucleating the formation of
activation condensates. These studies have the potential to unravel current controversies regarding the
importance of insulators, TADs, and tethering elements in gene regulation during development. They might
also reveal new connections between chromosomal loops and the formation of transcriptional hubs."

While the cerebellum's role in motor function is well recognized, the cerebellum also plays cardinal roles in
affective regulation, cognitive processing, and linguistic function (1). Indeed, there is a growing recognition that
disruptions of cerebellar development cause considerable cognitive, behavioral, and social deficits (2-6). Yet,
though cerebellar malformations are amongst the most commonly recognized structural brain malformation in
prenatal imaging (7-10). Reliable information about their cause is sparse (11, 12). Diagnosis is based on
imaging studies which are often unreliable, a problem amplified during fetal development (13, 14). In stark
contrast to the wealth of knowledge gained over the decades regarding the mechanisms and genes driving
cerebellar development in mice and other model organisms (15-19), we actually know very little about human
cerebellar development. We recently reported multiple aspects of human cerebellar development significantly
differing from mice and even rhesus macaque, a non-human primate. These discoveries challenge our current
mouse-centric models of normal cerebellar development and the pathogenesis human cerebellar
developmental disorders (20). This proposal seeks to advance knowledge of normal developing human
cerebellum and cerebellar birth defects, leveraging 1) our unique access to normal and abnormal human fetal
cerebellar tissue and 2) our extensive, specific expertise of mouse and human cerebellar development and our
deep knowledge of human cerebellar malformations. Our detailed characterization of normal and abnormal
cerebellar development, combined with humanized mouse models will improve our understanding of the
biology of normal human cerebellar development and the pathogenesis of a clinically important human
cerebellar birth defect, Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM). They will provide gold standard histological and
transcriptomic datasets to assess model systems of human cerebellar development, generate the first
“humanized” mouse models of human cerebellar development and finally, enable improved and sorely needed
prenatal diagnostic information for families affected by cerebellar malformations."

Resilience, defined as the ability to respond to stressors, declines with age and co-morbid conditions in older
organisms. To date, little progress has been made to improve our understanding of resilience with aging and
its multi-component dimensions in response to physical, cognitive, and social stressors, in part because
resilience itself is likely a dynamic multi-systemic process that is most evident under conditions of stress. This
application is for a five-year cooperative conference grant to continue the successful “Geriatrics Research:
Bench-to-Bedside” series. The series has had an outstanding impact. Past conferences represented
“paradigm-shifting” moments and “pivotal” junctures in areas such as frailty, multimorbidity, and delirium. Here
we propose to build bridges and bring together resilience scientists and experts from the physical, cognitive,
and social domains to discuss, debate, and learn from each other the dynamic multi-component phenomena of
resilience. In the first conference, Overview of the Resilience World: State of the Science, we will focus on
setting the stage and discuss working definitions of resilience from physical, cognitive, and psychosocial fields.
A goal will be to identify areas of commonalities and differences and how we can operationalize a shared
concept so that “resilience” can be quantified appropriately in different contexts. In the second conference,
Stress tests and Biomarkers of Resilience, we aim to discuss resilience stress test paradigms and
molecular markers that may be associated with resilient outcomes. Building on the first conference, this
conference will refer to operationalized definitions of resilience and resilient outcomes, acknowledging that
definitions may differ slightly across fields and contexts. Lastly, the third conference is entitled Optimizing
Resilience. By integrating the foundation built in the first two conferences, we will focus on interventions to
optimize resilience in older adults. This conference series, once completed, will serve as a forum and a
unifying thread that will bring together national research leaders to build an integrative multidimensional
understanding of resilience in older organisms."
10928887,"Project Summary:
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has among the highest resistance rates of any pathogen globally, but Mtb
resistance remains the most challenging to diagnose due to its very slow growth in in vitro culture and culture’s
inordinate cost and biohazard. Rapid and accurate alternative diagnostic approaches are urgently needed. DNA
based tests are available for detecting resistance to a few drugs but are limited by their need for extensive
knowledge of DNA resistance determinants for interpretation, and concerns about limit of detection at the point-
of-care. For novel antibiotics entering clinical use, genetic resistance determinants are particularly poorly
understood and may be too dispersed across the genome to lend themselves to targeted sequencing and delays
in understanding mechanisms may miss an opportunity to avoid more widespread resistance. A work around is
the development of a functional or phenotypic assay that circumvents the need to target specific genetic
mechanisms, however there is no such rapid assay currently commercially available largely because these
assays have traditionally relied on observed bacterial growth in vitro under antibiotic pressure. Leveraging
considerable preliminary data from our group and others, we propose the development of an innovative
‘functional’ RNA-based assay for resistance diagnosis in Mtb. We anticipate increasing sensitivity of resistance
detection, expanding the numbers of drugs to which resistance can be detected, while significantly shortening
time-to-result. Specifically, in this early phase development proposal we will identify key assay parameters that
maximize the Mtb RNA susceptibility signal to five key agents in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis treatment
(bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid, moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide) using RNA sequencing in a factorial design
of experiments assessing drug exposure dose and exposure duration. In addition, we will study the effect of key
clinical variables including genetic resistance mechanism, background lineage (Aim 1). In Aim 2 we will work
with NanoString technologies to develop hybridization probe sets (that we call nanosensors for short) to target
antibiotic responsive and control genes in two iterative phases. This will be followed by assay performance
assessment in vitro, and on sputum from participants newly diagnosed with rifampicin resistant TB before and
after incubation in culture media. This work will build a strong foundation for an innovative resistance diagnostic
that addresses an unmet need."
10885981,"Project Summary
 The proposed project is designed to advance our understanding of the development of category learning –
a fundamental component of human intelligence. The proposed research is based on the hypothesis of
multiple mechanisms sub-serving category learning: (a) an early developing mechanism (Mechanism1) is
based on distributed attention and learning of within-category statistics and (b) later developing mechanism
(Mechanism2) is based on selective attention to category-relevant information. Under Mechanism1, both
relevant and less relevant dimensions are encoded, with learned representations being similar to the input
stimulus structure (i.e., no learning-based representational change). Under Mechanism2, learned
representations are different from input stimulus structure (we refer to this difference as learning-based
representational change). Differences between Mechanism1 and Mechanism2 will transpire in many
performance indicators, including attention allocation during learning, memory for features, shapes of learning
curves, and accuracy and response times during training and testing. To test these hypotheses, we will
conduct a series of experiments with 4-9-year-old children, and adults. The proposed project has the following
Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 is to conduct cross-sectional experiments and a longitudinal study examining
mechanisms of category learning across development. Mechanism1 and Mechanism2 predict qualitatively
different patterns of (1) attention allocation, categorization, and memory and (2) pre- and post-learning
representations of categories. Specific Aim 2 is to apply computational models to data collected within Study 1
to identify the differences between the two hypothesized mechanisms of category learning. To achieve this
goal, eye gaze and categorization and memory choice and response time data will be submitted to a suite of
models capturing the hypothesized mechanisms. The proposed project will advance our understanding of links
among critical aspects of typical cognitive development – selective attention, category learning, and memory."
10863868,"Project Summary
The CHCHD10 gene coding for a mitochondrial protein is mutated in familial and sporadic
Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and mixed FTD-ALS. The
estimated prevalence of CHCHD10 mutations is 7.7% among FTD in the Chinese population and
0.68-2.6% among FTD-ALS patients of European descent, making CHCHD10 the second most
frequently mutated gene in FTD and FTD-ALS. We know that the FTD-ALS CHCHD10S59L
mutation and the ALS CHCHD10R15L mutation promotes CHCHD10 aggregation and
mitochondrial dysfunction. However, as only 1 patient with CHCHD10 mutation (ALS-linked
CHCHD10R15L) and no FTD patient with CHCHD10 mutation has come to autopsy, we do not
know the pathological signatures of CHCHD10-driven pathogenesis and to what extent such
signatures are present in sporadic diseases (i.e. FTD, FTD-ALS, AD). As misfolded proteins tend
to clog and inhibit the proteasome, such misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins are frequently
translocated into mitochondria as an alternative pathway for proteostasis. We recently generated
transgenic (Tg) mice expressing wild type (WT) CHCHD10WT, CHCHD10R15L, or CHCHD10S59L
driven by the neuronal mouse PrP promoter, which show clear pathophysiological phenotypes.
By taking advantage of mouse models and human postmortem tissues together with molecular,
biochemical, histochemical, proteomics, electrophysiological, and behavioral toolsets, this
proposal will test the overarching hypothesis that the loss of endogenous CHCHD10 (as seen in
sporadic ADRDs) and FTLD/ALS-linked CHCHD10 mutations drive diverse pathological
signatures resulting from disruptions in mitochondrial proteostasis and autophagic clearance of
proteotoxically challenged mitochondria, and that restoration of WT CHCHD10 represents a
viable strategy to mitigate proteotoxic burden and disease outcomes. Aim 1 will define the role of
wild type CHCHD10 in mitigating pathological phenotypes in vivo. Aim 2 will identify and validate
the neuropathological signatures of FTLD/ALS-linked CHCHD10 mutations. Aim 3 will determine
the role of mutant CHCHD10 in mitophagy flux in vivo."

Chemical toxicants and carcinogens present in the polluted air are the likely causative agents in the associated
cancers of aerodigestive tract in exposed individuals. Understanding the relationship between the level of
exposure to these pollutants and the risk of cancer is key to identifying individuals or populations at risk and
informing the development of preventive measures. The overarching goal of this study is to advance such
understanding through a collaborative research between the Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota
and Centre for Cancer Epidemiology (CCE) in Mumbai, India. We will employ a panel of established and novel
air pollution-related biomarkers to test our overall hypothesis that the uptake of air pollution-related chemical
carcinogens is associated with the risk for LC and HNC in Indian nonsmokers. In Aims 1 and 2, we will conduct
case-control studies to assess the association of air pollution-related biomarkers in plasma with LC and HNC,
respectively, in Indian nonsmokers. To achieve the goals of these Aims, we will use available biological
samples and questionnaire data from the corresponding epidemiological cohorts conducted by the CCE. We
will develop capacity for biomarker measurements at CCE by transferring the U.S. team's expertise in this
area. In Aim 3, we will recruit healthy nonsmokers with various levels of usual exposures to air pollution, based
on their occupation or lifestyle. We will compare a panel of biomarkers of exposure and effect across the
groups and correlate to pollutant levels collected through personal air sampling devices worn by a subset of
participants. We will use specially designed air samplers to characterize the chemical profile of various air
pollution scenarios. This aim will aid in the interpretation of biomarker data generated in Aims 1 and 2, and will
inform future biomarker-based studies of air pollution in India. An important outcome of this study is the
development of capacity for future biomarker research of cancer risk in India using CCE cohorts. Such
research can be further expanded to other population subgroups (e.g., smokers or occupationally exposed
individuals) and additional environmental and dietary exposures in India."
10665053,"The Iowa City VA Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Visual Loss (CPTVL) focuses on the early
detection of potentially blinding disorders of the Veteran and general population caused by disorders of the eye
and nervous system that mediate visual perception, light sensitivity, eye movements, blinking, pupil
movements, ocular sensation, and pain. The Center tests new ways of determining the earliest sign of disease,
its progression and response to treatment. New treatment innovations are discovered by a dedicated group of
VA scientists and clinicians who study the cellular mechanisms of disease. Key discoveries utilize machine
learning and artificial intelligence in combination with advanced ocular imaging to elucidate structure and
function of the eye and central nervous system. Resulting discoveries provides important, clinically relevant
biomarkers of eye and neurologic disorders. These include reflex movements of the eyes, pupils, eyelids and
facial muscles of expression in three dimensions for objective diagnosis and monitoring of treatment. Many
diseases of the nervous system, cardiovascular system and immune system are manifested in the eye, making
it an ideal platform to detect, monitor and develop new treatments for ocular and systemic disorders affecting
Veterans. The Center's mission of prevention and treatment of visual loss is carried out in 3 main spheres of
research: Telemedicine, Cellular Mechanisms of Disease, and Novel Therapeutics.
Telemedicine: Advanced technology is developed for automated telemedical assessment of ocular structure
and function to facilitate diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of treatment of visual disorders and related central
nervous system diseases. This includes an innovative effort to enable smartphone devices for assessing vision
and neurologic reflexes which are important readouts of many disorders affecting the eye and nervous system.
The CPTVL partners with manufacturers of eye imaging devices and pharmaceutical companies to provide a
translational framework for clinical implementation, with rapid dissemination of benefits to Veterans.
Cellular Mechanisms of Disease: Therapeutic discoveries along a translational framework are built upon the
identification of cellular mechanisms of disease. Traumatic brain injury is being emphasized because of its
significant sensory, psychiatric and neurologic morbidity in Veterans.
Novel Therapeutics: The discovery of new treatments for disabling conditions involving the visual system is a
major focus of CPTVL rehabilitation for improving vision and quality of life of Veterans. Current therapeutic
targets of high priority include glaucoma, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain
injury, migraine, and light sensitivity.
An important new initiative of the CPTVL is to link readouts of vision and neurologic function to quality of life
metrics in Veterans. By doing so, we intend to discover which readouts have the largest impact on quality of
life and quality of vision. This will provide much needed insight into which visual functions hold the greatest
importance as outcome measures. The linking of readouts of vision to quality of life can be individualized for
personalized medicine initiatives.
Key Words: telemedicine, glaucoma, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic peripheral
neuropathy, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, light sensitivity, migraine, ocular imaging."
10934521,"ABSTRACT: PROJECT 1
Almost 9 million US adults currently smoke cigars, which cause multiple cancers, including oral, esophageal,
laryngeal, and lung cancer. Over the last two decades, while cigarette consumption declined 48%, cigar
consumption increased 115%, mostly due to increased use of little cigars and cigarillos (LCCs). LCC rates are
highest in young adults (YA) ages 18-29, with disproportionately higher prevalence among Black YAs.
Communication campaigns have played powerful roles in reducing cigarette use, but no national campaigns
have yet focused on cigar or LCC use. There has been little research in communication science to reduce LCC
use, especially in social media, where YAs spend substantial time. Research is needed on identifying the
themes most likely to reduce LCC use; whether changing incorrect beliefs about flavors, harm, and addiction is
an effective approach; and how to increase attention and engagement with digital messages. These advances
will help reduce disparities in LCC use if done with a content co-creation approach, including involving Black
and other YAs in the development process. This project’s goal is to advance communication science to inform
campaigns to decrease YA LCC use, especially among Black YAs. This aligns with the UNC TCORS
integrative theme of building the science for effective regulation of and communication about tobacco products
disproportionately used by priority populations, including cigars. Project 1’s Aim 1 develops potentially
impactful theory-driven communication themes for reducing LCC use among YA LCC users. The team will
identify a comprehensive set of beliefs about LCC use and use a national survey to determine which beliefs
about LCC use are most promising to develop campaign messages that are then vetted with YA LCC user
focus groups. Aim 2 tests digital ad design features and messaging to identify those ads that maximize
attention and engagement among YA LCC users. The research team will work with design professionals to
create Instagram-like LCC ads for the messages and enhance them with design features to increase attention
and engagement. These ads will then be refined with focus groups and used in an eye-tracking experiment on
smartphones to compare digital LCC messages with and without the enhanced design features in a simulated
Instagram environment. Aim 3 conducts a multi-week randomized controlled trial to determine the
effectiveness of digital campaign ads with enhanced design features in promoting increased quit intentions
among YA LCC users. Participants in the trial will be exposed to Instagram-like enhanced LCC campaign
digital ads or control ads. The research team is optimally prepared for this project based on unique expertise in
cigar communication, message and campaign development, and reducing disparities. The proposed studies
respond to the RFA’s Communication and Behavior domains and will inform communication campaigns to
reduce LCC and other tobacco use and advance methods to reduce tobacco-related disparities."
10934525,"ABSTRACT: PROJECT 2
In the US, 18.5 million people smoke menthol cigarettes. The largest disparities in menthol cigarette use are
between Black and white smokers. Rates are also higher among lesbian/gay and bisexual (LGB) smokers vs.
straight smokers. FDA has proposed to ban menthol as a characterizing flavor in cigarettes. The benefits of a
menthol ban could be dramatically amplified by a quit smoking campaign that gives menthol smokers the tools
they need to quit smoking altogether, rather than switch to different cigarettes. The primary goal of Project 2’s
proposed research as part of the UNC TCORS is to evaluate whether the benefits of a menthol ban could be
amplified by a quit smoking campaign, with a focus on the priority populations of Black and LGB people who
smoke menthol. The project will also provide rigorous causal evidence about the impact of a menthol cigarette
ban on cigarette purchases. To achieve these goals, we will first develop a campaign to encourage priority
menthol populations to quit smoking using our team’s multi-phase message development process involving
expert feedback, focus groups with priority populations, and an experiment with a nationally representative
sample of menthol smokers. We then will evaluate a menthol cigarette ban alone, and a ban paired with a quit
smoking campaign, in an RCT. The RCT will leverage 3 locations of our team’s Mini Mart (i.e., a small
convenience store designed for research), allowing for greater external validity of study findings and for
measurement of consumer behavior in the context of a shopping trip. The Mini Mart is uniquely suited to test
the interaction of interventions including policies and campaigns. Our proposed research will also shed light on
the psychological mechanisms through which a menthol ban and campaign influence consumer purchasing
behavior, using mixed-methods mediation techniques. This research will inform FDA’s menthol regulation and
potential industry challenges to their proposed rule banning menthol as a characterizing flavor in cigarettes.
Expected results of this project will include audience-informed campaign materials to encourage menthol
cigarette smokers to quit smoking altogether, rigorous causal evidence of the impact of a menthol ban on
cigarette purchases, and an understanding of whether a campaign can amplify the benefits of a menthol
ban. This project aligns with the UNC TCORS Center Integrative Theme of building the science for effective
regulation of and communication about tobacco flavored products disproportionately used by priority
populations. This research addresses RFA-OD-22-004 Scientific Domains of behavior, communications, and
impact analysis. We propose research in multiple priority areas of the RFA by using innovative methods to
assess the impacts of a menthol ban and campaign in priority populations."
10934531,"ABSTRACT: PROJECT 3
The objective of this project is to estimate the public health impact of a federal flavored cigar ban on tobacco
use, mortality and health disparities in the United States. This project will build a microsimulation model of
individuals living in the US who are current, former, or potential users of cigars, cigarettes and e-cigarettes.
The model can be used to track tobacco use over time, so the impact of a flavored cigar ban on smoking and
mortality in the US population and in priority populations for tobacco control, such as among people who are
Black or have lower incomes, can be estimated. The microsimulation model will be built in three phases
corresponding to the specific aims. Specifically, using data from the nationally representative, longitudinal
Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study, we will estimate tobacco use transition probabilities over
time, with a focus on the effects of cigar use on initiation, cessation, and dual/poly use of tobacco products
(Aim 1). We will conduct a systematic review to compile data on cigar users’ tobacco use after a flavored cigar
ban and elicit potential policy design effects from tobacco experts. Tobacco experts will be asked to develop
plausible and distinct flavored cigar ban scenarios to simulate and compare, and quantify how key post-ban
contextual factors (e.g., policy enforcement) affect the impact of the ban (Aim 2). Finally, using findings from
Aims 1 and 2, and estimates from the literature, we will build a microsimulation model to estimate how tobacco
use and mortality changes in the presence of a federal flavored cigar ban and in plausible moderating
circumstances, such as with weak tobacco retailer compliance with a ban (Aim 3). This project will provide a
comprehensive understanding of the potential public health impact of a flavored cigar ban, critical scientific
evidence to counter likely legal challenges against a federal ban. We will also identify key threats to policy
effectiveness for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to monitor and address in collaboration with local
and state partners to maximize the public health benefits of the policy. This project addresses FDA research
priorities to assess the impact of tobacco product characteristics (i.e., flavors) on initiation and cessation
(Behavior, Aim 1) and to understand the public health impact of potential FDA regulatory action on tobacco use
behavior and health (Impact Analysis, Aims 2 and 3). The University of North Carolina (UNC) Tobacco Centers
of Regulatory Science (TCORS) has deep expertise in tobacco regulation and communications. The Center’s
Integrative Theme is building the science for effective regulation of and communication about tobacco products
disproportionately used by priority populations – flavored tobacco products."
10934535,"ABSTRACT: PROJECT 4
Smoking prevention campaigns are an effective tool for reducing adolescent and young adult cigarette
smoking. However, the science of vaping prevention campaigns is just beginning to emerge. Vaping prevention
video ads contain a large number of different objective ad features, and we currently know little about which ad
features are most impactful for adolescents and young adults. We also know little about whether impactful ad
features differ for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adolescents and young adults who are more likely to vape
than their peers. The primary goal of our project is to characterize the objective features of vaping prevention
video ads to determine which ad features best predict perceived message effectiveness and most reduce
susceptibility to vaping. Our work also explores whether impactful ads and ad features differ by sexual
orientation, as well as an examination of unintended consequences of vaping prevention ads (e.g.,
encouraging cigarette smoking). For Aim 1, we will characterize the objective features of hundreds of vaping
prevention video ads from our Vaping Prevention Resource (VPR) – the largest open access archive of vaping
prevention messages in the country – and other sources. For Aim 2, we will identify which features of video
ads predict perceived message effectiveness and unintended effects using an online experiment with 3,000
adolescents and young adults (ages 13-20, oversampling LGB participants) who are at-risk of vaping or
currently vape. Based on the results, we will select 5 ads with promising features and 5 ads without promising
features for the Aim 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT). For Aim 3, we will evaluate the ability of vaping
prevention video ads with features found to be most promising in Aim 2 to reduce susceptibility to vaping. We
will recruit 1,200 adolescents and young adults (ages 13-20, oversampling LGB participants) who are at-risk of
vaping or currently vape to participate in an RCT with 3 online study sessions over 4 weeks. We will conduct a
2-arm trial where participants are randomized to view 1) ads with promising features (intervention) or 2) ads
without promising features (control). Our primary outcome is susceptibility to vaping and our secondary
outcomes include vaping risk beliefs, attitudes toward vaping, and vaping behavior. We will also explore
differences in ad impact by sexual orientation as well as unintended effects on cigarette smoking outcomes.
Our proposal fits within the integrative theme of the UNC TCORS of building the science for effective regulation
of and communication about tobacco products disproportionately used by priority populations – e-cigarettes –
in the U54 proposal “Advancing Tobacco Regulatory Science to Reduce Health Disparities.” Our project is
responsive to the FDA Scientific Domains of Communications (Aims 1-3) and Behavior (Aim 3) in RFA-OD-22-
004. This work will provide crucial knowledge about which features of vaping prevention video ads are most
effective for adolescents and young adults, leading to more impactful vaping prevention campaigns."
11072208,"BIOBEHAVIORAL SHARED RESOURCE ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of the Biobehavioral Shared Resource (BBSR) is to enhance the feasibility and success
of Moores Cancer Center (MCC) investigators studying the link between lifestyle behaviors and effect of
interventions, as well as biological indicators of cancer outcome, to reduce cancer risk and increase survival
following the diagnosis of cancer. The SR provides expertise and guidance in developing and operationalizing
behavioral research for MCC members who do not necessarily have expertise in these areas, or who have
limited resources to use high-quality, science-based methodology without the context and efficiency of a
consolidated service core. The BBSR provides services across three categories: (1) biological indicators of
behavior and assessment for determining molecular mechanisms, (2) behavioral assessment, and (3)
behavioral interventions. Biological indicators assessment services include development of protocols for
biospecimen collection and processing; development and provision of procedures for the processing, storing
and/or shipping of samples; and direct services for phlebotomy, sample processing, preparation of samples for
analysis (e.g., DNA extraction), and analysis. Behavioral assessment services include providing devices,
training, and processing of data to improve the quality of data collection for physical activity and sedentary
behavior assessment; direct services for telephone-based dietary recalls and measurement of body
composition; and assistance with web-based 24-hour dietary recalls and diet history questionnaires. Behavioral
intervention services include guidance on intervention design and content based on theoretically-grounded and
empirically-supported weight loss, diet and physical activity interventions; protocol development for
interventions that are specifically targeted to meet the needs of study populations and behavioral outcomes;
supervision and quality control; and providing guidance and best practices for using a variety of new
technologies and communication modalities for self-monitoring. Thus, the BBSR provides access to
specialized technologies, services and expertise in lifestyle behavior and assessment of biological factors that
enhance scientific interaction and productivity, enabling MCC members to successfully obtain funding and
publications in peer-reviewed, high-impact journals. The BBSR is led by a Faculty Director, Co-Directors, and
operations staff who are highly qualified, with the requisite expertise across the scope of these scientific and
technical areas. Furthermore, the BBSR has a solid leadership and succession plan in place. For a relatively
modest investment, SR staff are enabling cancer-focused behavioral studies by MCC PIs that could not
otherwise go forward. Since the prior CCSG review, the resource has continued to contribute to scientific
efforts in numerous major grants and projects."
11072210,"CANCER BIOLOGY AND SIGNALING ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of the Cancer Biology and Signaling Program (CBS) is to provide fundamental scientific
knowledge for the molecular and cellular basis of cancer (including initiation, progression, and metastasis) and
the interaction between cancer and the immune system. Scientific discoveries of CBS members are aimed to
provide molecular targets for cancer detection, diagnosis, and therapy through 2 aims: 1) understand signaling
pathways involved in cell growth regulation; 2) investigate the molecular mechanisms of oncogenic development
and progression. For these goals, research conducted by CBS members during the current project period has
made a number of major advancements on signaling pathways in cell growth control, mechanisms of oncogenes
and tumor suppressors in oncogenesis, and interaction between cancer and host immune system. The central
themes of CBS include 1) signal transduction and 2) cell growth, with a developing focus on immunity in
tumorigenesis. Drs. Dong-Er Zhang and Kun-Liang Guan have been CBS co-leaders since 2008. They have
complementary expertise (alteration of transcription of liquid cancer development and signal transduction
regulating growth of solid cancer cells) and share a common vision for future success of CBS, which will continue
to advance basic knowledge and provide the scientific basis for early cancer prevention, detection, and
treatment. The 52 members of CBS represent 11 departments and 3 schools. In 2017, CBS members had
$18.6M in cancer-relevant, peer-reviewed funding (direct costs), of which $8.3M (45%) was from NCI, $9.1M
(49%) was from other NIH sources, and $1.1M (6%) was from other peer-reviewed agencies. In addition, CBS
members had $1.6M in cancer-relevant, non-peer reviewed funding (direct costs) During the project period
(2013-2017), members authored 669 cancer-relevant publications, of which 78 (12%) were intra-programmatic,
162 (24%) were inter-programmatic, and 190 (28%) were collaborative with investigators from other NCI-
designated cancer centers."
11072212,"SOLID TUMOR THERAPEUTICS ABSTRACT
The overall goal of Solid Tumor Therapeutics (STT) is to develop novel therapeutics and strategies for the
treatment of non-hematologic malignancies and to advance the diagnostic and biomarker tools needed to
individualize their use. As a result, STT directly supports the mission, vision, and strategic priorities of MCC,
which has prioritized exploiting MCC’s discoveries to maximize our ability to tailor cancer care plans based on
each patient’s personal profile. The 59 members of STT come from diverse disciplines but are joined together
by their shared research interest in solid tumor biology and treatment. Reflecting this, members are drawn from
16 departments and 4 schools. In 2017, program members had a total of $22.3M (direct costs) in cancer-focused
funding. $13.0M (direct costs) is peer-reviewed funding, of which $6.0M (46%) was from NCI, $3.9M (30%) was
from other NIH sources, and $3.0M (23%) was from other peer-reviewed agencies. During the project period,
members authored 1662 cancer-relevant publications, of which 255 (15%) were intra-programmatic, 295 (18%)
were inter-programmatic, and 485 (29%) were collaborative with investigators from other NCI-designated cancer
centers. STT members also led 64 early phase investigator-initiated trials (IITs), which include translation of 20
of MCC’s scientific discoveries to the clinic through 26 IITs, a 13-fold increase over 2 such IITs between 2008-
2012. Accrual to STT treatment IITs increased by 218%, from 223 (2008-2012) to 709 (2013-2017). STT’s
specific aims are to: 1) Identify tumor vulnerabilities, mechanisms, and targetable alterations; 2) Develop new
classes of therapeutics and delivery systems; 3) Develop novel technologies to detect tumors and define tumor
geography, microenvironment, and exploitable metabolic and signaling defects; and 4) Establish the clinical
benefit of novel therapeutics and genome-driven treatment strategies. The cross-cutting themes are: A) Immune
Oncology; B) Cancer Stem Cells, and C) Patient-specific Precision Therapy. STT is co-led by Ezra Cohen, MD,
an expert in head and neck cancer and the clinical application of immune oncology discoveries; and Jeremy
Rich, MD, MHS, MBA, whose career has focused on cancer stem cells and brain tumors. Their highly integrated
efforts foster collaboration among the outstanding investigators in STT, who are leaders in their fields and have
track records of extraordinary productivity."
11072214,"HEMATOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES PROGRAM ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of the Hematologic Malignancies Program (HEM) is to advance the treatment of
hematologic malignancies and reduce the side effects of treatment through the conduct of translational and
clinical research performed by HEM members and collaborators. This will be accomplished by providing a
clinically tractable understanding of somatic mutational, epigenetic, and proteomic drivers of myeloid and
lymphoid neoplasm pathogenesis, using whole genome, epigenome, whole transcriptome and Nano-
proteomic assays, and developing effective small molecule, biologic, and/or cellular therapies for patients
that mitigate the risk of relapse. The program is led by Thomas Kipps (Professor, Medicine) a nationally
recognized investigator in lymphoid malignancies, who founded the program, and Catriona Jamieson (Professor,
Medicine) a cancer-stem-cell biologist focused on myeloid malignancies who joined Kipps in 2013 to broaden
the program’s research scope and capabilities. HEM received an outstanding rating during the last CCSG
renewal. The program’s scientific aims are to 1) use functional genomics, single cell transcriptomics,
epigenetics, and proteomics to identify somatic DNA mutations, coding and non-coding RNA processing and
ribosomal alterations in myeloproliferative neoplasms, myelodysplastic syndrome, leukemia, multiple myeloma,
and lymphoma that promote therapeutic resistance and/or relapse, with a particular emphasis on cancer-stem-
cell biology; 2) generate niche-relevant cell culture, transgenic, and/or humanized mouse models of pre-
leukemia, leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of disease, and
validate somatic DNA, RNA processing alterations and aberrant signaling pathways as therapeutic targets; and
3) test promising new approaches in Phase l/ll clinical trials with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies
that examine whether the targeted molecular pathways are inhibited by therapy and establish surrogate
endpoints for activity of novel therapeutic strategies for patients with myeloid or lymphoid malignancies, providing
information for later-stage clinical trials. These aims align with the mission of the MCC, which is to mitigate the
risk of developing cancer and improve the outcomes of patients with cancer within and beyond the catchment
area; this represents a major focus of the strategic plan. The program’s 39 members represent 10 departments
and 2 schools at UCSD, and 2 institutes: the La Jolla Institute (LJI) and The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI).
In 2017, members had $15.4M (annual DC) in cancer-focused peer-reviewed funding of which $2.4M was from
NCI; $13.0M was from other peer-reviewed agencies including other NIH sources and the California Institute for
Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). During the project period, members have been involved in clinical translation of
5 Moores Cancer Center discoveries, authored 390 cancer-relevant publications, of which 63 (16%) were intra-
programmatic, 76 (19%) were inter-programmatic, and 146 (37%) were collaborative with investigators from
other NCI Cancer Centers."
11072216,"CANCER CONTROL PROGRAM ABSTRACT
The mission of the Cancer Control Program (CCP) is to reduce the burden of cancer from prevention to
survivorship. Specific Aims are: (1) to prevent tobacco-related cancers by reducing the prevalence of tobacco
product use, (2) to prevent obesity-related cancers through lifestyle and community intervention approaches, (3)
to interrupt the development of cancer through screening, early detection, and testing interventions in
premalignant neoplasia, and (4) to enhance the quality and length of survival of persons diagnosed with cancer
through treatment and intervention. CCP addresses the catchment area by conducting studies in underserved
populations including Hispanics, older adults, and low-income populations; and its research on locally prevalent
cancers. CCP research includes extensive use of technology in the objective assessment of cancer risk factors
and the delivery of lifestyle interventions. In 2017, Kerr (UC San Diego) and Elder (San Diego State University
(SDSU)) were appointed Co-Leaders of the CCP. They are internationally recognized scientists who share a
commitment to mentoring and catchment-based research, while bringing complementary expertise in disparities
(Elder) and technology (Kerr). Through resources, organization, and leadership support for the CCP, Moores
Cancer Center (MCC) provides a valuable platform for population scientists that results in collaborative scientific
accomplishments and makes an impact on reducing the cancer burden in the MCC catchment area. CCP
includes 36 members, of which 80% are PIs of peer-reviewed grants. CCP is highly transdisciplinary and includes
28 population scientists (biostatisticians, behavioral scientists, epidemiologists, economists, geographers), 7
clinicians, and 1 basic scientist. Twenty-eight percent of members are faculty at SDSU, an MCC consortium
partner. In 2017, program members had $8.4 Million in cancer focused, peer-reviewed funding (direct costs), of
which $2.4 Million (29%) was from NCI, $4.2 Million (51%) was from other NIH sources, and $1.7 Million (20%)
was from other peer-reviewing agencies. During the project period, members authored 985 cancer-relevant
publications, of which 245 (25%) were intra-programmatic, 170 (17%) were inter-programmatic, and 383 (39%)
were collaborative with investigators in other NCI-designated cancer centers. Accruals in 2017 were 461 in
interventional studies and 660 in non-interventional studies. CCP members play key roles in the educational and
training activities described in the Cancer-Related Career Enhancement and Related Activities resource. Future
plans include expanding CCP expertise in dissemination and implementation science to collaborate with other
program members and translate findings into practice, harnessing CCP expertise in technology to expand the
reach of intervention recruitment and delivery to the catchment area and developing joint activities to foster the
development of collaborative and clinical efforts in cancer detection and prevention."

The goals of the Structural and Functional Genomics Program (SFG) are aligned and integrated with the vision
and strategies of Moores Cancer Center (MCC) and the UC San Diego School of Medicine. They use the SFG
members’ interdisciplinary strength and expertise in computational biology and genomics to employ a full range
of both structural and functional genomic data to elucidate complex signaling pathways and identify candidate
targets and compounds that can be translated into novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets and clinical interventions.
Approved by the NCI in 1997, the Cancer Genetics Program has evolved to SFG to reflect how, during the past
project period, members have expanded use of multi-omic data types, moved analysis methods to molecular
tumor boards, and elucidated context-dependent molecular states for more targeted treatments. SFG has 36
members from 14 academic departments with $19.2M of peer-reviewed research grant funding (annual direct
costs), $6.3M (33%) of which is from the NCI. SFG members published 714 programmatically aligned articles
since 2013, 11% were the result of intra-programmatic collaborations, 20% were inter-programmatic, and 34%
were inter-NCI Cancer Center. SFG’s specific aims are to: 1) develop innovative, integrative computational
genomic methods that synthesize multi-omic patient and clinical data to drive fundamental and translational
cancer research and to disseminate them to the broader cancer research community; 2) analyze genetic,
transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic, immunologic, and metabolomic data to elucidate the underlying biological
pathways and mechanisms of cancer development and progression; and 3) characterize context dependent,
functional states of tumor cells and understand the dynamics of resistance in order to identify novel diagnostic,
prognostic, and therapeutic strategies, including combination therapies. SFG themes are data science and
machine learning, signature and network approaches, and precision therapy. SFG is co-led by Joseph Califano,
a head and neck surgeon and translational researcher who applies genomics to develop novel prognostic
indicators and therapies and Jill Mesirov, a computational biologist who analyzes complex genome-scale cancer
datasets to better understand the underlying mechanisms of cancer, stratify patients, and identify candidate
therapies. Their complementary expertise and highly integrated efforts foster collaboration among the outstanding
SFG investigators who are leaders in their fields with track records of extraordinary productivity and inter-
programmatic collaborations among the MCC research programs. As a result, SFG members have conducted
paradigm-shifting studies defining the broad role of extrachromosomal DNA in human cancers, developed
carcinogen-based mutational signatures across cancer types, demonstrated the role of the microbiome in
hepatocellular cancer development, and produced and maintained key computational methods and tools used
by hundreds of thousands of scientists worldwide."
11072223,"COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT ABSTRACT
San Diego County (SDC), the Moores Cancer Center (MCC) catchment area, is a minority-majority region, in
which non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) are not the majority population (46%). Hispanics comprise 33.5% of the
population and Asian Pacific Islanders (APIs) make up 12.8%. A sizeable percentage of individuals in SDC are
foreign-born (23.5%) and have limited English proficiency (15%). Through MCC’s Community Outreach and
Engagement (COE), knowledge of cancer burden and community needs shape its research agenda and
outreach activities to address the cancer-relevant needs of the catchment area. The overarching goal of the
MCC COE is to decrease the burden of cancer in SDC by facilitating research relevant to this burden, engaging
with communities and health care providers, and partnering with local and state agencies to disseminate and
facilitate the implementation of evidence-based recommendations. This goal is accomplished through the
following Specific Aims: 1) Assess cancer burden and use this knowledge to facilitate transdisciplinary research
relevant to the MCC’s catchment area; 2) Address cancer disparities along the cancer continuum, from primary
prevention to survivorship, through research and community engagement; 3) Disseminate evidence-based
practices and resources for cancer prevention, screening, treatment and outcomes to communities and providers
in the catchment area; and 4) Engage with regional, national, and global partners to extend MCC’s reach beyond
the catchment area and impact policy. The goal and aims of the COE are accomplished working under a structure
that includes a Steering Committee and a Community Advisory Board. MCC’s community outreach has had
substantial impact in facilitating research and policy for cancers that are prevalent in SDC and those that
disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minority and underserved populations. Future directions will build upon
ongoing activities and recently-funded research. MCC will continue to expand community-academic
partnerships, including those with federally qualified health centers, to better address the needs of medically
underserved communities. Continued efforts to enhance minority accrual to therapeutic trials and participation
in research projects are an essential part of the COE."

scientific agendas that advance the mission of MCC. MCC has used its developmental funds to support new
scientists, developing shared resources, and multi-disciplinary, translational research.
During the period, pilot projects were used to strengthen innovative, multi-disciplinary, collaborative, translational
and clinical research in support of CCSG Research Program themes; and produced a high return on investment.
Development funds helped recruit 7 high-performing investigators with great promise for continued growth of
MCC goals in key programmatic areas, resulting in a significant increase in collaborative research focused on
translation and investigator-initiated clinical trials. The recruitments strengthened research areas recommended
by the MCC External Advisory Board.
Over the next project period, MCC will use development funds to support these 3 key areas that are critical to
MCC mission, vision and areas of scientific focus that are aligned with the MCC Strategic Plan:
1. Pilot Projects – to foster innovative translational, population science, and clinical research pilot projects that
 have potential for creating new avenues of research, new collaborations across MCC and its consortium
 partners, and more effective interventions for cancer patients and individuals at higher risk for cancer.
2. Recruitment/New Investigators – to recruit promising and productive scientists and clinical investigators to
 supplement and complement existing membership in 5 high priority areas identified in the MCC Strategic
 Plan (Cancer Control, Immune Oncology Translational Research, Cell Therapy Translational Research,
 Neuro-oncology Clinical Scientist, and Hematology/BMT Clinical Scientist).
3. Early Stage Clinical Investigators – to further develop, mentor and advance skilled and dedicated early stage
 clinical investigators pursuing studies of new therapies and prevention strategies."

11072231,"The Moores Cancer Center (MCC) Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) oversees and provides 
independent, peer review of the scientific merit, priority, and progress of all cancer studies 
involving human subjects conducted at the University of California, San Diego, its affiliated Rady 
Children's Hospital as well as cancer-related population sciences research conducted at MCC's 
 consortium partner, San Diego State University. PRMS functions are accomplished by 
rigorous review in a 2-stage process conducted by:
1) MCC multidisciplinary Disease Teams, where initial assessment of value, fit, and 
prioritization within the existing portfolio of studies is performed as well as an assessment 
of each study's operational and accrual feasibility; and 2) the Protocol Review and Monitoring 
Committee (PRMC), which is the definitive independent authority for determining which studies 
proceed to activation. The Disease Teams' input and approval are required before 
proceeding to the PRMC; however, only the PRMC has final and independent authority with regards to 
determining which studies will be activated and which underperforming studies will be closed. The 
PRMC has the primary goal to ensure that all MCC-aligned cancer research studies involving human 
subjects are: 1) scientifically sound; 2) effectively designed, specifically from a biostatistics 
perspective; 3) appropriately prioritized within MCC's Disease Teams' research portfolios to avoid 
competing trials as well as aligned with MCC's overall institutional priorities for clinical 
research; 4) feasible for completion or in meeting institutional accrual goals; 5) assessed for the 
adequacy of the data and safety monitoring plans based on the risk level of the study; and 6) 
monitored regularly for accrual and scientific progress. In 2017, the MCC Disease Teams have vetted 
in aggregate 198 studies and forwarded 165 of these studies to PRMC review. Once received by the 
PRMC, 46 of these studies received an initial expedited review by the PRMC Chair, Vice Chair, or a 
PRMC designee as they had already received an appropriate external scientific peer-review, and 119 
of these studies, primarily representing MCC's investigator-initiated and industry-sponsored 
trials, were forwarded for full PRMC review. More than 22% of the studies reviewed by the PRMC 
required modifications prior to being approved, and 3 studies were disapproved and not allowed to 
proceed through the activation process. In addition, the PRMC also conducted scientific and accrual 
progress reviews for all actively accruing MCC studies for which 24 underperforming studies were 
closed in 2017. The MCC PRMS, inclusive of the Disease Team and PRMC review processes, is one of 
the most critical functions that the MCC performs to ensure the highest quality of research is 
being conducted at MCC."
10890757,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - Administrative Core
The mission of the UC Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (UCD ADRC) is to advance the science of
healthy brain aging while caring for those affected by dementia. To accomplish this mission, we have
created a highly integrated and collaborative environment with extensive resources to support studies
on the heterogeneity of cognitive aging and progression to dementia among diverse populations. The
Administrative Core (AC) supports this mission through overall direction and optimal utilization of center
resources with emphasis on strategies that encompass 1) development of new research initiatives, 2)
leveraging available resources through integration of research effort and pursuit of research funding, 3)
program growth through local, national and international collaborations and initiation of new programs, and,
finally, 4) pursuit of funding sources for training of junior scientists so as to expand and provide continuity for
our program of research on aging and ADRD. Our approach addresses a number of milestones set by the
National Alzheimer’s Project Act by 1) evaluating disparities among ethnic and racial minority populations that
are at higher risk for AD to mitigate risk and improve cognitive outcomes, 2) fully characterizing mixed
pathologies and identifying unique risk factors,3) accelerating the development of treatments that would
prevent, halt, or reverse the course of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), 4) improving early diagnosis through
discovery of novel imaging and serum biomarkers, 5) developing novel dementia treatment strategies, and 6)
supporting caregiving through funded caregiver research. The AC also has a long tradition of supporting the
overall NIA ADC Network to achieve NAPA goals “…through increasing flexibility and collaboration by
leveraging resources, capabilities and research participants across the network”. Consistent with our overall
approach, the AC also has historically contributed to efforts to “…unify goals, ensure that resources are most
efficiently utilized, and is suitably flexible to facilitate the ability of the ADC network to respond to a dynamic
scientific environment while incorporating the needs of all stakeholders…” As such, the AC provides
outstanding leadership along with the infrastructure and the administrative support needed to meld the various
Cores and geographically dispersed units of the UCD ADRC into a true, coherent and effective research
center. Specifically, the AC will direct and strategically plan to utilize the full complement of resources and
expertise of the UCD ADRC, incorporating the developmental projects, our community based research
approach and extensive research training program to fulfill the milestones of NAPA."
10890762,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Clinical Core (CC)
The mission of the UC Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (UCD ADRC) is to advance the science of
healthy brain aging among diverse populations while caring for those affected by dementia. This mission and
the work of the Clinical Core (CC) contribute to many of the milestones and goals set forth by the National
Alzheimer’s Disease Plan (NAPA). The CC is essential to the UCD ADRC’s mission, in part, by maintaining the
Longitudinal Diversity Cohort (LDC), a large, highly diverse group of older adults followed annually through
autopsy, and by overseeing the collection of the multiple sources of data obtained from these individuals. This
cohort is highly unique among ADRCs in that it includes substantial numbers of older adults from two of the
largest underrepresented groups in the U.S.: African Americans (~25% of the cohort) and Hispanics (~25%).
This diversity translates into heterogeneity of cognitive trajectories, incident Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias (ADRD), risk factors and lifecourse experiences, and the prevalence of vascular risk factors
consistent with community populations, thereby providing a valuable resource for studying both AD and mixed
pathologies. The sample is similarly diverse in terms of education (range of 0-20 years), native language,
socioeconomic and immigration status, and exposure to adversity. Through primarily community recruitment,
the UCD ADRC enrolls cognitively normal and mildly impaired individuals to study cognitive decline and the
transition to various stages of disease. This facilitates identification of novel modifiable risk and protective
factors and biomarker development, both of which have implications for dementia prevention. All individuals in
the LDC are characterized at an uncommonly rich level (well beyond the UDS) that includes neuroimaging and
blood biomarkers, annual diagnostic classification, psychometrically rigorous measurement of cognition and
daily function (separate from measurements used for diagnosis) and extensive collection of lifecourse
sociocultural and behavioral data. The LDC is a well established cohort with extensive data from both active
(n=425) and inactive cases (n>950), some with 15+ years of follow-up. All of this data has been integrated into
the UCD ADRC database that provides an easily accessible research resource widely utilized by researchers
both within and outside of our Center. Data from the LDC has contributed to innovative new research findings
in many areas including enhancing our understanding of ethnic/racial disparities in cognitive aging and the
contributions of vascular disease to brain health, among many other contributions. In addition, the CC has the
added advantage of creating bi-directional translational relationships with epidemiological studies aimed at
understanding the complex determinants of ADRD and accelerating the development of effective treatment
and prevention across the ADRD spectrum."
10876336,"Advanced Spectroscopic and Computational Analysis of Metal Sites in Enzymes, Biomimetic Models, and
Catalytic Intermediates.
Summary/Abstract
 Life of all organisms, including humans, depends on the activation of small stable molecules by
metalloproteins to provide selective and rapid chemical transformations. The goal of the proposed
research is to elucidate how specific metalloenzymes function by monitoring and analyzing the atomic
level changes that occur at the metal active site during the reaction. These studies are augmented with
benchmark studies of biomimetic complexes. The understanding gleaned from this work will provide a
molecular basis for finding causes and remedies of diseases. The focus of the research efforts will be on
how the interfacing of the active sites in metalloproteins with the protein matrix affects enzymatic
function. The primary atomic coordination to the metal is of critical importance, but in many cases, weaker
secondary sphere interactions, usually hydrogen bonds from nearby amino acid residues can have
significant influence as well. The investigations in our lab use advanced spectroscopic and computational
methods, providing detailed characterizations of the metal active sites in proteins that can be compared
with an extensive database of benchmarks that we and other researchers have gathered from synthetic
model complexes over the years. To understand how an enzyme works, we study key steps in their
chemical mechanism by trapping and characterizing reactive intermediates and tracking their elemental
kinetics on a millisecond time scale. The work is highly collaborative as we depend on the expertise of
many synthetic and biochemical research groups to ensure access to biomimetic and protein complexes
that can be, through joint effort, prepared cleanly with well-defined protocols."
10900711,"Self-harm, violence and road accidents, the leading causes of mortality in Guyana, engender preventable, yet
sustained public health crises. Guyana’s trauma/injury mortality burden is the highest in South America, with its
suicide rate (80% pesticide ingestion) the third highest in the world. Fortunately, the Guyanese leadership, both
academic and governmental, have demonstrated a strong public health commitment to addressing these
problems. Unfortunately, however, the country does not currently have research capacity in trauma/injury
prevention on which to build evidence-based, context-specific prevention strategies. We propose, therefore, a
cross-national, cross-institutional collaboration, to transition their current capacity in trauma/injury research, by
jointly creating the Guyana Research in Injury and Trauma Training (GRITT) Program, a Sister Program of the
Columbia (University) Center for Injury Science and Prevention (CCISP). GRITT will provide in-depth training in
research design and methods, combined with jointly mentoring trainees through intensive, hands-on research
projects and by facilitating entry into advanced degree programs (Masters or Ph.D.). GRITT will be built on
collaboration between the Columbia University and Guyana’s Ministry of Health ongoing NIMH funded
longitudinal epidemiological national study of suicide. The primary institutions devoted to establishing and
sustaining GRITT are the University of Guyana, Georgetown Public Hospital Corporation, and Columbia’s
Mailman School of Public Health Dept. of Epidemiology. In a transparent, competitive process designed to
ensure under-represented participation, GRITT will train along four pathways, allowing for variations in discipline,
levels of expertise, professional roles and geared toward pursuit of a Masters or PhD in the area of trauma/injury
research. The four research training pathways are: (1) Health Professionals in the Accident and Emergency
Department and the Guyana Emergency Medical Services will receive individual mentoring and participate in
collaborative on-the-job research projects designed to enhance careers as researchers in trauma/injury
prevention; (2) Medical Residents will be offered training in research methods and group/individual mentoring
focused on trauma/injury; (3) Masters students (Public Health, Nursing, Social Work, Psychology, Education,
Pharmacy) will be offered research-focused virtual courses, intensive summer training, and a jointly mentored
research practicum/project on a trauma/injury topic, geared to pursuit of a research career, including a Ph.D.,
and; (4) Health care Post-Bacs, participating in a Columbia University Certificate program will receive on-line
training in research methods and will be supported for a Masters degree focused on injury/trauma prevention.
Also, in the first six-months and then on a regular basis, GRITT faculty, staff and local Mentors will participate in
workshops focused on research methods, including identification of projects for faculty/students, e.g., self-harm,
interpersonal violence, road accidents. Workshops will also include effective mentoring techniques and establish
interactive learning approaches for the shared virtual monthly trauma/injury Seminar Series at CCSIP."
10929942,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Decoding the regulation of protein folding by synonymous codon usage
Synonymous mutations are widespread in complex, polygenic diseases but are typically regarded as
phenotypically silent, as they preserve the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Yet, synonymous
mutations can significantly perturb protein homeostasis through a variety of mechanisms, including perturbing
the folding mechanism of the encoded protein. Recently, my lab discovered that synonymous codon-induced
changes to protein folding can be large enough to (a) exceed the protein homeostatic buffering provided by
molecular chaperones and (b) lead to a dramatic two-fold decrease in cell growth rate. For these proteins,
changing the codon usage pattern produces a folded protein with an altered structure, which leads to changes
in activity and/or susceptibility to degradation by cellular proteases. The profound implication of these results is
that codon usage represents another level of information encoded within genomes, linking together “silent”
genetic differences with proper protein function and regulation of a potentially broad range of cellular
mechanisms. Historically, however, studying perturbations to protein folding mechanisms in vivo has presented
immense technical challenges. For this reason, to date only a few examples have been identified of connections
between codon usage and protein folding. As a result, we lack a comprehensive picture of the extent to which
synonymous codon usage contributes to the production of a functional proteome and how synonymous
mutations perturb protein homeostasis. This Pioneer Award project is designed to break through existing
technical challenges, developing a novel approach to (i) broadly measure for the first time the number and types
of proteins with folding mechanisms sensitive to synonymous codon usage, across an entire proteome and (ii)
deeply interrogate which codon usage patterns and features best support proper protein folding in vivo. The
ambitious, overarching goal of this project is to enable a next generation of genomic inference by developing a
predictive understanding of the synonymous codon usage patterns that best support production of a functional
proteome and the dysregulation that leads to human genetic disease."
10899472,"This proposal for the GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy Project (GUDMAP) will use the mouse model to investigate how differences between male and female external genitalia arise at the single cell level. Congenital malformations of the external genitalia (CAEG) are among the most prevalent human birth defects, affecting ~1:150 live male births. Hypospadias is a CAEG that is characterized by ectopic opening(s) of the urethra on the ventral side of the penis. In severe hypospadias, the urethral plate can open along the entire underside of the penis, giving it a clitoris-like appearance. This condition is termed ambiguous genitalia. Genetic causes of hypospadias have been elusive. The global prevalence has led to increased scrutiny of environmental factors, particularly endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that can induce genital anomalies in animal models. Sexual differentiation of the embryonic genital tubercle (GT) into a penis or a clitoris is regulated by gonadal androgens and estrogen. The central role of sex hormones in GT development creates sensitivity to EDCs; however, the mechanisms that mediate EDC effects on the GT are unknown, particularly at a cellular level. Do EDCs that cause hypospadias act on all cells in the GT, or do they target specific cell types? If subpopulation(s) of hormonally-responsive cells control urethragenesis, then buffering those cells against EDCs could be a method for prevention of hypospadias (analogous to folic acid’s ability to prevent neural tube defects). For genetic hypospadias, identifying cell-specific gene functions can distinguish direct regulators of urethragenesis from genes with indirect effects (e.g. sensitivity to EDCs). Understanding cell type diversity in developing external genitalia is essential for identifying the causes of CAEG and for developing preventative strategies. A major obstacle to progress in prevention and treatment of CAEG is the lack of knowledge of the specific cell types in external genital tissues. This project aims to fill these critical knowledge gaps by using single cell RNA-sequencing combined with novel imaging modalities to map cell type diversity in the developing external genitalia of normal male and female mice."
10894931,"Project Summary/Abstract. Women with dense breast have not been shown to benefit by increased cancer
detection of volumetric digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) but may benefit by lower recall rates. DBT screening
biopsy rates are similar to 2D digital mammography; higher for first screening exams, lower thereafter with
adjustment for age and breast density. In the U.S., 71% of biopsies do not result in a breast cancer diagnosis
among women ages 40-79 who undergo breast cancer screening. To address the high rate of unnecessary
biopsies, an innovative way to use FDA-approved breast imaging protocols has been developed to acquire
multispectral images to measure the lipid/water/protein (L/W/P) composition of suspicious breast lesions.
Malignant breast tissue has unique L/W/P composition fractions when compared to normal or benign breast
tissue. This proposal aims to increase biopsy yield (BI-RADS-PPV3) through combining L/W/P biological
biomarkers with quantitative morphological and textural image analysis. This combination of composition and
physical descriptions of suspicious breast lesions is called q3CB. The benefits of adding q3CB to the current
DBT screening/diagnostic imaging paradigm, that may already include computer aided detection, is not known.
This study is designed to compare the expected biopsy yield with and without q3CB in a clinical reader study
and explore how q3CB may be combine with existing technologies. The central hypothesis is that biological
L/W/P fractions in breast tissue in combination with analysis of morphological and textural tissue
characteristics will yield significantly higher breast cancer specificity than conventional interpretation of DBT
alone. The objective is to better identify suspicious breast lesions that need to be biopsied for malignancy in
women currently recommended for biopsy. The long-term goal is to reduce unnecessary biopsies and increase
biopsy yield. Our rationale for the proposed research is that biological L/W/P descriptions of breast lesions will
lead to more specific biopsy decisions and a better understanding of cancer types. Specifically, the project
aims are 1) develop q3CB lesion signatures for distinguishing breast cancer lesions from benign lesions, using
600 prospectively-acquired DBT exams of women recommended to undergo biopsy; 2) conduct a clinical
reader study to compare radiologists' performance on standard-of-care FFDM or DBT without and with the
inclusion of q3CB signatures; 3) Investigate the utility of q3CB lesion signatures in a screening paradigm to
improve sensitivity and specificity on CADe-identified suspicious lesions in the tasks of assessing malignancy
as well as in associating with their association with cancer subtypes; Exploratory) explore the added sensitivity
and specificity of dual-energy DBT in phantom studies that explore lesion size, composition, and breast
density. The innovation of this study is the full characterization of lipid/water/protein lesion composition with
DBT and how it complements existing computer aided diagnostic programs paired with clinical radiologists
providing evidence ready for clinical translation of this unique and emerging technology."
10894167,"Pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (PNAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in childhood.
Progression from fatty liver (FL) to steatohepatitis (NASH) significantly increases risks for cirrhosis,
hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure. In children, PNAFLD may progress far more rapidly than in adults,
which is important to understand but mechanisms underlying this disease worsening are unknown. Active liver
growth is a unique aspect in children; however, whether this physiological process may affect outcomes in
PNAFLD has not been studied. To address the fundamental basis of hepatic injury and repair in PNAFLD, I
obtained grounding in basic and translational research incorporating liver regeneration mechanisms within the
overall context of hepatic DNA damage and inflammation. My work led to ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
gene and downstream molecular pathway in regulating hepatic DNA damage response, including cell growth-
arrest after hepatic injury as a critical barrier to liver regeneration. My recently published study in adults with
NAFLD substantiated that acquired ATM insufficiency is a critical element in progression from fatty liver to
NASH. Since the integrity of genomic and mitochondrial DNA is critical for postnatal liver growth and
subsequent organ health, I then hypothesized that ATM dysregulation during hepatic growth will exert a
negative impact on PNAFLD. In this proposal, I develop this possibility through two interrelated objectives. In
specific Aim 1, I test the hypothesis that ATM dysregulation will impair liver repair and regeneration in
PNALFD. This will be advanced through detailed analysis of already available liver samples from our fatty liver
clinic cohort in the Bronx. The role of ATM signaling in cellular events and processes during progression of
PNAFLD will be identified by array-based technologies and functional genomics approaches for differentially
expressed mRNAs and proteins. Additional mechanisms for liver regeneration related to progenitor cell
populations prevalent in growing liver of children will be examined in robust cell-based assays. In specific Aim
2, I will employ molecular loss-of-function approach to experimentally develop and validate the role of ATM.
This will incorporate a novel mouse model for PNAFLD with disease induction through high fat diet and
chemical injury during hepatic growth phase. The human-specific relevance of this model will be substantiated.
I am well-prepared to conduct this research with appropriate clinical and research training background
although this K-08 award will help advance further skill sets for investigative career development. This proposal
incorporates exceptional mentoring team and advisors, including world-class expertise in liver regeneration,
stem cell biology, molecular epidemiology, and epigenomics. I have formulated a targeted career development
plan to advance my scientific capacity and leadership skills. Together with outstanding institutional commitment
and environment, this career development effort will increase potential for extramural funding targeting

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) comprises 20% of childhood leukemia cases. In contrast to acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL), cure rates for AML remain poor with the majority of patients dying from refractory leukemia or
treatment related toxicities. In contrast to AML in older adults, genome-wide studies of AML in children,
adolescents, and young adults (AYA) revealed a lower mutational burden and highly prevalent transcription
factor fusions and RAS pathway mutations. Additionally, while transcription factor fusions are hypothesized to
promote a transcriptional signature that is permissive for AML development, experimental data suggest that
signaling mutations play a central role in driving leukemic growth in vivo. Thus, simultaneously targeting the
abnormal transcriptional program and aberrant signaling pathways in AML is a rational therapeutic approach
that is particularly relevant in children and AYA patients.
The overall goals of this proposal are to investigate the efficacy of promising drug combinations that
simultaneously target key pathways in pediatric AML and to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying drug
synergy and resistance to these targeted approaches through the following specific aims: (1) to identify and
validate mechanisms of drug synergy and resistance to BET + MEK inhibition; and, (2) to investigate the in
vivo efficacy of this combination in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models of pediatric AML."
10927308,"Analytical Redox Core – Project Summary
The South Carolina COBRE in Oxidants, Redox Balance and Stress Signaling (Redox COBRE) Analytical Redox
Core (ARC) offers infrastructure, expertise and training to Center members to support the successful application
of quantitative techniques for the study of redox homeostasis and cellular bioenergetics. This includes unique
approaches, technologies and equipment specific to the detection of redox-sensitive molecules and enzymes
that drive redox homeostasis. The aims of the ARC are to: provide investigators with advanced capabilities in
quantitative analytical redox biochemistry; state-of-the-art bioenergetic profiling; analysis and characterization of
redox signaling pathways; and in particular, expert mentoring, education, training and consultation with COBRE
personnel are top priorities of the ARC. Thus, we are able to impart the importance of redox signaling pathways
in human disease, ensuring ongoing Core utilization and development of our user base, while enabling scientific
discovery by COBRE investigators and the greater MUSC research community. During Phase III, we will
integrate key resources (e.g., Seahorse XF bioenergetics profiling assays) previously available through the
Bioenergetics Core that is now no longer available. Combined with our expertise in analytical biochemistry, the
Phase III ARC aims to provide COBRE members with a multidisciplinary and comprehensive suite of services
for quantifying ROS/RNS species and redox-modified proteins as well as characterization of their impact on
bioenergetic networks and pathobiological processes."
10885142,"To function normally, all cells must maintain ion homeostasis and regulate water content.
The lens is unusual because it is made from a packed mass of fiber cells that are
incapable of independently maintaining ion and water homeostasis. The fiber cells rely
on ion transport mechanisms in a monolayer of epithelial cells at the lens surface. Na,K-
ATPase and NKCC1 activity are particularly important. To monitor and control this
arrangement, the lens has come to rely on exquisitely specialized remote control
mechanisms that utilize TRPV4 and TRPV1 channels. A TRPV4 feedback loop senses
swelling in the fiber mass and increases Na,K-ATPase activity to compensate. A TRPV1
feedback loop senses shrinkage in the fiber mass and increases NKCC1 activity to
compensate. The feedback loops are important. They explain homeostatic regulation of
lens ion transport as well as intracellular hydrostatic pressure, and they fit with the
Mathias model of lens circulation. TRPV4 and TRPV1 appear to be master controllers of
lens homeostasis. The specific aims are: (1) Test the hypothesis that the
TRPV4/hemichannel/Na,K-ATPase response to swelling stretch involves a functional link
between TRPV4 and the actin cytoskeleton; (2) Test the hypothesis that the
TRPV1/ERK/NKCC1 response to shrinkage involves a functional link between TRPV1
and the tubulin cytoskeleton; (3) Explore reserve mechanisms of lens ion and water
homeostasis. Aims 1 and 2 focus on unanswered mechanistic questions regarding
TRPV4 and TRPV1 activation by opposing mechanical stimuli, TRPV4-dependent
hemichannel opening, and the mechanism of NKCC1 activation. Aim 3 follows up pilot
studies on reserve mechanisms that support slower homeostatic responses or serve as a
fail-safe backup. The proposed studies are highly significant as regards human vision
because preservation of lens transparency and refractive index gradient depends on ion
and water homeostasis."
10807035,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There has been widespread proliferation of e-cigarette use (i.e., vaping) among young adults (YAs), as well as
evidence of strong associations between vaping with cigarette initiation and continued smoking. Despite this,
there are no evidence-based vaping interventions with tailored content specifically for YAs that is easily
accessible to this age group (i.e., online and viewable on mobile phones) and targets smoking
susceptibility. Perceived social norms, such as overestimations of how prevalent and accepted vaping and
smoking are, and misperceptions of the harms of vaping and smoking appear to play key roles in YA vaping
and smoking behaviors. Indeed, beliefs about social norms, perceptions of harm, and motivations associated
with vaping and smoking are linked to vaping frequency and likelihood of smoking onset among YAs; thus,
targeting these in a brief intervention can be efficacious. Vaping and smoking prevalence and acceptance will
be collected from a longitudinal cohort of YAs ages 18-22 (N~2200; Aim 1). These data from Aim 1 will be
used to develop and beta test a brief, online intervention that incorporates personalized normative feedback
(PNF), aspects informed by Motivational Interviewing, and education to address misperceptions about vaping
and smoking norms and harm. As part of this aim, we will evaluate acceptability and feasibility of intervention
content, including believability of the norms presented and interest in the content (Aim 2). The finalized
intervention will then be pilot tested among YA current e-cigarette users who have never smoked (N = 50) with
an assessment-only control (N = 50; Aim 3) to determine efficacy of the program in reducing vaping frequency
and smoking susceptibility. Results from this project will be informative in (1) elucidating social and cognitive
factors that contribute to and maintain vaping behaviors in YAs and (2) inform future intervention approaches
designed to mitigate the risks of nicotine dependence among the rapidly increasing population of young
vapers. Results will be used as framework for an R01 application to conduct a larger randomized controlled
trial to test the efficacy of this intervention. I enter this project with strong quantitative skills as a clinical
researcher with growing proficiency in tobacco research. This K01 is essential for me to develop additional
expertise in areas that will support my objectives of becoming an independent, multidisciplinary investigator of
determinants of substance use in YAs. This proposal will afford me with protected research time to develop
expertise in a) predictors of addiction and its application to tobacco-product use in youth, b) technology-based
substance use intervention development and evaluation, and c) longitudinal study design and advanced
analytic methodologies, with mentorship to further refine my skills in the application of my research to inform
policy, prevention, and early intervention efforts. I have worked closely with my proposed mentors to develop
an ambitious but feasible training curriculum that integrates expert mentoring; coursework, seminars, and
readings; scientific meetings; and growth in advanced analyses and manuscript and grant writing skills."
10865080,"Project Summary
For the prognosis of melanoma, lung cancer, and many other cancers, G-E (gene-environment) interactions
have important implications. Through a series of studies, our group has taken a unique robustness perspective
and a leading role in developing the foundation of G-E interaction analysis using cutting-edge high-dimensional
and regularized statistics. Recently, our group pioneered I-E (histopathological imaging-environment) interaction
analysis and significantly expanded the scope of cancer analytics. We have made important discoveries for NHL,
melanoma, and lung cancer, impactfully advancing their translational research and clinical practice.
 Our overarching goal is to construct more powerful prognosis models and more accurately identify G-E/I-
E interactions so as to truthfully describe cancer biology and informatively guide clinical decision-making. In this
project, we will be the first to develop paradigm-shifting SDL (statistically principled deep learning) techniques
tailored to G-E/I-E interaction analysis for cancer prognosis. The proposed methods will inherit strengths from
the existing deep learning and regression techniques and be superior to both. We will continue analyzing data
on melanoma and lung cancer, further enhancing the high translational and clinical impact of our study.
 We will: (Aim 1) Develop foundational SDL techniques tailored to G-E/I-E interaction analysis. We will
first develop “benchmark” nonrobust losses and then innovatively advance to losses that are robust to model
mis-specification and long-tailed distribution/contamination. A novel penalization technique will be applied for
architecture construction, which will accommodate the unique characteristics of the main G/I effects, main E
effects, and their interactions in a customized manner, screen out noises, and respect the “main effects,
interactions” hierarchy. (Aim 2) Boost performance by incorporating additional information. We will cost-
effectively improve SDL performance by incorporating additional information on (a) the interconnections between
prognosis and G-E/I-E interactions as well as main G/I effects, and (b) the interconnections among G/I variables.
(Aim 3) Expand analysis scope and integrate multiple types of G/I measurements. Motivated by their overlapping
but also independent information for prognosis, we will develop novel SDL methods and be the first to integrate
multiple types of molecular and imaging measurements in interaction analysis. (Aim 4) Analyze the Yale SPORE
and TCGA data on melanoma and lung cancer. Analysis will be conducted on multiple prognosis outcomes.
Demographic/clinical/environmental risk factors, multiple types of molecular measurements (protein, gene
expression, mutation, methylation, and microRNA), and histopathological imaging features will be analyzed. The
analysis results will be thoroughly and rigorously evaluated, extensively compared to those using alternatives,
and validated in multiple ways."
10891602,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Obesity is highly prevalent in the U.S. and has significant consequences for mortality and quality of life.
Obesity is the primary gateway to additional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as increased insulin
resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Prospective studies have estimated that nearly 75% of cases of
hypertension can be attributed to obesity. Hallmarks of obesity-related hypertension are oxidative stress, chronic
inflammation, and vascular dysfunction. However, our understanding of the precise mechanisms underlying the
development of hypertension in obesity and insulin resistance remains incomplete. We hypothesize that
hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia augment vascular sensitivity to single bursts of sympathetic nerve activity
(SNA) via oxidative stress to heighten blood pressure variability in obesity and insulin resistance. Using a double-
blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized approach, we will determine the extent to which sympathetic-vascular
transduction is elevated by hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia and resultant oxidative stress and the extent to
which suppression of oxidative stress via ascorbic acid attenuates the exaggerated increase in vascular
sensitivity to single bursts of SNA. Given our innovative approach, these studies provide direct insight into the
ability of single bursts of SNA to dynamically regulate vascular tone and blood pressure. We will also test the
novel hypothesis that sympathetic blockade mitigates the pro-inflammatory phenotype of obesity. Obesity is also
characterized by chronic inflammation, which is mediated in part by the sympathetic nervous system. Expression
of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) can be regulated by norepinephrine.
The urgency to mitigate inflammation in obesity has recently been accelerated by the increased risk of poor
outcomes following infection by SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, recent data show that circulating concentrations of pro-
inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) are positively correlated with poor outcomes in patients with
SARS-CoV-2. We propose sympathetic blockade as a novel approach to mitigating the pro-inflammatory
phenotype of obesity and hypertension. To demonstrate feasibility of our hypothesis, we have performed pilot
studies using a randomized, double-blinded, parallel study design in a small group of overweight/obese adults
using 4 weeks of oral clonidine to reduce central sympathetic outflow and observed significant reductions in
MSNA and circulating TNF-α but no change in MSNA and circulating TNF-α following 4 weeks of placebo or
hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) as a BP-lowering control condition. We plan to extend these preliminary data in our
outlined studies to achieve sufficient power to observe signficant and clinically meaningful group differences in
circulating and endothelial cell pro-inflammatory cytokines. The long-term goal of our research is to identify
unique mechanisms that can be targeted to limit increases in vascular dysfunction in obesity and insulin
resistance and reduce the excessively high prevalence of hypertension and risk for CVD."
10889948,"In eukaryotic cells, genomic DNA is packaged into chromatin that encodes epigenetic information and maintain
genome integrity. Chromatin is further organized into distinct functional domains, such as heterochromatin and
euchromatin, that contain different post-translational histone modifications (PTM). How different chromatin states
are inherited during S phase of the cell cycle is one of the most challenging questions in the chromatin and
epigenetic fields. The “first” step in this complex process is the assembly of replicated DNA into nucleosomes
using both parental and newly-synthesized histones in a process that is tightly coupled to ongoing DNA synthesis.
We have been studying how nucleosomes are formed following DNA replication and have made multiple major
contributions to this process. However, how parental histone (H3-H4)2 tetramers, the primary carrier of epigenetic
modifications, are transferred to replicating DNA is still poorly understood, which hinders our understanding of
the transmission of epigenetic information into daughter cells. The major challenge to understanding parental
histone (H3-H4)2 assembly is a lack of methods to track this process. We have developed the eSPAN
(enrichment and Sequencing Protein- Associated Nascent DNA) method that can discern whether a protein
binds to leading or lagging strands of DNA replication forks in both yeast and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.
This method makes it possible to identify factors that function in nucleosome assembly of parental histone (H3-
H4)2. Moreover, we discovered that cells defective in parental histone transfer compromise the repression of
endogenous retrovirus (ERVs), repetitive DNA elements that are normally silenced via a heterochromatin-based
mechanism. Others show that ERV reactivation in cancer cells leads to increased response to immunotherapy.
In this proposal, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms whereby parental (H3-H4)2 are reassembled into
nucleosomes following DNA replication in yeast and mouse ES cells and determine how deficiencies in this
process impact ERV silencing. Together, these studies will address fundamental questions regarding chromatin
replication and epigenetic inheritance, while also providing novel insights into a major epigenetic mechanism
that boosts the response of cancer cells to immunotherapy."
10825607,"Project Title: MicroRNA lipid-nanoparticle based therapy targets neuroinflammation and ApoE dysregulation
in Alzheimer’s disease
Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding regulatory RNA that have large impacts in health and disease.
While prior studies have implicated miRNA in Alzheimer’s disease and associated dementias (ADRD), they
have not been used yet in a successful therapeutic strategy. We discovered that microRNA-223 (miR-223), a
miRNA residing on the X-chromosome which is enriched in microglia/macrophage cells, regulates a sexually
dimorphic ApoE pathway via targeting CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBPβ). CEBPβ is an important
regulator of neuroinflammatory response and acts as a transcription factor mediating ApoE expression.
 Our recent data showed that deficiency of miR-223 resulted in a substantial, female-biased elevation of
CEBPβ, ApoE, and a heightened inflammatory state in macrophages and in aged mouse brain following a
brain injury. Thus, miR-223 appears to regulate a sexually dimorphic microglia/macrophages-dependent
increase in inflammation and ApoE as brain cells become activated in parallel with age, injury, and/or
Alzheimer’s disease-related pathology. We further demonstrated that miR-223 can be targeted using a novel
miRNA-liposome delivery system. Based on these exciting preliminary results, the main goals of this proposal
are to test the miR-223-CEBPβ pathway in regulating inflammation-triggered ApoE dysregulation in the
biological context of age, sex, and Alzheimer’s disease-relevant brain injury event; and, to test the efficacy of a
novel liposome-miRNA delivery method as a potential therapeutic strategy.
 To complete these objectives, we will 1) confirm that miR-223 directly targets the CEBPβ-ApoE pathway in
myeloid cells, and test whether liposome-miR-223 delivery affects this pathway; 2) test the miR-223-CEBPβ-
ApoE pathway using a brain injury mouse model and target the pathway using the liposome miRNA delivery
system in a novel miR-223 knockout mouse; 3) evaluate the miR-223-CEBPβ-ApoE pathway in human cells in
parallel with neuropathological changes of Alzheimer’s disease. These studies will include assessments of
brain tissue from the world-class University of Kentucky Alzheimer’s Disease Center biobank.
 Completion of the funded studies will extend our understanding of mechanisms regulating
inflammation/ApoE pathways in the context of sex, aging, and brain injury, ultimately advancing treatments for
Alzheimer’s disease. Filling these knowledge gaps could have a lasting impact on public health. Moreover, our
innovative miRNA-based therapeutic strategy targeting miR-223 provides a proof of efficacy for a new drug
target, particularly in females, who are vulnerable for diseases associated with neuroinflammation and ApoE
dysregulation, including Alzheimer’s disease and other brain injury."
10849866,"This revised competitive renewal application is submitted under the NIH multiple PI initiative
(http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-11-118.html). Drs. Ed Sherwood and David Williams
will serve as the PIs. The multiple PI strategy is advantageous because it enables a “team science” approach
that will draw equally on the expertise and experience of both of the PIs, their research groups and their
respective institutions. The critically ill patient frequently develops a complex disease spectrum that may
include acute respiratory distress syndrome, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis syndrome,
septic shock and/or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. In the United States ~951,000 patients/year develop
sepsis with approximately half of these patients in the ICU and an overall mortality rate is 28.6%. Those
patients that survive the initial septic event may ultimately succumb to widespread organ dysfunction that can
be either acute, due to hyper-inflammatory responses, or more prolonged due to immune dysfunction. It is well
accepted that sepsis causes suppression of the immune system and that sepsis-induced immunoparalysis
predisposes the critically ill patient to secondary infections. Attempts at developing effective therapies to
prevent or treat sepsis and its associated immunosuppression have proven to be exceedingly difficult. In fact,
no drugs are currently approved by the FDA for the management of sepsis. Recent data have provided
compelling evidence that the innate immune system can be “trained” to respond more rapidly and effectively to
pathogens. In this revised application, we propose the novel concept that it may be possible to “train” the
compromised immune system, such that an effective response can be mounted to existing and/or subsequent
infections. We hypothesize that “innate immune training will reprogram the metabolic, transcriptomic,
epigenomic and functional phenotype of monocytes and macrophages from patients with sepsis and
confer augmented resistance to infection”. To critically evaluate this hypothesis, we propose the following
specific aims. Aim 1. Define the functional role of β-glucan-induced metabolic reprogramming for
inducing and sustaining trained immunity in human monocytes and macrophages. In this aim, we will
explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms that are essential for induction of the trained phenotype.
Specifically, we will investigate the metabolic phenotype of trained human monocyte/macrophages and
determine the functional importance of metabolic reprogramming for inducing and sustaining the trained
phenotype in leukocytes. Aim 2. Elucidate the mechanisms of innate immune training in human adults as
a function of age. In this aim, we will examine the impact of immune training on leukocytes from aging
humans. In ex vivo experiments, we will examine cytokine secretion, metabolic reprogramming, gene
expression, the epigenome, mitochondrial function and the anti-microbial functions of human monocytes and
macrophages in response to immune training. Aim 3. Examine the effect of immune training in leukocytes
isolated from sepsis patients. In this aim, we will employ monocytes or monocyte derived macrophages from
sepsis patients. We will examine the effect of immune training on metabolic reprogramming, gene expression,
the epigenome, mitochondrial activity and functionality of human monocytes and macrophages from septic
patients. Successful completion of this research will provide a wealth of new and novel information on the
mechanisms driving trained immunity in the presence and absence of sepsis. Of greater significance, this
research will investigate innate immune training as a strategy for preventing and/or ameliorating sepsis and
septic sequelae in the critically ill patient."

10870065,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 4
 We propose to leverage our state-of-the-art expertise in theoretical biological physics and computational
fluid dynamics to investigate fundamental aspects of the pial neurovascular circuit and its impact upon cortical
blood supply and oxygenation. Project 4 will provide a quantitative path from in vivo responses in animal
subjects (Projects 1 and 2) to the interpretation of fMRI data across human subjects (Project 3). This program
will establish a link between observable neurovascular responses and the internal brain state. In particular,
Project 4 will collaborate with Project 1 to integrate experimental knowledge of pial neurovascular circuit
oscillations; it will collaborate with Project 2 to incorporate knowledge on the modulation of neuronal and
vascular activity; finally, it will impact Project 3 by using blood oxygenation models to determine BOLD fMRI
signals in response to pial neurovascular patterns.
 Project 4 features two specific aims: (ii) Capture the spatiotemporal neurovascular dynamics and the
patterns of the pial vascular network, that is, the dilation and constriction of arterioles driven by their smooth
muscle sheath; and (ii) Demonstrate the effects of the vasomotor dynamics onto the cortical blood supply and
tissue pO2, thereby establishing a causal link between BOLD/CBV fMRI signals and neuronal activity patterns.
 For Aim 1, we shall rely on long standing experimental evidence for ultraslow, ~ 0.1 Hz oscillations of
individual arteriole segments, as well as preliminary data of Project 1 on the pial neurovascular network. Their
combination leads to our theoretical framework of brain arterioles forming a network of coupled oscillators that
control the flow of blood throughout the entire brain. Our first goal is to develop coupled-oscillator-based
mathematical models that capture the essence of the observed neurovascular and neuromodulatory dynamics
across the cortical mantle and propose experimental tests. Our second goal is to demonstrate how the
competition between modulatory drives and intrinsic oscillations of arterioles results in spatial parcellation and
formation of the different constellations of temporally coherent regions, as observed in Projects 1 to 3.
 For Aim 2, we will use detailed hemodynamic simulations with an existing three dimensional reconstruction
of the cortical microcirculation to gauge the regulatory effect of vasomotor actuation, modeled in the first aim
and observed in experiments of Projects 1 and 2, on induced changes in cortical blood and oxygen supply.
The effects of rhythmic changes in pial arteriole diameter upon the cerebral blood flow and dynamic resistance
redistributions in microvessels will be specifically dissected to establish the feed forward regulation that
vasomotor exercises upon cortical blood supply and tissue pO2. Vasomotor-modulated blood flow will be
further used to compute spatiotemporal oxygenation maps throughout the depth of cortical layers and across
the pial surface. Those maps will provide the link between the dynamics of oxygenation and the pial network,
which will inform our inferences of the brain state and neuromodulatory inputs from BOLD fMRI signals."
10863943,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION / ABSTRACT
Unhealthy changes in the gut microbiota might trigger the pathogenesis of many diseases. We have reported
that priming the gut by -glucan-shaped microbiota, prior to clinical disease onset, can profoundly suppress
autoimmune and colitis severity. Accumulating evidence suggests that microbes and their metabolites critically
modulate the pathophysiology of various diseases. However, vast majority of microbial metabolites including
those resulting from microbiota-diet interaction remain unknown and/or uncharacterized. Non-digestible,
microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) including -glucans are thought to have major impact on microbiota
composition and function. Our findings show that high-pure -glucans (BGs) from yeast (yeast -1,3/1,6-glucan;
YBG) and microalgae (algal -1,3-glucan; paramylon, PM): a) have prebiotic properties, b) can increase the
intestinal production of SCFA, c) can enhance gut integrity, and d) can suppress autoimmune progression and
gut inflammation. However, to fully explain the mechanisms associated with the host-benefits of BG-shaped
microbiota and to develop nutraceutical approaches, it is important to identify metabolites generated from BG-
like CDP degradation and characterize their functional impacts. In this regard, our observations from in vitro and
in vivo studies suggest that “BG-degradation” by gut microbes produces a distinct metabolite profile that includes
the higher abundance of immune regulatory SCFAs. Therefore, we hypothesize that “identification and functional
characterization of unique microbial metabolites of BG-degradation could lead to the development of precision-
nutrition and -medicine approaches to enhance gut and systemic immune regulation”.
Here, in response to PAR-21-253, we have proposed to, first identify BG degradation- and autoimmunity-
associated novel microbial metabolites. Our studies will focus on i) determining if BG degradation, by human
fecal microbiota, produces a distinct metabolite profile and ii) identifying the novel microbial metabolites of this
process. We will also examine if fecal microbes from autoimmune type 1 diabetes and systemic lupus
erythematosus patients produce pro-inflammatory metabolites and determine if BG-degradation process skews
this pro-inflammatory metabolite profile to immune regulatory type. The pro- and anti- inflammatory properties of
BG degradation- and autoimmunity-associated microbial metabolites will be studied in a series of in vitro and in
vivo studies. The functional impacts of candidate metabolites on T-, B- and dendritic- cell responses will also be
studied. We will then examine if in vivo immune function and autoimmune disease outcomes can be modulated
by select microbial metabolites. Overall, these studies will demonstrate if fermentation of BG-like MACs
generates microbial metabolites with therapeutic value, in terms of preventing and/or treating immune mediated
disorders. We will work closely with the Knowledgebase Management Center (KMC) for different aspects of the
project and share data and experimental details freely with KMC and other grantees."
10818572,"Summary Statement
Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) represents a pressing public health problem in
African Americans. This disease is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in these
individuals. POAG affects African Americans more severely at earlier ages, contributing
to younger generations with vision loss and adverse health and economic outcomes.
Current pressure-lowering treatments for the disease have mixed success, with
approximately 30% of patients still experiencing vision loss. POAG is a familial disease
and there is a need for large genetic studies that elucidate disease mechanisms. This
need is especially pronounced in African Americans, who, despite their increased
burden of disease, remain seriously understudied. In its initial funding phase, the
Primary Open-Angle African American Glaucoma Genetics (POAAGG) study addressed
this disparity by conducting the largest-ever POAG genetics study on African Americans
recruited from a single city. For this renewal, we will study genetic data from a genome-
wide association study of 7765 subjects and whole-exome sequencing of 8082 subjects,
as well as rich phenotypic data on >90% of POAG cases. The proposed renewal will
allow us to further investigate and identify variants of biologic importance to African
American POAG. The aims of this study are: 1) to conduct post-GWAS analyses on
genome-wide significant variants from the POAAGG study to elucidate their role in this
disease, 2) to identify additional regions of interest for African American POAG through
whole-exome and structural genomics analyses, and 3) to evaluate the functional
impact of regions of interest in cellular model systems. Our findings will begin to define
relevant biologic pathways for African American POAG, which can potentially provide
targets for population screening and precision therapeutics."
10772163,"The overarching hypothesis underpinning our research is that inter-individual differences in asthma control
result from the interplay of genetic and environmental factors organized in discrete molecular networks. During
the first grant cycle, we explored this hypothesis by defining the molecular determinants of asthma control in
well characterized patient populations using integrative genomic approaches. Among our most notable
observations was our discovery that asthmatics with suboptimal asthma control demonstrate a peripheral blood
gene expression signature indicative of activation of the TREM1 signaling pathway. Triggering Receptor
Expressed On Myeloid Cells 1 (TREM1) is a cell-surface receptor expressed on monocytes and macrophages
that plays a critical role in modulating both the innate and adaptive immune response. We now hypothesize
that the activation of TREM1 is a critical early molecular event in the worsening of asthma control, and that
inhibition of this signaling pathway represents new and effective non-steroidal strategy for maintaining long-
term asthma control. We will test these hypotheses in the following complementary Specific Aims: In Specific
Aim 1 we will use both single cell and bulk RNA-sequencing to characterize the patterns of TREM1 expression
and pathway activation in monocyte subtypes from 100 children and young adults with variable asthma control.
Our goals are to define and classify monocyte subsets based on their TREM1 activation status; correlate
monocyte-specific TREM1 activation signatures with asthma control; and assess whether these signatures can
predict deterioration in asthma control and exacerbation. In Specific Aim 2 we will evaluate soluble TREM1
(sTREM1) as a potential biomarker of asthma control. sTREM1 is shed from cell surfaces and plasma sTREM1
levels correlate with clinical severity in several inflammatory conditions. We will measure sTREM1 plasma
levels in samples from more than 2,500 asthmatics to determine (i) if sTREM1 can serve as a biomarker of
asthma control and predict asthma exacerbation; (ii) if high sTREM1 levels define a specific clinical asthma
subtype or responsiveness to specific asthma therapies; and (iii) if sTREM1 levels are determined by specific
genetic or environmental exposures, and, if so, do they mediate correlations with asthma control? In Specific
Aim 3, we will use an established mouse model of allergic airway inflammation to evaluate the therapeutic
potential of inhibition of the TREM1 signaling pathway in the treatment of asthma. We anticipate that LR12 will
demonstrate strong efficacy in these models, providing essential pre-clinical data to support future first-in-
human trials of this compound in asthmatic patients."

Low back pain afflicts up to 80% of Americans and accounts for over $100 billion in healthcare and social costs
annually. While intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration and injury have been strongly associated with low back
pain, the causation between pathoanatomical features of the IVD and clinical presentation of low back pain
remains poorly understood. Recent rodent work show that axial low back pain symptoms can be recapitulated
by the targeted injury of the lumbar intervertebral disc. The injury evokes a degenerative sequala in the IVD
and produces neurite infiltration that are associated with chronic behavioral symptoms of axial low back pain.
This is corroborated by human studies that observed increased innervation in degenerated IVD from humans.
Thus, understanding the molecular events that drives IVD innervation may provide insights to therapeutic
opportunities prior to the transition to chronic LBP symptoms. The proliferation of sensory nerves is tightly
regulated by Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and Vascular Endothelial Growth A (VEGFA). NGF serves critical
homeostatic functions in neurons, while VEGFA plays a crucial role in spontaneous neurite extension and
dendritic outgrowth in connective tissues, in addition to initiating angiogenesis. Degenerate and injured IVD
cells express VEGFa as a part of the inflammatory cascade, but the mechanistic effects of VEGFA on
neoinnervation in the IVD and subsequent low back pain behavior have not been investigated.
 The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the ablation of VEGFA attenuates neurite growth
and vascularization into the injured IVD and alleviates ensuing low back pain symptoms. We will
investigate the hypotheses through the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Determine whether the deletion
of VEGFA 2-days after injury prevents IVD innervation and vascularization, and low back pain symptoms 3-
and 12- weeks following a targeted injury. Specific Aim 2: Determine whether the deletion of VEGFA 6-weeks
after injury slows, arrests, or reverses IVD innervation and vascularization, and low back pain symptoms 12-
weeks following a targeted injury.
 The mechanistic understanding of VEGFA’s role in modifying the pathoanatomy will pave the way as a
disease modifying therapy for low back pain. The ease for delivery anti-VEGF therapies makes it an attractive
candidate for the diseased IVD, and anti-VEGFA has already been approved for the treatment of macular
degeneration and cancer in humans. The proof-of-concept work here will also lay the foundation for future
studies to investigate the source of VEGFA by utilizing tissue-specific drivers of CreERT2; the VEGF crosstalk
between intervertebral disc, endothelial cells, and sensory neurons; and leveraging these chronic low back
pain mechanisms as potential therapies."

outflow pathway contains several tissues. From upstream to downstream of aqueous humor outflow, the
tissues can be divided into proximal outflow tissues including the TM and Schlemm’s canal, as well as distal
outflow tissues including the collector channel and aqueous vein. The importance of the distal flow tissue is not
clear in glucocorticoid-induced OHT/glaucoma. Therefore, we will study our hypothesis that the distal outflow
tissue, like the TM, also responds differentially to glucocorticoids and this response contributes to OHT. Our
goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of glucocorticoid-induced OHT. We propose two specific aims.
SA1. Determine if distal outflow tissues differentially regulate outflow resistance in GIG. Using our new
perfusion culture model, we will perfuse paired human donor corneal rims in two study groups. Group a: Both
rims will have the TM removed using the Kahook dual blade. One rim will be perfused with 0.1% ethanol
(EtOH) as a vehicle control and the fellow rim with 100nM dexamethasone (DEX) for 7-10 days. IOP will be
recorded and compared between eyes. At least 50 pairs of corneal rims will be studied. This group is used to
determine if the distal outflow tissue is able to cause glucocorticoid-induced OHT. Group b: One rim will be
perfused directly, while the fellow rim will have the TM tissue removed and then perfused. Both rims will be
treated with DEX for 7-10 days and IOP will be recorded. At least 50 pairs of corneal rims will be studied. This
group is used to determine if the distal outflow tissue is as important as the proximal tissue in glucocorticoid-
induced OHT. SA2. Compare spatial gene expression between proximal and distal outflow tissues in
GIG. Paired corneal rims with or without TM will be perfused with EtOH in one rim and DEX in the fellow rim.
Both rims will be used for spatial gene expression studies. Tissues will be fixed and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin to identify the outflow structure/region. Identified regions will be mounted on a chip on a slide. The
chip contains 5000 bar-coded spots containing oligonucleotides for the capture, amplification, and identification
of tissue RNA for RNA sequencing. The resolution of the chip is sufficient to study both proximal and distal
outflow tissues. Both responder and non-responder tissues will be studied and compared. The results will be
validated using in situ hybridization and immunostaining. Our project is novel because we will use the new
corneal rim perfusion culture model and spatial gene expression technology. This study is significant because
it will provide a novel treatment target, the distal outflow tissue, for treating glucocorticoid induced glaucoma."

Understanding the mechanisms underlying GPCR signaling is crucial in order to fully comprehend their role in
physiology and pathophysiology. In addition to canonical second messengers (cAMP, cGMP and IP3) and β-
arrestin signaling, small GTPase proteins, such as Rho GTPases are largely involved in GPCR-mediated signal
transduction. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) convert Rho GTPases from an inactive (GDP-bound)
state to an active state (GTP-bound). Rho-GEFs can be activated by Gq, G12/13 and Gs proteins. However,
currently there is no evidence that Gi/0-WT can directly activate RhoGEFs. PDZ domains are structural protein
domains that recognize simple linear amino acid motifs often at the protein C-terminal (C-motif). RhoA, activated
by PDZ-RhoGEFs, has important signaling roles, by activating phospholipase D (PLD) and transcription factors.
Cannabinoid receptor CB1, an abundantly expressed GPCR that mainly couples to Gi/o, has a EAL C-motif (last
three amino acids) that binds PDZ class III proteins, including PDZ-RhoGEF. Our central hypothesis is that CB1
receptor activation, in addition to engaging cAMP inhibition and β-arrestin pathways, initiates an additional
signaling mechanism downstream to PDZ-RhoGEF leading to activation of RhoA and subsequent activation of
PLD. Activation of PLD generates two distinct second messengers, phosphatidic acid, which activates the mTOR
pathway, and choline, which activates Sigma1 receptors. We will use a multidisciplinary approach, combining
state-of-the-art molecular and pharmacological approaches for a comprehensive investigation of the signaling
pathways elicited by activation of C-motifs of CB1 receptor and identification of pathways-selective ligands. We
will use receptor and PDZ-RhoGEF mutations, measurements of second messengers levels (cAMP, choline and
phosphatidic acid) as well as live imaging of PLD activation. We provide solid preliminary results supporting the
feasibility of the project and the ability of our team to complete the work proposed. The project has two aims:
Aim 1. Investigate the role of PDZ-binding domain in CB1-induced signaling; experiments are designed to
characterize intracellular cascades activated by CB1-motifs (CB1-PDZ binding domain. Aim 2. Investigate the
role of PDZ-RhoGEF/RhoA pathway in CB1 receptor signaling in cultured primary neurons and in vivo. The
successful completion of this project will increase the current knowledge of GPCR signaling and will serve as a
basis for further development of ligands selectively targeting this pathway."

Facial perception and memory are visual abilities that are driven by an interplay between low-level visual and
higher-level cognitive functioning. Deﬁcits in facial perception and memory are associated with diminished quality
of life and a range of social challenges, and it has been suggested that this functional deﬁcit may be an early
marker for the later onset of structural abnormalities in a variety of conditions. One of these conditions—one that
has received scant attention—is diabetic retinopathy. In a recent systematic review, difﬁculty in perceiving faces
was noted as one of the greatest subjective restrictions on visual functioning. Diabetic retinopathy affects approx-
imately one-third of individuals with diabetes world-wide. The vision loss associated with diabetic retinopathy is
preventable, given early identiﬁcation, medical intervention and monitoring, and behavioral interventions. Diabetic
retinopathy can be generally separated into two classes. The ﬁrst is non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, which
is characterized by micro-aneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, venous beading or intra-retinal microvascular ab-
normalities. The second is proliferative diabetic retinopathy, which is characterized by retinal neovascularization.
In cases of macular edema, there is a thickening of the macula which can result in the loss of central vision.
 Deﬁcits in face processing have been studied more frequently in two pathologies that affect the macula: age-
related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucomatous macular damage. Patients with AMD regularly identify
facial processing as tasks with which they experience signiﬁcant difﬁculty. In the literature on AMD, deﬁcits in
facial processing have been identiﬁed as signiﬁcant components of quality of life. The magnitude of the deﬁcits
in facial processing in AMD are such that they are second only to deﬁcits in reading in subjective complaints.
Finally, it has been noted that deﬁcits in facial processsing are among the ﬁrst subjectively-reported symptoms
of AMD, often occurring before the detection of structural abnormalities. With respect to deﬁcits in facial percep-
tion and memory in glaucomatous macular damage, there is evidence that signiﬁcant impairments exist despite
patients having good central visual acuity. In addition, the amount of the diffuse macular damage is signiﬁcantly
related to impairments in contrast sensitivity and measures of facial recognition and identiﬁcation. It has been
suggested that other related visual pathologies—including diabetic retinopathy—should show similar patterns of
performance deﬁcits. However, very little work on this issue has been done in the case of diabetic retinopa-
thy. The work proposed here represents an important ﬁrst step in addressing this need. The accomplishment
of this work will result in the ﬁrst quantiﬁcation of the prevalence and severity of deﬁcits in facial processing in
diabetic retinopathy, the ﬁrst analytic empirical treatment of the pathology-related differences in processing feat-
ural and conﬁgural information, and the ﬁrst theoretical treatment of those differences. The novel application of
two meta-theories using a new experimental design, along with a modeling approach capable of relating those
meta-theories has the potential to be transformative in this domain."
10812473,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One of central functions of neuromodulation is to adjust the internal representations of sensory information ac-
cording to the internal states of an individual. In particular, chemosensation can have dramatically different bio-
logical meanings depending on the nutritional state. For instance, the smell of food not only informs an animal
where the food is, but also how valuable it is. According to nutritional need, an animal uses the perceived value
of the food as a context to adjust the level of competition with other conspecifics. While hunger is known to
change the detection thresholds of olfactory and gustatory sensory neurons through neuromodulation, how the
nervous system uses chemosensory cues as contextual information for social behaviors remains largely un-
known. The long-term goal of this research program is to characterize the neuropeptidergic modulation of
chemosensory circuits by deconstructing this physiological process into clearly defined, behaviorally relevant
molecular and neuronal events. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is ideal for achieving this goal. As a ge-
netically tractable model organism, the fly allows precise control of neuronal populations with defined behav-
ioral functions and genes involved in neuromodulation. During the previous funding period, the functions of
tachyninergic neuromodulatory microcircuits that control aggressive behavior were comprehensively character-
ized at the molecular and circuit levels. Building upon our expertise with Drosophila genetics and social behav-
ior, the proposed project will characterize how the fly nervous system uses peptidergic neuromodulation to
transform a food-derived odor into a cue to adjust the level of aggression. The three specific aims, each sup-
ported by successful preliminary studies, are to: (1) characterize neuropeptidergic cells that convert protein
deficit into altered representations of chemical stimuli, (2) characterize molecular and circuit mechanisms of
hugin neuromodulation, and (3) determine specific chemosensory pathways that mediate food-odor-driven ag-
gression. In Aim 1, the neuropeptide-releasing cells that mediate the promotion of aggressive behavior in pro-
tein-deprived flies will be identified, and their function for encoding the nutritional state will be behaviorally
characterized. In Aim 2, functions of neuropeptides and their cognate receptors in the midgut and in the brain
will be characterized through genetic, physiological, and behavioral approaches. In Aim 3, the specific class of
olfactory sensory neurons that detect key volatile compounds emitted from yeast, and the neural node in the
olfactory pathway that are modulated by above-mentioned neuropeptides, will be characterized. The results
from the proposed experiments will uncover the fundamental role of peptidergic neuromodulation in transform-
ing olfactory information into a behaviorally important environmental context. Neuromodulation is important for
encoding the hunger state across animal species, and many neuropeptides involved in hunger control are evo-
lutionarily conserved. Knowledge obtained through this project may lead to a better understanding of the neural
basis of hunger-dependent changes in olfactory perception in humans."
10897259,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Telomeres, the ends of human chromosomes, shorten every time a cell divides. When telomeres become too
short, human cells stop dividing or undergo programmed cell death. Telomerase adds telomeric DNA onto
chromosome ends to counteract telomere shortening. In the human body telomerase is expressed in stem cells,
allowing them to continuously proliferate throughout our lives. Defects in telomerase function lead to premature
aging diseases such as Dyskeratosis Congenita, which are caused by the depletion of stem cell populations. In
addition, telomerase is expressed in ~90% of tumors and allows cancer cells to proliferate indefinitely. It is
therefore critical to develop targeted approaches to promote or interfere with telomerase activity to treat
premature aging diseases and cancer, respectively. Telomerase is a complex ribonucleoprotein that contains
the telomerase reverse transcriptase protein (TERT), the telomerase RNA (TR), and various co-factors including
the telomerase cajal body protein 1 (TCAB1). TCAB1 is required for telomerase function in human cells but the
mechanism underlying its contribution to telomere maintenance is controversial. Initially it was suggested that
telomerase is properly assembled and fully active in the absence of TCAB1, leading to the model that TCAB1 is
required for telomerase trafficking to telomeres. More recent observations suggest that TCAB1 is required for
telomerase catalytic activity by promoting TR folding without affecting overall RNP assembly. Importantly, all
previous studies clearly demonstrate that TR is enriched in nucleoli in cells lacking TCAB1. Our prior work has
shown that TERT is specifically excluded from nucleoli. We therefore believe that in the absence of TCAB1,
telomerase fails to assemble because TR is trapped in nucleoli and TERT is excluded from nucleoli. Both nucleoli
and Cajal bodies are phase separated nuclear organelles. Phase separation is an emerging molecular
phenomenon by which proteins and nucleic acids from liquid like droplets. In preliminary experiments we have
shown that TCAB1 contains disordered regions that can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation. Our central
hypothesis is that the specific phase separation properties of TCAB1 facilitate telomerase assembly by driving
the exclusion of the telomerase RNA from nucleoli and promoting its interaction with Cajal bodies. To test this
hypothesis, we will address the following specific aims, (1) Determine the role of TCAB1 in telomerase assembly,
and (2) Define the phase separation properties of TCAB1 and dissect their contribution to telomerase assembly."
10886547,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human microbiome is an underappreciated contributor to drug disposition and treatment outcomes,
supported by associations in human cohorts, controlled studies in preclinical models, and high-throughput in
vitro screens. However, despite considerable recent progress in this emerging area of study there are still
major gaps in knowledge regarding the fundamental mechanisms through which human gut microbes impact
pharmacology. Research in the Turnbaugh lab over the past 5 years (supported by 1R01HL122593-01A1) was
focused on understanding the role of the prevalent human gut Actinobacterium Eggerthella lenta in drug
metabolism and disposition. While we began by focusing on the gut bacterial inactivation of the cardiac drug
digoxin, used to treat heart failure and cardiac arrythmias, our results together with the broader scientific
literature have further implicated E. lenta as a key bacterial species for the metabolism of diverse drugs,
dietary small molecules, and host metabolites. We established a robust comparative genomics toolkit for
studying E. lenta that could be readily extended to other genetically intractable gut bacterial species. In the
coming years we will continue to leverage E. lenta as a test case, with a focus on two general challenges at the
interface of microbiome research and pharmacology. In Aim 1, we will study the endogenous substrates for gut
bacterial enzymes involved in drug metabolism, building on the surprising observation that the same enzyme
responsible for digoxin metabolism is also necessary and sufficient to activate pro-inflammatory Th17 cells in
the murine gut, exacerbating mouse models of colitis. Then, in Aim 2, we will determine the mechanism
through which E. lenta inhibits the activity of the key intestinal drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, providing
the first step towards a more comprehensive view of the role of the microbiome in drug disposition that
accounts for microbiome-dependent changes in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination. Together,
these studies emphasize the utility and feasibility of hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies, meant to
complement the wealth of data from large-scale clinical cohort studies and high-throughput screens. Our
results have already provided multiple insights that both inform and complicate our model of how the
microbiome impacts drugs, emphasizing the numerous challenges that lie ahead prior to translating this work
to achieve our long-term goal of microbiome-based precision medicine."

There are more than 100k American waiting for a kidney transplant, but demand far exceeds supply. Ex vivo organogenesis is a potential source for functional tissue for renal replacement therapy. We and others established techniques to generate cellularly complex kidney organoids from human induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs). Theoretically, iPSC-derived renal organoids would be grafted to host tissue and would integrate with vascular and urinary systems to supplement lost kidney function. However, data indicates that implanted organoids integrate poorly with the host kidney. Based on experimental observations, we identified at least 3 key obstacles that must be overcome to generate integrated renal organoids (Fig. 1):
Tissue organization: Organoid tubules, blood vessels, and stroma lack cortico-medullary pattern.
Tubular fusion: With current strategies, organoid tubules and vessels do not anastomose with host tissues.
Functional assays: We lack assays to identify successful renal replacement by organoid tissue.
The goal of our collaborative team is to generate the tools, reagents and protocols to overcome each of these obstacles. In our recent studies, we discovered the following: 1) Distinct stromal cell populations are required to establish correct zonal organization and segment-specific differentiation of tubules and vasculature; 2) Organoids lack a normal distribution and complement of stromal cell populations; 3) Stromal cells and their secreted products can facilitate tubule-tubule interconnection. These findings show that formation of renal organoids that are appropriately patterned for in vivo function depends on creating the correct complement and organization of stromal cells. The concept that anatomically “correct” tissue that is matched to the engraftment site can be generated through manipulation of stromal cell populations is novel and identifies a gap in our understanding of stromal cell biology of developing kidney tissue. To fill this gap and generate resources to determine how this novel patterning mechanism can be exploited to generate kidney tissue for renal replacement, we propose a series of hypothesis-generating investigations that will define the roles of diverse stromal cells in patterning the vasculature and renal epithelium as well as promoting tubular connection to the host. Our longterm goal is to generate functional proximal nephrons with appropriately patterned microvasculature that integrate with the host urinary and circulatory systems for functional renal replacement.
To facilitate our efforts to promote tubule and vascular fusion, we will develop a pipeline for in vivo testing of laboratory-derived tissue in animals with impaired kidney function. In preliminary data, we demonstrate novel functional assays including ELISAs and live imaging of tubular fluid flow that can rapidly and easily assess the contribution of implanted organoids to host urine production. We will also generate novel resources, including stromal cell lines, reporter mice, imaging technology, and assays to quantify the extent of renal replacement by organoid tissue. We propose the following Aims:
 Aim 1: Develop strategies to modulate organoid stroma to promote proximal nephron segments 1A. Develop protocols to promote formation of proximal tubule stroma.
1B. Investigate the role of macrophages in organoid differentiation.
Aim 2. Generate robust and functionally regionalized renal vasculature in tissue grafts 2A. Evaluate vascular maintenance, growth, and recruitment in organoids.
2B. Characterize stromal impact on organoid vasculature.
2C. Generate “vascular-primed” organoids.
Aim 3. Identify strategies to promote tubule fusion in renal epithelia
3A. Identify the role of stromal interactions on epithelial tubule anastomosis.
3B. Determine the role of HGF and TGFß on tubule anastomosis in organoids.
Aim 4. Evaluate function of graft tissue in vivo
4A. Develop a pipeline to test functional replacement potential of graft tissue.
4B. Assess organoid engraftment in regenerative versus fibrotic kidneys.
The completion of these aims is expected to greatly advance knowledge of how stromal cell populations provide needed cues for organoid organization, vascularization and connection/engraftment. Successful completion will reveal general concepts and generate much needed resources that will propel research in this field and contribute significantly to the ultimate goal of providing functional renal replacement tissue to the vast number of patients with advanced kidney disease, a goal we believe is achievable in the next 10-20 years.

10886554,"Project Summary/Abstract
Chronic pain is a pervasive and devastating condition. Translational control is a dominant theme in synaptic
plasticity and plays a key role in pain plasticity, in particular the plasticity of peripheral nociceptors. Messenger
RNA (mRNA) is subject to dynamic regulation by signaling pathways implicated in plasticity such as the
integrated stress response (ISR) and mTOR. Yet, the identity of the mRNAs in nociceptors subjected to regulated
translation during plasticity events is virtually unknown. Here, we use an exciting new genomics method termed
ribosome profiling to gain genome-wide insight into translation control events in DRG neurons. Our preliminary
studies reveal a rapid induction of translation of a specific subset of mRNAs that are known to be involved in
neuronal plasticity in response to cytokine treatment of DRG neurons. Among them is the immediate early gene
Arc. We identify S6K as required for activity dependent translation of Arc. A chemical inhibitor of S6K attenuates
mechanical hypersensitivity in a model of inflammatory pain. Additionally, our preliminary data also indicate
evidence for translation of a specific 5’ untranslated region (UTR) reading frame encoded by Calca/CGRP. The
resulting peptide is able to promote pain amplification in vivo. In the first aim of this proposal, we will
comprehensively characterize translation regulation in DRG neurons in response to cytokines with a focus on
underlying mechanisms and targets of interest. We examine the function of a specific uORF with
electrophysiology and pharmacology. In the second aim, we examine the effects of methylglyoxal (MGO) on
translation. MGO is associated with diabetic neuropathy as well as discogenic neuropathies and our preliminary
data indicate that its pain promoting effects depend on induction of the ISR. Interestingly, the ISR induces
translation of uORFs suggesting this non-canonical form of translation as a new theme in neuropathic pain. We
will probe the effects of MGO on translational control and determine if blocking the ISR is a viable option for
neuropathic pain. Our experiments demonstrate the tremendous potential of a transformative genomics tool that
enables new views on pain plasticity with astonishing molecular clarity."
10875643,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to dramatic reductions in cancer
screening and follow-up services. During the early months of the pandemic, national organizations
recommended postponing all routine cancer screening, resulting in dramatic reductions in adult primary care
and specialty care visits; current rates remain far below pre-pandemic levels. Modeling suggests that these
reductions will result in over 57,000 missed cancer diagnoses and 10,000 excess deaths over the next
decade. However, these models are largely informed by data sources made up predominantly of insured
patients and lacking race/ethnicity information. Thus, more information is needed to understand the
strategies and resources need to support the recovery of health systems and communities that have been
most impacted by COVID-19. The effects of the pandemic on cancer screening uptake may be particularly
profound for patients served by resource-limited federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), which deliver
services a large share of patients with incomes below the federal poverty level and who are Latinx. Latinx
populations already have some of the lowest rates of cancer screening and follow-up care in the United
States and are likely to experience the largest reductions in care and slower return to normal following
COVID-19. This is, in part, because their communities have been hit particularly hard by COVID-19 (e.g.
high rates of COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations and job loss) and they may fear returning for
preventive care even when medical authorities have deemed it safe. Our proposed mixed-methods study will
estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rates of cancer screening and follow-up in patients
served by a large, diverse FQHC (Aim 1), and estimate impacts on cancer outcomes (e.g. changes in life
years gained, cancers prevented, and late-stage cancer incidence) in the FQHC population building on
models developed by the CRC-SPN Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (Aim 2). Finally,
we will gather qualitative data from clinic staff and patients to identify opportunities to improve post-pandemic
cancer preventive care delivery for adults served by FQHCs (Aim 3). There is a critical need to understand
the long-term impacts of COVID-19-care reductions on vulnerable populations and identify opportunities to
meet the ongoing cancer prevention needs of patients served by FQHCs. We will collaborate with national
stakeholders to develop FQHC-specific guidance to inform future interventions to support recovery from
COVID-like care disruptions Thus, our findings will support access to care and reduction of health disparities
for communities most impacted by COVID-19."

The protective intestinal mucosal barrier is a specialized domain responding to and
interacting with different luminal noxious substances and the microbiome. Acute gut
barrier dysfunction occurs commonly in patients with critical surgical disorders such as
trauma, thermal injury, sepsis, shock, massive surgical operations, and ischemic
postconditioning. Gut barrier dysfunction leads to the translocation of luminal toxic
substances and bacteria to the blood stream and, in some instances, results in multiple
organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death. Effective therapies to preserve gut
barrier integrity are limited, because of poorly understood mechanisms of acute gut
barrier dysfunction in various critical surgical conditions. Recently, intercellular crosstalk
directed by the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been gaining increasing
attention. EVs released from many cell types, including intestinal epithelial cells (IECs),
can transfer a variety of bioactive molecules to neighboring or distant tissues and hence
play previously unrecognized functional roles. The goal of this competitive renewal
application is to determine the role and mechanism of EV noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in
the control of intestinal barrier function under critical surgical conditions by carrying out a
series of multi-disciplinary studies. Our preliminary data indicate that the small
noncoding vault RNASs (vtRNAs) are critical transcripts present in EVs released from
IECs, and that the levels of EV vtRNAs increase in patients with sepsis and mice
exposed to septic stress. Ectopically expressed vtRNAs decrease the levels of tight
junctions and disrupt the intestinal barrier function. Mice bearing a maternal deletion of
exon 1 in the H19 gene (H19-/-) exhibit induced autophagy and decreased release of
vtRNA-enriched EVs after septic stress. Building on these exciting observations, we
now propose the paradigm-shifting hypothesis that vtRNAs in EVs secreted by IECs in
response to critical surgical stress play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute
gut barrier dysfunction, and that EV release from IECs is tightly regulated by long ncRNA
H19 and RNA-binding protein HuR via autophagy. Three specific aims are proposed to
test the hypothesis: 1) to define the roles of the vtRNA cargo of EVs generated from
human enterocytes in the regulation of intestinal barrier function during critical surgical
stress; 2) to identify novel targets of EV vtRNAs that play an important role in triggering
intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction in response to critical surgical stress; and 3) to
test if H19 and HuR regulate the formation of vtRNA-rich EVs in IECs by altering
autophagy. Completion of these specific aims will uncover novel mechanisms
underlying the pathogenesis of acute gut barrier dysfunction in patients with critical
surgical disorders. It will also shed information needed to develop new biomarkers for
deteriorating acute gut barrier dysfunction and/or MODS and to develop targeted
therapeutics to preserve gut barrier integrity."

continued participation as an NCORP in 2014 through the present. CCHS has been an
exemplary contributor to all programs, frequently recognized for high accruals,stellar data
quality and timeliness of submissions. Currently, CCHS participates in the ALLIANCE, ECOG-
ACRIN, NRG, Wake Forest and Rochester cooperative groups with approximately 80 trials
opened to accrual. Participation in CTSU and the CIRB is active and ongoing. Our catchment
area includes all of Delaware and portions of New Jersey, northeastern Maryland and
southeastern Pennsylvania. Our NCORP includes two affiliates, Beebe Health Care and
Nanticoke Memorial, both located in southern Delaware. Our communities represents a
popluation base in excess of 2 million people with extensive protocol entry potential. Under the
leadership of Gregory Masters, M.D, Principal Investigator and Kandie Dempsey, DBA, MS, RN,
OCN, Director, NCORP investigators and support professionals will continue to participate in
NCTN core committees and leadership positions. Currently, our physician researchers are
represented with appointments to 17 NCORP committees and 3 NCI Steering Committees
(Breast, Gynecological and Imaging). Our mission is to continue accruals to both treatment and
cancer control studies and to further develop Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR)
participation which will build upon the intiatives set forth with our collaboration the NCI. Every
patient at the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute (HFGCCRI) is evaluated for

10903733,"The GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy Project (GUDMAP) has been providing valuable references for the research community studying urogenital development and diseases. It is a recurring theme that rapidly advancing new technologies are instrumental in enhancing and expanding reference databases. Cross fertilization of atlas building efforts spanning various organ systems and disease types will undoubtedly boost the technology penetration across these projects. To build multi-dimensional atlases of developing urogenital organs that incorporate the latest multi-omics and spatial molecular mapping technologies, we have assembled a team with expertise both in urogenital development and multi-dimensional, multi-platform, molecular atlas building. We propose to utilize the infrastructure we developed at our institution for the NCI Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) and other large scale projects as a springboard to help effectively and efficiently propel GUDMAP to the next level with transcriptome-wide coverage, single cell level resolution, and spatial mapping with unprecedented clarity. We will take advantage of our experience in the incorporation of single nucleus (sn) RNA-seq and snATAC-seq to establish a comprehensive epigenetic and transcriptomic landscape in targeted urogenital organs and structures (lower urinary tract (LUT), selected male reproductive organs, kidney vasculature, lymphatics, and nerves) at single cell resolution (Aim 1). We will then add the spatial dimension to this molecular landscape to build 2D and 3D molecular atlases by incorporating spatial transcriptomics (ST), CODEX, and light sheet microscopy (LSM) (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will extend our study to disease models, focusing on murine models of congenital anomalies of the kidney and the urinary tract (CAKUT). With the proposed experiments, we aim at building multidimensional molecular atlases for developing urogenital organs at unprecedented cellular resolution and gene coverage with the highest efficiency possible.
Aim 1: Characterize the epigenetic and transcriptomic landscapes of developing urogenital organs with single cell omics
We will perform integrated transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling of the developing/maturing LUT, male reproductive organs, and the kidney at E16.5, NB, and 3 weeks of age. Although the focus for the kidney will be on vasculature, lymphatics, and nerves, since there is a lack of single cell omics data on most of the selected stages, our data will also help to strengthen GUDMAP data for the broadest use by the research community.
Aim 2: Construct multi-dimensional molecular atlases for developing urogenital organs using spatial transcriptomics and advanced imaging technologies
A major challenge for atlas building in biological systems has been spatially assigning large number of molecular features to the anatomical and cellular structures. We have successfully established experimental procedures and computational analyses pipelines for spatial transcriptomics, CODEX, and light sheet microscopic imaging, to map gene expression data, including transcriptome-wide data to cells and structures. We will use these technologies to analyze the developing/maturing lower urinary tract, male reproductive organs, and the kidney at E16.5, NB, and 3 weeks of age for the construction of truly multi-dimensional, multiplatform molecular atlases.
Aim 3: Building molecular atlases for key urogenital structures using murine CAKUT models with cell ablation or gene inactivation
CAKUT occurs in many different forms representing a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population. We have generated and analyzed several CAKUT murine models in the past. Building atlases of the target organs for these models will provide high resolution, spatially registered molecular references for key stages of disease initiation and progression. Moreover, such atlases will help researchers better understand normal urogenital development by knowing the tolerance of the systems and processes in dealing with various disturbances. We will use a highly reproducible murine model of CAKUT with inactivation of canonical Smad signaling in ureteral mesenchyme, causing a uniform ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction phenotype prenatally. We will use the technologies outlined in Aims 1 and 2 to build molecular atlases of the relevant structures (ureter, kidney, UPJ) at key time points and compare the atlases of defective development with those of normal development."

The death of a loved one is monumentally painful, impacting 8 million in the US annually, and is a significant
cause of psychiatric and medical morbidity, including psychiatric sequelae such as depression, anxiety,
substance abuse, and complicated grief. Research exploring the association between social loss and brain
function are sparse, and diagnostic criteria for the emerging disorders are based on symptom clusters rather
than neural or genetic abnormalities, hindering pursuits of new therapeutic targets. This highlights the need
for proper animal models for social loss to mirror the behavioral symptomology to explore the neurobiological
mechanisms. Recently, we have developed an animal model of social loss using the socially monogamous
prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster), which manifest similar behavioral symptomology and disruption to normal
mesolimbic reward pathway that occurs in social loss in humans. Our long-term goals are to dissect the
neurocircuitry of social loss (including the mesolimbic reward and corticolimbic pain pathways), define genetic
biomarkers of individual vulnerability and resiliency to social loss, and develop therapeutic intervention of
neural and behavioral symptoms that appear persistent. Our theoretical neurocircuit of social loss centers in
the limbic system, which receives dopamine (DA) signaling from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and
augments motivational state and emotional valence. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (AIM
1) Loss of specific relationship types can propagate persistent change to the functional and structural
connectivity of mesolimbic circuits; (AIM 2) Behavioral symptoms of long-term social loss are based on
disruption to DA neurotransmission and can be alleviated with photostimulation and chemical innervations
along select mesolimbic pathways; (AIM 3) Changes to the expression and activity of specific DA receptors in
mesolimbic regions are coupled to fluctuating motivational states during loss and seeking of partner-associated
cues. This contribution is significant since it will establish that several pathways targeted by photostimulation
and pharmacological approaches have the potential to regulate behavioral symptomology of social loss
through mesolimbic activity. The proposed research is innovative as it is the first systematic evaluation of
neuromodulation of the mesolimbic system during partner loss in an animal model. Insight into the
neuromodulation of social loss is impactful as it may expand diagnostic criteria for the emerging mental health
disorders beyond symptom clusters and identifies neurochemical substrates for new therapeutic targets."
10854877,"Retroviruses are obligate intracellular parasites that must integrate a copy of their viral genome (cDNA) into a host chromosome. Integration is accomplished by the retrovirus-encoded integrase (IN) that forms a catalytic complex with two viral cDNA long terminal repeat (LTR) ends, termed an intasome. Retroviral intasomes maintain a conserved intasome core that may be expanded into higher order IN multimer architectures. For example, the prototype foamy virus (PFV) intasome is a simple IN tetramer, while the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) intasomes are IN octamers. Even higher IN multimers have been reported for the lentiviruses that include HIV-1 and Maedi-Visna virus (MVV). While numerous biochemical and cellular studies have detailed retroviral integration, the assembly mechanics and cost-benefit of different multimeric IN architecture on intasome biophysical properties is a substantial knowledge gap in retrovirology. Our previous work detailed the dynamic target search, integration kinetics, DNA lesion interactions, IN domain requirements and nucleosome targeting by PFV intasomes. Real-time single molecule studies were also performed with MMTV intasomes. Several important differences were identified between the PFV tetramer and MMTV octamer intasomes including distinct target search and strand transfer kinetics as well as the ability of MMTV to form multivalent complexes on a target DNA. These observations have prompted several key questions: What are the contributors that determine IN multimeric architecture? What are the factors of IN multimeric architecture that influence target search and strand transfer? How does intasome architecture influence chromatin DNA binding and target site selection? The PFV, MMTV, RSV and MVV intasomes are convenient biophysical models for probing intasome architecture since they naturally exist as an IN tetramer, octamer or 16-mer with published structures and assembly protocols. We have found that swapping the non-conserved peptides that link the signature conserved retroviral IN protein N-terminal domain (NTD), catalytic core domain (CCD) and C-terminal domain (CTD), converts them into active intasomes with a multimeric architecture of that often mimics the donor intasome. How and why these non- conserved linker peptides influence intasome architecture is unknown. We propose to utilize multiple highly quantitative single molecule imaging tools to understand the contributions of IN multimeric architecture on retroviral mechanics with the following Specific Aims: 1.) examine IN-multimer assembly and integrase activities that distinguish intasome architectures, 2.) determine the role of intasome architecture on the dynamic interactions with defined duplex and chromatin target DNA, and 3.) determine the role of intasome architecture on targeting host chromatin features in vivo. These studies will interrogate the contributors to IN multimer architecture and intasome dynamics with the goal  of identifying new retroviral mechanics and therapeutic targets."
10884330,"A Novel VpreB1 Antibody-Drug Conjugate for the Treatment of B-Lineage Acute Lymphoblastic
Leukemia/Lymphoma
B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common malignancy in children and young adults. B-
ALL relapse is a common problem among infants, adolescents, and adults at all stages. B-ALLs that relapse
after cell-based therapies demonstrate antigen remodeling, down-regulation of targeted antigens, and lineage
switches to different types of leukemia. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to the
emergence of resistant leukemic cells are not well understood.
Nearly all B-ALL cases share a restricted repertoire of B-cell surface markers. Cell-based therapies targeting
these surface receptors unfortunately eliminate all normal B cells, causing pan B-cell ablation and immune
dysregulation. This leads to serious complications and the risk of death due to infection in a significant fraction
of people who have suffered multiple relapses. To improve patient safety, our project addresses the problems
of relapse, opportunistic infections, and organ toxicities in B-ALL.
The pre-B-cell receptor (pre-BCR) autonomously signals to carry developing B-cells through the pro- and pre-B
stages of differentiation. B-ALL is usually arrested at the pro- and pre-B stages of differentiation, where these
cells are subject to pre-BCR-mediated autonomous signaling, survival, and clonal expansion. We hypothesize
that our novel VpreB1 ADC against the pre-BCR will de-couple the pathways that allows leukemia cells to
survive and become resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Therapies like the one we are developing have
lots of toxicities, including side effects that harm liver cells and the cells of the immune system that makes
antibodies against infectious diseases.
Better immunotherapies can lead to less organ damage, reduce opportunistic infections, and directly target the
resistance mechanisms that lead to residual disease in B-ALL. No current B-ALL immunotherapies target
autonomous survival signaling. This project is being expressly developed to benefit children, who have unique
physiologies and toxicity profiles. By using an AcBut-Calicheamicin linker and payload, we will gain insight into
safety data that have been collected by the Children’s Oncology Group for children receiving similar linker-toxin
payloads. Our approach is responsive to the FDA’s Best Pharmaceuticals Act of 2017, which calls for new
drugs for children and young adults who face life-threatening diseases, including B-ALL in relapse or with high-
risk disease at diagnosis.
In summary and in response to PAR-20-292, our proposal describes the development of a novel biologic
agent, with strategies to mitigate treatment-related toxicities for children and young adults who require
treatment for B-ALL.
In this proposal, we will:
 Continue the developmental trajectory of a novel ADC to address the problems of relapse, opportunistic
infections, and other toxicities in the treatment of B-ALL;
 Evaluate how well our novel ADC targets residual disease in treatment-resistant B-ALL;
 Assess the survival and adverse drug effects of our ADC, especially its effect on organ toxicities and
infectious complications;
 Evaluate how well our novel ADC spares adaptive immunity in B-ALL."

This K23 Career Development Award will provide early career support for the investigation of behavioral and
biological risk factors for HIV/STI transmission caused by methamphetamine (MA) use among men who have
sex with men (MSM). This K23 award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the
following areas: 1) Biological impacts of MA use and addiction medicine; 2) Clinical trials methods and
biobehavioral interventions; 3) Applied immunology; 4) Professional development; and 5) Responsible conduct
of research. Dr. Blair will be mentored by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in addiction, infectious
diseases, immunology, and statistics. Dr. Steven Shoptaw has an extensive track record in addiction research
and training of future independent investigators. Dr. Jesse Clark will provide mentorship in clinical trial
methods, operations, and safety procedures; Dr. Grace Aldrovandi will provide mentorship in applied
immunology, with an emphasis on mucosal immunology; and Dr. Robert Weiss will provide mentoring in
advanced statistical methods. MA use is an important driver of HIV transmission and the burgeoning STI
epidemic among MSM. Understanding the interaction of biological and behavioral risk factors for HIV/STI
transmission caused by MA use is imperative for effective HIV/STI interventions. Dr. Blair proposes to
investigate the joint effects of MA use, HIV, sexual risk behavior, and rectal gonorrhea/chlamydia (GC/CT) on
systemic and rectal inflammation. Stored plasma specimens and behavioral data obtained every 6 months over
2 years from 140 MSM will be used to assess the joint effects of HIV and MA use on systemic inflammation
and risk behavior using a 2x2 factorial design stratified by HIV serostatus (70 positive; 70 negative) and results
of urine MA screening (70 with MA use; 70 without MA use). 40 HIV-negative MA-using MSM (20 with rectal
GC/CT; 20 without rectal GC/CT) will be recruited separately from a community-based university research
clinic. MA exposure will be manipulated using contingency management (CM) to evaluate the effects of a
decline in MA use on biological markers of inflammation (e.g., cytokines). Following initiation of CM, sexual risk
behaviors will be assessed weekly for 8 weeks. Inflammatory rectal cytokines will be measured weekly with
rectal swabs and linked with biomarkers of MA exposure over 8 weeks. These activities will accomplish the
following aims: 1) Measure the joint effects of HIV and MA use on systemic cytokine concentrations and risk
behavior; 2) Identify the effects of MA exposure and concomitant rectal GC/CT on rectal cytokine
concentrations; and 3) Evaluate the association of MA use frequency with sexual risk behavior in the setting of
rectal inflammation. Through this K23 Career Development Award, Dr. Blair will establish herself as an
independent clinician-investigator with expertise in intersectional research on the biological and behavioral
impacts of MA and other drugs on HIV/STI transmission dynamics."

Communicating about anatomical concepts and patient-specific anatomy is fundamental to medicine.
Anatomy of the head and face (craniofacial anatomy) is complex, and facial morphology varies within
and among populations. Orofacial clefts—which are among the most common congenital anomalies—
display a range of severities and may be preset at more than one site.
 There is a need to communicate rapidly and accurately about craniofacial anatomy in clinical
practice, medical education, and when using clinical data in research. To address this challenge, we
propose to create simple, standardized graphics of craniofacial anatomy and phenotypes. Our collections
of graphics, or “graphic libraries”, will serve as complements to textual representations and will be
designed for use within clinical, research, and educational software applications. Our approach to
designing the graphics is based on four requirements: that the graphics be composable, extensible,
identifiable, and created using scalable vector graphics (SVGs).
 We will first develop graphics for adult and developmental anatomy, then for phenotype variations
and malformations. We will also develop prototypes for two web-based tools—one that incorporates
graphics into the Human Phenotype Ontology and the other for documenting craniofacial phenotypes
and malformations in clinical settings. By offering a new paradigm for communicating about anatomy, our
graphic libraries will become crucial components of the next generation of software applications for
clinical practice, research, and education."

Depression is a highly prevalent mental health disorder that affects millions of people in the US and causes significant
impacts on well-being, rates of disability and health care costs. Despite these substantial impacts and costs, the
effectiveness of current therapeutical options for the treatment of depression is limited. In recent years there have been
efforts to develop deep-brain stimulation (DBS) strategies guided by results from non-invasive imaging studies.
Unfortunately, these have failed to show significant efficacy, likely because of the vast heterogeneity in disease
presentation and the lack of sufficient data to understand the neurobiological causes of the disease. Current approaches
use unspecific biological (pharmacology) or anatomical (DBS) targets, leading to partial effectiveness and side effects.
Patient-specific depictions of the basis of depression would allow tailored treatment designs, but data of sufficient quality
is mostly unavailable with standard approaches to the study of neural function. Recent approaches leverage multi-areal
invasive electrophysiological recordings in neurosurgical epilepsy patients, which often suffer from co-morbid depression,
to collect of high-quality (multi-areal, high signal-to-noise, high temporal resolution) neurophysiological data, and have
the potential to allow patient-specific models of disease and targeted neurostimulation. In addition, machine learning
methods allow mapping this high-dimensional neural data onto patient’s emotional states centrally affected in depression,
and highlight the involvement of single-site and cross-areal activity in limbic regions, including the hippocampus, amygdala
and orbitofrontal cortex. However, decoding methods present several challenges of their own. First, they select features
associated with self-reported mood - a complex, abstract concept that lacks an objective, quantitative foundation and
may be reported differently across patients, making generalization challenging. Second, data-driven methods are not
grounded on current models of brain function, and thus lack mechanistic explanations of disease underpinnings. Third,
mood is reported in the absence of overt behavior, making it difficult to frame the deficits in the behavioral functions
subserved by affected brain areas. Finally, current approaches lack a connection between decoded neural features and
stimulation strategies. Here, we propose to address these challenges by combining distributed iEEG recordings,
reinforcement learning models of decision-making and machine-learning approaches to study reward processing in
relevant brain areas from epilepsy patients with and without comorbid depression. We will examine local activations as
well as circuit dynamics (functional connectivity) in orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus during decision-
making behavior. We will seek to ground neurophysiological data in reinforcement learning models of decision-making to
provide quantitative, reproducible behavioral metrics that impact mood, and to build on long-standing observations
regarding damaged reward processing in depression. Finally, we will develop patient-tailored stimulation paradigms for
depression constrained by our observations on patient-specific disease presentation. We expect that the combination of
invasive recordings with reward modeling will open the door to a theoretically-grounded computational characterization
of neurobehavioral deficits in depression, and allow development of novel treatment strategies."

10890134,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Increasing numbers of opioid overdoses have been observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, likely reflecting
the pandemic’s multiple effects on this already vulnerable population. People in recovery from opioid use disorder
(OUD) have reported disproportionate psychosocial distress and isolation, as well as significant disruptions in
access to treatment including peer support, during the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative outcomes are
especially acute for rural, low-income, and minority populations in recovery from OUD. Peer support is a key
component of many evidence-based OUD recovery programs: it improves recovery capital, improves treatment
engagement, improves perceived social support, and reduces psychosocial distress, particularly when used in
conjunction with other evidence-based treatments such as medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). This
grant, submitted in response to PA 20-237, therefore proposes a randomized controlled trial of a novel mobile
peer support app platform among a national sample of 1300 patients in recovery from opioid use disorders
(OUDs), as an adjunct to usual care, during COVID-19. Our previously piloted online-only recruitment and follow-
up strategy – in which we meld patient-reported outcomes with administrative datasets – allows strategic
recruitment of often-excluded participants from across the United States, including those facing the highest
barriers to treatment. The mobile app-based peer support intervention, provided as an individual-level
enhancement of existing treatment and recovery programs, will allow individuals in OUD recovery to access a
tailored, anonymous, peer-moderated support group 24/7. The app is augmented with natural language
processing tools capable of automatically ‘flagging’ critical or clinically relevant content, thereby creating a
scalable system to keep groups safe and constructive. Participants will be followed for 6 months through both
self-report and administrative outcomes. The study’s primary outcome is self-reported recovery capital,
complemented by objectively measured administrative data on retention in treatment programs from our
community and governmental partners in a sub-sample of 650 patients from RI and IN. Hypothesized secondary
outcomes are mitigation of psychosocial effects of COVID-19 on this vulnerable population, including depressive
symptoms, stress, and loneliness, as well as objective adverse events of emergency department visits and opioid
overdoses. Finally, we will explore whether state- and county-level variables moderate efficacy. SIGNIFICANCE:
OUD is a major public health problem, and patients in recovery from OUD are experiencing worse outcomes
during the COVID-19 pandemic. If this mobile app demonstrates efficacy among a large national sample of
patients, it has the potential to augment existing treatment programs, improve recovery capital, and reduce
disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on this vulnerable population."
10843885,"Large prospective cohort studies with banked DNA have increasingly utilized next generation sequencing
(NGS) to evaluate the effects of genes, the environment and lifestyle on health outcomes, but NGS can also
identify actionable genetic variants that may significantly impact the future health of the research participant
and/or their relatives. How best to educate participants about their options to decline or receive research
results, how to honor preferences for receipt of results, and how to best communicate results, particularly in
large cohorts remains unknown. In the RESPECT studies (R01 CA190871:Bradbury), we have developed and
established the feasibility and favorable patient-reported outcomes with using an eHealth education and
consent intervention as an alternative to traditional pre-disclosure genetic counseling. The goal of the
proposed competitive renewal is to conduct a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation study to evaluate
eHealth delivery alternatives for pre-disclosure education and return of actionable genetic research results.
Building upon the RESPECT studies (R01 CA190871: Bradbury), we will adapt our RESPECT eHealth pre-
disclosure intervention to offer 1250 Penn Biobank participants (625 with actionable results and 625 controls) a
chatbot enabled eHealth education intervention (eHealthED) that provides information about the benefits and
limitations of receiving research results, how results will be returned and their options for declining receipt of
results (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will randomize participants with actionable research results to receive their results
via telephone with a GC (usual care) or a stakeholder-informed and user-tested chat-bot enabled eHealth
return of results intervention (eHealthROR). All participants randomized to eHealthROR (e.g. intervention arm)
will be provided the option to speak with a GC as an alternative, before or after receiving results. Concurrently,
we will conduct a CFIR (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research)-informed process evaluation
to understand moderators of eHealth intervention usage, patient outcomes, costs and facilitators and barriers
to future implementation and sustainability of using eHealth interventions for return of actionable genetic
research results in large and sociodemographically diverse research cohorts (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the
majority of participants will access supplemental eHealth and chatbot enabled education and that disclosure of
actionable research results by our eHealth intervention will result in non-inferior short-term and longitudinal
patient cognitive, affective and behavioral outcomes and lower costs, providing a scalable model for returning
actionable results to research participants in large biobanks. Thus, we expect this study to inform evidence-
based practice guidelines for return of actionable genetic research results to participants."
10911224,"Abstract
 Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is the most common subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma
(PTCL) with distinct pathological and clinical characteristics. It is a difficult-to-diagnose and lacks effective
therapies due to poor understanding of the molecular pathogenesis. Using genome-wide gene expression
profiling (GEP), we have defined a robust molecular classifier for accurate diagnosis, identified oncogenic
pathways, discovered its cell-of-origin, and deciphered the role of the tumor milieu in disease prognosis. Using
high-throughput genomic analysis, we also identified frequent mutations in epigenetic regulators (TET2, IDH2
and DNMT3A) and regulators of T-cell activation (RHOA and CD28) in AITL. Co-occurrence of TET2 mutations
with IDH2 mutation (hotspot: arginine-172; IDH2R172) is unique in AITL compared to other hematological
malignancies where they are mutually exclusive, suggesting their cooperative role in T-cell lymphomagenesis.
We have generated unique murine models with conditional loss of Tet2 (Tet2-/-) and double mutant (Tet2-/-
/IDH2R172K) in CD4+ T-cells, and murine lymphomas with follicular helper T-cell (TFH) phenotype were observed.
In addition, we generated several patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of AITL with IDH2R172 and/or TET2 mutations.
We hypothesize that TET2 deficiency in T cells alters the DNA methylation profile leading to an altered
genetic program favoring TFH cell differentiation and clonal expansion, facilitating transformation with
subsequent hits, including IDH2R172 mutation, which will further alter the epigenome and oncogenic
pathways in TFH -cell transformation. We will define the precise role of these genetic lesions in T-cell
differentiation and in AITL pathogenesis. We also edited normal human CD4+ T-cells using CRISPR/CAS9 to
generate TET2-/- T-cells for functional analysis and cross-validation of murine models. SinceTET2 mutations are in
hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) in some AITLs, interactions between TET2 deficient T- and stromal
cells during lymphomagenesis will be explored. We will test the efficacy of therapeutic interventions, including
demethylating agents for TET2 deficiency and IDH2 inhibitors and/or glutamine depletion for TET2/IDH2 double
mutant tumors in murine models and PDX of AITL. To accomplish the objective, three aims are planned:
Specific Aim 1: To determine the mechanisms by which Tet2 deficiency mediates T-cell transformation and the
role of Tet2 mutation in stromal cells in lymphomagenesis.
Specific Aim 2: To delineate the mechanisms of combined Tet2 and IDH2R172K mutations in AITL pathogenesis.
Specific Aim 3: To evaluate therapies targeting oncogenic mechanisms mediated by Tet2 and IDH2R172
mutations.
 Our long-term research goal is to define the pathobiology of AITL, through integrated functional epigenomic
approaches using in vitro modified human T-cells, patient samples and relevant murine models, thus identifying
promising novel targets for treatment that may be tested pre-clinically in PDX models."
10888177,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cellular senescence, one of the major hallmarks of aging, describes the sudden inability for cells to divide.
Senescent cells often accumulate with age, in response to physical and chemical stressors (genomic instability,
telomere attrition, irradiation, etc.), though the overlap between these stressors and neurological diseases such
as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is currently unknown. In-vitro experiments of senescence often utilize contrived
stressors such as hydrogen peroxide or radiation, that may not be physiologically relevant for age-related
diseases such as AD. Furthermore, the senescence phenotypes observed in vitro are likely not complete models
for what is occurring in dynamic biological systems.
 Soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (Aβo), an important hallmark in AD, have been shown to potently induce
senescence in a variety of brain cell types and environments, in contrast to fibrillar Ab. Aβo is thought to bind
membrane proteins and subsequently signal downstream aggregation of related amyloids such as tau. In fact,
the presence of endogenous Aβo is one of the strongest indicators of disease severity in AD models and
organisms, suggesting a link between AD and cellular senescence that is only beginning to be explored.
 In order to study this association, we propose to combine gold-standard techniques and single-cell omics
data in order to define heterogenous genetic and epigenetic signatures of senescence that are distinctly a
function of their induction type. Doing so will also produce robust signatures and biomarkers of senescence in
brain cells that can be utilized for the pathological phenotyping of human tissues. These measures will also allow
for the comparison of disparate senescent behaviors to help identify lab-derived amyloids that best resemble
patient-derived constructs. We will evaluate multiple lab-derived Aβo constructs, including those stabilized from
lipids located in predominantly diseased regions of the brain. Observations would be synergistically coupled with
solution biophysics experiments and molecular modeling, providing analogous structural data for each inducer
type. Taken together, these measurements will uniquely profile senescence in brain cells, define the degree of
overlap between endogenous senescence inducers and those reconstituted in the lab, and highlighting how AD
risk is modulated by cellular senescence."

In 2019, US state and county child protection investigators determined that 656,000 children were exposed to
maltreatment by their caregivers. This number likely underestimates the true number of maltreated children by
a considerable margin. Maltreatment exposure can disrupt psychobiological systems essential for a child’s
health and adaptive functioning and result in debilitating outcomes such as post-traumatic stress, depression,
self-destructive and violent behavior, risk-taking, and substance abuse. Yet only a small proportion of those
children at risk have benefited from decades of research to acquire the scientific knowledge to prevent
maltreatment exposures and their significant consequences. This proposal seeks to enable larger-scale
preventative results through an integrated scientific program designed to address the central barrier limiting the
scale of results: available preventative interventions are insufficiently guided by robust scientific
knowledge on the complex etiologies of maltreatment exposures and their consequential outcomes.
The Center on Causal Data Science for Child and Adolescent Maltreatment Prevention (CHAMP Center) is
proposed to enable the achievement of larger-scale results by: 1) applying state-of-the-art causal data science
methods to several large, relevant, existing data sets to determine the complex etiologies for several
categories of maltreatment exposures (e.g., sexual abuse, physical abuse, neglect) and maltreatment-related
outcomes (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, self-destructive behavior, substance abuse,
functional impairments); 2) translating this knowledge into specific decision support tools for practitioners in
the child services system to personalize interventions that precisely target etiological factors; and 3) conducting
a proof-of-concept field trial on this form of decision support. Through the integrated work of its two projects
and three cores, the CHAMP Center will establish processes to discover and translate scientific knowledge on
complex etiologies of maltreatment and its consequences and disseminate knowledge and tools for large-scale
prevention of maltreatment exposures and their devastating consequences in children at risk."

of the SMaHT Network. We will provide administrative and budget support for developing and managing
engagement and training, including coordinating opportunities for researchers within and outside the Network.
The WashU SMaHT-OC will integrate the efforts of all the funded initiatives of the diverse SMaHT Network, and,
through innovative methodology, establish a research environment that promotes collaboration, coordination,

10884402,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fundamental cellular functions such as transcription, RNA processing, and DNA damage repair are achieved
through the correct spatial and temporal localization of biomolecular complexes containing dozens of different
protein and nucleic acid species. RNA-binding proteins that contain low-complexity amino acid sequences are
essential components of these complexes but also form pathological assemblies in neurodegenerative diseases
and pediatric cancers. The function of these low complexity sequences in healthy and disease states remain
poorly understood, partly because of the difficulty in obtaining high resolution structural information of the pro-
teins participating in these assemblies. The RNA binding protein Ewing sarcoma breakpoint 1 (EWSR1) is mem-
ber of a group of approximately 70 human RNA-binding proteins that contain intrinsically disordered low-com-
plexity regions that are deficient in charged amino acids but contain a high proportion of aromatic residues.
These low complexity regions self-associate, driving the assembly of dynamic clusters in a process commonly
referred to as liquid-liquid phase separation. EWSR1 primarily functions in mRNA processing and maturation
through the formation of dynamic, reversible complexes that provide a scaffold for, and promote the correct
spatial location of the processing machinery. Mutations in the low-complexity region cause uncontrolled assem-
bly of EWSR1 (and related proteins) forming pathological inclusions linked to the progression of amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, frontal temporal dementia and related neuropathies. Further, through chromosomal transloca-
tions, the low-complexity domain of EWSR1 is joined to DNA-binding domains forming potent oncogenic fusions
responsible for the development of pediatric sarcomas. There is a paucity of molecular structural information on
the pathogenic function of EWSR1 and particularly how the low-complexity domain contributes to the oncogenic
properties of EWSR1-fusions. Recent technological advances in NMR spectroscopy now enable detection and
quantification of the dynamic, highly transient interactions that drive complex formation, thus providing the req-
uisite tool for determining the structure and function of EWSR1. This project will employ advanced NMR spec-
troscopic and other biophysical techniques, fluorescent and hydrodynamic methods, spectroscopic aggregation
assays and microscopy in conjunction with biochemical and biological assays to: (1) determine the molecular
events leading to EWSR1 self-assembly and biomolecular condensation; (2) define the structural details of how
the low complexity domain contributes to normal and abnormal EWSR1 functions; and (3) determine the role of
phase separation in the formation and stabilization of protein:DNA complexes involving the oncogenic EWS-FLI1
fusion protein. The results of our investigations will help advance our general understanding about macromolec-
ular assembly of dynamic protein/nucleoprotein complexes formed by low-complexity proteins. Understanding
the structural basis that defines their activity will guide the development of strategies to therapeutically target
low-complexity proteins or their molecular partners."

suicide mortality and effectiveness of preventive interventions across vulnerable groups. Further, although we

10897016,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) continues to pose a major burden to the healthcare system,
women are twice as likely as men to develop HFpEF, and no targeted therapies for HFpEF exist. Coronary
microvascular dysfunction (CMD), defined as impaired function of the small microvessels within the heart, is a
widely prevalent yet poorly understood condition that also predominantly affects women. HFpEF is the most
frequently experienced morbid outcome in women with CMD, who are often younger than those with other
HFpEF phenotypes. While we and others have shown that HFpEF is present in up to a third of women with CMD,
the pathobiology of CMD-related HFpEF remains unclear. CMD leads to chronic myocardial ischemia, which
results in an intra-cardiomyocyte metabolic shift towards increased glucose utilization, reduced free fatty acid
oxidation, and triglyceride (TG) accumulation in the myocardium – leading to myocardial steatosis, which we
have associated with diastolic dysfunction, a pre-HFpEF trait. Because women with CMD are more likely than
men to suffer chronic ischemia for longer durations, our central hypothesis is that CMD-related chronic ischemia
and subsequent myocardial steatosis are key contributors to the development of HFpEF in women with CMD.
Emerging data from our group underscores the importance of chronic inflammatory (i.e. eicosanoid) pathways
in governing responses to the ischemic, intra-cardiomyocyte metabolic shifts, and cardiac mechanical stressors
that have been implicated in CMD and HFpEF pathophysiology. Therefore, the aims of this Early Stage
Investigator R01 application are to: (1) determine the relationship between chronic ischemia and myocardial
steatosis and the extent to which myocardial steatosis mediates associations between ischemia and pre-clinical
HFpEF in CMD; and, (2) identify specific eicosanoid molecules that underlie risk for CMD-related myocardial
steatosis, pre-clinical HFpEF traits, and clinical HFpEF. In a prospective cohort of 220 CMD women undergoing
comprehensive cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and spectroscopy, we will determine clinical HFpEF
status and quantify: (i) myocardial TG content and steatosis; (ii) chronic ischemia burden, and (iii) pre-clinical
CMR HFpEF traits to relate chronic ischemia with myocardial steatosis. Plasma biosamples from the cohort will
undergo high-throughput analyses to identify distinct eicosanoid profiles associated with myocardial steatosis.
An exploratory analysis with 18F-FDG PET will relate the eicosanoid profiles to myocardial-specific inflammation.
The eicosanoid profiles will also be tested for incident HFpEF in a large community cohort with over a decade of
HFpEF outcomes. Understanding the role of cardiac steatosis with respect to CMD-related ischemia,
inflammation, and HFpEF traits promises to reveal novel targets for preventing and treating HFpEF, especially
in women."
10890766,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - Neuropathology Core
The overarching goal of the UCD ADRC is to understand the multiple and complex determinants that explain
the heterogeneity of cognitive trajectories among diverse older adults. To help achieve this goal, the primary
mission of the Neuropathology Core (NPC) is to assess and quantify brain injury in the form of multiple
pathologies essential to the most precise and relevant characterization of individual cognitive ability. To provide
even deeper pathological phenotypes, the NPC has leveraged and enhanced Core infrastructure by
implementing digital pathology and developing machine learning workflows for quantitative regional analysis.
These NPC data, when linked with comprehensive cognitive assessment, brain imaging, and other biological
markers generated by other ADRC Cores will facilitate new understandings into the protective/risk factors of
brain aging and dementia processes. Our NPC is unique in (1) its study subjects have been drawn from a
diverse multi-ethnic/racial longitudinal cohort maintained by the Clinical Core (CC) with an emphasis on
early disease/early pathology, (2) its collection of tissue samples from cases whose cognitive trajectories have
been modified by clinically, imaging proven, and pathologically confirmed cerebrovascular injury and (3) its
sizeable number of samples and datasets from minority participants (39 Hispanic/Latino, 18 Asian, and 52
African American) that have resulted in high impact publications. In collaboration with the other ADRC
Cores, we have built, maintained, and enhanced our research infrastructure, accumulating unique datasets,
high quality samples, and experience in clinic-pathological, translational, and basic research collaborations.
New causes and contributing factors of dementia continue to be discovered by studies using post-mortem
brain specimens, enriching the pool of biomarkers for risk of dementia. Modern neuropathology techniques
(e.g., our machine learning studies) combined with new molecular tools (such as our Quanterix system within
the Biomarker core) have the potential to tremendously advance our understanding of disease pathogenesis,
thus providing a degree of precision to anchor the clinical and biological heterogeneity commonly observed in
dementia. Moreover, neuropathology plays a central role in future interventions, as postmortem diagnosis is
the gold standard to establish biomarkers applicability and the efficacy of experimental interventions. Thus, we
envision the NPC will continue to be a central player in multi-component research projects in the effort to find
new avenues for dementia treatment. As such, the NPC leadership will continue networking with researchers
to conduct multidisciplinary research while upgrading the core diagnostic capabilities to enable detection of
diverse brain injury pathways using novel methods."
10928252,"Abstract
The application of data science methodologies to large-scale diverse and complex biomedical
datasets for novel discoveries requires access to data, tools, workflows and computing
infrastructure, along with training and support. With many of these lacking in Africa, including
the skills for execution, there is a need to develop new infrastructure that takes into account
the African context and addresses barriers present in low and middle income countries. We
will develop an Open Data Science Gateway for the DS-I Africa consortium that includes the
eLwazi platform and associated training, supporting tools and resources. eLwazi, symbolizing
“knowledge”, will be a modular, scalable platform based on the Data Biosphere concept, that
enables the application of data science tools to drive novel discoveries for health. From eLwazi
workspaces, novice and advanced users will be able to: 1) search for data in a data repository
and catalogue; 2) retrieve relevant datasets stored locally or at federated sites; 3) search and
retrieve relevant tools and workflows; 4) execute their analyses on a choice of computing
environment; and 5) visualize and share their results. Users will be an integral part of the
development process, providing input on their needs and feedback, and will be supported
through a helpdesk, user groups and a comprehensive data science training program. We will
develop a transparent cost model and build African skills and infrastructure to ensure long
term sustainability of the platform. The Open Data Science Gateway will facilitate open,
collaborative research that strives to develop novel health applications in Africa and beyond.
This African led initiative aligns with the vision and requirements of the emerging African Open
Science Platform. An active outreach program will extend the reach of eLwazi to other cohorts,
datasets and consortia and promote partnerships in academia and industry. Leveraging
H3ABioNet’s expertise and capacity developed since 2012 together with international
expertise from the leaders in the field, and using existing frameworks and standards will
ensure a successful platform is implemented timeously and is interoperable with Common
Fund programs and other international initiatives to ensure global applicability."
10890767,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Outreach Recruitment and Engagement Core (OREC)
Increased prevalence of dementia in African American and Hispanic communities compounds the
disproportionate economic and social burden that ADRD has in these historically under-represented groups,
thereby creating a public health crisis should these trends continue unabated. To innovate cures and
treatments, we need to understand the broadest characterization of AD phenotypes to enable discovery for
new biomarkers that index disease nosology and stage. UC Davis is a national leader for minority recruitment
and retention due to its commitment to the principles of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR).
Over its nearly 30-year history, the UC Davis ADRC has developed robust outreach and recruitment processes
that reliably identifies, efficiently screens, and clearly consents older adult participants from a wide range of
SES, educational and cultural backgrounds. We propose to enhance our continuing in-person efforts with a
complimentary digital e-toolbox. These e-tools use novel digital media marketing that allows us to match
unique participant demographics/interests (e.g., African American older adult without cognitive impairment
living alone in an urban setting) with specific content (e.g., a video vignette about coping with loneliness and
signs for when to see a doctor), thus enhancing participant engagement and creating a personally
meaningful recruitment experience. We refer to the combined toolbox of both in-person and e-resources as
the Memorable Outreach, Recruitment, Retention and Engagement (MORRE) toolbox. Using the enhanced
MORRE toolbox we aim to: (1) Outreach to diverse older adult communities of Black, Hispanic and White
older adults across Northern California; (2). Pique interest and call-to-action communities of color to participate
in a clinical research program focusing on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias; (3) Retain our
participants in this clinical cohort by tailor making (a) appreciation events (in-person and digital) to focus on
how their personal contributions of time and effort make the difference in care and treatment discovery; (b)
easy-to-use health education media environment personalized to each participant’s age, education and
level/stage of disability in-person using familiar digital platforms (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, e-newsletters,
recommended content based on likes and viewing histories); and (4) Engage community leaders through our
community advisory board (CAB) in an ongoing dialogue about research project design, community principles
and priorities, potential facilitators and barriers that may impact recruitment, and strategize community-based
research project implementation. The significance of this OREC is its foundational support and advocacy for a
center-wide vision of CBPR though extensive collaboration with NIA, other ADRC cores and local community
partners. The scientific impact of the OREC will be its creation of sophisticated technical resources that
enhance recruitment, assessment and retention of Blacks and Hispanics into clinical research studies."
10928254,"The Data Science for Health Discovery and Innovation in Africa Coordinating Centre

with the necessary information and tools required to lead the Consortium, guided by
the overarching goals and navigating by evidenced based decision making. Working
in a pan-continental interdisciplinary network will be challenging, however its diversity
will offer many opportunities for data scientists and communities to learn from each
other and develop innovative health solutions. The coordinating centre principal
investigator (PI) will communicate directly with DS-I Africa PI’s and their affiliates and

the University of Cape Town will leverage institutional and network resources,
experience in coordinating large networks across several continents, human
resources, digital and network tools, existing stakeholder networks, knowledge of
policies, guidelines, research agreements and its experience in working in over eleven
African countries, often under challenging conditions. The CC will use strategic
outreach, community engagement and communication plans to raise awareness,

10890771,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Biomarker Core
The overarching goal of the UCD ADRC is to understand the multiple and complex determinants that explain
heterogeneity of cognitive trajectories and progression to dementia among a cohort of diverse older adults. In
line with this goal, our study subjects form a diverse multi-ethnic/racial longitudinal cohort. To be able to offer
disease-modifying interventions in the subject’s lifetime, a precise and dynamic biological definition of the
subject’s disease trajectory is essential. It requires a comprehensive biomarker assessment of both AD
pathology and non-AD specific brain injury that may contribute to and modify the trajectories of cognitive
decline. This task is particularly critical when faced with mixed pathological processes manifested by subjects
of diverse backgrounds. To meet this challenge, the UC Davis ADRC launched a biorepository in 2014 to
collect blood specimens and establish standard operation procedures. We have since grown substantially in
expertise and sample collection via continuous funding through several NIA- and Alzheimer’s Association-
funded blood biomarker, clinical trial, and epidemiological projects, as well as participation in national programs
such as MarkVCID, ADNI, NCRAD, and AD Metabolomic Consortium. Currently we have deposited thousands
of blood specimens (serum, plasma, DNA, and RNA) from 1279 subjects in our ADRC Longitudinal Cohort;
hundreds of them have given longitudinal samples. We have also collected saliva and blood samples from
hundreds of subjects participating in ADRC-affiliated clinical trials and epidemiological projects such as the Life
After 90 Study. Sample categorization, inventory, tracking, and retrieval are conducted by the barcode-based
OpenSpecimen network software, which is further integrated into the ADRC Web-based interface. Moreover,
we have established expertise in ultra-sensitive protein biomarker analysis using SiMoA technology, and built a
broad multi-omics platform for collaboration by providing expertise and resources for emerging omics
technology including glycomics, glycoproteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics. In this ADRC application, we
will formally establish the Biomarker Core (BC), which will accomplish the following four specific aims: Aim 1 –
to expand the repository of high-quality samples from diverse populations; Aim 2 – to quantify and integrate
essential and emerging blood biomarkers to support diagnostics and theragnostics efforts of ADRC; Aim 3 – to
provide infrastructure to support novel biomarker discovery, clinical trials, and UCD ADRC-affiliated clinical and
epidemiological projects; and Aim 4 – to extend our existing robust and cost-efficient systems for sharing data
and specimens broadly with the research community to support innovative research and career development.
We believe the deposited data and specimens from our diverse multi-ethnic/racial longitudinal cohort will
constitute a unique, readily sharable resource to enable cognitive stage-dependent analyses of inter-related
biomarkers in data- and hypothesis-driven studies. Our expertise in SiMoA, glycomics, lipidomics, and
metabolomics will help investigators nationwide to advance into new frontiers of biomarker discovery."
10890774,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Neuroimaging Core
The Neuroimaging Core (NC) plays an integral role in the UC Davis (UCD) ADRC scientific mission by
providing imaging-based structural and functional markers of aging and disease processes. These imaging
biomarkers support the primary aim of the UCD ADRC to understand factors that influence cognitive
trajectories from normal aging to dementia. Building on nearly 15 years of success, the NC will continue to
provide services related to acquisition, storage, post-processing and dissemination of imaging data. In addition,
the NC will collaborate with other departments at UC Davis as well as other institutions to develop novel state-
of-the-art methods for measuring the lifespan course of brain injury leading to dementia.
The Aims of the NC reflect the steady progression of its capabilities. The NC is now a mature component of the
ADRC that enriches the other Cores and the AD research community. It currently provides raw images to the
Clinical and Neuropathology Cores to support diagnostic activities. The NC also provides validated state-of-
the-art measurements of brain structure and function to the Data Management and Statistics Core and other
collaborating centers to support research projects. Finally, the NC works with the Research Education
Component and the Outreach Recruitment and Education Core to train investigators in neuroimaging methods
and disseminate information regarding imaging related research.
The addition of Dr. Audrey Fan to the NC brings a new dimension of expertise in the use of MRI and PET
imaging for new biomarkers of vascular disease, aging and cognitive change. In addition to imaging acquisition
expertise, she provides a strong link to the Biomedical Engineering Department at UC Davis and to new
facilities such as the total-body EXPLORER PET scanner. The novel imaging strategies and kinetic modeling
approaches from Dr. Fan’s lab complement existing NC research capabilities.
With over 20 grants, including SCAN, currently supporting image acquisitions and processing by the NC, we
provide benefits national and international collaborations that are far beyond the level of Core funding. The
overall goals of the NC to image brain injury leading to dementia aligns with the National Alzheimer’s Project
Act (NAPA) mission to identify pre-symptomatic AD, establishing early imaging biomarkers through large
public-private studies such as ADNI. The goals of NC are to continue to provide essential resources to the
UCD ADRC and build new capabilities at the forefront of neuroimaging."
10890776,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - Research Education Core (REC)
As the population of older adults in the US continues to rapidly grow and become more racially/ethnically
diverse, there is an urgent need to better understand how to improve timely diagnosis and culturally responsive
care of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias and their family caregivers. Despite the
growing diversity of the population and differences in dementia incidence and prevalence, gaps in scientific
knowledge related to the cause and elimination of these disparities remain. In addition, the number of scientists
from historically underrepresented groups who may have special insight into the cause and cure of these
disparities remains limited. Therefore, the goal of the UC Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC)
Education Component (REC) is to develop new and innovative opportunities for research education and
training of the next generation of scientists who will harness the currently available and expanding resources of
the ADRC to address the goals of NAPA to effectively treat Alzheimer’s disease and associated disorders by
2025 . The REC supports the mission of the ADRC by capitalizing on and expanding the research education
opportunities of junior investigators, with an emphasis on recruiting individuals from historically
underrepresented groups. There is a strong need for new, creative, and diverse junior investigators to address
the diversity and complexity of cognitive impairment in diverse populations. Towards this end, the goals of the
REC are to (1) Outreach, recruit and engage junior investigators from diverse personal and
professional backgrounds who will conduct Alzheimer’s disease-related research; (2) Develop and
support a tailored mentoring and training plan for diverse junior investigators in the area of AD, with a
particular focus on strengthening and diversifying the research workforce; and (3) Monitor and
evaluate research, training and career development progress of trainees.
The UC Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center has an extensive mentoring and research education
record that includes graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty with interests in Alzheimer’s
disease-related research. We will continue to build on this infrastructure with REC leaders –Dr. Oanh Meyer
and Dr. Charles DeCarli, as well as the Training Oversight Committee. REC will leverage existing resources
and expertise from local and national programs to contribute to the research education of future leaders in
Alzheimer’s disease-related research. REC also will capitalize on the rich diversity of UC Davis and connect
with programs such as the Center for the Advancement of Multicultural Perspectives on Science to ensure
recruitment of underrepresented groups. The interdisciplinary expertise of REC program faculty and affiliates
will ensure the recruitment of diverse and promising trainees who will enter the ADRD scientific workforce."

(HFC) and Wayne County Community College District (WCCCD), to develop the Michigan IRACDA:
Diversifying the Academic Workforce in STEM program to develop future scientist educators. HFC and
WCCCD each have 18,000-20,000 students with a large number of underrepresented minority students. Both
colleges provide numerous courses for participation by our scholars and teaching mentors with outstanding
teaching records and strong commitments to sharing their expertise. The proposed four-year program for each
trainee scholar involves an initial 3 years of 75% time research training by UM research mentors with excellent
records of mentorship and funding. The participating research mentors span the University community and
include a combined record of training >400 current and past trainees and nearly $15M in current funding. The
remaining 25% training time during the first 3 years consists of training in teaching and professional
development. Training in teaching involves extensive classroom experiences at HFC and WCCCD,
participation in outstanding programs provided by the renowned UM Center for Learning and Teaching (CRLT),
and culminating in a “capstone” experience chosen by each scholar. Capstone experiences include serving as
instructor of record for an entire course, generation of new curricular materials, or participation in education
research. The 4th year of training will be covered by the research mentors providing full time in the laboratory to
allow the scholars to complete research projects, publish papers, carry out some teaching and work towards
securing a faculty position. For this renewal application, our program objectives are to (1) promote
independent, innovative, and rigorous scholarship, team-science, and research discovery; (2) engage our
Fellows in unique teaching experiences each year with expert teaching mentors and formal pedagogical
training; (3) provide extensive, individualized mentoring using IDPs, mentoring plans, trained faculty mentors,
and both peer-to-peer and alumni networking; (4) deliver a range of professional development opportunities,
including training in RCR, Rigor & Reproducibility, and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion; and (5) provide
pedagogical and professional development opportunities for teaching mentors and inform community college
students about STEM education and research. Unique features of our Program include the outstanding record
of the research and teaching mentors, a focus on students with diverse backgrounds where we anticipate a
huge impact on the trajectory of the students, full engagement of the renowned UM CRLT, a robust scholar
and Program evaluation process, and strong institutional support. We are confident our program will continue
our demonstrated success in preparing a new generation of scientist-educators to be highly effective and
successful faculty members and mentors, and that we will inspire an up-and-coming cohort of students to
pursue science and engineering careers."

10914220,"Core B - Project Summary
To have successful therapies for Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency it is necessary to have animal
models that recapitulate the phenotypes see in human patients to test therapeutics, including
gene therapy and genome editing approaches, and develop clinically relevant therapeutic
benchmarks to ascertain the success of those therapies. To that aim this Core is working with
Project 1 (Flotte) to create an AAT-Null or PiZ ferret that conditionally expresses human AAT
(hAAT) as well as a murine model of the PiZ mutation on the background of the AAT knock-out
mouse created in our group.
The knock-out mouse recapitulates a lung phenotype with its complete lack of AAT production,
but does not completely model the state of the PiZ AAT patient who have some residual blood
levels of AAT that produce residual anti-elastase activity. In this Core we aim to create and
characterize an AAT-KO-PiZ mouse on the AAT-KO background and well as characterize an
existing AAT-KO/PiZ cross mouse. In addition to being a more relevant model to test gene
therapies, the AAT-KO-PiZ mouse will also serve as the model to further investigate genome
editing of the Z-AAT alleles in Project 2 (Xue). The current PiZ mouse contains multiple copies
of the PiZ gene, making it a non-ideal model for genome editing. Both mouse models will allow
us to elucidate further the role that the PiZ mutation plays without the presence of wild-type murine
AAT, something that has not been modeled in the mouse before. In Core B we will also produce
humanized liver NSG-PiZ mice to select for AAV serotypes that target human hepatocytes for
Project 3 (Wang).
In addition to the production of mouse and ferret models for use in Projects 1, 2, and 3 we will
also work with Projects 1 and 2 to characterize the pulmonary phenotype responses to gene
therapy and genome editing. The core will offer novel expertise in rodent pulmonary function
testing, bronchoalveolar lavage testing and facilitation of lung computed tomography in
collaboration with Dr. Bankier and Tufts Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine."
10914222,"Project Summary (Project 1)
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a common single gene disorder caused by mutations in
the SERPINA1 gene, which normally encodes a very abundant serum antiprotease, whose
primary function is to protect the interstitial elastin matrix of the lung from degradation by
neutrophil elastase (NE). The E242K (PI*Z) mutant allele is very common among those of
European ancestry, and E342K homozygotes encode a protein with impaired secretion,
resulting in deficient serum levels, leading to unrestrained NE activity, degrading pulmonary
elastin. This process triggers lung inflammation and leads to loss of lung elastic recoil and
airways obstruction, creating the clinical picture of emphysema, which is the life-limiting effect of
AATD in most patients. Current AATD therapy consists of weekly IV infusion of AAT, but this
therapy has never been proven to benefit lung function in patients in prospective studies,
leading to questions about whether the previously identified serum target level (11 µM) is
sufficient, or whether gene therapy to restore such a level would be efficacious. Our laboratory
has previously developed rAAV gene therapy vectors and used them in clinical trials. Those
trials have failed to achieve the target, achieving levels just over 0.5 µM but being sustained
over 5 years in patients. We have also use CRISPR-based technology to produce the first
SERPINA1-knockout mice and have begun a collaboration with the University of Iowa group,
who have created both SERPINA1-knockout and SERPINA1-E342K ferret models. In the
current proposal, improved and optimized vectors will be tested in both mice and ferret models.
In the ferrets, they will be tested alongside sophisticated conditional transgenic reconstitution to
determine whether the optimal target for therapy is 11 µM vs. 25 µM. These studies will pave
the way for better rAAV-AAT vectors appropriate for future clinical product development.
In this project, we propose to study genetic emphysema due to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
(AATD). AATD is both fairly common as a genetic disease and is a model of much more
common causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In the proposal, we will use
advanced gene editing tools to create genetically defined animal models of AATD (known as
transgenic animals), both in mice and in ferrets, which are a good model to study lung diseases.
In the course of the study, we will use both additional transgenic approaches and modified
recombinant viruses (rAAV) to genetically treat AATD in these models and examine how we
might design evaluate the effectiveness of future gene therapies for genetic emphysema."
10914223,"PROJECT 2 - Project Summary/Abstract
Gene editing has the potential to correct mutations and provide long-term therapeutic benefit for patients with
rare monogenic diseases like alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). AATD is caused by mutations in the AAT
(or PI) gene, which encodes a serine protease inhibitor that is made in hepatocytes and delivered to lung to
neutralize neutrophil elastase. The PI*Z mutation encodes mutant Z-AAT protein that aggregates in
hepatocytes, which can cause liver disease and reduces serum AAT. Reduced serum AAT causes progressive
airway disease and emphysema. Gene correction would address both aspects of AATD.
CRISPR-mediated homology directed repair (HDR) can be used to partially correct mutations in mouse liver.
Yet, HDR is limited by the need to deliver a long DNA repair template, its inefficiency in non-dividing or slow-
dividing cell types, and its generation of genotoxic double-strand breaks. To address these limitations, this
proposal will develop two CRISPR-based gene correction strategies that do not require a double-strand break:
prime editing and adenine base editing. Prime editor (PE) is comprised of Cas9 nickase fused to reverse
transcriptase and an extended guide RNA that doubles as a template for reverse transcriptase to copy editing
information into the genomic target. Adenine base editor (ABE), comprised of a Cas9 nickase fused to an
adenosine deaminase, can correct G-to-A point mutations in mouse liver. The PI*Z allele results from a G-to-A
mutation; and thus, is a good candidate for gene correction via ABE and PE.
The goal of this project is to optimize PE and ABE tools for AAT gene correction in vivo by developing ABE
and PE vectors that can be accommodated by adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids; maximizing on-target
editing and minimizing off-target editing; and determining how immune responses affect editing. Aim 1 will
develop novel PE tools for in vivo AAT gene correction. A split AAV PE platform will be developed to maximize
prime editing efficiency in vivo, then PE gene correction and lung phenotype will be measured in a PI*Z
transgenic mouse model and a clinically-relevant AAT null/PI*Z mouse model. Aim 2 will enhance the
specificity of ABE for in vivo AAT gene correction. Long-term ABE expression can induce off-target editing.
Therefore, new ABE variants will be optimized to increase activity and reduce RNA editing effects, and split
AAV delivery of ABE will be investigated in a PI*Z model. This Aim will also develop self-inactivating ABE to
reduce off-target effects. Aim 3 will characterize and mitigate immune responses to PE and ABE, which harbor
viral reverse transcriptase and bacterial TadA protein, respectively, and Cas9, a known antigen. This Aim will
investigate antibody and T cell response to PE and ABE in mice, how immune response regulates editing, and
whether CAR-Treg can mitigate immune response. Project 2 will benefit from extensive interactions with the
other projects and cores in this P01. Completing this project will improve the efficiency and safety of PE and
ABE in vivo, providing an HDR-independent gene editing blueprint for AATD, and other monogenic diseases."
10914227,"Project 4 - Abstract
In Project 4, we will use our novel adeno-associated virus (AAV) directed chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR) T-cells and T regulatory cells (Tregs) to modulate and mitigate immune
responses to AAV gene therapy for alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) disease. We have shown that our
AAV CARs can clear AAV transduced cells similar to what was observed in the early
Hemophilia trials and our AAV-CAR Tregs are able to allow modulate anti- capsid and anti-
transgene immune responses allowing for stable and persistent transgene expression. We will
optimize our current AAV CAR Treg construct and protocols to make the most suppressive and
functional CAR Tregs. Then we will further characterize the suppressive function of our AAV
CAR T-regs in response to the immunogenic rh32.33 capsid in mouse models. We will further
determine if they are able to overcome pre-existing immunity to capsid which is a large issue for
clinical gene therapy due to the large number of patients who have pre-existing immunity to
AAV. And, we will study if AAV CAR T-regs can overcome pre-existing immunity to transgenes
like those involved in CRISPR genome editing, as again most patients have immune response
to CRISPR proteins causing the likelihood of survival of edited cells to be limited. We will also
determine if AAV CAR T-regs can allow for re-dosing of AAV vectors, allowing for multiple
doses of AAV gene therapy to be delivered to reach optimal therapeutic expression. In addition,
we will further characterize the modulation of the immune system to immunogenic transgenes
by AAV CAR Tregs allowing for stable immunogenic transgene expression. Finally, we will
characterize the immune responses to AAV delivery by in ferrets, a novel model in the AAV field
regarding immune responses. We will investigate how well the ferret model recapitulates the
observations in the clinic and whether capsid specific cytotoxic and/or T-regulatory cells are
generated after systemic or intramuscular injection of ferrets. Overall this project will allow us to
learn considerably about the immune responses generated after AAV gene therapy and allow
us to develop powerful tools to modulate and mitigate immune responses that are relevant for
clinical gene therapy development."
10927302,"Proteomics Core – Project Summary
The broad objective of the Proteomics Core in the SC COBRE in Oxidants, Redox Balance, and Stress Signaling
(Redox COBRE) is to provide state-of-the-art, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic capabilities to enable
elucidation of redox signaling mechanisms underlying disease, therapeutic efficacy of cells and drugs, and
therapeutic resistance. The Core provides expertise, technical assistance, instrumentation, and interpretation of
analytical results for quantitative proteomic experiments and the characterization of redox-sensitive post-
translational modifications. During Phase I and II, acquisition of the Orbitrap Elite ETD MS and Orbitrap Fusion
Lumos ETD/UVPD MS nano-LC-MS/MS systems (NIH S10 OD010731 and S10 OD025126, PI: Lauren Ball)
permitted detection of challenging modifications using complementary peptide fragmentation approaches (ETD
and EThcD) and the development of advanced, quantitative proteomic workflows as needed by COBRE
investigators. During Phase III, the Core will further develop and update these capabilities to reflect rapid
advances in instrumentation, software, and methodologies relevant to redox proteomics. Additionally, in
response to the needs of COBRE-affiliated investigators, proteomic tissue imaging capabilities using MALDI-
Imaging MS (IMS) will be provided to discern the spatial distribution of enzymatically-digested peptides within
tissue biospecimens on slides for the discovery of putative biomarkers and mechanisms underlying disease
progression. Detection of disease-specific proteins and redox-sensitive post-translational modifications by LC-
MS/MS and IMS has raised the need for targeted proteomic capabilities to verify these findings and further
advance translational studies. Providing this complement of proteomic technologies will build on the successes
of the Core and position the Core to establish a comprehensive, independent resource. The Core has leveraged
previous investments made by the NIGMS during Phase I and II of the COBRE program, the OD and NIGMS for
Shared Instrumentation Grants, the NCI Cancer Center Support Grant, and long-standing, strong institutional
commitment to develop into a successful institutional resource critical to the needs of Redox COBRE
investigators. At present there are 19 COBRE-affiliated users of the Proteomics Core that are PIs of 15 active
NIH awards that rely on the LC-MS/MS capabilities, five of these awards also depend on IMS capabilities."

10880336,"Project Summary/Abstract 
The ongoing goal of the Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT) is to establish 
electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking (ET) biomarkers that can be used for stratification and/or as 
sensitive and reliable objective assays related to social function in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) clinical trials. 
This renewal application seeks to further validate promising measures through three studies designed to 
enhance and extend the original ABC-CT study: (1) a confirmation study of the original findings in a new cohort 
using similar design (T1: Baseline, T2: 6 weeks post baseline, T3: 24 weeks post baseline) and sample 
size/characteristics (200 with ASD, 200 with typical development (TD)); (2) a follow-up study of the original cohort 
(N=399) to re-administer the biomarker and clinical batteries 2.5-4 years after original ABC-CT enrollment; (3) a 
feasibility study of parallel EEG and ET biomarkers in preschool-aged (3-5-year-old) children (25 with ASD, 25 
with TD). The biomarker and clinical batteries measure key facets of social-communication in ASD using well- 
validated paradigms appropriate for the intended developmental and cognitive range. The study will rely on the 
same leadership and five Collaborating Implementation Sites (“Sites”) from the first phase, all highly experienced 
in multi-site collaborative clinical research using the proposed clinical, EEG, and ET methodologies. The Data 
Coordinating Core (DCC) will provide a secure informatics infrastructure for communication and data integration 
across the consortium to ensure organized data management, quality control, and reliable upload to the National 
Database for Autism Research (NDAR) and NIH Data Repositories. The Data Acquisition and Analysis Core 
(DAAC) will oversee consistent use of scientific standards and methodological rigor for data acquisition, 
processing, and analytics. The Administrative Core, in coordination with federal partners in this cooperative 
agreement, will oversee the operations of the sites, DCC, and DAAC to ensure methodologically and ethically 
rigorous, efficient completion of study aims: 1) In the confirmation study with a new cohort, evaluate whether 
EEG and ET measures, individually or in combination, have utility as stratification biomarkers and/or sensitive, 
reliable measures of change in clinical trials; 2) In the follow-up study of the original ABC-CT cohort, assess 
long-term stability, sensitivity to change, and longitudinal predictive value of the markers; 3) In the feasibility 
study, determine the viability of parallel EEG and ET measures as potential biomarkers in 3-5-year-old children 
with ASD and TD. Blood (DNA) samples will be collected from participants with ASD and biological parents for 
future genomic analyses, and raw, processed, and analyzed data will be shared to create a community resource 
accessible for use by all qualified investigators. These objectives are designed to further develop promising 
biomarkers to advance qualification with the FDA Biomarker Qualification Program."
10839778,"SUMMARY OF THE CLINICAL CORE
The over-arching goal of the Core will be to provide research diagnostic evaluations for a large clinical
population with a special emphasis on participants who are followed longitudinally and tracked to autopsy to
provide well-characterized participants for the research projects conducted by ADRC investigators and
collaborators. Important focuses of the Clinical Core—as for the Yale ADRC broadly—include cellular
neuroscience, synaptic mechanisms, and an emphasis on systematic storage of biospecimens for current and
future biomarker studies. The importance of neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers for AD diagnosis and
therapeutic development is increasing well appreciated, and recent research has emphasized the importance
of classifying patients according to the presence of β-amyloid deposition, pathologic tau, and
neurodegeneration (ATN). The Yale ADRC Imaging, Biomarker, and Neuropathology Cores and specific
Developmental Projects will seek to develop these methods with relevance to AD and related disorders. In
partnership with these efforts, the Clinical Core will undertake the collection of a wide range of imaging studies
and fluid biomarker specimens across the full spectrum of AD cross-sectionally and during the full course of
AD longitudinally. Aim 1 will maintain the Core Population through enrollment of 250 new participants on the
full continuum of AD (from preclinical to dementia), as well as non-AD dementias and normal controls. Aim 2
will enroll these participants in the Uniform Data Set (UDS) population and make the UDS measures available
to the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) for national studies. Aim 3 will enroll subjects into the
Autopsy Program. Aim 4 will provide appropriate subjects for the clinical studies affiliated with the ADRC. Aim
5 will collect biological specimens for Yale ADRC and other researchers for biomarker studies. Aim 6 will assist
the Research Education Core in training future clinical and translational researchers in AD and related
disorders. These Aims will provide ADRC affiliated investigators the ready ability to test biomarkers—once
validated in AD dementia—in the earliest stages of AD pathogenesis."
10916270,"The mitochondrion is the major energy-producing organelle of the cell and coordinates key activities such
as signaling, apoptosis, and phospholipid synthesis. These processes are essential for survival and
pathogenesis of Candida albicans, the most common fungal pathogen in humans. C. albicans respiration
occurs via three distinct pathways compared to vertebrates and is associated with virulence properties such
as morphogenesis and cell wall synthesis. Our long-term research goal is to understand the cellular and
molecular mechanisms that govern C. albicans survival in response to environmental stress and antifungal
drugs. We previously discovered that gene classes involved mitochondrial functions are highly transcribed
in response to osmotic and cell wall stress, and the gene SLP3 (stomatin like protein 3) was significantly
upregulated. SLP3 is a member of the conserved SPFH (Stomatin, Prohibitin, Flotillin, HflK/HflC) protein
superfamily. In eukaryotes, SPFH proteins are required for essential mitochondrial processes such as
respiration, mitophagy, and apoptosis and mediate pathogenicity in several parasites. Our objective in this
proposal is to determine the role of the C. albicans SPFH protein family in mitochondrial function. We were
the first to demonstrate that Slp3p overproduction disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential and
triggered apoptotic-like death specifically following prolonged exposure to oxidative stress. However, the
molecular function Slp3p remains unknown. Thus, our central hypothesis is that C. albicans SPFH proteins
form membrane complexes to coordinate mitochondrial function. This hypothesis is based upon
observations with mammalian SPFH proteins and our published and preliminary findings. Human SPFH
complexes appear as punctate foci when viewed using fluorescence microscopy. We found that Slp3p form
puncta at the plasma membrane. Further, we identified a mitochondrial targeting signal in Slp2p, Phb1p and
Phb2p, and our Slp2p-GFP fusion protein formed mitochondrial puncta. We will utilize a high-throughput
molecular genetic and cellular approach that is cost-effective and time-saving to determine SPFH protein
localization, protein complex composition, cellular function, and role in C. albicans infection. We will create
SPFH-GFP fusion proteins and use fluorescence microscopy to determine cellular localization. We will
construct SPFH-epitope-tagged strains and perform Co-IP and LC-MS/MS analyses to identify putative
SPFH protein binding partners. We will create SPFH mutants via CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and
phenotypically characterize mutant strains in growth and cellular assays. We will examine SPFH function in
C. albicans pathogenesis using a novel invertebrate infection system. Our findings will address a poorly
understood area in C. albicans biology and provide a model for studying SPFH proteins in pathogenic fungi.
This proposal is innovative as we will characterize the SPFH family in the context of a critical, yet poorly
understood area in C albicans biology: the molecular framework underlying mitochondrial function."
10839781,"The Biomarker Core will play a key role in the proposed Yale ADRC by managing the Biospecimen
Repository consisting of both standard and novel biospecimens, and through the development and application
of cutting-edge proteomic and epigenetic assays and bioinformatics approaches to integrate high-dimensional

facilitate the development and validation of promising biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) susceptibility,
improve AD risk prediction, and identify promising directions for development of targeted interventions. The
Biomarker Core will work closely with the Data Management and Statistics Core (DMSC) in the management
of the Biospecimens Repository. We will also facilitate the integration of multi-omics data with data generated
by the Clinical and Imaging Cores to assess and validate both standard and novel biomarkers aimed at
capturing AD heterogeneity, susceptibility, and progression. We will work with the DMSC to utilize statistical
modeling of cognitive trajectories and decline, and/or considerations of mortality selection or other biases when
evaluating the reliability, validity, and generalizability of AD-related biomarkers. Finally, we will work with the
Education Component and Outreach Core to facilitate training and outreach in AD Biomarker acquisition and
use. Specific Aims include: Aim 1: Manage Yale ADRC Biospecimen Repository. Working closely with the
Clinical, Neuropathology, and DMS Cores, and NCRAD, we will manage the Yale ADRC biorepository and
provide biospecimens to ADRC and non-ADRC investigators. Aim 2: Assess, track and validate biofluid and
tissue biomarkers of AD. We will use standardized ELISA-based assays for Abeta1-40, Abeta1-42, t-tau and p-
tau in CSF in existing and future biofluid samples from Yale ADRC Biorepository, as well as utilize state-of-the-
art targeted mass spectrometric assays to analyze selected biomarkers in biofluid and brain tissue from the
Yale ADRC Biorepository and other ADRC-affiliated research projects. Aim 3: Assess, track and validate
systems-level biomarkers based on high-dimensional omics data. We will assess DNA methylation (DNAm) in
biofluids from the Yale ADRC Biorepository and other ADRC-affiliated research projects, and use it to calculate
both validated and novel biomarker measures of epigenetic age and AD heterogeneity. Working with the
DMSC, we will use systems biology approaches to integrate the DNAm and proteomic data with data available
via the Clinical and Imaging Cores. Aim 4: Facilitate training and Outreach in AD Biomarker acquisition and
use."
10839783,"SUMMARY – Yale ADRC Neuropathology Core
The neuropathological assessment of brains provides a critical resource and asset for disease-oriented
neuroscience by connecting clinical, biomarker-based, genetic and neuroimaging observations to pathogenic
tissue-based changes. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) research was enhanced by thorough neuropathological studies
uncovering closely inter-related histopathological features with other defined neurodegenerative diseases and/or
co-morbidities such as cerebrovascular disease and hippocampal sclerosis. Precise postmortem diagnosis is
therefore critical for validating candidate antemortem biomarkers and imaging characteristics. The Yale ADRC
Neuropathology Core has been designed to enhance research within the Yale ADRC and to promote tissue-
based Alzheimer Disease research throughout the neurodegenerative disease research community. The
biobanking of AD brains will be supplemented by the parallel collection of skin or dura derived fibroblasts from
deceased individuals, which will be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSC). This approach leads
to uniquely paired samples that allow the directed investigation of neurodegenerative disease processes in
frozen/fixed brain samples while also providing a cell culture model of the same individual. Further, Yale is home
to a large aged rhesus colony due to decades of pre-eminence of non-human primate (NHP) neuroscience. The
incorporation of NHP brains the for assessment of age-related neurodegeneration in rhesus macaque will allow
correlation of AD pathology and imaging across species, and it will provide high quality tissue samples for high
resolution ultrastructure due to due to a well-controlled, minimal postmortem interval. The Neuropathology Core
will also closely interact with other Cores of the Yale ADRC.
The overarching goal of this application is to develop and establish a highly contemporary biobank, which merges
traditional biobanking approaches with advancements in stem cell technology for the analysis of Alzheimer’s
Disease, and also offers access to well-studied aged NHP brain tissue. Successful completion of these goals
will have a major impact on the overall success of the Yale ADRC."

Cores to engage and retain participants. We will enhance our educational efforts with the general public
through our collaboration with the Connecticut Chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association, the Yale Geriatric
Workforce Enhancement Program, and other community-based organizations. We have developed a
mechanism for tracking individuals seeking information on Alzheimer’s disease from a variety of sources. We
will fully operationalize, implement, and evaluate this model to track interested individuals, engage study
participants, and adapt our outreach efforts to identify and meet the information needs of potential participants.
We will educate and recruit minority participants through our interaction with local Federally Qualified Health
Centers, and the Cultural Ambassador Program of the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation (YCCI), as well as
develop a new ADRC Community Advisory Board to identify community leaders who can help advocate for
research participation and facilitate bi-directional information flow with the community. In continuing our
educational efforts for health care providers, we will focus on expanding dementia education to primary care
clinicians in the Northeast Medical Group practice network, who care for over 190,000 patients throughout
Connecticut, as well as eastern New York and Rhode Island. We will work with the Geriatric Workgroup of the
Yale New Haven Health System, in which the Northeast Medical Group participates, in these efforts. We will
assist the leaders of this group to develop protocols for cognitive assessment, identify community resources,

programs."
10839920,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Preventive genomic medicine, particularly identification of individuals with inherited cancer risk, provides health
systems with the opportunity to improve longevity and quality of life for their patients. The ability to uncover
substantially elevated risk of disease through genomic testing, act to reduce that risk, and improve outcomes
while lowering costs has been the longstanding promise of genomic medicine. In the case of inherited cancer,
however, adherence to recommended risk management following genomic testing is low. Further, our pilot
data suggests that health systems are reluctant to expand cancer genomic testing without a clearer idea of
how to manage tested patients over time. Our goal in this application is to address this roadblock to genomic
medicine implementation. Specifically, we will demonstrate the benefits that adopting population management
interventions following genomic testing can provide health systems, using hereditary cancer as a case
example. We will revise and rigorously evaluate two population management interventions (web resources and
personalized outreach) that improve timely patient outreach and end-to-end tracking without burdening
providers. Web resources is a low-touch intervention that links patients with existing educational resources
(e.g., the Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered website). Personalized outreach is a high-touch intervention
that connects patients with a dedicated care manager to discuss risk management and provide care reminders.
Both interventions are highly scalable and mirror population management programs that health systems have
used to support cancer screening, diabetes management, and other evidence-based care for decades. We will
compare web resources and personalized outreach to usual care in a pragmatic hybrid type-1 randomized trial
that engages patients captured in hereditary cancer registries within two health systems, Kaiser Permanente
Northwest (KPNW) and Denver Health (DH). KPNW is a vertically integrated health system and DH is a
federally qualified health center, providing two highly unique evaluation settings. Our primary effectiveness
outcome is the proportion of registry patients up to date with recommended cancer screening over two years.
We will collect secondary implementation outcomes, including the acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility,
sustainability, and costs of high- and low-touch intervention approaches. By providing clinical champions with
essential data and tools to select and implement population management interventions that address critical
gaps in post-testing quality and patient safety, this innovative project will advance preventive genomic
medicine."

Resource facility that supports every stage of a single-cell genomics project, including experimental design,
protocol development, sample preparation, library construction, sequencing logistics, primary data processing,
and in-depth embedded analysis. Shared Resource personnel frequently work side-by-side with researchers,
customizing the workflow to meet the unique needs of the project. Examples of the most common single-cell
workflows supported by the Shared Resource include: 3’-digital transcriptome profiling, immune receptor
profiling, ATAC-sequencing, copy-number variation, proteogenomics, and single-nucleus RNAseq. In addition to
standard, established protocols, the Shared Resource assists users in designing and executing custom single-
cell workflows with downstream tailored data analysis. The Single-Cell Biology Shared Resource houses and
operates capital equipment for handling most stages of common single-cell workflows. A critical component of
this Shared Resource’s mission is to provide education and training on the analysis of single-cell genomics data.
Semi-annual workshops and regular computational office hours give researchers the opportunity to learn
common computational pipelines and become familiar with emerging techniques in data analysis. Since its
establishment, the Shared Resource has been used by 12 CSHL Cancer Center laboratories (32% of members),
resulting in 5 co-authored publications. In summary, the Single-Cell Biology Shared Resource provides
comprehensive bench-to-publication support of both off-the-shelf and customized genomics workflows,
dramatically streamlining the process of collecting these challenging and high-impact datasets."

 The Cleveland Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (CADRC) is a collaborative effort of investigators
at five Cleveland area institutions: Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Cleveland Clinic Foundation
(CCF), MetroHealth Systems (MHS), University Hospitals (UH), and the Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans
Affairs Medical Center (LSCVAMC). The Administrative Core (AC) of the CADRC has the overall responsibility
for promoting the successful integration of the participating sites and investigators and the successful
completion of the Center's goals. The AC works closely with the other cores to achieve the aims of the CADRC
and milestones of the National Alzheimer's Project Act. In addition, the AC has a unique role in the CADRC of
promoting close collaboration between CADRC investigators, Cores, local neurodegeneration research
investigators, and local community leaders to foster an active center of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-
related dementias (ADRD).The AC has primary responsibility for coordinating and leading CADRC group
activities including weekly AC/administrator meetings, monthly Core leaders meeting, the twice yearly Internal
Advisory Committee (IAC) meetings, and annual External Advisory Committee (EAC) visits. These meetings
review the activities and accomplishments of the cores, ensures timely transmission of CADRC data and
biospecimens to the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and National Centralized Repository for
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD), and fosters additional collaborations between cores
(Specific Aim 1). The AC also provides external support and advice to the CADRC investigators on advancing
the goals and aims of the center (Specific Aim 2) and promotes interactions with other Alzheimer Disease
Research Centers, collaborations and opportunities for additional funding (Specific Aim 4). The AC provides
compliance oversight and obtains/renews centralized institutional review board approval of CADRC activities
(Specific Aim 3). Lastly, the AC oversees and promotes training and support to students, fellows, and junior
faculty through the establishment of an annual Development Project Grant Program (Specific Aim 5)."
10916429,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The mission of the Biomarker Core (BC) is to support Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias
(AD/ADRD) research projects by collecting, storing, tracking, sharing, and analyzing biospecimens and
associated clinical, genetic, and biomarker data. The collected clinical, genetic, and biomarker data on a
variety of human biospecimens will contribute to the understanding of AD/ADRD underlying heterogeneity by
cataloging the onset, progression, and disease symptoms of participant biospecimens currently stored in the
Cleveland Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (CADRC) BC. This information will contribute to improving
diagnosis in unique, understudied populations, as well as the population as a whole. Toward this mission, we
previously established and integrated biospecimen collection and research collaborations between Case
Western Reserve University, Cleveland Clinic, MetroHealth Systems, University Hospitals, and the Louis Stoke
Cleveland VA Medical Center. The aims of the BC are to 1) Facilitate research by leveraging and expanding
the CADRC BC infrastructure and biospecimens linked with participant clinical data in the integrated database
and continue to include longitudinal biospecimen collection, 2) Provide basic biomarker characterization to
facilitate AD/ADRD research, 3) Provide basic genetic characterization to facilitate AD/ADRD research, and 4)
Distribute biospecimens to neurodegenerative disease consortiums and coordinating centers, as well as to
internal and external investigators. Toward these aims, our team of experts will continue to contribute to
biospecimen collection for the CADRC. The establishment of the CADRC BC has provided an essential
infrastructure to facilitate and integrate the independent projects of unique and understudied populations, such
as African Americans, as well as understudied neurodegenerative disorders, including atypical AD and
dementia with Lewy bodies. Standard clinical data (the Uniform Data Set) from these diverse understudied
populations will continue to be linked with generated biomarker and genetic data. Genetic and biomarker data
linked to relevant clinical data in accordance with goals of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) are
shared with the scientific community including the Alzheimer's Disease Genetic Consortium (ADGC), National
Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), and the National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease
Data Storage (NIAGADS). The already established CCLRCBH-Biobank and our highly trained personnel has
insured seamless creation of the CADRC BC. Importantly, the CADRC BC infrastructure is now in place to
facilitate future innovative AD/ADRD research projects that enhances our understanding of the heterogeneity
of AD/ADRD pathology."
10916431,"Project Summary
The theme of the Cleveland Alzheimer's Disease Center (CADRC) is focused on understanding the clinical and
pathologic heterogeneity observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the AD-related dementias (ADRD), which
is in alignment with the broader goal of the National Alzheimer's Plan Act (NAPA). The Clinical Core (CC) and
Clinical Core Registry (CCR), a key resource of the CADRC, focus on several populations that can provide
special insights into this broad goal. The process of meeting this goal encompasses the major activities of the
CC, which include enrolling, characterizing, and following longitudinally a diverse population of older individuals
in the CCR (Specific Aims 1,2). Extensive interactions of the CC with other cores are essential for the function
of the CADRC and to meet this important goal. The diverse populations targeted for furthering this goal include
participants with Mild Cognitive Impairment/AD, dementia with Lewy bodies, Atypical AD dementias (Rapidly
progressive/Cortical Variant AD), and a cohort of cognitively normal controls with a large proportion having at
least one APOE e4 allele. A strong minority recruitment effort spanning multiple community- and clinic-based
approaches is outlined and builds upon the experience of the investigators working with this community, and
across cores, especially the Outreach, Recruitment, and Engagement Core (Specific Aim 6). The CC team
works with the Data Management and Statistics Core to store data to facilitate future research and to share
data with the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center in a timely manner (Specific Aim 5).
The CC is the starting point for collection of biomarker, imaging and post-mortem autopsies to advance our
understanding of brain-behavior relationships by coordination with the Neuroimaging, Biomarker and
Neuropathology Cores. This involves the collection from CCR participants of blood and cerebral spinal fluid
biomarkers, 3T and 7T brain MRI and Amyloid PET imaging, and obtaining consent for post-mortem
neuropathology examination with brain autopsy across all of these diverse cohorts in a culturally sensitive and
efficient manner (Specific Aims 3,4).
The CC is committed to support future Administrative Core development projects and the Translational
Therapeutics Core and the Research Education Component in their mission to support basic scientist
investigators both locally, nationally, and internationally, and training the next generation of basic and clinical
science researchers (Specific Aims 7,8). Overall, the CC contributes to understanding AD in its fullest extent
across cultures and its varied clinical forms, while providing vital infrastructure for the basic, social, and clinical
researchers in our larger medical community."
10916433,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The success of research studies in any human disease, but particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and
AD-related dementias (ADRD), is critically dependent on the collection, generation, management, analysis, and
interpretation of large, varied, and detailed data sets. The overall goal of the Data Management and Statistical
Core (DMSC) is to empower AD/ADRD researchers to acquire, manage, analyze, and interpret their data. To
do this, we leverage existing institutional infrastructure and provide the necessary expertise for the Cleveland
Alzheimer's Disease Center (CADRC). This goal will be accomplished through three specific aims.
 Specific Aim 1 provides a comprehensive data management platform for the collection, aggregation, and
management of the relevant data. We will leverage the infrastructure of the Cleveland Institute for Computational
Biology (CICB), which has developed a safe and secure computational environment for data capture and
management that is available to all the participating institutions (the SHED [Safely Held Electronic Data] data
management system). The SHED uses a tier III secure computational environment along with both
computational and policy access and privacy controls. The system easily integrates a wide variety of data
formats and provides methods for participant and sample tracking for longitudinal studies. Comprehensive
training for CADRC personnel is provided.
 Specific Aim 2 enhances interactivity with the other cores, investigators, and external databases.
Through the efforts of the Administrative Core, participating institutions have institutional agreements to capture
and share electronic data through the SHED. All investigators and staff across the CADRC institutions have
controlled access to the SHED. We have put into place processes internally for interacting with each of the
CADRC cores, and externally for interactions with databases and users such as the National Alzheimer's
Coordinating Center (NACC) and the National Institute for Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage
site (NIAGADS).
 Specific Aim 3 provides biostatistical, study design, and data analysis support to the CADRC. The DMSC
provides support for these activities through access to a wide range of expertise including biostatistical (Drs.
Tatsuoka and Feng), genomic (Drs. Haines and Feng), and imaging (Dr. Tatsuoka). Dr. Feng also brings
expertise in data integration and machine learning to the CADRC. Substantial technical support will be provided
by a master's level analyst.
 The DMSC is well positioned to accommodate the data management and data analysis needs of the
CADRC, its investigators, and the broader AD/ADRD research community."
10916435,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The goals of the Neuropathology Core (NPC) are to perform standardized postmortem
neuropathological evaluation, and classification of subjects recruited by the Cleveland Alzheimer's Disease
Center (CADRC), and to collect, store, and analyze fixed and frozen autopsy materials for use in future
research. Drs. Cohen and Appleby, who bring expertise in the areas of molecular pathology and
clinicopathologic correlation of neurodegenerative disease, will lead the NPC.
 To support AD research projects, the NPC will perform all tissue processing for histology and
freezing, and immunohistochemical investigations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias
(ADRD). The NPC will also characterize archival tissue of AD cases in the brain banks at participating
sites, to more rapidly make available tissues for investigation.
 The goal of the CADRC NPC is to obtain, characterize, and maintain neuropathologic specimens
from subjects affected by AD and related dementias (ADRD). With over two decades of experience in
conducting autopsies from across the country and maintaining neuropathologic tissue, the CADRC NPC will
be maintained via infrastructure that has been proven through the work of the National Prion Disease
Pathology Surveillance Center (NPSPSC) (Specific Aim 1). Experts in the field of neurodegeneration (Drs.
Cohen and Leverenz) will characterize neuropathologic specimens according to accepted standardized criteria
(Specific Aim 2). The CADRC will have access to and will help characterize a unique cohort of ADRD samples
obtained through the NPDPSC (Specific Aim 3). Finally, the NPC will foster the next generation of AD
researchers by training and mentoring junior faculty in neuropathology and current concepts of basic
neuroscience of age-related neurodegenerative diseases (Specific Aim 4). We anticipate the CADRC NPC to
provide essential infrastructure to greatly facilitate and integrate independent research on ADRD that are
currently active at a local, national, and international level."
10847477,"CORE A: Given the size, complexity, duration, and scope involved, Core A will be fundamental
in enabling the successful establishment and operation of the entire program. All costs for
administrative support for the Cores and Projects are included here. Dr. Stokes Peebles will
assume ultimate administrative responsibility for the management of this Core. Administrative,
fiscal services, and clerical support for the entire program will be shared by all Project Leaders,
Core Leaders and Co-Investigators.
This Core will provide and maintain all of the administrative space and functions for the entire
program, including but not limited to, offices for all investigators, an administrative area with
secretarial and administrative support, a copy/work room, and a conference room with up to
date audiovisual amenities. Administrative functions will include ordering of supplies and
equipment, maintenance of all records, keeping and monitoring of budgets, maintenance of the
personnel database for grant effort, interactions with University administrative offices and the
NIH regarding budgetary and other administrative matters, and scheduling and organizing
meetings and presentations. This Core will support all of the computer hardware and software
resources for the administrative and clerical functions of the program.
This Core will coordinate and support the activities of the Internal Advisory Committee and the
External Scientific Advisory Board. The basic functions and objectives of the Core include:
quality management of program resources, integration of the program, oversight of deliverables
within the timeframe, assistance with data management, and leading the vision. To achieve
these objectives, detailed plans are presented for administrative structure and leadership,
project management, external Scientific Advisory Board, and communication/meetings."
10772176,"Most viral infections invoke major changes in host gene expression as part of a broader strategy to create an optimal environment for viral replication. By suppressing host protein synthesis, viruses repurpose the biosynthetic resources of the host cell to maximize the accumulation of viral proteins or nucleic acids and thus ultimately boost the yield of new infectious progeny. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) provides a prime example of this important ‘host shutoff’ phenomenon. HSV-1 infection is accompanied by widescale disruption of host mRNA biogenesis through dysregulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II coupled with changes in mRNA stability, splicing, 3’-end formation, and transcription termination. Although multiple studies have implicated the essential viral regulatory protein ICP27 in aspects of shutoff by HSV-1, the exact mechanisms and their relative contributions remain to be elucidated. Recently, we demonstrated that HSV-1 infection induces widespread changes in the subcellular localization of host nuclear factors required for the installation, removal and recognition of internal RNA modifications including methylation at the N6-position of adenosine (m6A). This results in global reductions in the internal base modifications present on both host and viral RNAs. Importantly, we identified the essential viral regulatory protein ICP27 as both necessary and sufficient for this striking effect. Internal RNA modifications such as m6A influence many aspects of mRNA and lncRNA biogenesis including recognition of hardwired splicing and cleavage/polyadenylation signals, and m6A also regulates the export, stability and translation of mature mRNAs. We observed that viral gene expression is sensitive to loss of m6A at the beginning of the infection cycle but is less impacted at later times, coincident with reduced RNA modification frequency. Drawing these observations together we propose that the poorly understood ability of ICP27 to broadly disrupt host gene expression is mediated, at least in part, by its ability to redefine the epigenetic landscape of the host transcriptome. To understand this better, we will more fully characterize the impact of ICP27 expression on the host machinery responsible for RNA chemical modification and for 3’-end processing and transcription termination. Recent studies reveal a mechanistic linkage between the sites of m6A placement and use of nearby polyadenylation and signals and we hypothesize that this is exploited by ICP27 to bring about a widescale disruption of transcription termination (DoTT) that preferentially impacts the host transcriptome in HSV-1 infected cells. To understand why 3’-end formation of HSV-1 mRNAs is largely insensitive to ICP27- mediated DoTT, we will profile m6A installation across the viral transcriptome to determine the impact of m6A on cleavage and polyadenylation site usage within viral transcription units."
10815740,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent advances in ‘omics-based approaches allow virtually any scientist to perform powerful
genome-wide, transcriptome-wide and proteome-wide analyses of normal tissue, diseasedtissue,
or even single cells. The information provided by these analyses has afforded important insight
into cellular changes that occur as a consequence of development, disease and risk factors
associated with disease, and the identification of potential targets for disease intervention. Yet,
all too commonly, the vast majority of ‘omics studies enable only inferences regarding the ultimate
effect of the observation on protein function. For example, many researchers routinely infer that
an increase in abundance either at the transcript or protein level correlates with a corresponding
increase in that particular protein’s function; but this is not necessarily the case. In reality, the
function of a protein is not simply determined by its mRNA or protein abundance, but rather by
the culmination of the cell’s ability to fold the protein appropriately, traffic it to the proper
cellular/extracellular locale, and the presence of inhibitors, activators, and/or cofactors. To
overcome these inherent limitations of conventional ‘omics approaches, a unique chemical-
biology approach called activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) has been used to provide
functional protein activity data. Towards this end, in this exploratory/developmental project, we
will assess i) the utility of ABPP to determine whether age-related retinal alterations ultimately
affect protein function in a physiologic context and ii) whether we can leverage newly designed,
enzyme-specific ABPP probes to yield real-time enzyme activity in vivo. Successful completion of
this project will positively impact our knowledge of ocular enzymes and will provide additional
tools for interrogating the intricate biology underlying incurable age-related and inherited eye
diseases."

Extracellular vesicles are cell-derived membranous structures harboring a variety of biomolecules. Their
secretion and cargo are determined in part by the physiological or pathological conditions that the parent cell is
exposed to. Recently, increased levels of extracellular vesicles in plasma have been associated with the
pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, but from where those plasma extracellular vesicles originated from, and
whether they affect the development of the disease is still under investigation.
Early in my postdoctoral training, I established a modified protocol to isolate extracellular vesicles from small
tissues, including retina. Using this protocol, I isolated extracellular vesicles of retina explants from nondiabetic
and diabetic mice and found that diabetic retina-derived extracellular vesicles induce ICAM-1, an important
adhesion molecule, in retinal endothelial cells in vitro. This induction is inhibited by pharmacological blockage of
TLR4, a transmembrane protein that has been proposed as an extracellular vesicles cell receptor. I also found
that diabetic retina-derived extracellular vesicles activate circulating leukocytes isolated from nondiabetic
animals. This work laid the foundation of my ongoing research. I want to determine the mechanism(s) of how
retina-derived extracellular vesicles induce ICAM-1 in retinal endothelial cells and activate circulating leukocytes
using a mouse model of diabetes.
I propose 3 specific aims:
Aim 1, To determine if a diabetes-modified visual cycle activity in photoreceptor cells modulates the retina-
derived extracellular vesicles phenotype, which lead to the induction of ICAM-1 in retinal endothelial cells and
activation of circulating leukocytes.
Aim 2, To determine if TLR4 is the common receptor present in retinal endothelial cells and leukocytes and is
triggered upon binding of retina-derived extracellular vesicles, leading to the induction of ICAM-1 in retinal
endothelial cells and activation of circulating leukocytes in diabetes.
Aim 3, To determine if rod-derived extracellular vesicles are key contributors to the retinal vascular pathology
characteristic of diabetic retinopathy.
These studies will be conducted in vivo using mice genetically deficient in key proteins of the visual cycle and
pharmacological means to inhibit extracellular vesicles secretion and TLR4 receptor in diabetes. This proposal
is novel because it focuses on (i) the role of retina (and rod)-derived extracellular vesicles in the pathogenesis
of the retinopathy, (ii) the role of the visual cycle in the cargo sorting of retina (and rod)-derived extracellular
vesicles, and (iii) the role of TLR4 as a receptor of retina (and rod)-derived extracellular vesicles. The insights
learned from these studies can lead to the development of novel and effective targeted therapies to inhibit the
etiopathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy."

 Despite its importance, we do not understand the impact of variation in the regulatory genome on complex
traits. Currently, the field lacks the genetic models necessary to address this relationship systematically, so little
is known about the effect of quantitative variation in gene regulation on quantitative phenotypic output. Tomato
development offers a high-throughput genetic system to address this gap; variation in a tomato enhancer
produces a spectrum of gene expression and quantitative phenotypic output. The rationale of the Research
Training Plan is to use this system to characterize the phenotypic and molecular consequences of genomic
variation at the interface of transcription factor-cis regulatory motif binding.
 In Aim 1, the applicant Dr. Sophia Zebell will train with mentor Dr. Zachary Lippman in quantitative
genetics during the K99 phase, using CRISPR base editing to generate deep sequence variation in cis-regulatory
motifs, and characterizing the molecular and phenotypic consequences of variants with RNA-sequencing,
quantitative phenotyping, and genotype-to-phenotype modeling. In Aim 2, Dr. Zebell will use epistasis analysis
to investigate the quantitative genetic relationship between engineered and natural cis and trans regulatory
variation, complementing genetic experiments with molecular biology to assess transcription factor-DNA binding
affinities to motif variants, including massively multiparallel titration curves and microscale thermophoresis. In
the R00 phase (Aim 3) Dr. Zebell will leverage the genetic interactions characterized in Aim 2 to address genetic
variation in transcription factor DNA-binding domains of different families using a CRISPR-mediated suppressor
screen approach to evolve factors that effectively bind cis-regulatory motif variants. Aim 3 will employ SNP-
SELEX to assess binding of native and evolved transcription factors to pan-genome-wide cis-regulatory SNPs.
 Candidate Dr. Sophia Zebell is trained in the molecular biology of transcription factors, with six
publications since 2013. The Career Development Plan will allow Dr. Zebell to gain new technical skills in high
throughput genetics and genomics, tissue culture and transformation through mentored research and
coursework, and career skills through workshops and practical experience. Mentor Dr. Zachary Lippman is an
expert in genetics who has trained 10 productive postdocs, and Advisory Board members Dr. Joyce Van Eck
(transformation), Dr. Yiping Qi (genome editing), Dr. Yuval Eshed (gene regulation), and Dr. Justin Kinney
(computational biology/biophysics) offer complementary expertise. The highly collaborative, world-class
quantitative genetics research environment of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and the Lippman lab are the ideal
place to acquire this training. In summary, this proposal presents a plan for Research Training and Career
Development to establish Dr. Zebell as an independent investigator while offering insights into an understudied
area of the genome with important implications for a wide variety of human diseases."

Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell dysfunction and damage are hallmarks of age-related macular
degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. While anti-VEGF has revolutionized the
management of wet or exudative AMD, there is currently no treatment available for non-exudative AMD. Aging
is the major risk factor for RPE degeneration and the development of AMD. During aging, epigenetic changes
disrupt ""youthful"" DNA methylation patterns, leading to cellular dysfunction and senescence. Partial epigenetic
reprogramming via ectopic induction of three Yamanaka factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 (OSK), in retinal ganglion
cells was recently reported to reprogram and reverse epigenetic age, leading to vision improvement in aged
mice as well as in a mouse glaucoma model. I propose to test the hypothesis that partial epigenetic
reprogramming can rescue age-related RPE cell degeneration and function in vivo, prevent RPE cell injury
induced by a range of insults in vitro, and inhibit the formation of AMD-like pathologies in a mouse model with
the following aims. (i) To determine whether OSK-mediated epigenetic reprogramming can restore RPE
morphology and function in aged mice, I will examine the visual function and RPE morphology in aged mice
with and without OSK induction by optomotor, ERG, RPE flatmount, and transmission electron microscopy. In
addition, I will compare the transcriptomes and epigenomes of RPE from aged mice with and without OSK
induction to assess the effect of OSK expression. (ii) To test the ability of OSK-induction in rescuing primary
human RPE cells from morphologic and functional changes, as well as cell death following various AMD-
associated insults in vitro, including oxidative stress, ox-LDL, and cigarette smoking extract. I will also examine
the effect of OSK-induction in iPSC-RPE cells derived from high-risk and low-risk donors with AMD. (iii)
Examine the role of OSK induction in NaIO3-treated mice, a short-term injury model that induces regional RPE
atrophy, and in RPE specific aged Cfh heterozygous (Cfh+/-) mice fed with a high fat, high cholesterol diet,
which have pathological changes mimicking early dry AMD. The results of these investigations will reveal the
efficacy and viability of epigenetic reprogramming as a therapeutic strategy for RPE regeneration in vivo. My
mentoring panel and the proposed training plan will equip me with new knowledge and skills to study age-
related retinal diseases and will catalyze my transition to a career as an independent investigator."

The WHO estimates that 1 in 6 people will be 60 years or older by 2030. A hallmark of aging is the
immunological changes that increase susceptibility of this population to inflammatory age-related diseases,
hinder response to infections and vaccines, and lower regenerative capacity. Synthetic biomaterials are used
in multiple ways including drug delivery, vaccines, prosthetics, and scaffolds in tissue engineering to promote
tissue regeneration. The immune system is the first responder to any injury and implants, and it directs the
foreign body reaction (FBR) to these materials—for synthetic materials it is often proinflammatory and leads to
scarring. This immune response is not only dependent on the material itself but both the tissue location and
underlying pathophysiology (patient’s demographic background and health) of the implant site. Thus, the
concept of “biocompatibility” is dependent on the current state of the host immune system which is significantly
influenced by the host’s age and sex. With an aging population there is a critical need to understand how the
age-specific proinflammatory skewed immune system alters the immune response to synthetic material
implants. The goal of this proposed work is to identify key biologic factors in the immune system and target
these with immunomodulatory synthetic materials for use in the aging population for tissue regeneration. The
overarching hypothesis is that the aged immune dysregulation towards an effector state compounds the
adverse reaction to synthetic materials. Using a previously described pro-fibrotic scaffold in a chronic non-
healing wound mouse model, combined with sequencing techniques, and phenotypic analysis, the experiments
in the K99 phase will elucidate the cell-cell communication networks in the aged FBR (Aim 1) as well as the
innate and adaptive immune shifts in response to synthetic materials over lifespan by sex (Aim 2). During the
independent research phase (R00), we will engineer multi-stage synthetic material systems to control the
dysregulated aged immune response in tissue engineering. Developing new immunomodulatory biomaterials is
critical to addressing the FBR to reduce unwanted implant related complications. Completion of this research
will provide training opportunities to master new technical approaches that will prepare the candidate to
become a primary investigator at a top-tier research institution studying the interface of the immune control of
wound healing and aging to synthetic biomaterial-based therapies."

 Bacteriophage (phage) are viruses that infect prokaryotes. Bacteriophage can destroy the bacterial cell
they infect (bacteriolysis), and thereby mold bacterial populations. Our incomplete knowledge of phage
biology, in particular phage-bacterial pairing, the range of bacterial hosts for a given phage, and the effect of an
introduced phage on phage-bacteria community dynamics limits our ability to understand how phage impact
gut health. The human gut contains a highly complex community of bacteria and phage. Alterations in
bacteriophage communities are associated with disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes,
hypertension, and colorectal cancer.
 Stunting (poor linear growth) adversely affects one-third of the half-billion preschool children in low and
middle-income countries and is associated with ~20% of all-cause deaths before age five. Stunting is believed
to be a consequence of environmental enteric dysfunction (EED). We recently defined the comprehensive gut
virome and the bacterial gut microbiome in a longitudinal cohort of rural Malawian children with EED.
We found 13 bacteriophage that were differentially associated with linear growth. Twelve of the 13
bacteriophage were associated with subsequent poor growth velocity. Intriguingly, we found an inverse
relationship between bacteria and bacteriophage richness in children with subsequent poor linear growth
(bacteriophage richness diminishes as bacterial richness increases in children with poor growth). Our data
suggest that disruption of the equilibrium between bacteria and bacteriophage communities might impair
childhood linear growth.
 This observation that changes in the phage community are associated with subsequent linear growth is
intriguing as there is currently no way to treat or prevent EED and stunting. Additionally, the pathophysiology
underlying EED is not well understood, and there currently is not a reliable marker of disease. Therefore,
further understanding of these bacteriophage as either drivers or markers of disease would be a significant
advance for the field. We suggest that further characterization, and potentially future manipulation, of these
microbial signatures may reveal novel avenues for prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of EED and stunting.
Here we aim to advance understanding of phage biology, global gut health, and child health and development.
We will identify and grow bacterial host(s) of the phages of interest, culture phages, and further characterize
them. While we propose to apply our methods to study phage in the context of EED, execution of this
approach will also provide a much-needed roadmap for future studies of phage in other disorders."
10837118,"The human body appears left-right (LR) symmetric, but the shape and positioning of internal organs are distinct
at two sides. Defects in laterality such as isomerism (loss of asymmetry), and heterotaxia (a loss of concordance
among the individual organs) are observed in more than 1 in 8000 live births, contribute to pre-term births and
miscarriage, and have significant clinical implications. Our lab has pioneered in the research of the cellular LR
asymmetry using novel in vitro microscale devices and has extensive experience in modeling organ asymmetries
such as cardiac c-looping. We would like to extend our research into studying the overall LR asymmetric body
plan, which is determined by a select group of cells in embryonic development, first identified in Xenopus as the
Spemann-Mangold organizing center. Since then, many studies have explored the functionality of a left-right
organizer (LRO) in various vertebrates, in particular, chick, fish, and mouse. Due to ethical concerns and the 14-
day restriction of culturing human embryos in vitro, the ability of researchers to study the formation of a human
organizer is very limited. Therefore, finding a biomimetic surrogate of the human organizer will be of great interest
to basic science and health care.
Recent rapid scientific advances in basic stem cell biology and organoid engineering have made it possible to
engineer a human organizer for studying LR symmetry breaking. Scientists have demonstrated that human
embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be induced to express known organizer markers, including the Goosecoid
(GSC), with either the culture of embryoid bodies or the patterning of hESCs on 2D micropatterned circles. GSC
is a key organizer marker of LRO known to be conserved across several vertebrate species. The major challenge
now is how we can engineer the cells into highly organized and naturally curved cell sheets with planar
polarization and even with specific localization, structure, and motion of cilia so that the organizer can fulfill its
critical function in symmetry breaking. As a team of well-trained bioengineers and development biologists with
experience and expertise in stem cell biology and LR asymmetry, we are well-equipped to address this problem.
We propose to develop a novel in vitro human organizer model that will utilize organizer differentiation protocols,
a geometrically-control 3D hydrogel culture system, and a stable gradient generator for developmental
morphogens to facilitate the differentiation and structural formation of a human organizer. We will further study
the role of the cellular intrinsic bias, termed cell chirality, in planar cellular polarity (PCP) signaling and its
regulation of the human LRO morphogenesis.
Overall, the proposed study is timely in addressing a very fundamental yet fascinating question regarding the
developmental LR asymmetry. We will not only establish an in vitro 3D platform for studying the human LRO,
but also reveal biophysical mechanisms of PCP and chirality in realizing the critical function of LRO. It will pave
the way towards the further development of screening platforms for teratogens and prenatal drugs."

 Growing bones contain a circumferential anatomical structure called the groove of Ranvier (GOR) that may
contain skeletal stem cells and signaling cells critical to skeletal development. Clinically, the GOR is important
as pediatric fractures involving the GOR (Salter-Harris type II) often affect longitudinal bone growth. However,
the identity and functional properties of cells within the GOR that regulate longitudinal bone growth are not
known. Our preliminary data suggest that Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors (FGFRs) within the GOR
contribute to a “signaling center” that regulates adjacent growth plate chondrocytes and longitudinal bone growth.
This observation establishes a functional link between cells in the GOR and the growth plate and has implications
for the pathogenesis of pediatric physeal fractures. We refer to these poorly defined cells as the “GOR signaling
center”.
 Conditional inactivation of Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 with the Osx-Cre transgene (Osx-Cre, DCKO mice) results in
decreased longitudinal bone growth in postnatal mice. Through an unknown feedback mechanism, this
inactivation also results in increased Fgf9 expression in the fibrous capsule and perichondrium, which is in close
proximity to the GOR. Experimentally, we showed that expression of FGF9 in the perichondrium can activate
FGFR3 in adjacent proliferating chondrocytes to suppress chondrogenesis.
 By regulating the expression of Osx-Cre, we show that Cre must be active during embryonic development
to elicit this postnatal growth phenotype. Significantly, embryonic, but not postnatal, expression of Osx-Cre
specifically targets the GOR. These data functionally define the region encompassing the GOR as the location
of a critical FGFR1/2 signaling center by showing that inactivation of Fgfr1/2 in an embryonic cell lineage that
gives rise to the GOR, rather than in definitive osteoblasts, is responsible for the dramatic reduction in bone
growth observed in Osx-Cre, DCKO mice.
 In specific aim 1, we will use lineage tracing to differentially label the GOR and single cell mRNA sequencing
to identify cell sub-populations within the GOR that have signaling center and/or skeletal stem cell properties.
Identification of selective markers for these cell sub-populations will be used to reveal their location relative to
the anatomical GOR. In specific aim 2, we will characterize the signaling properties of GOR cells for their ability
to regulate osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. The studies proposed here will identify unique features of GOR
cells as a potential cell signaling center with the unique ability to regulate adjacent growth plate tissue. These
studies will provide mechanistic insight into why a large percentage of pediatric physeal fractures result in growth
arrest despite theoretically preserving the proliferating chondrocytes and their intact blood supply. These studies
will provide new genetic tools to study the GOR in future grant proposals and potential therapeutic insight that
could be used to prevent growth arrest associated with physeal fractures."
10909848,"Abstract: Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is the second leading cause of
dementia behind Alzheimer's disease (AD), and is a frequent co-morbidity with AD. Furthermore, the deleterious
effect of vascular pathologies combined with AD pathology leads to increased likelihood of dementia. Despite
the importance of VCID, little is known about its molecular mechanisms underlying vascular and cognitive
dysfunction. This has led the NIH to prioritize studies examining vascular contributions to dementia, and its
interplay with AD. Chronic psychosocial stress is a risk factor of VCID. Our preliminary data showing that chronic
stress leads to considerable cerebrovascular and neuroinflammatory changes that have similar fundamental
changes evident in the progression of AD has led us to focus on this process. Endothelial dysfunction is a critical
determinant of vascular disease and predictor of clinical events. Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is a major
source of oxidative products (hydrogen peroxide and superoxide) and uric acid. The liver is the site of greatest
XOR activity and the main source of circulating XOR activity. As such, XOR can negatively affect the vasculature.
Our preliminary data suggest that chronic stress increases XOR activity resulting in cerebrovascular dysfunction
and increased inflammation leading to cognitive impairment. Our central hypothesis is that chronic stress
elevates hepatic XOR, which is released into the circulation directly causing cerebrovascular dysfunction and
the activation of inflammation via a TLR4 pathway resulting in cognitive decline which accelerates dementia/AD
pathology. Aim 1 uses a liver (hepatocyte)-and endothelial-specific XOR conditional KO (HXdh-/-) mouse and a
liver-specific XOR overexpression tool to manipulate the XOR pathway during 8 weeks of chronic stress and to
examine the pathology of VCID. In Aim 2, we will use the global-and- endothelial-specific TLR4-/- mouse, along
with physiological approaches to manipulate the TLR4/NF-κB pathway, again in the context of chronic stress
and determine VCID pathology. In Aim 3, we will use the increase in XOR activity with chronic stress and switch
its bad oxidative products to nitric oxide by supplementing with nitrite and determine its actions on the pathology
of VCID. Complementary experiments will also examine the interaction of VCID and AD, by manipulating the
XOR pathway (using febuxostat) and determining if we can delay the pathological progression of AD (3xTg-AD
mice). Pilot data support this hypothesis. Thus, the overall goal of these studies is to determine the etiology of
the stress-related XOR and pro-inflammatory changes in mediating VCID, and its progression to AD pathology.
The studies will fill gaps identified by the NIH regarding the need for understanding of vascular contributions to
cognitive impairment and dementia."
10893045,"The long-term goal of this project is to determine the consequences of cell-type specific expression of
ion channel and neuromodulator receptor genes on primate neocortical function. The human brain is
composed of an astonishing number of cell types. Molecular profiling suggests that upwards of ~75 unique
neuronal cell types reside in a given neocortical area, and that each area has exclusive types. How do
differences in gene expression translate into a neuron’s phenotypic identity? Solving this problem is crucial
because several emerging lines of evidence suggest that human brain disorders may have cell type-specific etiologies, wherein different classes of neurons make distinct contributions to the pathophysiology
of the disease.
 We propose to examine in human and nonhuman primates how mRNA expression in two broad
categories of neocortical infragranular pyramidal neurons translates into their unique physiology,
morphology and response to neuromodulation. Employing a state-of-the-art patch clamping
technique, Patch-seq, we can genetically identify physiologically probed neurons from human and non-human primate neocortex. We test hypotheses about how specific ion channels and neuromodulator
receptors shape the unique input-output properties of these neurons. We also utilize viral tools to
prospectively label neurons, in particular the layer 5 (L5) extratelenephalic (ET)-projecting neurons (which
send axonal projections to subcerebral regions). Several types of L5 ET neurons are not found in the
rodent brain (e.g., Betz cells of motor cortex).
 Three factors make this proposal especially relevant for human health and disease. First, L5 ET
neurons represent the sole direct output of the neocortex to many subcerebral structures and are
implicated in several neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS). Second, we will be directly working in non-human primate and human brain slices rather than the
traditional rodent models. The latter point is especially pertinent given recent published findings of major
differences in murine and human pyramidal neuron physiology. Experiments with monkey tissue will
provide direct access to long-range axonal projection targets in vivo (which isn’t feasible for human brain
slices), as well as the ability to study brain areas rarely available in the human from surgical specimens
(e.g., primary motor cortex). Finally, this proposal lays the foundational knowledge necessary for eventual
development of cell type-specific genetic and pharmacological treatment of disease."
10931526,"Project Summary/Abstract
Loss of function and viability of rod photoreceptors is central to the etiology of retinitis pigmentosa
(RP) which affects 1 in ~4,000. Our lab has a long-term interest in understanding the endosome's role
in membrane trafficking of photoreceptors and much has been learned about the outer segment
protein targeting. In contrast, we know very little about how the mistrafficked proteins are degraded,
and the consequence(s) of the generation of non-degradable wastes. Emerging studies showed the
endo-lysosomal system is a genetic hot spot for several neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's
and Parkinson's, whose pathology is contributed by both the primary neuronal lesions and sustained
microglial inflammation. During the past grant period, we generated a mouse line with rod-specific
deletion of VPS35. The early endosomal protein VPS35 is the hub that centrally controls several
interconnected trafficking pathways. VPS35 has been genetically linked to Alzheimer's and
Parkinson’s. Our results showed that in these mutant mice several outer segment proteins were
mislocalized and underwent proteolytic degradation. Strikingly, VPS35 deficient rod terminals
accumulated massive lipid-membrane wastes, which were engulfed by the surrounding microglia,
which then migrated away to the subretinal space. The latter expressed the molecular signatures of
disease-associated microglia identified in Alzheimer's mouse models. The level of sphingolipid, which
has been connected to synaptic membrane integrity and neural inflammation, was also abnormally
elevated in mutant mice. The overarching goal here is to test a central hypothesis that the engulfment
of the rod-derived sphingolipid-rich wastes activates microglia, leading to several functional deficits
(e.g., phagocytosis, clearance) and inflammation. We will mechanistically investigate the pathological
contribution by sphingolipids (Aim1) and microglia (Aim2) using interdisciplinary and state-of-the-art
techniques (e.g., lipidomics, transcriptomes, 3D electron microscopy, multi-antigen flow cytometry)
both in vivo and in vitro. We will also address whether inhibiting any of these pathways can offset the
sustained microglial inflammation, and in turn, ameliorate retinal pathology. The proposed studies will
provide keen insights into the fundamental understanding of the retina homeostasis harnessed by the
photoreceptor-microglia crosstalk. They have a high potential to lead to new strategies for treating RP
and potentially other neurological diseases with overlapping etiologies."
10830427,"Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that a first birth before age 25 lowers breast cancer (BCa) risk, while a
first birth after age 35 increases BCa risk. This age-dependent impact of first birth on BCa risk is generally
attributed to the pregnancy itself, with much less consideration for the lactation that often ensues. In young women,
evidence is strong that both pregnancy itself and lactation decrease BCa risk. However, the relative contribution of
pregnancy vs. lactation to increased BCa risk associated with a late-age reproduction has not been studied
rigorously, either epidemiologically or experimentally. Lactation itself at any age is assumed to be beneficial to both
mothers and infants, and is encouraged. However, our preliminary data suggest the hypothesis that lactation
instigates preexistent early lesions to progress to cancer. Given the increasingly large population of women who
choose to delay their first pregnancy to age 35 or older when the chance of having accumulated early lesions is
heightened, our hypothesis, if proven, has important and immediate implications for these women and especially
for women have been diagnosed with atypia. They can use this knowledge to make informed decisions regarding
whether and how long they will breastfeed. We will test this hypothesis and study the underlying molecular
mechanism by pursuing three aims: Specific Aim 1. To further elucidate the impact of pregnancy vs. lactation on
breast cancer risk of preexistent mammary early lesions. Specific Aim 2. To investigate how lactation modulates
the progression path of precancerous lesions. Specific Aim 3. To further elucidate lactation-induced changes in
precancerous lesions."

 Genome editors have extraordinary potential to become curative, genomic medicines, but require special
scrutiny because unintended ‘off-target’ mutations may be permanent and affect long-term patient safety. Of
broad concern is that off-target mutations could activate proto-oncogenes, similar to DNA-integrating viral vectors
for gene therapy which have caused leukemia in several patients. For increasing numbers of promising
therapeutic genome editing strategies, there remains a critical need for optimized and qualified cellular assays
to: 1) define the genome-wide activity of targets to inform lead target identification and 2) to functionally
characterize the genome-wide activity of editors during the course of investigational new drug (IND) enabling
chemistry, manufacturing, and control (CMC) activities. To our knowledge, the most commonly used method to
define cellular genome-wide activity of editors for IND applications is GUIDE-seq, a sensitive and unbiased
method we previously developed to define the cellular genome-wide activity of genome editing nucleases. As
part of our Somatic Cell Genome Editing (SCGE) phase 1 project, we developed GUIDE-seq-2, a new version
of GUIDE-seq with improved scalability and accuracy. The objective of this proposal is to optimize, refine, and
qualify GUIDE-seq-2 as a fit-for-purpose assay for evaluation of therapeutic genome editors or associated
genome edited cellular drug products in regulatory submissions. We propose the following specific aims: 1)
Optimize and qualify GUIDE-seq-2 to assess cellular genome-wide activity for IND applications and 2) Apply
GUIDE-seq-2 in novel, therapeutically relevant contexts. Together, the expected outcomes of our proposed
studies will be an optimized and qualified GUIDE-seq-2 assay that can be directly approlied to establish critical
quality attributes of human genome editing products in IND submissions. We envision that the optimized GUIDE-
seq-2 protocol we developed and roadmap for assay qualification will become rapidly widely adopted and have
a broad positive impact on development and translation of safe and effective genomic medicines."
10823298,"Multiple myeloma (MM) comprises 20% of all hematologic malignancies, second only to non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, with 34,470 new cases and 12,640 deaths expected in 2022. Despite new therapeutics, MM remains
incurable for almost all patients. The primary cause of treatment failure is upregulation of pro-survival
mechanisms and progressively greater therapy resistance - thus defining these pro-survival responses will
identify key therapeutic targets. The PIM family of serine/threonine kinases (PIM1, PIM2 and PIM3) have been
shown to be oncogenic and overexpressed in a wide range of solid and hematological malignancies, with the
highest level of PIM2 overexpression seen with MM disease progression. PIM kinases are constitutively active,
and because the mRNA and protein have short half-lives their biological activity is dictated by regulation of their
expression. Importantly, it is currently assumed that biological effects of PIM kinases are entirely due to their
kinase activity. Bringing this assumption into question, we recently reported that the first-in-class PIM2-selective
non-ATP-competitive inhibitor JP11646 (JP) caused significantly greater suppression of MM proliferation and
viability compared to ATP-competitive PIM kinase inhibitors that equivalently inhibited PIM2 kinase activity. We
found that JP’s increased efficacy was not due to superior inhibition of kinase activity, but rather to an unexpected
downregulation of PIM2 gene and protein expression that did not occur with the ATP-competitive PIM2 kinase
inhibitors. These observations led to our central hypothesis that PIM2 has critical but previously unrecognized
kinase-independent (Ki) pro-survival function in MM – including maintaining high constitutive expression of the
PIM2 gene. Preliminary studies have found that kinase-dead PIM2 mutants retain significant pro-survival activity.
Mechanistically, we found that PIM2 stably interacts with the oncogene cMYC in MM cells and increases cMYC
binding to several gene promoters - including PIM2 itself. Moreover, a cMYC inhibitor downregulated PIM2
expression, suggesting a novel auto-regulatory loop where PIM2 stabilizes cMYC binding and trans-activation
of the PIM2 promoter – JP, but not ATP-competitive PIM kinase inhibitors, disrupts this loop. Additionally, we
found that SLC25A11 and UCP2 – two genes coding mitochondrial metabolite transporters – are regulated by
PIM2-cMYC axis in MM. Consistent with this, JP treatment or PIM2 knockdown selectively disrupted oxidative
mitochondrial respiration, which we show is dependent on fatty acid oxidation (FAO). We propose to test a novel
model of SLC25A11 and UCP2 overexpression reprogramming MM metabolism to favor FAO and promoting
MM survival. Since JP has similar effects in acute myeloid leukemia and in solid tumors, PIM2 Ki function in MM
may also occur to other cMYC-driven cancers. As such, inhibition of PIM2 Ki function may be a broadly applicable
approach to target oncogenic cMYC activity. The Specific Aims proposed are: 1). To determine the kinase-
independent mechanisms by which PIM2 supports MM survival, 2). To elucidate PIM2 auto-regulation in MM
cells, and 3).To establish how PIM2 regulates MM metabolism independent of its kinase activity.

Genetic recombination is an essential biological process that is central to the repair of DNA damage that
occurs during replication and other assaults on the genome. Unrepaired double-strand breaks (DSBs) are one
of the most lethal kinds of DNA damage and their aberrant repair often leads to genome instability, one of the
hallmarks of cancer. The damage can occur from endogenous sources, such as oxidation, or from external
sources, such as gamma rays. Genetic recombination is also the mechanism for gene replacement and the
repair of CRISPR-Cas-induced DSBs, processes that are commonly used to study all diseases in humans as
well as human disease models in simpler systems. In this proposal, the mechanisms by which DSBs are
repaired will be explored in vivo in yeast cells using a combination of cell biology, genetics and molecular
biology. A system to study the repair of the two ends of a DSB has been designed to allow, for the first time, a
view into the fate of these ends during the recombination process in diploid cells. This system will be used to
assess chromosome end movement during the repair process in both wild type and mutant genetic
backgrounds. The DSBs will be introduced at the same site using three different endonucleases that create 3’
overhangs, 5’ overhangs or blunt ends to determine how the repair system processes these different lesions.
These same ends will be examined for repair using molecular biological techniques designed to measure (1)
end resection, an important step in preparing the DSB end for recombination and (2) the repair synthesis
stimulated at the end, which is a necessary step on the path to repair of the break. Another system will be
designed to permit in vivo visualization of the first appearance of a successfully recombined chromosome
using messenger RNA as surrogate. This system will be combined with various mutations in recombination
genes to define when the timing of those gene products are important for the repair of a site-specific DSB.
Broken DNA ends also arise during DNA replication, especially when the DNA polymerase is confronted with a
nick. A system will be designed to induce a site-specific nick and will be used in conjunction with marked
chromosome ends to define the fate of a DSB that is generated after replication of a nick. Finally, the function
of the Rad5 protein, a homolog of the human HLTF that is often overexpressed in cancer cells, will be studied
to determine its role in template switch recombination. It is known that both HLTF and Rad5 are necessary for
recombination during template switch repair, but it is not known whether they are sufficient. By approaching the
study of recombination in a genetically tractable system that is easy to manipulate, insights into the conserved
mechanisms of recombination will be achieved."

The goal of this research project is to investigate new 3D advanced hyperpolarized (HP) 13C-pyruvate MRI
techniques to quantitatively monitor metabolic changes in prostate cancer following stereotactic body radiation
therapy (SBRT) and to study HP 13C + multiparametric 1H MRI for detecting residual/progressive cancer following
RT, addressing current unmet clinical needs. This research trial is important because RT too often causes excess
morbidity without sufficient efficacy and current imaging approaches are inadequate in identifying clinically
significant cancer following RT. FDG-PET imaging is significantly limited in prostate cancer since in the localized
setting, significant excretion in the bladder precludes the ability to adequately detect signal within the prostate
and even in the metastatic setting there is significant heterogeneity of uptake with substantial proportion of non-
FDG avid, yet still metabolically active and growing tumors, for reasons related to intra-cellular uptake and
trapping of the FDG tracer. While we use PSMA-PET, to identify metastatic prostate cancer, it does not provide
the metabolic information on prostate cancer aggressiveness and response to therapy that HP 13C has
demonstrated in preclinical and initial human studies at our and other sites.
Recent patient studies of this emerging imaging approach at multiple sites world-wide have shown repeatable
findings of greatly up-regulated LDH catalyzed pyruvate-to-lactate conversions in cancer using this safe, rapid,
fast <5 min, non-radioactive molecular HP 13C MRI. It has demonstrated not only feasibility, but also valuable
biomedical information at costs similar or less than PSMA-PET and other PET exams. This project aims to study
two groups of patients with multiparametric (mp) 1H MRI with HP 13C-pyruvate MRI (HP 13C mpMRI); 1) Before,
3 months after, and 1 year following SBRT; and 2) patients exhibiting “biochemical failure” indicated by a rising
PSA after radiation therapy who are going on to image-guided biopsies prior to selection of further salvage
treatment. We strengthened this resubmission by addressing the prior critiques and including new preliminary
data applying new improved HP technology. Our multidisciplinary research team has extensive experience in
conducting early phase clinical trials and combines the expertise of prostate cancer imaging scientists with
physician/scientists and radiation oncologists to advance our preliminary studies to translate and investigate new
HP 13C-pyruvate mpMRI techniques for monitoring RT response in order to address important unmet clinical
needs in the treatment of prostate cancer patients."

 Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have produced associations between many thousands of
genetic variants and many hundreds of traits. The “functional effects” of most associations, however, have not
yet been elucidated – that is, the causal variants and effector genes responsible for them, and the tissues and
pathways through which they act, remain largely unknown. Over the past few years, three classes of genomic
data have arisen for inferring the functional effects of GWAS associations: summary association statistics
(effect sizes and p-values for associations between SNPs and traits), genomic annotations (assays of
regulatory activity and genomic functional elements), and bioinformatic methods (computationally predicted
functional effects). We argue that two gaps exist in the current resources that aggregate these data: first, no
current resource aims to comprehensively curate and catalog all that is known, and all data or methods that
could help predict, the functional effects of GWAS associations; second, existing resources are developed with
(at best) limited involvement from experts who either originally generated the genomic data and/or understand
how to best use them. We propose to address these gaps by building a new genomic community resource –
the Association to Function Knowledge Portal (A2FKP) – using a general software platform we initially
developed for type 2 diabetes. Our approach makes use of a key innovation to build a resource that is both
high quality and comprehensive: we collaborate with disease expert communities to build dedicated knowledge
portals for them, motivating them to contribute their data and expertise, and we then integrate these data
alongside those of other communities, providing users with access a comprehensive resource.
Specific aim 1 addresses gaps in the comprehensiveness and quality of the data aggregated by
current resources regarding the functional effects of GWAS associations. It will establish and manage
collaborations with a wide range of disease, data, and method experts, and then work with these communities
to identify, aggregate, and curate data for 11 classes of disease. Specific aim 2 addresses gaps in current
schemas and software platforms for the myriad types of data used for predicting the functional effects of
GWAS associations. It will build pipelines for processing genetic and genomic datasets through bioinformatic
methods for predicting the functional effects of GWAS associations, apply these pipelines to data aggregated
in Aim 1, and transform their outputs to relationships among entities in a knowledge graph. The goal of
specific aim 3 is to provide users with direct and visual access to the resources aggregated or computed in
Aims 1 and 2. It will develop REST APIs and web portals for querying and visualizing data within the A2FKP.
 Significance: The project would produce a high quality and comprehensive genomic resource of data
and methods for predicting the functional effects of GWAS associations. Easy access to such a resource will
accelerate the pace by which GWAS associations can be translated to insights into complex disease."

Heart failure is associated with an annual mortality rate of 300,000 Americans, while over a million experience a
myocardial infarction. Many patients with both heart failure and myocardial infarction also develop ventricular
dyssynchrony, which exacerbates cardiac dysfunction and worsens symptoms. Cardiac resynchronization
therapy (CRT) has emerged as an effective therapy for patients who suffer from heart failure and dyssynchrony,
such as left bundle branch block (LBBB). When CRT is successful, it improves survival by stopping and even
reversing the progression of heart failure. CRT immediately restores electrical and mechanical synchrony of the
healthy myocardium, and over time it reverses dilation of the left ventricle (LV). However, 35-50% of patients fail
to respond to CRT. A major strength of CRT is the ability to tailor the therapy to individual patients with patient-
specific lead locations, timing, and/or pacing protocol, which promises to improve outcome. However, it also
presents a dilemma: there are far too many possible strategies to test during the implantation surgery.
 Given the complex interactions and patient-to-patient differences in anatomy, electrophysiology, infarct
location, myocardial remodeling, and drug regimens, individualized computational models have the potential to
improve CRT outcome by enabling virtual treatment planning and guidance. While computational models of the
acute impact of CRT on electrical or mechanical synchrony exist, none are capable of predicting patient-specific
outcomes and long-term post-CRT cardiac remodeling, and most are too computationally expensive for routine
clinical use. Thus, the specific objective of this proposal is to develop a fast multiscale modeling approach for
patient-specific prediction of CRT outcome in ischemic and non-ischemic LBBB patients that can be integrated
into the existing, standard of care routine. This objective will be accomplished in three specific aims. In Aim 1,
we will develop and validate a rapid electrophysiology model to identify patient-specific CRT pacing protocols
that lead to improved LV synchrony based on pre-procedure measurements. In Aim 2, we will develop and
validate a rapid strain-driven growth model to predict patient-specific long-term (6 months) outcomes of CRT in
ischemic and non-ischemic LBBB patients. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that incorporating patient-specific
drug data through a multiscale model of cardiomyocyte hypertrophic signaling improves CRT remodeling
predictions.
 All model predictions will be validated against pre- intra- and post-CRT clinical data we collected from
100 patients treated in our center, including comprehensive MRI studies, ECGs, blood pressure, and blood tests.
Together, the proposed studies will enable researchers and clinicians to understand why CRT fails in many
patients, taking into account patient-specific electromechanics, scar, long-term remodeling, and drug regimen,
as well as explore patient-specific CRT strategies in order to improve the current 50-65% response rate."

Many congenital and acquired conditions resulting in the abnormality of the vagina often require reconstructive
surgery to achieve anatomical and physiological function. Unfortunately, reparative procedures are challenged
by the availability of vaginal tissues. Unfortunately, the use of non-native vaginal tissues and biomaterial
substitutes has contributed to various complications, including mechanical, structural, functional, or
biocompatibility problems. It is evident that native vaginal tissue, with its inherent functional properties, is most
suitable for surgical reconstruction. Recent advances in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have
provided a solution to create autologous tissues for various clinical applications, including skin, bone, cartilage,
urethra, and bladder. Applying the principles of tissue engineering, we have previously applied bioengineered
autologous neovaginal tissues to create a functionally normal vaginal vault in pediatric patients born with vaginal
aplasia. Due to the varying levels of pathologic conditions in each patient, manufacturing the target
bioengineered vaginal tissue construct for reconstruction is challenging, requiring a better solution to
meet the clinical needs. 3D bioprinting technology has emerged as a solution to develop patient-specific
personalized tissue constructs with precision and reproducibility, addressing the current translational limitation
of biomanufacturing for wide reconstructive applications. To address this unmet clinical need, our central
hypothesis is that developing a bioprinting workflow will permit the fabrication of personalized autologous vaginal
tissue constructs for clinical use. Thus, the objective of this study is to establish a clinically applicable 3D
bioprinting workflow to manufacture personalized autologous vaginal tissue constructs that consist of
patient-derived vaginal epithelial cells (EPCs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) for vaginal tissue
reconstruction. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three Specific Aims: 1) Develop and optimize
a bioprinting workflow to bioengineer a readily implantable vaginal tissue construct; 2) Validate the individualized
bioprinted vaginal tissue constructs using a preclinical animal model; 3) Establish a process development and
batch record for regulatory approval. Successful completion of the proposed work will provide a standardized 3D
bioprinting workflow that generates personalized vaginal tissue constructs with the required precision for vaginal
tissue reconstruction. Using personalized autologous bioengineered tissue constructs will significantly impact
patient care and change how we approach vaginal reconstruction in growing children and adults."

Kidney transplant is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), as
it extends survival, improves quality of life and is highly cost-effective. However, for about a third
of patients on the waitlist, pre-existing anti-HLA antibodies (i.e. allo-sensitization) presents a major
barrier to successful transplant. HLA antibody responses are maintained by memory B cells
(Bmem) and plasma cells (PC). Unfortunately, desensitization approaches have been largely
ineffective due to incomplete depletion of allo-specific B cells and PCs. WE HYPOTHESIZE that
stringent depletion of donor-specific B cells and PCs is required for a clinically significant reduction
of allo-antibodies necessary to achieve successful kidney transplantation. We have shown that
engineered T cell immunotherapies employing synthetic chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) can
induce durable remission of B cell lineage and plasma cell malignancies. Two CAR-T cell
therapies that target CD19 (CART-19) and B cell maturation antigen (CART-BCMA) result in
depletion of malignant cells but also physiologic B cells and PCs. Importantly, we have shown
that CART-BCMA and CART-19 can be safely administered together. Based on this experience,
our GOAL is to leverage this innovative platform to target Bmem and PCs and promote reduction
of preformed anti-HLA antibodies, thus providing a window of opportunity for transplantation.
Specifically, we propose a single-arm proof-of-concept CLINICAL TRIAL that combines CART-19
with CART-BCMA as a novel desensitization measure in kidney transplant candidates with a
cPRA ≥99.9%. MECHANISTIC studies will evaluate the cellular, humoral and molecular immune
correlates of CART-19 + CART-BCMA immunotherapy in highly sensitized kidney transplant
candidates. These are focused on the CAR T cells, T- and B-cell immunity (both allo-specific and
protective) and, in the event of successful transplantation, the allograft biology. An INFECTIOUS
DISEASE STUDY proposal will evaluate vaccine response and immune function in our renal
transplant candidates, including our study cohort. The multi-center team (Penn, NYU, MGH)
brings together investigators with extensive experience in CART therapy, desensitization, and

Preterm birth (<37 weeks of gestation) increases the risk infant death, hospitalization, developmental
disorders, and low educational attainment. Although non-Hispanic (NH) Black mothers show an increased
risk (vs. NH whites) of delivering preterm, NH Black infants historically show―at each gestational age
before term―improved health and survival relative to NH white infants. The main explanation for this
counterintuitive finding assumes greater selection against frail NH Black fetuses. According to the selection
argument, excess fetal loss among frail NH Black gestations results in a hardier cohort of survivors to birth
but who are delivered preterm.
Prior work describing this racial survival advantage has three important limitations. First, it continues to
infer the survival advantage from data now nearly two decades old. Second, it includes no test of the fetal
selection argument. Third, it fails to utilize a structural racism framework to understand the potential causes
of, and changes over time and place in, racial differences in fetal loss and infant survival. Rapid changes in
neonatal technology suggest that decades-old estimates of the survival advantage may have, since 2000,
diminished―or even transformed into a disparity. We will use the universe of live births, infant deaths, and
fetal deaths among NH Blacks and NH whites in the US (~65 million records, 1995 to 2018) to rigorously
examine race-specific trends in preterm birth and infant mortality rates. We will link these records
longitudinally by conception cohort to achieve several research objectives.
First, we will determine whether NH Blacks (vs. NH whites) born preterm show a survival advantage—or a
disparity—in infant mortality in the US. Second, we will investigate how the NH Black / NH white difference
in preterm birth rates and infant mortality rates has changed over time, in response to fluctuations in fetal
death rates and exogenous changes in neonatal technology (e.g., use of antenatal steroids). Third, we will
use a structural racism theoretical framework to examine the extent to which dynamic race-based spatial
indicators of inequality (e.g., segregation, incarceration rates) affect patterns across place and time in NH
Black (vs. NH white) fetal loss, selection in utero, and infant mortality among preterm births.
Our work is significant because we focus on the entire spectrum of perinatal outcomes, including the often
neglected but quite large racial disparity in fetal death. Results are expected to advance the knowledge base
on NICHD's high-priority research area to better understand racial/ethnic differences in infant health. Our
approach will also inform our understanding of the extent to which structural racism may have maintained―or
exacerbated―perinatal health disparities. Lastly, our place-based analysis will identify regions with
potentially large disparities in fetal loss and perinatal survival that may benefit from targeted healthcare and
non-healthcare resources."

Most human diseases involve interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Although the
environment is implicated in most chronic diseases, the etiology and mechanisms of action underlying
these diseases remain unclear. It is estimated that more than 80,000 chemicals are currently used in
commerce, challenging elucidation about chemical mechanisms-of-action and prioritization of
environmental health research. Integration of diverse data is required to understand environment-
disease associations, mechanisms of chemical action, toxicity prediction and development of effective
therapeutic interventions. In 2004, the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD;
http://ctdbase.org) was launched publicly to address an unmet need for a public data resource
dedicated exclusively to advancing understanding about environment-disease connections. Today,
through diversified funding approaches and in response to the evolving needs of the environmental
health research community, CTD provides a combination of richly annotated data describing chemical-
gene-phenotype-disease networks, exposure information, and novel analysis tools that enable user-
driven discoveries about environmental influences on human health. Currently, CTD provides >2.5
million manually curated relationships for 16,400 chemicals, 51,300 genes/proteins, 5,500 phenotypes,
and 7,200 diseases, contextualized with over 870 anatomical terms from approximately 600 species.
CTD curated data has been integrated into >145 other biomedical resources further extending the
reach of its impact. CTD has become a valued resource on which the environmental health research
community relies. We are requesting funding to: 1) continue advancing understanding about the
complex connections between environmental exposures and human health through ongoing manual
curation of chemicals, genes, phenotypes, diseases and exposure data from the scientific literature;
evaluation and integration of select external data sets; and baseline technical support; 2) enhance
curation efficiency through further development of our text-mining and online curation tools; and 3)
selectively restructure existing code, software, and database design (refactoring) to improve the
structure and performance of CTD. This proposed project will protect and extend NIH investments in
CTD and ensure the ongoing provision of this key resource for the environmental health research
community."

 Autophagy is an important cellular antiviral defense mechanism that potentially affects HIV infection and
transmission. The antiviral properties of autophagy are two-fold: (i) autophagy targets virions for lysosomal
degradation and (ii) this pathway aids in antigen presentation of virus pathogens. Despite its antiviral potential,
efforts to capitalize on autophagy against HIV have been limited due to a gap in our understanding of the role of
autophagy in HIV infection. Our long-term goal is to manipulate the antiviral properties of autophagy to facilitate
HIV clearance and improve treatments. Our overall objective is to identify the molecular interactions between
HIV and the autophagy machinery. Our central hypothesis is that autophagy restricts HIV, but the virus
overcomes this block using Nef, a notorious virulence factor that mediates immune evasion. This hypothesis has
been formulated based on our published and novel work demonstrating that autophagy depletes the HIV proteins
Gag, Vif and Vpr, but only when nef is defective 17. Gag is the driver of virion assembly; Vif counteracts the
damaging effects of the restriction factor APOBEC3G; and Vpr enhances infectivity by facilitating viral
transcription and arresting cell cycle at G2. Thus, a decrease in Gag, Vif and Vpr will impact virion production
and infectivity. However, we found that Nef blocks autophagy, restoring in turn HIV proteins and particle release.
Our studies showed that Nef sequesters the autophagosome initiator BECN1 at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
by facilitating its association with the autophagy inhibitor BCL2. Mechanistically, we uncovered that Nef induces
BCL2 mono-ubiquitination via the E3 ligase Parkin. This post-translational modification increases BCL2's
inhibitory effect over BECN1. Hence, this activity of Nef impairs autophagosome formation. The significance for
this research is that: (i) it will address an important knowledge gap concerning the interplay between HIV and
autophagy, and will reveal how this pathway influences HIV infection and transmission; and (ii) it will provide the
basis for the design of approaches aimed at enhancing autophagy to treat HIV infection and/or improve cure
strategies. We will attain the overall objective by pursuing the following three specific aims: (1) Identify HIV
molecules vulnerable to autophagy; (2) Dissect the mechanism by which Nef blocks autophagy; and (3) Elucidate
the impact of autophagy antagonism on HIV infectivity. The proposed research is innovative because it
represents a substantive departure from the status quo by revealing that HIV critically needs Nef to counteract
autophagy restriction."

In the US, African Americans (or Blacks), American Indians and Alaska Natives, Latinx, Native Hawaiians, and
other Pacific Islanders are underrepresented at all career stages in biomedical research. Factors contributing to
these disparities include decreased financial support, decreased peer and community support, and biased
promotion and grant funding review processes. Thus, the scientific community, including institutions and
professional societies, is called upon to respond to these disparities by recruiting, supporting, training, and
retraining underrepresented minorities (URMs). A diverse representation that reflects the US population leads to
more creative, innovative, and rigorous science. This proposal recognizes that the academic hurdles faced by
URM scientists/clinicians are related to the lack of access, training, and support as well as cultural biases within
institutions. The American Society of Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) is committed to addressing this goal
by offering the Excellence in Scientific Training and Professional Development (EXCEL) program, which will
deliver state-of-the-art research techniques and high-quality professional development to early-career
scientists/clinicians who identify as URM and who have research interests in fields related to the missions of the
ASBMR and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). In this R25 project,
a series of initiatives are proposed to attract talented early-career scientists from underrepresented backgrounds
with ASBMR- and NIDDK-relevant research interests and prepare them to serve as future leaders by offering
professional, scientific, and technical skill development and networking opportunities. The EXCEL cohorts will
undergo advanced education and instruction crucial for their success through the ASBMR Leadership Education
for Advancement (LEAD) Program. The ASBMR LEAD program will provide opportunities for the EXCEL cohort
to access leadership development training over the course of 10 months, culminating in a networking reception
at the annual ASBMR meeting. The training program will be led by professional leadership educators and senior
ASBMR members, and further supported by peer networking groups and discussions. In addition, early-career
scientists will be provided with grant funding to use for scientific or technical skill development activities, along
with 1:1 mentorship by a senior ASBMR member. Finally, we aim to improve the culture of ASBMR to be more
inclusive of URM by offering: 1) culturally aware mentorship training to society leadership and 2) offering all
ASBMR members to attend a workshop intended to eliminate bias in the peer-review process. Successful
completion of these Aims will provide critical access to networking opportunities, future scientific and professional
collaborations, and career development for URM biomedical researchers. Of equal importance, the success of
these Aims will create a shift in the cultural climate within the ASBMR, fostering inclusivity and creating and
sustaining a work environment supportive of all members."
10877020,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application describes an interdisciplinary program designed to study amyloid formation by human islet
amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP, also known as amylin), the causative agent of pancreatic islet amyloidosis-induced
beta-cell toxicity in diabetes. Amyloid formation by hIAPP is a well-established pathological factor contributing to
the development of type 2 diabetes, a debilitating disease that has reached epidemic proportions in the United
States. Islet amyloidosis is also a major contributor to islet cell transplantation failure. Aggregation of hIAPP has
recently been implicated in islet beta-cell deficiency in type 1 diabetes, and in the downstream cardiovascular
complications of diabetes. hIAPP is normally secreted as a soluble polypeptide hormone together with insulin from
the pancreatic beta-cells and plays an adaptive role in glucose metabolism, including the regulation of the action
of insulin and other pancreatic metabolic hormones. However, in metabolic disease, hIAPP aggregates into
cytotoxic conformations that assemble into amyloid fibrils that deposit as plaques in the islets. The process of
islet amyloid formation is toxic to beta-cells and plays an important role in disease progression. Wild type hIAPP
is responsible for islet amyloidosis in the majority of individuals, but an S20G mutation is linked to an increased
risk of diabetes. Soluble analogs of hIAPP are of interest as adjuncts to insulin therapy for the treatment of
diabetes, particularly for type 1 diabetes, where the rapid loss of beta-cells results in dependence on hormone
replacement therapy. Soluble hIAPP analogs are also of interest for the potential treatment of obesity. The
planned studies address fundamental issues in amyloid formation, and will offer important insight into strategies
for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We will apply an interdisciplinary combination of protein
biophysics, biochemistry, and islet cell biology to address three key issues in the field: 1) defining the
determinates of hIAPP amyloid formation and toxicity, including the role of specific amino acid sidechain
interactions; 2) elucidating the reasons for the aggressive aggregation and heightened toxicity of the S20G
mutant of hIAPP; and 3) the rational development and rigorous testing of next generation soluble analogs of
hIAPP. The studies will define the molecular features impacting hIAPP amyloid formation and islet beta-cell toxicity.
They will identify general principles that will be broadly applicable to other protein aggregation diseases, and to
mechanistic studies of amyloid formation."
10888422,"Project Summary:
Kindlin-2 (K2) is a peripheral membrane protein which regulates integrin, a key protein that mediates cellular
adhesion in humans. The goal of this project is to increase our structural understanding of K2 and the lipid
membranes to which it binds, to provide key insights into the regulatory function of K2. The interactions of K2
with cellular membranes are difficult to study because membranes are highly dynamic and lack long-range order.
As a result, our ability to study membranes and membrane proteins have been limited despite their potential to
be impactful in a wide array of systems. In this proposal we will focus on the signaling lipids phosphatidylinositol
phosphates (PIPs) which control the activity of K2. This lipid family is important for human health due to the role
of PIPs as regulators of numerous cell processes including nutrient sensing and growth. The misregulation of
PIP-dependent pathways is implicated in numerous rare and common diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
Mechanistic details of PIP activation and regulation of protein binding partners, like K2, are essential to
understanding and combating these diseases. Solid-state NMR is a unique tool for the atomic resolution
characterization of the structure and dynamics of lipids and determining the factors that govern lipid-protein
interactions. Over the five-year timeline of this proposal I plan to develop NMR experiments for directly
investigating K2-lipid interfaces with high sensitivity and specificity. The focus of this study will be the conserved
PIP binding domains of K2: a ubiquitin-like F0 domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The presence of
naturally NMR-active and chemically distinct phosphate groups in the PIPs will serve as a handle to directly
probe the binding domain-lipid interface. Characterization of specific interactions between lipid head groups and
proteins will be the foundation upon which we examine the structural basis of PIP recognition and the mechanism
of K2 activation by PIPs. Beyond studies of the protein-lipid interface, we seek to understand how membrane
binding affects the interactions of K2 with partner proteins and itself. Our experiments will take advantage of all
the latest improvements in NMR hardware, particularly very-fast magic angle spinning. My group and I are highly
experienced in developing novel experiments to assign the chemical shifts and solve structures of protein
complexes, membrane proteins, and protein fibrils. This provides us with the tools that are required to tackle the
structural aspects of lipid-protein and protein-protein interfaces. We will use an integrative approach in which
state-of-the-art computational techniques will guide our experimental work. All-atom molecular dynamics will be
used to provide hypotheses that may be tested with NMR and to provide atomic resolution interpretations of
experimental data. This work is vital for assisting in the design of therapeutics and diagnostics that target K2 and
other PIP binding systems. The results of this project will improve our ability to describe K2-PIP interactions,
understand the effects of disease-causing mutations on the regulation of integrins, and propose solutions to
some of the largest challenges in human health."

 This Career Development Award will support Dr. Marvin Langston in his transition to independence as
a translational researcher. His long-term research goals include understanding the etiology and outcomes of
urologic conditions with an emphasis on prostate diseases (prostate cancer, prostatitis, and lower urinary tract
symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH/LUTS)); developing and validating clinical tools to
improve and personalize treatment options; and implementing these tools in “real world” clinical settings.
 BPH/LUTS is an extremely common set of conditions among older men and can be considered a
progressive disease, mainly characterized by deteriorating LUTS over time which causes considerable bother
and decreased quality of life, urinary retention, and death in rare cases. Conventional pharmacological
treatment strategies fail in preventing long-term clinical outcomes in about 30% of treated patients. Despite a
high volume of pharmacological research, there have been very limited advances in therapy for BPH/LUTS in
recent years. Therefore, innovative and well-designed studies are needed to understand the long-term
comparative effectiveness of contemporary BPH/LUTS pharmacological therapies while leveraging the clinical
covariates that can be captured in “big data” sources such as the electronic health record.
 To address these limitations, In Aim 1, Dr. Langston will evaluate the long-term comparative
effectiveness of BPH/LUTS pharmacological therapies in an observational study drawn from the Kaiser
Permanente membership population, a fully integrated healthcare network. If well designed studies
demonstrate that contemporary pharmacological approaches are not more effective at preventing long-term
BPH/LUTS progression than conventional approaches alone, then personalized treatment options may
ultimately provide the best strategy for reducing long-term BPH/LUTS progression. Therefore, in Aim 2 Dr.
Langston will develop and validate predictive models using demographic, clinical, and laboratory data available
at the time of BPH/LUTS diagnosis to identify patients at increased risk of long-term BPH/LUTS clinical
outcomes (acute urinary retention and BPH surgery) using machine learning based predictive analytics.
 As the volume, availability, and access to electronic data increases, so does the need for scientists with
the content and methodologic expertise to correctly use and translate these data into improved urology care.
This K01 provides the training for Dr. Langston to meet this challenge as a translational researcher and
compete successfully for future R01 funding."
10934587,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The epigenetic status of genomes including nucleosome occupancy, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation,
is highly relevant to the regulation of DNA-template biological processes from transcription to DNA replication and
repair. Most existing techniques for characterizing epigenome utilize Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
following the biochemical reactions that capture the signals (e.g., bisulfite conversion, cross-linking and
chromatin immunoprecipitation/ChIP). The development of these techniques has dramatically accelerated the
research of different epigenetics events and has led to many important biological findings. As the new
technique nanopore sequencing has been optimized to convey robust sequencing data of single DNA
molecules with long read length, it brings in new discernible information that is useful for addressing certain
challenging but important epigenetics problems. We develop an experimental protocol MeSMLR-seq and a
series of bioinformatics methods to define the multiple types of epigenetic events, including nucleosome
occupancy, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation, at the rarely explored genome regions and biological
context by leveraging the unique information of nanopore sequencing. Utilizing these experimental and
bioinformatics methods, we aim to interrogate the following problems during the epigenetic reprogramming of
early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development: in Aim 1, we will study the epigenetic
regulation of transposable element expression and transposition. Aim 2 will construct the allele-specific
epigenome and identify the genome loci with significant epigenome difference between alleles. Aim 3 will
identify significant difference of the epigenomes between DNA strands and investigate their regulatory roles
and dynamics during epigenetic reprogramming. These studies are anticipated to provide the first experimental
and bioinformatics platform for improve our understanding of epigenome with complex biomedical context in a
comprehensive manner."

Although combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) effectively suppresses human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) replication, it does not cure HIV infection and requires costly lifelong treatment. A major challenge for
curing HIV infection is the long-lived latent HIV reservoir, which evades immune recognition and is responsible
for viral rebound shortly after interruption of cART. Substantial research efforts have focused on eliminating
latently infected cells through so-called “shock and kill” strategy, which reactivates latent HIV using latency-
reversing agents (LRAs) to allow for the “kill” by cytolysis or immune-mediated clearance. Particularly, eradication
of theHIV reservoir by anti-HIV T cells, which maintain antiviral immunity in patients as a “living” drug, presents
a promising strategy to either fully resolve the infection or maintain long-term control without cART treatment.
However, clearance of the HIV reservoir by T-cell based immunotherapy remains challenging because of 1) T-
cell exhaustion, 2) the need of lifelong anti-HIV immunity to replace cART, 3) sanctuary sites like B cell follicles
that exclude most HIV-specific CD8 T cells, and 4) unclear impact of LRAs, most of which target epigenetic
pathways, on the function and differentiation of antiviral CD8 T cells in vivo. We and others have recently
characterized a stem-like CD8 T cell subset in chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), simian
immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and HIV infections, as well as in mouse and human tumors. Compared to
terminally exhausted CD8 T cells, stem-like CD8 T cells are less exhausted, mediate long-term immunity, and
respond more potently after treatment of immunotherapies in animals and human. In chronic LCMV, SIV, and
HIV infections, these cells express CXCR5, migrate to B cell follicles and kill infected T follicular helper cells, a
major latent reservoir of HIV and SIV. In addition, frequency of these cells inversely correlates with viremia of
SIV or HIV. Most recently, we showed that the single-cell transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles of stem-like CD8
T cells are distinct from other CD8 subsets generated after acute or chronic LCMV infection. In addition, we
identified a transcriptional program involving transcription factor TOX that is essential for stem-like CD8 T cell
differentiation and the long-term persistence of antiviral CD8 T cells during chronic viral infection. Here, I will
determine the transcriptional and epigenetic programs of stem-like CD8 T cells required for optimal T-cell based
immunotherapy against HIV. I will use animal models of chronic LCMV and SIV infections as well as samples
from HIV patients, and employ cutting-edge technologies, including single-cell profiling of T-cell transcriptomes
and epigenomes, CRISPR/Cas9 screening, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, to determine
how “shock” by epigenetic modifying LRAs affects the program and antiviral immunity of stem-like CD8 T cells
and whether transcriptional and epigenetic programs of stem-like CD8 T cells can be adopted to enhance the
“kill” of the HIV reservoir by T-cell based immunotherapies. The results from this study will build the foundation
for novel immunotherapies that achieve long-term remission from HIV infection without a need for cART."

Over half of adult Americans use dietary supplements. However, little is known about their safety
and effectiveness as these products are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and post-marketing surveillance is limited to adverse events. The NIH Office of Dietary
Supplements (ODS) seeks to fill in that gap and has identified electronic health record (EHR) data
as a potential tool to advance that goal. Preliminary data from our pilot study sponsored by the
NIH ODS that used advanced machine/deep learning techniques suggest that magnesium
supplements may lower the risk of heart failure (HF) in patient with diabetes mellitus (DM) and
may improve outcomes in those with HF. Both HF and DM affect the health and outcomes of
millions of Americans. DM is a risk factor for HF and adversely affects outcomes in those with HF.
Magnesium is an integral part of over 300 human enzyme systems, which are impaired in
magnesium deficiency. Findings from our study suggest that a low dietary magnesium intake is
associated with a higher risk of incident HF, especially among those with DM. However, less is
known about this relationship in patients with HF. The Specific Aims 1 and 2 of the proposed
projects are to test the hypotheses that a new prescription for oral magnesium supplement is
associated with a lower risk of incident HF in those with DM and of mortality and hospitalization
in patients with HF. Although magnesium is inexpensive and relatively safe, its long-term effects
may vary for individual patients. Thus, instead of recommending it to millions of patients, it would
be ideal to recommend to individuals who are most likely to benefit. Thus, our Specific Aim 3 is to
develop and validate a novel explainable deep learning-based risk prediction model to determine
with precision the optimal clinical setting under which an individual may derive clinical benefits
from magnesium supplementation given their individual characteristics including multimorbidity
and polypharmacy. These aims will be achieved by interrogating the Veterans Affairs (VA)
national EHR data that includes over 2 million Veterans with DM and 1 million with HF with ~20
years of longitudinal data on magnesium supplements, serum magnesium, and outcomes. We
will use a new-user design, marginal structural model (propensity score weighting) with machine-
learning-based estimation and stability analyses to minimize confounding and account for
potential biases. The prediction model for individual risk/benefit will be validated using the Cerner
Health Facts® data for generalizability in non-Veteran populations. The findings of proposed study
will generate new evidence that will have direct clinical implications and those of Aim 3 specifically
will provide a novel precision medicine tool to individualize magnesium supplement use."

The Essentia Health Community Cancer Research Program (EHCCRP) was originally funded by the National
Cancer Institute in 1984 under the former name Duluth CCOP. EHCCRP brings the benefits of clinical
research to patients in regions that would be without access to clinical trials due to the distance from the
nearest comprehensive cancer center. With successful competitive CCOP grant renewals in 1987, 1990, 1995,
2000, 2005 and 2010, as well as a successful NCORP grant in 2014, EHCCRP has proven to be a sustainable
and successful community oncology research program over the span of 34 years. Since the NCORP grant
inception in 2014, the EHCCRP has continued its expansion in rural communities by adding additional affiliates
and sub-affiliates. The EHCCRP catchment area now covers portions of five states (MN, WI, MI, ND, SD).
This large geographic area is predominantly rural and includes a number of American Indian tribal
communities. The strategy of the EHCCRP NCORP is to continue to offer patients in the region access to
state-of-the-art cancer care through participation in NCI supported treatment, cancer control/prevention,
screening, post treatment-surveillance, and imaging protocols. The NCORP grant will support the infrastructure
and personnel necessary to fulfill our proposed research strategy in our catchment area. In addition, the
EHCCRP NCORP will continue to develop a robust Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) program; to
participate in NCI supported CCDR protocols. The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology will function as the
primary research base for the EHCCRP and secondary research bases will include the NRG, ECOG-ACRIN,
SWOG, and Wake Forest. The EHCCRP NCORP will continue to open trials through the Clinical Trials Support
Unit of the NCI with full utilization of the central IRB. The goal of the EHCCRP is to accrue 350 patients
annually to treatment, cancer control, prevention, screening, imaging and post-treatment surveillance
protocols. EHCCRP CCDR infrastructure will grow over the coming NCORP grant period to support 6 open
CCDR protocols annually. A robust culture of cancer care that supports multi-disciplinary treatments allows us
to deliver the best possible therapy while maintaining a high level of accrual to clinical trials.

Project 1 of the Center on Causal Data Science for Child and Adolescent Maltreatment Prevention
(CHAMP Center) will involve determining predictive and causal models for many categories of
maltreatment exposures and their consequential outcomes, and developing a scalable set of decision
support tools (DSTs) from these models. These DSTs will be designed to guide decisions by
practitioners in a position to prevent maltreatment and mitigate the severity of maltreatment-related
outcomes. Given that intervention on targets that are non-causal/non-etiological factors cannot
improve health or adaptive functioning, such decisions require that that the practitioner can
confidently: 1) identify etiological factors that cause health or functional impairments, and 2) target the
external or internal etiological factors relevant for these impairments for a particular child and family.
This becomes especially challenging when etiologies are complex and interventions must be
customized to precisely target diverse sets of causes, as is often true for children and families who
meet criteria for maltreatment-related interventions. The goal of Project 1 is to determine models and
to develop a set of DSTs to guide such decisions. We will do this by applying advanced causal data
science methods to several large, relevant data sets to derive valid causal models for several
categories of maltreatment exposure (sexual abuse, physical abuse, neglect) and maltreatment-
related outcomes (post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, self-harm, aggression, substance
abuse, obesity, functional impairment). We will integrate these analyses with machine learning
predictive classification to identify which predictive models can accurately classify children into risk
categories. We will work closely with members of the Resource Core to develop the models and of
the Dissemination & Outreach Core to engage the full spectrum of relevant stakeholders (domain
experts, primary care pediatricians, child welfare workers, behavioral health clinicians, agency
administrators, children, and family members) to ensure that the tools Project 1 develops are
effective, practical, trustworthy, and safe. One of the DSTs that Project 1 develops will form the basis
for Project 2, which will test this tool in a field trial. Insights from Project 2 will be essential for Project
1 to iteratively improve on the DSTs it develops."

The International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) is an international non-profit organisation the
purpose of which is to promote public health through international harmonisation of
technical requirements that contributes to the timely introduction of new medicines and
continued availability of the approved medicines to patients, to the prevention of
unnecessary duplication of clinical trials in humans, to the development, registration and
manufacturing of safe, effective, and high quality medicines in an efficient and cost-
effective manner, and to the minimisation of the use of animal testing without
compromising safety and effectiveness.
A major output of ICH’s work is the development of harmonised technical guidelines on
Quality, Safety and Efficacy topics. The ICH Guidelines represent agreed-upon scientific
guidance for meeting technical requirements for registration of pharmaceutical products.
Each ICH Regulatory Member is expected to implement ICH Guidelines in line with ICH
Procedures according to its national/regional requirements, with the stage of
implementation of all ICH Guidelines also being dependent on when a Member joined
ICH. Monitoring the progress of international harmonisation and coordinating efforts in
this regard is an important ICH focus. As part of its effort to achieve global harmonised
implementation of ICH Guidelines, ICH is also working on ensuring that high quality
training is available based upon scientific and regulatory principles outlined in the ICH
Guidelines. The ICH Secretariat provides administrative and project management
support for these activities.
To-date 65 harmonised ICH Guidelines on Safety, Quality and Efficacy topics, as well
as Multidisciplinary topics have been developed."

Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Despite extensive
research and medical efforts, we lack both the means to identify it early and the therapeutic options to prevent it
when identified. The vaginal microbiome is believed to have a causal role in a substantial fraction of sPTBs, and
multiple studies have shown that even when measured early in pregnancy, the microbiome is associated with
adverse pregnancy outcomes. Despite this great promise, robust microbiome-based predictors for sPTB have
not been developed yet, and we lack a detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying its involvement in
sPTB. We attribute this to a small sample size in current studies; the aggregative definition of sPTB as a binary
variable, ignoring its heterogeneous presentations and etiologies; and a focus on microbial taxonomy instead of
data that is more functionally and mechanistically oriented. We propose to capitalize on one of the largest and
best-phenotyped pregnancy cohorts collected to date, the nuMoM2b study. This was a national, multi-center trial
that collected vaginal swabs at three time-points from women with diverse geographic and demographic
backgrounds. This study profiled nearly 500 women with sPTB, almost an order of magnitude more than any
previous microbiome study. We have compiled an interdisciplinary team with intimate knowledge of the
nuMoM2b study, ample experience in compiling, profiling, and analyzing large-scale microbiome and
metabolomic cohorts, and a track record of innovation in microbiome analysis and its clinical applications. We
will perform deep metagenomic sequencing, longitudinal sample sequencing, and matched metabolomic
analysis of a total of almost 6,000 samples from nearly 1,500 pregnant women, generating the largest such
dataset to date. This dataset would advance the microbiome community, drive discovery in the field, and enable
us and other researchers to study host-microbiome interactions, in general and specifically in the context of
sPTB, with an unprecedented depth. Our proposed data analysis offers a nuanced and high-resolution view of
both clinical and biological data. We will study sPTB while accounting for its various clinical presentations,
etiologies, and important maternal covariates. We will study the vaginal ecosystem from multiple angles,
investigating microbial genomic adaptations, levels of metabolites in the ecosystem, and dynamic changes to
the microbiome profile. We will devise an aggregative computational framework, based on state-of-the-art
methods and algorithms, that provides early prediction of sPTB based on microbiome-related features. We will
employ a combination of parametric and non-parametric methods to obtain mechanistic insights into host-
microbiome interactions that potentially contribute to sPTB and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Altogether,
this study will be transformative to our understanding of the vaginal microbiome in adverse pregnancy outcomes
and of host-microbiome interactions in general."

 The accurate clinical diagnosis of Lewy body diseases (LBD: Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy

biomarkers including real time quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC) offer the ability to diagnose patients with
greater accuracy during life by identifying pathologic α-synuclein (a-syn) or tau seeds. However, in LBD,
approximately 50% of cases will harbor significant AD pathology, and in AD up to 50% harbor limbic a-syn which
can complicate interpretation of biomarker signatures. Therefore, comprehensive pathological validation studies
are essential to understand the utility of these new assays and their association with histopathologic burden and
clinical correlations. If RT-QuIC metrics relate to pathological burden or cognitive outcomes, they could be used
as an objective biomarker in LBD, an ongoing critical need. The aims of this proposal are to test whether a-syn
and tau RT-QuIC is associated with 1) histopathological features and 2) cognitive outcomes in LBD and AD. The
hypotheses are that a-syn and tau RT-QuIC will be able to predict primary and co-pathologies in LBD and AD
and that higher degrees of RT-QuIC activity will associate with greater neuropathological burden and worse
cognitive outcomes. The proposed experiments will leverage pre-existing autopsy cohorts with antemortem CSF
and cognitive testing collected at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and the University of
Pennsylvania with the RT-QuIC expertise of the NIH/NIAID Rocky Mountain Laboratories.
 The K23 candidate is an Assistant Professor of Neurosciences at the UCSD, having previously completed

10865134,"The overall goal of this application is to understand the mechanisms by which prions cause damage to
synapses, and establish and maintain a self-propagating infection in the CNS. We also wish to develop
pharmacologic therapies for these disorders based on our knowledge of the molecular and cellular
mechanisms underlying the disease process. Although the molecular templating model for prion propagation,
in which PrPC is converted into infectious PrPSc, is now widely accepted, the mechanisms by which prions
actually cause neurodegeneration have remained mysterious. There is now considerable evidence that cell-
surface PrPC mediates many of the neurotoxic effects of PrPSc, likely by serving as a receptor that binds PrPSc
during the first step of the prion conversion process. However, how this initiates downstream toxic signals in
the cytoplasm, and how these signals alter synaptic structure or function were largely unknown.
 The work we have accomplished during the previous grant cycle has provided key insights into this issue
by defining a PrPC/NMDAR/p38 MAPK signaling pathway that mediates the earliest effects of PrPSc
synaptotoxicity. Based on a combination of structural analysis and functional assays, we have proposed a
model in which the N-terminal domain of PrPC serves as a toxic effector that is regulated by specific docking
interactions with the C-terminal domain. Artificial disruption of this intramolecular interaction results in a variety
of toxic activities in cellular and transgenic models.
 In this renewal application, we propose, first, to elucidate how prion synaptotoxic signaling is initiated at
the cell surface. Second, we plan to dissect the intracellular signaling cascades that are activated by prions,
and how they result in synaptic dysfunction. Third, we will investigate the mechanisms by which cells establish
and maintain prion infection. We anticipate that the studies proposed here will provide powerful insights into
biological mechanisms that are common to multiple neurodegenerative disorders caused by toxic protein
aggregates in the brain, and will lead to the discovery of shared therapeutic approaches that can be used to
treat them."
10914224,"Project 3 - Project Summary:
 Liver is arguably the most permissive tissue for recombinant adeno-associated virus
(rAAV)-mediated in vivo gene delivery, and liver transduction can be achieved by a simple
systemic rAAV administration. However, liver-directed rAAV gene therapy for alpha-1-antitrypsin
(AAT) deficiency (AATD) has met multiple challenges, demanding more efficient gene delivery
and expression especially in the presence of pre-existing anti-AAV immunity. To address these
challenges, one potential solution is to develop new AAV capsids that allow for more efficient
gene delivery and/or transgene expression in the liver. We have recently employed single-
molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing to discover novel full-length cap sequences from
natural AAV proviral libraries from the human population to identify novel AAV variants with
desirable tissue tropisms and vector properties. In this project, we will employ a high-throughput
Illumina barcode sequencing approach to analyze a large collection of new AAV capsids
identified from NHP and human tissues. The new capsid variants identified from this project
collectively represent a valuable toolbox for liver-directed rAAV gene delivery to multiple species
with favorable immunological profiles, and therefore are expected to have broad utilization in
gene therapy applications. This project contains four specific aims designed to develop liver-
tropic AAV capsids from our primate-derived library to support preclinical AATD gene therapy
studies and clinical translation: Aim 1, To screen for mouse liver-targeting AAV capsid variants
in wild-type (WT) mice; Aim 2, To screen for ferret liver-targeting AAV capsid variants in WT
ferrets; Aim 3, To screen for human liver-targeting, NAB-escaping AAV capsid variants in
humanized mice; and Aim 4, Structural-functional studies of new capsid variants. There is
considerable interactivity between this project and the other three projects."

The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Cancer Center is marked by creative and energetic faculty,
innovative and collaborative research, and an emphasis on developing technologies that are used broadly in
cancer research labs around the world. Cancer Center Developmental Funds have provided critical seed funding
to strategically recruit six new faculty, stimulated collaboration and interdisciplinary science through twelve pilot
projects, and spurred innovation through the Shared Resources in eight technology-development projects. With
the support of the Executive Committee and Senior Leadership, the Cancer Center Director utilized these funds
to implement the Center’s strategic initiatives. When paired with substantial Institutional support and
philanthropic funding, these Developmental Funds resulted in significant returns on investment, including 48
published papers and preprints and nine additional papers in preparation or under review. In addition, funding
for new investigators led to data that supported the successful application for more than $5.7 million in peer-
reviewed external funding and a total of 25 successfully funded external grants over the last five years. As a
whole, Developmental Funds are an extremely valuable source of support that enables the CSHL Cancer Center
to make fundamental discoveries about the biological mechanisms underlying cancer and to develop unique
approaches towards the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer."
10904851,"ORGANOID SHARED RESOURCE – ABSTRACT
The Organoid Shared Resource was established to provide Cancer Center members with access to the
reagents, equipment, and expertise needed to culture and perform experiments with three-dimensional organoid
models. The organoid technology was introduced to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cancer Center in 2012
by David Tuveson, with the rationale that these three dimensional cultures recapitulate numerous aspects of
primary tumor biology more faithfully than standard two-dimensional cell lines. There are now 18 Cancer Center
member labs (47% of members) using human and murine organoids in their research, and organoids have been
used in 40 Cancer Center publications or preprints. To support the growing use of organoids, the new Shared
Resource was launched in 2020 with dedicated lab space and staff. The Organoid Shared Resource is being
proposed in this application as a new Cancer Center Shared Resource, led by Faculty Head Camila dos Santos,
Ph.D., and manager Dennis Plenker, Ph.D. The Shared Resource offers members centralized access to
protocols for generating and working with organoid cultures, training in methods, and standardized culture
reagents, as well as equipment for performing high-throughput chemical screens on either two dimensional cell
lines or organoid cultures. Cancer Center members will benefit from access to a biorepository of human organoid
models that have been validated and well characterized. The Shared Resource will be able to offer Cancer
Center members substantial cost-savings due to bulk purchasing of culture reagents, and the development of
protocols to produce media additives in-house. The use of organoids has already fostered several collaborative
Cancer Center projects in line with Cancer Center strategic priorities, including investigating cancer health
disparities in diverse populations, integrating quantitative and wet-bench biologists, and expanding translational
research."
10847478,"CORE B ABSTRACT - Clinical Ascertainment, Retention and Biospecimen Acquisition Research Core
 The purpose of this core is to develop and support the two human birth cohorts which serve as the
study populations to address fundamental questions about the role of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) on
childhood respiratory morbidity and asthma through scientific projects that focus on interactive pathways of the
host and virus on asthma development (Project 1), and interventions that may modify immune and airway
epithelial cell development through which RSV may cause asthma (Project 2). This clinical ascertainment,
retention and biosample acquisition and management research core will serve to manage the two human study
populations: Infant Susceptibility to Pulmonary Infections and Asthma Following RSV Exposure (INSPIRE) and
Childhood Allergy and the Neonatal Environment (CANOE), and manage the resultant key biospecimens and
data. Data acquisition will include careful phenotyping, RSV exposure assessment, physiologic testing, nasal
airway epithelial cell (NAEC) collection, nasal brushings, blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs), and DNA for Projects 1 and 2.
 This core is centered around the rich infrastructure at Vanderbilt and surrounding engaged pediatric
and obstetrical clinics to conduct the clinical studies. This includes support for the recruitment, enrollment and
retention of the birth cohorts, longitudinal follow-up, and the laboratory components of the biosample collection
and processing. This core assembles a complementary research team of epidemiologists, virologists,
immunologists, geneticists, biostatisticians, and research personnel experienced in cohort retention, and
biospecimen acquisition and will provide the data and biospecimens to analytic Core C where data will be
processed and biostatistical analyses will be conducted. This core is structured as two aims with each
supporting one of the two cohorts. The first is to facilitate and oversee the longitudinal follow-up of the
established INSPIRE birth cohort, biospecimen collection, including NAECs for Projects 1 and 2. The second is
to facilitate and oversee recruitment, enrollment and longitudinal follow-up of the new CANOE birth cohort, and
biospecimen collection, including NAECs for Projects 1 and 2."

The Enrichment Program provides an organizational framework in which an eclectic set of activities works
together to bring added value to a training experience so that the whole is truly greater than the sum of its
parts. The set of activities that constitutes this CCEH Enrichment Program includes 1) expert outside speakers
who not only give a lecture to the larger Hutch community, but also spend an evening with “Fellows only” to
discuss career paths, 2) training opportunities made available by technical experts who staff our cores, 3)
scheduled short presentations of lab-based faculty who are amenable to taking a fellow, and 4) travel support
to obtain specific training at another CCEH site. Added to these is the retention of the internal Pilot & Feasibility
(P&F) program which was at one point a separate program in the CCEH but is now replaced by the External
P&F which will be administered by the soon to be formed coordinating center. Since our P&F grants program
proved valuable to our trainees, we will retain it as part of our enrichment program and fund it from our
Program income account. Finally, we offer to our trainees the opportunity to teach, be a role model and change
the life of an underserved, underrepresented student intern. It is a gratifying experience, made valuable by the
fact that these students lives really do change. Over the last year 25+ student alumni from our summer high

10847480,"CORE C ABSTRACT - Data Management and Analysis Research Core
 The purpose of this core is to manage and support the resources to address fundamental questions
about the role of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) on childhood respiratory morbidity and asthma. This data
management and analysis core will serve to manage the data from the two human study populations for
Project 1 and 2: Infant Susceptibility to Pulmonary Infections and Asthma Following RSV Exposure (INSPIRE)
and Childhood Allergy and the Neonatal Environment (CANOE), the experimental data, and the proposed
animal studies in Project 2. It will also serve to oversee the analyses for this proposal. The combination of data
management and analysis centered within one core allows for the oversight of the complex human, biosample
and experimental data to be used in this proposal, and the integrated collaboration of the biostatistical team in
the proposed analyses, and thus builds synergy for the projects 1 and 2 that this core serves. The research
team has a successful track record of working with the types of complex data generated in these projects and
conducting the proposed biostatistical analyses. This core assembles a complementary research team of
biostatisticians, geneticists, systems biologists, bioinformatics and database management staff along with the
data management and state of the art analytical skills necessary to successfully conduct the proposed studies.
 The two major functions of this core, data management and data analysis are outlined in two
separate aims or functions of this core: 1) Management and integration of clinical, physiological,
immunologic, microbiome, airway epithelial cell, genetic and epigenetic data from collaborating sites with
a central infrastructure that facilitates the proposed research. This includes ensuring subject-level data
quality control of primary clinical data collection, the pre-analytical variables and biospecimen processing
and performance of assays with validated standard protocols that minimize errors in reproducibility, and
efficient organization of samples and data among all research centers. 2) Integration of analytic support
for the conduct of the proposed rigorous biostatistical analyses that address research questions across
projects 1 and 2. This includes ensuring integration of the biostatistical team with the scientific cores,
creating derived and imputed variables, developing shared analytic datasets for specific projects to be
disseminated to the biostatistical leads on each aim, and conducting and implementing the proposed
rigorous statistical methodology. This is a natural extension of the work of our experienced biostatistical

10847482,"PROJECT 1 ABSTRACT - RSV and asthma: Defining the influence of host and exposure variation on disease
development
 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) is strongly and consistently
associated with asthma. While this has been repeatedly demonstrated for decades, rather limited progress has
been made on further understanding the causal association between RSV LRI and wheezing illnesses over the
more than 50 years since the observation was first published. In our prior funding cycle we have demonstrated
the relationship between a severe infection with RSV and asthma is confounded by a shared genetic
predisposition to both conditions. We have also demonstrated that infant RSV infection, not only severe
infection, is associated with increased asthma risk, and that missing RSV infection during infancy significantly
protects from asthma development. To understand pathways through which RSV contributes to asthma
development we have demonstrated that infant RSV infection alters the developing nasal microbiome and type
1 anti-viral responses, and we have identified specific RSV strains associated with increased asthma risk. This
U19 renewal expands upon this series of significant findings to answer key questions to assess causality and
inform targetable asthma prevention. Our overarching hypothesis is that age-dependent effects of infant RSV
infection contribute to chronic respiratory disease through altering airway epithelial DNA methylation (DNAm),
and airway epithelial metabolism and developmental programming. Further, we hypothesize that identifying
gene x RSV interactions will explain individual variability in asthma susceptibility following infant RSV infection.
 To test these hypotheses we will use a combination of human natural quasi-randomization studies of
infant RSV infection specifically designed to assess the impact of infant RSV infection on subsequent
respiratory health and the airway epithelium, and in vitro models of RSV infection of nasal airway epithelial
cells (NAECs). The overarching objectives of the 3 aims that will test these hypotheses are: 1) to determine
whether the age of first infant RSV infection is associated with risk of subsequent incident recurrent wheeze
and asthma; 2) to delineate the longitudinal effects of RSV on airway epithelial cell differentiation and
metabolism throughout infancy and childhood; 3) to evaluate host gene ´ infant RSV infection interactions and
RSV-dependent NAEC DNAm longitudinally to identify changes and temporal stability of RSV-dependent
DNAm marks and their association with recurrent wheeze and asthma.
 This proposal has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of the mechanisms and
developmental processes underlying the effect of RSV on recurrent wheeze and asthma, and to identify novel
targetable pathways for prevention of acute RSV morbidity, childhood recurrent wheeze and asthma."
10847485,"In the last funding cycle of this AADCRC, Project 1 (Dr. Hartert – Leader) found that increased blood levels of
L-citrulline (L-CIT) were significantly associated with decreased odds of infant bronchiolitis (odds ratio (OR)
0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48-0.95). These data suggest that higher blood levels of L-CIT at time of
birth protected against infant bronchiolitis and may prevent development of asthma later in childhood. We
therefore hypothesize that compared to regular diet (RD), an L-CIT supplemented diet (L-CITsd) fed to
parents during gestation and their offspring prevents severe RSV bronchiolitis in the offspring. Our
preliminary data reveal that the L-CITsd decreased RSV-induced lung IL-13 expression, reduced the frequency
of lung IL-13 expression by ILC2, and restrained airways responsiveness. Further, L-CITsd significantly
decreased ILC2 expression of IL-13 when the cells were stimulated ex vivo with IL-33, and L-CIT added to
ILC2 culture inhibited IL-33-induced IL-13 production. Elevated levels of ILC2, IL-33, and IL-13 are associated
with severe RSV infection in infancy. These finding are important because males have a greater risk of severe
RSV-induced disease; therefore, L-CITsd provides a possible benefit to the sex most likely to have severe
RSV bronchiolitis. Importantly, these protective effects of L-CITsd did not come at a cost of worsening
adversely affecting lung anti-viral immunity to RSV. L-CIT is currently not present in prenatal vitamins and the
major sources of citrulline (watermelon) is not commonly introduced into the diets of infants until after six
months of life, a time after which children are at greatest risk for RSV bronchiolitis. Aim 1 is to determine the
mechanism by which L-citrulline dietary supplementation inhibits RSV-induced type 2 immunopathology. In
this aim, we will determine: a) the effect of L-CITsd on IL-33-driven ILC2 cytokine production and
immunopathology, b) the protective effect of L-CITsd on ILC2 epigenetic regulation, c) the durability of the
protection of L-CITsd during the first infection to subsequent infection, and d) the ability of L-CITsd to inhibit
human lung ILC2 function and proliferation. Aim 2 is to define the effect of L-CIT on airway epithelial function
in response to RSV infection. In this aim, we will determine: a) the ability of L-CITsd to inhibit RSV-induced
ROS generation in mice, and b) the effect of L-CIT on ROS generation, cytokine/chemokine production, and
membrane barrier function by primary nasal airway epithelial cells obtained from the INSPIRE cohort.
Project 2 is also highly innovative because it will be the first to: 1) determine the role of L-CITsd in decreasing
RSV-induced immunopathology, 2) define the effect of L-CITsd on ILC2 epigenetic regulation, 3) determine
how L-CITsd regulates epithelial cell function in vivo in the setting of respiratory viral infection, and 4) use
primary airway epithelial cells from infants to determine the effect of L-CIT on RSV-induced cytokine gene
expression."
10825629,"SUMMARY
Fertilization of aneuploid gametes often leads to pregnancy loss or disorders such as Down’s syndrome.
Aneuploidy occurs in 10-30% of human gametes and typically arises from chromosome segregation errors during
meiosis. Meiotic events such as homologous chromosome pairing, double strand breaks (DSBs), recombination
and the formation of crossovers, ensure proper chromosome segregation. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that
regulate these events are incompletely understood. Consequently, there are currently few to no strategies to
predict or prevent aneuploidy during gametogenesis. To overcome some limitations in the field, we established
a fluorescence reporter-operator system (FROS) based on the lac operator-lac repressor (lacO-lacR) paradigm,
which enables protein targeting to distinct genomic regions. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the mechanisms
that regulate chromosome segregation during meiosis and thus ensure the formation of gametes with a normal
karyotype. Aim 1 use FROS to dissect rapid chromosome motions in mouse spermatocytes at prophase I. We
will also combine FROS with long-term 3D measurements of chromosome motions in seminiferous tubules to
directly test whether homologous chromosome pairing arises from increasingly productive interactions (reeling
in), versus reiterative rounds of transient interactions (catch and release). Additionally, we will analyze mutant
spermatocytes by FROS to determine how key players, including components of the Linker of Nucleoskeleton
and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex and the synaptonemal complex, affect homologous and non-homologous
interactions at specific loci. Dynein and microtubules interact with the LINC complex and are known to contribute
to RPMs. Aim 2 will identify additional motors and cytoskeleton components that support these movements,
building on our preliminary data uncovering kinesins as candidate molecular motors involved in generating
RPMs. We will extend these findings with unbiased proteomic approaches, functional assays and FROS to
decipher the dynamic forces that govern homolog pairing. Aim 3 will investigate the mechanism underlying the
association between ANKRD31 and pro-DSB factors at recombination hotspots. Using FROS, we will target
ANKRD31-GFP-lacI to the lacO region in spermatocytes, which we predict will recruit pro-DSB factors and
recombination proteins. We will also analyze the effect of ANKRD31-GFP-lacI on downstream recombination
intermediates at lacO sites. The proposed research will for the first time discern how chromosome context affects
the mechanisms underlying chromosome segregation and thus advance new knowledge of fundamental meiotic
processes and the causes of aneuploidy."
10891647,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tubules are characterized by a luminal space surrounded by polarized epithelial cells. Cell
polarization, that is the asymmetric segregation of polarity factors along the axis perpendicular
to the adhesion substrate (apicobasal polarity) or parallel to the epithelial sheet (planar cell
polarity), is required for the directionality of cellular functions and responses, such as absorption
and secretion, cell movement, and proliferation. The maintenance of apical-basal polarity relies
on the integration of mechanobiological signals deriving from cell-cell and cell-extracellular
matrix (ECM) interactions. Derailment of these concerted exchanges leads to tubular
malformations such as tubular dilation, or cystogenesis, and loss of tubule physiological
function, which are pathognomonic of polycystic kidney disease. However, to date, there has
been no experimental or computational studies that describe how biomechanical imbalance
could contribute to cystogenesis. Increasing evidence suggests that mutations in the Pkd1
gene, causative of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, are associated with
abnormalities in the core mechanosensitive machinery of epithelial cells. Our preliminary
findings indicate that the cystogenesis caused by the deletion of Pkd1 or the ciliary Ift88 gene
can be reverted to the normal phenotype by the ablation of integrin-?1, a main ECM receptor.
Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the equilibrium of the biomechanical forces
generated between intercellular junctions and ECM is essential to establish and maintain tubular
integrity. To test this hypothesis, we will use highly integrated theoretical and experimental
assays, including biophysical, cell biological, computational, and in vivo approaches. Our
approach can lead to the identification of novel drug targets that could reverse this
fundamentally unique biophysical disease mechanism. The proposed studies will establish a
comprehensive model of the biophysical mechanisms of renal cystogenesis, and they may
uncover new effector pathways that could be therapeutically targeted."
10890098,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Nigeria faces an increasing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular
diseases (CVDs), leading to an estimated 29% of all deaths in the country. In spite of this, contemporary data
demonstrate low implementation of recommended public health and clinical cardiovascular interventions,
including the WHO's Best Buys for NCDs in the country. The 2019 Nigerian Multisectoral Action Plan for the
Prevention and Control of NCDs demonstrates the country's commitment and prioritization to NCD prevention
and control across the lifespan and within primary care settings. However, there are a limited number of
Nigerian investigators, early stage investigators, and trainees with the necessary skills, training, and
experiences to implement and build upon this plan to improve cardiovascular health and patient-centered care.
 In this grant, we propose to strengthen implementation science, clinical trial, and patient-centered
outcomes research capacity within the University of Abuja, University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, and their
partners. Our long-term goal is to build a cadre of multidisciplinary researchers who will develop a high-quality,
contextualized evidence base to improve implementation and sustainment of recommended public health and
clinical strategies for better population and individual-level cardiovascular health and outcomes. The University
of Abuja has a successful track record of NIH-funded cardiovascular health research programs with a growing
faculty of accomplished investigators. Our novel, multidisciplinary training program in cardiovascular
implementation science, clinical trials, and patient-centered outcomes research will support short-, medium-,
and long-term trainings combined with capacity building in mentorship and curriculum design for sustainability.
Aim 1. Build capacity and experience in University of Abuja cardiovascular researchers to design and conduct
cardiovascular implementation science, clinical trials, and patient-centered outcomes research in Nigeria.
Aim 2. Develop a team of faculty leaders and mentors at University of Abuja who are able to provide
mentorship and training for new cardiovascular investigators and sustain the cardiovascular research agenda.
Aim 3. Advance in-country cardiovascular research agenda by formally integrating courses in implementation
science, clinical trials, and patient-centered outcomes research training into existing degree programs.
 This grant will support 5 post-doctoral fellows, 2 Master's degrees, and 2 PhD students through medium-
and long-term training. Short-term cardiovascular research skill building, mentorship, and teaching and
curriculum design workshops will train >250 participants in research methods, mentorship, and teaching.
Annual symposia will provide opportunities for the broader community of cardiovascular and NCD researchers
to disseminate their research and form new collaborations. Through this program, we will train a new
generation of independent Nigerian investigators, mentoring them on the path to independence, and leading
the way for University of Abuja to become a center for excellence for cardiovascular research in Nigeria."
10842364,"Project Summary
Understanding why we sleep remains one of the most enduring mysteries in science. Nearly every
organism examined, even jellyfish that lack a centralized nervous system, exhibits a restorative
sleep-like state. While asleep, we cannot eat, mate, defend ourselves from predators or care for
our young. Inadequate sleep contributes to brain disease such as Alzheimer's and depression,
and even diseases outside of the brain, such as diabetes and obesity. Sleep is homeostatically
regulated, i.e., sleep is driven by the duration and intensity of prior waking experience. However,
the mechanistic basis of the sleep homeostat remains unclear. How does wakefulness tax the
brain? How does the homeostat sense those effects? How does the homeostat trigger sleep?
How does sleep restore the brain? Almost uniquely among brain functions, sleep requires the
coordinated activity of widespread brain regions. We aim to reveal the molecular and circuit basis
of the sleep homeostat using a simple animal model Drosophila. We will apply innovative
genetically targeted transcriptomic and proteomic approaches such as single-cell RNA
sequencing and enzymatic proximity labeling in the compact Drosophila brain to provide insights
into sleep-dependent genomic and proteomic changes at single gene, single protein, and single
cell resolution. We will then exploit the power of Drosophila genetics to assess the functional
impact of sleep/wake dependent neurons and genes by examining effects on sleep including
sleep-dependent functions including memory consolidation and lifespan. Based on our discovery
that neural mechanisms controlling the circadian regulation of sleep are widely conserved, we
predict that core homeostatic mechanisms will similarly be widely conserved. The integration of
these experimental approaches will produce mechanistic insights that link gene to neuron to
behavior and should reveal transformative insights into the components, logic, and function of the
sleep homeostat."
10817879,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating and pervasive neurodegenerative disorder with no effective
treatments and is predicted to double in prevalence over the next 30 years. One of the first hallmarks of
AD is loss of synapses followed by amyloid beta aggregation and tau neurofibrillary tangles. The steps
leading to these aggregation events, especially in individuals with late-onset AD, are poorly understood.
To better comprehend the transcriptional mechanisms associated with synapse loss, we isolated synapses
in the form of synaptosomes and performed high throughput RNA sequencing. We found differentially
expressed mRNAs associated with the synapse in AD patients with implications for synaptic transport and
local mRNA translation. Notably, when interrogating the noncoding transcriptome, we found a widespread
shift of distribution of circular RNAs (circRNAs) from cell bodies to synapses. CircRNAs are stable
molecules formed from covalent linkages of conserved back-spliced exon junctions that can compete with
linear counterparts. Interestingly among the top differentially expressed circRNAs were two circRNAs from
GSK3β, which underwent a switch from one isoform significantly upregulated in AD to another significantly
downregulated. GSK3β phosphorylation of tau is essential for its aggregation and GSK3β inhibitors have
actively been pursued as translational targets for AD. Further evaluation of GSK3β and other circular RNAs
in a large RNAseq repository revealed differentially expressed circRNAs in PSEN2 surrounding exons
associated with hypoxia mediated alternative splicing. Therefore, key AD associated proteins have RNA
counterparts at the synapse that are differentially expressed that may have critical modulatory roles. Our
findings point to a novel mode of regulation at the RNA level. Through a series of in vitro studies and
mouse models of tau pathology, we propose to therapeutically modulate the expression of circGSK3B and
circPSEN2 isoforms to restore appropriate regulation of tau. We propose to ascertain whether regulatory
features surrounding alternative GSK3β exons affect circRNA production and whether RNA helicases
influence the GSK3β circRNA isoform switch that we observe. In addition, we will evaluate the relationship
between PSEN2 circRNA biogenesis and the role of oxidative stress in affecting aberrant PSEN2
alternative splicing – a phenomenon we observe to be significantly enriched in sporadic AD. Collectively,
we will leverage our understanding of the rules governing circRNA biogenesis and regulation to generate
molecules capable of preserving appropriate expression of GSK3β and prevent tau aggregation."

Psychiatric disorders are a set of chronic, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), a global public health problem
of enormous economic, social, and medical cost to the international community. Stress, alcohol use and other
factors (social and environmental; physical disorders) often exacerbate psychiatric disorders. Low and middle
income and developing countries are disproportionately affected due to both economic disadvantages and the
less well-established institutional infrastructures dedicated to the understanding, treatment and prevention of
psychopathology. We propose a collaborative research training program in the multidisciplinary, translational
research of stress, alcohol use and psychopathology between Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University in
Bangkok, Thailand (the lead Thai site) Phramongkutklao (PMK) Hospital, also in Bangkok, and Prince of Songkla
University (PSU) in Hat Yai, Thailand; and the Yale University School of Medicine in the U.S. The project is
directed by leaders in Thailand and the US, Dr. Kalayasiri at Chulalongkorn, and Drs. Potenza and Gelernter at
Yale, mPIs for this application. Three major training mechanisms are proposed for Thai trainees, including long-
term (1-2-yr) predoctoral and postdoctoral fellowships, and short-term (1-6 month) fellowships. During the five-
year program, training responsibility increases at Chulalongkorn, PMK, and PSU (as experience builds) and
decreases at Yale. This program builds on an extensive research program in Psychiatry at Yale University School
of Medicine, and on existing training and research collaborations between investigators at Yale and investigators
at Chulalongkorn in the study of the genetics and clinical correlates of psychopathology (especially substance
use disorders) in Thai populations. The program will contribute to the capacity of investigators at Chulalongkorn,
PMK and PSU and more generally in Thailand to conduct state-of-the-art research in interdisciplinary and
translational research in psychiatry through a range of training experiences (genetics, molecular biology, clinical,
developmental, psychopharmacology, clinical trials, neuroimaging, implementation, community, and policy
research); and has strong ongoing potential for clinical translation. The explicit long-term goal of the program will
be to build a critical mass of scientists, health professionals, and academics with expertise and a sustainable
research environment at the collaborating Thai institutions to better understand, treat, and prevent the NCDs of
psychiatric illnesses. This training program is also specifically designed to serve a major public health purpose
by enhancing Thailand’s capacity to confront major health concerns including alcohol and other stress-related
disorders that are unprecedented in Thailand’s history. The context of this program is a long-term research and
training collaboration between Yale and Chulalongkorn that focused on drug dependence which was co-led by

Environmental Neuroscience for All uses a combination of online and in-person tools and an open science
approach to support high school students in carrying out their own original research projects focusing on
environmental neuroscience, a fast-growing field of research at the intersection of behavioral science and more
‘traditional’ STEM fields that recognizes the critical role of human brain and behavioral science in better
understanding the impact that the environment has on humans, and the impact that humans have on our
environment. How is our brain health and wellbeing affected by our environment? Can we improve how we
interact with our environment by deepening our understanding of how the human brain is wired? Together with
scientists and their teachers and communities, students will explore these and other questions about the multi-
directional relationship between the human brain, human behavior, and our environment. We will build on the
technology, content, and network of schools and community partners created through our SEPA project
BrainWaves and our community science platform MindHive. We will develop curriculum materials and tools
grounded in open science practices, which represent a shift away from narrower, more traditional views of the
“scientific method,” toward a collaborative and iterative approach to science inquiry. We will also build out an
online platform with tools that support collaborative study ideation, peer feedback, data collection and
engagement, and communication. Students will learn how to formulate research questions and translate them
into testable hypotheses; design, review, and revise environmental neuroscience studies; and collect, analyze,
and communicate research findings. Together, the curriculum materials and web-based platform will support
authentic community science research spearheaded by teens in a network of environmental neuroscientists,
community organizations, and student peers - both locally and nationwide, and both in-person and online. In
sum, Environmental Neuroscience for All will connect geographically and socio-economically diverse learners
and communities; and in doing so create pathways toward more transparent, accessible, and inclusive
environmental science. As such, the project will not only help further integrate human brain and behavioral
science, an increasingly relevant STEM field, into preK-12 science curricula, but will also educate a new
generation of scientists in open science principles, building the foundations for a STEM workforce that
approaches environmental challenges as a collective, interdisciplinary effort."
10895399,"Inflammation presents as swelling, redness, heat, and lost-of-function and is essential for the restoration of
tissue homeostasis after injury and infection. Neutrophils are the major effector cells of acute inflammation that
combat infection, promote wound healing and resolution of inflammation, while contributing to collateral tissue
injury. In addition, neutrophils are exploited as vehicles that cross tissue barriers to deliver cargos to
inflammation sites. A better understanding of the neutrophil-intrinsic mechanisms that regulate neutrophil
migration will have broad translational importance in the prevention and treatment of a wide range of
inflammation-related diseases. The challenges associated with studying neutrophils are a limited set of genetic
tools and the plasticity of the cells in vivo. To address these challenges, the PI uses zebrafish, a genetically
tractable vertebrate model with a well-conserved innate immune system. Findings on neutrophil intrinsic genes
that regulate neutrophil migration generated in the zebrafish model are then validated in primary human or
murine neutrophils. MicroRNAs are small RNA molecules of 22-24 nt that regulate homeostasis in health and
disease. MicroRNA “mimics” and “inhibitors” are emerging as next-generation therapeutics because of their
ability to modulate a network of genes. In addition, microRNAs are being used as tools to discover novel
regulators of biological processes. A critical gap remains understanding how microRNAs regulate neutrophil
function: despite the prominent microRNA profiling studies in neutrophils and in various diseases, microRNA
functional studies are scarce. The PI’s lab has been at the forefront of addressing this unmet need by
characterizing microRNAs and their targets in neutrophil migration. Building on their recent progress, the first
project is to continue charactering microRNAs in regulating neutrophil migration with two sub aims: (1.1)
identify microRNA targets as novel regulators of neutrophil migration and inflammation, and (1.2) characterize
how RORα regulates neutrophil migration. A separate project is to characterize mechanisms delineating the
role of mitochondria in neutrophil migration. Mitochondria fission promotes migration in many cell types,
including lymphocytes, presumably by increasing mitochondria localization and ATP production at sites of high
energy demand. On contrary, neutrophils possess a highly fused mitochondrial network and primarily use
glycolysis for ATP generation, suggesting additional roles of mitochondria outside the realm of ATP.
Specifically, the PI seeks to (2.1) characterize how MFN2 regulates neutrophil migration. The hypothesis is that
MFN2-mediated mitochondrial-ER contact regulates Rac activation and neutrophil adhesion and migration.
The PI will continue to (2.2) identify additional mitochondrial related genes as novel regulators of neutrophil
migration and inflammation. An increased understanding of neutrophil migration and inflammation will open
multiple fronts in cell biology and immunology. Additionally, as a result of this work, previously underexplored
therapeutic possibilities to treat inflammatory diseases will come to light."

Racial/ethnic minority (REM) researchers, who may be uniquely poised to address racial/ethnic disparities in
mental and physical health, are underrepresented at all levels of the biomedical and behavioral sciences. Our
Manhattan-Bridge program seeks to enhance the number of REM students in biomedical and behavioral
sciences research by bridging the path from a minority-serving community college (Borough of Manhattan
Community College (BMCC)) to a baccalaureate degree in a STEM field at a minority-serving senior college
(The City College of New York (CCNY)). Manhattan-Bridge includes a coordinated system of faculty mentoring,
peer mentoring, peer support, diversity training, STEM coursework, laboratory training, tutoring, and
supplemental instruction to address and overcome the obstacles known to impede REM students from success
in completing their baccalaureate degrees and launching careers in biomedical fields. Each cohort of ten
students will be selected for a two-year education and training period during which we provide trainees with
research opportunities at BMCC and CCNY from experts in the biomedical and behavioral science fields to
guide development of mentored research projects. Trainees will be provided with conference travel and
research funds to facilitate their understanding of the conduct and dissemination of research findings. Key
activities include: 1) a Student Success course that examines the ways in which various psychological,
societal, cultural, and historical factors impact a transfer student’s academic experiences and outcomes, 2) a
Summer Research Training Institute where trainees complete a curriculum focusing on research methodology,
practical skills of data analysis, rudiments of neurocognitive research, and academic and clinical research
careers, and 3) regular meetings with a) peer mentors, who offer academic guidance and serve as a contact
and facilitator to mentees, and b) peer navigators, who support trainees in their social development in the
program and assist in addressing common emotional challenges, such as academic stress and poor coping
strategies. Objective outcomes include: 1) developing research self-efficacy; 2) attending a national scientific
conference; 3) presenting a paper or poster at a local or national conference; 4) application to a fellowship or
other training award; 5) author or co-author a scientific journal article; 6) conducting a honors-level research
project; 6) successful transfer to a baccalaureate program in the biomedical or behavioral sciences; and 7)
successful graduation from the baccalaureate degree."
10825615,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Control of RNA metabolism is emerging as a major hub for regulation in the brain. Therefore, it is not
surprising that there is a strong link between perturbation of RNA metabolism and a number of neurological
and neurodegenerative diseases. These include Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in which Tau protein and Aß42
fragments have been shown to interact and/or modulate directly or indirectly RNA binding proteins and RNA
metabolism in general. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly abundant RNAs produced by circularization of
specific exons. Interestingly, circRNAs accumulate in an age-dependent manner in neural tissues suggesting
their relevance to age-related homeostasis and/or pathogenesis. Indeed, specific circRNAs accumulate in
the brains of individuals with Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. However, how these circRNAs are
involved in the pathogenesis of those and other neurodegenerative diseases is largely unknown.
We recently developed systems to down- or up-regulate circRNAs in Drosophila. Using these tools, we
demonstrated the functionality of these molecules in vivo. We generated a resource to knock down (KD) the
110 more abundant circRNAs and found that KD of particular circRNAs results in different brain-related
phenotypes. Interestingly, we identified 35 circRNAs that when knocked down alter lifespan. Further data
shows that expression of some circRNAs is toxic for the aging fly, with links to aging and potentially
neurodegeneration. In addition, we found that KD of some circRNAs lead to specific behavioral and motor
defects, many of which are age-dependent. In addition, we observed changes in the levels of circRNAs in
Drosophila models of AD or other neurogenerative diseases. Here we aim to uncover the functions and
mechanisms of action of circRNAs during AD. To do so, we will use Drosophila AD models and perform a
genomic screening to determine if modulation of individual circRNAs can alter the progression and outcome
of the disease. Moreover, we will also test potential mechanisms by which circRNAs could alter AD including
nucleation of aggregates, altering mitochondrial function, autophagy, apoptosis, and/or inflammation.
In sum, the present proposal will reveal new roles of circRNAs during AD. As we will perform the
experiments in a system that has high and functional levels of circRNAs (the fly CNS) the present results will
be meaningful and could be later extended to mammalian models. We are aware of the limitations of the AD
fly models but this is the only system in which the full extent of interaction with a large number of circRNAs
can be assessed. Moreover, as we have already found that some circRNAs alter aging, the chances of
success are high. This will be a pioneering work in this new and important area of research and we are
confident that our findings will open a new pathway for studying the roles of circRNAs in AD. Our project
builds on exciting preliminary results and the unique and constantly evolving expertise of our group."

 The human lens contains high concentrations of the molecular chaperones, alpha-crystallins
(ACs), that maintain lens transparency. AC consists of alphaA- (AAC) and alphaB- (ABC) crystallins, both
distinct proteins, broadly similar in structure and function. Upon aging and in age-related cataract (ARC),
AC is bound to the lens fiber cell membrane which leads to the loss of transparency. It is unclear which
of the two proteins (AAC or ABC) binds to the membrane, or if both do, and how; but the binding does
promote opacity. Therefore, to eventually delay or mitigate lens opacity it is important to first determine
the molecular basis underlying such binding. AAC is primarily lens specific − unlike ABC − and is present
at about three times higher concentration. There is more evidence implicating AAC than ABC in direct
membrane binding – therefore AAC is our focus here. The lens membrane is unique in composition, and
contains elevated levels of sphingomyelin (SM), dihydrosphingomyelin (DSM), and cholesterol. Aging-
related protein modifications and membrane compositional changes appear to result in a significant
increase in ACs binding to the membrane, especially in the population of AAC-containing intramolecular
disulfides (S-S). This raises the question: Do the well-known aging-related AAC modifications, i.e., (i)
truncation of C-terminal Ser (AAC-1-172), and (ii) deamidation of Asn 101 (AAC-N101D), or (iii) its “pre-
senile” cataract-associated G98R mutant, show increased membrane-binding relative to AAC? To
distinguish these processes, we hypothesize that AAC binds to SM (and DSM), aided by other
phospholipids (PLs), and modulated by cholesterol in the human lens membrane. The
disulfide-oxidized form of AAC may play a role in this process. For clearly defining the role of
individual membrane-lipid components, we will use liposomes (membrane mimics with defined
compositions) instead of human lens membranes, and recombinant human crystallins. For a
comprehensive understanding of the binding process, we will use targeted biophysical techniques: FTIR
(for SM, cholesterol, and protein); Raman (for −SH and SS bonds and bond strength); CD (for protein
conformation); solution NMR (for residue-specific structural information), and Langmuir balance (to
measure lipid-monolayer insertion by AAC). We propose the following specific aims:
 1. Characterize AAC binding to the membrane and define the role of, (i) lipid composition, and (ii)
oxidized AAC in membrane binding. 2. Determine if (i) membrane binding increases in age-modified
AAC forms (AAC-1-172, & AAC-N101D), and (ii) the “pre-senile” G98R mutant; and if (iii) the oxidized
age-modified AAC forms play a role in membrane binding."
10827986,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is characterized by progressive fibrofatty replacement of the
myocardium, arrhythmias, and sudden death. Fibrofatty substitution in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy
contributes to worsening arrhythmogenesis by creating a non-conductive substrate, and causes ventricular
dysfunction leading to heart failure. The mechanisms underlying this disease are still unclear; a better
understanding of the pathogenesis is needed to find better options for clinical management. To address this
challenge, reliable species-specific models are needed; here we propose to develop a novel human model,
that will serve as a system to study the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrofatty infiltration. This study integrates
engineering and biomedical sciences, applying tissue engineering, cardiac physiology, bioinformatics and stem
cell technologies. Our long-term goal is to provide a model of fibrofatty myocardial infiltration to investigate
underlying disease mechanisms, which will lead to the development of greatly needed therapies for patients
who suffer from cardiac diseases related to the presence of fibrofatty infiltration. The central objective of this
proposal is to demonstrate that fibrofatty infiltration of the myocardium can be replicated in a 3D engineered
cardiac tissue, resembling deficient contractility and altered electrophysiological properties that mimic what is
observed in patients that suffer from ACM. The molecular signatures of fibrofatty infiltration in the context of our
engineered cardiac tissue model will also be analyzed. We will approach this in two aims. In Aim 1 we will
develop a 3D engineered cardiac tissue model of fibrofatty infiltration of the myocardium using hiPSCs from
patients with ACM. We will combine hiPSC-cardiomyocytes and hiPSC-epicardial cells treated to undergo
epithelial-mesenchymal transition; aiming to resemble the ACM functional phenotype. In Aim 2, exploiting the
role of the epicardium as source of fibrofatty infiltration; we will develop a 3D engineered cardiac tissue model
of myocardial fibrofatty infiltration using hiPSCs from healthy donors. In this study, we propose a strategy
based on evidence that fibrofatty infiltration is induced from epicardial activation; hiPSC-derived epicardial cells
will be treated to induce their further differentiation into fibroblasts and adipocytes. We will examine functional
and structural properties, along with single-cell transcriptomics of the engineered cardiac tissue models. We
expect that results from this study will advance our understanding of the contribution of specific cues from
ACM-related cells in the pathogenesis of fibrofatty remodeling; our physiologically relevant model will serve to
unravel the cell-cell cross-talk and mechanisms responsible for initiation and progression of fibrofatty infiltration
of the myocardium. This project will improve the health of patients with ACM by leading the development of a
human model of the disease and accelerating the application of biomedical technologies to interrogate disease
mechanisms, which will aid in the identification of novel therapeutic targets."

of the Physician Scientist Training Program (PSTP) and currently a T32 research fellow at Dr. Drakos laboratory
at the Nora Eccles Harrison Cardiovascular Research and Training Institute (CVRTI). Dr. Tseliou’s research
project is focused on the impact of fatty acid (FA) metabolism on cardiac remodeling and myocardial recovery.
Dr. Tseliou’s long-term goal is to independently direct an extramurally funded laboratory with research focused
on metabolic mechanisms that affect cardiac heart failure (HF) and recovery. Career Development: This award
will support Dr. Tseliou’s career development by building on her existing training in cardiovascular (CV) health
and disease. Dr. Tseliou will receive extensive training in the planning and execution of studies investigating
myocardial FA metabolism in humans, animal models and in vitro. The career development plan outlines a
coordinated effort to train the candidate in areas including mass-spectrometry based lipidomic and metabolomic
assessment of serum and tissue in HF; development and phenotyping of animal transgenic models of HF. Hands-
on learning and mentoring opportunities will be complimented by broader training in current topics by regular
attendance of didactic courses (research training, research interactions, career guidance, publications, research
ethics and grant writing) molecular cardiology seminars and conferences. Environment: The University of Utah
is an ideal environment for Dr. Tseliou’s career development. The CVRTI is a freestanding research institute
located at the UU Health Sciences Center with a long-standing commitment to the promotion and advancement
of early-career investigators in the field of CV biology. CVRTI faculty is well-funded and have excellent track
records in mentoring junior physician-scientists to become independent investigators. This environment has a
long and very rich history of excellence in basic and translational CV research and will provide Dr. Tseliou with
the opportunity of collaboration across different specialties and the resources needed to complete the proposed
studies. Moreover, the UU and Dr. Drakos integrated basic science and clinical research team will provide Dr.
Tseliou with the unique opportunity to phenotype left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) patients with and without
myocardial recovery, who are the source of precious serial human myocardial tissue and serum before and after
the therapeutic intervention. Research: The central hypothesis of this project is that reduced cardiac specific
expression of UGCG (UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase, a gene that catalyzes the glycosylation of
ceramide) leads to the deregulation of FA metabolism and predisposes to HF. We seek to understand the
mechanisms responsible for these phenomena. While several mechanisms of FA metabolism have been
described, we contend that there are unexplored pathways influenced by altered ceramide:GlcCer balance as
they relate to CV health and disease. Specifically, we hypothesize that UGCG overexpression in HF may help
reverse cardiac hypertrophy and ventricular dilation, improve cardiac function and restore CV health."

The Open Health Imaging Foundation (OHIF) Viewer and its underlying libraries such as Cornerstone have
become the standard framework for web-based imaging informatics technologies in cancer research and
beyond, supporting hundreds of open-source projects with thousands of users. Through OHIF, developers can:
1) add new innovative tools as extensions to the OHIF Viewer; 2) use specific OHIF modules or libraries to
build their own custom tools; and 3) web-enable existing desktop informatics platforms. To support the
transition from desktop to web-based tools, researchers need well-supported frameworks to build upon.
Currently, many cancer research image viewers require software to be installed on each user's local
workstation, a drawback which limits accessibility and ease of collaboration. Most web-viewers available today
are either proprietary, closed systems, or open-source research applications that use legacy technologies. For
cancer imaging research that requires multi-site collaboration, there is a growing need for a framework that can
enable researchers to review images and collaborate with colleagues remotely. OHIF’s zero-footprint web-
viewer tools provide enormous usability benefits for end users, who gain instant access to view data across
computers without any software to install or update.
 Under a prior NCI ITCR U24 grant, we developed the OHIF Framework, which provides a professional-
grade, free, open-source web-based imaging environment for cancer research with image review, annotation
functionality, and a user-friendly interface. The OHIF Viewer relies on standards, which has enabled easy
integration with other systems, and it can be extended to provide custom functionality without modifying the
core application. Additionally, its components can be re-used to rapidly develop new applications and help
enable the transition to cloud computing for cancer research tools.
 The core goal of this proposal is to enhance and sustain the OHIF platform and broaden the user and
contributor base of this technology. The current project has three aims: 1) extend the web-viewer’s cancer
imaging visualization and analysis capabilities; 2) reduce barriers to adoption by creating ready-to-use
installers for on-premises and cloud-hosted deployment; and 3) expand our support infrastructure for the
cancer research community. For community support, we will enhance our outreach, engagement, and support
initiatives to foster collaboration with developers and end users. In order to facilitate clinical translation and
share our experience with regulatory compliance, we will implement a quality management system (QMS) for
core OHIF framework development and regularly release design documentation to the community.
 Enhancing the platform's functionality, easing installation, and enriching support will allow researchers
to better collaborate to evaluate the nature of cancer disease progression and response to treatment. With the
widespread adoption of the OHIF platform to date, the impact of these improvements will be far reaching."

Essential chromosome biology such as chromosome segregation and the preservation of genome integrity are
conserved across the tree of life. Paradoxically, many proteins that support these chromosome functions are
unconserved—domains and residues evolve rapidly between even closely related species. A leading resolution
to this paradox posits that essential, chromosomal proteins evolve rapidly to keep pace with chromosomal
regions enriched with tandemly repeating DNA sequences prone to frequent changes in array size and
composition across short stretches of evolutionary time. This turnover of repetitive DNA imperils chromosome
functions, triggering adaptive evolution of chromosomal proteins to restore these functions. This conceptual
model of intra-genomic coevolution was proposed two decades ago, and yet the DNA repeats, the chromosomal
proteins, and the vital chromosome biology sculpted by intra-genomic coevolution are largely uncharacterized.
To experimental test this model, I generate an “evolutionary mismatch” between contemporary DNA repeats in
Drosophila melanogaster and a fast-evolving chromosomal proteins from its closely related sister species D.
simulans. To generate these mismatches, I leverage CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing to swap native
chromosomal proteins from D. melanogaster with diverged versions from D. simulans. Using this approach, my
recent work demonstrates an incompatibility specifically between the D. simulans allele of the ovary-enriched
chromosomal protein, MH, and the D. melanogaster-specific 359bp repeats. My findings revealed that
DNA:protein coevolution is required to preserve genome integrity in the female germline. This system is now
uniquely poised to reveal the chromosome biology and evolutionary consequences sculpted by coevolution.
Here I integrate evolutionary, cell biology, and biochemistry approaches to investigate the chromosome biology
preserved by 359bp:MH coevolution. I also probe how 359bp:MH coevolution reverberates beyond the
DNA:protein interface, triggering a secondary coevolutionary process that may result in an interspecies hybrid
incompatibility. Finally, I explore the pervasiveness and the consequences of evolutionary innovation at the
dynamic MH gene family across the Drosophila phylogeny."

 Patients with gastrointestinal (GI) metastases in the peritoneal cavity suffer high morbidity,
chemotherapy resistance, and decreased overall survival. The molecular mechanism and phenotypic features
that facilitate peritoneal metastasis are poorly understood, although mucin-expressing tumors exhibit especially
high predilection for peritoneal spread. Preliminary analyses determined in a pan-cancer patient cohort that
mucinous GI tumors are highly enriched in a specific mutation in GNAS that leads to pathogenic gain-of-
function in the encoded G protein alpha subunit (GNAS). GNAS mutations are associated with pancreatic and
small cell lung tumor development, yet the pathogenic mechanism mobilized by GNAS to facilitate metastasis
is unknown. Preliminary data demonstrates that patients with GNAS-mutated GI cancers exhibit increased
burden of peritoneal metastases, decreased response to first-line chemotherapy, and poor overall survival.
Analysis of tumor DNA and RNA from independent groups of patient tumors shows that mutated GNAS may
operate within a distinct gene-regulatory network that activates PI3K and MAPK signaling. The PI and
collaborators established GNAS-mutated, patient-derived-organoids (PDOs) and a peritoneal metastasis
mouse model to evaluate the hypothesis that GNAS is a key molecular driver that governs the signaling
pathway involved in metastatic peritoneal seeding and growth.
 To test this hypothesis, the study will (1) define the GNAS-induced gene regulatory networks and
phenotypic features that facilitate tumor progression in patient peritoneal metastasis and CRISPR-Cas9 gene-
edited PDOs and (2) determine the impact of GNAS modulation on metastasis distribution and pathogenicity in
vivo using xenograft metastatic models. Investigations will integrate multi-omic analyses with PDO
experimental validation to improve the fundamental understanding of metastasis and validate GNAS signaling
as a therapeutically-relevant target. The applicant, Dr. Michael Foote, is a rising Assistant Attending in the GI
Oncology Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). Dr. Foote has defined a 5-year plan
to integrate his background in targeted drug development and computational bioinformatics with new expertise
in experimental modeling and molecular biology. Dr. Foote will be mentored by a complementary advisory
committee led by Dr. Luis Diaz, an international expert in genomics with a strong background in training
successful independent physician scientists. Dr. Foote’s development plan includes supportive workshops and
mentoring from an advisory committee of experts in molecular biology, cell signaling, and bioinformatics at
MSKCC, a world-renowned translational center of excellence. Completion of the project goals will facilitate new
therapeutic approaches for treating metastatic GI cancer and Dr. Foote’s development into an independent
physician scientist and expert leader in GI metastasis."
10870169,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Accurate assessment of risk is a top priority in oncology due to the population burden of cancer. Breast cancer
is the leading cancer diagnosis among women worldwide and accordingly has the longest and broadest focus
on risk prediction. Most traditional prediction models only utilize baseline factors known to be associated with
breast cancer risk. More recent models expand to place greater emphasis on genomic risk factors. However,
the predominant move of adding genomic risk markers incorporates a measure that is invariant to time (based
on SNPs) and do not necessarily solve the challenge of improving breast cancer risk classification. The
intrinsic heterogeneity between and within patients over time are reflected in part, by the time-varying covariate
trajectories, which may provide important information for the prediction of breast cancer risk. The accumulation
of cancer risk over life, well documented for breast cancer, is ideally suited to methods that incorporate time-
varying covariates. Theobjective of this proposal is toprovide novel statistical models that can incorporate
patient heterogeneity in a personalized, dynamic manner leading to a more accurate risk prediction scheme.
The proposed algorithms encompass innovative functional approaches to comprehensively characterize the
changing pattern of the longitudinal trajectories by a set of outcome-independent/unsupervised and outcome-
dependent/supervised features. The set of individual-specific features will contain information on the observed
time-varying `pattern' rather than one-time exposure in existing methods, leading to a higher predictive power.
The dynamic prediction models will be built in a stepwise fashion, starting with a single time-varying covariate,
and extended to the multivariate settings, to accommodate multiple time-varying covariates. The proposed
methods will be applied to the Nurses' Health Study and further assessed externally in the Mayo
Mammography Health Study. All of the proposed methods will be accompanied with user-friendly open-source
software."

 During chronic fungal infections, heterogeneous subpopulations can arise. While these diversified
populations can pose significant challenges for treatment, they also provide an opportunity to identify pathways
under selection in vivo. This proposal focuses on the study of unique longitudinally-collected sets of Candida
(Clavispora) lusitaniae isolates from three individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). In each case, the C. lusitaniae
infections replaced prior chronic bacterial infections, were associated with high levels of airway inflammation,
and were resistant to treatment. C. lusitaniae is an emerging agent of candidiasis known to develop resistance
to antifungal drugs and is a close relative of Candida auris, a multidrug resistant pathogen that has repeatedly
caused hospital associated outbreaks with high mortality. Through the genomic and phenotypic analysis of
variable traits in these chronic infection populations, via a productive collaboration between the Hogan and
Stajich Labs, we found striking heterogeneity in two genes: MRR1, which encodes a transcription factor known
for its ability to confer resistance to azoles, bacterial toxins, and host antimicrobial peptides, and MRS4, a
mitochondrial iron transporter that affects metabolism and metal uptake. We propose that these genes strongly
impact host interactions and fungal physiology in vivo. Our studies revealed that Mrr1 controls a large regulon of
resistance, metabolic and metal acquisition genes, and we discovered the first endogenous inducer of Mrr1,
methylglyoxal (MG), which spontaneously forms from intermediates in glycolysis. Further, we found that repeated
loss-of-function mutations in a second gene, MRS4, biases cells towards a glycolytic metabolism, increased MG
production, and increased Mrr1 signaling. We propose that these changes promote survival in an inflammatory
environment. Specifically, we propose to test the hypotheses that (Aim 1) endogenous MG directly stimulates
inducible Mrr1 variants, (Aim 2) that MRS4 loss-of-function mutations induce MG Mrr1 signaling through
increased glycolysis, and (Aim 3) that increased glycolysis decreases ROS accumulation in co-culture with
activated neutrophils. As we show in published and preliminary data, the pathways and mechanisms studied
here are conserved broadly across diverse Candida pathogens including C. auris. Through this work, we aim to
further develop our understanding of C. auris, and ways in which C. lusitaniae can be used as a highly tractable,
parallel system with an expanded tool kit including genetic, genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic resources. We
propose that the studies will reveal new broadly relevant mechanisms by which fungi adapt to the host environment
which can inform new treatment strategies."

Philadelphia-positive acute lymhoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) and Ph1-like B-ALL account for most cases of
“high-risk” adult B-ALL. Current therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have improved the outcome of
Ph+ ALL, but resistance to TKIs develops rapidly in most patients. Ph1-like B-ALL is currently treated with
intensive combination chemotherapy but disease relapse is common with a 5-year survival in only ~25% of
patients. As a result, the prognosis of Ph+ ALL and Ph1-like B-ALL remains dismal. In previous studies, we
showed that Ph+ and Ph1-like ALL cells exhibit a selective requirement for CDK6 expression while CDK4
expression is dispensable. CDK6 is the catalytic subunit of the cyclin D/CDK6 complex which is essential for
the G1 to S-phase cell cycle transition and has kinase-independent growth-promoting effects in hematological
malignancies. Our preliminary studies indicate that CDK6 silencing is more effective than CDK6 enzymatic
inhibition in suppressing Ph+ ALL in mice. To block kinase-dependent and independent effects of CDK6, we
have developed CDK4/6-targeted proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTACs) that inhibit CDK4/6 enzymatic
activity in vitro and promote the preferential degradation of CDK6 over CDK4 in Ph+ and Ph1-like ALL cells,
providing durable suppression of CDK6 function. In this proposal, we will assess the requirement of CDK6 in
Ph+ and Ph1-like ALL by comparing the effects of CDK6 degradation by PROTAC YX-2-107 and
pharmacological inhibition using Palbociclib, an FDA-approved CDK4/6 inhibitor (Aim 1.1). We will also
determine whether the more potent leukemia suppression induced by CDK6 down-regulation in comparison to
CDK6 enzymatic inhibition can be explained by changes in gene expression induced selectively by CDK6
silencing. Such changes involve the histone deacetylase 1(HDAC1) gene and several others involved in
mitochondrial metabolic pathways (Aims 1.2 and 1.3). Although we have been able to achieve high specificity
of CDK6 versus CDK4 targeting and biological/therapeutic effects comparable/superior to Palbociclib ex vivo
and in PDXs of Ph+ ALL, we will continue to improve our lead compound PROTAC YX-2-107 by medicinal
chemistry approaches in order to develop derivatives with enhanced in vivo efficacy. In Aim 2, we will assess
metabolic properties of select CDK6-degrading PROTACs and test their biological/therapeutic effects in Ph+
and Ph1-like ALL cells ex vivo and in mice injected with de novo or relapsed/TKI-resistant patient-derived
Ph+/Ph1-like ALL cells. Collectively, our PROTAC-based approach which leverages the expertise in cancer
biology and medicinal chemistry of the Calabretta and Salvino's laboratories holds promise to develop novel
and more effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of CDK6-dependent high-risk B-ALL in pre-clinical PDX
models and, potentially, in the clinic."

A primary mission of Animal Resources Divisions at National Primate Research Centers (NPRC) is to maintain
the overall social health of Indian-origin rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) living in large multi-generational
breeding groups in order to ensure the availability of high-quality research subjects for NIH-funded research.
The social dynamics of these breeding groups, however, are complex and disturbances in their dominance
hierarchy and kinship structures can lead to increased aggression and fighting that may result in significant
wounding. Thus, a common challenge in their management is the utilization of effective social heath surveillance
methodology to identify groups at risk for social instability before the onset of significant fighting. These captive
groups are routinely monitored for changes in dominance ranks and rates of trauma to detect social instability at
the family- and group-level; however, the precise timing of severe outbreaks of aggression is largely considered
unpredictable. Further, the frequency of interactions that define dominance and affiliative relationships in these
groups are sparse; thus, the gathering of enough behavioral data to unequivocally detect social instability is time-
consuming. We recently published a report that indicated automated feeding data can provide critical real-time
data and assist management with monitoring social stability in rhesus macaque breeding groups, by possibly
predicting the timing of intense aggression. The purpose of this proposal is to expand upon these observations
by establishing data-driven models that help management identify groups at risk for social instability. Because
automated feeding data include precise timestamps and the order in which animals feed, network analyses can
be used to construct Feeding Interaction Networks (FINs), allowing us to examine patterns of temporal proximity
feeding among kin and non-kin. Because reproductive status also influences food intake in female monkeys, we
will study six outdoor breeding groups at the Yerkes NPRC across the breeding and birthing seasons, and
integrate social and reproductive data, with the overarching aim to develop comprehensive data-driven FIN
models that will enhance colony management practices of NIH-supported rhesus macaque breeding colonies.
Aim 1 will characterize the community structures within static FINs of rhesus macaque breeding groups, varying
in size and composition. Aim 2 will determine whether the directionality and strength of connections between
adult females within a static FIN can be used to predict patterns of affiliative and dominance relationships among
kin and non-kin. Aim 3 will quantify and model the temporal changes of community structures within dynamic
FINs of rhesus macaque groups across the breeding and birthing season with respect to female reproductive
phase. Finally, Aim 4 will detect changes in the community structures of dynamic FINs, not associated with
reproductive seasonality, that are precursor to increased aggression and other signs of social instability. These
FIN models will be used to supplement behavioral and trauma data, allowing management to identify groups at
risk for social instability and develop strategies to intervene prior to the escalation of additional aggression."

 Signaling proteins, including G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), impact genome modulators,
including ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers (ADCRs), to control gene expression in
homeostasis and disease. The signaling and chromatin regulators operative in epidermis, however,
have not been fully characterized, in part due to the hundreds of genes that comprise each of these
classes of proteins. This cycle, AR049737 knocked out all 101 GPCR and 116 ADCR genes
expressed in epidermis to identify essential roles for the ADGRL2 adhesion GPCR as well as for
ncBAF and SRCAP ADCRs in controlling epidermal differentiation. This revised competing renewal
will define the mechanistic basis for these new essential actions, sustaining the long-term focus of
AR049737 in characterizing signaling and genome regulators of epidermal homeostasis.
 First, we will test a working model in which the ADGRL2 GPCR is activated by FLRT3 and/or
TENM2 from adjacent cells to induce pro-differentiation signals, which are modulated by specific
proteins that AR049737 recently found associated with the ADGRL2 cytoplasmic domain in
differentiating keratinocytes. These proteins include the RapGEF2 guanine nucleotide exchange
factor and the PPP2R2A phosphatase, which are posited to enable ADGRL2-pro-differentiation
signaling, and the RASAL2 GTPase-activating protein, which is postulated to oppose it. Aim I will
test key features of this model using genetic approaches in tissue to illuminate the mechanistic
basis for the actions of the ADGRL2 GPCR in epidermal differentiation.
 Second, we will study the premise that the diverse impacts of ADCRs are enabled by the specific
ADCR-associated proteins that target their actions across the genome. These efforts focus on
ncBAF, which AR049737 found to be essential for induction of epidermal differentiation genes and
SRCAP, which AR049737 found to be essential to suppress ectopic differentiation in keratinocyte
progenitors. We will define the impact of DNA sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) on
ncBAF and SRCAP targeting and activity in epidermal homeostasis, including IRF6, which co-
regulates nBAF differentiation genes, and SNAI2, which co-suppresses SRCAP differentiation
targets. Aim II will thus use genomics approaches to define the molecular mechanisms responsible
for the opposite impacts of ncBAF and SRCAP ADCRs in epidermal differentiation.
 At the end of proposed funding, this effort will have defined mechanistic features of newly
identified essential roles for GPCRs and ADCRs in the control of epidermal homeostasis."
10890718,"ABSTRACT. Systemic racism exposes Black and Latinx adolescents to a range of traumatic stressors,
including publicized instances of police brutality toward Black people, stressful personal interactions with
hostile police officers, and oppressive immigration policies. The combination of systemic racism and the
coronavirus-19 pandemic (COVID-19)--termed the “twin pandemics”—are placing Black and Latinx
adolescents, especially those in under-resourced communities, at particularly high risk for family financial
strain, food insecurity, school disruption, and illnesses and deaths of loved ones. Cumulative stressors during
the critical developmental period of adolescence increase risk for long-term emotional and behavioral problems
into adulthood; thus, it is urgent that we: (1) understand the impact of cumulative race-related stress on
marginalized adolescents during and after the pandemic and (2) identify protective factors that promote their
resilience and wellbeing. Researchers have theorized that one protective factor may be critical consciousness,
or the awareness of societal inequities and activism to promote social justice. We lack rigorous longitudinal
research, however, on the development of critical consciousness among marginalized youth, its association
over time with emotional and behavioral health (EBH), and its potential to protect again harmful effects of race-
related stress. The proposed longitudinal study will assess race-related stress, critical consciousness, and
EBH among Black, Latinx, and White adolescents in Baltimore. We will leverage participants and data from an
NICHD-funded trial with longitudinal data collected at four time points prior to COVID with ethnically diverse
adolescents in Baltimore City. We will augment this sample by recruiting additional Baltimore adolescents, for a
total sample of 650 young people ages 14-18, with approximately equal numbers of Black, Latinx, and White
participants. We will follow these young people over four years (until ages 18-22). Participants will complete
online surveys twice per year assessing race-related stress exposures, critical consciousness, and three
domains of EBH (emotional wellness, mental health problems, and substance use). We will conduct in-depth
interviews with a subset of Black and Latinx youth and, separately, with their caregivers to gain more insight
into how youth engage in critical consciousness/activism and its effects. Qualitative themes will enrich our
quantitative analyses on critical consciousness and its potential protection against the harms of race-related
stress. We will develop a Youth Advisory Board to engage input from young people in our target population at
all stages of this research. Using procedures effective in our prior work, we will also train young people to
conduct the qualitative interviews with adolescent participants to enhance trust and rapport. Study analyses will
be critical for expanding theory on risk and resilience among marginalized adolescents transitioning into
adulthood. Findings will also directly inform policy and intervention strategies to promote youth mental health
equity, including interventions to promote youth critical consciousness and social justice activism."
10896188,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Despite the ubiquitous role of fibrosis in tissue dysfunction arising from aging and disease, no representative
in vitro model of the fibrotic microenvironment exists. Fibrosis is characterized by excess extracellular matrix
(ECM) deposition that stiffens the cellular microenvironment. Therefore, to model fibrosis in vitro, cell culture
substrates that permit quantitative, dynamic tuning of matrix mechanics are necessary. However, existing
dynamic hydrogel culture platforms generally rely on chemistries that may be toxic to cells or that simultaneously
change multiple parameters, making it difficult to assign causal relationships between altered matrix properties
and cell fate changes. Fibrotic stiffening occurs in a wide range of tissues, including the skeletal muscles, liver,
lungs, and heart. Numerous genetic cardiomyopathies are characterized by progressive fibrotic stiffening that
precedes heart failure. While fibrotic stiffening is known to impair the heart’s ability to pump blood, the impact of
stiffening on the phenotype of individual cardiomyocytes remains poorly understood. The goal of this research
proposal is to develop an in vitro model of tissue fibrosis based on dynamic hydrogel biomaterials that enables
real time measurement of cellular dysfunction to determine how progressive fibrotic stiffening detrimentally
impacts cell fate. As a model system, we will interrogate the effects of stiffening on human cardiomyocytes
differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells from Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients. DMD is
an ideal model system for studying outside-in mechanosignaling, as DMD arises from a lack of dystrophin, a
structural protein linking the contractile cytoskeleton to the ECM. We will use the dynamic hydrogels developed
during this research to assess contractile dysfunction, aberrant activation of mechanotransduction signaling, and
novel molecular mechanisms of “mechanical memory” arising from fibrotic stiffening.
 In Aim 1, we will develop a synthetic hydrogel system that uses near-infrared light and bioorthogonal
reactions to dynamically stiffen the gels, mimicking fibrosis. These hydrogels will be used to determine how
contractile dysfunction arises from fibrotic stiffening. In Aim 2, we will determine how increased stiffness alters
biochemical signaling in cardiomyocytes, focusing both on “canonical” mechanotransduction through Rho
GTPases and YAP signaling and on a new mechanosensitive pathway in actively contracting cells that involves
mechanical generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, and impaired mitochondrial biogenesis.
In Aim 3, we will investigate the first example of “mechanical memory” in cardiomyocytes. We will develop a
hydrogel platform that is stiffened by one wavelength of light and subsequently softened by a second wavelength.
This system will enable identification of molecular mechanisms by which exposure to a stiffened
microenvironment causes persistent cellular dysfunction and strategies to reverse this memory. The engineered
platforms developed will be broadly useful for studying fibrosis in progressive genetic diseases as well as aging."

COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, continues to devastate the world. In less than a year,
there have been more than 20 million cases with over 700,000 deaths. The viral RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp) is the central enzyme responsible for transcription and replication of the viral RNA
genome. This enzyme is also a target for the current antiviral, remdesivir, used to ameliorate the severity and
duration of this disease. The virus also encodes several nucleic acid processing enzymes, in addition to the
RdRp, including a helicase, an endonuclease, an exonuclease, and methyltransferases. However, it is
unknown how these enzymes coordinate to transcribe and replicate the viral genome. This proposal builds
upon preliminary data of the structure of the helicase, nsp13, in complex with the RdRp and a primed substrate
RNA (nsp13-replication/transcription complex or nsp13-RTC). The aims here include completing the structural
analysis of this complex by utilizing additional data collected. The result of this aim will provide higher
resolution (better than 2.7 Å in some parts the RdRp), providing a rich basis for the development of antiviral
inhibitors. Also, having this structure in hand allows for the collaboration with expert developers of
antimicrobials, also part of the aims, including the investigation of the structural details of the pre-incorporation
state of remdesivir and antivirals produced by human microbiome.
The models resulting from the structure of nsp13-RTC serve as foundations to test how the helicase and
exonuclease function together with the RdRp. Specifically, real-time fluorescence assays, single-molecule
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and multi-color fluorescence microscopy will be used to probe
the role of the helicase and the exonuclease in unwinding substrate RNA, backtracking, and proofreading.
Another aim applies the pipeline used to characterize the nsp13-RTC assembly, which yielded a high-
resolution structure of the complex, to other RTC assemblies. Specifically, native electrophoretic mobility
assays will be used as a starting point to probe larger assemblies of the RTC. Native mass-spectrometry will
then be used to determine the composition and stoichiometry of the complexes. Finally, cryo-EM will be
applied to solve the structures of these macromolecular machines. The resulting structures will provide a
starting point to elucidate the coordinated functions of these enzymes, provide insight into their mechanisms,
and establish novel targets for therapeutics.
In summary, this proposal aims to understand at the molecular and structural level how the SARS-CoV-2
nucleic acid processing enzymes coordinate to replicate and transcribe the viral genome, and to provide
structure-guided targets for drug discovery, with the ultimate goal of providing relief for the COVID-19
pandemic."
10814404,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Microvascular dysfunction underlies a wide range of devastating diseases, from Alzheimer’s Disease to cancer.
However, mechanisms underlying vessel maintenance that become dysregulated in vascular-related pathologies
are still emerging, fueling the advancement of blood-based diagnostics and bioengineered therapeutics. We
recently identified a truncated, alternative splice variant of Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor-β (PDGFRβ)
that encodes a soluble PDGFRβ isoform (sPDGFRβ), which may harbor potential as a future diagnostic and
therapeutic target. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), like PDGFRβ, often have soluble counterparts that are
generated via alternative splicing to function as “decoy” receptors to negatively regulate ligand-induced signaling
of the full-length receptor. Full-length PDGFRβ is expressed by pericytes (PCs) to mediate their recruitment to
microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) producing the cognate ligand Platelet-Derived Growth Factor BB (PDGF-
BB) – where PCs promote vessel stability and tune permeability. However, microvascular PC density and vessel
permeability vary between tissues and specialized vascular beds, with vessel dysfunction often associated with
PC loss and misregulated PDGFRβ--PDGF-BB signaling. Thus PDGFRβ-mediated PC recruitment is vital to
vessel integrity, although the exact mechanisms that govern it remain unclear. Recent studies report a large
sPDGFRβ produced via proteolytic cleavage in cerebral pathology scenarios. However, our data indicate that a
small sPDGFRβ is generated via alternative splicing in a broad range of normal, healthy tissues, though it is also
likely involved in disease states. We recently elucidated the full mRNA sequence of sPdgfrb, enabling targeted
manipulation and analysis approaches. In addition to broad and differential expression across various tissues,
our preliminary findings indicate overlap with full-length Pdgfrb (fPdgfrb)-expressing cells in mouse brain, and
presence of immunolabled, non-vessel associated sPDGFRβ protein signal in the brain parenchyma. These
findings, considered alongside established mechanisms of ligand sequestration in related RTKs, inform our
hypothesis that PDGF-BB bioavailability is regulated by alternatively spliced sPDGFRβ to mediate PC-vessel
recruitment and tune vessel permeability. Therefore, using complementary in vitro and in vivo models, we
propose investigation of sPDGFRβ potential to bind and regulate (i) PDGF-BB bioavailability, (ii) activation of
full-length PDGFRβ (fPDGFRβ), (iii) PC dynamics, and (iv) developing vessel morphology and permeability. We
will investigate sPDGFRβ cell-specificity, and spatio-temporal distribution in various tissues to determine the
extent of its functional role. In addition, we will assess the potential of sPDGFRβ as a biomarker and treatment
in vascular-related pathologies involving PC loss. This work will advance our understanding of mechanisms
underlying vessel maintenance and integrity, and lay the groundwork for follow-on collaborative studies aiming
to develop sPDGFRβ as a potential diagnostic tool and therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases."

The goal of lower limb rehabilitation after stroke is recovery of independent walking at home and in the
community. Few stroke survivors achieve this goal. Suboptimal outcomes are due to the serious and
intransigent nature of movement impairments caused by stroke and the scarcity of feasible and effective
therapies that restore movement lost to stroke.
Our team has developed a novel exercise intervention called CUped (pronounced cupid, like the Roman god)
to address barriers to recovery and improve walking after stroke. CUped is so called because it compels use of
the paretic limb during a movement that resembles pedaling. This project will examine safety, acceptability,
and tolerance to CUped, characterize its therapeutic effects, and identify dose-response relationships. Results
will provide preliminary data for an R01 to support a randomized controlled trial (RCT).
CUped is designed to help stroke survivors recover lower limb movement lost to stroke, thereby improving
walking. It is intended to be used as an adjunct to gait training. CUped uses a robotic technology that
eliminates compensatory movements that interfere with recovery, compels use of the paretic lower limb, and
targets 3 key movement impairments caused by stroke: decreased muscle output from the paretic limb,
inappropriate paretic muscle timing, and abnormal interlimb coordination. Exercise is done in sitting which
enables high repetition practice. Like walking, CUped requires continuous, reciprocal use of both lower limbs;
effects are likely to transfer to walking.
The risk-reward profile of this proposal is ideal for an R21, which is an NIH funding opportunity intended to
encourage exploratory/developmental research by providing support for the early and conceptual stages of
project development. CUped is a novel therapy grounded in a physiologic premise and based on prior
observations from our laboratory. We have pilot data suggesting that CUped fulfills its design specifications,
and this study will be the first to test its therapeutic effects. In this Stage 1 rehabilitation trial, we will support or
quickly refute the hypothesis that CUped is safe, acceptable, and capable of eliciting a therapeutic response in
stroke survivors. We will also examine tolerance to CUped and dose-response effects. If our hypotheses are
supported, we will be poised to run an RCT to isolate the effects of CUped and compare them to standard
care. Future work will investigate physiologic mechanisms underlying the effects of CUped."
10805495,"Nucleotide repeat expansion mutations cause progressive and lethal neurodegenerative
diseases such as Huntington’s Disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral schlerosis (ALS). The
molecular reasons for the pathological effects of these mutations remain elusive. Most research
has focused on the toxic effects of the mutant proteins. The expanded repeat RNA, however,
has more recently been shown to be toxic to neurons and to contribute to disease. In
Huntington’s Disease, RNA containing 40 or more CAG repeats is known to associate with
itself, condensing into gel-like assemblies or aggregates. Nevertheless, the stability and
dynamics of the RNA interactions inside these condensates and aggregates are little known. It
is also not known what features of the RNA, if any, correlate with disease propensity. This lack
of progress is in part owing to the difficulty of studying interactions that are repetitive,
heterogeneous, and changeable. This project will develop a new single molecule tool to study
the structures and mechanical properties of abnormal CAG sequences in huntingtin mRNA.
Sensitive optical traps will be used to manipulate and unfold single RNA molecules. Integrated
real-time confocal fluorescence imaging of fluorophore-tagged RNA with microfluidics control of
the reaction components will track the build-up or dissolution of the RNA and protein complexes.
The first aim will determine the structure and stability of normal and expanded RNA and
compare them with the localization, aggregation, and toxicity of huntingtin RNA and protein in
cells. The second aim is to develop a real-time single molecule confocal assay to study the
mechanism of aggregation. The third aim is to develop a method for pulling on natural huntingtin
RNA complexes or aggregates isolated from cells, to understand how these aberrant structures
contribute to pathogenesis. Although this single force-spectroscopy method for studying RNA
aggregation is untried, the results have the potential to provide new information on the
molecular pathology of nucleotide repeat diseases. In the future, our single molecule tools can
be applied to many different RNA repeats and used to test small molecule inhibitors. The long-
term goal of this research is to identify a physical signature of huntingtin mRNA interactions that
predict neurotoxicity and that can be targeted by new therapies."
10813894,"Care and outcomes for the 60,000 very low-birth-weight (VLBW; <1500g) infants born annually in the United
States varies widely. National guidelines recommend that care be organized along hierarchical regionalized care
delivery networks, but too often these vulnerable infants are born in hospitals whose capabilities don't match
patient need. This necessitates postnatal transfer which has been associated with excess morbidity and
mortality. To date, research on regional care networks has been thwarted by a lack of appropriate linked data
sets and mathematical tools to understand care network characteristics and their effect on neonatal outcomes.
We propose to bridge this gap and advance health outcomes science by gaining a deep understanding of
network characteristics and their links to clinical care and outcomes. We will accomplish this by using linked data
sets, not available elsewhere, that allow for analysis of the individual and joint contributions of multi-level factors,
including network factors on clinical outcomes. In addition, we will apply network analysis, a branch of graphical
mathematics to visually display and quantify regionalized care network characteristics. We propose a large, near
population-scale, observational study to analyze routinely collected data from 2010 to 2020 from >290,000 VLBW
infants (>50% of all VLBW infants in the United States) in ~520 NICUs using linked vital records and patient
discharge data from 17 states. This study is designed to achieve 3 specific aims:
1) Quantify regionalization and structure of transfer networks for VLBW infants across the United States;
2) Test the association of network structure with clinical quality of care and outcomes; and
3) Model optimized structure of perinatal transfers networks.
Our analyses will employ network analysis as an innovative tool to measure care regionalization focusing on a
high impact primary outcome (survival without major morbidity), as a substantive departure from prior work.
Machine learning will be used to provide information on optimal network structures in terms of effectiveness,
equity and efficiency. These models will reveal how networks would need to be modified to satisfy optimization
goals and reveal potential trade-offs. We have a long track record of impactful research funded by the National
Institute of Health using this data. We also have an opportunity to investigate more granular questions in
California (140 NICUs), which has unique existing linkages to maternal and infant clinical and transport data. We
expect our research to have an immediate positive impact because it is designed to result in actionable
information for policy makers, administrators and clinicians to improve perinatal care delivery and equity."

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) associated
with ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VF) is responsible for 50% of deaths in patients with structural heart
disease. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is an established therapy for reducing arrhythmic
mortality. Current guidelines for use of primary prevention ICD (i.e., patients without VT/VF history, but at risk)
mainly emphasize left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, only a small percentage of ICD recipients
actually receive appropriate ICD shocks, resulting in unnecessary costs and morbidity. While there is strong
evidence that ICDs reduce mortality in patients with coronary artery disease, the benefit of primary prevention
ICDs in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) is less robust. Furthermore, SCD mostly occurs in
patients with moderate systolic dysfunction who are currently not eligible for an ICD, further highlighting the
limitations of LVEF to choose appropriate ICD candidates. Given the limitations of LVEF, there is a pressing
need for better risk stratification strategies to identify which NICM patients are most likely to benefit from ICD
therapy. Our three specific aims seek to 1) identify the biological basis of cardiac MR (CMR) radiomic
phenotyping of the myocardium by investigating the association between endocardial/epicardial electrograms
(EGM) and CMR radiomic markers; 2) investigate CMR imaging markers that can identify patients with mild to
moderate systolic dysfunction (LVEF of 36% to 50%) at risk of ventricular arrhythmia, who are likely to benefit
from prophylactic ICD therapy and ultimately reduce total SCD burden; and 3) identify NICM patients with LVEF
35% undergoing primary prevention ICD implantation who are less likely to benefit from ICD by developing a
novel risk prediction model integrating CMR markers. Precise identification of individuals who are at risk of SCD
will (a) reduce mortality by offering ICD therapy to patients with mild to moderate systolic dysfunction who are
currently not eligible, and (b) reduce morbidity and healthcare costs in ICD-eligible patients who are at low risk
of SCD and unlikely to obtain a worthwhile benefit."

With the rise of high-throughput sequencing and multiplexed biotechnologies enabling single-cell multi-omics
and massively parallel CRISPR experiments, the biomedical community is generating a monumental amount of
data. These data promise to reveal new biology and drive personal and precision medicine. However, the sheer
volume of genomic data is overwhelming current computational resources, requiring prohibitively high compute
time, memory usage, and storage. My lab has been at the forefront of solving big data challenges in genomics,
designing novel algorithms that enable efficient and secure analyses that were previously computationally
infeasible, and that reveal novel structural, cellular, and systems biology. Drawing upon our expertise in
developing scalable and insightful algorithms for analyzing genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, we aim
to tackle two key data-driven challenges facing the biological community: 1) efficient, accurate, and robust
characterization of tissues at the single-cell level, and 2) translating high-throughput datasets into biological
discoveries via machine learning-based prediction. To solve the first challenge, we will leverage our discovery
that seemingly high-dimensional sequencing data often lies on low-dimensional manifolds that capture the
underlying biological state of interest. We will design algorithms that generate these compact, meaningful
manifold representations of single-cell omics datasets. This will enable a number of key applications including
characterizing co-expression and gene-modules that define healthy and pathologic cell states; integrating
multi-modal single-cell omics datasets to more richly characterize cellular diversity; and investigating the
mechanisms underlying transcriptomic diversity across tissues and developmental states. To solve the second
challenge, we will take a two-pronged approach. First, we will design novel machine learning frameworks that
provide a measure of confidence when predicting in unfamiliar biological states, enabling prediction that is robust
to “out-of-distribution” (unobserved) examples. We will then work with our experimental collaborators and CROs
to rapidly perform experimental validation of model-based predictions. Finally, we will return the experimental
results to the model to further improve performance. This will enable an “active learning” feedback loop to
efficiently explore a complex biological space for outcomes of interest. We will use this uncertainty-powered
active learning approach to explore several pressing biological concerns such as the identification of small
molecule compounds with enzymatic or whole-cell growth inhibitory properties, efficient design of spatial-
transcriptomic experiments, computationally guided CRISPR perturbation experiments, and identification of
functional non-coding mutations. This project will result in 1) numerous software tools with wide utility that
efficiently analyze massive biological datasets and guide complex experimentation, and 2) reveal biological
insights, especially into biomolecular interactions and cellular heterogeneity."

10810661,"Abstract
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the
synovium and infiltration of mononuclear cells into the joint. Once in the joint the mononuclear cells,
predominantly T cells and macrophages, contribute significantly to disease pathology, yet the mechanism by
which these cells enter the joint is not clearly established. To answer this question, we decided to investigate
the expression of chemokine receptors on infiltrating T cells. Chemokine receptors are transmembrane protein
receptors that facilitate immune cell migration towards gradients of their respective cytokines. Previous work in
the lab found a large population of T cells in the inflamed synovium express the chemokine receptor CCR2. In
addition, work from other groups have consistently shown an elevated expression of CCR2 in RA patient
blood, however, there have not been investigations into T cell specific loss of CCR2 in RA. Additionally,
chemokine receptors are often used as markers to identify functional subsets of helper T cells. Considering the
robust population of T cells expressing CCR2 in the inflamed synovium, we hypothesized that CCR2 may
facilitate migration or positioning within the inflamed synovium and may demarcate a functional T cell
population. Furthermore, very little is known about the regulation of CCR2 expression on T cells and better
understanding of its regulation could allow for modulation of the proposed migratory or functional programming.
Therefore, we are proposing a robust investigation into the regulation and function of CCR2 in T cells utilizing
cytometric, transcriptomic, functional, and murine systems to thoroughly characterize this population and better
understand its role in RA pathogenesis."
10897752,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common and morbid metabolic disease that independently predicts development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its cardiovascular, renal and retinal complications. More than one billion individuals have NAFLD, making this the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. A barrier to effectively treating and preventing this disease and its complications is the lack of effective NAFLD treatments. Our long-term goal is to understand the underlying glucose metabolic pathways that lead to NAFLD, so that we can precisely modulate these pathways to treat or prevent its progression. We identified the hepatic carbohydrate carrier, GLUT8, as a therapeutic target because: (i.) GLUT8 promotes diet-induced hepatic steatosis and metabolic syndrome and (ii.) the disaccharide and glucose mimetic trehalose inhibits GLUT8 and activates an adaptive fasting response (e.g. AMP kinase and autophagy), to reverse hepatic steatosis. The objective here is to define the interaction between hepatocyte glucose transport, trehalose, and adaptive hepatocyte fasting responses. Our preliminary data suggest that acute hepatocyte-selective GLUT8 knockdown and hepatocyte- specific germline GLUT8 gene deletion (GLUT8 LKO mice) each induce hepatocyte fasting signals and peripheral thermogenesis. We therefore hypothesize that genetic and pharmacological hepatocyte GLUT8 blockade induces thermogenesis and confers resistance to hepatic steatosis. The two Specific Aims are to 1) Identify mechanisms by which GLUT8 regulates hepatic and extrahepatic metabolism, and 2) Define mechanisms mediating trehalose-induced thermogenesis and protection from NAFLD. We will accomplish these aims by leveraging novel experimental mouse models and unique in vivo imaging techniques. Completing these aims informs how to optimally target hepatocyte glucose transport to augment hepatocyte and whole-organism energy homeostasis."
10816586,"Decision-making for goal-directed actions via reinforcement learning (RL) is a fundamental component of
complex behaviors. Central to RL theory is the balance between exploration and exploitation, which enables
agents to interpret the environment using trial and error to learn an optimal strategy for maximizing reward.
Determining the optimal parameters for when to switch between exploration/exploitation states in RL models has
been difficult, and thus requires new biological insights. Recent work from our lab implicates locus coeruleus
norepinephrine release (LC-NE) in signaling exploration and exploitation states. LC-NE neurons exhibit phasic
activity in an RL task when presented with uncertain stimulus evidence to facilitate task execution/exploration,
and after receiving a surprising reinforcement to facilitate task optimization/exploitation on the next trial. How
these different phasic LC-NE signals are integrated in target regions to modulate different aspects of behavior is
unknown. One possibility is through spatiotemporal integration by astrocytes, which are highly responsive to NE,
are known to be involved in learning and memory, and can modulate neuronal activity on within-trial and
between-trial timescales. Here, we propose that LC-NE release during an RL task causes changes in cortical
network dynamics, facilitated through astrocyte signaling, that enable task execution and optimization. We will
examine the effects of LC-NE and astrocytes on neuronal population dynamics and RL using innovative
approaches combining dual 2-photon imaging of astrocytes and neurons in frontal/prefrontal cortex, high density
neural recordings, optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulation of neurons and astrocytes, and computational
approaches to define the effects of LC-NE and astrocytes on neuronal populations and task encoding. Finally,
we will develop biologically informed computational models of astrocyte-neuron interactions during learned
behavior. In Aim 1, we will record cortical astrocytes and neurons in mice performing our RL task. We will use
high density single-unit recordings and population analyses to determine how population dynamics evolve during
different task epochs. Using this information, we will determine how silencing LC-NE affects astrocyte and neuron
computations and dynamics during RL. In Aim 2, we will use chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations of
astrocyte calcium to determine how astrocyte dynamics contribute to RL behaviors, and how this activity affects
neuronal population dynamics. In Aim 3, we will examine the hypothesis that extending RL algorithms via NE-
astrocyte signals can explain exploration at low stimulus evidence, and that NE-astrocyte interactions across
trials would be reflected in policy gradient learning rules to promote exploitation. Finally, we will determine
whether incorporating NE-astrocyte-neuron interactions into a recurrent neural network model can provide a rich
model for behavior and identify circuit motifs critical to our observed behavioral outcomes. These data will provide
an unprecedented view of the role of NE and astrocytes in a crucial behavioral function, and point to ways by
which their dysfunction can be ameliorated in brain disorders and diseases."

 Effective management of asthma requires regulating airway smooth muscle (ASM) contractility to prevent or
reverse bronchoconstriction. This is primarily achieved by use of direct bronchodilators (e.g., β-agonists), by anti-
inflammatory agents (e.g., corticosteroids) either alone or in combination. However, effective management is
lacking, as an estimated 55% of all asthmatics have suboptimal control. All current bronchodilator drugs have
limitations which respect to efficacy or safety. We propose a novel approach of targeting a mitochondrial protein,
the 18 kDa Translocator Protein (TSPO), as a means of bronchodilation/bronchoprotection. Our central
hypothesis is that potent, efficacious agonists of TSPO can be developed and employed as effective
bronchodilatory/bronchoprotection drugs. Three aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, using in
vitro (primary airway smooth muscle cells; ASM), ex vivo (murine and human rings and precision cut lung slices),
and in vivo models (smTspo-/- mice), we will establish TSPO as a druggable target to promote relaxation of ASM.
In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanistic basis of TSPO regulation of ASM contraction by assessing the roles
of PKA, and mitochondrial Ca2+ and ROS, on signaling events known to regulate cross bridge cycle (regulatory
myosin light chain 20 and myosin phosphatase phosphorylation) or actin polymerization state (F/G actin ratio).
Lastly, in Aim 3 we will employ molecular modeling to design and synthesize new ligands for TSPO, with an
emphasis on generating new drugs that demonstrate superior binding properties and improved efficacy. These
will be tested in cell and tissue model systems employed in Aim 1. The proposed studies represent an innovative
approach to establish an asthma management strategy that overcomes the current limitations of efficacy and
safety. Moreover, the proposed mechanistic studies will provide new insight into how to optimally target the
mitochondria to regulate contractile signaling and function in ASM."

Allergic asthma is one of the most common, chronic airway diseases that often progresses from infancy and
early childhood into adulthood. Current therapies are directed at antagonizing inflammation and bronchial
constriction. Despite their widespread use, these therapies have no beneficial effect on slowing down the
progression of allergic asthma. The central mediator of anamnestic allergic responses is allergen-specific, T
helper 2 resident memory cells (Th2-TRMs). As such, targeting the establishment of allergen-specific, Th2-TRMs
following early life exposure provides an opportunity to modulate and impede progressive allergic asthma.
However, how Th2-TRMs are established in the early lung has never been studied. To address this critical issue
in the pathogenesis of progressive allergic asthma, we have investigated the causal link between allergen
exposure in early life and the long-term effect on airway inflammation. Our study focuses on the communication
between sympathetic nerves and CD4+ T cells in the postnatal, developing lung. So far, our published and
preliminary studies have identified a significant role of nerve-derived dopamine in susceptibility to allergic asthma
in early life and anamnestic allergic responses in adults. We show that dopamine signals through a T cell-specific
DRD4 receptor to promote Th2-TRM phenotypes by activating transcriptional factors and epigenetic modulators
in Th2 cells. Interestingly, sympathetic nerves transition into an adrenergic phenotype with age. Therefore, nerve-
derived dopamine operates in an age-related manner to promote Th2 memory. Given the critical role of dopamine
in the establishment of Th2-TRMs in the early lung, we have investigated the postnatal development of
sympathetic nerves. We found an age-related reduction in the levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that was associated with the dopaminergic-to-adrenergic transition of
sympathetic nerves. Empowered by these preliminary findings, we propose the central hypotheses: dopamine
promotes the establishment of allergen-specific, Th2-TRMs in the early lung; the dopaminergic-to-
adrenergic transition of sympathetic nerves is caused by age-related reduction in NGF and BDNF levels.
These hypotheses will be tested by the following three specific aims. Aim 1 will define the specific role of
dopamine in the abundance and the function of allergen-specific, Th2-TRMs following allergen exposure in early
life. Aim 2 will identify functional mediators of dopamine signaling in Th2-TRM phenotypes. Aim 3 will determine
the role of NGF and BDNF in sympathetic innervation and allergen-specific, Th2-TRMs in the lung. Of note,
clinical studies and GWAS have reported positive correlation between the levels of NGF and BDNF and allergic
asthma. Taken together, our proposed studies will provide insights into the establishment of Th2-TRMs in the
early lung and identify molecular targets for the intervention of progressive asthma from childhood to adulthood."
10887523,"Abstract
 Krabbe’s Disease (KD) is a rare inherited leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the GALC gene
encoding the lysosomal enzyme, galactosylceramidase (GALC). Lack of functional GALC leads to global
demyelination and neurodegeneration. Untreated KD presents in infants as developmental delay and
regression, failure to thrive, and ultimately death by 2-3 years of age. KD is treated with hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation (HSCT) which slows the progression of disease and prolongs life expectancy into the
teenage years, but it is not a cure. Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) have been utilized successfully as gene
therapy treatment vectors in numerous pre-clinical and clinical trials. The initial success of AAV gene therapy in
diseases primarily affecting neuronal cells led to investigations of their efficacy in monogenic diseases affecting
multiple cells types such as KD. The Bongarzone lab previously developed a treatment protocol using AAV9-
GALC to correct the deficiency in the Twitcher murine model of KD. This treatment completely prevented
disease development for the first 6-8 months of life, such that AAV-treated mice were nearly indistinguishable
from wild-type mice. Despite these promising results, our study also revealed a slow decline in treatment
efficacy over time, including development of disease signs and focal demyelinating plaques in mice of
advanced age; similar findings have been noted by other investigators as well. No alternative modifications to
improve gene therapy have been proposed thus far.
 The overarching goal of this application is to establish whether gene therapy efficacy is declining due to
exhaustion of AAV DNA in the adult brain and how to optimize gene therapy treatment efficacy and duration in
Twitcher mice. As AAV-GALC DNA exists as a non-replicating extra-chromosomal episome after entering a
cell, we hypothesize the decline in treatment efficacy is caused by loss of therapeutic vector in replicating cells,
particularly oligodendrocyte precursors, in the Twitcher brain, which leads to a decrease in the average AAV-
GALC episomes per cell over time. This hypothesis will be investigated by treating mice shortly after birth with
AAV9-GALC at decreasing dosages and then observing how long the treatment is efficacious based on clinical
score, survival, as well as biochemical and histological analyses. We will then examine if redosing utilizing
oligodendrocyte targeted AAV (AAV-001) later in life, but prior to disease sign onset, delays or prevents
development of disease signs. Finally, we will determine if utilizing AAV-001 singly will increase the efficacy
and duration of treatment in comparison to AAV9. This study is important because we need to better
understand what happens to episomal AAV DNA long term before attempting to use AAV based therapies to
treat KD patients. Furthermore, our findings will have the intrinsic impact of better characterizing how episomal
AAV DNA behaves in similar monogenic disorders."
10889109,"Decoding the Impact of Sex Differences on Alzheimer’s Disease Risk
The molecular basis and genetic architecture of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) remain poorly defined. Solving these
problems is further complicated by the differences that exist between men and women with respect to the
prevalence, onset, progression and comorbidities of AD, suggesting that some contributing genetic variants are
sex-specific. So far, mixed-gender Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked over 100 loci with AD.
These loci explain much of the population-attributable risk but just a fraction of heritability, and with no distinction
between men and women. It is unlikely that this heritability gap would improve just by splitting studies by sex,
however, since separate analyses on about half as many patients would be less powerful. Rather, in order to
design effective surveillance, screening, preventive, and stratification programs tailored to each sex, there is a
critical need for more sensitive and accurate methods, able to compute the link between genetic variants and
AD risk separately and specifically in men and women. To do so, we propose an integrative computational
approach that will be validated by experimental and translational studies of candidate genes. Rather than seek
individual variants, we focus instead on genes and their coding regions. In order to increase the power of our
studies, we developed an unbiased evolution-based continuous score for the functional impact of any coding
variant, from 0 (neutral) to 1 (complete loss of function). Using this scoring system adds to the usual analyses of
human variants a vast number of amino acid mutation experiments already performed by evolution over billions
of years, with each mutation being tied to a functional readout based on the context of its phylogenetic divergence.
With this score, we now propose to identify genes that carry significantly more impactful coding variants in AD
women, or AD men, compared to sex-matched controls. The gain in statistical power of this approach compared
to GWAS has been demonstrated in preliminary data. In Aim 1 we propose to discover sex-specific AD genes
on more than 1000 Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) men and 1400 ADSP women; and in Aim
2 to discover sex-specific modifiers of APOE. Aim 3 will include validation of computationally-derived candidate
genes in human brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and thorough experimental characterization in AD
animal-models (mouse and Drosophila). Together, this combination of novel, integrative computational
approaches and multi-model systems validation experiments will yield new biomarkers that improve sex-specific
risk stratification of AD status and reveal differences in disease mechanisms between women and men that
highlight potential therapeutic targets specific to each."

Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders including constipation and fecal incontinence are commonly found in patients with
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia. These same disorders are also frequently
encountered in the elderly, raising the possibility that a common process may underlie gut disturbances for both
AD and aging. In humans with AD and AD animal models, amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, one of the disease hallmarks,
have been detected in the enteric nervous system (ENS), an autonomous branch of the peripheral nervous
system that spans the GI tract and regulates gut motility. Aβ gut accumulation appears to cause ENS
neuroinflammation and impaired gut contractility but current literature precludes definitive conclusion. Whether
and how AD involves the gut is of increasing importance given emerging reports that neurodegenerative
disorders are transmitted from the gut to the brain. The proposed multidisciplinary study will integrate the
science of AD with the basic biology of aging. We found that age-related changes to muscularis
macrophages (MMs), a population of tissue-resident macrophages in the ENS, drive geriatric ENS inflammation,
which is associated with disruption of GI motility and impaired cognition. This MM alteration is dependent on
factors in the microbiota and mirrors an AD diseased state found in microglia, the predominant macrophage
population of the brain. Following on these findings, we posit that AD causes MM changes similar to those
seen in geriatric subjects that result in ENS neuroinflammation, altered GI motility and impaired
cognition, and depend on host-microbiota interactions. This hypothesis will be tested with three aims
performed in the APP/PS1 AD mouse model. First, the investigators will evaluate whether AD causes ENS
neuroimmune changes characterized by a MM geriatric disease state (GDS). They will assess whether
alterations in MMs lead to geriatric ENS neuroinflammation with infiltration of immune cells and elevated pro-
inflammatory cytokines, and enteric neuronal loss. Second, the investigators will assess whether disruption in
gut motility precedes impaired cognition. Finally, using experimental manipulation of the microbiota, the
investigators will explore the role of host-microbiota interactions in AD-associated GI disease and their
relationship to cognition. Specifically, the investigators will examine whether and how AD disease progression
is affected by chronic antibiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation of stool from young or old mice, or probiotic
supplementation with Akkermansia mucinophila, a microbiota component reduced in old mice.
Successful completion of the proposed studies will identify critical pathophysiological pathways that affect the
gut and precede cognitive decline. The results will inform novel prevention and intervention strategies for AD
and aging-associated dementia."

The Mechanisms of Parasitism training program has been an ongoing program at the University of Iowa for 24
sequential years. The program unites scientists working on different microbial systems and methods, but
addressing similar questions about “Parasitism”, i.e. the pathogenesis of microbial diseases. Our underlying
hypothesis is that protozoal, helminthic, bacterial, and viral pathogens face similar obstacles in overcoming
mammalian antimicrobial defenses, establishing a niche in which they coexist asymptomatic in their host, or lead
to pathologic conditions (i.e., disease). Our premise is that the mechanisms through which one pathogen evades
killing within the host provides insights into means through which other pathogens survive in their unique host
niche. Most definitely the methods used to investigate host interactions with different hosts overlap. There is a
long history of collaborative research and training among many laboratories at the University of Iowa, and
specifically particularly between members of this Parasitism program. With this new application, we have
expanded our horizons to meet the growing need for collaborative expertise in applying rigorous approaches to
the study of host and pathogen genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, metabolomes, microbiomes, and
phageomes, drawing upon analyses of these massive data sets to generate hypotheses that address the
common and unique mechanisms through which different microbes establish parasitism.
This interdepartmental, interdisciplinary program draws upon faculty members in eight departments and four
interdisciplinary programs with homes in four Colleges (Medicine, Public Health, Engineering, Liberal Arts) at the
University of Iowa. Our activities are aimed at inspiring and enhancing not only training of our students and
postdoctoral scholars, but also enriching the collaborative interactions between faculty members with different
areas of expertise. In this submission, we now add faculty with expertise in Metabolomics, Phylogenetics,
Bioinformatics, and Epidemiology to the faculty. Our current faculty members already have considerable depth
in mechanisms of microbial virulence and host innate and adaptive immune responses. We aim to adopt, and
by default, have our trainees adopt a more comprehensive view of the intricate relationships between host,
microbe, and environment that contributed to parasitism. Our prior trainees have been highly successful; 100%
of those who are done with training have assumed positions in the biomedical sciences or related fields, with
54% holding tenure track university positions and 39% performing research in industry. In this application we
propose an enhanced approach to helping trainees develop their careers. We have been successful at recruiting
minority candidates and propose means to enhance that even further. Overall, we view this as a comprehensive
program to train graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in diverse aspects of parasitism, and to prepare
them for productive careers in education, industry scientific policy or biomedical research."
10916345,"The IsoLation and Loneliness Underlying Misuse and INcreased use of Alcohol as a function of sTress and
coping Efforts (ILLUMINATE) project will test adaptive/maladaptive coping as the mechanisms of action linking
objective social isolation and subjective feelings of loneliness with alcohol use/misuse across the United States
and stress as the moderator of these mediational effects in two separate studies. We will enhance our ability to
test this model in our in-hand self-reported data from Study 1 on loneliness, stress, coping, and alcohol use
during the COVID-19 pandemic when changing executive orders limited social interaction by dint of closures
and reduced capacity. We collected data on a national sample of adults (N=1,550) during the first peak of US
average COVID-19 daily infections in April, 2020 and at five additional points over the subsequent 12 months.
Our surveys collected key self-report data on how people coped in the face of extensive social isolation,
loneliness and concurrent pervasive chronic stress and alcohol consumption. We propose to add geographic
location of the sample participants, which will allow us to create indicators of place-based social isolation and
stressors (including an index of shelter-in-place, restrictions/closing of places of social interaction, and
unemployment rates at each assessment point during COVID) and other stressors specific to a location such
as economic and social vulnerabilities, housing instability, racial and ethnic segregation, and crime rates. Our
first aim is to test adaptive (active coping, reappraisal) and maladaptive (avoidance) coping efforts as the
behavioral mechanism driving alcohol use and high risk drinking over the course of the pandemic, testing the
extent to which these coping processes mediate linkages between social isolation/loneliness and alcohol
use/misuse, and our second aim is to determine whether cumulative-multilevel stress burden (individual and
place-based) moderates the linkages between social isolation, loneliness, adaptive/maladaptive coping, and
alcohol use/misuse. We will then collect prospective data for Study 2 in a nationally representative sample over
6 assessment points (N=1,550), again integrating objective geospatial indicators, to test the model of these
linkages again (Aims 1 and 2) and to determine the extent to which our model of these relationships differed in
a time of enforced isolation and communal stress from a more ordinary time period post-pandemic (Aim 3).
Importantly, the repeated measures design in both samples allows us to model trajectories of alcohol use and
misuse and the complex relationships among social isolation, loneliness, stress, and adaptive/maladaptive
coping processes over time. Closely aligned with the NIH Funding Opportunity Announcement PAR-21-350,
our assessment of the impact of isolation and loneliness in the COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic
periods on alcohol use/misuse has considerable implications for developing prevention and intervention efforts
calibrated for the post-pandemic environment."

Neuroinflammation has emerged as a critical component of secondary injury following brain trauma. Recent pre-
clinical studies have shed light on the neurotoxic effects of peripheral-derived monocyte/macrophages (PDM).
Our preliminary findings suggest this response may be dampened in the presence of juvenile-derived murine
PDMs, however the cause of this neuroprotective response remains unknown. The research objective of this
application is to characterize the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) underlying the divergent, age-dependent
PDM response and their role in mediating neurovascular dysfunction following TBI. Our proposal builds upon
extensive preliminary and published data demonstrating a distinct age-at-injury response following TBI. Juvenile-
derived PDMs display reduced pro-inflammatory phenotype, and adult PDM depletion and replacement with
those from juvenile mice confer neuroprotection. Moreover, we discovered that PDM-specific Tie2/EphA4
receptor crosstalk regulates their pro-inflammatory state across the age spectrum. We hypothesize that age-
related differences in the PDM response underlie divergent outcomes following TBI. We will employ cell-specific
depletions, and PDM replacement as well as novel transgenic murine models. These approaches will include
rigorous behavioral, histological and innovative low-input genome-wide omics assessment of the relevance and
mechanism(s) of PDM age on injury outcomes. We will also provide a framework for retooling the
neuroinflammatory response to accelerate pro-recovery and dampen pro-inflammatory processes after TBI."
10863913,"Project Summary:
 Many people with schizophrenia experience reductions in motivation, which impair occupational
functioning, reduce quality of life, and increase public health demands. Treatments for motivational
impairments in SZ are largely ineffective, however, in part due to poor understanding of etiology. Recent work
has provided strong evidence that abnormal effort-cost decision-making – calculations performed to weigh the
“cost vs. benefits” of actions – may be a key contributor to motivational deficits in schizophrenia. Specifically,
research has shown that people with schizophrenia are less willing than controls to expend effort to obtain
rewards on experimental tasks, and that this deficit is related to motivational impairment. However, due to the
use of imprecise experimental paradigms and analytic methods that are ill-suited to disentangle the
contribution of component processes to effort-cost decision-making, it is unknown whether this reduction is
driven by reduced sensitivity to the rewards or heightened sensitivity to the effort associated with actions. This
knowledge has treatment implications, as interventions for targeting reward and effort sensitivity are different.
 We will use a combination of experimental tasks and associated computational modeling approaches,
to quantify the relative contributions of effort and reward sensitivity to effort-cost decision-making in people with
schizophrenia and healthy controls. We will also collect mobile-based assessments providing comprehensive
phenotyping of motivational impairment experienced in daily life. We aim (a) to determine whether effort-cost
decision-making deficits in schizophrenia reflects increased effort or reduced reward sensitivity, (b) to identify
the neural substrates of effort-cost decision-making impairment, and (c) to establish whether effort measures
correspond to measures of effort and reward in daily life.
 The fact that few researchers have been trained in both clinical phenomenology and computational
modeling techniques limits the translational impact these approaches may have in understanding mental
illness. With this in mind, the training plan is specifically-designed to provide hands-on instruction in 1) applying
computational models to effort-cost decision-making to choice behavior, 2) integrating computational modeling
with functional neuroimaging, and 3) relating computational modeling parameters to mobile-based
assessments of daily motivational experience. Taken together, completion of the proposal will facilitate the
applicant’s long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator examining the computational mechanisms
of motivational impairment in various psychiatric conditions. Further, the data and skills acquired will position
the applicant to competitively submit a transdiagnostic R01 proposal, designed to examine whether effort-cost
decision-making impairments in psychiatric conditions characterized by avolition (e.g., major depressive
disorder, schizophrenia) arise from similar or different computational mechanisms."
10853055,"Phenotyping cells and tissue is a critical function that spans basic science to clinical diagnosis. Yet, established
methods for phenotyping cells in tissue are static, are evaluated when the tissue is dead, and typically involve
destruction of the sample. This paradigm misses an entire dimension represented by cellular function and
activity, information that is potentially of great significance in understanding cell/tissue state. Recently, a new
field has emerged that uses coherence-gated imaging to quantify living tissue motion as a proxy of cellular
function and activity. Coherence-based motility imaging is relatively new - much remains to be learned about the
nature of its dynamic signal. In addition, many of the coherence-gated technologies described to date lack the
resolution to investigate individual cells. The ones that are capable of seeing cells do not provide cross-sectional
images and thus miss important architectural patterns associated with tissue maturation.
We have developed a form of coherence-gated imaging called 1-µm optical coherence tomography (µOCT).
µOCT has a resolution of 1 µm axial by 2 µm lateral, enabling cross-sectional visualization of tissue at the cellular
level. Recently, we have discovered that by sequentially acquiring multiple µOCT images and computing the
pixel-per-pixel power spectrum, we observe a dramatic increase in image contrast and new information emerging
from the µOCT datasets. Preliminary studies with this new technology, termed dynamic µOCT (DµOCT), suggest
that it can be used to visualize epithelial maturation, cell death/apoptosis, and cellular activity. In this grant, we
will mature this technology by conducting key validation studies in a variety of clinically relevant human tissues,
animal models, and spheroids to understand the dynamic signal and determine its accuracy for diagnosing
pathology, activity, and response to therapy (apoptosis/necrosis) (Aim 1). We also will advance DµOCT further
by increasing spatial and temporal resolution, creating new data mining analysis pipelines, and developing and
validating technology and probes that enable DµOCT to be implemented in vivo (Aim 2). By expanding our
understanding and implementation of this exciting technology, we hope to provide a powerful new tool that will
have significant and wide-reaching impact in the biological and clinical sciences."

Project 2 of the Center on Causal Data Science for Child and Adolescent Maltreatment Prevention (CHAMP
Center) will involve proof-of-concept field testing of a decision support tool developed through collaboration
among Project 1, the Resource Core, and the Dissemination & Outreach Core. We will use the findings from
Project 2 to test our overarching hypothesis that predictive and causal data science can substantially increase
the scale at which maltreatment can be prevented and maltreatment-related outcomes can be mitigated.
Effective scalability of appropriate interventions remains a critical obstacle to efforts to reduce child abuse. No
matter the strength of the tools to support implementation or the extent to which the knowledge is shared,
implementation science cannot reduce the incidence of maltreatment if the intervention to be implemented
uniformly targets a small number of causes in all children and families who are at risk. It is thus essential to test
whether tools developed using predictive and causal data science are sufficiently effective and safe to warrant
their dissemination. In Project 2, we will test whether the personalized and precise approaches developed as
part of Project 1 can reduce children’s risk of maltreatment safely and practically. Insights from the conduct of
Project 2 will feed back to Project 1, the Resource Core, and the Dissemination & Outreach Core so that these
groups can learn from the results and iteratively improve on models and translational processes central to the
CHAMP Center. Evidence indicating problems in any of these areas will be considered by relevant members of
the cores, who will decide whether to conduct further discovery research or to refine the tools. Decision support
tools produced via collaboration among Project 1, the Resource Core, and the Dissemination & Outreach Core

Corneal scarring and glaucoma accounts for ocular disability in millions of veterans, active military, and
civilians. Injuries to the eye remain a battlefield and clinical challenge with the potential to severely
reduce vision and quality of life. Ocular trauma and brain injury with resulting visual deficits are major
causes of vision loss among our veterans and troops engaged in Operations Enduring Freedom and
Iraqi Freedom. In addition to acute trauma, aging veterans have a significant increase in age-related
glaucoma compared to the general population. The total cost, including treatment is estimated at 2.4
billion annually for the Armed Services. The link between cornea and glaucoma is that a) almost any
severe eye injury because of the inflammation generated during wound healing and the drugs
administered to treat the inflammation will lead to the onset of glaucoma, and b) the two scarring
indications have similar biological underpinnings and thus it is a cost savings to work on both indications
at the same time. We are proposing the use of a self-delivery siRNA to prevent and reverse scarring in
the cornea and to prevent scarring in the sclera bleb made to reduce intraocular pressure in the eye.
Our self-delivery (modified with cholesterol to gain entry into cells) siRNA modified for in vivo use is
protected with a utility patent to prevent scarring in the eye and a second provisional patent for the
modified self-delivery siRNA sequence and structure.
Acute scarring, similar to chronic fibrosis, is characterized by immune cell infiltration and the persistence
of cells termed myofibroblasts. Pathological myofibroblasts exhibit increased cell adhesion and tissue
contraction through the force generated by binding to the extracellular matrix and the intracellular actin
cytoskeleton via integrins (transmembrane proteins). We have discovered a key point in the healing
pathway that can be therapeutically targeted to control cell apoptosis, immune infiltration, and integrin-
mediated pathological myofibroblast development. Collectively, our studies in primary human corneal
cells, pig corneal organ culture, and in rabbits demonstrate that wounding induces the expression of
the deubiquitinase (DUB), USP10. USP10 removes ubiquitin from both p53 and αv-integrins.
Knockdown of USP10 with one dose of self-delivery siRNA in vivo after corneal wounding significantly
reduced apoptosis, immune infiltration, fibrotic markers, and corneal scarring, and a pilot study
demonstrated regenerative healing in the glaucoma filtration bleb. Towards the goal of realizing the
most effective and specific USP10-targeted therapeutic, in Aim 1, we propose to elucidate the USP10
domains that lead to scarring outcomes and the effect of USP10 binding partner, G3BP2 on USP10
DUB activity. In Aim 2, we will expand our studies on USP10 knockdown to determine if corneal
inflammation and scarring can be totally prevented with a second dose of self-delivery siRNA and
reversed by novel techniques to permit siRNA entry into a scar. In Aim 3, we will test if USP10
knockdown can prevent inflammation and scarring in the bleb after glaucoma surgery that is performed
to relieve intraocular pressure elevation associated with glaucoma. Successful completion of these
Aims will significantly improve our understanding of the central mechanisms that promote scarring, and
will lead to the development of novel self-delivery siRNA approaches to preventing corneal and
glaucoma-related blindness in the veteran and civilian populations."
10881720,"Patients served by the Veterans Health Administration who have chronic cardiopulmonary conditions are at high
risk for death because of pulmonary hypertension (PH). A particularly dangerous form of PH, referred to as
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), is a vascular disease with high prevalence and poor survival among US
veterans. PAH is characterized by gene variants, chronic inflammation and an occlusive remodeling of the
vascular intima (neointima). Heterozygous germline mutations in BMPR2 (bone morphogenetic protein receptor
2) is the principle genetic risk factor for hereditary PAH. There is an unmet need to understand how
environmental cues induce PAH in otherwise healthy BMPR2 mutation carriers.
We recently showed in a new ‘2-hit’ rat model that Bmpr2 mutations, when coupled with pulmonary inflammation,
elicit severe PAH in otherwise phenotypically-silent Bmpr2+/- mutant rats. PAH in this model features a
proliferative and inflammatory neointima with characteristics shared by human disease. TGF-b blockade
ameliorates advanced PAH and neointimal transformation in Bmpr2+/- animals and is a promising clinical therapy.
Pilot single cell RNA-seq analyses of the disease rat lungs revealed that Bmpr2 mutations and an inflamed lung
microenvironment cause a ‘transcriptional convergence’ of endothelial cells (ECs, originating from pulmonary
arteries, arterioles and capillaries) to form the transformed neointima. Based on these results, we postulate
that PAH occurs in Bmpr2 mutants because discrete endothelial transcriptional programs are modulated
and result in an inflamed neointima.
This proposal explores how genetic and environmental triggers may lead to neointimal formation and PAH at the
cellular and molecular levels; proposed studies also search for druggable targets driving EC transformation
following TGF-b treatment. Specific Aim 1 evaluates how Bmpr2 deficiency causes transcriptional
convergence of ECs to form the PAH neointima and has three subaims which are to establish a molecular
atlas of rat lungs in health and PAH using cutting-edge single molecular techniques (Aim 1a), then to elucidate
the cellular origins of neointima by tracking specific endothelial lineage cells in evolving disease (Aim 1b), and
finally to identify molecular programs responsible for the formation and maintenance of vascular lesions (Aim
1c). Specific Aim 2 explores how BMPR2 deficiency in human pulmonary arterial ECs provokes
proliferative endothelial inflammation and focuses on the influence of BMPR2 deficiency on inflammatory 5-
lipoxygenase (5-LO), NF-kB and IL-6 signaling. Here, the mechanisms by which BMPR2 insufficiency induces
5-LO epigenetic and post-translational modification, NF-kB transcriptional activities and classical- or trans-IL-6
signaling will be assessed. Specific Aim 3 tests whether TGF-b blockade reverses PAH by eliminating
transcriptionally-convergent ECs (i.e., neointimal cells) in the lungs of Bmpr2 mutant rats. This aim
investigates whether and how TGF-b inhibition reverses PAH by promoting the transcriptional ‘deconvergence’
of ECs and explores the reversibility and potential druggability of molecular targets. The overarching goal of this
proposal is to create a better understanding about the formation of the neointimal layer in PAH, a pathological
process responsible for vascular occlusion, high pulmonary artery pressures and right heart failure. These
studies may also offer clear directions for future therapeutic avenues of direct benefit to our veteran patients."

Although circadian rhythms are established as a fundamental mechanism in various biologic processes,
including metabolic and cardiovascular functioning, less is known regarding how disruption of circadian
rhythms may contribute to development of cardiometabolic disease in broader human populations. Prior
epidemiologic studies have predominantly focused on specific populations who experience extreme circadian
disruption, such as rotating night shift workers. In this application, we will consider irregular sleep schedules as
a ubiquitous marker of chronic circadian disruption and evaluate its role in cardiometabolic disease
development. First, we will leverage the wealth of data from the UK Biobank (UKB), which has measured
habitual sleep using accelerometer among 92,644 participants. We will characterize the dose-response
relationships of irregular sleep schedules with risk of hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease and
identify potential threshold to define what level of sleep variability may be cardiometabolically unhealthy. We
will also evaluate whether the observed associations differed by sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, sex,
race/ethnicity) or other sleep traits (e.g., average sleep duration and insomnia symptoms). Further, given that
sleep regularity represents a highly modifiable risk factor, we will evaluate whether regular sleep schedules
may counteract genetic predisposition to cardiometabolic disease. Second, in the Nurses’ Health Study 3
(NHS3), we propose to measure habitual sleep using Fitbit and plasma metabolomics among 1,000 nurses,
encompassing a wide range of variations in sleep schedules (including a random subset with night shift work).
We hypothesize that irregular sleep schedules are associated with altered metabolites exhibiting circadian
rhythms, such as omega-3 fatty acids, linoleate, arginine and tyrosine. We further hypothesize that this
metabolic profile mediates the associations between irregular sleep and cardiometabolic traits including
obesity, blood pressure and heart rate variability. In addition, we will collect new data on several emerging risk
factors for irregular sleep that have not been examined in previous work, including mobile device use, late
eating, breakfast skipping, pet ownership and childbearing/rearing in women. To increase rigor, reproducibility
and generalizability, we will confirm our primary findings from UKB and NHS3 in the diverse Multi-Ethnic Study
of Atherosclerosis (n=2,156), which have existing data on objectively measured habitual sleep, genomics,
metabolomics and conventional epidemiologic risk factors. Overall, this project will provide larger-scale, more
diverse and more in-depth evidence for the cardiometabolic impact of irregular sleep schedules in US and
European populations, elucidate underlying biologic mechanisms, and ultimately foster development of
potential public health recommendations and interventions to reduce irregular sleep and improve
cardiometabolic health."

 HIV remains one of the world’s most devastating diseases, with more than 38 million people living with HIV
(PLWH) and an additional 1.7 million new infections per year. Moreover, in 2019, infection with malaria was
reported to have reached 229 million cases worldwide and caused over 409,000 deaths. Although advances
have been made in reducing the incidence of both HIV and malaria, the risk of infection with either disease is
still great, especially in resource-limited countries. Importantly, the geographical overlap in endemic HIV and
malaria constitutes a high risk for co-infection, fueling transmission and pathogenesis of both diseases. The
burdens of HIV and malaria are particularly elevated in pregnant women, leading to increased risk of poor birth
outcomes and maternal and infant mortality. Notably, malaria in pregnancy (MIP) in women living with HIV (WLH)
results in even greater risk of adverse outcomes and the treatments currently available for MIP have only shown
limited success in WLH. Therefore, our long-term goal is to identify key factors in MIP immunopathogenesis to
aid in development of new therapeutics that can safely and effectively reduce maternal and fetal morbidity and
mortality in WLH. The overall objectives for this application are to (1) dissect the pathogenic outcomes of P.
fragile infection in SIV+ pregnant rhesus macaques (RMs) and (2) mechanistically elucidate the role of
neutrophils and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in decidual inflammation during SIV/P. fragile co-infection. Our
central hypothesis is that P. fragile and SIV co-infection of pregnant RMs will result in greater placental
parasitemia and dysfunction that associates with higher levels of decidual neutrophil accumulation and ILC
activation, as compared to mono-infected or healthy RMs. The rationale for the proposed research is that a better
understanding of the complex interplay of neutrophils and ILCs in placental dysfunction will promote subsequent,
targeted studies to leverage our findings to develop novel interventions to treat MIP in WLH. The central
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) To identify key pathogenic consequences of P.
fragile infection and the impact of SIV co-infection during pregnancy; 2) To define the role of neutrophils in
peripheral and decidual inflammation during co-infection of pregnant RMs; and 3) To determine the role of ILCs
in regulating peripheral and decidual inflammation in co-infected pregnant RMs. The proposed research is
innovative because it focuses on using a highly translational animal model to open new scientific horizons on
key alterations in innate immune function that drive poor maternal and fetal outcomes in SIV and P. fragile co-
infection, which closely parallels the dynamics of HIV and P. falciparum infection. The proposed research is
significant because it is expected to provide a strong, evidence-based foundation for future pre-clinical studies
of the biological mechanisms of MIP in WLH. Ultimately, these studies will provide new opportunities to develop
therapies and prevention strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality due to malaria in highly vulnerable WLH."
10868602,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiometabolic disease (CMD), including diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), represents an
enormous public health burden. Although a large number of clinical risk factors and molecular biomarkers are
known to contribute to CMD risk at the population level, individual-level risk prediction remains challenging and
there is an unmet need to identify individuals during earlier, and thus more modifiable, subclinical stages in the
development of CMD. The systemic response to discrete physiologic perturbations (or ‘stresses’) can unmask
abnormal metabolic and homeostatic functions that are not apparent in a resting state. Therefore, we propose
to systematically assess responses to an oral mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT), which represents a
standardized, reproducible, and physiologic metabolic challenge. Preservation of energy balance and efficient
storage of fuel substrates after a meal requires a coordinated multi-organ systemic response. Subclinical organ
system dysfunction can alter post-meal metabolism leading to distinct circulating metabolic signatures. In this
application, we will capture integrated responses to a MMTT by assaying dynamic changes (from fasting to 2
hours post-prandial) in ≈600 circulating small molecules providing broad coverage of the human metabolome.
Fasting metabolite profiles are associated with key CMD risk factors and events, but how intra-individual
changes in these metabolites after a meal reflect subtle differences in metabolic health is largely unknown.
Accordingly, we hypothesize that the metabolic response to a MMTT can reveal cardiometabolic dysfunction
that is not evident by fasting blood measures. To test this hypothesis, we will characterize MMTT responses in
3037 Framingham Heart Study (FHS) participants at the fourth exam of the Generation 3/ Omni 2 cohorts. Our
specific aims are: (1) to characterize metabolomic responses to a MMTT and their relations to CM traits and
insulin resistance; (2) to relate post-MMTT metabolite responses (and baseline levels of metabolites with large
post-meal excursions) to cardiometabolic and CVD and outcomes in the FHS and in the Coronary Artery Risk
Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study; (3) to assess molecular determinants of post-MMTT metabolite
responses including genetic variation, antecedent metabolite trajectories, and the gut microbiome composition.
Our application will systematically evaluate metabolic responses to a MMTT in the community with the goals of
identifying abnormal responses not accessible by standard fasting measures that provide innovative insights
regarding future CMD risk and of discovering novel biological pathways that may be amenable to drug
modulation. Our study team includes experts in the fields of epidemiology, metabolomics, diabetes, high-
dimensional molecular assays and data analysis, and bioinformatics. By systematically assessing metabolic
responses to a standardized oral meal in community-dwelling individuals with varying cardiovascular risk
profiles, we will provide an important resource to the scientific community."

Brain capillary Piezo1 ion channels and blood flow regulation in Alzheimer’s Disease
Brain capillaries are the smallest blood vessels in the brain and are crucial in sensing the metabolic needs of
active neurons and responding to these needs by supplying more blood. Notably, this function is impaired during
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. Not only that capillary sensing is impaired during
Alzheimer’s disease, vascular stiffness and complete disruption of capillary blood flow, referred to as capillary
stalling, have been observed in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. Given that capillary stalling disrupts the
hemodynamic forces that capillaries are exposed to, it is important to understand whether Alzheimer’s disease
associates with altered mechano-sensing abilities. We recently discovered that the protein Piezo1 is a
mechanosensor in brain capillaries. Here, we test the overall hypothesis that altered Piezo1 channel activity is
involved in the reduction of brain blood flow in Alzheimer’s disease. We further speculate that tuning Piezo1
activity will improve cerebral blood flow. We will investigate the contribution of endothelial Piezo1 channels to
capillary stalling and blood flow reductions in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Using capillary endothelial
cells from wild-type and Alzheimer’s disease mice, we will employ innovative electrophysiological and molecular
approaches to assess whether Piezo1 ion channel expression and function are altered during Alzheimer’s
disease. In the second aim, we will utilize in vivo high-resolution, two-photon microscopy to investigate capillary
stalling and blood flow changes in Alzheimer’s disease mice while pharmacologically manipulating Piezo1
channels. This novel work could lead to new therapeutic strategies not previously tested."
10864999,"Project Summary/Abstract
There is a critical need to translate retinal ganglion cell (RGC) therapies from lab to clinic, particularly cell
transplant therapies to repair degenerated eye tissues and restore visual function. RGC transplant has great
potential in treating degenerative retinal and optic nerve diseases, but key pre-clinical studies are hampered by
an inability to track transplanted cells. In this project, the candidate proposes to advance RGC transplant in
treating glaucoma through longitudinal and non-invasive tracking of RGCs with the aid of nanoparticle-based
optical coherence tomography (OCT) contrast agents. These nanoparticles are to be customized to label and
visualize RGCs with a high spatial resolution. Longitudinal tracking of the RGCs in vivo could uncover the fate
of the donor RGCs, increase our understanding of their behavior in the eye, and identify the factors that affect
the treatment efficacy of RGC transplants. In this application, the PI first proposes to use spectral OCT signals
of gold nanorods (GNRs) to maximize the contrast between donor RGCs and the retina in OCT imaging. Second,
the PI proposes to examine the correlation between the OCT signals of GNRs and the fate of donor RGCs with
both in vitro and in vivo assays. Third, the PI proposes to test the effects of cell number and injection location on
the transplant success rate, and to leverage advanced imaging to optimize RGC transplantation. Overall,
investigations in GNR-based OCT contrast agents for in vivo RGC tracking will gain us essential knowledge in
the efficacy of RGC transplant and advance RGC transplant for glaucoma treatment. These data will contribute
to the PI’s overall career goals, to investigate biomaterials that could track, support, and control therapeutic cells
in vivo and to use these biomaterials to provide novel methods to treat otherwise incurable diseases. During the
mentored phase of this award, the candidate will prioritize undertaking activities to increase understanding and
gain hands-on training in the areas of OCT and glaucoma in the Department of Ophthalmology at Stanford, with
support from the world-class Molecular Imaging Program and the outstanding Materials Science & Engineering
Community at Stanford, and with the benefits of a close-knit and focused department and the multi-
interdisciplinary collaborations and resources of the more comprehensive university."
10929345,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY
Nicotine is the most important driver of tobacco use. The tobacco industry's manipulation of nicotine in cigarettes
and smokeless tobacco led to products that were more addictive, abused, and deadly. With “starter” products
for young people and nicotine-naïve users and “mature” products for established tobacco users, the industry has
historically manipulated the “levers” of nicotine concentration and form to increase tobacco use across all
demographics. E-cigarettes (ECs) and more recently oral nicotine pouches (ONPs) vary these nicotine
dimensions signaling that the industry is again following this profit-driven strategy. Recent advancements in
nicotine synthesis also makes nicotine isomer a new product lever that the industry can adjust to drive consumer
uptake through changes in pharmacokinetics and misleading marketing claims. While the US Congress and FDA
have imposed important regulations to dissuade tobacco use among young people, we argue that the regulation
of nicotine itself may be the most effective strategy to achieve optimal population health. Like the tobacco
industry, the FDA can pull these same levers via product standards and marketing regulations to adjust the
appeal and addiction potential of ECs and ONPs. Through our integrative theme, “Flipping the Script”: Using
the Industry's Nicotine Playbook to Maximize Public Health, the Ohio State University Tobacco Center of
Regulatory Science (OSU-TCORS) will be guided by the industry's Consumer Response Model to understand
how nicotine in ECs and ONPs are impacting product appeal, addictiveness, use patterns, and toxicity. We posit
that regulation of nicotine's three dimensions can dissuade young people, including non-users, from using ECs
and ONPs but still provide a satisfying and less harmful alternative for adult tobacco users for complete switching.
Project 1 (P1) and P2 will examine the influence of EC and ONP nicotine manipulations on product appeal,
abuse liability, use, and toxicity; P3, using ONPs as an exemplar product, will examine the influence of nicotine
marketing claims on appeal and product trial; and P4 will examine how young people, including priority
populations, respond to both nicotine product marketing and design characteristics in the natural environment.
The projects are supported by the Market Monitoring Core that will provide critical real-time marketing and
purchasing of products by venue and the Product Evaluation and Manipulation Core that studies products
varied by nicotine dimensions with chemical and toxicological analysis. They also will be supported by the
Administrative Core. The Career Enhancement Core will foster the training of students, postdoctoral fellows,
and early career investigators in tobacco regulatory science. Together, the OSU-TCORS addresses the FDA
priority scientific domains of Product Composition and Design, Toxicity, Addiction, Health Effects, Behavior, and
Marketing Influences. The projects are highly integrated and will provide the FDA with critical, first-of-its-kind
data by conducting complementary interventional and observational studies to inform the Consumer Response
Model as a tool to protect public health."
10929352,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 1
Historically, the tobacco industry manipulated nicotine in cigarettes to promote smoking. They are now following
the same playbook for e-cigarettes (ECs), manipulating the nicotine dimensions of concentration and form,
and more recently have begun manipulating isomer composition through the use of synthetic nicotine. These
manipulations have led to ECs with increased palatability and nicotine delivery, maximizing their appeal and
addictiveness, particularly to young people. While ECs may be a less harmful alternative for smokers who
completely switch, EC uptake, use, and addiction among young people is alarming.The overall integrative theme
of The Ohio State University Tobacco Center for Regulatory Science is: “Flipping the Script”: Using the
Industry's Nicotine Playbook to Maximize Public Health. J
ust as the tobacco industry manipulates nicotine
to create ECs that appeal to young people, we posit that the FDA,
through nicotine regulation, can make products
unappealing to young people while still providing smokers with a less harmful alternative with sufficient appeal
and satisfaction. To test this hypothesis, Project 1 (P1)
will examine the unique and combined effects of nicotine
form, concentration, and isomer on EC product appeal, abuse liability, use patterns, and toxicity (Study 1), and
determine if an EC product standard requiring a minimum level of free-base (FB) nicotine (nicotine form) would
reduce the appeal of ECs for young adults but not older adult smokers (Study 2). In Study 1, using a double-
young adult (21-24 years) exclusive EC users with no/minimal history of smoking and
older adult cigarette smokers will vape 8 lab-prepared, tobacco-flavored liquids varied by nicotine
dimensions. Outcomes will include subjective effects, nicotine pharmacokinetics, and puffing topography.
blind crossover design,
(25 years)
To
assess the toxicological effects of varying EC nicotine dimensions, topography data will be used in puff-playback
toxicology studies with in vitro air-liquid interface exposures for cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory disease
surrogate markers. Nicotine isomers may have different metabolic routes and rates, so we will also examine
nicotine metabolism rate. In Study 2,
young adult exclusive EC users with minimal/no history of smoking and
older adult smokers will complete a single-visit, double-blind, randomized crossover trial to vape e-liquids at 2
nicotine concentrations and 2 isomer ratios, with varying FB nicotine fractions to assess outcomes of appeal.
P1
is significant and innovative because it will be the first to systematically examine the impact of nicotine
dimensions (including isomer composition) on EC abuse liability, compare pharmacological, toxicological, and
metabolic profiles of nicotine isomers in humans, and determine whether regulations limiting FB nicotine fraction
in EC liquids are appropriate for the protection of public health.
Integrated with P3-4, results will also inform
marketing and product regulations that reduce appeal and dissuade EC use in youth and non-users but not adult
tobacco users. P1 will address the FDA scientific domains of
Product Composition and Design, Addiction,
Toxicity, Health Effects, and Behavior."
10875463,"Significant disparities in pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention exist in the U.S. with cisgender
women making up a disproportionately low percentage of PrEP users compared to men. 60% of new HIV
diagnoses among women are among Black women, the majority of whom reside in the South. Challenges exist
at each step of the PrEP care continuum, including difficulty identifying cisgender women at highest risk for HIV
who are most likely to benefit from PrEP, low self-perception of HIV risk, low levels of PrEP knowledge, and
barriers to PrEP initiation and persistence. While there has been growing knowledge of interventions to
increase PrEP use among men who have sex with men and transgender women, much less is known about
successful strategies to increase uptake and support PrEP persistence among Black cisgender women.
Through preliminary work, our team has identified a set of successful strategies for PrEP Optimization among
Women to Enhance Retention and Uptake (POWER Up) in community health center (CHC) settings,
consisting of routine PrEP education for Black cisgender women, standardized provider training, electronic
medical record tools for identifying women who would benefit from PrEP and tracking PrEP outcomes, and
PrEP navigation. With These POWER Up strategies, a CHC network in the Midwest has more than doubled
PrEP uptake among Black cisgender women and maintained PrEP persistence rates above the national
average. These strategies have not been studied in CHCs with a large population of Black cisgender women
outside of the Midwest. Therefore, we propose to refine, implement, and evaluate the impact of a CHC-focused
intervention to improve PrEP care continuum outcomes for Black cisgender women in the Southern US, using
implementation science research methods.
Guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation and Sustainment (EPIS) implementation science
framework, we will undertake the following aims: 1) Preparation: Adapt previously identified successful
implementation strategies for engaging Black cisgender women in the PrEP care continuum in a Midwestern
CHC for use in Southern CHCs. 2) Implementation: Via a hybrid type II design using the RE-AIM framework,
measure the implementation and effectiveness outcomes of the adapted interventions in the Southern United
States compared to the approach in the Midwest. We will complete a stepped wedge randomized controlled
trial in 16 CHCs in the Midwest and South. 3) Sustainment and Spread: Develop an implementation guide
that can be utilized across Southern U.S. jurisdictions to improve PrEP care continuum engagement among
Black cisgender women reflecting the knowledge gained through adaptation. This will allow for rapid
dissemination and replication of these strategies to improve PrEP care continuum outcomes among Black
cisgender women."

Franciscan Healthcare - Southeast Wisconsin, Inc., Columbia St. Mary’s, Inc., and Ministry Health Care, Inc.
(Ascension Wisconsin (AW)), and Aspirus, Inc. (Aspirus). With SVHCC as the project/performance primary
site, the three main institutions and their cooperating affiliates provide access to National Cancer Institute
(NCI)-sponsored clinical trials to community members throughout Wisconsin and northern Michigan. The
consortium covers an extensive catchment area that includes both rural and urban counties, as well as minority
and underserved communities. The CROWN Consortium looks to broaden recruitment capabilities, regularly
share best practices through established consortium committees, reach a more diversified patient portfolio, and
implement cancer care delivery research (CCDR) at multiple affiliate locations. In addition, the consortium will
actively participate and engage in NCORP Research Base trials beyond accrual by serving on committees,
contributing to protocol development, and developing young investigators to be engaged with clinical research.
The CROWN Consortium brings together an experienced research infrastructure with a multidisciplinary team
of qualified investigators across many areas of clinical research including medical and radiation oncology,
palliative care and pediatric oncology. The consortium provides a vast portfolio of cancer control, prevention,
and care delivery, biospecimen, screening/post-treatment surveillance trials, as well as treatment and imaging
clinical studies to the community setting. As a result, the CROWN Consortium will address gaps in clinical
research in rural, urban, minority, and underserved populations. The CROWN Consortium will address this by
the following specific aims: 1) Broaden CROWN Consortium participation in NCI-sponsored clinical trials by
expanding recruitment, clinical capabilities, and sharing of resources; 2) Expand recruitment and retention of
urban, rural, racial and ethnic minorities, and other underrepresented patient populations; 3) Execute high-
quality Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) throughout the CROWN Consortium; and 4) Increase
investigator engagement in NCORP initiatives by contributing to best practices and research findings.
The CROWN Consortium represents a proven, high-performing addition to the NCORP network. The
consortium will expand NCORP’s access to populations in Wisconsin and northern Michigan. The consortium
will further NCORP Research Bases’ programs by providing a more representative population for studies, and
by providing feedback on study design feasibility for community sites and for appropriateness for diverse
participants. CROWN Consortium’s emphasis on understudied subgroups further underscores the value of
CROWN Consortium to the NCORP network."
10846646,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Organization is a fundamental and defining feature of life at all degrees of scale, from the subcellular
level all the way up to the level of the organism. On the cellular level, molecules and organelles must be situated
with appropriate temporal and spatial precision such that processes may proceed according to the needs of the
cell. Similarly, cells are arranged into appropriate layers to define underlying tissue organization, which provides
the basis for organ function, and to support health of the organism. Major determinants of subcellular and cellular
organization are molecular motors that transport diverse cargoes throughout the cellular environment. One such
motor is cytoplasmic dynein, which transports numerous types of cargoes along microtubule tracks during all cell
cycle stages, and within many cell types. For instance, dynein is the major retrograde microtubule motor that
transports many vesicular and protein cargoes toward the cell body of neurons. In addition to orchestrating
appropriate subcellular organization, dynein plays a major role in the establishment and maintenance of tissue
architecture. For instance, a major determinant of cell fate and consequent tissue organization is the orientation
and position of the mitotic spindle with respect to the boundaries of the cell. In addition to localizing to the
membrane of small vesicular cargoes – from where it effects their transport – dynein motors are anchored at
the plasma membrane from where they orient and position the spindle through precisely tuned interactions with
microtubules. During such processes as organismal development and tissue homeostasis, spindle orientation
and position dictate the plane of cell division, and thus whether a cell divides symmetrically or asymmetrically.
Symmetric stem cell divisions result in two identical stem cells, whereas a switch to asymmetric division results
in one stem cell and a differentiated cell, which promotes tissue stratification. Thus, dynein is a critically important
molecule that dictates biological organization on many levels of scale. The precise mechanisms by which dynein
performs all these disparate functions with appropriate spatial and temporal control are unclear. The lack of such
information presents an impediment towards the development of effective therapies that may prevent or reverse
defects in cellular and tissue organization that can lead to various devastating disorders (e.g., malformations of
cortical development, motor neuron diseases). In the proposed studies, we will use a combination of in vitro and
cell biological approaches to determine the mechanisms by which dynein is regulated to perform its cargo
transport functions. Specifically, we will: (1) resolve the mechanism by which the lissencephaly-related protein
LIS1 initiates dynein-mediated cargo transport; (2) determine how dynein effects spindle movements with precise
directional precision; (3) determine how, and the molecular basis by which various critical regulators affect dynein
activity; and, (4) investigate the coordination and interplay between cell cycle state and dynein activity. Our
studies will provide critical insight into fundamental mechanisms that dictate transport of numerous cargoes with
spatial and temporal precision such that cellular and ultimately organismal health is established and maintained."
10895482,"Racial/ethnic minority adults are at higher risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
(ADRD). Moreover, minority adults are not only exposed to more intense and frequent stressful
situations in their daily lives but they also have fewer resources to manage these situations in
healthy ways. Limited resources among these adults may lead to impaired physiologic stress
responses (i.e., stress reactivity), specifically dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system
and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. Our understanding of the impact of
stress reactivity on ADRD risk comes from animal studies and experiments in humans using
controlled, laboratory stressors. This is a major limitation because laboratory stressors cannot
capture the variety, severity, or duration of stressors that individuals face in their daily lives.
Thus, there remains a need to more rigorously evaluate relationships of stress reactivity with
ADRD risk in natural settings. We propose to fill this critical gap in the literature by adding more
personalized and objective indicators of stress and stress reactivity to a longstanding
community-based cohort, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). We will use existing
gene expression data to calculate a molecular marker of the physiologic response to chronic
exposure to adversity. We will also collect repeated measurements of stressful experiences,
negative affect (emotions), and heart rate in order to develop participant-specific markers of
affective and autonomic stress reactivity, respectively. Our overall goal is to use these
measures to examine associations of the body's response to stressful experiences with risk of
ADRD in a natural setting. We will leverage existing and ongoing repeated assessments of
cognitive function as well as ongoing assessments of neuroimaging biomarkers of both vascular
and AD pathology including cerebral blood flow (CBF), white matter hyperintensities, Aβ
deposition, and gray matter volume loss. Our proposed study will allow us to begin to
disentangle the pathways through which stress exposure and stress reactivity impact vascular
dementia pathology and/or AD positivity. Findings will inform stress management interventions
and precision medicine initiatives designed to prevent ADRD and/or slow its progression."
10916438,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The Outreach, Recruitment, and Engagement Core (OREC) will be responsible for providing important
liaison and outreach between the Cleveland Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (CADRC) and people with
dementia, their care partners and both the professional and local lay community, so that information may be
communicated bi-directionally. The OREC will be led by Dr. Martha Sajatovic, a clinical investigator with over 2
decades of clinical trials and research experience, with focus on community outreach and engagement of
traditionally hard-to-reach or marginalized populations. To best meet the needs of the Center, the OREC must
develop and maintain a robust pool of volunteers within Northeast Ohio, with and without cognitive impairment,
who are willing to participate in the CADRC Clinical Core (CC) and other activities (e.g., clinical trials). The OREC
will accomplish this through 4 specific aims.
 The OREC will promote recruitment and retention of participants in clinical research in close collaboration
with the CC (Specific Aim 1). Both cores will continuously coordinate and evaluate recruitment and outreach
efforts to identify the most effective strategies, develop new recruitment methods, and build even more extensive
collaboration with community stakeholders and an expanded referral network. In Specific Aim 2, the OREC will
focus recruitment of key subgroups, including African-Americans (AA), individuals with dementia with Lewy
bodies and atypical Alzheimer's disease (AD), and cognitively normal controls. Taken together, these special
populations will provide valuable new data on asymptomatic, at-risk individuals, and individuals in the earliest
stages of neurocognitive decline. The OREC will leverage the existing Minority Advisory Board (MAB) to raise
awareness of the CADRC within the AA community. Recruitment of other sub-groups will build upon successful
funded programs to recruit from existing subject samples. Another goal of the OREC is to promote community
education and communication, disseminate research findings, and obtain feedback that will continue to improve
the academic-community partnership by engaging both the lay community as well as local and regional
professional groups (Specific Aim 3). The OREC will aim to support all other members of the CADRC cores as
it relates to linkage between the OREC and other cores. The OREC will facilitate communication between all
cores, optimize outreach activities and help ensure that all cores are actively collaborating in the central goal of
advancing AD research (Specific Aim 4)."

Within the Massachusetts AI and Technology Center for Connected Care in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease
(MAITC), the activities of the Technology Identification and Training Core will play a critical role in ensuring that
the Center invests in innovative technologies with the greatest potential to address the most critical needs of
patients, lay caregivers, and clinicians in supporting healthy aging and AD/ADRD care. In addition, this core
will make significant contributions to educating a new generation of investigators capable of bridging the gap
between AI-enhanced technology and aging and AD/ADRD care.
To achieve these objectives, the Technology Identification and Training Core will pursue four aims. First, the
Technology Identification and Training Core will conduct a rigorous, two-part technology identification process
that determines what emerging AI-enhanced technologies have the potential to address the needs of
stakeholders (i.e., older adults, lay caregivers, and clinicians) and performs initial technology assessments with
these stakeholders to determine if the technologies are suitable for incorporation into pilot studies. Second, the
Technology Identification and Training Core will assist investigators in selecting the most appropriate AI-
enhanced technologies and in optimizing their deployment in pilot projects. The Technology Identification and
Training Core will also help pilot project investigators maximize the impact of their research by identifying open
areas for the development of new technologies. Third, the Technology Identification and Training Core will
provide training to technology developers, clinicians, and other stakeholders about the potential of available
and emerging AI-enhanced technologies to support Healthy Aging and AD/ADRD care. Fourth, the Technology
Identification and Training Core will support, in coordination with other cores, a plan to broadly disseminate
MIATC findings that includes issuing whitepapers describing the findings produced by the technology
identification process, building and maintaining an online community of individuals interested in the work of the
MIATC, and organizing multidisciplinary workshops at major technology conferences. We expect the work of
the Technology Identification and Training Core to contribute to an innovative high-impact pilot project program
that will positively affect stakeholders, technologists, clinicians, and industry partners."

and feasibility-testing of AI-enhanced technologies.
To achieve these objectives, the Clinical Translation and Validation Core will pursue the following three aims.
First, it will provide a streamlined validation pipeline for taking promising AI-enhanced technologies from
benchtop to real-world deployment to enable at-home use for older adults and patients with AD/ADRD. To
accomplish this, the Clinical Translation and Validation Core will leverage state-of-art facilities for technology
validation at the UMass Amherst Institute of Applied Life Sciences (IALS) and the Northeastern Consortium on

teams the opportunity to recruit participants in both urban and rural settings across Eastern and Western
Massachusetts. The Clinical Translation and Validation Core will leverage longitudinal study cohorts already
engaged with the Massachusetts Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC) and the Harvard Brain
Study (HABS), and ad-hoc cohorts at the Brandeis and Brigham Women’s Hospital Roybal Centers and
UMass IALS. Second, the Clinical Translation and Validation Core will support the pilot project process by
contributing to defining the call for proposals by suggesting AI-enhanced technologies that are suitable for
validation by leveraging MIATC resources (in coordination with the Technology Identification and Training
Core). It will also provide input regarding the selection of pilots based on technical, usability, and feasibility
criteria and offer consulting services and technical support to enhance likelihood of pilot project success. Third,
the Clinical Translation and Validation Core will maintain a continually evolving knowledge base of emerging
advances in AI-enhanced technologies that have the potential to significantly improve Healthy Aging and
AD/ADRD care. This database will summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of these technologies and
the types of settings where each technology could be used. The Clinical Translation and Validation Core will
also facilitate pairing of technology developers with clinical researchers and other stakeholders with interest in
validating AI-enhanced technologies. The activities of the Clinical Translation and Validation Core will increase
the impact of the pilot project program by providing teams with resources to bridge the gap between research
and implementation in real-world settings."

Within the Massachusetts AI and Technology Center for Connected Care in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease
(MAITC), the activities of the Networking and Mentoring Core will foster the development of high-impact project
pilot teams, a research community dedicated to the MAITC’s goals and the next generation of individuals
inspired to work at the intersection of AI, technology, Aging and AD/ADRD care. All networking and mentoring
activities will be structured to help nurture the development of researchers from underrepresented minorities;
underrepresented genders in their fields; people with disabilities; and those from socially, culturally,
economically, or educationally disadvantaged backgrounds.
In support of these goals, the Networking and Mentoring Core has three aims. The first aim is to establish and
grow a multidisciplinary network of researchers and practitioners using AI-enhanced technologies to support
Healthy Aging and AD/ADRD care. The Networking and Mentoring Core will play an integral role in forming
and supporting a multidisciplinary community with national scope connecting stakeholders (older adults, lay
caregivers, and clinicians, health systems and service providers), technology-focused and clinical researchers,
industry partners, investors, the NIA Small Business Office and others working to advance the goals of
developing, translating, validating and deploying emerging AI-enabled technologies to support healthy aging
and AD/ADRD care. Activities will include numerous multidisciplinary networking events, the development of a
robust online community and directory of research expertise, technology showcase events, and supports for
the creation of multidisciplinary pilot project teams. The Networking and Mentoring Core’s work will also focus
on maintaining strong within-center and cross-center synergy to result in leadership, graduate students and
trainees, and staff working cohesively toward the MAITC’s shared vision of supporting pilot project teams. The
second aim is to provide technology, needs assessment, user assessment and technology deployment training
for individuals interested in conducting work aligned with the MAITC’s goals so they have the knowledge and
resources to conduct high-quality research and integrate technologies based on MAITC research into real-
world settings. The Networking and Mentoring Core will also provide robust mentoring for pilot grant awardees,
junior faculty, and students to inspire the next generation of investigators to pursue careers at the intersection
of technology and health. The third aim is to provide thought leadership in MAITC’s focus areas via showcase
videos, thematic whitepapers, journal special issues, and conference sessions which highlight successful
application of AI-enabled technologies to support Healthy Aging and AD/ADRD care, as well as identify key
gaps where there is significant stakeholder need but no viable technologies to address these needs, thereby
catalyzing new areas of research."

The Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) Core plays a central role in achieving the goals
of the Massachusetts AI and Technology Center for Connected Care in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease
(MAITC) by identifying, selecting, advising, and helping to translate innovative pilot projects that use emerging
AI-enhanced technologies to address clinically and societally unmet needs in AD/ADRD. The AD/ADRD Pilot
Core will draw on the collective clinical, scientific, and technical expertise within MAITC and the valuable input
of our Stakeholder Core and Industry Advisory Board to complete the following specific aims: 1) Solicit and
select the most meritorious pilot studies that will develop and test novel AI-enhanced technologies that address
clinically important questions in AD/ADRD; 2) Provide mentorship, oversight, and resource supports for pilot
project investigators; 3) Assist pilot project investigators in refining their methods and translating their
technologies for clinical, industry, and research use. The AD/ADRD Pilot Core Leaders (Drs. Jasmeer
Chhatwal and Deborah Blacker) will work MAITC’s other core leaders to coordinate and oversee the pilot
project process. The AD/ADRD Pilot Core will solicit pilot projects from the training programs, departments, and
centers at universities and research institutions across the nation, drawing on an extensive pool of existing
investigators who have expertise in areas such as neurology, psychiatry, geriatrics, technology, computer
science, and artificial intelligence. Example topic areas for AD/ADRD pilot projects include: (1) Assessing
cognitive impairment-related safety concerns in the patient's home environment; (2) Assessing responses to
medical and behavioral interventions and promotion of healthy, potentially-protective behaviors in patients with
cognitive impairment; and (3) Informing critical but difficult decisions regarding level-of-care transitions and the
need for caregiving assistance inside or outside the home. Once selected, each pilot project leader will be
assigned two mentors (at least one of whom will have AD/ADRD clinical expertise) who will provide research
guidance and facilitate access to needed resources. The AD/ADRD Pilot Core will work with the other MIATC

10899760,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - Cell Procurement and Processing Core
The purpose and objective of the Cell Procurement and Processing (Cell P&P) Core remains to advance the
understanding of hematopoiesis and nonmalignant disorders through the distribution of high-quality
hematopoietic products to the hematology research community. To meet this need, the early precursors of
Cell P&P Core was first established in 1999 under the original CCEH P30. Over the almost 20-year history,
The Cell P&P Core has become recognized as a national resource for normal hematopoietic cell products, as
evidenced by the 171 investigators at 69 institutions who have received hematopoietic products during the
previous award period. Moreover, utilization of resources from the Core have continued to grow and facilitate
investigations that have advanced our understanding of the biology governing normal hematopoiesis and
nonmalignant disorders. As part of the proposed award, the Cell P&P Core will leverage its expertise,
infrastructure, and experiences to increase production and utilization of the high-quality products to advance the
field of hematology research, while maintaining the current high standards for product quality as detailed in the
Research Strategy. Therefore, the Cell P&P Core proposes the following:
Specific Aim 1. Expand the number of users for enriched hematopoietic cell products of the highest
quality and uniformity to facilitate hematology research. We propose three new approaches to increase
user numbers. 1) The Cell P&P Core develop a novel User Satisfaction and Needs Program to provide
feedback and identify new users. 2) The Core will develop Virtual Workshops targeting existing and new
users. 3) The Core will develop a novel funding mechanism called Cell P&P New Investigator Award that
provide resources at significantly reduced prices. Specific Aim 2. Develop user-friendly, integrative and
comprehensive Data Management System (DMS) for hematopoietic specimens. The proposed DMS will
incorporate real-time assessment for tracking and retrieval of donor characteristic, pre-analytic variables,
SOPs, inventory, quality controls, quality assurances, and specimen distribution, which will have two major
beneficial effects. 1) The Core will be able to more efficiently provide users with the essential variables related
to their research. 2) The Core will be able to more rapidly and comprehensively assess quality measures and
evaluate potential variables impacting product uniformity. Specific Aim 3. Develop new and innovative
user-directed products to facilitate hematology research. Given the explosion of new technologies to
examine hematopoietic cells, it remains a challenge for investigators to acquire the skills to take advantage of
these technologies. By combining the expertise of Cell P&P and Tool Cores, we will be able to efficiently
develop and deliver user-directed products to those investigators who may not otherwise be able to develop
these products within their labs. Through these deliverables, we will broaden the research potential for these
investigators and provide a mechanism to increase hematology research."
10899766,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - Canine Disease and Transplantation Model (Canine) Core
Hematopoiesis is a complex process which is regulated by many internal and external factors. Numerous
variables synergize or antagonize to influence differentiation and stem cell maintenance. These mechanisms
that control the hematopoietic system are difficult to deconstruct into fundamental parts. Thus, hematopoietic
stem cells are difficult to maintain in vitro, because the cells' responses to culture conditions are dictated by so
many influences. The conclusions drawn from in vitro cell-based assays are then necessarily limited by the
complexity of the system. There are many meritorious reasons to manipulate stem cells: correct a mutation,
render them drug resistance, and control their antigenic profile to name a few. They can be modified for
several purposes, but critically they must retain stem cell function. The only definitive assay for stem cell
function is hematopoietic reconstitution following lethal conditioning. Therefore, animal model systems are
used to reveal the fundamental biology of hematopoietic stem cells. However, no single animal model can fully
recapitulate the human hematopoietic system, so we propose to offer the canine as a model to complement
hematopoietic studies in mice. Canines address some of the key differences between mice and humans
notably size, lifespan, and genetic diversity. Additionally, dogs have relatively large litters, which can be useful
for histocompatibility and transplantation. This Canine Core will use engineered somatic mutations,
spontaneous germline mutations, and develop canine biological reagents for non-malignant hematopoietic
research. The accumulated knowledge of canine husbandry and stem cell transplantation, as well as existing
facilities at Fred Hutch, make this Canine Core unique. In conjunction with the expertise of the other CCEH
Cores, the entire breadth of an experiment can be completed. The Cell P&P core can isolate and store stem
cells, these cells can be modified in the Tools core, the stem cell character can be verified in a canine-to-
mouse transplant in the Xenografting Core, and the Canine Core can provide a large animal in vivo model to
study the biology of stem cell modifications. Internal and external users of this core will be able to take
advantage of decades of experience enriching stem cells, manipulating them, and assaying them in
xenografts, as well as the 60 years of institutional experience with the canine model."
10903961,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Overactive bladder (OAB) (i.e. urinary urgency, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, frequency, and
nocturia) affects 1 in 7 U.S. men and women and results in substantial impairment to quality of life (QOL). To
help self-manage and cope with OAB, many people adopt compensatory bladder behaviors, such as restricting
fluids, using containment products, strategic planning and mapping restroom access, and even curtailing
activities or travel altogether, which further adversely impact QOL. These behaviors may be driven by anxiety
and stress related to urinary urgency and incontinence episodes as well as ensuing distress and embarrassment.
Prior research has linked anxiety and OAB: up to 40% of women and 30% of men with OAB also have
generalized anxiety disorder. The link between stress and OAB is less studied. In animals, experimental stress
can cause OAB-like symptoms and behaviors as well as bladder and somatic hypersensitivity. In limited human
studies, women with OAB may have greater physiologic and psychologic stress reactivity, and acute stress may
exacerbate urinary urgency. However, how stress impacts on the bladder in the context of OAB or what
psychological factors drive compensatory behaviors that impair QOL in OAB remain unknown, as there are no
highly-controlled studies of anxiety-OAB links. Understanding these relationships would be a critical advance to
individualizing care of patients with OAB. The proposed project will comprehensively investigate for the first time
how stress, anxiety and OAB interact, including the impacts on bladder sensitivity, urinary symptoms, and
compensatory bladder behaviors. We propose a feedforward loop, whereby increased OAB symptoms increase
anxiety (via response to coping with stressful situations), which in turn increases OAB symptoms (via increased
bladder sensitivity). We further propose that compensatory behaviors are driven by anxiety-related learning
processes that help perpetuate this relationship. We will test our hypotheses in a sample of men and women
with OAB and healthy controls. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that acute, experimentally induced psychological
stress will be more strongly associated with increased bladder sensitivity in OAB patients than in controls, using
a novel bladder sensation meter with oral hydration and stress induction procedures. Aim will test the hypothesis
that psychological stress and anxiety will have concurrent and lagged effects on day-to-day urinary symptoms
that are stronger in individuals with OAB than in controls, using an ecological momentary assessment approach
(7-day electronic diary) to examine prospective associations between everyday perceived stress, anxiety and
urinary symptoms. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that compensatory behaviors (i.e. coping) used at the time of
voiding will be associated with subsequent reductions in anxiety levels, using a 3-day sensation-related bladder
diary that captures concurrent bladder behaviors and anxiety symptoms as well as lagged symptoms 30 minutes
post-void. Delineating these relationships and patterns will allow for identification of potentially modifiable factors
or areas for intervention, which we envision as a future R01 clinical trial submission."
10839939,"SUMMARY
While vaccination is the most efficient tool for the prevention of infectious diseases both in developed and
developing countries, the implementation of effective vaccination programs is challenging. The development,
introduction and implementation of effective vaccination depends on availability of locally generated evidence,
especially data required by local regulatory authorities. An essential requirement to make this happen is to
have well-trained local researchers who have a clear understanding of the process behind vaccine
development, vaccine introduction and program implementation. Training of researchers on the achieved
impact of vaccination on antimicrobial resistant infections, the relevance of indirect protection and the biological
pressure induced by vaccination programs are examples of well-established vaccination topics that are
commonly overlooked. A proper understanding of the effects of vaccination on unvaccinated groups through
indirect or herd immunity is crucial, but this is frequently misinterpreted. Moreover, there is a growing distrust in
vaccines and vaccination programs that needs to be addressed by researchers with appropriate technical
skills. Thus, there is a growing global need for training in vaccinology and the study of vaccine-preventable
diseases encompassing the entire process from vaccine development to field implementation and program
evaluation. To address these needs, Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), the Instituto de
Investigacion Nutricional (IIN) and the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) are joining forces to
build the Peru-Vanderbilt Prevention through Vaccination Training Program (PREVENT). The overall goal of
PREVENT is to develop a cadre of researchers and educators equipped with modern knowledge and expertise
to lead vaccine preventable diseases research and training in Peru and to encourage US-based researchers to
engage in vaccination research in low- and middle-income country (LMICs). PREVENT builds on the very
successful 14-year Research Partnership with the IIN and UPCH and on the Vanderbilt Vaccine Training and
Evaluation Unit and the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology's expertise in the study of vaccine preventable
diseases, training and mentoring. PREVENT will support 10 medium-long term trainees (Master's, PhD and
faculty fellowships). Specifically, PREVENT aims to 1) Train a cadre of researchers and educators (trainers) to
conduct multidisciplinary vaccine preventable diseases research and build training capacity in Peru; 2) Train
scientists and future leaders in vaccine-preventable diseases research in Peru; and, 3) Ensure and document
PREVENT's long-term impact. The ongoing IIN/UPCH-Vanderbilt Research Partnership has proven highly
productive and successful. A new training program focusing on Vaccinology and the study of vaccine
preventable diseases and the growth of structures and efforts to increase grant success will move IIN and
UPCH toward a new horizon in vaccine preventable diseases and address Peru's need for a world-class
workforce trained in vaccinology."

Bladder cancer is one of the top ten most common cancers in the U.S., and one of the most expensive to treat.
Most cases (75%) are non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with high rates of recurrence (70%) and
progression (25%). While prognostic factors remain largely unknown, the success of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin
(BCG), an intravesical immunotherapy as the most effective therapy for NMIBC for over four decades,
highlights the potential of the inflammatory and immune environments in determining treatment response and
prognosis. Given the median age of bladder cancer diagnosis is 73 years, patients are commonly faced with
age-related loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia), increase of fat accumulation (obesity), or both (sarcopenic
obesity), which are all characterized by chronic inflammation and altered immune responses. These body
composition phenotypes are associated with tumor progression and increased mortality. Thus, we hypothesize
that body composition at diagnosis may shape the host inflammatory and immune milieu and impact bladder
cancer prognosis. This hypothesis will be tested in the Bladder Cancer Epidemiology, Wellness, and Lifestyle
Study (Be-Well; R01 CA172855, MPI: Kwan/Tang/Kushi) of newly diagnosed NMIBC patients from 2015-2019
at Kaiser Permanente, one of the largest prospective cohort studies of NMIBC, with 1,472 patients enrolled
with rich patient, clinical, and biospecimen data to examine genetic and lifestyle factors in prognosis and
survival. We propose to conduct a full investigation of body composition, inflammation, and immunity
in bladder cancer outcomes in Be-Well to determine how adiposity, muscle, and inflammatory and
immune biomarkers at diagnosis can identify NMIBC patients at high risk for treatment failure and/or
disease recurrence and progression. Our aims are: 1) to determine the association of computed
tomography (CT)-derived body composition phenotypes (sarcopenia, adiposity, myosteatosis) with NMIBC
recurrence (first and multiple) and progression; 2) to determine the association of body composition with BCG
immunotherapy outcomes including adverse events and treatment failure; 3) to examine the association of
circulating inflammatory and immune biomarkers with body composition and BCG outcomes and NMIBC
prognosis; 4) explore if the addition of body composition measures and inflammatory and immune biomarkers
improves the performance of current risk stratification models for NMIBC patients. Given the common clinical
use of CT, body composition measures could be readily incorporated into the current clinicopathological factor-
based risk stratification system to improve the clinical care of NMIBC."
10771292,"Project Abstract/Summary
• Our framing hypothesis is that the combined constraints of peptide processing, HLA allelic specificity, and
peptide editing generate a significant “funnel effect”, where the peptidome constitutes only a tiny percentage of
all possible peptides obtainable from a cell’s proteome and the ligandome constitutes only a small percentage
of all peptides from a cell’s peptidome. Our research focus is understanding how the interplay of differential
sequence recognition at each step ultimately informs functional presentation of a highly restricted subset of all
possible proteome-derived peptides – and how to identify the most “translatable” pHLA targets from ligandomes.
• We will rigorously test this hypothesis using our allele-specific mass-spec platform for peptide discovery,
ARTEMIS, to identify relevant, HLA-restricted peptides from Mesothelin and high-risk HPV E6/E7 oncoproteins.
Identified peptides will be validated and characterized biochemically. Cell-surface displayed peptide arrays from
E6/E7 and Mesothelin will be used to determine the magnitude of the “funnel effect” of peptide processing on
peptidome composition. Patient T cell responses to identified Mesothelin peptides will be mapped using state-
of-the-art methodologies. Unusual peptides and alternate binding conformations will be characterized crystallo-
graphically. We will assess viral immunoevasion mechanisms, HLA-G presentation and receptor interactions,
and the presentation of glycosylated peptides. Deliverables include mapping the full Mesothelin and E6/E7
presentomes across multiple alleles and presentation modalities, ranked for future clinical exploitation as immu-
notherapy targets.
• Significance: From a basic science perspective, assaying cellular peptidomes and ligandomes is fundamental
for understanding how the immune system responds to infections and cancer, immunoevasion mechanisms, the
recognition rules of MHC proteins, the mechanistics of antigen processing/editing, and how self is defined. From
a translational perspective, validated HLA-restricted peptides represent targets for diagnosis and therapy,
through therapeutic vaccination, engineered T cell-based adoptive immunotherapies, and antibody-based recog-
nition of specific, disease-associated peptide/HLA complexes Our proposed studies advance both objectives by
elucidating the underlying molecular principles governing peptide processing and presentation through inte-
grated studies of an extended set of classical and non-classical human HLA class I proteins and, in the process,
identify specific pHLAs useful for future clinical applications."
10906883,"The focus of the research in the Lamb lab is to determine mechanisms of the immunopathogenesis of malaria. The Evavold lab is one of the leading laboratories working in T cell biology with the capability to precisely measure the affinity profile of polyclonal T cell populations. Together we will address the long-term goal of this proposal which is to define the salient features of the T cell response during Plasmodium infections that drives the pathology of malaria. It is estimated that annually more than 500 million people are infected with malaria worldwide resulting in 0.5 million deaths. T cell responses against the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria are critical in orchestrating immune effector mechanisms such as phagocytosis and antibody production to control parasitemia. However, T cells are also responsible for the pathogenesis of infection. The features that determine beneficial versus pathogenic T cells in malaria are incompletely understood. Here we propose that the affinity of CD8 T cells reacting to Plasmodium peptides shapes the repertoire of expanded cells and profoundly alters their function, in turn impacting pathogenesis. Although others have identified T cell epitopes that are immunodominant in Plasmodium infections, we know very little about the antigen reactivity profile of these pathogenic T cells as infection progresses. In general, it is believed that high affinity T cells predominate any polyclonal T cell response, yet this is not supported by our preliminary data which clearly shows that low affinity T cells make up >80% of the pathogenic anti-Plasmodium response. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that this predominance of low affinity CD8 T cells is a unique feature of Plasmodium infection that leads to organ specific damage because CD8 T cells with low affinity T cell receptors induce different responses in cross-presenting brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) compared with high affinity CD8 T cells. The rationale for the proposed work is that T cell responses are central to the organ-specific attack associated with malaria, and a more comprehensive understanding of the T cell response will provide key information for the rational use and design of novel anti-malaria interventions as well as future vaccines. We plan to test our central hypothesis and, thereby, accomplish the objective of this application, by pursuing the following three specific aims: Aim 1: Demonstrate that low affinity CD8 T cells are pathogenic in experimental cerebral malaria Aim 2: Define the functional differences between low and high affinity CD8 T cells trafficking to the CNS in Plasmodium infection Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that low affinity CD8 T cells predominate the response based on the context of how the parasite antigens are recognized."

 Myosteatosis is a measure of body composition, which measures the presence and degree of fatty infiltration
into the muscle compartment to include deposition around the muscle fibers/bundles, as well as into the
muscle tissue itself. Our work on this measure of ectopic fat has shown myosteatosis to be strongly and
significantly associated with measures of glucose regulation, independent of visceral and hepatic adiposity.
Given the strong links between the glucose dysregulation (i.e. metabolic syndrome and/or diabetes mellitus)
and arterial stiffness, as well as left ventricular structure and function, we believe the study of myosteatosis
may be particularly relevant as a determinant of heart failure. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites,
Hispanic/Latino Americans have significantly higher rates of obesity, cardiometabolic risk factors and type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM), resulting in an increased risk for heart failure. To assess the risk factors for different
chronic diseases in this burgeoning population, the NIH commissioned the Hispanic Communities Health
Study – Study of Latinos (HCHS-SOL). In 2007, this study began recruitment at four different field centers
and enrolled over 16,000 Hispanic/Latino Americans from diverse background heritage groups. The HCHS-
SOL has now completed two clinic visits and is scheduled to begin enrollment for visit 3 in December 2019. At
this visit, the study will update the medical history, obtain fasting blood samples that will be used to measure
glucose, insulin and hemoglobin A1C, and will acquire a 2-hour glucose tolerance test. Additionally, the study
will conduct the following assessments on the returning participants: 1) objectively measured physical activity
and sedentary behavior; 2) peripheral arterial disease by the ankle and toe brachial indices, as well as Doppler
waveforms and pulse volume recordings; 3) arterial stiffness by carotid femoral pulse wave velocity and 4)
cardiac structure and function by magnetic resonance imaging. This ensemble of measurements can be utilized
to assess the pathway from physical activity/sedentary behavior to body composition to cardiometabolic risk to
arterial stiffness to cardiac structure and function. Given this, we propose to leverage the existing HCHS-SOL
infrastructure and add the acquisition of new computed tomography scans of the abdomen and mid-thigh to
obtain measurements of myosteatosis and skeletal muscle mass, as well as subcutaneous, visceral and hepatic
adiposity. The goal of this project is to determine the applicability of myosteatosis to the aforementioned
pathway among Hispanic/Latino Americans from diverse background heritages, independent of other
measures of body composition."

Abstract: The high failure rate of translating discovery science to positive clinical outcomes in the treatment of
psychiatric diseases demonstrates the necessity of improving the efficiency and rigor of the therapeutic
development pipeline. To this end, the critical importance of advancing the discovery of in vivo physiological and
behavioral measures of the engagement of specific circuits for normal cognitive function has been acknowledged

disrupted functional connectivity in the HPC-PFC circuit is a common feature of anxiety, bipolar disorder,
schizophrenia, and autism, how local cellular interactions within this circuit manifest as large-scale temporal
coordination to support higher cognitive functions remains unknown. Addressing this fundamental gap in our

The long-term goal of this research is to define the mechanisms of action of a successful cell transplantation
therapy for chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) and to translate this knowledge from bench to bedside for patients.
Human SCI currently has no effective treatment, and any new treatments would have a significant impact on
public health. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine whether transplantation of regionally specific
bioprinted spinal neural progenitor cells (sNPCs) in combination with a 3D printed scaffold can result in the
formation of functional neuronal networks within the injured adult rat spinal cord. We have three specific aims.
The first aim is to optimize the biomaterial and design of the 3D printed scaffold, as well as the cell-laden bioink
utilized in bioprinting. The second aim is to determine the optimal cell configuration of two types of regionally
specific sNPCs within the scaffold to form functional neuronal networks. The third aim is to test our scaffold in a
rat model of transection injury to determine whether our cells can provide a relay system across the site of injury,
and whether this will result in functional recovery. We will perform detailed functional, histological, and
electrophysiological analyses to elucidate the mechanisms of our combinatorial treatment. The scientific
premise is that there is a synergistic relationship in providing the substrate (cells) for a relay system across the
injury site and optimizing this with a conduit (scaffold), providing an effective relay for neuronal signaling leading
to functional recovery."

Suicide rates among Hispanics in the United States have increased in the last two decades; coupled with rapid
growth of the Hispanic population, suicide among Hispanics is a pressing public health issue. Considering the
role of culture in suicide can elucidate unique and modifiable mechanisms for suicide. The Candidate’s long-
term research goal is to optimize suicide prevention interventions for Hispanics by targeting cultural
determinants of health. Reaching that goal requires mentored training in three domains of suicide prevention
research and completion of a research project to produce substantive, foundational results (described below).
First, the candidate needs to gain expertise in randomized clinical trials methodology for suicide interventions
(Objective 1) to conduct a trial with at risk Spanish-speaking adults in a reliable, valid, and ethical manner, and
test target engagement with an experimental therapeutics approach. Second, the candidate needs to gain
expertise in optimizing behavioral interventions to impact cultural determinants of health via human-centered
design (Objective 2) to deliver a treatment protocol that is culturally-usable and optimized to increase cultural-
social engagement. Third, as smartphone technology increases precision to measure mechanisms, the
candidate needs to gain expertise in the use of novel smartphone technology for precise assessment of target
engagement in clinical trials (Objective 3) to optimally/ethically use this technology in clinical trials research.
The principal objective of the proposed research study is to use an experimental therapeutics approach to
examine whether a behavioral intervention (SOCIAL ENGAGE; S-ENGAGE) can increase cultural-social
engagement (intervention target) and decrease suicide risk (clinical outcome) among Hispanic adults.
First, human-centered design approaches will be used to iteratively refine and optimize S-ENGAGE to alter
cultural-social engagement via iterative feedback from 5 Spanish-speaking adults with low cultural-social
engagement and recent ideation. Second, 60 Spanish-speaking adults who report low cultural-social
engagement and recent ideation will be randomized into 10-weeks of S-ENGAGE or an expectancy-matched
control. Participants will provide 2-weeks of real-time data via smartphone at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-
month follow-up and complete semi-structured interviews. Research Aims are to: (1) Optimize S-ENGAGE for
target engagement. (2) Test target engagement: Does S-ENGAGE increase cultural-social engagement
among Spanish-speaking adults?; (3) Test clinical impact: Does S-ENGAGE decrease suicide risk among
Spanish-speaking adults?; (4) To contextualize findings: What components of S-ENGAGE were most helpful?
The resulting findings of this K23 project will function as the basis for a larger R01-funded study powered to
examine whether the proposed target (cultural-social engagement) leads to changes in the clinical outcome
(suicide ideation). The candidate will build on the skills acquired in this period of mentored career development
to contribute to the development and refinement of approaches to suicide prevention for Hispanics."
10881763,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Abstract)
The importance of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer is clear. The fundamental role of DNA methylation in
cancer initiation and progression, however, remains elusive. The use of gene targeting in animal models
definitively demonstrated that genetic mutations at specific genes cause disease. An analogous “epigenetic gene
targeting” approach is urgently needed to advance the field of epigenetics. In human lung cancers, p16 promoter
methylation associated epigenetic silencing is one of the earliest detected epimutations and is thought to function
as a critical initiating event in tumorigenesis. The importance of this epimutation is further underscored by the
associations with distinct gene mutation patterns, cancer prognosis, and response to therapy. However, the
molecular pathways linking aberrant DNA methylation, epigenetic silencing, and tumorigenesis remain poorly
characterized. In this regard, we published the first mouse model demonstrating that targeted p16 epimutation
drives spontaneous tumor development. Importantly, our preliminary studies revealed that p16 epimutation
operates synergistically with oncogenic K-RAS activation to drive lung cancer progression. Based on these
findings, this proposal responds to PAR-20-131: Research Projects to Enhance Applicability of Mammalian
Models for Translational Research. Our overall goals are to establish more faithful murine models of human lung
cancer development and to utilize this epigenetically engineered mouse model for testing novel epigenetic
therapeutic strategies. Specifically, we will: 1 − Employing epigenetic engineering in mice to model advanced
human lung cancers. We propose to establish clinically relevant and immunocompetent mouse models based
on defined genetic and epigenetic alterations to drive benign lung tumor growths towards the ultimate malignant
phenotype. 2 − Testing combinatorial epigenetic therapy in mouse lung tumors carrying a driver p16 epimutation.
We propose to test whether epigenetic targeting drugs and/or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy can effectively
suppress p16 epimutant lung tumor growth during critical transition points from non-malignant lesions to
adenocarcinoma. These studies will elucidate the functional role of epimutations in lung tumorigenesis in vivo.
Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide a mechanistic rationale to refine ongoing epigenetic
therapy, with the potential to improve survival rates in lung cancer."
10910007,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Seventy% of older adults (60+ yr) are overweight or obese and many are unable or unwilling to exercise
due to exercise intolerance and/or dyspnea on exertion (DOE). We have identified numerous obesity-
related effects that could influence exercise tolerance and DOE in obese adults. We have also identified
many age-related ventilatory constraints in nonobese older adults. However, it is unclear whether obesity-
related and aging-related effects combine to reduce exercise tolerance, provoke DOE, or contribute to
respiratory symptoms in older obese adults. We propose that many of the obesity-related effects in older
obese adults are the result of low lung volume breathing, i.e., a reduction in functional residual capacity
(FRC) at rest and end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) during exercise. Increased fat on the chest wall
produces low FRC and EELV levels, where breathing limitations like expiratory flow limitation (EFL) and
enhanced perception of dyspnea are more likely to occur due to the age-related decline in maximal
expiratory flow at low lung volumes. Our overall hypothesis is that respiratory limitations, exercise
intolerance, DOE, and respiratory symptoms in older obese adults are due to mechanical loading of the
thorax and low lung volume breathing. We propose to test this hypothesis with the use an external cuirass
(i.e., a plastic shell over the thorax) to mechanically unload the chest wall. This will decrease the load on the
thorax thereby increasing FRC at rest and EELV during exercise, and potentially decrease the work of
breathing during exercise. The overall objective of this application is to investigate the effects of
obesity on lung function, exercise tolerance, and DOE in older obese adults as compared with older
adults without obesity, using a novel probe for mechanically unloading the thorax at rest and during
exercise. We will use 1) continuous negative cuirass pressure, and 2) assisted biphasic cuirass
ventilation to decrease obesity-related effects in older obese adults. Our approach will be to examine
respiratory function, exercise tolerance, and DOE with and without mechanical unloading in older obese
men and women (65-75 yr), including those with respiratory symptoms, as compared with older adults
without obesity. Specific Aims: We will test the following hypotheses: Aim 1) Obesity will decrease
respiratory function but to a greater extent in older obese adults with respiratory symptoms; Aim 2)
Obesity will decrease exercise tolerance but not cardiorespiratory fitness, except in older obese
adults with respiratory symptoms where both may be reduced; Aim 3) Obesity will increase DOE but
to a greater extent in older obese adults with respiratory symptoms; and Aim 4) Mechanical
unloading of the thorax will improve respiratory function, exercise tolerance, and DOE in older
obese adults, but to a greater extent in older obese adults with respiratory symptoms. These results
will have broad and immediate clinical impact on the care of older obese adults with DOE."

This research program aims to develop novel modeling methods, tools, and guidelines to incorporate
racialized lived experiences into mathematical models of infectious disease transmission by explicitly
modeling structural drivers of racial disparities in infectious disease exposure, susceptibility and severity,
and consequences. In particular, this research will intentionally engage with geographic disparities in the
United States through geographic information systems (GIS) coded data to highlight the importance of
social context and determinants across the life course to the transmission of infectious diseases.
We will employ systems science to analyze in silico simulations and post-hoc data analysis of simulation
output to understand the structural drivers of infectious disease disparities. In silico simulation allows for
the development of synthetic populations that represent individuals and households (and their
characteristics) within a particular geographic area. We plan to modify the model structure to explore the
impact and specificity gained by adding a variety of model characteristics, including stochasticity, natural
history, and environmental influence. We then aim to perform comprehensive sensitivity analyses
accounting for social and political context and the incorporation of multiple interacting factors that may help
identify patterns in spread of particular disease types. Ultimately, the goal of the in silico simulations is to
mathematically link policy effects to health outcomes through racialized lived experiences (represented
and parameterized as agent characteristics). While the modeling frame will be flexible, we will use data on
SARS-CoV-2 and influenza as two examples to demonstrate the feasibility of the methods we develop.
The results from this work will allow us to develop policy recommendations for structural interventions to
reduce racial disparities in infectious disease outcomes. Incorporating structural interventions into the
model structure will require flexibility to account for the interference and feedback with individual behaviors.
The structural interventions we plan to examine using in silico simulations include eliminating residential
segregation, increasing accessibility to stable housing, reducing income inequality, and distribution of
healthy food choices represented by real-world programs across the United States. This research will lay
the groundwork to inform ongoing control of existing and emerging infectious disease pathogens and
prevent the unequal health- and cost-related burdens on communities of color."

Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract often complicated by
intestinal fistulas and strictures that can result in irreversible bowel damage. Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha
(anti-TNF) biologics are efficacious in treating CD but many patients do not respond to anti-TNF therapy. The
armamentarium for CD is rapidly increasing with new therapies that target novel pathways, such as anti-
interleukin 12/23 (anti-IL12/23) agents. There is an urgent need to develop precision medicine approaches for
selecting the right treatment for the individual CD patient. Our group has identified a novel cellular module in ileal
surgical resection tissue from severe CD patients called the IgG plasma cells, Inflammatory Mononuclear
phagocytes, Activated T cells, and Stromal cells (GIMATS) module. We have demonstrated that treatment naïve
patients with high GIMATS enrichment in ileal biopsies are significantly more likely to fail anti-TNF therapy.
However, tissue-based biomarkers are less scalable for clinical application, while blood-based markers will be
more easily implemented and validated. More recently, in work as part of my K23, we demonstrated that a panel
of peripheral blood proteins assayed at time of diagnosis in CD patients can predict anti-TNF treatment response.
This blood protein panel performed similarly in two independent cohorts and could distinguish anti-TNF
responders better than clinical features alone. We aim to build upon this prior work by expanding the number of
proteins assayed as potential biomarkers of anti-TNF response. We hypothesize that the performance of our
anti-TNF blood protein panel will improve through the addition of markers selected from a discovery panel
enriched for proteins highly expressed in cell types associated with anti-TNF resistance (GIMATS module). In
Aim 1, we propose to evaluate the association of an expanded panel of blood proteomic markers with anti-TNF
response in anti-TNF treated CD patients from the Risk Stratification and Identification of Immunogenetic and
Microbial Markers of Rapid Disease Progression in Children with Crohn’s Disease (RISK) and the Ocean State
Crohn’s Colitis Area Registry (OSCCAR) cohorts. In Aim 2, we will then explore the association of blood
proteomic markers with anti-IL12/23 response, including understanding the drug specificity of anti-TNF response
protein panels, in two prospective cohorts of CD patients treated with anti-IL12/23 therapy. In both aims, we will
utilize a highly sensitive, robust, replicable proteomics assay that is sample sparing with high potential for
scalability. Data generated through this R03 award will serve as a foundation for future R01 applications by
expanding our proteomic discovery efforts, improving the performance of blood protein panels of anti-TNF
response, and exploring blood markers of response to a new class of biologic (anti-IL12/23 therapy)."
10857294,"Project Summary/Abstract
Human cancer genomes show a complex pattern of mutations that, upon computational deconvolution, resolves
into a systematic series of over 80 “Mutational Signatures” (the pattern of mutations across all possible
trinucleotide sequence contexts). Some signatures are common to many cancers (e.g., CGàTA in CpG sites)
whereas others appear in single tumor types (e.g., signatures involving GCàTA mutations that are presumably
associated with aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) exposure in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)). Current sequencing efforts
sometimes provide hints, via examination of the details of mutational signatures, as to cancer mechanistic
etiology. The first two Aims of the present proposal are a bottom up approach to determine which specific
chemical insults to DNA cause mutational patterns that match mutational signatures in tumors. We have
formulated a model that describes three variables that contribute to the complexity of mutational spectra: The
likelihood that a DNA lesion will form in a particular context, the likelihood that it will evade repair, and the
likelihood that it will miscode when traversed by a polymerase. Aim 1 uses a combination of synthetic and
analytical chemistry to generate the adduct-formation spectrum of a host of DNA damaging agents (AFB1,
sterigmatocystin, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, streptozotocin, temozolomide, chloroacetaldehyde and the oxidant
SIN-1). A strategy involving the use of heavy isotope containing defined-sequence oligonucleotides will be used
along with mass spectrometry to map the binding specificities of electrophiles derived from these agents. Aim 2
takes a two-pronged approach to define the biological effects of DNA damage from the studied agents. Since
the DNA adducts of the compounds evaluated are known, we shall insert those adducts one at a time into
defined-sequence oligonucleotides in all 16 possible 3-base contexts (i.e., 5’-NXN-3’, where X is the adduct and
N is A, G, C or T). The oligonucleotides will be inserted into viral genomes, replicated in cells of defined repair
or replication status, and the areas of the genome that contained the lesion will be characterized to define the
type, amount, genetic requirements for - and sequence context dependency of - mutagenesis. The second part
of Aim 2 is to use a newly developed mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) line to define, using Duplex Consensus
Sequencing (DCS), the high-resolution mutational spectra (HRMS) of the agents under study. These data are
compared via informatics techniques (e.g., cosine similarity) to human cancer mutational signatures and to the
DNA binding (Aim 1) and mutagenic properties of individual adducts. Lastly, a damaged nucleotide pool is an
often-overlooked source of mutations. Aim 3 uses the MEF line of Aim 2 to probe the opportunity of a pool
damaged with products of oxidative stress (e.g., 8-oxoG and 5-chlorocytosine) to impact the HRMS of the MEF
line. Further, we have custom-designed a pool mutagen (fKP1212), which we believe might be useful to diversify
the neoantigen arrays of cancer cells in advance of cancer immunotherapy. We plan to apply our HRMS tools to
investigate the pre-clinical potential of a novel adjuvant therapy for cancer.

This proposal is in response to PAR 18-796 to seek support for advancing methodologies for a transfer
learning framework for the digital curation of the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) clinical narrative. In the
current era of increasing importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in biomedicine, our proposal tackles a critical
AI component – automated annotation of health-related text. Since 2015 the development and application of
machine learning (ML) methods has exploded propelled by the convergence of plentiful digitized unstructured
data (text, speech, images), hardware and the refinement of neural networks or deep learning. 2018 marked a
turning point in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly transfer learning through pre-trained models
like Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification, Allen AI's ELMO, OpenAI's Open-GPT. In
November 2018, Google published the Bidirectional Encodings Representations from Transformers (BERT), a
transformer-based model pre-trained on massive general text databases (3.3B words total). The publication
reported using BERT representations to build classifiers for 11 NLP tasks which outperformed the state-of-the-
art (SOTA) with large margins. The NLP research community jumped to the idea of exploring this new
framework but quickly came to the realization that building BERT-style models from scratch is affordable and
feasible to only a few. Thus, research investigation proceeded in the direction of using these gigantic models
as resources for language representations. Scientific efforts focused on pre-trained models (e.g. BERT) as a
source of extracting high quality language features or fine-tuning on a specific task, i.e. using a model as a
checkpoint and re-training with much smaller amounts of task-specific data to produce predictions by typically
adding one fully-connected layer on top of the representations and training for a few epochs. This general
watershed shift in NLP to transfer learning which parallels the developments in computer vision a few years
ago coupled with our latest work brings to the forefront a critical NLP research topic ripe for exploration – a
transfer learning framework for the digital curation of the EMR clinical narrative. The proposed work is research
of novel scientific methods for extracting detailed information from health-related text especially the EMR, the
major source of phenotype data for patients. Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational
research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and systems changes on responsiveness.
This research is in line with the latest developments in neural deep learning approaches and AI in general and
is expected to enhance biomedical research and through that the health of the public."
10876420,"The long-term goal of this project is to define the function(s) of the cap-specific N6, 2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6 Am) present at the transcription start site of eukaryotic mRNAs. We and others recently identified the cellular mRNA methyltransferase responsible for methylation of the cap-proximal adenosine at the N6 position as phosphorylated carboxy-terminal domain interacting factor 1 (PCIF1). PCIF1 binds the phosphorylated C- terminal domain of host RNA polymerase II to selectively modify the cap proximal A, following the sequential methylation of the cap-structure by the guanine-N7-methylase and ribose-2'-O methylase. The functional significance of the cap-proximal m6Am modification is uncertain with published literature reaching different conclusions regarding mRNA stability and translation. Viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm such as the negative-strand RNA virus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) also contain this cap-proximal m6Am modification on mRNA synthesized in infected cells despite the absence of a viral encoded N6, 2'-O-dimethyltransferase. In preliminary data we have found that PCIF1 is relocalized to the cytoplasm in VSV infected cells and methylates VSV mRNA. The 5 VSV mRNAs are well characterized and we have developed tools necessary to define how m6Am influences the function of each of those mRNAs. Our preliminary data shows that neither mRNA stability nor mRNA translation is impacted by the loss of m6Am, and that in 293T and Hela cells in culture, virus replication is unaffected under basal conditions. Pretreatment of cells with interferon, however, demonstrates that loss of PCIF1 results in the further translational suppression of viral mRNA and a more pronounced reduction in viral growth. This PCIF1 dependent phenotype suggests that one function of this cap-proximal m6Am is to discriminate self from non-self mRNA. The mRNA cap has been hypothesized to have emerged with eukaryotic evolution, when PCIF1 is first detected, to replace the Shine-Dalgarno sequence for directing ribosomes to mRNAs and to protect mRNAs from digestion by 5' exoribonucleases thus providing an early method for distinguishing self- versus foreign mRNAs. It is likely that extant viruses have evolved in the face of this RNA methylation to evade the eukaryotic self-defense system. To further probe the role of PCIF1 modification of viral RNA we generated a PCIF1 -/- mouse providing an additional unique reagent to mechanistically dissect the role of m6Am of viral mRNA in vivo. Capitalizing on this preliminary data we will use genetic, biochemical, cell biological and virological approaches both in cell-culture and in vivo to dissect the role of m6Am and PCIF1 mediated mRNA methylation. Our underlying hypothesis is that PCIF1 modification of mRNA contributes to distinguishing self from non-self mRNA, and that viruses have coopted PCIF1 to ensure efficient replication."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in women worldwide and despite declines in all
other age groups, mortality rates attributed to CVD are increasing in women of childbearing age. Preeclampsia
is a well-established risk factor for CVD across diverse patient populations, however, there are currently no
evidence-based interventions targeting this at-risk patient population. While blood pressure control is the
cornerstone of postpartum management, emerging evidence suggests that management of hypertension alone
does not fully mitigate CVD risk after preeclampsia. The overall goal of this line of research is to begin to
develop and test novel pharmacologic interventions for postpartum management following preeclampsia,
representing a paradigm shift focused on endothelial recovery postpartum in addition to blood pressure control.
In this application, the objective is to conduct a single-site pilot trial to assess the feasibility and effect of low-
dose aspirin to augment vascular recovery in the immediate postpartum period after preeclampsia through two
specific aims: to pilot test the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial of postpartum low-dose
aspirin vs. placebo, and 2) to assess the effect of postpartum aspirin on endothelial function and blood
pressure. Our central hypothesis is that postpartum administration of low-dose aspirin following preeclampsia
will be feasible, improve endothelial function, and lower BP at 6 months postpartum. The research proposed in
this application is innovative in its novel adaptation of an evidence-based strategy to improve vascular function
and postpartum blood pressure in an understudied population with significant morbidity during a critical time
period. This proposal is significant as it will provide an opportunity to assess the feasibility and explore the
effect of low-dose aspirin on vascular function in addition to blood pressure. Effective interventions to improve
postpartum hypertension care and reduce long-term cardiovascular risk have broad implications for improving
maternal morbidity and reducing disparities in care. Our findings will provide a valuable framework to inform a
subsequent large-scale randomized trial of low-dose aspirin in the postpartum period following preeclampsia.
Successful completion of this line of research would represent a transformation in postpartum management of
women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and have a direct impact to improve hypertension and
cardiovascular-related maternal morbidity and mortality."
10893955,"Project Background: The Veterans Health Administration (VA) outsources care through its Community Care
(CC) program, a top VA priority. With the 2014 passage of the Veterans Choice Act came rapid expansion of
CC. While expanded CC is meant to enhance choice and access, emerging evidence raises concerns about
how VA patients experience it. Early CC implementation has been challenging, e.g., with limited availability of
CC providers and fragmented care coordination between VA and CC providers. Patient experiences of CC
may have special relevance for women, who use far more CC than men. Furthermore, nearly one in five new
women Veteran VA patients stops using, or “attrits” from, VA care, which is three-fold higher odds of attrition
than other women in VA. Our team has learned through our current CREATE study that patient experiences of
care can impact attrition: in preliminary analyses, odds of attrition in a fiscal year (FY) 2011 cohort were lower
for women who received CC care. However, in this post-expansion era of CC, it is not known whether CC will
continue to protect against attrition, whether the attrition rate among women will improve or worsen, how
specific types of CC may influence women's decisions to continue in versus leave VA care, or what patient
subgroups are at particular risk for CC-related attrition.
Project Objectives: The Specific Aims are to (1) model CC and other factors expected to predict attrition from
VA; (2) examine the longitudinal attrition trajectory pre/post expansion of CC; (3) characterize the facility-level
context of CC, to triangulate with Aims 1 & 2 results and inform Aim 4; and (4) examine women's experiences
of care and their perspectives on the relationship between CC and plans for future VA use.
Project Methods: Guided by a conceptual model that combines the Andersen Behavioral Model and
Consumer Choice Theory, we will conduct a mixed methods study designed to achieve integration at all levels:
design, methods, interpretation, and reporting. For Aim 1, we will analyze existing data sources in an FY17
national cohort of new women (N~23,000) and new men (N~200,000) VA primary care patients. For Aim 2, we
will model the attrition trajectory in sequential national cohorts (FY07-FY19Q2) of all women Veterans new to
VA, and separately, men. For Aim 3, we will conduct semi-structured interviews at two timepoints with
clinician/staff key stakeholders (n=30) involved in CC at ten purposively selected sites. For Aim 4, we will
conduct semi-structured interviews at two timepoints with new women Veteran primary care patients (n=70) at
Aim 3 sites who received a CC referral in FY20. Key stakeholders and women Veterans will be asked to
provide recommendations for organizational/policy changes that would improve CC and retention of Veterans
in VA care.
Significance and Relevance to Veterans' Health: Understanding the potential association between CC
experiences and attrition among women Veterans represents a critical topic, not only because women are far
more likely than men to be referred to CC and often receive gender-specific services that require heavy care
coordination, but also because the number of women Veteran VA patients has nearly tripled over the past 15
years. This study addresses the VA priority area of focusing resources more efficiently, by yielding results
relevant to system-level and policy changes: it will point to specific types of CC that are associated with greater
attrition risk, specific subgroups who are at more risk, and specific elements of VA delivery systems that
interact with CC to increase risk of attrition.
Next Steps: If this project meets the intended goals, the next step will be to work with our policy partners to
identify targets for change and intervention, to minimize attrition and maximize patient-centered care."

Individuals with rare genetic diseases do not receive attention from the medical and research community. One
out of two patients diagnosed with a rare disease is a child, meaning that patients and their families must endure
long battles relating to disease progress throughout their child’s lifetime. Therefore, characterization of
clinical/molecular aspects of rare diseases will greatly benefit young patients and their families.
SON is a DNA- and RNA-binding protein that plays dual roles as an RNA splicing factor and a transcriptional
repressor. Our research team recently identified Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim syndrome (ZTTK syndrome), a
rare genetic disease with multi-organ abnormalities caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the
SON gene (SON haploinsufficiency). Our research and publication played a key role in documenting this
syndrome in major public databases to facilitate clinical diagnosis. As a first step in supporting ZTTK families
and promoting awareness, we recently launched an official foundation, the ZTTK SON-Shine Foundation.
Our recent efforts revealed that many children with ZTTK syndrome experience various hematopoietic disorders
and immune dysfunction, which sometimes leads to life-threatening sepsis. To understand the hematopoietic
abnormalities associated with ZTTK syndrome, we have generated mouse models of Son knockout (KO) and
Son haploinsufficiency. Our preliminary data demonstrated that complete Son KO in hematopoietic cells causes
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) expansion and embryonic lethality. Furthermore, we found that Son
haploinsufficiency leads to abnormal proportions of lineage-primed multipotent progenitors (MPPs), with an
expansion of megakaryocyte-erythroid lineage-primed MPPs and a shrinkage of lymphoid lineage-primed MPPs,
which is already evident during fetal liver hematopoiesis and persists in adult hematopoiesis in the bone marrow.
Importantly, our RNA-sequencing analyses revealed that critical chromatin modifier genes were the major targets
dysregulated by Son haploinsufficiency in early stage hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs).
Based on these preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that Son haploinsufficiency directly and indirectly
alters the expression/splicing of key chromatin modifiers, which collectively reshapes chromatin status at the
level of HSCs and MPPs, and this leads to skewed lineage bias and impaired functional output of HSCs/MPPs.
To test these hypotheses, we will investigate how Son haploinsufficiency affects functional output of HSCs and
lineage primed MPPs in vivo (Aim 1), and will dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms by which Son
haploinsufficiency leads to HSPC abnormalities (Aim 2). Successful completion of this proposed study will
significantly advance our knowledge about ZTTK syndrome-associated abnormal hematological features and
will serve as a valuable resource to identify therapeutic strategies. Most importantly, this study will bring hope to
children and their families battling this rare disease."

I am finishing my cerebrovascular fellowship in the department of neurosurgery at the Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine, where I will start as an assistant professor of neurosurgery with a practice focused on cerebrovascular
diseases. I am applying for a mentored surgeon-scientist career development award (CDA) to obtain further
training in neuroscience, immunology, and animal models of cerebral ischemia. This will further my long-term
career goals of exploring neuro-immunologic mechanisms underlying cerebral ischemia, and hopefully provide
a basis for new investigations in patients experiencing ischemic stroke.
 A major mechanism underlying stroke pathology involves neuroinflammation, where activation of
microglia and infiltration of peripheral leukocytes worsen neuronal injury and cell death. Despite substantial pre-
clinical efforts, there exists no efficacious therapeutic in limiting post-stroke neuroinflammatory damage. Mast
cells are tissue specific, long-lived immunologic effector cells which are thought to be one of the first-responders
in immune surveillance and activation, activating multiple pathways of the innate immune system. As such, the
ability to suppress mast cell activation may broadly attenuate multiple pathways of cerebral inflammation after
stroke. Recently, Mrgprb2 was identified as a mast cell-specific G-coupled protein receptor for basic
secretagogues, mediating IgE-independent activation. I have shown preliminarily that deletion of Mrgprb2 results
in decreased stroke volume after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), with decreased
transcription and production of TNFa and CCL2 after stroke, and decreased neutrophil recruitment into the
ischemic brain. This CDA proposes building upon my pharmacology graduate training in mechanisms of cell
death and cocaine addiction, towards a new direction at the interface of neuroscience and immunology. I hope
this CDA will allow me to receive multidisciplinary training in the Departments of Neuroscience and Cellular and
Molecular Medicine. Specific training goals include: (1) Training in advanced basic neuroscience techniques
including dural and meningeal microdissection, and in-vivo live-animal imaging (2) Training in animal models
of cerebral ischemia including photo-thrombotic stroke (3) Didactic and experimental training in immunology
and neuro-immune interactions (4) Additional training in the ethical and responsible conduct of research.
 The research plan seeks to address the hypothesis that Mrgprb2 is a critical mast cell specific receptor
which upregulates the initial immunologic activation response after cerebral ischemia, and that inhibition of the
physiologic ligand for Mrgprb2 may decrease neuroinflammation after stroke. The Specific Aims of the proposal
are to: (1) Investigate which subset of mast cell mediators are regulated by Mrgprb2 in ischemic stroke (2)
Determine the localization and expression pattern of Mrgprb2 in central nervous system mast cells (3) Find the
endogenous ligand for Mrgprb2 in cerebral ischemia by screening of known Mrgprb2 agonists after tMCAO,
along with testing of inhibitors of Mrgprb2 as potential therapeutics of stroke."

11.2 million (23.5%) older adults report difficulty traveling outside their homes, making limited transportation
access a structural barrier to health. With over 7 million non-driving older adults and 7-10 non-driving years at
the end of life, alternative transportation options are needed. Lack of public transit accessibility can
disproportionally harm older adults with disabilities and may impact health behaviors, such as physical activity
and social participation. Physical activity and social participation are key components of healthy aging,
associated with cognition, quality of life, and mortality. To this end, identification of modifiable public transit
features, and their impact on physical activity and social participation among older adults with disabilities is
critically needed. The proposed research will examine the role of public transit on physical activity and social
participation among older adults with and without disabilities. This research will collect primary data on public
transit accessibility features and link them to the National Health and Aging Trends Study. Specifically, this
research will address the following aims: 1) Examine if self-reported public transit use is associated with
physical activity and social participation among older adults with and without disabilities, 2) Determine if the
accessibility of public transit systems is associated with physical activity and social participation behaviors
among older adults, 3) Test the hypotheses that public transit use partially mediates the link between public
transit features and (a) physical activity and/or (b) social participation among older adults. The proposed use of
NHATS, a rich, integrated data source will allow for investigation into whether public transit use interacts with
disability status to result in differential physical activity and social participation (Aim 1); if the density and
accessibility of public transit systems interact with disability status to affect physical activity and social
participation (Aim 2); and the mechanism through which disability, public transit features, and public transit use
shape physical activity and social participation among older adults (Aim 3). This research will examine if public
transit system access is associated with physical activity and social participation among older adults with
disabilities, a potential intervention target to optimize older adults’ ability to age in place. Identification of
modifiable, upstream factors could reduce health disparities among this population group. The findings from
this work will inform transportation development and planning about public transit systems which are inclusive
of older adults with disabilities."
10867348,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death in
women. Most breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER) positive. The primary cause of treatment failure
and death in patients with ER+ breast cancer is resistance to endocrine therapy (ET). Novel therapeutics
are needed to improve outcomes for patients with resistant tumors. Several findings demonstrate that the
RET receptor tyrosine kinase alters sensitivity to ET. RET expression in ER+ breast cancer is associated
with worse outcome and recurrent tumors that are resistant to ET express RET at higher levels than
primary tumors. Preliminary data show that RET is overexpressed over time in breast cancer cells treated
with ET and that inhibiting RET reduces ERK/MAPK activity and sensitizes ER+ cell lines and xenografts
to ET. We have established and validated ER+ breast cancer organoids which we will use to dissect
precise mechanisms of increased RET expression, how RET impacts sensitivity to ET, and how RET
directs kinase signaling with ET treatment. We hypothesize that high expression of RET in ET resistant
ER+ breast cancers drives tamoxifen resistance and is a therapeutic target to overcome resistance. To
test this hypothesis, in Aim1 we will define reprogramming of regulatory elements at the RET promoter
over time with tamoxifen leading to increased expression of RET. In Aim2, we will determine the efficacy
of targeting RET to enhance response to ET in cell lines, organoids, and patient derived xenografts.
Finally, in Aim3 we will determine how RET alters kinase signaling adaptation in response to tamoxifen
using a functional inhibitor bead capture assay coupled with mass spectroscopy. Cumulatively, these
studies will form a scientific basis to develop clinical strategies and select patients for RET inhibitor
therapy. In addition to advancing scientific knowledge, this proposal provides training to a physician-scientist.

This K01 research and training grant aims to use innovative value of information (VOI) analysis methods to
efficiently inform the prioritization and design of potential clinical research studies related to managing virologic
failure on dolutegravir (DTG)-based ART for adults (15 years and older) in Kenya, which will also have broader
implications for resource-limited settings (RLS). The introduction of generic DTG to RLS raises new questions
about optimum clinical management for people living with HIV for whom DTG-based regimens are failing.
Conducting furtherclinicalresearch can informand improve HIV treatment guidelines; however, research funding
resources are limited. Thus, it is important that methods for setting funding prioritie s maximize the potential
downstream health benefits of research. The proposed K01 will leverage an individual-based HIV epidemiologic
stochastic model, developed by Dr. Duarte, for a Kenyan adult (15 years and older) population. This project’s
research aims (R1-3) are to: R1) Given currently available data, evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of drug
resistance testing to inform choice of second-line ART for patients with unsuppressed viral load on DTG-based
ART; R2) Calculate the maximum potential returns on investment to be expected from further research related
to managing virologic failure on DTG-based ART and identify which research studies have the greatest potential
health benefit; and R3) Calculate the optimal sample size for potential key clinical studies identified in Aim 2.
The research aims of this study will provide Dr. Duarte the opportunity to pursue his training aims ( T1-4),
including: T1) Develop expertise in Bayesian theory and methods for model parameterization and calibration,
conducting VOI analyses, and designing clinical studies; T2) Develop expertise in VOI analysis, including
statistical methods for meta-model development; T3) Develop expertise in using open-source decision analysis
methods, including data visualization tools; and T4) Understand the methodologic and pragmatic aspects of
clinical study design, and develop relationships with stakeholders in Kenya and other RLS, in order to build
research collaborations. These research and training goals will provide Dr. Duarte with valuable expertise that
is applicable to a wide range of important health policy issues relevant to HIV, as well as other infectious disease
challenges, thereby preparing him to transition to independence. He will plan to submit an R01 grant focused on
informing the prioritization and design of clinical research to improve pediatric and maternal HIV health outcomes
in RLS. This R01 will leverage the expertise Dr. Duarte gains through the proposed K01 and combine it with his
ongoing, pilot grant-funded work building simulation models for pediatric and maternal HIV-affected populations.
Dr. Duarte will complete his K01 career development training at the University of Washington, which provides
an outstanding environment for training in computational methods and applying them to global health issues, as
the university has a strong >25-year history of collaboration with Kenyan institutions."

This competitive renewal Stanford T32 Training Grant Proposal combines pediatric and adult pulmonary
programs in order to select the most promising Trainees and provide an optimally diverse interdisciplinary
training experience centered on pulmonary biology. Dr. David Cornfield, the pediatric chief, Dr. Mark Nicolls,
the adult chief share Program Director responsibilities; each bringing unique and complementary skills to the
leadership position. In the first few years of this new T32 funded in 2016, we have accomplished our goal of
creating a more integrated and cohesive academic culture. We describe the excellent progress of our first nine
trainees. We have developed 38 Mentors from the Stanford biomedical community with a strong track record of
training and academic productivity and 2 Junior Mentors. Based on the expertise of our Mentors, we have
identified nine domains of excellence from which trainees can choose a primary focus for an individualized
development plan. These research areas include: 1) Vascular Disease, 2) Stem Cells & Lung Development, 3)
Genetics & Genomics, 4) Lung Injury & Repair, 5) Lung Immunology, 6) Lung Microbiome, 7) Lung Cancer and
8) Outcomes Research, and 9) Imaging.
The grant proposal describes a process by which fellows are recruited to Stanford, exposed to research areas,
introduced to Mentors, and move through a selective process designed to identify Trainees with the best
chance of success in academic medicine for T32 support. We describe a well-supported and carefully
constructed system of oversight to promote recruitment of underrepresented minorities. All T32 trainees will
have an individualized development plan that includes a core curriculum and electives appropriate to their
research domain. Through a longitudinal monthly T32 meeting lead by the PDs and quarterly informal
meetings with T32 trainees, Mentors and PDs, Trainees will be immersed in a microculture of academic
pulmonary medicine. A Scientific Oversight Committee identifies appropriate coursework and ensures ongoing
and timely Trainee progress. We have assembled an experienced Internal Advisory Committee at Stanford and
an acclaimed group of national leaders in pulmonary medicine for the External Advisory Committee. We will
utilize regular feedback from these groups, the Mentors and Trainees to identify programmatic strengths and
weaknesses and reassess our processes to adjust, adapt and improve the T32 fellowship. As a world
university embedded in a vibrant local economy, Stanford is particularly well situated to develop and inspire the
next generation of physician-scientists and clinical researchers."
10871869,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Contamination of drinking water and foods with inorganic arsenic (iAs) represents a major public health risk in
the U.S. and worldwide. Exposure to iAs has been linked to cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, respiratory and
neurological diseases.
Humans and most other mammalian species have developed mechanism for detoxification of iAs, which involves
a two-step conversion of iAs to methyl-As (MAs) and dimethyl-As (DMAs) and excretion of the methylated
metabolites in urine. In mammals, iAs methylation is catalyzed by orthologs of a single enzyme, arsenic
methyltransferase (AS3MT). An impaired capacity to methylate iAs, e.g., due to AS3MT polymorphism, has
been linked to increased risk of diseases associated with iAs exposure.
Mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of iAs exposure have been extensively studied using laboratory
models. However, laboratory research has been hindered by substantial differences between laboratory animals
and humans in their capacity to metabolize iAs. In particular, laboratory mice have been shown to methylate
and detoxify iAs much more efficiently than humans, making it difficult to reproduce in mice some of the adverse
phenotypes reported in population studies, specifically cancer and diabetes. The ultimate goal of the proposed
research is to develop novel mouse models, in which iAs metabolism resembles that in humans and in which
iAs-associated diseases can be studied at environmentally relevant iAs exposure levels.
We have recently generated a new mouse strain in which the Borcs7/As3mt locus was humanized by syntenic
replacement. AS3MT expression in tissues of the humanized (Hs/Hs) mice resembles that in human tissues
and differs from expression of mouse As3mt: AS3MT expression is lower in livers and much higher in adrenals.
Notably, the different pattern of AS3MT expression in tissues of Hs/Hs mice is associated with low efficiency of
iAs detoxification and with the profiles for iAs and its methylated metabolites in tissues and excreta that are
consistent with those reported in humans.
The goals of this project are: (1) To characterize susceptibility of Hs/Hs mice to adverse effects of iAs exposure,
focusing on the diabetogenic effects, (2) to generate a new mouse strain expressing AS3MT haplotype that has
been linked to impaired iAs methylation and risk of iAs-induced diseases in human cohorts, and (3) to explore
association between AS3MT expression in adrenals and adrenal function.
The proposed research will generate and validate unique mouse models for iAs toxicology. These models will
make it possible to study adverse effects of iAs at environmentally relevant exposure levels and in context with
human-like metabolism of iAs and AS3MT polymorphism. Using these models will markedly improve
translatability and impact of laboratory studies focusing on iAs induced diseases."

Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), applied to areas like the subthalamic nucleus (STN), is a standard treatment for
Parkinson Disease (PD), however, DBS has inherent surgical risks as well as potential for infections and
adverse side effects. Our overarching goal is to establish novel chemogenetic neuromodulation strategies in
nonhuman primates (NHPs) that utilize and build upon the strengths of DBS but resolve many DBS limitations,
and ultimately to translate these to clinical therapies in humans. We focus on Designer Receptors Exclusively
Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), which work via specialized excitatory or inhibitory receptors
genetically inserted into neurons. Our Research Plan, which integrates a robust Plan to Enhance Diverse
Perspectives, has a tool development (UG3) phase followed by a pre-clinical trial (UH3) phase. The main
objective of the UG3 is to: a) develop more effective and specific DREADD induction in NHPs: a) using a
circuit-specific retro-infection method to selectively infect the neurons comprising STN→GP pathway, believed
to be key to motor symptoms in PD, and b) use focused ultrasound prior to surgical delivery of viral constructs
to augment DREAD expression in the STN→GP circuit. We will use positron emission tomography (PET) and
behavioral assessments to gauge the strength of viable DREADD receptor expression, and post-mortem
histology to screen for neuropathology and to assess the density and anatomical distribution of transduced
neurons. The go/no-go for decision for moving to the UH3 will be based on: 1) Evidence of motor
abnormalities or behavioral change due to DREADD activation with an effect size ≥0.80, and/or 2) histological
evidence of DREADD expression in ≥35% of neurons in the STN. The main objective of the UH3 is to
determine if activation of DREADDs in STN neurons, using the oral DREADD agonist deschloroclozapine
(DCZ), reduces motor abnormalities NHPs treated with a neurotoxin to induce a PD-like condition. We will start
(AIM 1) by determining the optimal oral agonist dosage and efficacy for DREADD activation in MPTP NHPs.
We will then (AIM 2) determine the long-term efficacy and safety of oral DREADD activation in MPTP NHPs,
with clinical/behavioral analyses emphasizing clinical benefits, and motor/non-motor side effects. We will use
PET in the same NHPs to monitor the stability of DREADD effects on STN circuits and follow up with
histological analysis to confirm DREADD distribution across STN circuits, to look for potential tissue damage
and to confirm striatal dopamine depletion due to the neurotoxin treatment. Finally (AIM 3) we will explore the
use of PET in the same NHPs as a noninvasive a gauge for the efficacy of the DREADD agonist alone or as
part of a combined therapy to guide dosage adjustment in future human studies. To enhance the rigor and
reproducibility, key UH3 experiments will be independently validated. Success in this work and its human
translation may be game-changing for the treatment of PD and other neurological/psychiatric disorders."
10875587,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Expressive social behaviors, including speech and music, are culturally transmitted from a tutor to a pupil.
Such learning depends on a pupil’s ability to integrate social and sensory cues provided by a tutor performing
the relevant behavior. Once learned, the underlying motor program must be coordinated with a range of innate
motor programs to generate holistic behaviors necessary to effective social signaling. The central hypothesis
that this proposal seeks to test is that the same brain circuitry that enables the pupil to integrate social and
sensory cues from an adult tutor also function in the adult to enable integration of the learned and innate
programs necessary to effective social signaling. In the past cycle, we discovered where neural signals
encoding social and sensory cues provided by a tutor are integrated in the pupil’s brain. Specifically, we
showed that neurons in a midbrain dopamine cell group (A11) in a juvenile songbird are selectively excited
during interactions with a singing adult male tutor, and that pairing song playback with the optogenetically-
triggered release of dopamine from A11 terminals in a sensorimotor cortical analogue (HVC) is sufficient to
drive song copying. Despite these important insights, exactly when and how tutor experience transforms
auditory and motor coding in HVC to facilitate vocal learning remains unknown. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will
use multiphoton (2p) longitudinal imaging, fiber photometry to test the hypothesis that tutor experience rapidly
strengthens the auditory and motor network in the pupil’s HVC. We will also use novel machine learning tools
for vocal analysis and optogenetic methods to test the idea that these sensorimotor changes enable HVC to
enhance the acoustic complexity of the pupil’s song, a first step in vocal copying. Our prior studies support the
idea that social and auditory cues provided by the tutor drive coincident DA release and auditory synaptic
activity in the pupil’s HVC, rapidly potentiating sensorimotor synapses in this region. Therefore, in Aim 2, we
will use ex vivo channelrhodopsin circuit-mapping to test the hypothesis that coincident DA release and
auditory synaptic actvity rapidly potentiates auditory synapses onto HVC interneurons, and that these effects
are strongest during juvenile sensitive periods for learning. Notably, the courtship display of the adult songbird
includes a learned song that is seamlessly coordinated with a variety of innate behaviors, including female-
directed calling, orientation, and pursuit. In Preliminary Studies, we found that lesions of A11’s axon terminals
in HVC of the adult male finch abolish female-directed singing without affecting his innate courtship
behaviors. In contrast, selectively ablating A11 cell bodies abolished all of the male’s courtship behaviors. In
Aim 3, we will map, monitor and manipulate A11’s projections to HVC and other motor centers to test the idea
that A11 acts as a central hub to enable the seamless and rapid coordination of learned and innate motor
programs in response to social cues provided by a nearby female."
10851752,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gene-augmentation therapy cannot address autosomal-dominant (ad) disorders, in which a defective protein is
expressed. To treat these mutations, such as the dominant form of rhodopsin (RHO)-related retinitis pigmentosa
RP (adRP), the only cure is to silence (RNAi) or edit the mutant allele. Precise CRISPR therapeutic editing is
predicted to be the best means of treating several dominant disorders, but molecular methods harnessing
CRISPR have been slow to develop because homology-directed repair (HDR) occurs only during the S and G2
phases of the cell cycle. To overcome these limitations, we have devised a novel method that capitalizes on
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heterozygosity to create a system applicable to multiple mutations,
referred to hereafter as SNP editing. To allow for immediate translation of editing strategies targeting human-
specific sequences, we rely on our recently engineered, humanized RHO adRP mouse model (RHOP347L). We
aim to assess and compare our proposed SNP editing with our previously established ablate-and-replace
strategy capable of overcoming challenges associated with the mutation-specific targeting of traditional CRISPR-
Cas9 ablation in dominantly-inherited conditions. SNP editing, on the other hand, relies on the ablation of the
mutant gene in an allele-specific manner via CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of heterozygous SNPs, leaving intact the
WT allele to support normal function. By testing these techniques on our novel mouse line, we will validate our
cost-effective SNP editing and ablate-and-replace strategies and evaluate the in vivo toxicity of SNP editing. Our
critical and innovative modification promises to significantly reduce costs by overcoming the need to engineer,
validate and obtain FDA-approval for all CRISPR components for each mutation (a major limitation of mutation-
specific CRISPR/Cas9. To conduct preclinical evaluation of this species-specific technology, we have replaced
the naïve mouse chromosomal Rho with human RHO mutant sequences (humanized RHO). If successful, the
viral vectors used in our therapeutic editing strategy could be directly reused in human trials for adRP without
further modification, thus avoiding FDA hurdles and accelerating translation of this research to a clinical setting."

Biology the initiator: Harnessing Reactive Oxygen Species for Biocompatible Polymerization
Project Summary
Vision: Disease or significant injury often results in rapid biochemical changes in the cellular environment.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are significantly increased extracellularly following heart attack, burn injury or
stroke, resulting in further cell death and tissue loss. What if these highly damaging radicals could be
harnessed for good? This project will investigate the opportunity of biocompatible, ROS-initiated,
polymerization to harness damaging extracellular radicals produced during significant disease or injury. ROS-
initiated polymerization could potentially provide therapeutic benefits following injury resulting from an antioxidant
effect, coupled with a synergistic benefit through the in-situ synthesis of a scaffold suitable for tissue
regeneration. This approach of therapeutic polymerization could provide a paradigm shift in the way we treat
diseases and injuries affected by oxidant damage where regeneration is required directly at the site of injury.
This project will investigate the complexities of biocompatible polymerization for therapy and how
biologically derived extracellular ROS can be used to directly initiate covalent polymerization.
Advances in synthetic materials, that can alter function based on biological changes, are of great interest to
generate materials which sense and adapt to different biological environments. These ‘smart’ materials have the
potential to facilitate controlled drug release for disease and injury or modify the mechanical or chemical
environment to alter cell signaling and improve regenerative capabilities. We hypothesize that ROS
upregulation following disease or injury can be utilized to initiate polymerization for therapy and
regeneration. This novel hypothesis will be tested by addressing three specific aims: (1) To synthesize
biocompatible peptide-based monomers suitable for targeting ischemic tissue and undergoing ROS initiated
polymerization, (2) to investigate the therapeutic benefit and regenerative support of extracellular ROS-initiated
polymerizable scaffolds and (3) to demonstrate efficacy as a therapeutic strategy in a rat model of cardiac
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Success in this exploratory study bodes broad application where ROS is
prevalent including heart disease, cancer, burn injuries and stroke among others."
10898013,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pneumonia is an important global health problem 1. Influenza A virus (IAV) leads to an estimated 500,000 deaths annually, and these numbers can be even higher during IAV pandemic years 2. A complication following infection with IAV is bacterial pneumonia, and this can lead to a more severe disease 3- 21. To survive a given infection hosts must be able to not only clear the pathogen, but also tolerate to the effects of the pathogen or the host response. The latter processes are referred to as disease tolerance. Normally, a balance between these two processes is reached, and the infection resolves 2223. My research lab has been at the forefront of exploring the concept of host disease tolerance in deadly complex respiratory infections 242322 • 25 • 26. We have shown that during pulmonary IAV/bacterial coinfection this balance between resistance and tolerance is disrupted causing increased lethality 22,24.
Regulated cell death (RCD) plays important roles in both resistance and tolerance to infection. Cell death can be broadly categorized as membrane permeable (e.g. necroptosis and pyroptosis) or membrane impermeable (e.g. apoptosis). During infection several different types of cell death can be induced each inducing a unique response. Macrophages are responsible for both resistance mechanisms such as coordination of the immune response, and they contribute to tolerance in the form of the tissue repair responses after damage. This proposal aims to bridge gaps in our current understanding of complex respiratory infections by investigating the role of Caspase-8. a key regulator of RCD. in relevant in vitro and in vivo models of IAV/bacterial coinfection. We will focus on understanding how Caspase-8 pathways in lung macrophages during IAV/bacterial coinfection contributes to resistance and tolerance. Our preliminary data has demonstrated that Caspase-8 deficiency in macrophages leads to increased host resistance at the expense of host tolerance in the early stages of coinfection. This is most likely due to increased necroptosis and anti-microbial responses. We hypothesize that during severe lung infections such as those that occur with bacterial infection following IAV infection macrophage cell death controlled by Caspase-8 plays an important role in regulating the balance between resistance and tolerance.
In this study we will determine the role that Caspase-8 in macrophages plays throughout the course of infection. We will use relevant in vitro models using human primary macrophages, as well as in vivo models. These studies will lay the foundation for future studies on understanding the impact of RCD in macrophages during complex pulmonary infections, which may ultimately lead to improved treatment options for patients with complex and severe lung infections."

10887533,"Project Summary
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains a complex unmet medical need because of its heterogeneity, poor
prognosis, and its potential to grow rapidly and/or metastasize especially following therapeutic intervention. The
response of TNBCs to various therapeutic interventions including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is generally
poor. Our published and ongoing studies have implicated the Ca2+ dependent membrane binding Annexin A6
(AnxA6) in a wide range of cellular functions including cell growth and motility that define tumor progression,
metastasis and chemo-resistance. We have now shown that AnxA6 is a tumor suppressor in TNBC and that the
pro-tumorigenic properties of low AnxA6 and the pro-invasive functions of high AnxA6 TNBC cells are mediated
at least in part, by AnxA6 modulated Ca2+ influx and activation of GRF2. Chronic treatment of AnxA6-low but
not AnxA6 high TNBC cells with TKIs leads to AnxA6 upregulation and accumulation of cholesterol in late
endosomes as a novel mechanism for acquired resistance of AnxA6 low TNBCs to these drugs. Furthermore,
reduced expression of AnxA6 is more relevant in TNBC compared to non-TNBC and may be used as a reliable
biomarker for response to chemotherapy and as an independent predictor of TNBC relapse after chemotherapy.
Interestingly, the reciprocal expression of AnxA6 and GRF2 is clinically relevant and semi-quantitative
assessment of the ratio of GRF2:AnxA6 can be used to delineate rapidly growing from highly invasive TNBCs.
Together, this suggests that AnxA6 plays a critical role in TNBC progression, metastasis and resistance to
therapeutic interventions, but the mechanisms underlying the chronic TKI induced reactivation and the pro-
invasive properties of AnxA6 in TNBC remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that the pro-invasive properties
of AnxA6 are mediated by extracellular and/or intracellular pools of AnxA6 via AnxA6-modulated interaction of
GRF2 with Rho GTPases; and that reactivation of AnxA6 expression is triggered by inhibition of Ca2+ mobilizing
RTKs via potent inhibition of Ca2+ entry channels and/or modification of specific histone marks. To test this we
will determine the mechanisms underlying TKI-induced reactivation of AnxA6 and the effects of AnxA6
reactivation in TNBC progression and metastasis in Aim 1; and in Aim 2, we will determine the mechanisms
underlying the pro-invasive properties of AnxA6 in basal-like TNBC. Data from this study will lead to a better
understanding of how TNBC cells circumvent the effects of chronic treatment with TKIs to become even more
aggressive and/or invasive, key attributes associated with TNBC patient mortality."

10888199,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) remain the leading causes of morbidity and
mortality in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and are exacerbated with longer duration of diabetes and time
outside goal glycemic range. Yet, T1D is a complex disease with pathophysiology that extends beyond -cell
injury and insulin deficiency to include insulin resistance (IR) and renal vascular resistance (RVR), factors that
accelerate CVD risk. We have shown that metformin improved peripheral insulin sensitivity (IS) and vascular
stiffness in youth with T1D on multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) or standard insulin pumps. However,
metformin’s effect on kidney and endothelial outcomes, and the effects of T1D technologies, with or without
metformin, on any CV or kidney outcome, remains unknown. Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems
combine an insulin pump, continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and control algorithm to modulate background
insulin delivery and decrease peripheral insulin exposure while improving time in target range and reducing
hypoglycemia. We hypothesize that AID systems, particularly when combined with metformin, may modulate
RVR and IS, thereby impacting cardiometabolic function. MANATEE-T1D is a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial of 4 months of metformin 2,000 mg daily in 30 youth aged 12-21 years with T1D on AID
systems vs. 15 control youth with T1D on MDI/CGM which will assess for changes in calculated RVR and gold
standard measures of whole-body and adipose IS, arterial stiffness, and endothelial function.
As an Instructor/Fellow in Pediatric Endocrinology with a strong publication and grant funding record, I am
establishing myself in the burgeoning field of T1D technologies by developing a unique niche studying the
effects of diabetes technologies, with or without combination pharmacological therapies, on IS and kidney and
cardiovascular complications in youth with T1D. A K23 would support the following research goals: 1) define
longitudinal differences in RVR by p-aminohippurate clearance and IS by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp
in youth with T1D on metformin and AID systems, 2) test for associations between RVR and IS, 3) evaluate for
in vivo and ex vivo endothelial function changes with metformin and AID systems. My career development plan
includes dedicated time to 1) train in the performance and analysis of gold standard translational research
methods for RVR, IS, arterial stiffness, and endothelial function, 2) gain experience conducting patient-oriented
research studies including study design and execution, data collection and analysis, and personnel
management, 3) work with a multidisciplinary team of experts in Endocrinology, Nephrology, and Biostatistics,
and 4) establish the foundation for an independent research career aimed at developing novel technologies
while leveraging existing therapies to mitigate the risk for DKD and CVD across the lifespan. My training
environment will be outstanding with mentorship from Drs. Kristen Nadeau (Professor, Ped. Endocrinology)
and Jessica Kendrick (Professor, Nephrology), experts in clinical trials, diabetes, IS, DKD, and CVD."

The goal of this project is to develop a clinical real-time spectroscopic photoacoustic/ultrasound (PAUS) system
for molecular guidance of interventional procedures through a partnership between UW and GE Research.
Recently, we proposed a new, fast-sweep concept for PA imaging. To put this concept into practice, we first
developed a unique, compact, diode-pumped, tunable (700 -900 nm) laser operating at very high (up to 1000
Hz) repetition rates and relatively low (~ 1 mJ) pulse energies, and a fiber-optic delivery system to sequentially
couple laser pulses into the imaging probe. In addition to US B-mode, and all other US modes, the system
simultaneously produces real-time (50 Hz) spectroscopic PA images, which were combined for the first time
for real-time PAUS imaging. A unique feature is automatic on-line laser-fluence compensation and motion
correction, enabling quantitative optical absorption spectroscopy at every image pixel. Spectroscopy can
identify substances opaque to US based on their molecular constituents (drugs/contrast agents), and quantify
tissue functional changes (e.g., blood oxygenation and its concentration) within the image; in addition,
manipulation with a needle is better visualized with PA.
UW will work with GE Research to integrate spectroscopic PAUS into a high-end US scanner to create a
clinical-grade PAUS system, and test whether it can improve interventional procedure guidance in general and,
particularly, in ethanol (EA) ablation therapies of recurrent thyroid tumors.
The prognosis for most people with thyroid cancer after primary treatment is very good, but the recurrence rate
or persistence can be up to 30%. If recurrent cancer is confirmed, image-guided nonsurgical procedures such
as EA or radio frequency ablation (RFA) are commonly used alternatives to more invasive procedures.
Although US helps position EA and RFA needles, on-line imaging of the ablative area and confirmation of
ablation remain difficult for US. When the recurrent nodule (especially the capillary network in it) is not entirely
treated, the cancer will return with possible metastasis. We hypothesize here that real-time spectroscopic
PAUS will improve the efficacy of ablation procedures and dramatically reduce procedure repetitions. If
successful in this initial stage, the project will move to a clinical trial to both guide and validate ablative therapies
and explore real-time spectroscopic PAUS for other interventional procedures.
SA1 will integrate our unique laser and scanning fiber-optic delivery system with a clinical GE US scanner for
real-time spectroscopic PAUS. Then, SA2 will develop real-time signal processing tools for motion correction
and fluence compensation and imaging protocols for spectroscopic PAUS. SA3 will focus on optimizing the
PAUS system using phantom and ex vivo studies. Finally, in SA4 the developed PAUS system will be used to
test the clinical applicability of PAUS guidance with three in vivo models, including small animal studies of
thyroid cancer, an animal model approximating human anatomy, and pilot measurements on human subjects."

Congenital defects are the leading cause of neonatal mortality, resulting in more infant deaths than the combined
adult death tolls of Alzheimer’s disease, strokes, diabetes, and influenza. Neural tube defects (NTDs), the second
most common category of human birth defects, arise when the neural tube fails to close properly during
neurulation. Globally, these defects are estimated to affect approximately 18.6 per 10,000 live births and the
prevalence of NTDs is 1–2 per 1,000 births in most regions of the US. There are approximately 2,300 NTD-
affected pregnancies in the US each year, whose lifetime medical costs are estimated to be $560,000 per child
or $1.68 billion per year nationwide. Despite intensive investigation for decades, relatively little is known about
the underlying NTD risk factors. It is generally accepted that NTDs are of a multi-factorial origin, having both
environmental and genetic factors that contribute to the malformation. Although it is established that
periconceptional use of folic acid (FA) prevents a significant percentage of the population burden of NTDs, the
mechanisms underlying those processes by which FA reduces NTD risk remains unknown. Importantly, there
are significant numbers of NTDs that are not preventable by FA supplementation, with these FA-resistant NTDs
occurring at an apparent baseline rate of 5 per 10,000 live births. Thus, NTDs remain a substantial public health
problem, and there is a critical need to understand the mechanisms underlying FA-resistant NTDs and to
develop novel intervention strategies targeting this population
To expand upon work performed in the initial funding period, our proposed line of study explores mechanisms
by which impairment of mitochondrial one carbon metabolism causes NTDs and how our proposed interventions
successfully restore proper NTC. Simultaneously, we are testing the efficacy and investigating mechanisms by
which glycine supplementation rescues these FA-resistant defects. Establishing these mechanisms and relating
them to actual human NTD variants may eventually allow us to utilize our proposed intervention strategies to
prevent previously unpreventable birth defects by informing public health policy or precision medicine strategies,
thus reducing the significant negative health burden of these debilitating defects on affected families and the
public."

During the previous funding cycle, our research focused on studies related to mechanism(s) of transformation
by FLT3ITD and oncogenic KIT in myeloid leukemia’s including in AMLs and MPNs. We identified novel signaling
pathways downstream from these oncogenes that function individually as well as in cooperation with mutations
in epigenetic regulators such as TET2 and DNMT3A. The focus of this competitive renewal application involves
a better understanding of the role of the PI3Kinase/c-Myc/GCN2 pathway as well as the p38α MAPK pathway in
driving TET2 mediated clonal hematopoiesis (CH) in pre-leukemic cells and its cooperation with FLT3ITD driven
frank AML. We recently provided experimental evidence supporting the notion that exposure of HSCPs with
somatic TET2 (ten-eleven translocation 2, one of the most frequently mutated genes in individuals exhibiting CH)
mutations to acute/chronic infection or hyperglycemia (HG), as noted in patients with diabetes and obesity,
profoundly accelerates the development of CH and leukemia. We showed that this is in part due to enhanced
production of inflammatory cytokines by mutant HSCPs, which in a feed-forward loop drive the survival,
expansion and self-renewal of mutant HSCPs but induce apoptosis and differentiation in normal HSCPs.
However, the signaling mechanism(s) downstream from these mutations in HSCPs, which contribute to their
enhanced cellular competitiveness, are not known and the main focus of this proposal. Identifying these
pathways would allow us to therapeutically target these mutant cells to mitigate their competitiveness thereby
preventing or mitigating CH, development of leukemia and CVD. We performed an unbiased RNAseq analysis
on WT and Tet2 KO HSCPs and identified several dysregulated signaling pathways in Tet2 KO HSCPs
compared to WT. Here, we have focused our efforts on the PI3Kinase/c-Myc/GCN2 and the p38 MAPK pathway.
We show that these pathways provide competitive advantage to Tet2 mutant HSCPs but not WT HSCPs.
Inhibition of these pathways in Tet2 KO HSCPs, reverses and rescues, a significant number of cellular
competitive advantages associated with these cells. We will define the role of these pathways in more detail.
Furthermore, we will identify the mechanism(s) by which these pathways alter the function of downstream
signals."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive decline and
an accumulation of amyloid pathology. A strong genetically-driven innate immune component is thought to play
a pathogenic role in AD, implicating a central role for microglial dysfunction. Microglia are long-lived resident
innate immune cells in the central nervous system. Activation of their immune and metabolic pathways lead to
innate immune memory (IIM), a functional reprogramming process in which the response to an initial stimulus
shapes long-lasting epigenetic modifications which inform the response to subsequent stimuli. IIM may result in
enhanced activation (training) or suppression (tolerance) based on the identity of the initial inflammatory
stimulus. IIM has been shown to alter pathology in AD mouse models, as a consequence of a sustained alteration
in microglial functioning. Several common AD risk variants, including CD33, converge to suppress microglial
activation, by decreasing inflammatory signaling or increasing its inhibition. Accordingly, my overall hypothesis
is that altered microglial IIM as a result of suppressive genetic AD risk variants is a critical mechanism underlying
the observed microglial dysfunction in AD. More specifically, I hypothesize that the suppressive CD33 AD-risk
variant will reduce epigenetic and metabolic rewiring that occurs upon cellular activation, impairing microglial
IIM. This sustained alteration of responsiveness at the epigenetic level may contribute to microglial failure as a
pathogenic mechanism in AD. To address these hypotheses, I propose to examine the mechanisms of human
microglial IIM in response to AD associated inflammatory stimuli, including amyloid and tau, and the effect of the
CD33 risk variant on this imprinting process. In Aim 1, I will investigate human microglial IIM phenotypic
outcomes in HMC3s (a human microglial cell line) edited with CRISPR to carry the CD33 AD risk allele. I will test
whether a range of AD-associated inflammatory stimuli produce trained or tolerized IIM responses, and how
CD33 genotype affects these outcomes. In Aim 2, I will investigate the epigenetic and metabolic mechanisms
underlying IIM in HMC3s carrying the CD33 risk or protective alleles. These studies will provide mechanistic
insight into longitudinal interactions between microglia and local brain pathology, as well as how the CD33 risk
variant mediates microglial dysfunction and ultimately AD susceptibility. Importantly, they will also advance our
understanding of IIM in human microglia, of which little is known, and the IIM phenotypes they adopt in response
to AD pathologies. Their successful conclusion may thus open novel avenues for the development of potential
therapeutics to target microglial dysregulation in AD, and to ultimately improve patient outcomes."

Particulate matter air pollution <2.5µm (PM2.5) is the leading environmental risk factor globally, contributing more
to global mortality than AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and wars/famines combined. The health risks associated
with PM2.5 are predominantly from cardiovascular (CV) causes, with data supporting a major public health impact
due to disorders such as type 2 diabetes. Building on the substantial successes of our research program, that in
large part have provided the foundational basis for our understanding of mechanisms of PM2.5-induced
cardiometabolic disorders, we propose an innovative framework of translational investigations. Our new data
provide compelling links between PM2.5 exposure and circadian rhythm (CR) disruption through epigenetic
reprogramming, resulting in metabolic dysfunction and insulin resistance. In accordance with the NIEHS
Translational Research Framework, we propose an ambitious plan encompassing 3 goals over 8 years that will
encompass harmonized studies involving concentrated ambient PM2.5 exposures (animal) and human
intervention trials across the ambient exposure spectrum, predicated and supported by results from genome
wide association and mendelian randomization approaches, that will identify pathways of air pollution mediated
CV risk. Leveraging on-going translational clinical trials of air pollution reduction using personalized strategies in
vulnerable populations in Beijing, and through one new study involving mitigation of air pollution (ITS-MY-AIR),
we will evaluate the impact of exposure reduction on CR disruption/sleep and metabolic endpoints. Collectively,
results from this project will help shed important new light on air pollution, its impact on CR and cardiometabolic
disorders and provide influential data on protective effects of personal intervention strategies, that together could
change public health policy."
10837727,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The Microbiota-Diet-Host interactions are critical to the balance of health and disease. Understanding
this axis will be important to the development of nutritional precision medicine. Although there are some
important discoveries where microbes make molecules that dramatically affect health, most of the molecules
produced by microbiota still remain structurally uncharacterized. In addition, even when a molecule is known
and the activity is known, this knowledge tends to be buried in papers and there is not a systematic
organization of this knowledge that can be readily leveraged by data scientists. This prevents a deep
mechanistic understanding of the microbiome. The goal of PAR-21-253 to which this application is applying to
and the accompanying RFA (RFA-DK-21-014) is to build a microbial metabolite knowledgebase that can be
used by the larger scientific community. In order to build the knowledgebase, the R01’s funded under PAR-21-
253 are discovery grants that will provide the knowledge of new microbial metabolites and their bioactivities.
This proposal will 1) obtain MS/MS signatures for up to 5,000,000 molecules synthesized, using
combinatorial/diversity driven synthesis, using diet and host precursors that are accessible to human
microbiota. The synthesis is biased towards common bio-transformations. This will be the largest
metabolomics reference data set ever assembled, even when all public and non-public libraries are combined;
2) we will use our big data mining strategies, especially our mass spectrometry search tools, to not only
discover what molecules are made by microbes, but also understand phenotype, disease, organ/tissue/biofluid,
food associations; 3) the newly discovered microbial molecules that are up or down regulated in inflammatory
bowel disease (and other gut metabolic disorders) will be further screened in cell-based assays and colitis
animal studies to understand the biological effects of the newly discovered microbial metabolites; 4) we will
transfer all the knowledge obtained by this R01 to the knowledgebase that will be created by the
accompanying RFA.
 The PIs and Co-Is are well suited to help build the proposed knowledge base, due to their expertise in
microbial metabolomics (Dorrestein), synthesis (Dorrestein, Siegel), microbiome (Dorrestein, Knight,
Raffatellu), data science (Dorrestein, Knight) and having a track record of doing very large projects and share
newly discovered knowledge publicly for the benefit of the community – generally made available years before
any publication (Dorrestein, Knight)."
10893547,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Multiple myeloma (MM) affects ~35,000 adult patients in the United States and causes ~12,000 deaths each
year. Novel immunomodulatory drugs and effective multidrug combinations have improved the prognosis for
patients, but the vast majority of patients eventually relapse. Even among patients achieve a complete
response, ~25% progress within 2 years. Most MM relapses can be attributed to the persistence of measurable
(minimal) residual disease (MRD). MRD status has emerged as one of the most important prognostic markers,
has therapeutic implications, and is incorporated in the International Myeloma Working Group response criteria
for therapeutic response assessment. The gold standard of MRD assessment includes multiparameter flow
cytometry and next-generation sequencing (NGS) based on bone marrow aspirates. However, evaluation of
MRD using only bone marrow aspirates is prone to false-negatives due to patchy disease involvement,
hemodilution of bone aspirate, and extramedullary disease. In addition, bone marrow biopsy is an invasive
procedure, hence cannot be performed frequently to monitor MRD. Positron emission tomography/computed
tomography (PET/CT) is complementary to bone marrow assessment although gaps remain. We have shown
that the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), a stable epigenetic marks generated from active DNA
demethylation, in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) could be complementary to PET/CT and was associated with
overall survival of patients with MM. Here we propose to apply the highly sensitive mapping of genome-wide
5hmC in cfDNA to identify the optimal combination of serial cfDNA-based 5hmC markers with PET/CT for
detecting emergence of MRD. Our central hypothesis is that altered 5hmC signatures in cfDNA are associated
with clinically detectable disease by PET/CT and/or NGS, thus offering opportunities for accurate yet less
invasive approaches to complement bone marrow-based MRD assessment by NGS. Specifically, we propose
to identify 5hmC in cfDNA associated with MRD-positivity (Aim 1), determine cfDNA-based temporal dynamics
of 5hmC and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT changes associated with MRD (Aim 2), and evaluate
performance of different MRD modalities in real-world patients (Aim 3). To address these aims, we have
assembled an interdisciplinary team with extensive and complementary expertise. The study leverages the
established resources of the UChicago Myeloma Epidemiology Study and our leadership in three clinical trials
with banked serial blood samples, bone marrow-paired peripheral blood, and known MRD status by NGS. The
knowledge gained from this application may improve clinical utilization of MRD in clinical decision making by
proper combination of serial MRD assessments (i.e., cfDNA, PET/CT, and bone marrow) for sensitive tracking
of MRD as well as provide novel insights into the epigenetic contribution to MM progression. Identifying
patients at high risk of progression after successful treatment will allow for timely implementation of additional
therapeutic strategies that may ultimately reduce morbidity and mortality among MM patients."
10877892,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Viruses have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to hijack host cellular machinery. For their part,
hosts have developed their own intricate defense systems. Defining how these opposing strategies
have co-evolved increases our understanding of infectious diseases and provides new opportunities to
discover unexplored areas of biology. Our understanding of host cellular defense systems has been
limited due to genetic redundancy in host genomes. A further complication is that successful pathogens
are able to inactivate host antiviral networks during infection. We have recently established a new
genetic screening platform that overcomes these roadblocks. First, we bypass genetic redundancy in
host genomes through a gain of function screen that identifies antiviral genes. Second, we use both
virulent and attenuated strains of viruses in our screening pipeline. Importantly, these attenuated
viruses have deletions or mutations in critical, yet poorly understood, immune evasion proteins that
antagonize host antiviral restriction factors. We predict that the avirulent strains of these viruses will
become sensitive to restriction factors that have otherwise defied molecular identification. Using this
strategy, one project will be to identify ancient antiviral genes that reveal unappreciated areas of host-
pathogen conflict. For example, we are unmasking how the influenza immune evasion protein, NS1
orchestrates a complex, multifaceted rewiring of host antiviral networks using comparative screens with
wild-type and NS1-deficient viruses. We are extending these studies to other virulent-attenuated virus
pairings as well. Another project takes newly identified antiviral molecules that inhibit disparate virus
families and define the molecular mechanism underlying viral inhibition. Here, we focus on the JADE
family of proteins that regulate histone acetylation. We aim to uncover functional redundancy in the
JADE family and to determine if it assembles a concerted antiviral epigenetic program. Another project
is to leverage newly identified host-pathogen conflicts to discover the physiological functions of host-
proteins that are poorly understood. In this regard, we are focusing on the CD300 family of receptor
proteins. CD300 genes are undergoing rapid positive selection, yet their physiological function remains
largely unexplored. We previously demonstrated that CD300lf is a protein receptor for murine norovirus.
We will employ the biochemical, genetic, and cellular tools we developed for studying norovirus-CD300
interactions to define the physiological ligands of CD300 receptors. Determining the ligands for these
orphan receptors will provide functional insight into these rapidly evolving proteins. Taken together, we
plot a road map for discovering new host-pathogen interfaces, defining their molecular interactions
during host defense, and how this relates to the physiological functions of these proteins and pathways."
10875550,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In light of the opioid crises, minimizing postoperative pain and postoperative opioid requirements to reduce
chronic opioid dependency among surgical patients have become major concerns for surgeons and
anesthesiologists. Effective intraoperative nociception control can mitigate these concerns. Unfortunately,
existing nociceptive monitoring tools use indicators that are inherently susceptible to intraoperative influences.
Monitoring these indicators often lead to suboptimal intraoperative opioid administration, since there is no way
to account for whether these measures are being influenced by nociception or numerous other intraoperative
factors such as blood loss, anesthetic drugs and antihypertensives. Therefore, improved methods to monitor
surgical nociception are clearly needed. In short, currently available nociceptive monitors measure unreliable
indicators and predispose surgical patients to suboptimal opioid dosing administration leading to ineffective
intraoperative control. The consequences for surgical patients can be significant, since increased postoperative
pain and opioid requirements is associated with increased incidence of opioid dependency. This project
proposes to develop a state-of-the-art sensors, algorithms, and prospective observational data to construct an
integrated measure of nociceptive control based on autonomic (EDA) and neurophysiologic markers of arousal
and nociception (EEG-based arousal and opioid signatures)."

Although ablation to isolate pulmonary vein (PV) triggers has revolutionized atrial fibrillation (AF) management,
performing effective AF ablation remains challenging. The procedure remains limited by targeting of ill-defined
substrates, a 2-6% risk of major complications and limited success (single procedure 5-year success as low as
17-56%; 63-81% after the last ablation). A major recommendation of a recent NHLBI-sponsored report on the
research needs and priorities for AF catheter ablation was to study how cardiac structure affects AF ablation
success. There is a clear unmet need for non-invasive imaging tools to aid in improved patient selection,
anatomic targeting and personalization of ablation or medical therapies. Our team has developed novel
computational imaging (radiomics) methods to analyze cardiac computed tomography (CT) scans that were
shown to predict the risk of recurrent AF post-ablation (AUC=0.84, N=167). These approaches included novel
morphologic, fractal and atlas based features that teased out differences between PVs and the left atrial
appendage (LAA), solely from analyses of CT scans. We propose to build upon our preliminary data using
radiomic (computer extracted) features from radiographic images to use supervised and unsupervised machine
learning methods that can analyze digitized radiographic and electro-anatomic images from the left atrium (LA)
and PVs in over 2000 patients from two large AF ablation centers (Cleveland Clinic, Vanderbilt). Our project
will focus on tackling the following main objectives: 1) Identify, evaluate and validate radiomic features and
imaging-clinical nomograms predictive of recurrent AF after ablation; 2) Identify and validate regional radiomic
sites predictive of post-ablation AF recurrence with the goal of identifying personalized targets for patients
undergoing AF ablation; and 3) Identify biological correlates of radiomic features to understand the
arrhythmogenic mechanisms underlying anatomic susceptibility to recurrent AF, using genomic analyses. Our
3 aims will test the following hypotheses: 1) Radiographic imaging can detect anatomic features that predict AF
recurrence after ablation; 2) Regional radiomic features can predict sites that can be considered for additional
ablation; and 3) Radiomic morphologic features are correlated with electroanatomic features and genomic
variants associated with AF susceptibility. Tools developed will enable integration of radiographic and clinical
data that may lead to improved patient selection, anatomic targeting and personalization of ablation or medical
therapies. Successful project completion will yield a novel artificial intelligence-based imaging platform that can
be tested for personalized targeting of AF ablation, as well as insights into the biologic basis of AF."

Dr. Yaffe's background and accomplishments make her ideally positioned for the proposed R35 Leadership
Award in ADRD focusing on the AD/ADRD Research Implementation Milestones for population studies,
precision medicine and health disparities. Over the past 20 years, the PI and her team have led a research
program in the epidemiology of ADRD. Within this broad theme, Dr. Yaffe has focused on studies aimed at
identifying risk factors, particularly those that are modifiable (a key component of the exposome), for pre-
clinical cognitive decline and ADRD. Her team has led seminal investigations on physical activity, sleep quality,
cardiovascular risk factors, traumatic brain injury and other key risk factors. In order to achieve the next
platform of research and training in line with the Population Studies Milestone, the team will create an exciting
multidisciplinary program entitled, the UCSF Population Based Research for Alzheimer's Innovation or Pop-
BRAIN. Dr. Yaffe has assembled an outstanding multidisciplinary leadership group to advance ADRD
population health along a highly innovative and impactful roadmap for discovery and next generation of
researchers' development. The R35 mechanism is an ideal platform to enhance Dr. Yaffe's previous line of
investigation in population health but also to pivot to greater emphasis on three themes that are nicely aligned
with Milestone 1.B: 1) a life-course approach to risk factors and novel analytic approaches to studying the life-
course exposome, 2) emphasis on diverse populations and how the exposome and life-course exposures may
differ across groups (by race/ethnicity and sex) and provide insight into risk mechanisms and 3) and the
relatively unexplored inter-relationship of the exposome, social determinants of health and biological pathways
of ADRD. We will conduct these studies using established and novel analytic approaches for investigation in
several cohorts that the investigators lead or have extensive experience with. Implementation of this innovative
line of investigation will highlight new strategies for prevention, underscore the underpinnings for health
disparities in risk of ADRD and offer new insights to the life-course etiology of ADRD. In an equally important
mission, the Pop-BRAIN program will foster the careers of junior investigators from a variety of disciplines
focused on population health for ADRD. This will involve new resources as well as leveraging and harmonizing
existing but disparate programs at UCSF. The program will provide mentoring, didactics, research design and
biostatistics guidance, pilot funding and career development activities across several departments in a unified
hub dedicated to population health. Due to the caliber of her achievements and deep commitment to improving
public health through rigorous scientific inquiry and developing the next generation of investigators, Dr. Yaffe
and her Pop-BRAIN multidisciplinary team of experts are in an ideal position to embrace a Leadership Award
and deliver on the Milestone in Population Health."
10766806,"Rotaviruses (RVs) continue to be a leading cause of infantile gastroenteritis and a significant global disease burden despite four approved vaccines. RV particles are icosahedral non-enveloped with a complex architecture composed of three concentric protein shells encapsidating 11 segments of dsRNA, which code for six structural (VPs) and six non-structural proteins (NSPs). With the atomic structure of VP3, which we recently determined, the atomic details of all the RV capsid proteins are known as the structural determinants required for glycan-mediated cell attachment and conformational changes the capsid undergoes during endosomal entry. However, the structural underpinnings of the fascinating stages in RV replication following cell entry, from endogenous transcription and release of capped nascent transcripts to the final stages of how RVs acquire their infectious form, remain unclear. From our recent exciting discoveries on the RV capping enzyme VP3, multifunctional NSP2, and the membrane-associated glycoprotein NSP4, which play critical roles in key events in RV replication and morphogenesis, we now propose novel hypothesis-driven experiments to provide unprecedented mechanistic details underlying these events in RV-infected cells. In probing these complex molecular events, we will make use of remarkable new technological advances in high-resolution cryo-EM imaging, single-particle and focused sub-particle refinement and reconstruction pipelines, cellular cryo-ET with cryo-FIB-SEM-CLEM and sub-tomogram reconstructions, combined with crystallography and complementary biophysical and cell-based techniques such as reverse genetics, and gene silencing. The focus of Aim 1 is on endogenous transcription. Based on our atomic structure of the capping enzyme VP3, we will investigate the structural basis of how VP3, with its unique multidomain tetrameric organization, integrates four essential enzymatic activities for capping, how transcripts traverse through the multiple domains for capping, and how VP3 caps the nascent transcript exiting from VP1 within the actively transcribing double-layered particles (DLPs). In Aim 2, our focus is to investigate structure-based mechanisms of how the RNA-binding protein NSP2 with multiple enzymatic activities performs dual functions, based on hypotheses from our recent studies, first, in trafficking RV proteins and capped mRNAs from the cytoplasm into the viroplasm, and second, as a scaffolding protein in regulating the formation of replication intermediates and core assembly. In Aim 3, our focus is on the final stages of RV morphogenesis. Exploiting our successful expression and purification of the first functionally active NSP4, we will determine its atomic structure and investigate the structural basis of how NSP4 facilitates the 'budding' of assembling DLPs from the viroplasm, inhibits their endogenous transcription and incorporates VP4 spikes onto DLPs to form transiently enveloped particles (TEPs), and determine the structure of the TEP. We expect our studies will provide novel insights into morphogenetic pathways in a complex virus and provide a roadmap for a structure-based understanding of morphogenetic pathways in other viral systems."
10907681,"ABSTRACT: The locus coeruleus (LC) is considered to be one of the earliest regions accumulating
hyperphosphorylated tau. The first pretangle deposits occur in young adulthood, and by age 40 the LC is
affected in nearly every case at autopsy. These tau aggregates occur before the earliest cortical involvement in
the entorhinal cortex around age 50, from where they progress to limbic and other cortical regions. The fact
that this highly predictable anatomic pattern of pathology progression occurs along regions that are connected
suggests that LC-brain connectivity is one of the mechanisms contributing to the earliest vulnerability of
accumulation and propagation of tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The LC has widespread projections to the
cortex enabling the integration and coordination of communication between segregated regions. However,
even though, tau is omnipresent in the LC of every person above age 40, not everyone will head down to an
irreversible AD path. Thus, to ensure that prevention trials are more effective in these early stages, it will be
critical to distinguish individuals at risk of AD versus those who remain resilient in the face of pathology. To
overcome this barrier, we need to discern LC large-scale network architectural patterns associated with AD
vulnerability versus those conferring resiliency to AD. This will provide a deeper understanding of network
changes related to healthy or pathological aging, improve early detection and contribute to identifying
individuals at-risk for inclusion in prevention trials. The overall goal of this proposal is to characterize and
understand the biological background of LC's specific vulnerability by identifying specific LC- network patterns
contributing to vulnerability to AD versus those that confer resiliency, and map associated genetic traits. We
hypothesize that associating the selective degradation of the LC's capacity to integrate brain networks with AD
pathology will uncover vulnerable and resilient LC-cortical network architectural layouts, which will be
associated with AD-related cognitive decline or resiliency, respectively. To achieve this, we will generate multi-
modal LC tau-vulnerable clusters by utilizing a unique large 7T fMRI adult lifespan brainstem cohort with
novel plasma AD-biomarker data. The architecture of networks emerging from LC clusters will be examined in
this 7T fMRI dataset and in two large-scale NIA-funded, rich multi-modal longitudinal datasets, the Harvard
Aging Brain Study and ADNI. We will examine the following aims: 1) To identify the anatomic vulnerability to
tau along the rostro-caudal axis of the LC and its association with age, sex and APOE; 2) To relate AD
pathology to patterns of LC-cortical network architecture, and identify at-risk versus resilient patterns; 3) To
characterize the genetic brain transcriptome of tau spreading profiles associated with at-risk and resilient LC-
cortical network patterns. The proposed research is innovative and can result in a significant breakthrough for
the field by shifting detection to earlier time points and providing new enrollment strategies or targets for
therapeutic approaches administered earlier in the disease trajectory, when brain damage is not yet irreversible."
10663519,"Project Summary: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic, neuropsychiatric illness characterized by frequent
relapses, driven in part by anxiety during abstinence. Identifying the neural mechanisms that underlie anxiety
during abstinence may identify targets for novel treatments. The aims in this proposal will train Dr. Srivastava
to be uniquely qualified to conduct this research. While pursuing this line of research under the guidance of
mentors who are recognized experts in clinical trials in substance use disorders and co-occurring psychiatric
illness (Frances Levin, MD), fMRI methodology (Gaurav Patel, MD, PhD), and addiction neuroscience and
psychophysiology (Nasir Naqvi, MD, PhD), Dr. Srivastava will engage in a comprehensive training program in
the following areas: 1) learning clinical trials methodology to conduct mechanistic research in AUD and co-
occurring psychiatric illnesses, 2) fMRI methodology, 3) addiction neuroscience and psychophysiology, and 4)
grant writing and management skills. This training will build upon Dr. Srivastava’s training as an addiction
psychiatrist who has significant experience treating AUD but relatively little experience in clinical research. To
facilitate this training, Dr. Srivastava will investigate how alterations in anxiety circuitry involving the bed
nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), anterior insula (AI) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) may
underlie anxiety during abstinence from alcohol and how this circuitry might change as a function of sustained
abstinence. This proposal combines 1) participants with AUD stabilized on disulfiram to facilitate abstinence,
2) functional MRI (fMRI) experiments that probe neural activity related to anxiety, and 3) psychophysiological
markers of stress and anxiety. AI-BNST and AI-DLPFC connectivity will be investigated using resting state
functional connectivity (RSFC), and AI, BNST, and DLPFC activations will be investigated using a threat
anticipation task. The fMRI studies will be performed between 1-2 weeks after stabilization on disulfiram order
to capture early abstinence and then after 12 weeks of treatment, with the goal of determining 1) if anxiety
circuit connectivity and task-evoked activation during unpredictable threat anticipation in early abstinent AUD
participants differ from healthy control participants, 2) if anxiety circuit connectivity and task-evoked activation
correlate with self-report measures of state anxiety during early abstinence, 3) if anxiety circuit connectivity and
task-evoked activation change over the course of abstinence, and 4) if changes over the course of abstinence
in anxiety circuit connectivity and task-evoked activation correlate with changes in self-report measures of state
anxiety. Thus, the K23 award will support an innovative and clinically relevant program of patient-oriented
research while training Dr. Srivastava in critical skills that will ensure his development into an independent
translational researcher who leads future studies on mechanisms underlying abstinence in AUD and co-
occurring psychiatric illnesses."
10912069,"SUMMARY
High-throughput connectomics is needed to generate the TB-, PB- and EB-scale wiring diagrams of mammalian
brains, but is limited to the few research institutes (e.g., Janelia, Allen, Max Planck) with sufﬁcient infrastructure.
As resource-rich as these institutes are, none are able to do a whole brain at nanometer scale on their own. The
failure to broaden participation to a larger community is an obstacle to scaling connectomics. We propose a new
and more affordable imaging strategy that will allow many more teams to engage in connectomics.
High-speed electron microscopes for connectomics – e.g., multibeam SEMs – are rare and prohibitively ex-
pensive. More common single-beam SEMs have sufﬁciently high spatial resolution, but are prohibitively slow
for connectomics. We plan to increase the speed of single-beam SEM systems to the speed of multibeam
SEMs without substantially increasing cost. Our strategy adds artiﬁcial intelligence to SEM architecture to re-
duce the number and dwell time of pixels that need to be imaged at high-resolution without adversely affecting
“segmentability”. With new software and standard computer hardware, we can turn single-beam SEMs into intel-
ligent, powerful devices at negligible cost. We demonstrated a proof-of-concept of a smart scanning system that
we engineered into a single-beam SEM. The modiﬁed SEM acquires a low-resolution/low-dwell time image of a
brain slice at high speed. It then uses ultrafast ML algorithms to extract most of the wiring from these images,
while at the same time identifying in real time those salient pixels that should be rescanned to improve signal-to
noise in the ﬁnal wiring diagram. We have achieved >10-fold speedup in image acquisition, and plan to increase
the rate signiﬁcantly more.
A signiﬁcant scale-up in the rate of connectomics demands comparable improvements in image processing
(stitching, alignment, and segmentation). We have built computationally more efﬁcient methods for aligning and
segmenting connectome datasets. We will integrate these methods into a cloud-based platform that will allow
researchers without signiﬁcant computational infrastructure or expertise to process connectomics datasets. All
data products and capabilities will be publicly accessible through BossDB.
In summary, this integrated research program will scale connectomics to a much larger neuroscience
community."

nicotine and “mature” users with higher concentrations of nicotine, mainly in the freebase form, to maintain
dependence. They are now following the same playbook for oral nicotine pouches (ONPs), manipulating the
nicotine dimensions of concentration and form, and more recently have begun manipulating isomer
composition through the use of synthetic nicotine. While ONPs may have promise as a less harmful alternative
for smokers and ST users who completely switch, the potential risk for ONP uptake among young new users is
concerning. The overall integrative theme of The Ohio State University Tobacco Center for Regulatory Science
is: “Flipping the Script”: Using the Industry's Nicotine Playbook to Maximize Public Health. Just as the
tobacco industry manipulates nicotine to create ONPs that appeal to young people, with the evidence produced
by Project 2 (P2), we posit that the FDA can regulate the nicotine dimensions in ONPs, making them
unappealing to new users while still providing smokers and ST users a less harmful but appealing and satisfying
alternative. P2 will inform regulations that position ONPs as a public health benefit rather than a threat by
identifying the characteristics of nicotine that best support switching to ONPs and evaluating corresponding
changes to the oral microbiome among adult smokers and ST users. In Phase 1, using a double-blind, cross-
over design, exclusive smokers (n=80) and ST users (n=80) will be randomized to high or low nicotine
concentration, and then engage in 5 single-product laboratory use sessions of their usual brand and 4 ONPs
(random order) that range in freebase fraction (low, high) and isomer (racemic, >99% S-nicotine). Outcomes
include plasma nicotine pharmacokinetics, subjective effects, and behavioral economic demand indicies. In
Phase 2, the same participants, after a 1-week usual brand control period, will substitute a randomly assigned
ONP for their usual brand for 4 weeks. Study outcomes include use behaviors, including complete switching,
measured via ecological momentary assessment and biochemically confirmed (anatabine and anabasine), count
of unused ONPs, subjective effects, behavioral economic demand indices, and oral microbiome assessment. P2
is significant and innovative because it uses a mix of tightly controlled in-lab procedures and ad libitum,
naturalistic use of commercial tobacco products to assess how nicotine concentration, form, and isomer affect
the addiction potential and health effects of ONPs. This is the first study of the combined nicotine dimensions
with the intent of facilitating switching from cigarettes and ST to ONPs without increasing youth uptake. P2
addresses the FDA priority areas of Addiction, Product Composition & Design, Toxicity, Behavior, and Health
Effects, and will inform ONP nicotine regulations designed to foster complete switching for established smokers
and ST users."
10929365,"SUMMARY – PROJECT 3
Oral nicotine pouches (ONPs) emerged in the U.S. in 2016, ONP brands rapidly proliferated, and sales are
skyrocketing. ONPs are representative of a shift by the tobacco industry to marketing non-tobacco nicotine
products as alternatives to cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (ST), and even e-cigarettes (ECs). Nicotine is the
driver of use and dependence, and the industry continuously manipulates nicotine dimensions to maximize
appeal to consumers. Packaging is a primary marketing vehicle to increase product appeal, and ONP packaging
prominently emphasizes nicotine concentration (e.g., 3 mg, 6 mg) and source claims (e.g., “tobacco free”) as
a marketing tool. Understanding how these packaging features communicating nicotine dimensions affect the
appeal of ONPs in young adult non-users versus adult tobacco users is critical to inform regulations for ONPs
and other nicotine products using similar marketing. Project 3 of the Ohio State University Tobacco Center of
Regulatory Science (OSU-TCORS) will examine how nicotine concentration and source claims on ONP
packaging affect the appeal of ONPs and how these features affect preferences for ONPs relative to ECs,
cigarettes, ST, and other products in young non-tobacco users versus adult tobacco users. The Specific Aims
are to: 1) Examine the effects of nicotine concentration and source claims on visual and cognitive engagement
with ONP packaging using laboratory-based psychophysiological assessment. 2) Examine the effects of nicotine
concentration and source claims on ONP perceptions, behavioral intentions, and ONP trial. 3) Investigate the
effects of nicotine concentration and source claims on ONP preferences relative to ECs, cigarettes, ST, and
other tobacco products. Project 3 includes 2 complementary studies to accomplish these aims. Study 1 (Aims
1 and 2) is a 2 (young adult susceptible non-user, adult tobacco user) x 3 (labelled nicotine concentration: none,
low, high) x 3 (source claim: none, “tobacco free,” “synthetic”) human laboratory experiment to examine how
nicotine concentration and source claims affect engagement with ONP packaging using psychophysiological
measures, ONP appeal, risk perceptions and use intentions, and a behavioral lapse task assessing ONP trial.
Study 2 (Aim 3) is a discrete choice experiment with a national sample of young adult susceptible non-users and
adult tobacco users to assess the effects of nicotine concentration and source claims on ONP preferences
relative to ECs, cigarettes, ST, and other products. Project 3 addresses the Marketing Influences and Behavior
FDA tobacco regulatory science domains. Project 3 is significant and innovative because it will be one of the
first studies to generate evidence to inform potential regulation of packaging features communicating nicotine
concentration and nicotine source claims based on their differential effects in young adult non-users versus adult
tobacco users. Through integration with Projects 1, 2, and 4, the OSU-TCORS will provide evidence to guide
an overall regulatory strategy targeting nicotine dimensions for ONPs, ECs, and other novel products."
10929372,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 4
The tobacco product landscape changed drastically in the last decade with the proliferation of non-combustible
tobacco products like e-cigarettes (ECs) and new oral nicotine pouches (ONPs). ECs are the most used tobacco
product among adolescents and young adults (AYA) and ONP sales are climbing rapidly. The tobacco industry
has a long history of manipulating three dimensions of nicotine (concentration, form, and isomer) to improve
a product's sensory experience and nicotine delivery. Additionally, the industry has a history of creating a product
graduation strategy whereby some products (defined along their nicotine dimensions) are “starter” for novice
users and others are “robust” for longer-term users. Further, the tobacco industry pairs their products with specific
marketing strategies designed to increase product appeal. The goal of Project 4 (P4) is to provide a
comprehensive understanding of how industry strategies across the nicotine dimensions impact product
perceptions, use behaviors, and dependence among AYA in the natural environment. Participants will be a
national sample of recent initiators (within 6 months) of ECs and ONPs (N = 2000; ages 13-23). We will observe
trends among these AYAs overall, and also among priority populations the tobacco industry has historically
targeted including those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ+), those with mental
health disorders, and rural residents. Participants will be followed over a 2-year period; this prospective
observational study will consist of surveys every 6 months, paired with 3 ecological momentary assessment
(EMA) bursts, to characterize perceptions, use, and marketing exposures. Aim 1 will determine how ECs and
ONPs are perceived over time and across nicotine dimensions in terms of liking, risk perceptions, and social
acceptability. Aim 2 will identify patters of escalation in use of ECs and ONPs across the nicotine dimensions.
Aim 3 will determine which nicotine dimensions are most predictive of nicotine dependence. P4 supports The
Ohio State University's Tobacco Center for Regulatory Science overall integrative theme “Flipping the Script”:
Using the Industry's Nicotine Playbook to Maximize Public Health by examining the impact of ECs and
ONPs, defined by their nicotine characteristics and categorization as starter vs. robust, and perceptions of
marketing in the real world. With strong ecological validity, P4 provides naturalistic observations of youth
behavior to complement the controlled laboratory and experimental assessments that are used in P1-3.
Integration across projects will directly inform premarket tobacco product applications and substantial
equivalence reviews, modified risk tobacco product decisions, and product standards. P4 addresses FDA
scientific domains of Addiction, Behaviors, and Marketing."
10929379,"PROJECT SUMMARY - ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Administrative Core (AC) will provide a structure to facilitate effective and integrative interactions between
the TCORS team. The AC will ensure all programmatic activities focus on achieving the overall goal of the Center
– using our integrative theme, “Flipping the Script”: Using the Industry's Nicotine Playbook to Maximize
Public Health, to understand how industry nicotine manipulations in electronic cigarettes (ECs) and oral nicotine
pouches (ONPs) are impacting product appeal, addictiveness, use patterns, and toxicity. The resulting data will
inform effective product standards and marketing regulations on nicotine manipulations with the intent to
dissuade young people, including non-users, from using ECs and ONPs, but still provide a satisfying and less
harmful alternative for adult tobacco users (smokers and smokeless tobacco users) who completely switch to
these products. The AC will foster and promote the goals of each component (cores and projects) by providing
scientific direction, administrative support, oversight, and integration of Center activities to ensure operational
efficiency. The Specific Aims of the AC are to: 1) Provide overall research direction and center oversight by
setting the research agenda focused on determining how manipulation of nicotine and aspects of product
packaging, impact product appeal, addictiveness, and toxicity; 2) Promote communication and integration within
the Center as well as promote interaction between other funded TCORS, the Center for Coordination of Analysis,
Science, Enhancement, and Logistics (CASEL), the Center for Rapid Surveillance of Tobacco (CRST), and the
FDA and NIH staff; 3) Coordinate and organize committee structure and communications, and ensure operational
efficiency for all projects, pilot studies and cores of the center; and 4) Foster dissemination of tobacco regulatory
research findings, including data sharing. For this last aim, the Translational Tobacco Policy Team (TPT) will
have oversight and provide critical input ensuring research data has translational impact to inform effective
tobacco policy. The AC will ensure that all components of the Center work seamlessly together to accomplish
the overall and component-specific goals of this Center. The resulting data from our center projects will inform
effective product standards and marketing regulations on nicotine dimensions that dissuade young non-users
from using ECs and ONPs but still provide a satisfying and less harmful alternative for adult tobacco users."
10929385,"PROJECT SUMMARY - CAREER ENHANCEMENT CORE
The goal of the Career Enhancement Core (CEC) is to foster the development of researchers planning to
engage in the field of tobacco regulatory science (TRS). The CEC will oversee the career development of 6
current early-career faculty (some of whom are Project co-Leaders), 2 new faculty recruits (funded with
institutional support), and 8-10 postdoctoral fellows, in addition to graduate and undergraduate students. OSU-
TCORS has a strong track record of career enhancement. During TCORS-I, we trained 4 early-career faculty (2
of whom received an NIH career development award) and 7 postdoctoral fellows, 5 of whom are in faculty
positions conducting TRS research or in research/policy positions focused on TRS. Our investigators have
trained numerous other early-career faculty, post-doctoral fellows, graduate, and undergraduate students in TRS
since TCORS-I as well. The OSU-TCORS early-career faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and students will have the
opportunity to work in a rich research environment with experienced mentors and robust mentoring and career
enhancement infrastructure. They will conduct their research within the projects and have opportunities to
propose and conduct pilot projects within our Integrative Theme “Flipping the Script”: Using the Industry's
Nicotine Playbook to Maximize Public Health. Research and training experiences will be anchored in TRS
competencies to provide trainees with opportunities to engage in science on the impact of nicotine dimensions
(source/isomer, form, concentration) on the appeal, addictiveness, and toxicity of nicotine and tobacco products.
The Specific Aims are to: 1) develop a structured, health-equity focused training program on TRS that includes
lectures, readings, journal clubs, and seminars; 2) deliver this structured training program to early career faculty
and postdoctoral fellows engaged in OSU-TCORS projects, with complementary training in grant writing and
exposure to professional development activities; 3) provide opportunities for graduate and undergraduate
students to participate in OSU-TCORS research projects, professional development, and special program

feedback to Principal Investigators, the Executive Committee and the External and Internal Advisory Boards;
and, 5) oversee the OSU-TCORS research pilot studies program, directed to the trainees, which will allow for
the completion of preliminary studies for future grant applications. The CEC will be led by Drs. Amy Ferketich
and Darren Mays, who have experience leading training and educational programs. They will oversee the
development and implementation of the training program, the summer undergraduate research program, the
research pilot studies program, and the evaluation of CEC activities. Training the next generation of researchers
is critical to the success of the TRS and the FDA CTP mission. The OSU-TCORS CEC proposes a highly
integrated and diverse sef of research activities, with a health-equity emphasis, and has a strong track record of
mentorship in TRS."
10885948,"The long-term goal of this research is to examine the link between DNA methylation patterns and presence
and progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) among Mexican Americans (MA) and non-Hispanic whites
(NHW). Here we will address the aims of PAR-19-070 (Research on Current Topics in Alzheimer's Disease
and Its Related Dementias) – NOT-AG-18-047 – by leveraging the ongoing HABLE cohort (R01AG054073) to
identify the epigenetic factors associated with presence and progression of AD among MAs and NHWs.
In our prior work and recent HABLE data, we examined DNA methylation patterns among n= 90 age, gender
and diagnosis-matched participants leveraging the HABLE Biorepository (MCI n=45, controls n=45). We
identified 10 CpG sites and four regions to be differentially methylated in normally aging controls relative to
individuals diagnosed with MCI. Functional gene-set analysis identified four gene sets as significant. Gene
ontology and pathway analysis highlighted neuronal cell death, metabolic dysfunction and inflammatory
processes. Using Bayes gene set enrichment, we found MCI diagnosis was associated with processes
converging on hypertension, diabetes, loss of hearing and olfaction, synaptic transporter activity and
inflammation. These results link peripheral metabolic dysregulation and inflammation with cognitive decline and
suggest that cognitive decline in MAs is a manifestation of factors related to metabolic stress.
By leveraging the HABLE Biorepository, we will conduct a longitudinal Epigenome-Wide Association Study
(EWAS) on biorepository data from n=1800 HABLE (n=900 MA; n=900 NHW) participants to identify
differentially methylated DNA in circulating leukocytes to address two Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Identify DNA methylation patterns in leukocytes that are associated with presence and
progression of Alzheimer’s disease among Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites.
Aim 2. Identify DNA methylation patterns in leukocytes that covary with prevalence and progression of
AT(N) defined biomarkers of AD among Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites.
Aim 1 results will be validated by comparison with data from a funded project (1R01AG061022-01) that is
assessing the role of leukocyte meDNA in AD etiology in the SOL-INCA cohort. Aim 2 results for meDNA
patterns associated with amyloid burden will be compared to data from the New IDEAS study.
The current proposal is highly significant and innovative: 1) The proposed work is the first large-scale
longitudinal examination of meDNA patterns associated with AT(N) Framework-defined pathological markers of
AD among MAs; 2) this study directly meets NIA-defined milestones for AD/ADRD research among diverse
populations; 3) data from this study will be merged with the HABLE database and made publicly available to
the scientific community and the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing project (ADSP) and ADSP-Functional
Genomics Consortium (ADSP-FGC)."
10901920,"Project Description
The mitis group streptococci are ubiquitous microorganisms that colonize the human oropharynx. In susceptible
hosts, these organisms are important opportunistic pathogens and they have shown to cause a wide range of
infectious complications in humans, which includes bacteremia, orbital cellulitis, septic arthritis, and infective
endocarditis. However, despite the clinical significances of these infections, the mechanisms of pathogenesis
and the pathophysiology are poorly understood. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced by these microorganisms
has been identified as an important virulence factor. Furthermore, H2O2 produced by members of this group such
as Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus mitis induced epithelial cell and macrophage death, while H2O2
produced by Streptococcus pneumoniae had a profound effect on the activation of cellular stress pathways in
lung epithelial cells. The genetically tractable model organism Caenorhabditis elegans provides an opportunity
to characterize the pathophysiology in context of the whole organism and to elucidate how non-immune cells
facilitate innate immune and stress responses. In this study, we propose to elucidate mechanisms of activation
of pathogen-induced immune and stress responses by the mitis group streptococci. Our central hypothesis is
that immune and oxidative stress responses are mediated by the bZIP transcription factors ZIP-2 and ZIP-10 via
pathogen-derived H2O2. To address our hypothesis the following aims will be tested; Specific Aim #1. To
elucidate the mechanism how the bZIP transcription factor, ZIP-2 mediates the effector-triggered immune
response in C. elegans against streptococcal-derived H2O2. Specific Aim #2. We will determine the mechanisms
of activation of an immune and oxidative stress response via the bZIP transcription factor ZIP-10 in response to
the pathogen-derived H2O2 in the worm. Specific Aim #3. To demonstrate the conservation of these
mechanisms identified in aims 1 and 2 in human gingival fibroblasts. The proposed study is significant because
we will identify how H2O2 produced by the mitis group streptococci causes pathogen-associated disruption of
cellular processes and in turn the activation of protective mechanisms. Elucidating the protective mechanisms
will help identify novel therapeutic strategies to combat these pathogens."
10914173,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sexual and gender minority (SGM) adolescents are at increased risk for suicide. Approximately 1 in 3 SGM
adolescents report having attempted suicide compared to 1 in 10 non-SGM adolescents. SGM adolescents are
thought to be vulnerable to suicide because they must negotiate typical stressors of adolescence alongside
coming to terms with an SGM identity, which can involve managing exposure to stigma-related stressors
including external stressors (e.g., bullying) and navigating taxing internal psychological stressors (e.g., identity
concealment). The overarching goal of this proposed K01, entitled Project SPIRiT (Suicide Prediction In Real-
Time), is to examine the influence of stigma-related stressors (e.g., bullying, identity concealment) and
universal suicide precursors (e.g., hopelessness) on suicidal ideation among SGM adolescents recently
hospitalized for acute suicidality. I will utilize state-of-the-art real-time mobile monitoring methods incorporating
both ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and global positioning system (GPS) data to pursue the
project’s three aims: (Aim 1) develop an EMA+GPS assessment approach capable of capturing both self-
reported and place-based exposure to stigma through focus groups with SGM adolescent recent inpatients;
(Aim 2) examine precursors to suicidal ideation among SGM adolescent recent inpatients through a 28-day
EMA+GPS study; and (Aim 3) develop and refine components of a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI)
targeting SGM adolescent suicide risk, informed by qualitative data from focus groups with Aim 2 participants
and in-depth interviews with clinicians and JITAI experts. Evidence from Project SPIRiT will lay the groundwork
for an NIMH R01 to further test an empirically informed suicide prevention JITAI for high-risk SGM
adolescents. To successfully conduct the proposed research project, I will: (1) obtain training in innovative
approaches to micro-longitudinal research methodology, including EMA+GPS technology; (2) develop
expertise in conducting responsible research with clinical populations and addressing safety concerns; and (3)
acquire skills in developing an empirically informed JITAI to reduce suicide risk. By engaging in mentored
research with Dr. John Pachankis (primary mentor) and an expert team of co-mentors and collaborators at
Yale University and beyond, and participating in coursework, seminars, workshops, scientific conferences, and
regular mentorship meetings, I will develop the skills necessary to successfully carry out the proposed
research activities and meet my long-term career goal of becoming an independent scientist. Yale University
offers rich intellectual and practical resources, an interdisciplinary research and training environment, and
professional development and collaborative opportunities to support early-career investigators in launching
their independent research careers. The proposed K01 will provide me with the training, mentorship, and
protected time necessary to establish an independent program of research focused on SGM disparities and
suicide prevention through rigorous scientific inquiry and intervention development."
10907581,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen that infects immunocompromised
individuals, especially in the hospital setting. This bacterium is an important pathogen in people with weakened
immune systems, injuries, and other underlying physiologic dysfunctions. P. aeruginosa is responsible for up to
20% of all hospital-acquired pneumonias. It is one of major causes of nosocomial infections and has been noted
to be one of the most common bacteria co-infecting patients with COVID-19 or causing super-infections following
COVID-19 infections. Despite improvements in antimicrobial therapy and hospital care, P. aeruginosa
bacteremia and pneumonia remains fatal in about 30% of cases. P. aeruginosa is also the leading cause of
chronic life-threatening lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. This bacterium is naturally antibiotic resistant
and infections are notoriously difficult to treat once established, with no vaccine available.
We propose using the abundant and essential protein, elongation factor-Tu (EF-Tu), as an antibody target for P.
aeruginosa. While best known for its role in protein synthesis, work from our group and others indicate that EF-
Tu can be surface-exposed on P. aeruginosa. Our PRELIMINARY RESULTS show that P. aeruginosa EF-Tu is
immunogenic in mice and protective in a murine model of acute P. aeruginosa pneumonia. We have generated
a mouse monoclonal antibody to EF-Tu promotes partial clearance of P. aeruginosa in this model.
This “Partnerships for the Development of Novel Therapeutics to Combat Select Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria
and Fungi” (RFA-AI-22-028) and represents a collaborative effort between Dr. Joanna Goldberg at Emory
University in Atlanta, GA (the PI), Dr. Vu Truong at Aridis Pharmaceuticals in Los Gatos, CA (industrial partner),
Dr. Marion Pepper from the University of Washington, Seattle, WA and Dr. Sebastian Alberti from the University
of Balearic Islands in Palma, Spain. Using spleens from mice we will immunize mice with EF-Tu using protocols
optimized for protection and blood from humans that have high titers of antibodies to EF-Tu, we will obtain B-
cells that will be screened at single cell level using flow cytometry and a nanoculture microfluidic array,
respectively, to identify monoclonal antibodies specific for P. aeruginosa EF-Tu, followed by functional screens
for binding and phagocytic killing of P. aeruginosa. We will also test these monoclonal antibodies for efficacy in
mouse models of infection as an initial step toward future clinical studies. We believe the studies proposed here
represent the appropriate first steps towards developing a new passive reagent that could be given to P.
aeruginosa-infected patients regardless of the nature of the infecting strain and associated antibiotic-resistance
profile, as well as the immune status of the patient. By the completion of this project, we will have generated and
validated 10 murine-derived and 10 human-derived monoclonal antibodies to EF-Tu. Partnering with Aridis
Pharmaceuticals for this project will keep us focused on our goal of developing these reagents for human use."

10876454,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pneumonia is the most common cause of hospitalization due to infection in the US and the most common
cause of infection-related death. Mortality in healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) is 13% overall and 36%
in patients admitted to the ICU. Bacterial lung infections are also a frequent complication of prolonged
mechanical ventilation required in patients after major surgery, traume, and severe lung injury due to viral
pneumonias (e.g. SARS-Cov2); mortality in such ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAP) is even more grave.
Two leading bacterial causes of HAP/VAP are the Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (PA) and Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), both frequently highly multidrug-resistant and can develop
resistance to last line carbapenems. Gram-negative bacterial HAP/VAP is frequently complicated by neutrophil-
and cytokine driven hyperinflammation and associated lung damage—which when severe is designated “acute
respiratory distress syndrome” (ARDS). There are no standard clinically proven therapies to support the host
immune system in clearing severe bacterial pneumonia while simultaneously suppressing the
hyperinflammation that leads to lung tissue destruction. Here we describe a highly innovative drug concept for
critically ill patients with severe PA and AB pneumonia with a unique multifold mechanism of action: biomimetic
human macrophage membrane-coated nanoparticles (MΦ-NP). MΦ-NP are made by wrapping cell
membranes derived from human macrophages around biodegradable polymeric cores, retaining their
membrane lipid bilayer and full repertoire of surface structures and receptors, just on a nano (~1/50,000th)
scale. The natural biomimicry imparts to the MΦ-NP the ability to bind, sequester and neutralize bacterial
toxins, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and host-derived proinflammatory cytokines, a tripartite mechanism of action
to curb harmful inflammation, preserved tissue integrity, and facilitate bacterial clearance. Here we describe our
extensive prior published and preliminary results that strongly support the novel therapeutic concept of MΦ-NP
for the treatment of severe Gram- bacterial pneumonia in ICU patients, and how the proven team at San
Diego-based Cellics Therapeutics will support our Clinical Development Plan at every step of the pathway
toward an investigational new drug (IND) application and entry into Phase 1 clinical trials to meet this critical
unmet medical need. In Aim 1 we will study the capacity of MΦ-NP to preserve lung epithelial and endothelial
barrier integrity and function upon pneumonia challenge, including work in novel 3D human iPSC derived
organoids. In Aim 2, we will examine the ability of MΦ-NP to block excessive alveolar macrophage and
neutrophil-driven inflammation but preserve their antibacterial function against MDR Gram- pathogens. Finally
in Aim 3, we will conduct in vivo analysis of the benefits of intratracheal (IT) and/or intravenous (IV) MΦ-NP
therapy on mortality, bacterial clearance, and lung inflammation/damage in murine models of MDR Gram-
pneumonia and perform key studies to assess PK/PD and toxicity profile of MΦ-NP administration."
10893463,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity-related cancers, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, are characterized by a chronic
breakdown in metabolic functioning that impacts quality of life, physical functioning and longevity. Though
obesity plays a pivotal role in the etiology of at least 13 cancer types, the traditional metric for measuring
obesity, body mass index (BMI), is imperfect and may fail to identify a third of individuals at risk of these
cancers owing to metabolic dysfunction. While accumulated cellular damage and abrogated resilience
mechanisms are part of the natural aging process, damage accumulation and dysregulation of homeostasis
mechanisms, potentially driven by metabolic dysfunction, may lead to accelerated biological aging that has
recently been linked to cancer risk and survival. A better understanding of the relationship between metabolic
health, regardless of BMI, with accelerated aging and cancer is needed to inform who to target for prevention
efforts. The long-term goal of this application is to understand how metabolic dysfunction influences biological
aging and risk of cancer, at all levels of adiposity, to inform interventions that prevent or delay these deadly
diseases. The central hypothesis is that metabolic dysfunction, independent of obesity, is associated with
accelerated biological aging and obesity-related cancers. Aim 1 (F99 phase) will leverage data from the Utah
Obesity Study to measure the association between metabolic dysfunction (metabolic syndrome and diabetes)
across BMI categories (i.e., “metabolic health phenotype”) and risk of developing obesity-related cancer
(esophageal, gastric, colorectal, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, uterus, ovary, thyroid, meningioma, kidney, and
breast cancers, and multiple myeloma). In the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), diabetes status at cancer
diagnosis will be measured in relation to cancer-specific and overall survival. This research will be extended in
Aim 2 (K00 phase) where metabolic health phenotype will be studied in relation to accelerated biological aging
and obesity-related cancer risk. In Aim 2a, data from the prospective WHI, Jackson Heart Study, Health and
Retirement Study, Framingham Heart Study and others will be used to measure the extent to which
accelerated biological age explains the association of metabolic health phenotype with obesity-related cancer
risk. In Aim 2b, using data from The Cancer Genomic Atlas (TCGA) cohort, accelerated biological aging will be
evaluated in relation to survival after obesity-related cancer diagnosis. The pre-doctoral to post-doctoral
candidate will expand upon her didactic and experiential training in biostatistics, epidemiology, aging and
epigenetics research both at the University of Utah, Huntsman Cancer Institute, and Yale School of Medicine.
Practical training will be obtained in human metabolism, biostatistics, epidemiology, aging and epigenetics
research. The proposed project will help to better identify those at risk of obesity-related cancers and support
changes in clinical cancer management to support diabetes and accelerated aging prevention."
10909095,"Project Summary
Non-healing ulcers are a common complication of diabetes, resulting in decreased quality of life, elevated rates
of amputation, increased risk of mortality, and high healthcare costs. Unfortunately, current treatments remain
outdated and inadequate. In diabetes, neuropathy and microvascular changes in dermal tissue lead to
dysregulated molecular cues, resulting in chronic inflammation and reduced angiogenesis that prevent wound
healing. Poor angiogenesis is particularly critical given the importance of vasculature in supplying oxygen,
nutrients, and systemic signaling molecules. Impairment of angiogenesis is in part driven by aberrant expression
of coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) at various time scales. Thus, one
promising approach to alter the course of diabetic ulcers is to directly target the expression of upregulated RNAs
in the non-healing state using nucleic acid RNA-targeting therapies; however, delivery challenges render nucleic
acid therapies clinically unfeasible. To address these delivery challenges, the Hammond Lab has developed and
demonstrated self-assembled electrostatic deposition of nucleic acids through the layer by layer (LbL) technique,
which leverages iterative adsorption of polyelectrolytes of alternating charge, to create conformal coatings on
wound bandages with tunable release kinetics. I propose to develop and investigate temporally controlled
release strategies to locally deliver RNA-targeting therapies that promote angiogenesis and healing of
diabetic ulcers. In Aim 1, I will formulate staged release RNA-targeting bandages to promote wound healing
since staged release of therapy for multiple targets will allow the bandages to address different phases of wound
healing. A proof-of-concept bandage will be developed to elute RNA-targeting therapy to stimulate angiogenesis
in both the inflammatory and proliferative wound healing phases, and it will be tested for efficacy in vitro and in
a murine in vivo diabetic ulcer model. In Aim 2, I will identify potential synergies of pro-angiogenic anti-miRs
(miRNA inhibitors), as inhibition of gene expression with anti-miRs enables regulation of many genes along
defined tissue-specific signaling pathways to enhance angiogenesis. Since it is also unknown how delivery timing
of these anti-miR combinations may impact efficacy, we will leverage controlled-release LbL bandages to
investigate this. Through this research, I will advance the delivery of nucleic acids with biomaterial systems and
the targeting of aberrantly expressed coding and non-coding RNAs to promote healing of diabetic wounds. This
work will lay the groundwork for expansion of this platform approach to other diseases of impaired tissue
regeneration where timing the delivery to the healing process is critical, such as venous ulcers, mesenteric
ischemia, and myocardial infarction."

The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was first formally described in 1967, but it has likely been the
predominant cause of death in pandemic viral infections for centuries. Now, the world is at grips with a new
pandemic from SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19, which has infected over 100 million people worldwide resulting in
>2 million deaths. Central to the immunopathogenesis of ARDS is the role of neutrophils and neutrophil
activation, including the release of neutrophil chromatin into the extracellular space in a process termed
neutrophil extracellular traps, or NETs. Originally described as a form of host defense to inactivate pathogens,
NETs have emerged as a potentially maladaptive response to infections, producing substantial bystander injury
to tissues and serving as a nidus for coagulation. We have shown that NETs are produced in response to both
sterile and pathogen-induced acute lung injury (including Influenza A), and when neutralized, lung injury is
reduced without compromising microbial containment. We have also shown that NETs are increased in the
plasma of patients with ARDS and associate with more severe ARDS and ARDS mortality. Emerging reports
indicate that NETs are also present in the blood and lungs of COVID-19 patients. We are now positioned to
rapidly test the role of NETs in response to SARS-CoV-2 in this application, and to develop novel approaches to
neutralize NETs for therapeutic purposes. In Aim 1, we will challenge neutrophils with SARS-CoV-2 virus or
spike protein to determine the production of NETs and NET-induction molecular pathways. We hypothesize that
secreted neutrophil proteases and NETs themselves will cleave spike protein to prime for enhanced viral
pathogenesis. We will also embark on unbiased studies of neutrophil proteins using mass spectrometry to
determine novel pathways of neutrophil activation resulting from SARS-CoV-2, including from neutrophils
isolated from COVID-19 patients. In Aim 2, we will turn our attention to a mouse model of COVID-19 in which
mouse strains expressing human ACE2 will be challenged with SARS-CoV-2 and lung injury, NETs, and
systemic effects measured. We hypothesize that NETs will be produced and predominantly localize to the
alveolar spaces. We will use mice with gain and loss of function mutations in NET pathways (PAD4-/-, DNase1-
/-, DNase1L3-/-) to test for their pathogenicity in this model. In these studies, we will also test a novel DNase to
neutralize NETs into non-toxic mononucleosomes, which could be rapidly deployed to COVID-19 patients.
Finally, we will test for the role of NET-associated platelet activation, complement activation, and coagulation
responses, and therapeutic strategies to mitigate these systemic effects. In summary, these studies will establish
new knowledge on neutrophil activation and the definitive role of NETs in COVID-19 and identify therapeutic
approaches to target NETs in SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS."

People with schizophrenia have a broad range of cognitive impairments, which are major determinants of the
poor functional outcome observed in people with this disorder. Unfortunately, pharmacological and non-
pharmacological interventions have limited benefits for these impairments. In the absence of effective
treatments, cognitive impairments remain a critical unmet therapeutic need, and the development of novel
approaches for their treatment remains a central therapeutic challenge. Over the past 10 years, considerable
evidence has emerged to suggest that the gut microbiota has significant effects on brain development and
behavior, in part, through the regulation of immune system function. The gut microbiota affects immune system
function through the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other mechanisms. There are three
major SCFAs: butyrate, propionate, and acetate, of which, butyrate appears to have the most pronounced
effects on the immune system. Prebiotics are dietary fibers that promote the growth or activity of gut
microorganisms, which leads to enhanced well-being of the host; they have been shown to increase the activity
of multiple different bacteria species, including butyrate-producing bacteria. In light of the emerging evidence
that suggests schizophrenia is characterized by multiple abnormalities of the immune system, which lead to a
pro-inflammatory state, the proposed R61 and R33 projects are designed to evaluate the hypothesis that
prebiotic administration will lead to increased production of butyrate, through increased activity of butyrate-
producing bacteria in the gut microbiota; the increase in serum butyrate levels will be associated with changes
in cognitive function, symptoms, and metabolic measures. In the R61 project, we will conduct a 10-day,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (RCT) to determine if the prebiotic: Prebiotin
(12g/day), an oligofructose-enriched inulin (FOS), alters the hypothesized biological signature, i.e., increases
serum butyrate levels. We will use an inulin-challenge paradigm to asses the effect of FOS on serum butyrate
levels. In the R33 project, we will conduct a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, RCT, to confirm the
ability of the prebiotic: FOS (12g/day), to alter the hypothesized biological signature: serum butyrate levels. We
will also examine the extent to which changes in serum butyrate levels are associated with changes in
cognitive function, symptoms, and metabolic measures. We will use the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive
Battery to assess change in cognitive function. The study will provide critical preliminary data on the clinical
utility of prebiotic treatment for the improvement of cognitive function in people with schizophrenia."

The mosquito Aedes aegypti spreads diseases such as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and others that afflict >100
million people each year. These mosquitoes rely on multiple keen senses to locate human hosts for blood
meals, and for finding conspecifics for mating. Currently, we have only a rudimentary understanding of the
receptors that control these critical behaviors. The goal of the proposed research is to address this gap. The
unifying theme of this proposal is to test the idea that opsins and TRP channels are two key classes of
signaling proteins that have broad roles in sensation and in controlling behavior in Ae. aegypti. Rhodopsins are
the founding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). We recently discovered that opsins are multi-modal
sensory receptors, challenging 100 years of dogma that they detect only light. To find humans, female Ae.
aegypti integrate information from diverse stimuli, including CO2, visual cues, organic molecules, and
convection heat from skin. We discovered another cue. Aim 1 builds on our preliminary data that Ae. aegypti
use infrared (IR) radiation as an additional host stimulus. We outline experiments to reveal the roles of opsins
and the TRPA1 channel in IR detection. We propose to identify the IR-sensing neurons that express the opsins
and TRPA1, and to test a model to explain the role of opsins in IR sensation. To pursue this aim, we devised a
highly effective assay for monitoring IR attraction and a new molecular genetic approach to bypass difficulties
in combining multiple genetic elements. Aim 2 takes advantage of a mutation that we created in another TRP
(TRPV-A), which renders males and females deaf. We will test the roles of hearing and TRPV-A in swarm
formation, in mating, and in finding humans. Aim 2 will also build on the observations that male mating requires
audition mediated by TRPV-A to devise a strategy to overcome a major impediment limiting the efficacy of the
sterile insect technique (SIT). SIT is a promising strategy to suppress Ae. aegypti. It involves inundating a local
population with sterile males, which then render females sterile upon mating. An obstacle to using SIT is that
wild-type males outcompete sterile males. We propose that manipulation of the activity of the TRPV-A-
expressing auditory neurons elevates sterile male mating success, and will thereby increase the efficacy of SIT
in suppressing Ae. aegypti. Aim 3 concerns identifying the sensory receptors for repellents. We propose to test
the idea that an opsin functions as a highly sensitive receptor for insect repellents. If confirmed by the
proposed experiments, this would demonstrate that opsins comprise a new class of olfactory receptor. To
accomplish our goals, we have developed an extensive repertoire of state-of-the-art approaches. These
include new molecular genetic tools, a suite of behavioral assays, original video tracking software, and in vivo
electrophysiological recordings. In summary, this project will reveal the roles of opsins and TRP channels in
allowing mosquitoes to sense humans and conspecific mates. The insights gleaned from this work have
exciting potential to lead to innovative strategies to control Ae. aegypti and reduce insect-borne disease."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a highly lethal malignancy with a 5-year overall survival of <10%.
Lethality is due to late diagnosis, early metastasis and therapeutic resistance. A hallmark characteristic of PDA
is the robust fibroinflammatory and suppressive tumor microenvironment that compresses blood vessels and
restricts drug access. This tumor microenvironment is also believed to interfere with immunotherapies, which are
transforming the standard of care for many other cancer indications. Tumor-antigen specific T cells are
responsible for mediating the therapeutic effects of immunotherapy. While much has been learned about
suppressive cells within the pancreatic tumor microenvironment, factors that impact the differentiation program
of antigen-specific T cells and their antitumor activity is markedly understudied in this disease. We created a
novel engineered T cell therapy that shows marked anti-tumor and anti-stromal activity in an aggressive and
difficult to treat genetically engineered PDA animal model that recapitulates many aspects of the human disease,
including response to immunotherapy. T cells engineered to express a tumor-reactive T cell receptor specific to
mesothelin, which is highly expressed by tumor cells yet poorly expressed by normal cells, is safe, destroys the
stroma, alters myeloid cell composition, induces objective responses, and significantly prolongs animal survival.
Notably, engineered T cells preferentially accumulate in primary tumors and metastasis, challenging the dogma
that PDA is immune privileged. Based on this efficacy, candidate T cell receptors specific to mesothelin for use
in patients have been identified leading to a Phase 1 clinical trial. However, despite engineered T cell persistence
and significant antitumor activity in vivo, a principle obstacle to cure is the progressive loss of engineered T cell
function within the suppressive pancreatic tumor microenvironment. While T cell functionality and differentiation
are well-studied in other cancer indications, little is understood regarding how the pancreatic tumor
microenvironment impacts tumor antigen-specific T cells. Here, we incorporate innovative tools we have
developed to identify mechanistically how engineered T cells mediate stromal remodeling, how the tumor adapts
and evades anti-tumor T cells, and then use this knowledge to develop a cutting edge engineered T cell therapy
for patient treatment with strategic advancements as compared to most cell engineering approaches. Our
Specific Aims are to: (1) Identify how engineered T cells mediate stromal remodeling, (2) Identify the contribution
of TCR affinity and the tumor microenvironment on T cell differentiation and functionality, and (3) Test the safety
and efficacy of a novel cell engineering approach for targeting solid tumors. Our studies will identify
characteristics of T cells and the tumor microenvironment that produce durable antitumor responses during
immunotherapy to create safe and durable clinical opportunities for pancreatic cancer patient treatment."

The goal of this research proposal is to gain mechanistic insight into how the distinct mitochondrial properties of
hippocampal CA2 neurons contribute to their function in learning and memory. Area CA2 is an understudied
region of the hippocampus that has recently gained attention due to its unique capacity to encode social infor-
mation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the essential processes in CA2 required for its function
in social memory are unknown. This proposal builds upon our recent finding that hippocampal CA2 pyramidal
neurons have molecularly and functionally distinct mitochondria compared with neighboring CA1 neurons. Spe-
cifically, our data point to differences in mitochondrial calcium uptake and bioenergetics, which we propose con-
fer unique synaptic and circuit properties essential to CA2 function.
It remains unclear how mitochondrial diversity influences cell- and circuit-specific functions. Incomplete
knowledge of the impact of mitochondrial heterogeneity is a key obstacle impeding our understanding of mito-
chondrial function in brain health and disease. The specific aims of this grant use innovative tools to visualize
and modify molecularly distinct mitochondria to investigate the role of mitochondrial calcium uptake in driving
bioenergetics, mitochondrial localization, and plasticity in the hippocampal circuit. We propose that mitochon-
drial diversity might be a key node in the regulation of cell specific properties underlying neural function, and
may influence region-specific differences in disease pathology. Completion of this project will advance our un-
derstanding of the basic cell biological mechanisms regulating a cell type important for social memory and will
identify novel therapeutic candidates for disorders with social deficits, such as schizophrenia and autism. The
general principles learned about mitochondrial heterogeneity from this proposal will be broadly applicable to
other brain areas and organ systems."

The goal of this proposal is to investigate the role of a human microphysiologic intestine-on-a-chip platform as a
precision medicine tool to model a devastating disease affecting premature infants known as necrotizing
enterocolitis (NEC). We developed preclinical models of NEC using both organoids and a “NEC-on-a-chip” model
system to recapitulate the intestinal environment of the human disease in vitro, gain new insights into disease
pathogenesis and test the functional and clinical utility of our models to evaluate the efficacy of candidate
therapeutics. Our NEC-on-a-chip model utilizes a combination of premature infant intestinal organoids along with
human endothelial cells and patient-derived microbiota, to recreate critical aspects of premature gut
pathophysiology. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that co-culture of these components on intestine-on-a-
chip microfluidic devices produces clinical features seen in human NEC such as gut barrier failure with the
breakdown of cellular tight junctions, decreased epithelial cell proliferation, a dramatic increase in the pro-
inflammatory cytokine response, as well as a significant amount of cell death. In this proposal, we will use several
multi-omic approaches to characterize our NEC-on-a-chip model and compare to the human NEC phenotype.
To achieve this, we developed a multi-center NEC Biorepository, which consists of detailed clinical metadata
corresponding to a plethora of human specimens, including intestinal organoids cultured from the biopsies of
premature infants with or without NEC. Furthermore, we have created a high-throughput and high-content drug
screening platform using premature intestinal organoids to identify drugs or compounds that inhibit the
pathogenic inflammatory responses seen in vitro. Moreover, we will demonstrate the functional and clinical utility
of our patient-derived NEC-on-a-chip model as a precision medicine platform to test the dosing, efficacy, and
toxicity of candidate therapeutics. To successfully complete these studies, we established a multi-disciplinary
team with the expertise of a Neonatologist, Cell Biologist, Pediatric Surgeon, Genome Scientist and
Bioinformatician. Taken together, these studies will make a significant conceptual advance in our understanding
of the multicellular interactions with the microbiome of the developing premature intestine and provide new model
systems and preclinical platforms by which the identification and testing of therapeutics for NEC and other
intestinal diseases can be performed in this vulnerable patient population."

Community health centers (CHCs) are important safety-net providers that provide comprehensive preventive
and primary care to vulnerable populations in the United States, including Medicaid beneficiaries and the
uninsured. CHCs are also notable for providing the spectrum of primary care services, i.e., medical, mental,
and basic dental care within a single medical home. Our overall objective is to explore the impact of changes in
Medicaid reimbursement rate structures on utilization and costs of providing these co-located services in
CHCs, and on their financial position in general. To achieve this goal, we will first estimate regressions on
pooled all-state data for 2011, 2014, and 2018, the years for all states reported rate setting information to the
National Association of Community Health Centers (NAHCH), combined with the federal Uniform Data System
(UDS), which encompasses all individual CHCs. Similarly, we will analyze a balanced panel for the subset of
21 states reporting rate-setting in the full longitudinal sample, years 2011-2019, yielding 3,868 center-year
observations. In particular, we will evaluate effects of opting for the federal based PPS rates versus state
variations known as APMs, and the effects of imposing a single bundled payment rate per visit, i.e., the “all-
inclusive” rate, versus the bundled rates by services category (primary, mental, and dental care), known as the
service-specific rates. Given that in both the PPS or APM regimes, states may opt for either the inclusive rate
or service-specific methodologies, we will explore the interactions of these pairings of payment policies. We will
then examine the policy effects in a pooling of all years, and test for validity of a balanced or unbalanced
longitudinal design. In the panel data analysis, we will employ a fixed effect model, with CHC and year fixed
effects that leverages variations of state policies between states and over time within states. Corresponding to
Aim 1, for visits, we will explore volume in each service category separately, as well as the distribution (share)
of services. Corresponding to Aims 2-3, we will explore unit-costs and financial margins respectively. We note
that while the effects of Medicaid ACA expansions in the overlapping period are well documented in the earlier
literature (generally increasing both volume and costs), remarkably little is known about the effects of variations
in actual Medicaid payment methodologies for CHCs for these outcomes. Our study aims to fill this gap in both
the health services research literature and policy literature. With that, we will use a novel study design to
control the effects of the ACA Medicaid expansions to capture the separate effects of Medicaid payment
approaches."

Reproductive aging occurs earlier than systemic aging as a person with ovaries’ ovarian reserve is depleted as
they approaches menopause. There is considerable variability around when a person with ovaries reaches
menopause, yet few contributing factors have been identified. Assessment of reproductive age involves
measuring ovarian reserve and oocyte function, which has clearly-defined parameters in in vitro fertilization.
As ovarian reserve declines, Anti-Mullerian hormone levels fall and women produce fewer oocytes after
ovarian stimulation. Oocyte function also declines, as fewer mature oocytes are produced and have the
capacity to be fertilized. The mechanisms of these age-related declines are unclear, but may involve changes
in DNA methylation, which are known to occur with age and may reflect the biological processes underlying
reproductive aging. We hypothesize that DNA methylation patterns will be associated with ovarian reserve and
oocyte function, and that people with ovaries with poor ovarian reserve and oocyte function will experience
epigenetic age acceleration and will accumulate more stochastic epigenetic mutations. To test this hypothesis,
we will first perform an epigenome-wide association to examine DNA methylation patterns associated with
each measure of ovarian reserve and oocyte function. Then, we will calculate epigenetic age and age
acceleration, which are indicators of biological aging, and stochastic epigenetic mutations, which increase with
age and may disrupt key biological pathways in an individual. If successful, this proposal will provide a better
understanding of the genes and processes associated with reproductive aging, would allow for future
development of targeted treatments to slow or reverse aging, and would help identify women at increased risk
of chronic disease later in life. This proposal will provide focused training opportunities that will be crucial for
my success as an independent, NIH-funded researcher. I will work with experts in the fields of aging biology
and reproductive aging, epigenetic aging, and clinical and translational research. Finally, I will seek additional
training in grant and manuscript writing. This training will position me to apply for future R01 funding and
become an independent investigator."

Variants in the transcription factor SIX1 or its co-factor EYA1 are known underlying genetic causes of
Branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR), an autosomal dominant disease that results in hearing loss and kidney
defects. Recently, a clinical study reported craniosynostosis (CS) in individuals carrying SIX1 BOR variants,
including 5’ variants (p.Q11X and p.Q22X) that are predicted to lead to haploinsufficiency; these data suggest
that CS may be an undiagnosed defect in BOR. If left untreated, CS can be associated with distortion of skull
shape, increased intracranial pressure, and/or brain damage. As defects in the calvarial bone osteoprogenitor
cells (OPC) before and/or after birth may lead to CS via increased bone deposition in the cranial sutures, in
this application, I plan to address a major knowledge gap regarding Six1 function: What is its role in the
development of the calvarial bones? To detect changes in bone development caused by Six1 loss and
haploinsufficiency, I will quantitatively analyze head morphology using µCT images and tissue formation using
histological analyses (Aim 1). To verify if Six1 and its co-factors have a role the specification and differentiation
of OPCs, I will assess gene expression in vivo using RNAscope and qPCR (Aim 1) and in vitro using neural
crest-derived mesenchymal precursors and OPCs (Aim 2). Lastly, I will perform single cell RNA-seq and
RNAscope to identify cell populations in the supraorbital arch mesenchyme (that gives rise to the rudiments for
parietal and frontal bones) that are affected by Six1 loss and haploinsufficiency (Aim 3). Results from this
application will shift the paradigm of Six1 function as a cranial placode, neural and muscle transcriptional factor
by providing the first direct evidence linking it to normal calvarial development and the pathogenesis of CS.
This application will establish Six1-het mice as a new model for craniofacial disease, and will help elucidate the
mechanisms by which Six1 variants lead to CS. It will also provide training in soft skills, funding and
collaborations required for my next career step. Finally, this training will allow me to bring my extensive
knowledge of Six1 transcriptional function in mandible and otic development to a new area of clinically relevant
research. Consequently, my research may ultimately prove crucial for CS patient diagnosis and care."

People with serious mental illness (SMI; psychotic and major affective disorders) experience significantly
higher rates of morbidity compared with individuals of similar ages without these conditions. Among this broad
population, the most vulnerable are Latinxs living with SMI who are not engaged in treatment. Further, trauma
among people with SMI, in general, is four to five times higher than for the general public, with highest rates
among Latinxs in comparison to other racial and ethnic groups. Despite the availability of effective mental
health treatment interventions, approximately 47% of Latinx adults with SMI are not engaged in treatment.
Those who are engaged have significantly lower rates of treatment adherence, retention, and satisfaction than
White people. Barriers to treatment engagement for Latinxs include lack of bilingual and bicultural clinical
providers, the absence of culturally responsive interventions, lack of access to specialty services in Latinx
neighborhood, self-reliant attitudes, and cultural differences that impact the recognition of mental health
concerns. Some evidence suggests that culturally tailoring interventions to Latinxs may improve treatment
engagement. The proficient use of Motivational Interviewing (MI), an evidence-based and person-centered
treatment approach, has been shown to predict behavior change, such as treatment engagement, greater
medication adherence and reductions in alcohol consumption, and additional outcomes among Latinxs.
However, no research to date has examined the cultural adaptation of the MI spirit or the full approach. To fully
integrate Latinx cultural values and MI, we need to pay attention not just to the intervention, but also to the
method of service delivery. Latinx peers may be in the best position to deliver MI to Latinxs with SMI, given
their lived experience with both the culture and the illness. Of the available research on Latinx peers in
recovery from SMI, evidence suggests that Latinx peer navigators appear to enhance service engagement,
recovery, and quality of life for Latinxs in recovery from a SMI. Therefore, the overall objective of this career
development proposal is to culturally adapt MI to integrate Latinx cultural relational values and trauma informed
care for delivery by peers in recovery from SMI to engage Latinxs with SMI in mental health treatment.
Specifically, the proposed research will 1) identify social and cultural factors that contribute to mental health
treatment hesitancy and engagement among Latinxs with SMI; 2) culturally adapt an MI treatment
engagement intervention that is trauma informed and peer delivered for Latinxs with SMI; and 3) provide
evidence of the feasibility, acceptability, and engagement of target mechanisms associated with the
intervention. My mentors, in combination with a world-class training environment at Yale University, will guide
me towards my goal of becoming an independent bicultural and bilingual investigator of multi-level influences
on mental health inequities, with expertise in designing and conducting rigorous, pragmatic research aimed at
improving engagement, care, and clinical outcomes for Latinxs and other racial and ethnic communities."

Each day, respiratory surfaces are exposed to billions of particles whose accumulation could be harmful if not
rapidly eliminated by mucociliary clearance. In health, mucus is thin and easily transported. In muco-
obstructive diseases such as asthma, mucus is abundant, thick, and poorly transported. Mucus dysfunction is
not adequately treated with existing therapies. To develop more effective therapies, it is essential to improve
our mechanistic understanding of mucin biology. Two polymeric mucins MUC5AC/Muc5ac and MUC5B/Muc5b
are the major macromolecules in airway mucus. They are very large glycoproteins that form even larger multi-
unit polymers. During synthesis, polymeric mucins assemble via conserved carboxy and amino terminal
domains also found in von Willebrand factor (VWF). Published reports on VWF have identified three C-terminal
cysteines required for inter-chain dimerization in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then transit into the Golgi.
These cysteines are also present in MUC5AC/Muc5ac and MUC5B/Muc5b. After assembly in the ER, most
proteins traffic in 90 nm diameter COPII coated vesicles that bud from the ER and get transported to the Golgi.
However, individual mucin monomers are >500 nm long, so packaging assembled mucin dimers into vesicles
for transport requires alternatives mechanisms. The objective of this proposal is to understand the
polymerization and trafficking mechanisms of mucin from the ER to the Golgi. Aim 1 of this proposal (K99) will
employ mice with point mutations in hypothesized cysteines to test their requirements in mucin assembly, ER
to Golgi transport and secretion. In Aim 2 (K99/R00), the role of a non-conventional ER to Golgi trafficking
component, MIA3, in trafficking mucin dimers will be determined using knock down approaches in human cell
lines and primary cultures in health and disease. Aim 3 (R00) will determine the functions of MIA3 required for
mucin ER to Golgi transport by interrogating its isoforms, specific domains, and binding partners, in human cell
lines and primary cultures.. Overall, this work has the potential to identify novel mechanisms of mucin
polymerization and mucin trafficking pathways in health and disease. This proposal takes advantage of the
applicant’s expertise in mucin biology and vesicle trafficking. The additional training will help lead the
candidate’s goal of establishing an independent lab studying mucin biology in health and disease."

The Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI), in collaboration with partners at Oregon MESA (MESA),
Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) and the World Forestry Center (WFC), proposes Wildfires and
Human Health in a Changing Climate, a project to promote public understanding of environmental health
research and its relevance to the health impacts of large and severe wildfires. This project is made possible by
a five-year Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Project deliverables include:
 Bilingual (Spanish/English) 1,400 ft.2 traveling exhibition
 Project website
 Educators’ guide for museum staff and classroom teachers
The exhibition and programs will focus on current research on the health impacts of large and severe wildfires,
and will reach a national audience of family visitors, with a special emphasis on youth underrepresented in
STEM ages 11–17. The project will be developed biculturally and bilingually (Spanish/English) to provide
accessibility to Latine and Spanish-preferring audiences. The visitor experiences will be co-developed with
youth using a human centered design process and tested with youth and family audiences.
The project has four specific aims that primarily target youth (ages 11–17) and their families:
 Foster public understanding of the health impact of wildfire and smoke exposure, especially on
 vulnerable and sensitive populations.
 Promote health strategies to assess risks and minimize harms of wildfire and smoke exposure.
 Foster public understanding of how land use practices and climate change contribute to more
 catastrophic wildfires.
 Promote and explore strategies to mitigate and adapt to wildfire and climate change, especially in fire
 management and forest restoration.
A collaborative, multidisciplinary team from MESA, OHSU, and WFC, with OMSI personnel with expertise in
informal science education and bilingual exhibit development, will work together to ensure that current science
is accurately interpreted and effectively presented to reach intended audiences. The project will foster better
public understanding of the health impacts of large and severe wildfires, and awareness of its causes and
strategies for mitigation and adaptation. Visitors will explore wildfire and human health through a variety of
forms—multisensory hands-on interactive exhibits, graphic panels, real objects, personal stories from frontline
communities, and an accompanying website. Following the project’s five-year development, the exhibition will
begin an eight-year national tour, reaching more than one million people."

Project Title: CONVOY: A Cultural approach of Navajo Youth to Bio- medical Sciences.
Need Assessment: STEM Learning Ecosystems are localized multi-stakeholder collaborative networks
(MSCNs) that are “dynamic collaborations among schools, out-of-school time programs, STEM expert
institutions (eg., museums, science centers, and institutions of higher education), the private sector,
community-based organizations, youth and families”, and has been identified as one of the key sources to
harvest human capital and contribute to novel interventions through the development of advanced
knowledge. We will create a bridge between traditional indigenous knowledge and modern biomedical
science via “CONVOY”. Peer Groups: Numerous peer groups focus on the development of K-12 and
undergraduate research and education programs for underserved minority communities, but there are very
few who are focusing on healthcare and biomedical sciences. This proposed activity will provide the
students with health disparity-related research experiences, hands-on laboratory training, and other
educational and communication opportunities via Science Café and Health Fairs to prepare them for future
leadership and careers in healthcare, biopharma, and other associated professions. Proposal: “CONVOY”
project will bring together students from Junior high schools, high schools (mentees) and Diné College
(mentor avatars) in order to spawn their enduring curiosity in biomedical and health sciences — especially
among Navajo (Diné) youth and students from other underserved communities— while adapting the
concept of “near-peer” network to bring forward the local health issues to the open forums. Specific Aims:
CONVOY, identifies causal links between Indigenous traditional knowledge and modern science to achieve
four specific aims i.e., 1) Motivate Navajo high school and junior high school students to study and pursue
careers in Biomedical Sciences and related fields; 2) Nurture holistic practices that bridge the gap between
Navajo traditional practices and western medicine to develop a marketable land based solution, while
focusing on problems faced by local communities; 3) Prepare students to enroll in institutions of higher
learning and provide opportunities to earn college credit in high school through Dine College’s Dual
Enrollment Program for biomedical sciences, and 4) Develop curriculum for a 10-week summer program
to support activities by “CONVOY”. Expected Outcome: the benefits of the “Convoy” will include but
are not limited to: i) Development of a need appropriate support system (near-peer-mentorship) that will
serve as a main technical support for training and innovative research to help provide better healthcare
services, ii) Greater understanding of the local epidemiology of infections, diseases and health disparities,
iii) Increase local workforce development in several critical areas that have implications broader than
current COVID-19 pandemic or other infections and diseases."

Spatial RNA-sequencing has emerged as a revolutionary tool that allows us to address scientific questions
that were elusive just a few years ago. Specifically, the spatial RNA-sequencing technology has the potential
to revolutionize studies of tissue structure and function in health and disease. However, much of the potential
has yet to be realized as statistical methods to analyze spatial RNA-seq data are lacking. For many types of
analyses, the methods currently in use obscure and, in some cases, distort biological signals. A number of
statistical and computational challenges must be addressed to prevent inaccurate conclusions, and to
optimize novel discovery. This proposal addresses those challenges. In particular, while the technology is
powerful, it is not without error; and considerable contamination exists in spatial RNA-seq data. We propose
methods to remove this contamination and thereby ensure robust and accurate downstream inference. We
also propose statistical methods to adjust for technical variability induced by differences in sequencing depth.
By reducing technical variability, these methods will improve the power with which signals of interest can be
studied. Finally, we propose methods for characterizing changes in the dependence structure of sets of genes.
These types of methods are required to improve our understanding of how coordinated changes in genes
affect tissue structure and function in health and disease. Taken together, successful completion of this project
will help to ensure that maximal information is obtained from powerful spatial RNA-seq experiments."
10918134,"Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by genetic mutations in the
NPC1 (95%) and NPC2 (5%) genes. Neurological features of NPC bear striking resemblances with Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), leading to some experts considering NPC as “Childhood Alzheimer’s”. No FDA-approved therapy
is available. Lipids and cholesterol defects associated with the NPC disease are well understood. However,
immune pathways underlying neuroinflammation and Purkinje cell death in the NPC disease remain unknown.
We recently found that the innate immune STING pathway is activated by NPC-deficiency, and genetic deletions
of STING pathway components in mice are able to remarkably rescue NPC neuropathology. The overall goal of
this project is to understand how STING drives neuropathology associated with the NPC disease. Aim 1 will
focus on intracellular mechanisms, where we will dissect how STING signaling is activated by NPC-deficiency.
Aim 2 will focus on brain tissue pathology, where we will comprehensively determine STING expression cell
types, activities and their functional contribution to the NPC disease. Aim 3 will focus on therapeutic assessment,
where we will treat Npc1-/- mice and NPC1 patient iPSC-derived cells with existing and new STING pathway
inhibitors. STING has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson’s disease,
ALS/FTD and now NPC1. Studies proposed here will provide a much-needed comprehensive understanding of
STING pathway function in the brain as well as a step-by-step mechanism from STING activation to
neuropathology."
10885976,"Stefano Tarantini, PhD, is a junior aging researcher whose overarching goal is to develop an independent
research program to understand and apply nutritional lifestyle interventions to the field of cerebrovascular aging
to ameliorate age-related vascular cognitive impairment and dementias (VCID). To achieve this, the following
K01 proposal aims to further Dr. Tarantini's training to enable him to explore the role of midlife obesity on
neurovascular senescence as it relates to the development of vascular cognitive impairment and related
dementias. Candidate: Dr. Tarantini is an Assistant Professor in the Dept. of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
at the University of Oklahoma HSC. This K01 proposal perfectly builds on his previous training and extends his
research in a logical direction that is becoming growingly relevant in the field of cognitive aging. This proposal
identifies 5 training goals: 1) Acquire novel training in the field of nutrition; 2) Receive training in data integration,
biostatistics, single-cell transcriptomics, and analysis; 3) training in advanced intra-vital imaging techniques; 4)
Improve skills in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); 5) Establish and lead an independent research laboratory.
Mentors/Environment: The mentoring team will assist the candidate to ensure his success through the K01
training and research activity. The proposed plan will leverage resources of the newly established Center for
Geroscience and Healthy Brain Aging, the NIH supported Nathan Shock Center, and the NIGMS-funded CoBRE
training grant. The department is fully committed to support Dr. Tarantini independently of the outcome of this
K01 application. Research: Mid-life obesity promotes cellular senescence. Aging-induced senescence among
cells of neurovascular unit (NVU) associates with neurovascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Yet, the
impact of obesity-induced senescence on the cellular components of the NVU and its function is not understood.
We hypothesize that obesity accelerates NVU senescence, impairing structural and functional qualities of the
cerebral vasculature. The resulting decline in cerebral blood flow and increased neuroinflammation contribute to
cognitive impairment. We predict that elimination of senescent cells rejuvenates the NVU, restoring its youthful
functional and structural integrity, which confers cognitive benefits. This project aims to characterize mid-life
obesity-induced senescence in the neurovascular unit (Aim 1), the effects of senescence on NVC responses,
cerebral blood flow and cognition (Aim 2), and how senescence alters microvascular density and BBB integrity
in mouse models of mid-life obesity (Aim 3). Summary: This K01 proposal utilizes advanced imaging and
sophisticated sequencing and data integration techniques in a relevant model of mid-life obesity to detect
senescence in the NVU of the brain. Understanding the relationship between brain cellular senescence and
impaired BBB function and diminished cerebrovascular hemodynamic responses (which are responsible to
maintain intact cognitive function) will be critical to address potential nutritional interventional therapies to avoid
obesity-induced cognitive deficits in aging and develop an independent research direction."
10891610,"Abstract: We are engaged in the systematic efforts to exploit catalytic carbon–carbon (C−C)
bond activation for developing new, general and synthetically useful methods. Our objective, in
the proposed funding period, is to focus on C−C activation and functionalization of ketones and
amides, as they are easily accessible and widely found in feedstock chemicals. Through
harnessing the power of transition-metal catalysts, sometimes assisted by an organic activator, a
suite of new, selective, and efficient methods involving C−C activation of ketones and amides will
be developed. Specifically, we will: (i) explore new C−C activation modes that allow rapid access
to complex sp3-rich ring systems, (ii) enable a novel and broadly applicable cross-coupling
reaction via deacylation of unstrained ketones, and (iii) allow selective activation of α-C−C bonds
of unstrained amides. The research proposed is expected to offer an atom-economical approach
for preparing novel complex sp3-rich molecular scaffolds from readily available substrates, which
should help to access greater chemical space beyond the “flatland”. It is also expected to simplify
synthesis through new strategies for bond disconnections and to enable skeletal editing of
complex molecules under redox-neutral conditions, capitalizing on C−C
activation/functionalization of ketones and amides."
10895410,"Regulation of gene expression along the dorsal-ventral (DV) axis of Drosophila embryos serves as a 
paradigm of developmental patterning. Comparative studies of cis-regulatory elements that 
support expression along the DV axis from many research groups have made it clear that 
combinatorial input into enhancers by multiple transcription factors drives distinct 
spatial-outputs of gene expression. A pivotal regulator of this patterning process is the 
maternally-provided transcription factor Dorsal (Dl), homolog of NFKB. Dl functions as 
 a morphogen to activate target gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner along 
 the DV axis, contributing to the initiation of zygotic gene expression at the 
maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). Using live imaging, we quantified the Dl gradient in embryos 
and found, surprisingly, that levels change not only in space but also build in time. Our 
focus during the previous funding period was to study the impact of these Dl dynamics on target 
gene expression using quantitative approaches involving analysis of live imaging or fixed embryo 
time-series data to provide insight. In the current proposal, we follow three new and exciting 
directions, which relate to the timing of cell actions in early embryos and arose as a result of 
the previous work. Project 1 involves studying how broadly-expressed activators and repressors 
cooperate to control the onset of zygotic gene expression during the MZT. We hypothesize that 
broadly-expressed repressors are equally important to pioneer activators in the control of 
chromatin accessibility and thereby also regulate initiation of zygotic gene expression. Project 2 
focuses on dissecting the function of short-transcripts for long genes that are expressed 
specifically in the early syncytial embryo. We hypothesize that these short transcripts act to 
regulate timing of cell signaling pathway activation by functioning as dominant-negative variants 
of signaling molecules. Project 3 focuses on identifying the mechanism by which FGF signaling 
regulates adherens junctions (AJs) and their interaction with the actin cytoskeleton to contribute 
to the first epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in embryos; in particular, to understand 
how a degron associated with one FGF ligand, Pyramus, limits signaling time. The overarching goal 
of the proposed research program is to understand how the timing of these cell activities - 
patterning, signaling, and movement - are controlled in developing Drosophila embryos 
and to provide general insights applicable to higher animals. While many studies have focused on 
spatial outputs of gene expression, less is known about the temporal dynamics of patterning. 
Drosophila embryos are a tractable system to study MZT as it occurs in 3-4 hours, in 
contrast to taking days in preimplantation mammalian embryos. The Drosophila embryo is 
also amenable to live in vivo imaging and tracking analyses making it well-suited to the study of 
nascent transcription and cell morphology. Lastly, our proposed studies will provide general 
insight into early embryo development of higher animals as many regulatory mechanisms are likely 
conserved."
10932853,"Abstract
Genome-Wide Association Studies, whole-genome sequencing, and high-throughput techniques have
generated vast amounts of diverse omics data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery. Only 5-10% of druggable proteins are targeted by
approved drugs. The undrugged orphan proteins are potential targets of yet-incurable diseases but whose
endogenous and exogeneous ligands are unknown. Furthermore, there is a knowledge gap to link drug-target
binding affinities to clinical outcomes. We know little if the target is activated or inhibited by the binder (i.e.,
function activity: agonist vs. antagonist). To date, few experimental and computational tools can determine
genome-wide protein-ligand interactions (PLIs) for orphan proteins and ligand-induced functional activities
(LIFAs) for both orphan proteins and majority of well-studied proteins. Existing machine learning techniques are
mostly unsuccessful in predicting the ligand of orphan proteins due to an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem, i.e.,
they cannot reliably predict the function of an unseen protein if it is significantly different from the proteins in the
training data in terms of sequence and structure. Commonly used computational tools for structure-based drug
design, such as protein-ligand docking/scoring and Molecular Dynamics simulations, are neither scalable nor
particularly reliable. As a result, we only have a limited capability of compound screening for orphan proteins.
This proposal seeks to develop and experimentally validate innovative methods for predicting genome-wide PLIs
and LIFAs to address aforementioned challenges. Building on our successful proof-of-concept studies and our
close multidisciplinary collaborations between experimental and computational laboratories, we will develop a
novel computational framework to model drug actions on a multi-scale by integrating big data from chemical and
structural genomics and developing innovative deep learning algorithms. Specifically, we will develop a structure-
enhanced deep learning framework to reliably and accurately predict protein-ligand interactions for orphan
proteins on a genome-scale. We will integrate functional genomics with chemical genomics to predict ligand-
induced functional activity. We will apply the methods developed to design and experimentally test inhibitors of
orphan anti-cancer target AVIL and dual antagonists of dopamine receptors for opioid use disorder (OUD). The
proposed research offers an innovative concept, methodology, and translational applications. Completing this
research will fill a critical knowledge gap in understanding drug actions in a biological system and significantly
impact drug discovery for complex diseases, many of which lack effective and safe treatments. The developed
methodology and platform will not only immediately impact the NIH’s “Illuminating the Druggable Genome”
Program but also has potentially broad applications in other areas of biomedical research."
10837099,"Project Summary
Alcohol misuse and addiction is a growing and increasingly destructive socioeconomic national and global crisis.
There is a critical need for novel therapeutic interventions that, rather than managing symptoms, reverse
alcohol-induced neurophysiological changes. One effect that alcohol, and myriad other addicitive drugs, produce
in the brain, is the disruption of long-term synaptic depression (LTD), particularly the presynaptic form of LTD
that occurs at corticostriatal synapses. The striatum is associated with compulsive and habitual behaviors,
including drug addiction. Drug-induced disruption of LTD in dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is associated with
increased habitual behavior whereas LTD restoration restores drug-disrupted goal-directed behavior. We have
found that alcohol disrupts striatal presynaptic mu opioid receptor (MOR)-mediated LTD that, in the DLS, occurs
exclusively at anterior insular cortex inputs (AIC-DLS synapses). MOR-short-term depression at thalamic striatal
inputs are unaffected by alcohol exposure. Identifying the molecular changes that occur presynaptically following
alcohol exposure at AIC-DLS synapses, but not at thalamostriatal synapses, may reveal new targets for
pharmacological interventions in alcohol use disorder and addiction. The specific problem though is that
identifying presynaptic-specific changes in protein-protein interactions using pharmacological and genetic tools
is laborious, inefficient, and relies on a priori knowledge of signaling pathways, likely missing key molecular
players that could be affected. Based on our preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that in vivo alcohol
exposure alters PKA-dependent presynaptic protein organization that is required for MOR-mediated LTD
induction. We will capitalize on the combined physiological and proteomic expertise of the investigators to
develop a novel biochemical methodology that is able to selectively determine the precise ex vivo and in vivo
changes that occur in the protein interactome precisely within AIC synaptic terminals (but do not occur within
thalamostriatal terminals) in DLS during the induction of MOR-mediated LTD and following in vivo exposure to
alcohol. The comparison between these alcohol-sensitive AIC-DLS synapses and the alcohol-insensitive
thalamic inputs will allow us to determine what makes some synapses susceptible to alcohol’s deleterious effects
and others resistant. This methodology employs mouse brain slice electrophysiology, in vivo alcohol exposure,
and viral vector-driven expression of proteins that allow for proximity labeling within presynaptic terminals with
subsequent proteomic analyses. Using this new tool we will open the “black box” of presynaptic proteome
changes that we predict will uncover previously unidentified synaptic plasticity protein-protein interactions that
are disrupted by alcohol and other addictive drugs. Furthermore, we aim to identify novel protein interactions
that may prove to be therapeutic targets for treating alcohol use disorder and addiction."
10906066,"ABSTRACT: The incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in people with HIV (PWH) is ~2.5-fold higher
than among HIV-uninfected adults of similar age. HIV-attributable CVD risk is highest in Africa.
Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring with a portable cuff worn for 24 hours provides mean daytime
and nighttime blood pressures and detects abnormalities in the diurnal variation of blood pressure such as
nocturnal non-dipping, which is defined by the absence of the 10% usual fall (dip) in blood pressure at night.
ABP more accurately predicts CVD events than office blood pressure. Elevated nighttime blood pressure and
non-dipping may contribute to the excess CVD risk in PWH. Small, cross-sectional studies suggest that non-
dipping is more common in PWH and may be associated with CVD. The long-term goal is to reduce CVD
morbidity and mortality in PWH. The study objectives are to 1) compare the time course of non-dipping and
resulting preclinical CVD in PWH vs. HIV-uninfected adults and 2) to identify potential pathophysiologic
pathways that could be targets for future intervention. We propose a comparative cohort study of PWH and
HIV-uninfected adults with repeated measures of ABP, sleep, SNS activity and preclinical CVD to be
conducted in an established cohort of 500 PWH and 500 HIV-uninfected adults in Tanzania.
Aim 1: To determine the prevalence of confirmed non-dipping and its association with incident
preclinical CVD after 36 months in a cohort of 500 PWH on stable ART and 500 matched HIV-uninfected
adults (age >30 years) in Tanzania. ABP will be performed at baseline and then repeated at 1 month.
Preclinical CVD will be quantified at baseline and after 18 and 36 months. Incidence of CVD events will also be
monitored. We will also examine other ABP abnormalities in relationship to preclinical CVD.
Aim 2: To determine the temporal relationship between sleep disorders, SNS activity and non-dipping
and whether this differs by HIV status or gender. We will quantify sleep and SNS activity at baseline and
after 18 and 36 months on all participants. We will also investigate the renin-angiotensin system, insulin
resistance and chronic inflammation as potential pathways leading to non-dipping. We will also compare
temporal trends in sleep and SNS activity between PWH and HIV-uninfected adults.
The proposed research will be the first longitudinal study of ABP and sleep disorders in Africa and will directly
inform HIV-specific and general guidelines. We will also lay groundwork for a mechanistic clinical trial to test a
novel, low-cost strategy targeting ABP abnormalities to prevent CVD in PWH."
10906759,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Tuberculosis (TB) kills 1.5 million people per year. Efforts to reduce this number have been hindered by the lack
effective diagnostics and a protective vaccine underpinned by gaps in the understanding of the immune response
in TB disease. While cellular immunity is important, the humoral immune response to infection by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) is poorly understood. Antibodies, specifically IgG, are critical components of the adaptive
immune response which have been indispensable in our understanding of infectious diseases and vaccine
development. Antibodies function through the combination of recognizing antigens by the Fab domain and the
recruitment of immune effector responses via the Fc domain. Variability in the Fc domain by isotype, subclass,
and post translational glycosylation impact engagement with Fc receptors on immune cells that alter function in
clinically significant manners. We have published that the antibody Fc domain diverges between individuals with
latent infection who appear healthy and able to restrict bacteria compared to active TB disease which is
permissive to Mtb replication. These distinctions are linked to differential Mtb burden in an in vitro primary human
monocyte derived macrophage model of infection. How exactly antibodies might function in this context and its
physiological relevance are questions that this proposal begins to address. The specific aims are 1: Determine
how the Mtb antigenic repertoire impacts polyclonal IgG functions, 2: Identify the macrophage pathways by which
the IgG Fc modulates Mtb survival, 3: Examine the in vivo effect of polyclonal IgG on chronic Mtb infection. The
scientific objective of this proposal is to determine how polyclonal IgG contributes to restrictive and permissive
host states for Mtb. The central hypothesis is that polyclonal IgG from individuals with active TB disease induces
a host state permissive to bacterial growth. The overall goal is to understand fundamental mechanisms of
humoral immunity in TB through antibodies to inform diagnostic, therapeutic and vaccine design."
10889044,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One of the most pressing public health priorities for the COVID-19 pandemic is the development of an effective
and inexpensive therapeutic. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop such COVID-19 treatments, as
well as the methods needed to rapidly create such molecules as soon as any new pathogen is identified. The
central hypothesis is that computational design can be used to quickly create proteins with potent antiviral activity
and others that suppress “cytokine storms” associated with advanced infection. Such countermeasures, if rapidly
developed and deployed, could save millions of lives during an outbreak until vaccines are developed. The
specific aims are to: 1) overcome current limitations in the discovery and development of protein therapeutics by
creating methods for the de novo design of hyper-stable miniproteins that bind tightly to vulnerable binding sites
on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein, including the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the ACE-2 cellular
receptor and the fusion peptide region; 2) Enhance the avidity of such anti-Spike minibinders through genetic
fusion of multiple copies, or through rational design of higher-order oligomers to create drug compounds that are
less prone to viral mutagenic escape; 3) Apply the same minibinder design pipeline to create cytokine receptor
antagonists of key cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β likely involved in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS)
associated with COVID-19 mortality; 4) Assess the efficacy of antiviral and anti-interleukin minibinders by several
routes of delivery (intravenous, intranasal and subcutaneous) in rodent models of COVID-19 and assess
immunogenicity in order to identify those designs best suited for further preclinical development. As proof of
principle, the first anti-Spike minibinders have already been designed, were found to bind to SARS-CoV-2 Spike
RBD, and were found to neutralize live virus with activities rivaling the most potent known antibodies. This
proposal is innovative because it seeks to apply powerful emerging methods in the computational design of new
protein therapeutics to the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposal is significant because it would be the first example
of computational protein design yielding potent and entirely de novo antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapeutics
for an active pandemic. Ultimately, rapid minibinder design methods have the potential to generate treatments
for future pandemics, as well as for many other common and neglected diseases and conditions."
10840356,"Abstract. Oral health problems and unmet dental needs are prevalent in women living with HIV (WWH). For
WWH across the lifespan, physiological changes that induce fluctuating hormone levels (e.g., puberty,
pregnancy, aging) can also significantly impact oral health, most commonly through exaggerated periodontal
inflammation. Neglected dental care and negative oral symptomatology can play a significant role in overall
health by impacting everyday function, e.g., eating and engaging in social interactions. Oral health related
quality of life (OHRQOL) is an important multidimensional construct used to evaluate the impact of untreated
dental disease on quality of life and well-being. OHRQOL in WWH is impacted not only by oral health
conditions, but also by the social determinants of health, age, and mental health symptomatology. Mental
health challenges, i.e., depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are prevalent in WWH and
are associated with poor health outcomes, including oral health conditions. The co-occurrence of depression
and HIV infection has been associated with impaired self-care (e.g., reduced oral hygiene, neglected
preventive dental treatment), as well as dental side effects from psychotropic medication. Despite the high
prevalence of oral and mental health conditions among WWH, there have been no studies addressing the
relationship between HIV, oral health, and mental health over the lifespan.
 Oral health studies of WWH have primarily been conducted among older women in the Women’s
Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), a national prospective cohort study of WWH and women at risk for HIV, now
named the MACS WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS). STAR is a prospective national cohort study of
women of reproductive age living with or at risk for HIV, collecting data harmonized with the MWCCS. The
proposed Comprehensive Research on Oral and mental health among WomeN (CROWN) study will leverage
dental and mental health data from these two cohorts utilizing their shared research infrastructure and data
center. CROWN will enroll a smaller cohort of STAR/MWCCS women (N=400) matched on age, HIV status,
and mental health symptomatology. Participants will attend two CROWN study visits consisting of an adapted
dental survey and periodontal examination. Data collected from ongoing STAR/MWCCS study visits and the
CROWN study visits will be analyzed to: 1) evaluate the independent effects of mental health symptomatology
(e.g., depression, anxiety, PTSD) on OHRQOL and the interactive effects of HIV and age on this relationship;
2) to evaluate the independent effects of mental health symptomatology (e.g., depression, anxiety, PTSD) on
oral health clinical outcomes and the interactive effects of HIV and age on this relationship; and 3) to evaluate
the mediational role of oral health clinical outcomes between mental health symptomatology and OHRQOL and
the potential bidirectional relationships among these variables."
10889279,"PROJECT SUMMARY
With the global scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART), increasing numbers of children with perinatally-acquired
HIV (PHIV) are surviving into adolescence and beyond. Adults living with HIV on ART are at an increased risk
for chronic age-related illnesses, including neurocognitive impairment, as well as oral disease compared to the
general population. Early precursors of these disorders are also highly prevalent in children and adolescents
living with HIV (ALHIV). Given that mental and oral health co-morbidities associated with HIV and lifelong ART
could be driven by overlapping or distinct biological and immunological mechanisms, a better understanding of
these mechanisms is needed to support interventions, particularly among ALHIV. Microbiota- or aging-mediated
processes have been shown to contribute directly to HIV comorbidities. Increased incidence and prevalence of
dental pathologies observed by our group and others among people living with HIV appears predicated by a
differential colonization with pathogenic and commensal microbes. Emerging evidence suggests that controlled
HIV infection alters microbial communities, contributing to a chronic low-grade inflammatory state that underlies
age-associated conditions in children and youth with PHIV. In parallel, epigenetic age acceleration is observed
in adults with HIV on ART when compared to controls and has been linked to neurocognitive deficits. The
objective of this proposal is to identify oral microbial taxonomic and functional features, and aging
markers associated with neurocognition and oral health in ALHIV. Our multidisciplinary research team is
comprised of experts in HIV epidemiology, microbiology, dentistry, medicine, pediatrics, neuropsychology,
bioinformatics and statistical modeling. We will leverage an established NIH-funded cohort of approximately 600
children and adolescents perinatally exposed (+/- PHIV) and unexposed (controls) to HIV living in Nigeria. In 50
ALHIV and 50 sex- and age-matched uninfected adolescents (aged 10-13), we will analyze shotgun
metagenomic sequences of salivary samples to identify salivary taxonomic and functional profiles and will use
the comprehensive Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip array to characterize DNA methylation and measure
markers of epigenetic age acceleration in blood samples. In Aim 1, we will characterize shotgun metabolic
sequences of salivary samples and measures of epigenetic age acceleration in blood samples to examine
associations between (a) oral microbial and functional profiles and (b) epigenetic age acceleration with
neurocognition outcomes in Nigerian adolescents with and without HIV. In Aim 2, we will test whether epigenetic
age acceleration is associated with oral health outcomes in Nigerian adolescents with and without HIV. The
research proposed in this R01 is significant because it will generate new insights into how microbiota- or aging-
mediated mechanisms contribute to neurocognitive impairments and oral conditions in ALHIV."
10837818,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dysphagia frequently develops in persons with AD/ADRD and leads to serious health consequences, including
increased caregiver burden, malnutrition, pneumonia, decreased quality of life, and mortality. Targeted,
efficacious rehabilitative interventions for dysphagia have been developed in other neurodegenerative
populations, but there are currently no effective treatments for dysphagia in AD/ADRD that have lasting effects
on swallowing physiology. Prior to developing interventions to prevent dysphagia-related adverse
sequelae in patients with AD/ADRD, in-depth understanding of factors contributing to dysphagia risk
and trajectories of swallowing change across disease progression is urgently needed, especially in early
stages when interventions can be most effective and impactful. Small, cross-sectional studies in AD/ADRD
have suggested changes in swallowing beginning early in disease progression. However, these prior studies
examining dysphagia in AD/ADRD lack the comprehensive and longitudinal characterization of swallowing
function across the dementia continuum necessary to improve clinical management. Additionally, while novel,
multi-modality swallowing assessments have enabled detection of subclinical swallowing impairments in other
neurogenerative populations, the nature of subclinical changes in AD/ADRD remains unknown. To address these
critical knowledge gaps, we propose a prospective cohort study of persons with AD/ADRD stratified by disease
stage (very mild to moderate) and their care partners. Participants will undergo comprehensive dementia
characterization, including neuropsychological testing and plasma-based biomarkers, as well as multi-modal
swallowing assessments at baseline and every six months. We will also collect a variety of clinical factors (e.g.,
demographics, comorbidities) and measures of oral function (e.g., saliva production, oral health, lingual
pressures), respiratory pressures, sarcopenia, and nutritional status at baseline. The overarching goal of this
research is to inform development of intervention strategies for persons with AD/ADRD through enhanced clinical
and epidemiologic understandings of the onset, nature, and progression of swallowing deficits. Our
multidisciplinary team of experts will achieve this objective via the following specific aims: 1. Define swallowing
changes from very mild to moderate AD/ADRD to: 1a) characterize subclinical dysphagia features; and 1b)
identify clinical factors and swallowing measures that contribute to symptom reporting; 2. Identify risk factors for
swallowing dysfunction from very mild to moderate AD/ADRD; and 3. Determine trajectories of change in
swallowing function in persons with AD/ADRD and association with risk factors. The proposed work represents
the first longitudinal, comprehensive study of swallowing function in a well-characterized cohort of persons with
AD/ADRD. Improved understanding of swallowing function across disease progression will inform development
of targeted interventions to address identification, prevention, and rehabilitation of dysphagia in AD/ADRD."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, New York City (NYC) public transportation has been an essential service to
assure that other essential workers can get to their jobs. Many of the predominantly racial and ethnic minority
transit workers have been exposed to risks at both work and at home, as many workers also reside in high
prevalence communities. The pandemic thrust transit workers into the role of frontline workers, even
though they lacked the training, experience, supplies, equipment, and supervision typically provided for
traditional frontline workers (i.e., health care and first responders). This study, conducted in partnership with
the Transport Workers Union (TWU), Local 100, is designed to: (1) evaluate the cumulative impact of multi-
level interventions to date on current worker health and resilience; (2) develop and assess a worker-driven
model of crisis management to facilitate worker resilience as the pandemic and policy responses evolve (e.g.,
restore lock-down with resurgence; deployment of vaccine); and (3) disseminate findings to provide input into
policy changes and operations to protect non-healthcare essential workers during pandemic events with a
focus to decrease health disparities in high-risk populations.
To achieve these aims, we propose to conduct serial cross-sectional surveys of a systematic sample of the
NYC transit workforce, with the logistical assistance of TWU, representing nearly 40,000 subway and bus
workers. Timing of subsequent surveys will be dynamic to capture real-time shifts in the pandemic and ongoing
changes in policies and practices that impact transit workers. In the first phase, we will first examine the impact
of multilevel interventions already implemented by several entities, including: (a) federal, state, and local
governments and agencies; (b) the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), the public authority in charge of NYC
Transit; and (c) TWU, which provided advocacy, reinforcement of multilevel interventions, referrals, and social
support. Guided by a new Pandemic Preparedness and Resilience model and informed by data from our
recent transit workers pilot study, the existing multilevel interventions will be mapped onto the NIMHD
framework and evaluated to determine their impact on workers’ outcomes (e.g., infection, psychosocial,
behavioral, interpersonal relations, resilience), perceived impact of TWU interventions (e.g., advocacy,
reinforcement with outreach for education and social support), and individual adoption of recommended
practices designed to mitigate community and workplace spread. We will examine potentially moderating
effects of age, sex/gender, race, ethnicity, and occupational characteristics of the workers. Initial and
subsequent survey data will inform ongoing Participatory Action Research (PAR) teams comprised of
academics, workers and other key stakeholders who will formulate data-driven strategies to increase
effectiveness of the multilevel interventions and further support worker resilience in the face of shifting
pandemic events. Results will be widely disseminated to inform policy changes suggested by study findings."

The regeneration of brain tissue has been considered one of the greatest challenges for
regenerative medicine. Implantation of an extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogel can
produce de novo brain tissue by attracting endogenous neural progenitors into a tissue
cavity. These neural progenitors originate in the subventricular zone (SVZ), one of the few
neurogenic sites in the adult brain. Initially, neural progenitors migrate in the peri-infarct-
damaged tissue before invading the bioscaffold. However, little is known about the route
or time-course of migration of these cells. The objective of this application is to develop a
non-invasive MR imaging paradigm that affords the tracking of neural progenitors from the
SVZ to the bioscaffold. Specifically, we here aim to: 1) develop and optimize contrast agent
to label endogenous neural progenitor cells, 2) to non-invasively track the migration of
neural progenitors and 3) to determine the temporal dynamics of neural progenitors
responding to a hydrogel implant. Achieving an in vivo visualization of neural progenitor
migrations will aid us to understand the contribution of neurogenesis to brain tissue
regeneration, but also to devise novel strategies that can manipulate this process."
10804659,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which accounts for more than 90% of the pancreatic
cancer cases, unfortunately has an average 5-year survival rate of less than 10%. To date, both chemotherapy
and immunotherapy, including the checkpoint inhibitors like PD-L1, CTLA-4, has not been effective in treating
PDAC. Although PDAC is infiltrated with leukocytes, they are mostly the suppressive types such as myeloid-
derived suppressor cells, regulatory B cells, T regulatory cells and M2-macrophages, likely due to elevated
levels of molecules such as TGF-β that suppresses T-cell activation.
 We have identified Siglec-15 (S15), which can directly inhibit NFKβ/NFAT signaling resulting in
suppressed T-cell proliferation and cytokine production, as a critical immune suppressor in tumor
microenvironment. Interestingly, S15 is broadly upregulated in various cancers, including triple negative breast
cancers and PDAC, as well as tumor-associated macrophages, with no detectible expression in other healthy
cells besides monocytes. Elevated expression of S15 is correlated with poor survival in PDAC patients.
Importantly, Siglec15 is highly expressed in PDAC cells with low PD-L1, suggesting Siglec15 may be involved
in immune evasion observed in PDL1-negative PDAC.
 Given the overexpression of S15 in PDAC, we hypothesized that a bispecific antibody (bsAb) that
binds both S15 and an immune-suppressive cytokine (TGF-β) could result in greater bsAb accumulation in the
tumor, and thus synergistically enhances T-cell activation for improved tumor suppression. We hypothesize
that bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTE) that bind S15 and CD3 could likewise enhance T-cell immunotherapy
against PDAC, including breaking down the stromal barrier. In pilot studies, our S15/TGF-β bsAb afforded
much more effective tumor suppression than a cocktail of anti-S15 and anti-TGF-β Ab in mouse model of triple
negative breast cancer. Likewise, S15/CD3 BiTE effectively suppressed pancreatic tumor in a xenograft model.
 Building off these promising findings, we seek to explore whether simultaneously modulation of the
tumor immune microenvironment with improved T-cell targeting can lead to more effective therapy against
PDAC. Towards this goal, we will engineer in Aim 1 a panel of bsAb that binds S15 while possessing different
number of binding domains against TGF-β. We will evaluate whether the increased number of TGF-β binding
domains further reduce immune suppression in the tumor leading to more effective therapy in an orthotopic
pancreatic model in mice. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether the most potent S15/TGF-β bsAb from Aim 1
may synergistically enhance S15/CD3 BiTE therapy, both in an orthotopic human pancreatic cancer model in
NSG mice infused with human PBMC and in a syngeneic orthotopic mice pancreatic cancer model. If
successful, our work may lead to improved treatment options for management of PDAC, as well as advance an
overall framework to enhance immunotherapy against different cancers."

Graves’ Ophthalmopathy (GO) is the most serious extra-thyroidal complication that develops in patients with
autoimmune Graves’ hyperthyroidism. It is characterized by increased orbital fat volume and extra-ocular
muscle within the unyielding bony orbit, which can have deleterious consequences on eye function. Orbital
decompression surgery is an effective but invasive treatment used for severe GO. A better understanding of
the pathological mechanisms underlying GO may identify novel targets to inhibit the development and
progression of GO before any clinical manifestation.
 Insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) signaling has been found to be essential in promoting GO
pathogenesis. A monoclonal antibody that binds to and blocks IGF-IR signaling, was recently FDA-approved
for treatment of GO. However, adverse events have been documented, all likely due to the ubiquitous nature of
IGF-IR. A better understanding of IGF signaling and its regulation in orbital tissue is needed to fully understand
mechanism and avoid/reduce off-target consequences. One approach would be to target modifiers of IGF-IR
signaling, instead of the IGF-IR per se. We propose PAPP-A as such a target.
 PAPP-A is a novel zinc metalloprotease that can increase pericellular IGF bioavailability through cleavage of
inhibitory IGF binding proteins, in particular IGFBP-4. Conversely, inhibition of PAPP-A expression or its
proteolytic activity represents an innovative approach to decrease IGF availability with resultant attenuation of
IGF-IR signaling. Interestingly, the most potent stimulators of PAPP-A expression are pro-inflammatory
cytokines, which are increased in orbital tissue from GO patients.
 We hypothesize that PAPP-A is a key modulator of IGF-R signaling in GO. Our Specific Aims are to:
 1) Determine PAPP-A expression (basal and pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced) in orbital
 fibroblasts from GO patients and control subjects.
 2) Determine the effect of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody that specifically inhibits PAPP-A-
 mediated IGFBP-4 proteolysis on IGF-I stimulated proliferation and differentiation in orbital
 fibroblasts from GO patients.
 We have primary fibroblasts from retro-orbital fat of GO patients at early passage in-hand and the experience
with culture and analyses to establish feasibility. Preliminary results support a role for PAPP-A in GO. We
anticipate outcomes from the proposed experiments that could ultimately lead to a novel targeted therapy for
patients with GO."
10865143,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Myonemes are calcium-powered supramolecular protein `springs’ that form the force-generating cytoskeletal
structure in some protozoan ciliates such as Spirostomum ambiguum. In Spirostomum, myonemes
extraordinarily high-power outputs (equivalent to a 2-stroke diesel engine) that enable Spirostomum to contract
to 1/4th of its body length in less than 5 milliseconds (one of the fastest motions at the single cell level). In terms
of power per unit mass, myonemes generate six orders of magnitude more force than conventional ATP-powered
molecular motors such as myosin or kinesin. Myonemes do not contain conventional cytoskeletal elements such
as actin, microtubules or myosin. Rather, myonemes comprise of self-assemblies of two-components: centrin
proteins that are calcium-responsive and Sfi1, an elastic backbone protein. Thus, myonemes offer attractive
features such as non-ATP dependent actuation, ultrafast and high-power delivery and a simple two-component
system, that could enable potentially transformational synthetic biology applications, such as design of artificial
cytoskeletons for synthetic or biohybrid cells to enable them to divide, move or transport cargo similar to their
living counterparts. However, there exists key gaps in our knowledge on the governing biophysical mechanism
of force generation in these springs, how calcium ions act as chemical latches to control and synchronize force
deliver over millimeter length scales, and how these supramolecular assemblies can be synthetically engineered
and self-assembled in-vitro for harnessing them for desired functionalities.
To address these gaps in understanding, the proposed research over the next 5 years will take a two-pronged
approach: i) combine biophysical experiments, live microscopy and soft matter physics-based models to uncover
the biophysical mechanism of force-generation in myonemes in-vivo in living cells, and ii) engineer, self-
assemble and incorporate light-control in synthetic myonemes (synMyo) in-vitro in microfluidic devices and lipid
vesicles. Finally, this work will also utilize mathematical theory and numerical simulations to support our findings.
Long-term, this research will open up a fundamentally new class of nanoscale, Ca2+-based, and light-actuatable
synthetic force generating cytoskeletal assemblies, with applications in intracellular actuation and sensing,
therapeutic drug-delivery devices and artificial cytoskeletons in synthetic cells. For synthetic cells, these
supramolecular springs can enable new mechanical functionalities, such as faster contraction than any
microtubule or actin based system could offer; localized force generation free from polymer tracks; controllability
that is orthogonalized from cell-specific biochemistry; and a novel, non-ATP- or GTP-based energy source to
power movement inside cells."
10904691,"Expanding evidence-based blood pressure/stroke prevention interventions for youth and their older adult
caregivers (parents, grandparents, etc.) is critical to achieving the World Health Organization (WHO) and
Nigerian goals for reducing the hypertension and stroke burden. Innovative strategies that engage local
communities, link younger and older generations, and decrease health disparities are urgently needed. Music
is a positive social determinant of health that is inclusive and can allow people to achieve healthy outcomes. It
is also a non-invasive, safe, inexpensive, evidence-based implementation strategy, that can be used to engage
youth in intervention design and evaluation tailored to their specific needs and those of their older adult
caregivers. The effectiveness of music as an implementation strategy has been documented in various
randomized control trials, including blood pressure and stroke prevention interventions. Nigeria also has a rich
music culture that can be leveraged to increase uptake of evidence-based BP/stroke interventions. We
propose “Innovative Tools to Expand Music-Inspired Strategies for Blood Pressure and Stroke Prevention (I-
TEST BP/Stroke)” to accelerate behavioral BP/stroke campaigns in Nigeria inspired by music. I-TEST-
BP/stroke will use participatory crowdsourcing methods to drive BP/stroke prevention among youth/caregiver
dyads in Nigeria. Crowdsourcing open calls will allow us to identify locally relevant music-inspired campaigns
to increase uptake of BP/stroke prevention. Then, apprenticeships with music and public-health professionals
will build capacity for implementing these campaigns using common music elements (i.e., rhythms, beats,
lyrics) known to impact cardiovascular health. Our preliminary data from Nigeria demonstrate that youth can
develop effective public health interventions using these participatory methods. Our partnership with the
Nigerian Institute of Medical Research provides extensive experience in implementation research, participatory
methods, and pragmatic trials. Building on this strong foundation, our multi-disciplinary research team
proposes a hybrid type II implementation trial with these specific aims: (1) to develop a new, combined, music-
inspired BP/stroke campaigns for youth/caregiver dyads using crowdsourcing open calls and apprenticeships;
(2) to determine whether the final music-inspired campaign increases uptake of BP/stroke prevention
interventions among youth and their caregivers using a stepped-wedge, pragmatic randomized controlled trial
(RCT) in 30 geographic areas; (3) to use mixed-methods approach to explore multi-level factors that influence
the uptake of the music-inspired strategy. Our primary outcomes will be the uptake of strategy and BP/stroke
preventive measures defined here as maintenance of normal BP rates for youth, systolic blood pressure
reduction for caregivers, and increase in stroke preparedness knowledge. Secondary outcomes are reach,
fidelity, acceptability, and sustainment. Our study is responsive to the strategic priorities of the United States
National Institutes of Health, Sound Health, the WHO, the Nigerian Ministry of Health and PAR-22-132."
10895602,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Significance. Globally and in Asia/Pacific, women 15–24 years (y) are at heightened risk of exposure to sexual
violence, including at university. The burden of sexual violence is higher for women than men, and men most
often are the perpetrators. Sexual violence in adolescence is a risk factor for gender-differentiated mental,
physical, and behavioral health conditions in adulthood and is costly for victims and societies. Evidence-based
prevention programs tailored to university men in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are rare. Our team
developed GlobalConsent, a theory-based, six-module educational entertainment program adapted from an
efficacious program tested with university men in the US. In a large attention-controlled trial at two universities
in North Vietnam, GlobalConsent reduced men’s sexually violent behavior (OR=0.71, 95%CI 0.50-1.00) and
increased pro-social bystander behavior (OR=1.51, 1.00-2.28) 9 months post-treatment. Evidence on real-world
implementation is needed. Aims. We will compare the 1) implementation, 2) implementation drivers and
outcomes, 3) implementation effectiveness, and 4) cost-effectiveness of delivering GlobalConsent using one of
two bundled implementation strategies. Approach. We will randomize six medical universities in North, Central,
and South Vietnam to deliver GlobalConsent to eligible first-year male students using lower-intensity (standard)
or higher-intensity implementation strategies salient to university stakeholders in Vietnam. Higher-intensity
strategies will include those in the lower-intensity group plus more 1) implementation and post-implementation
educational outreach with university leaders, 2) pre-implementation leadership training and external
implementation support to university facilitators, and 3) pre-implementation educational outreach, implementa-
tion follow-up, and incentives to foster student adherence and demand to complete GlobalConsent. Our mixed-
methods comparative interrupted time-series design includes 1) qualitative research with university leaders and
implementation teams to compare implementation and implementation settings; 2) repeated surveys with
leaders, implementation teams, faculty, and male students to compare implementation drivers and outcomes, 3)
10 quarterly surveys with male students to compare primary behavioral and secondary knowledge, attitudinal,
and affective outcomes, and 4) cost data to compare the cost effectiveness of the two implementation strategies
bundles on incidents of sexual violence averted. Innovation/Impact. This project is the first to assess two
bundled implementation strategies to deliver an efficacious web-based sexual-violence-prevention program
tailored to university men in Vietnam. Including university partners across Vietnam enables us to test these
strategies in diverse regions and to synergize this effort with in an on-going violence-prevention training initiative
(D43TW012188). Our state-of-the-art approach will produce rigorous evidence that can inform dialogue with
officials about how to deliver GlobalConsent nationally. This project is poised to reduce gender-based health
inequities linked to early sexual violence and to strengthen national capacity to bring GlobalConsent to scale."
10898816,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Eukaryotic cells use diverse mechanisms to regulate translation, many of which depend on
structured RNA elements that interact directly with the protein synthesis machinery. This
ubiquitous and powerful strategy for regulating gene expression is also adopted by viral RNAs,
which must use the same biological machinery as cellular RNAs. Despite their importance, the
detailed mechanisms that underlie both cellular and viral RNA structure-dependent translational
control are poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose to build on our previous
discoveries of internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNA function by studying two different but
related classes of viral RNAs that interface directly with the cellular translation machinery. The
first comprises a diverse class of viral RNAs called tRNA-like structures (TLSs) that mimic tRNAs
in mysterious ways and use this to bind a variety of cellular proteins; in so doing they enhance
translation by unknown means. As new putative tRNA mimics are being discovered, this work
promises insight of broad applicability. The second are termination upstream ribosome binding
sites (TURBS) RNAs, which exist at the interface between two open reading frames where they
drive ribosome reinitiation using unknown RNA structure. Evidence suggests that RNA sequence
and structure can play an important role in ribosome reinitiation, thus studies of these viral TURBS
promise to reveal foundational principles of this process. For these studies, we propose a
‘structure-forward’ strategy that exploits our substantial expertise in three-dimensional RNA
structure determination, coupled with biochemistry to link structure with function and develop
detailed new mechanistic models. In addition, we will use our structural discoveries to guide novel
bioinformatics searches aimed at finding new versions of these structured elements in both
cellular and viral RNAs. We anticipate that our work will inspire new questions about the nature,
diversity, distribution, and power of RNA structure-dependent control of translation, suggest new
systems to study, and help further understand broad underlying principles."
10884405,"Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness affecting over 57 million
people worldwide. Progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and degeneration of optic nerve axons is
the pathological hallmark of glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) due to dysfunction of trabecular
meshwork (TM) is the most significant and the only known modifiable risk factor for glaucoma. Understanding of
the pathological mechanisms of glaucomatous TM dysfunction and neurodegeneration is limited due to lack of
robust and faithful mouse model that mimics both TM dysfunction and glaucomatous neurodegeneration.
Developing a mouse model of known genetic cause of POAG represents an ideal strategy to understand the
pathophysiology of POAG. Mutations in myocilin (MYOC) gene are the most common genetic cause of POAG.
Using TARGATT site-specific knockin strategy, we developed a Cre-inducible transgenic mice that expresses
DsRed-tagged Y437H mutant of human myocilin (Tg.Cre-MYOCY437H). This technology utilizes serine integrase,
PhiC31 (ΦC31) to insert any gene of interest (a single copy) into a preselected intergenic and transcriptionally
active genomic locus (Hipp11), which has been engineered with a docking site. This allows stable and site-
specific transgene integration. In our preliminary studies, we observed that a single intravitreal injection of helper
adenovirus (HAd) 5 expressing Cre selectively induced human mutant myocilin protein in mouse TM.
Importantly, Ad5.Cre injection resulted in significant and sustained IOP elevation in Tg.Cre-MYOCY437H mice. We
hypothesize that TM-specific expression of mutant myocilin leads significant and pronounced IOP elevation and
glaucomatous neurodegeneration in Tg.Cre-MYOCY437H mice. The major goals of this application are to induce
mutant myocilin expression in TM using HAd5-cre injections and to characterize glaucoma phenotypes of
Tg.Cre-MYOCY437H mice. In Aim 1, we will determine whether HAd5-mediated Cre induces mutant myocilin
expression in TM and elevates IOP in Tg.Cre-MYOCY437H mice. In Aim 2, we will determine whether HAd5-Cre-
induced IOP elevation leads to glaucomatous neurodegeneration in Tg.Cre-MYOCY437H mice. Our proposal will
utilize highly innovative approaches. These include use of efficient and site-specific gene knockin strategy for
generation of transgenic mice, a comprehensive investigation of outflow pathway, RGC functional and structural
loss, optic nerve damage and damage to the visual centers of the brain. Our proposed studies will develop much
needed mouse model of POAG that faithfully replicate all features of glaucoma."
10906838,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are highly prevalent in Latinos, the largest and
fastest-growing minority in the United States (US). Yet, due to financial and cultural inequities, this group is
challenged to afford standard diagnostic and monitoring procedures. Also, research on Latinos lacks scalable,
culturally valid tests and it rarely examines whether potential markers are robust across socio-biological profiles.
Such issues can be tackled with low-cost automated speech and language analyses (ASLA). Participants are
asked to produce natural speech, generating multiple acoustic (sound wave) and linguistic (e.g., semantic) data
that can be digitally extracted and analyzed to identify diseases or predict neurocognitive disruptions. Yet, ASLA
findings are minimal in Latinos. Also, most ASLA studies are small and very few ha differentiated between AD
and FTD variants, compared ASLA with standard measures, accounted for socio-biological factors (e.g., sex,
race, brain profile, bilingualism) or tested for validity across languages and dialects.
This project will develop a novel ASLA framework to jointly address such challenges. To capture socio-biological
diversity and meet requisites for robust machine and deep learning analyses, we will leverage 2740 participants.
These encompass Spanish speakers from five Latin American countries (700 AD, 700 FTD, 800 controls),
English speakers from the US (140 AD, 140 FTD, 160 controls), and US-based Latinos (30 AD, 30 FTD, 40
controls), including the main variants of each disease. This is possible due to a strategic partnership between
UCSF and the Consortium to Expand Dementia Research in Latin America, a multi-funded network bringing a
fully harmonized environment and a large, growing cohort. The Global Brain Health Institute, a dementia training
hub at UCSF, hosts expert clinicians in all sites. Speech and language data will be gleaned through our new
Toolkit to Examine Lifelike Language, a HIPPA-compliant app for speech collection, storage, and visualization,
supported by a language battery and survey. Enrollees are characterized with demographic, clinical, cognitive,
and social determinants of health measures, alongside MRI and fMRI. Our ASLA approach comprises top
predicted markers for each syndrome, added fine-grained features, and embedding features. Novel machine
and deep learning algorithms for high-dimensional settings will be used to pursue three aims.
In Aim 1, we will employ machine and deep learning to reveal the ASLA markers that best identify AD and FTD
syndromes; compare them with cognitive and imaging measures; and test them for generalizability from Spanish
onto English (a typologically different language). In Aim 2, via linear regressions, we will use optimal ASLA
markers to capture syndrome-specific patterns of cognitive dysfunction, brain atrophy, and connectivity. In Aim
3, using high-dimensional machine learning, we will test such markers for validity across diverse socio-biological
profiles, dialects, and bilingual skills (null, low, high). We will forge an affordable, scalable approach to assist
AD and FTD diagnosis in Latinos, at a time when disease-modifying therapies may emerge."
11138871,"Mechanotransduction of cancer cells in the solid tumor environment is an active area of research, yet far less
work has been done to examine the biological behavior of cancer cells in the blood flow environment. Recently,
mechanical stimuli such as shear stress have received attention for their effects on cancer progression. For
instance, studies have shown that shear stress has been associated with enhanced metastasis and cancer cell
death. In the applicant’s laboratory, the synergistic effect of shear stress on tumor necrosis factor-related
apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) was demonstrated, as
well as the unique ability of cancer cells to survive extremely high pulses of shear stress, comparable to blood
cells. These mechanical cues can be translated into biochemical responses in cells through the process of
mechanotransduction. It is proposed to subject cell suspensions to repeated shear stress pulses in a multiwell
plate format to study shear stress response and to develop “mechanoresistant” cell lines that will be
phenotypically and genotypically characterized with the goal of identifying the drivers that enable cancer cells
to survive in circulation. Moreover, given that the presence of CTC aggregates in the blood signal more
aggressive and metastatic disease, multicellular aggregates modeled after aggregates isolated and
characterized from prostate cancer patient blood samples will be tested in vitro for their mechanical responses,
and also used to guide the development of model cells and spheroids to be injected into experimental mouse
models of bloodborne metastasis. This research is organized around three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To
develop a new high throughput device to study the effect of fluid shear stress on cancer cell responses. A
multiwell plate configuration based on a BioJet printer will enable direct analysis with multiwell plate-capable
flow cytometers and spectrophotometers. Calcium influx, membrane and mitochondrial damage, and apoptosis
of cancer cells in response to shear stress signals will be examined, and “mechanoresistant” prostate cancer
cells developed and characterized. Specific Aim 2: To develop the shear flow device and culture conditions to
study shear stress responses modulated by interactions with stromal cells. Circulating tumor cell aggregates
isolated from prostate cancer patient blood samples will be characterized, and used to develop model
aggregates for further study. The stability and survival of heterogeneous tumor cell aggregates in shear flow
will then be studied. Specific Aim 3: To examine the roles of cancer cell mechanosensitization and
mechanoresistance on metastatic tumor burden in vivo. Orthotopic metastasis studies using cells with
modulated shear sensitivity will be performed. Mechanoresistant cancer cells vs. parental cancer cells will be
compared in an experimental mouse model of metastasis, and the fate of injected cell aggregates studied as
well."
10813146,"Project Summary/Abstract
Somatic FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations are associated with a poor prognosis and
increased rates of relapse in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). There is evolving evidence describing
genetic-dependent mechanisms of resistance in FLT3-mutant AML following targeted therapy with
FLT3 inhibitors, including the phenylalanine 691 to leucine (F691L) mutation that has been reported in
patients treated with current generation of FLT3 inhibitors. While AML cells containing this mutation
experience inhibition of kinase activity and canonical FLT3 signaling following exposure to FLT3i
treatment, our preliminary data revealed that FLT3-F691L AML cells continued propagating leukemia
both in vitro and in vivo. The perplexing finding that kinase activity canonical FLT3 signaling is
suppressed, despite ongoing survival of the AML cells, suggested kinase independent signaling
resulting from F691L substitution in FLT3. The long-term goal of this project is understanding the
mechanism of resistance underlying the FLT3-F691L mutation, which we believe is not fully explained
by gatekeeper functionality solely. The specific aims for this project are: (i) determine the effects of
kinase-dependent and -independent signaling in FLT3-ITD and FLT3- F691L AML cells on
differentiation, survival, and gene expression, (ii) identify the pathways and molecules mediating
kinase-independent signaling in FLT3-F691L AML, and (iii) examine novel therapeutic vulnerabilities for
FLT3-F691L AML and evaluate prioritized pharmacologic combination therapy to overcome resistance.
The impact of this grant application is highly significant, as it will have translational implications, filling
an unmet need for relapsed/refractory FLT3 mutant AML. If this mechanism of resistance holds true,
this could inform drug development and combinatorial therapies for various pediatric cancer types in the
long-term."

While transformative, all-oral treatment regimens have recently been endorsed by World Health Organization
(WHO) for the treatment of drug resistant TB (DR -TB), the efficacy of these new regimens is dependent on
prior knowledge of the susceptibility profile of key drugs before treatment initiation. Companion molecular
diagnostics for drug susceptibility testing (DST) of the new and repurposed anti-tuberculosis drugs is the most
likely path to achieving practical and timely DST for these new regimens. However, there are currently no
commercially available molecular diagnostics to detect mutations conferring resistance to bedaquiline,
pretomanid, linezolid or delamanid, nor is there an easy developmental path forward using existing nucleic acid
amplification test (NAAT) approaches given the complexity of the molecular targets for these drugs. Culture-
free, next generation sequencing (NGS) has the greatest potential for delivering a comprehensive diagnostic
solution, but existing workflows are highly complex, expensive, and rely on highly skilled staff to run them. To
achieve broad adoption of NGS approaches, particularly in low resource settings, these workflows must be
simplified substantially to reduce both their complexity and cost. Our goals for the proposed study are to bring
culture-free NGS closer to patient care by simplifying NGS workflows for DR-TB diagnosis to the point that
NGS can be run mostly hands-free by any laboratorian who can run a NAAT and to reduce costs by removing
several enzymatic processes. Our objective is to demonstrate that automated, single amplification sequencing
(ASAS) can be used to accurately diagnose resistance to all legacy and new/repurposed drugs for which there
are recognized molecular targets (i.e., isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, amikacin, moxifloxacin, bedaquiline,
clofazimine, linezolid, and delamanid). We will achieve this objective by completing the following three aims;
Aim 1) Expand with additional gene targets an existing single amplification targeted NGS assay and describe
the assay performance; Aim 2) Integrate an existing Akonni sputum extraction/PCR workstation with our novel
single amplification sequencing assay and sequence on Illumina iSeq100; and Aim 3) Evaluate the accuracy of
the ASAS solution for detection of drug resistance against a phenotypic and genotypic reference standard in
sputum samples from patients at risk for DR-TB under field conditions at clinical laboratories in India, South
Africa, and Moldova. The results of this project will demonstrate key characteristics of the ASAS workflow and
will provide a solid developmental foundation for the application of this tool in clinical settings, reducing cost
and time-to-result for comprehensive DST without culturing."
10844568,"ABSTRACT
Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is the most common clinical pain condition worldwide, and the top
chronic non-cancer condition for which opioids are prescribed. The current opioid crisis in the
U.S. emerged in large part from overuse and misuse of opioids by patients with cLBP. Yet, there
are few evidence-based interventions to reduce opioid use and misuse among patients with
cLBP. Faced with a lack of effective treatment options, some cLBP patients become ensnared
in a downward spiral of opioid dose escalation. Mindfulness-based interventions reduce chronic
pain and opioid dosing. However, lack of mechanistic data has limited the deployment of these
cost-effective and non-pharmacological treatment approaches. Multiple clinical trials indicate
that Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), a novel mind-body therapy that
integrates mindfulness with other affect regulation techniques, alleviates chronic pain symptoms
as well as opioid use among people with cLBP. Yet, the active brain mechanisms of action
underlying MORE’s analgesic and opioid sparing effects remain unknown. Further, no known
placebo-controlled studies have disentangled the specific neural mechanisms of MORE or other
mindfulness-based interventions for cLBP from nonspecific therapeutic factors like beliefs,
expectancy, and social support. As such, the proposed study will employ one of the most
rigorous control conditions in the mindfulness literature to date—a validated sham-mindfulness
meditation technique combined with supportive psychotherapy (Sham-MORE). Integrating
functional neuroimaging and psychophysics (noxious heat and behavioral pain ratings), the
overarching aims of the proposed R01 study are to a) identify the neural mechanisms
supporting the immediate analgesic effects of MORE (versus Sham-MORE and treatment-as-
usual), and b) to determine if changes in default mode network functional connectivity predict
individual differences in cLBP relief and opioid dose reduction following treatment with MORE.
Ultimately, the proposed work will yield insight into the fundamental neuro-functional processes
mediating the therapeutic effects of mindfulness-based interventions for cLBP, thereby
facilitating the optimization of novel biobehavioral treatments for this highly prevalent and
disabling chronic pain condition that helped to fuel the ongoing opioid crisis."
10844575,"Understanding the roles of cardiac NAD+ pools and therapeutic effects of precursor supplements in
heart failure
We are exploring the hypothesis that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolism can be targeted
to improve functional capacity in failing human hearts. NAD+ is a ubiquitous molecule that is required as a
redox cofactor or substrate for hundreds of enzymes within the cell. It is derived from dietary tryptophan,
niacin, nicotinamide, or synthetic intermediates, but the majority of synthesis in the heart is via nicotinamide.
NAD+ concentration falls in failing human hearts and in some rodent models of heart failure. High doses of
precursors including nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) have therapeutic
effects in rodent models. However, the doses used exceed what is tolerable in humans and the potential for
effects at human-relevant doses remains uncertain. Our preliminary and published results suggest that high
doses of NR and NMN may be required in rodent models because both molecules are extensively metabolized
in the intestines and liver when delivered orally, with only a tiny fraction reaching the circulation intact. In
contrast, intravenous delivery allows a much higher proportion of the dose to reach organs such as the heart.
In addition to questions about dosing, the mechanism of protection has remained unclear. It is presumed to
involve cardiac NAD+ levels, but whole-body supplementation studies leave open the possibility that other
tissues mediate protection, for example through lowering blood pressure. We present a knockout mouse with
cardiomyocyte-specific loss of NAD+ that impairs heart function and propose the generation of a new model
to specifically test the role of mitochondrial NAD+ within the cardiomyocytes. This will be accomplished by
targeting SLC25A51, which we recently identified as the mitochondrial NAD+ transporter. We propose three
specific aims: Aim 1) Test whether heart-specific NAD+ depletion is sufficient to recapitulate the metabolic
and electrical consequences of heart failure, Aim 2) Test whether alternate delivery routes can allow cardiac
NAD+ to be rescued by low, human-relevant doses in mice, and Aim 3) Test whether altering mitochondrial
NAD+ is sufficient to modulate heart function on its own or modifies susceptibility to induced heart failure. Our
approach of using AAV to target SLC25A51 expression in the heart will be the first time that modulation of
this protein to alter the mitochondrial NAD+ pool has been attempted in vivo. Together, these studies will
reveal fundamental details of how NAD+ metabolism influences cardiac physiology, and will help guide efforts
to develop novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment or prevention of heart failure in human patients."
10844578,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diseases of the biliary system comprise a significant percentage of the indications for liver transplantation in
adult and pediatric populations. The pathogenesis of these disorders likely involves cellular responses to the
harmful effects of bile, to which epithelial cells lining the bile ducts are continuously exposed. Bile toxicity arises
largely from the oxidative damage caused by bile salts, whose detergent properties disrupt intracellular
organelles, particularly mitochondria. Bile duct epithelial cells, also known as cholangiocytes, have evolved
strategies for preventing bile toxicity in addition to having robust anti-oxidant defense systems, which are present
in all cells to combat reactive oxygen species generated during normal metabolism.
Work from my laboratory using the zebrafish system has identified regional susceptibilities of cholangiocytes to
redox stress imparted by the plant toxin biliatresone, whose consumption is associated with epidemic biliary
atresia (BA) in livestock. Our most recent studies indicate a comparable role for regional variantion in heat shock
mediated proteostasis in cholangiocytes exposed to biliatresone, and that these responses can be modified by
the activation of cGMP signaling. Importantly, there is compelling clinical data indicating the modulation of stress
responses contributes to risk and outcomes in human BA, thus validating the biliatresone models we employ.
The goal of this proposal is to study the mechanisms responsible for the variation in cholangiocyte stress
responses using zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models. In Aim 1, we will characterize the molecular
determinants of the redox stress response in zebrafish intra-hepatic and extra-hepatic cholangiocytes, determine
whether variation in these responses evolve from epigenetic factors that arise during biliary development, and
correlate these findings with mammalian cholangiocyte biology using mouse models. In Aim 2, we will identify
the cellular targets responsible for biliatresone-induced injury and stress in mammalian cholangiocytes using two
approaches; first, via pull-down experiments using photo-activatable biliatresone analog; second, by conducting
a genome-wide CRISPR positive selection screen for genes required for biliatresone toxicity. In Aim 3, we will
explore links between cGMP signaling and proteostasis and how this affects susceptibility of cholangiocyte to
injury using three approaches: first, by defining the downstream regulators of cGMP signaling that mediate its
inhibition of biliatresone toxicity, second, by correlating these data with a comprehensive analysis of the
cholangiocyte proteome, and how it is modified by biliatresone and cGMP signaling, third, defining the sub-

Alzheimer’s Disease Pathology Across Aging. Our laboratory and others find adolescent intermittent ethanol
(AIE; 2-days EtOH/2-days NO EtOH during adolescence) primes and accelerates adult Alzheimer’s disease
(AD)-related degeneration and cognitive deficits that persist in the absence of continued adult EtOH exposure.
Our premise for this proposal is built on priming of common mechanisms of pathology, including chronic
neuroinflammation and loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs). This proposal will test the
overarching hypothesis that AIE-induced persistent, life-long loss of BFCNs and chronic
neuroinflammation contribute to the onset and progression of AD-associated neuropathology and
cognitive decline across aging. This hypothesis is built on our preliminary findings, including (1) AIE increase
of receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) and other neuroinflammatory molecules, induction of
AD-associated genes, and reductions of BFCNs, hippocampal neurogenesis, and cognitive function in
adulthood; (2) increased RAGE-neuroinflammation and AD-like pathology in post-mortem human AUD brain
samples of individuals with an adolescent age of drinking onset. We recently discovered that AIE accelerates
adult BFCN neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) in a genetic mouse
model of AD. We developed an innovative mouse model using the 5xFAD genetic mouse model of AD, which
recapitulates the dual Aβ accumulation and neurodegeneration observed in human AD, crossbred with ChAT-
Cre mice to investigate interactions of AIE with Aβ accumulation across aging on BFCN and hippocampal
pathology. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that AIE accelerates AD-associated neuropathology in the aging
brain of ChAT-Cre::5xFAD mice. We expect AIE will accelerate neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and
AD-associated pathology across ages. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that AIE-induced basal forebrain RAGE-
neuroinflammatory signaling causes BFCN loss, neuroimmune signaling, AD pathology, and cholinergic
dysfunction in the aging brain of ChAT-Cre::5xFAD mice. AIE induces RAGE-neuroinflammatory signaling
and loss of BFCNs that persists into adulthood. We expect RAGE-neuroinflammatory signaling contributes to
AD-associated BFCN pathology. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that chronic activation of basal forebrain
cholinergic activity during AIE prevents loss of hippocampal activity, neurogenesis, and cognitive
function, and reduces AD-associated neuropathology in the aging brain of ChAT-Cre::5xFAD mice. AIE
increases hippocampal neuroinflammation, reduces neurogenesis, and impairs cognition in adulthood that is
prevented by anti-cholinesterase drugs. We expect BFCN activation to both identify cholinergic involvement and
recover AD-associated hippocampal pathology. The proposed studies will link early life insults (i.e., adolescent
binge drinking) to AD-like neurodegeneration and dementia in the aging brain, and identify potential therapeutics."
10845097,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF CANCER (MMC)
The overarching goal of the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC)
Molecular Mechanisms of Cancer (MMC) Program is to catalyze collaborative efforts that leverage
emerging scientific discoveries from the laboratories of MMC scientists and propel them in a translational
direction that makes an impact on cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for patients living in our
catchment area and beyond. The University of Chicago is a hotbed of scientific innovation, and the MMC
continues to maximize the health benefits that emerge from this science, informed by the people most
affected by cancer in our community. The MMC Program is centered on three key scientific and cancer-
focused research themes: (1) deregulated gene expression and epigenetic defects in cancer; (2) altered
cell growth and transformation; and (3) the tumor microenvironment in tumor growth and metastasis. These
intersecting themes encompass the research of all members, across organ sites. The breadth and multi-
disciplinary nature of our research contributes to the success of MMC in establishing productive
translational collaborations both within MMC and across the other UCCCC programs. The MMC Program
consists of 51 faculty members from 13 Departments, including 14 talented new faculty recruited to the
institution in this funding cycle. In addition to increasing membership by 38% in this cycle, we increased
the number and percentage of high-impact publications from 20% to 38% of total publications, increased
NCI funding from $3.5M to $5M and launched 6 new working groups and multiple team science initiatives.
Importantly, we have had increased success in moving our cutting-edge science into clinical trials, clinical
applications, and/or commercialization. MMC leadership has fostered these successes by enhancing inter-
programmatic collaborations, particularly with the UCCCC Clinical & Experimental Therapeutics Program
via new working groups and targeted funding. Our work has a bidirectional relationship with the residents
of our catchment area, who are negatively impacted by disparities in cancer incidence and mortality rates.
Our work is informed by the community through multiple channels. In turn, our faculty and trainees are
engaged in numerous educational and outreach opportunities to support our community. In this cycle, MMC
will advance diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts by continuing to build an inclusive environment,
increasing racial and gender diversity, and developing and retaining underrepresented minorities and
women. Fostering the next generation of cancer researchers through extensive and interwoven education
and training is a recognized hallmark of the MMC program that ensures our mission to reduce cancer
burden and disparities."

10843947,"ABSTRACT
Noncoding genetic variation that alters gene regulation is of paramount importance for health, disease, and
evolution. Diseases ranging in incidence from the most common to the most rare all have substantial risk
associated with regulatory variation; and most of the genetic differences between closely related species are
noncoding. Whole genome sequencing can directly identify that variation but to realize its potential to elucidate
the genetic determinants of health and disease, will require accurate annotation of this noncoding variation for
functionality. In coding sequence, the genetic code allows variants to be annotated to a rough hierarchy of likely
functional effects and pathogenicity. In noncoding sequence such annotation is less clear. Perturbation assays,
i.e., assays that modify genetic or epigenetic states and measure the effect of those perturbations on regulatory
endpoints, offer a possible path to annotating noncoding variation. However, to fully leverage this data, novel
and sophisticated statistical and machine learning approaches are required to extract useful information from
those assays, to integrate that information across regulatory endpoints, and to extrapolate findings so that
annotation of previously unobserved (unperturbed) variation in diverse cell types is possible. The goal of the
Duke Prediction Center is to develop the analytic approaches and tools that will allow for the routine
annotation of noncoding variation for functionality and ultimately pathogenicity. Aim 1 is to establish best
practices in perturbation assay design and analysis. This will allow IGVF characterization centers design their
experiments so that, when coupled with optimized analyses, the data produced will be maximally informative for
subsequent predictive modeling. Aim 2 is to develop novel mechanistic machine learning approaches for
predicting the functional effect of noncoding variation on function in diverse cell-types. Aim 3 is to identify
noncoding genomic regions that are subject to functional constraint which will be leveraged in prioritizing variants
for pathogenicity. The expected outcomes of this project will be (i) robust estimates of optimal experimental
design parameters and recommendations for analysis tools and best practices for the various assays used within
the IGVF consortium, (ii) predicted functional effects of observed variation to be shared through the IGVF
variant/phenotype catalog as well as a state-of-the-art machine learning method (and associated tools) that can
identify previously-unknown interactions among genomic variants, both observed and novel, and predict their
functional impact in diverse cell types, and (iii) a list of regulatory elements subject to functional constraint shared
through the IGVF variant/phenotype catalog and a principled prioritization framework (and associated tools) for
interpreting variation within patient genomes for pathogenicity. Due to the considerable success of genetics,
there are thousands of unknown regulatory causes of disease. Each of those causes is an opportunity to improve
treatment, diagnostics, or prevention. This project will be a major advance towards unlocking that potential."

The human brain is active all the time. Spontaneous brain activity is richly structured across space and time, and
disruption of its organization carries serious clinical consequences. Yet, how spontaneous brain activity
participates in online brain functioning remains an open question. In the perceptual domain, it is well established
that prestimulus spontaneous activity can influence perceptual outcome, but exactly how it participates in
stimulus and perceptual processing remains poorly understood. This gap in knowledge hinders our ability to
explain and treat perceptual disturbances in a wide range of clinical disorders. The proposed project aims to
close this gap.
Two competing hypotheses about the functional mechanisms of spontaneous brain activity have been proposed:
one proposes that it carries specific functional information shaped by previous sensory experiences; the other
suggests that it largely reflects nonspecific changes in arousal or behavioral states. Recent work from our
laboratory provided evidence that both hypotheses are correct and, in fact, two separate spontaneous processes
coexist in the human brain that influence perception in a content-specific and a non-content-specific manner. In
addition, these two spontaneous processes appear to have doubly dissociable influences on perceptual outcome,
impacting sensitivity and criterion, respectively. These preliminary findings point to a novel, unifying framework
for conceptualizing the functional (dual) role of spontaneous brain activity in perception.
Here, we combine two advanced human brain imaging technologies with complementary spatial and temporal
resolution—7-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography—to test this new
framework and address several urgent questions. Aim 1 (Anatomy): Which brain structures generate
perceptually relevant content-specific and non-content-specific spontaneous brain activity? Aim 2 (Modality
specificity): Which components of perceptually relevant spontaneous activity are constrained within a sensory
modality and which components are shared across sensory modalities? Aim 3 (Cognition): Does perceptually
relevant spontaneous activity have shared neural substrate with task-specific anticipatory brain activity?
Answering these questions will reveal the neural underpinnings and functional mechanisms of perceptually
relevant spontaneous brain activity.
The proposed research will shed light on how spontaneous brain activity shapes perceptual processing and lay
the foundation for a more mechanistic understanding of perceptual disturbances in a variety of neuropsychiatric
illnesses. Our innovative approach will test a novel framework that has the potential to unify current competing
theories and combine two complementary, cutting-edge technologies to monitor human brain activity. This work
will advance knowledge of how spontaneous activity is involved in brain functions and produce insights that help
to refine theories on perception."
10894025,"Abstract
The standard approach to TB control relies on detection and treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
disease. This approach may have limited effectiveness in areas where the high burden of TB leads to high
levels of transmission. To curb the TB epidemic, new cases must be prevented. Preventive therapy is an
effective intervention as it reduces the risk of progression to disease by 65 – 85% in both HIV-positive (HIV+)
and negative (HIV-) individuals. A monumental challenge still remains: one-quarter of the world's population is
infected with Mtb. Treating all individuals with LTBI is not feasible: a strategy to identify those at highest risk for
progression to TB is required. Contacts who are newly infected experience a period of high risk for progressive
disease that lasts about 2 to 3 yrs. Our recent cohort study in urban Uganda measured the annual rate of Mtb
infection in the community as close to 10%/yr. For most individuals with latent Mtb infection (LTBI), the timing
of infection is unknown and biomarkers of recent infection would help identify persons at greatest risk for
disease progression. A proteomic analysis of serum from TB household contacts who converted their
tuberculin skin test (TST) identified a protein signature for new Mtb infection. Improving upon this signature and
determining its use in the community to identify persons who recently developed LTBI would allow for targeted
preventive therapy and “halt Mtb transmission”. The overall hypothesis for this proposal is that serum/plasma
biomarker signatures of new Mtb infection can identify HIV+ and HIV- adults in high Mtb transmission areas
and targeting these individuals for preventive therapy will reduce TB and Mtb transmission in the community.
There are 3 aims. Aim 1 will test and enhance a host protein signature as biomarker for new Mtb infection in
HIV-infected and non-infected persons. We will use plasma collected in an ongoing TB household contact
study in Kampala, Uganda in which TST-/IGRA- HIV+ and HIV- adults are enrolled and followed for IGRA/TST
conversion. We will determine if serum cytokines enhance the predictive accuracy of this protein signature.
Aim 2 will identify new Mtb infection in high risk environments in an urban African setting. GPS tracking
technology will be used to trace and longitudinally map subjects to locate areas of high Mtb transmission, i.e.
“hot-spots”. Subjects will be enrolled and followed for IGRA/TST conversion every 3 months over 1 yr with
serial sampling of plasma. Aim 3 will determine if the protein signature(s) developed in Aim 1 can identify new
Mtb infections in the community. This project builds on more than 20 years of experience by this investigative
team studying Mtb transmission in TB households and community in Kampala, Uganda, and host responses to
Mtb infection and disease in HIV+ and HIV- persons. This proposal brings together expertise in Mtb
epidemiology (Drs. Whalen, Kiwanuka, Joloba, Stein), immunology (Drs. Mayanja, Boom) and biomarker
development (Drs. Bark, Paramithiotis) at CWRU, Makerere University, University of Georgia, and Caprion Inc."
10909970,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diarrheal diseases mediated by infectious enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) that produce heat-stable
enterotoxins (ST) are one of the significant causes of morbidity in developing countries, with children below 5
being the most severely affected. Children infected with these strains show moderate-to-severe diarrhea but face
the greatest long-term morbidity and increased risk of death. There are currently no directed therapies against
stable toxin-mediated diarrhea, but oral administration of zinc salts has proven to be beneficial.
 The long-term goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms of how chronic cGMP-driven
increases susceptibility to enteric bacterial pathogens. ST binds to the cell surface receptor guanylyl cyclase C
(GC-C, encoded by GUCY2C), expressed in all cell types in the gut but not immune cells. We
previously described and characterized hyperactivating mutations in the GUCY2C and generated knock-in mice
that display elevated intestinal cGMP and diarrhea. Our studies show that these mice display MSD-like
phenotypes. Therefore, we hypothesize that these mice could serve as a pre-clinical model to understand the gut
environment seen in children with prolonged episodes of ST-mediated diarrhea. These mice show an interferon-
driven intestinal gene signature and Paneth cell defects. We propose to pursue the following objectives and
questions in this proposal: (1) Elucidate mechanisms by which the Paneth cell dysfunction seen in transgenic
mice occurs at the molecular level using engineered cell lines and organoid cultures; (2) study mechanistic
aspects of Stat1 induction, and inflammation in transgenic mice; (3) Monitor the recruitment and maturation of
the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) during cGMP-mediated diarrhea characterize and (4) ask whether a
prevailing condition of diarrhea induces a more severe response to further infection by enteropathogenic E.
coli (EPEC). Oral administration of zinc sulfate is known to shorten diarrheal episodes in affected children.
Therefore, we will incorporate zinc administration in animals to attempt to reverse inflammation and other
detrimental phenotypes seen in transgenic mice.
 Collectively, using these transgenic mice to understand infectious secretory diarrhea will not only
elucidate the underlying changes that occur in the gut during prolonged secretory diarrhea but also reveal targets
for therapy (e.g., zinc) in alleviating symptoms. Furthermore, our studies will identify vulnerabilities that could
be targeted to ensure that co-infection with another bacterial pathogen has minimal impact."
10897186,"SUMMARY
The discovery and development of fluorescent proteins and optogenetics revolutionized biology by making it
possible to image and control specific cellular processes with visible light. While these tools have enabled
countless biological discoveries, the poor penetration of light into living tissue makes it difficult to use optical
techniques in intact animals. As a result, biological phenomena ranging from the signaling of neurons in deep-
brain regions, to the infiltration of immune cells into tumors, to the microbial colonization of the GI tract, are
challenging to study within their natural in vivo context. If instead of light it were possible to visualize and
manipulate cellular function using a more penetrant form of energy such as ultrasound, this would open
previously inaccessible domains of in vivo biology to direct investigation. In addition, it would enhance the
development of cell-based therapies by allowing cellular agents to be seen and controlled after administration
into the human body. The physics of ultrasound make it an ideal modality for deep-tissue cellular communication.
Sound waves in the MHz range are weakly scattered by tissue and can therefore penetrate several cm into the
body. With wavelengths on the order of 100 µm and travel times < 1 ms, ultrasound can access many key
structures and processes. When focused, sound waves can deliver mechanical and thermal energy to precise
anatomical locations. These properties have already made ultrasound one of the world’s most widely used
technologies for medical imaging and non-invasive surgery. However, the potential of ultrasound to serve as a
tool for cellular imaging and control has been relatively untapped due to a lack of methods to connect it to the
function of specific cells and biomolecules. In previous work, the Shapiro lab has pioneered the use of ultrasound
in cellular and molecular imaging by developing the first acoustic reporter genes and biosensors for ultrasound,
aiming to “do for ultrasound what fluorescent proteins have done for fluorescence microscopy”. The major goal
of our proposed new research direction is to “do for ultrasound what optogenetics has done for light” by giving
sound waves the ability to control specific cellular functions such as neuronal excitation, gene expression and
intracellular signaling in vivo. The basic principle of our approach is to (1) use focused ultrasound to deposit
acoustic energy at a specific location in tissue, (2) use genetically encoded “acoustic antennae” to convert this
energy into local mechanical force, and (3) use this force to actuate mechanosensitive receptors to produce
specific cellular signals. We will implement this approach in neurons and immune cells to enable unique
neuroscience and cell therapy applications. If successful, this work will help establish the new field of
sonogenetics by providing researchers and clinicians with the unprecedented ability to “point and click” on cells
deep within the body and tell them what to do."

Sciences (UZFMHS) is the lead centre for medical research in Zimbabwe. Currently there is a dearth of
researchers to address priority NCDs in Zimbabwe and sub-Saharan Africa in general. To address this gap
this application will establish the ENRICH program (Enhancing Non-communicable diseases Research and
Innovation Capacity in Harare, Zimbabwe) to train a critical mass of Investigators at the UZFMHS to become
proficient in NCD research. Research training and capacity building will be conducted in Cardiovascular
Diseases, Pulmonary Diseases, Hematology, Stroke and Neurological Diseases, Aging and Dental and
Craniofacial Diseases. The long-term goal is to generate evidence for interventions to improve care for people
with NCDs in Zimbabwe and sub-Saharan Africa. The objectives of the program are to:
1. To train entry level graduate trainees up to post-Doc trainees to undertake high level research on NCDs
 in Zimbabwe.
2. Identify high research priority topics across the lifespan in selected NCDs to provide the research scope
 for the ENRICH program.
3. To establish mentoring relationships between trainees and dedicated and experienced mentors using
 rigorous selection criteria.
4. Strengthen research dissemination and knowledge translation to inform policy and practice.
The ENRICH program will be implemented by UZFMHS faculty assisted by faculty from regional and
international partners i.e. WITS University and University of Colorado Denver respectively. In addition, the
program will collaborate with UZFMHS affiliated research centers such as AiBST, UZ-CRC, UZ-CTRC, BRTI
among others. The research training in the chosen scientific NCD areas have been selected because of the
national and institutional importance/interest and the opportunity to address research deficiencies in those
areas. The program will consist of integrated training framework involving long term degrees (Masters, PhDs,
post-Docs), medium term technical courses and didactic short term courses. These formal training activities
will be supported by mentorship and mentored projects. In addition, trainees will undertake attachments and
electives at the affiliated research entities and UCD. The period of training vary with the level of training i.e.
2 years for Masters and Post-doctorals and 3 and half years for PhDs. The program will recruit 8 PhDs, 8
Masters and 4 post-Docs over a period of 5 years."
10676285,"Abstract
 Human infancy is characterized by extraordinary maturation of brain function and structure with the
highest change rate across the life span. These dynamic brain processes are supported by significant
increases in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) to meet the metabolic demands of rapid brain growth during
infancy. Devastating brain disorders such as cerebral ischemia and stroke also occur in infancy and their short-
and long-term consequences are manifested by changes in rCBF and function around the injured brain site
and connected areas. A standardized whole-brain population-averaged three-dimensional (3D) developmental
perfusion atlas of rCBF would have a broad impact on understanding not only normal infant brain development
but also brain disorders. Without a normal reference, it is not possible to detect disorders that alter rCBF.
Despite its significant impact, to date, the rCBF atlas and trajectory of infant brain are not available. The goal is
to establish the first age-specific whole-brain population-averaged 3D infant perfusion atlases and trajectories
quantified by rCBF measures, as well as to delineate their functional and behavioral correlations. To adapt to
relatively small infant brain, high-resolution (2.5x2.5x2.5mm3) rCBF will be obtained noninvasively using a
novel arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI technique (Aim 1-2), providing absolute quantification of a
fundamental property of brain physiology. We will also systematically delineate the mechanistic relationship
between infant rCBF dynamics and the maturation of corresponding brain function and behavior (Aim 3).
These atlases will serve as a diagnostic screening tool by providing normal rCBF distribution and variability
(e.g. z-sore maps) at multiple critical infant developmental stages as well as fill the neuroscientific knowledge
gap of lacking fundamental brain physiological properties. ASL perfusion MRI uses magnetically labeled
arterial blood water protons as an endogenous tracer. A recently developed 3D spiral ASL MRI method uses
pseudo-continuous labeling (pCASL) with background suppression, a 3D stack-of-spiral readout and parallel
imaging, making it possible to establish the high-quality infant rCBF atlas at resolution of 2.5x2.5x2.5mm3 or
higher. This study will leverage two funded projects (R01HD093776 and R01MH092535) that will provide
resources of recruitment and behavioral assessment of a relatively large infant cohort at the Children’s Hospital
of Philadelphia. After optimizing the 3D spiral pCASL perfusion MRI sequence for infants, we will use the
optimized sequence to acquire data from healthy infants at 0.5, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months (n=232 at initial
time point) for making age-specific population-averaged atlases. The resulting high-quality and high-resolution
age-specific whole brain perfusion atlases, the longitudinal maturational curves of rCBF, as well as individual
dataset will be the first for infants, and will be valuable shared resources. The brain regions-of-interests where
rCBF change is highly correlated with functional or behavioral maturation may also be used as prognostic
biomarkers for predicting altered function and behavior in infants with brain disorders."
10902020,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by a rapid decline in kidney filtration, and if left untreated can lead to
kidney failure. It is estimated there are 600,000 new cases of AKI each year, however, beyond careful
medication selection and supportive hemodynamic optimization, there is currently no approved therapy. An
innovative approach to halt, and possibly reverse, the progression of AKI is to use mesenchymal stem cell
(MSC) based therapies. MSCs act as a “mobile drug store” to protect and regenerate damaged cells through
anti-inflammatory, angiogenic, immunomodulatory, anti-fibrotic and anti-apoptotic factors, which are released
either in a soluble form or within extracellular vesicles (EVs). In recent work, we have shown that both parent
MSCs (i.e. a cellular therapy) and MSC-derived EVs (i.e. a cell-free therapy) can improve animal survival and
kidney function following AKI, by modulating the heat shock protein (HSP) pathway. Although MSC based
therapies have shown considerable promise in preclinical models of AKI, their clinical translation has been
suboptimal. A major reason for this is that these therapies cannot reach the injured kidney when given to
patients by conventional intravenous (IV) administration, with majority of parent MSCs getting trapped in the
lungs and MSC-derived EVs getting trapped in the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Hence, we will examine if
we can optimize MSC therapies by delivering them directly into the injured kidney by intra-arterial (IA) injection.
We will also investigate the effect of a novel technology which uses sound waves, called pulsed focused
ultrasound (pFUS), on both MSC therapies and the injured kidney given that it can (i) stimulate MSCs, (ii)
modulate the kidney microenvironment by creating a “molecular zip-code to facilitate MSC homing and
retention, and/or (iii) independently stimulate the HSP pathway to facilitate kidney regeneration. Focused
ultrasound is an FDA-approved technology which is currently used clinically, albeit not for this indication. We
will use a mouse model of AKI and GMP grade human bone marrow derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) from which we
also derive EVs – given that MSC based therapies for all our experiments will be derived from a single source,
this will allow for experimental reproducibility and enable our results to be compared across all our aims. In
Aim 1, we will examine how sound waves affect BM-MSCs, as well as the acutely injured kidney, at a
molecular level. In Aims 2 and 3, we will compare IV administration of either parent BM-MSCs or BM-MSC
derived EVs, with locoregional IA administration directly into the kidneys - a technique developed by our Lab
that mimics what Interventional Radiologists can perform in humans using minimally invasive image guided
endovascular techniques. Next, we will determine how MSC based therapies modulate the molecular pathways
involved in kidney regeneration, focusing specifically on HSPs. Finally, we will examine whether pFUS can
optimize the regenerative capacity of MSC therapies in the context of AKI."

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2; CoV2) is the first highly pathogenic and
highly transmissible human coronavirus that is the causative agent for the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. As
of November 2020, 50 million cases of CoV2 infection worldwide and 1.25 million deaths have been reported.
The U.S. accounts for the majority of cases, 9.7 million (20%) and deaths 235,000 (19%), and COVID-19 is
expected to add an $8 trillion burden to the U.S. health care system. A particularly challenging aspect of
clinical management is the variable patient response to CoV2 infection. Some infected individuals report few
symptoms whereas others display severe disease characterized by hypoxia, acute respiratory distress
syndrome, and multi-organ involvement that can lead to death. A pro-inflammatory ‘cytokine storm’ in COVID-
19 patients promotes derangements in vascular function and blood composition. Elevated fibrinogen and D-
dimer (the breakdown product of fibrin clots) track with significant elevations inflammatory markers (e.g., IL-6,
C-reactive protein), which significantly and positively correlate with poor patient outcomes. Autopsy studies of
COVID-19 patients have revealed intravascular and extravascular fibrin deposits in lung tissue and other organ
systems. A current critical knowledge gap is the molecular basis of how persistent fibrin deposits develop and
whether they are functionally linked to the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19 disease. Our central
hypothesis that an insufficiency in the plasminogen activation (PA) system is a trigger point for transition of
COVID-19 from mild to severe disease due accumulating, proinflammatory, and tissue-damaging fibrin
deposits within the lung and other organ systems. To test this hypothesis, our research team developed a
mouse-adapted CoV2 virus that replicates key immunological and hematological aspects of COVID-19 in
humans. This unique tool will be used in conjunction with mice carrying single or combined deficiencies or
functional mutations in fibrinogen or PA system components to define the natural course of hemostatic
changes following infection and elucidate functional contributions of coagulation and fibrinolytic factors to the
host response. Specifically, we will determine (i) the differences in local and systemic activity of host factors
that control fibrin(ogen) deposition, stabilization, and dissolution following mild vs. severe CoV2 infection; (ii)
how PA deficiency promotes severe disease following CoV2 infection characterized by exacerbation of local
and systemic inflammatory, organ damage, and host mortality; and (iii) the mechanisms linking fibrin(ogen) to
exacerbation of host inflammatory responses and induction of severe disease following CoV2 infection. The
proposed studies will provide novel insights into the contribution of the plasminogen/fibrinogen axis to the
CoV2 pathobiology, illuminate key mechanisms coupling deficiencies in PA system components to CoV2-
mediated thrombophilia, tissue damage, and loss of organ function, and provide essential proof-of-principle
data to facilitate translation of findings into new treatments for COVID-19."
10836994,"ABSTRACT
Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is an important risk factor that may arise years before the onset of vascular
contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). cSVD is characterized by in-vivo neuroimaging
biomarkers including enlarged perivascular spaces (ePVS). PVS are the site of interchange between interstitial
fluid and cerebrospinal fluid which is believed to play a role in the removal of brain waste. Reduced clearance
may lead to enlargement of the PVS and subsequent accumulation of toxic solutes characteristic of
neurodegeneration. Given their presence in brain regions that support cognition, we hypothesize that
quantitative, cross-sectional ePVS counts in cognitively normal older adults could serve as an early biomarker
of VCID. Specifically, we anticipate ePVS will predict cognitive dysfunction and increased white matter lesion
burden after three years. We will test this hypothesis in a cohort of 121 cognitively normal older adults ranging
in age from 60-86 at baseline. Participants are scanned on a 3T Siemens Prisma magnetic resonance imaging
scanner with a 64-channel head coil. ePVS are manually counted by an experienced rater blinded to participant
demographics following consensus guidelines using T1 MPRAGE, T2 FLAIR, and Quantitative Susceptibility
Mapping images. All ePVS are counted in a single, axial slice of four brain regions with high ePVS burden
including the centrum semiovale (CS ePVS), basal ganglia (BG ePVS), hippocampus, and midbrain. Aim 1 will
test the hypothesis that CS ePVS predict longitudinal changes in executive function, a specific cognitive domain
affected in VCID. Our preliminary data using the same cohort include a negative relationship between CS ePVS
and baseline Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, a standardized screening tool of global cognition.
Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that baseline CS ePVS burden predicts increased deep white matter hyperintensity
(WMH) volume in the centrum semiovale after three years. This expands on preliminary findings that CS ePVS
are positively related to whole brain WMH volume, a marker of advanced cSVD. In Aim 3, regional
cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), a measure of microvascular dysfunction, will be analyzed using a novel BOLD-
fMRI testing paradigm, as a potential mechanistic contributor of ePVS. The cross-sectional relationship between
BG ePVS and basal ganglia CVR will be analyzed to capitalize on our preliminary data which show a negative
relationship between BG ePVS and global CVR. We will further test an alternative hypothesis that the
cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta 42/40 ratio, a biomarker of amyloid burden, is more closely associated with
ePVS than CVR. These experiments will be carried out at the University of Kentucky Magnetic Resonance and
Imaging Center and the Sanders-Brown Center on Aging, under the direction of an expert team of scientist and

10874462,"PROJECT SUMMARY
About 3.5–5.9% of the world population could be affected by a rare disease, corresponding
proportionally to 3.79–6.39 million people in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The
distribution of rare diseases is not uniform across countries or sub-populations. This uneven
distribution suggests that each country or region should determine the frequency and
distribution rare diseases within its borders and develop a prevention, screening,
management, and advocacy plan.
Interestingly, knowledge generated in one country or region is highly important in advancing
genomic medicine in other countries as well. African data are underrepresented in the vast
majority of reputable databases. Since the ability to make discoveries increases with data,
this paucity of African data prevents discoveries in Africa and improvement of diagnostic and
care for rare diseases patients.
Besides, African countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are in a very
good momentum. First, the genomic diversity is higher in Africa. Second, the technological
barriers are being broken with the advent of the Cloud and the deployment of bioinformatics
tools and other resources in the Cloud. Third, the mobile internet has been broadly deployed
in the DRC and other Sub-Saharan countries, which is facilitating access to high computing
resources in the Cloud and removing the need for heavy local infrastructure or senior
bioinformaticians to conduct bioinformatics analysis in Sub-Saharan countries. Finally, the
expertise for rare diseases genomics has increased significantly in DRC, leading to multiple
research projects involving the analysis of genomic data being performed in the center for
human genetics of the University of Kinshasa.
However, poor quality data leads to wrong policies. An effort still needs to be made in building
networks to increase the quality and volume of data. This requires the harmonization of tools
and procedures for data collection and processing.
The African Rare Diseases Initiative (ARDI) is designed to be a model of how a Sub-Saharan
African country may become ready to enter the genomic medicine era and make significant
contributions to global genomic medicine. We will take advantage of the opportunities listed
above. Once this project is completed, the first expert network for rare diseases will be
effective in a Sub-Saharan African country and Congolese patients will have been
diagnosed. The first mobile App and electronic registry of African rare disease patients will
be implemented in a Sub-Saharan African country. The feasibility of analysis of genomic data
from Africa in the Cloud will be demonstrated at a broader scale. Our collaborations with the
UDNI, the ClinGen, the FDNA, the Baylor College of Medicine, and the Broad Institute will
offer assurance of the quality of data generated in this project. On the scientific front, the
epidemiology and underlying genetics of rare diseases in Africa will be revealed. We will use
the publications, ClinVar, DECIPHER and the Atlas of Human Malformation Syndromes in
diverse populations to contribute to the global genomic medicine community. The registry
will allow more disease-specific research to be conducted.
The model developed in this project is expected to be taken up by the government and be
replicated in countries with similar challenges."

Excessive perivascular fibrosis results from the highly dynamic and dysregulated process of normal tissue repair
and is defined by the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) material resulting in decreased
vascular compliance and increased vessel stiffness. In contrast, a fibrotic response is critical to the formation
and stability of a fibrous cap in the setting of atherosclerosis. While advances have been made in our
understanding of fibrosis pathobiology, significant gaps remain. In particular, while mesenchymal cells with the
potential to transition into activated myofibroblasts are believed to be key sources of excessive ECM deposition,
their origin remain debated. Using cell-specific lineage tracing and RNA sequencing, our group made the
paradigm-shifting discovery that a subpopulation of resident vascular stem cells residing within the vascular
adventitia originate from mature vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC)(termed AdvSca1-SM cells). SMC
reprogramming and AdvSca1-SM cell maintenance is dependent on induction and activity of the transcription
factor, Klf4. In contrast, vascular injury-induced or AdvSca1-SM cell-specific genetic Klf4 depletion promote the
transition to profibrotic myofibroblasts, which consequently serve as major contributors to perivascular fibrosis.
However, the molecular mechanism whereby Klf4 dictates the maintenance and differentiation of AdvSca1-SM
cells remains unclear. Leveraging a highly specific AdvSca1-SM cell reporter system and single-cell RNA-
sequencing (scRNA-seq), we demonstrate the profibrotic differentiation trajectory of AdvSca1-SM cells.
Differentiation is characterized by loss of Klf4 and its downstream effector PI16, a negative regulator of the
epigenetic protein, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and the lncRNA, Meg3, but gain of expression of a profibrotic
phenotype. Importantly, these changes were recapitulated in human fibrotic tissue, underlying the translational
significance. Statin treatment was previously shown to reduce tissue fibrosis; however, the molecular mechanism
is unknown. Querying Connectivity Map database with gene signatures of AdvSca1-SM cells and their profibrotic
derivatives indicate that statins are potential candidates to antagonize the profibrotic transition of AdvSca1-SM
cells. Finally, while inflammation and fibrosis drive the wound healing process in most adult mammals, scarless
regenerative wound healing in adult rodents of the species Acomys has been reported. Our recent findings show
a complete absence of fibrosis with rapid regeneration in two models of kidney injury in Acomys. Here, we
propose a novel concept that a Klf4-Meg3 axis plays a central role in the maintenance of the stem cell phenotype;
loss of Klf4 and/or Meg3 activates a signaling cascade facilitating the phenotypic transition of AdvSca1-SM (Aim
One). Further, we propose that Acomys is resistant to pathological vascular remodeling and fibrosis in part due
to activation of an AdvSca1-SM-specific regenerative gene expression signature (Aim Two). Finally, statin
treatment will inhibit or reverse the profibrotic transition of AdvSca1-SM cells (Aim Three)."
10908429,"Clostridioides difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial infections in the United States and costs
the healthcare system an estimated $5 billion/yr. C. difficile infections are costly and difficult to treat
because they recur at high frequency (~20%). Disease recurrence depends on C. difficile’s ability to form
metabolically dormant spores because they are the transmissive form of this obligate anaerobe. Recent
studies in mice have shown that preventing spore formation can break the damaging cycle of recurrent
infection that characterizes C. difficile disease. While blocking spore formation with cephamycins can
prevent recurrence in mice when combined with vancomycin, the current standard-of-care, cephamycins
can sensitize humans to C. difficile infections by exacerbating gut dysbiosis. Thus, anti-sporulation
therapies that selectively target C. difficile are needed. Developing such therapies, however, will require
a deeper understanding of how C. difficile assembles a spore.
 Cephamycins block spore formation by inhibiting SpoVD, a sporulation-induced penicillin-binding
protein. In Bacillus subtilis, SpoVD works in concert with the SpoVE glycosyltransferase and SpoVB
flippase to synthesize a thick, protective layer of spore peptidoglycan (PG) known as the cortex. While
we confirmed that C. difficile cortex synthesis requires these three factors, we unexpectedly found that C.
difficile SpoVD and SpoVE regulate the earliest stage of spore formation, asymmetric division. We also
identified sporulation-induced, divisome-like proteins that regulate asymmetric division. These results
strongly suggest that C. difficile uses a unique sporulation-induced PG synthesis machine to synthesize
polar septa; this machinery could be selectively targeted to prevent spore formation.
 Our data further suggest that C. difficile uses a distinct PG synthesis machinery to synthesize
medial septa during vegetative cell division because the divisome components we have identified are
dispensable in C. difficile, despite being essential in all other bacteria studied to date. Interestingly,
sporulation-induced SpoVD may modulate vegetative cell division because loss of SpoVD sensitizes C.
difficile to cephamycin antibiotics during broth culture. Based on these findings, this proposal seeks to
determine how C. difficile regulates polar septum formation during sporulation and how it uses some of
these components to enhance C. difficile’s resistance to cell wall antibiotics during vegetative growth.
Completing these aims will define an important new mechanism by which C. difficile assembles
infectious spores, lay the foundation for developing C. difficile-specific anti-sporulation therapies, and
reveal novel mechanisms that contribute to C. difficile’s high level of resistance to cell wall antibiotics."
10913423,"ABSTRACT
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the adult mammalian bone marrow (BM) are rare multipotent cells that
can regenerate and sustain multilineage hematopoiesis upon transplantation. Given the rarity and limited
availability of HSC in the BM, strategies to ""mobilize"" HSC from the BM to the peripheral blood show great
promise to enhance the efficiency of hematopoietic reconstitution. On the other hand, the reconstitution
capacity of HSC can be impaired in old age or following inflammatory insults. HSC are localized in a unique
functional BM compartment called the niche. Its key component is a network of perivascular stromal cells
expressing the HSC growth factor stem cell factor (SCF or Kit ligand) and chemokine CXCL12, whose
receptor CXCR4 helps retain HSC in the BM. However, the morphology and dynamics of endogenous live
HSC and their interactions with the BM niche components have not been well characterized. We have
developed a system for specific fluorescent labeling of adult murine HSC, and adapted it for intravital
imaging of HSC within the BM. Preliminary studies revealed an unexpectedly dynamic morphology and
complex motility of HSC in the steady state. Furthermore, we were able to visualize interactions between
live HSC and the stromal cells. We will apply this system to systematically study the behavior of live HSC
and their interaction with the niche in live animals. The project involves a collaboration between labs with
the expertise in genetic manipulation and analysis of HSC (Reizis), intravital microscopy of the BM
(Fooksman) and computational analysis and modeling of cell behavior (Krichevsky). In Aim 1, we will
visualize the behavior of live HSC in the BM in the steady state and during inflammation. In Aim 2, we will
characterize the interaction of HSC with their BM environment, both in normal conditions and after
mobilization from the BM. In Aim 3, we will analyze the molecular basis of HSC dynamics and correlate it
with HSC function in supporting hematopoiesis. The proposed studies would address major gaps in our
knowledge of basic HSC biology, and provide novel insights into the clinically relevant process of HSC
mobilization."
10890005,"The goals of this R01 Renewal are driven by the results of our successfully conducted randomized
controlled clinical trial comparing endoscopic third ventriculostomy combined with choroid plexus
cauterization (ETV/CPC) to shunt treatment for post-infectious hydrocephalus (PIH, the most common
hydrocephalus etiology in Uganda) in infants < 6 months of age (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01936272,
R01HD085853, R21HD068213) at the CURE Children’s Hospital of Uganda (CCHU). The interim
outcomes of this study are becoming a landmark in children’s medicine, finding that: a) at up to 24
months, there was no significant difference between ETV/CPC and shunt in regard to failure rate,
developmental outcome, and brain growth; b) brain volume, not CSF volume, correlated strongly with
developmental outcome; c) successful treatment of the hydrocephalus led to improved brain growth in
the first year, which stagnated during the second year. Because almost all of the failures of endoscopic
treatment occurred early in the first year of life, we anticipate that the longer term outcomes of
hydrocephalus treatment may favor endoscopy if we follow these children through primary school age
from 5 to 10 years. Furthermore, our ability to perform much more detailed neurocognitive assessments
during this further followup will be much more accurate than during our pre-school assessments. Lastly,
we can gather all of our data and perform a much more definitive cost-effectiveness analysis if we can
follow this unique cohort for a full 10 years.
 We have engaged in substantial capacity building during the previous 5 years of support during this
clinical trial. We have developed a thriving research unit at the CURE Children’s Hospital of Uganda,
enabling high-quality research to be conducted in multiple other NIH funded studies unrelated to this
clinical trial (DP1HD086071, R01AI145057, and R01HD096693). Furthermore, since all hydrocephalus
treatment requires brain imaging, we have developed a thriving center for sustainable low-field MRI
engineering at the Mbarara University of Science and Technology.
 This present project seeks to follow this unique cohort to 10 years of age, seeking to definitively
establish whether endoscopic treatment is more sustainable for infants in the developing world, establish
low field MRI as a sustainable imaging technology, and establish the capacity of both the medical and
engineering sites in Uganda as independent research and technology development centers for Africa."

 Trichomonas vaginalis is the causative agent of trichomoniasis, the most common, non-viral sexually-
transmitted disease, with 5-7 million cases in the U.S. and >200 million in the world each year. In addition to
infections of the urogenital tract, trichomoniasis increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, HIV
transmission, and cervical and prostate cancer. Only two drugs of the same class are FDA-approved for
treatment, the nitro drugs metronidazole and tinidazole. Although generally effective, treatment failures occur in
a substantial fraction of patients and the drugs have significant liabilities, with moderate to severe adverse
effects and poor compliance due to seemingly benign but common side effects such as metallic taste. Given its
prevalence, its association with multiple disease outcomes, and an increase in nitro drug-resistant strains, new
antimicrobials against T. vaginalis are urgently needed, particularly in women where infection can persist for
months or even years compared to generally less than ten days in men. In extensive preliminary studies, we
determined that inhibitors of the proteasome, an essential cellular machinery for the degradation and recycling
of cell proteins, kill T. vaginalis at sub-micromolar levels. Importantly, the inhibitors overcome nitro drug
resistance and are efficacious in a murine model of trichomonad infection. We have also isolated and
biochemically characterized proteasomes from T. vaginalis and human HeLa cells and found that they display
significant differences in their peptide substrate specificity, providing the rationale for designing new potent and
parasite-selective proteasome inhibitors. Based on these promising findings, the project has the overall
objective to develop novel proteasome inhibitors with greatly improved potency and selectivity for the treatment
of trichomoniasis. Using a hit compound with 50-fold selectivity, we will systematically develop T. vaginalis-
specific proteasome inhibitors using a comprehensive combination of medicinal chemistry efforts, functional
testing with multiple clinical strains of T. vaginalis, biochemical and structural investigations of the parasite
proteasomes, and efficacy and toxicity testing in murine infection models. We have assembled a superb team
of investigators with complementary expertise in parasitology, protease biology, antimicrobial drug
development, and medicinal and peptide chemistry. The team has the experience and track record to conduct
the critical pre-clinical studies to establish proteasome inhibitors as a new class of agents in the therapeutic
armamentarium against trichomoniasis."

10914011,"ABSTRACT
Drug delivery to the brain is restrained by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a physical and biochemical barrier
separating the brain from the circulatory system. Small molecule drugs move across the BBB mainly via
transcellular passive diffusion and transporter-mediated active transport. The BBB in brain tumors is disrupted
to varying extent, leading to large intra- and inter-individual variability in drug tumor exposure. Mechanistic
understanding and prediction of heterogeneous drug penetration across the intact BBB and disrupted blood-
brain tumor barrier (BBTB) is of paramount importance to rational drug development and treatment for brain
cancer. Given the fact that the rate and extent of drug penetration across the BBB is determined by both
biological system characteristics and drug properties, prediction of human BBB/BBTB permeability from
preclinical in vitro or animal models is complicated by biological system differences. Hence, the development of
innovative approaches is imperative. The in vitro-in vivo extrapolation-physiologically based pharmacokinetic
(IVIVE-PBPK) model offers a unique platform that allows simultaneous incorporation of drug- and system-
specific parameters into a PK model and enables a priori prediction of individual in vivo kinetic processes based
on mechanistic scaling of in vitro data (e.g., in vitro enzyme and transporter kinetics). The overall goal of this
project is to develop a mechanism-based PBPK model platform for predicting heterogeneous drug penetration
into the human brain and brain tumors. We will employ an integrated translational research approach to achieve
this goal, which leverages in vitro pharmacology studies, PK modeling, and clinical trials. Three drugs (AZD1775,
ceritinib, and ribociclib) will be used for initial model development and verification, and additional 3 drugs
(everolimus, abemaciclib, and LY3214996) will be used for further model validation. These drugs have been or
is being evaluated in glioblastoma patients in our clinical trial program. Observed clinical plasma and brain tumor
PK data are available for model development and validation. As the first step towards resolving the gap of our
knowledge on BBB transporter abundances, which is essential to establishing IVIVE scaling factors for predicting
transporter-mediated active clearance at the human BBB and BBTB, Aim 1 is to determine transporter protein
abundances in isolated microvessels of non-cancerous cortex as well as contrast-enhancing and non-enhancing
glioblastoma specimens. Aim 2 is to determine drug-specific parameters for metabolism, passive transcellular
permeability, and interaction with efflux and uptake drug transporters. Aim 3 is to develop and validate a novel
7-compartment permeability-limited brain (7Brain) PBPK model, which accounts for brain and tumor regional
physiological differences in blood perfusion, pH, BBB/BBTB integrity, and transporter expression. The 7Brain
PBPK model is the first-of-its kind, mechanism-based model platform for the prediction of heterogeneous drug
penetration across the human BBB and BBTB. It promises to be a valuable tool to assist the development and
design of improved drugs and dosing regimens for more effective treatment of brain cancer."
10910057,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Myocardial infarction (MI) predisposes patients to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) and sudden
cardiac death. After MI, alterations within the cardiac sympathetic nervous system (SNS) have been tightly
linked to VT/VF. These alterations include inflammation, structural and functional remodeling within the stellate
ganglion, and heterogeneous remodeling of intramyocardial sympathetic nerves in the scar-border zone.
These result in enhanced and dysfunctional cardiac sympathetic neurotransmission that lead to VT/VF.
Although spinal afferent signaling is enhanced after MI, the arrhythmogenic potential of spinal afferents (via
maladaptive interactions with cardiac sympathetic nerves) has not been explored. Based on novel data from
our group, the goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that chronic enhanced cardiac afferent signaling is
the primary driver of sympathetic neural remodeling and dysfunction that causes VT/VF.
 Pilot studies from our group using epicardial resiniferatoxin (RTX) to deplete cardiac TRPV1 afferents in
porcine support the rationale that persistent afferent signaling (beyond the acute ischemic phase) plays a
central role in shaping the neural and cardiac substrates that lead to VAs. We will test our hypotheses using
novel tools from a multidisciplinary team of investigators in 3 aims, in porcine with MI. In aim 1, we will
determine whether post-MI structural, neuroinflammatory, and functional neuronal remodeling within stellate
ganglia are caused by persistent TRPV1 afferent signaling. In aim 2, we will determine whether persistent
cardiac TRPV1 activation amplifies intramyocardial neurotransmitter release to increase VT/VF risk. This will
be accomplished using simultaneous cardiac electrophysiologic mapping and real time in vivo detection of
intramyocardial Norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y levels. We will determine whether TRPV1 afferent
depletion attenuates arrhythmogenicity by normalizing neurotransmitter release patterns. In aim 3, we will
define the optimal site of RTX delivery for clinical management of VT/VF [Epicardial vs. Stellate Ganglion vs.
Epidural application]. This will guide clinical translation of afferent neuromodulation. The results of this proposal
may shift how arrhythmogenesis is approached after MI, and guide the development of new therapies that
prevent altered afferent signaling after MI to fill a major clinical gap."
10902115,"Project Summary
Immune activation is a hallmark of myocardial infarction (MI) and dictate infarct healing and left ventricular (LV)
remodeling. It is established, both in preclinical and clinical studies, that immediately after infarction immune
cells from the spleen and the bone-marrow (BM) egress into the systemic circulation and traffic to the ischemic
hearts. This suggests that the damage signals from the injured hearts are communicated to the lymphoid and
the hematopoietic tissues to initiate cardiac-specific immune responses. However, the mechanisms by which
these signals are transferred to the immune-rich niches such as the spleen are not known.
 Recent studies have shown that exosomes, membranous vesicles of 30-100 nm size, are potent
intercellular communication vehicles that can shuttle mRNA, miRNA, and proteins to the distant tissues for
physiological and pathological immune activation. It is also known that circulating exosomal levels increase
during myocyte damage and contain sarcomeric, cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins in their cargo. Despite
this understanding, it is not known if exosomes also serve as the antigenic vehicles to carry damage-
associated protein signals from the ischemic myocardium to the spleen for subsequent immune activation.
Indeed, our preliminary results clearly show that intravenous administration of exosomes released by the
ischemic hearts (as compared to sham) into the naïve mice induce i) systolic dysfunction (increased end-
diastolic and end-systolic volumes and decreased ejection fraction), ii) gene expression of damage associated
signals (S100A8, S100A9 and eotaxin) in the left-ventricles, iii) splenic remodeling, and iv) infiltration of innate
and adaptive immune cells in the myocardium. Moreover, MI exosomes expressed tumor necrosis factor
receptor-1 (TNFR1; and not TNFR2) on their membranes, a classical pro-inflammatory signaling molecule that
have been shown to correlate with HF severity and cardiac dysfunction clinically. Importantly, intravenous
injection of exosomes isolated from 1d MI TNFR1-/- mice failed to induce cardiac dysfunction in naïve mice
suggesting a potent, and previously unknown, role of exosomal TNFR1 in mediating immune activation post-MI
and cardiac dysfunction. Therefore, this led us to hypothesize that exosomes carry cardiac antigens to mediate
splenic immune cell activation during MI, are critical for immune cell mediated pathological LV remodeling, and
these effects are dependent upon the exosomal TNFR1 expression. Importantly, these are key cellular targets
for immunomodulation. We will test this hypothesis by i) determining the pathophysiological role of the spleen
in mediating exosomal processing post-MI, ii) defining the source and role of vesicular TNFR1 in exosome
mediated cardiac dysfunction, and iii) determining the role of exosomal TNFR1 in mediating immunogenic
signaling."

DNA repair plays an important role in the pathogenesis of virtually all cancer types, and the identification of
aberrant DNA repair pathways has identified predictive and prognostic biomarkers to targeted therapies. For
example, epigenetic hypermethylation of the promoter of O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)
predicts for better patient survival and increased sensitivity to temozolomide (TMZ) in multiple cancers,
including colorectal cancer (CRC). TMZ is a monofunctional alkylator, and the DNA damage caused by TMZ is
principally repaired by MGMT, which is silenced by promoter hypermethylation. The base excision repair (BER)
pathway also serves as a critical pathway to repair TMZ DNA damage. Preclinically, the simultaneous inhibition
of BER with polyp ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors further sensitizes MGMT deficient tumors to TMZ.
However, our preliminary findings reveal an alternative and parallel mechanism: TMZ damage causes acute
replication stress and fork collapse leading to Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) dependent
phosphorylation of Checkpoint Kinase 1 (Chk1). We have leveraged these findings, and additional in vivo
experiments, to advance novel TMZ combinations into the clinic with two investigator-initiated clinical trials for
MGMT silenced CRC: 1) TMZ + olaparib (PARP inhibitor) and TMZ + AZD 6738 (ATR inhibitor). Enrollment will
proceed at Yale Smilow Cancer Hospital with future opportunities expand to collaborating sites through our
CRC Stand up to Cancer (SU2C) Dream Team. Furthermore, we aim to develop new biomarker assays
including a biomarker assessing MGMT heterogeneity to identify tumors most sensitive to TMZ combinations,
and perform genomic profiling. Leveraging DNA damage additionally represents a potential tool to stimulate an
immune response, and through ancillary studies and using specimens obtained from our trials we will study the
effects TMZ combinations on the immune microenvironment to lend support to the addition of immunotherapy
in the future. I am a medical oncologist focusing on the treatment of advanced gastrointestinal (GI) cancers
with an emphasis on innovative therapies for CRC. This award will facilitate my development as a physician-
scientist equipped to design and conduct investigator-initiated early phase clinical trials based on innovative
preclinical evidence regarding DNA repair and immunotherapies. My training will include didactic coursework
for tumor immunology, practical experience of clinical trial implementation, and formal instruction in biomarker
techniques. To achieve these goals, I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentorship team led by my primary
mentor, Dr. Patricia LoRusso who has a proven track record of successfully mentoring junior faculty and
extensive expertise in investigator-initiated clinical trials. At the conclusion of this award, I will have gained
valuable skills into the underpinnings of clinical research generically, and specifically for clinical trial design,
and biomarker identification for DNA repair and immunology. This award will help establish me as an
independent investigator conducting early phase clinical trials for CRC and other GI cancers."

The ability to vicariously experience the other's aversive feelings in a situation, a process called observational
fear (OF), is critical to live in society. Malfunctions of OF represent well-described findings in individuals with
autism spectrum disorders. In OF, an observer witnesses a demonstrator in an aversive situation and
responds with fear behaviors. If the demonstrator's reaction is robust, the observer easily expresses OF
without prior similar experience and social familiarity with demonstrator (we refer to as innate OF). However,
in nature and our lives, the demonstrator's reaction is often ambiguous and thus difficult for the observer to
understand. To fully understand the other's situation, the observer utilizes both prior similar own experience
and social familiarity that facilitate OF (we refer to as experience-dependent OF; Exp OF). While innate OF
primarily depends on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), the neural
mechanisms of Exp OF remain unexplored. My goal is to elucidate the neural mechanisms of how both prior
similar own experience and social familiarity enable the observer to fully understand the other's aversive
situation from their ambiguous reaction, by examining hippocampal (HPC)-BLA neural circuits in a mouse OF
model that delivers strong electrical shocks to the demonstrator eliciting a robust reaction or weak electrical
shocks eliciting an ambiguous reaction.
 Recently, our preliminary studies showed that ACC is dispensable for Exp OF, while ACC is essential
for innate OF. On the other hand, both dorsal HPC (dHPC) and ventral HPC (vHPC) are crucial for Exp OF,
but not for innate OF. BLA is required for both Exp and innate OF. These findings lead us to propose distinct
neural circuits in Exp and innate OF. The central hypothesis of this model is that the dorsoventral HPC to BLA
pathways generate and reactivate a neural ensemble of BLA neurons encoding prior similar own fear
Guided by strong
preliminary data, first, we propose that the dorsoventral HPC to BLA pathways are crucial for Exp OF, while
the ACC to BLA pathway is essential for innate OF. Second, we propose that the reactivation of a neural
ensemble of BLA neurons encoding prior similar own fear experience (a fear memory ensemble) mediates
Exp OF as the perception-action mechanisms. Third, we propose that the pathway from dHPC to BLA
generates the fear memory ensemble in BLA during own fear experience and then vHPC neurons respond to
the familiar demonstrator's fearful situation to reactivate the fear memory ensemble in BLA to elicit Exp OF.
experience, which facilitates Exp OF, while ACC induces robust BLA activity for innate OF.
 Collectively, our proposed research will broadly impact the field of learning and memory by
characterizing neural circuits and their neural process about how we understand the other's aversive
situational experience. Potentially, the neural mechanisms can be generalized for other types of empathy to
vicariously experience the other's feeling/situation."

Life-long education and learning in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) is necessary for society
at large to adapt to a 21st century world and beyond. This is especially true at the high school level, where
students begin to translate the imagination, discovery, and curiosity of middle school science to higher-level
science and analysis, which will then advance further when university studies begin. Enhancing STEM literacy
requires that science, technology, engineering, and math training be accessible and engaging to high school
studies, well before university studies even begin. Faculty in the College of Pharmacy at the University of Rhode
Island train upper-division undergraduate students in course-based undergraduate research experiences or
CUREs in medicinal chemistry. Course participants become more than just learners; they become motivated
researchers involved in a genuine scientific effort designed to enable future biomedical discoveries. One
deliverable that students create during their medicinal chemistry course is a plant extract library from specimens
in the Heber W. Youngken Jr. Medicinal Garden. This library is named PRISM - the Principal Rhode Island
Secondary Metabolite library. We propose to extend the concept of a medicinal chemistry CURE and authentic
research experiences to the high school level (9-12 grades) by developing HERBAL: Hands-on Education and
Research for Biomedical and Analytical Learning. HERBAL will pair research in the laboratory with game-based
online classroom modules to teach theory and methods of medicinal plant and herbal product analysis during
the academic year. Summer sessions will allow students in the HERBAL program to analyze samples they
themselves have generated on cutting-edge instrumentation available in the University of Rhode Island’s
teaching laboratories. Additionally, we will focus on the beneficial wellness aspects of herbals and their integrated
role in our biomedicine along with artistic and creative opportunities connecting medicinal plant research to
drawing and illustration. The HERBAL program will consist of 1) teacher training workshops to educate
instructors on how to deliver the HERBAL academic year program. 2) Teacher training will be followed by an
academic laboratory course for students with game-based learning modules to train students in theory and
application. 3) Following completion of the academic year, students will attend a summer course in
chromatography, mass spectrometry, and informatics analysis. This summer course will be complemented with
mentorship, career enhancement activities, guest speakers on herbal medicine, and artistic and wellness events.
HERBAL’s focus on curricular and method development activities augmented with interactive digital-media
based learning modules will shift the paradigm in how these students traditionally learn science, which will
increase student interest in STEM topics and enhance their STEM identity."

Millions of Ukrainians (both civilian and military) had been recently exposed to combat/war-related
trauma. The numbers of casualties are staggering. Based on UN data, even during the early, and
limited, conflict in Ukraine (2014-2021), it had been estimated that, 32% of individuals suffered from
PTSD, 22% Depression, and 17% anxiety, thus it is projected that hundreds of thousands of persons
are likely to develop debilitating trauma/stress-related mental health sequela. At the same time, the
situation with mental health care in Ukraine is critical. The country was under communist rule for 70
years, leading to chronic underfunding of health care in general and mental health in particular. Even
before Russian invasion, Ukraine had the highest levels of psychological distress among former Soviet
states, and there almost no mental health professionals trained in evidence-based care for trauma,
depression, anxiety, and even less so, investigators who can disseminate, implement, and assess the
fidelity, acceptability, and efficacy of these treatments. Thus building, trauma care research, and

experts in research methodology, stress/trauma and evidence-based care, this project will implement a
set of trauma research training experiences. The goal is to transfer of knowledge pertaining to trauma
epidemiology, pathophysiology, research methods, and implementation of interventions that build upon
that scientific base. In the latter years of the program, we will mentor and collaborate in the design and
pilot testing of research projects that ultimately will have the potential for national dissemination. The
proposed program involves collaboration among faculty from 5 different US Universities (TAMU,
UThealth, University of Michigan, Emory and MUSC), National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy
(NaUKMA), and Zelenskaya Initiative office for Mental Health reform implementation. To implement a
set of interlocking training experiences which will include the following: (a) Yearly workshops (~ 70
attendees) held in Western Ukraine, for post-doctoral clinical scientists (b) ongoing continuous
education with Experts from US and Ukraine, including monthly online sessions, directed reading and
supervision (c) Three month-long intensive Summer School, for 16 advanced and committed Summer
Fellows to get in-depth training in research methodology and work with mentors in areas of common
interest, (d) In-country research projects that Summer Fellows will develop, with the support of long
term U.S. mentors, (e) Creation of a Research network comprised from Research teams led by

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in elderly population, and is the seventh
leading cause of death in the US. Despite decades of efforts in understanding AD biology and in developing
therapies, effective strategies to cure AD or to alleviate AD symptoms remain limited. AD poses a significant
medical and socioeconomical burden to the world that requires urgent solutions to understand the basis of its
pathogenesis and to develop effective means to prevent cognitive deterioration, or to improve patient lives.
GWAS studies identified many risk genetic variants in the noncoding genome regions, particularly in
enhancers, suggesting key roles of enhancer malfunction and gene deregulation in AD pathogenesis.
Epigenetic studies of human AD brains also revealed significant changes such as histone acetylation at
enhancers. Better knowledge of gene deregulation and enhancer malfunction is critical to better understand
AD pathology and to identify new therapeutic targets. The recent findings that active enhancers often generate
noncoding enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) have provided a new perspective to interpret enhancer malfunction in AD.
This proposal aims to explore a unique direction by characterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying eRNA
functions in brain and AD. Our overall hypothesis is that enhancers were aberrantly active in AD, resulting in
deregulated eRNAs to assemble ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) to organize a nuclear RNA compartment
that can impact gene expression networks in brain cells. We have assembled a strong investigator team to test
this hypothesis with three specific aims. First, we plan to identify deregulated eRNAs from both human
samples and iPSC derived neuron and microglia cells, and identify functions of specific eRNAs in AD
associated gene regulation. Second, we will study mechanisms of eRNAs' functions in depth, by using a robust
RNA capture method that we have developed to systematically identify neuronal and microglia eRNA:protein
interactomes. We will examine the mechanisms of eRNA-binding proteins (eRBPs) in regulating AD associated
enhancer and gene transcription, and in impacting the three-dimensional genome architecture. Third, based on
our recent findings of a critical role of RNA m6A methylation on eRNAs in enhancer activation and signal
induced gene transcription, we will examine eRNA methylome in human brain samples and iPSC derived
neuron/microglia in response to AD-associated signaling. This aim will uncover new knowledge to understand
how chemical modifications of chromatin associated RNAs may mechanistically impact gene transcription to
contribute to AD. Together, the expected results from this proposal will not only provide mechanistic insights
into brain gene regulation and noncoding RNA functions in AD, but also can offer new therapeutic targets and
strategies to intervene this devastating disease."

Ghana is one of the countries with the greatest Plasmodium falciparum malaria burden, with case trends
increasing in recent years. There is a critical gap in research and programmatic efforts to understand
malaria epidemiology in urban settings in high-burden countries. The overall research goal of this project is
to generate the evidence base to determine strategies to effectively monitor and target interventions
appropriate for urban environments in Accra, Ghana, a typical African city in a high-burden country.
Through paired clinical incidence data and three household-based cross-sectional surveys in 13 health
facility catchment areas, we will: 1) characterize the malaria epidemiology across a transmission season
using reported clinical incidence and household-based surveys; 2) Quantify the degree of bias in routine
surveillance data due to non-care-seeking malaria infections in an urban setting; 3) Assess the ability of
routine malaria surveillance data to identify fine-scale spatial heterogeneity of malaria infections; and 4)
determine the degree of infections clustering in households to justify whether targeted strategies are
appropriate for the urban setting. The results of this study will fill a critical gap in understanding urban
malaria epidemiology and promote data-driven decision-making to ensure malaria control strategies are
appropriate and can adapt to the local context."

People are remarkably adept at making sense of the world through sound: understanding speech in a noisy
restaurant, picking out the voice of a family member, or recognizing a familiar melody. Although we take these
abilities for granted, they reflect impressive computational feats of biological engineering that are remarkably
difficult to replicate in machine systems. The long-term goal of my research program is to develop computational
and experimental methods to reverse-engineer how the brain codes natural sounds like speech and to exploit
these advances to understand and aid in the treatment of hearing impairment. One of the central challenges of
coding natural sounds is that they are structured at many different timescales from milliseconds to seconds and
even minutes. How does the brain integrate across these diverse timescales to derive meaning from sound?
Answering this question has been challenging because there are no general-purpose methods for measuring
neural timescales in the brain. As a consequence, we know relatively little about how neural timescales are
organized in auditory cortex and how this organization enables the coding of natural sounds. To overcome these
limitations, we develop a simple experimental paradigm (the “temporal context invariance” or TCI paradigm) for
estimating the temporal integration period of any sensory response: the time window during which stimuli alter
the response. We apply the TCI method to human electrocorticography (ECoG) and animal physiology
recordings to reveal the organization of neural timescales at both the region and single-cell level (Aim I). Pilot
data from our analyses reveal that timescales are organized hierarchically, with higher-order regions showing
substantially longer integration periods. To explore the functional significance of this timescale hierarchy, we
couple TCI with computational techniques well-suited for characterizing natural sounds (Aim II). We test whether
increased integration periods enable a more noise-robust representation of speech (Aim IIA), whether regions
with longer integration periods code higher-order properties of natural sounds (Aim IIB&IIC), whether there are
dedicated integration periods for important sounds categories like speech or music (Aim IID), and whether
cortical integration periods can be explained by the duration of the features they respond to (Aim IIE). In the
process of conducting this research, I will be trained in two critical areas: (1) ECoG, which is the only method
with the spatial and temporal precision to understand how neural timescales are organized in the human brain
(2) deep neural networks (DNN) which are the only models able to perform challenging perceptual tasks at
human levels and predict neural responses in higher-order cortical regions. After completing this training, I will
have a unique set of experimental (fMRI, ECoG, psychophysics) and computational skills (data-driven statistical
modeling and hypothesis-driven DNN modeling), which will facilitate my transition to an independent investigator."
10800763,"How the precise patterns are achieved during development of the human body plan remains obscure due to
limited access to human embryos, while elucidating the mechanisms will advance knowledge of human
development and contribute to regenerative medicine. The goal of my research is to reconstruct development of
the human body axis and appendages using pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and to illuminate general principles of
pattern formation. I have used iPSC to successfully establish two 3D models recapitulating spatiotemporal
features of human somite formation, which provide a valuable platform to decode mechanisms of body axis
patterning with unprecedented resolution. Using these models, I found that active cell sorting underlies the
antero-posterior (AP) polarity patterning of somites and put forward a novel framework explaining the formation
of repeated structures along the body axis. In this proposal I will further utilize the in vitro models to expand and
refine the cell sorting centered framework of somite AP patterning, as well as develop 3D models of human limb
development to set up foundation for my future investigation of digit periodic patterning.
 In Aim1, I will investigate how cell sorting are coordinated with classical modules of somitogenesis. In the
mentored phase, I will uncover roles of the segmentation clock in synchronizing the onset of cell sorting within a
forming segment to ensure robust tissue-level patterning. In the independent phase, I will interrogate how somite
size control is coordinated with AP pattern formation. Together these will bridge the novel finding of cell sorting
with established concepts of somitogenesis. In Aim2, I will elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms of
cell sorting and shine light on general cell biological principles of pattern formation. In parallel, I will set out to
develop organoid models of human limb development using iPSCs. In Aim3, I will combine a preliminary 2D
differentiation protocol of Limb bud cells in the Pourquie lab, the expertise in maintaining limb progenitors in vitro
of the Tabin lab, and my specialty in 3D organoid culture to build 3D models recapitulating features of limb bud
elongation and patterning.
 The proposed work will strengthen my knowledge of body axis development, equip me with expertise in
limb development, and establish groundwork for my future career in elucidating periodic pattern formation during
human development. Altogether, this proposal will provide valuable insights into the early development of human
body plan and guide complex organ engineering to further dissect mechanisms and treat diseases."

Candidate: Dr. Kathleen Walsh is an Internal Medicine-trained physician scientist who has spent the past
seven years conducting research in Haiti. She has gained first-hand experience in treating drug-resistant TB,
learned Haitian Kreyol and trained a research team of Haitian physicians, nurses and lab technicians in the
conduct of research in tuberculosis. She has authored 22 publications including 9 first author papers. She has
preliminary data suggesting there is an emerging epidemic of isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis (INHr-TB), that
adolescents are a sentinel population for INHr-TB in Haiti and that INHr-TB is predominantly being transmitted
outside the household in community settings. She seeks to investigate the epidemiology of INHr-TB in Haiti.
Career Goals: Dr. Walsh's goals are:
 1. To gain skills in molecular epidemiology through utilization of whole genome sequencing to identify
 molecular disease clustering and INHr-TB transmission.
 2. To gain expertise in geographic information systems (GIS) mapping of INHr- and DS-TB in Haiti
 3. To acquire skills in biostatistics, specifically analysis of temporal trends and Poisson regression
Career Development Plan: Dr. Walsh will have mentorship from Dr. Daniel Fitzgerald (clinical TB
epidemiology), Dr. Jean W. Pape (TB disease mapping), Dr. Theodore Cohen (molecular epidemiology), Dr.
Denis Nash (spatial epidemiology) and Dr. Myung Hee Lee (biostatistics). She will engage in courses and field
work related to her proposed research. She will submit an R01 application based on this data.
Environment: The proposed research will occur at Weill Cornell Medicine (New York, USA) and GHESKIO
(Port-au-Prince, Haiti), which has 40 years of NIH-supported research and training in TB.
Research: INHr-TB is the most common form of drug-resistant TB worldwide. Strains of Mtb typically acquire
resistance to INH first and then sequentially to other drugs. Therefore, INH resistance is a precursor to
multidrug-resistant TB. Since INH resistance is rarely diagnosed, there are large gaps in our understanding of
this disease. Dr. Walsh hypothesizes that INHr-TB is an emerging epidemic in Haiti and adolescents are
sentinel populations for this emergence. She further postulates that INHr-TB is predominantly transmitted in
community settings and not in the household. She will test 5,183 diagnostic Mtb isolates from 2011 – 2021 to
characterize temporal trends in INHr-TB prevalence in Haiti and determine if INHr-TB trends in adolescents
precede INHr-TB trends in adults (Aim 1). She will prospectively investigate the conventional, molecular and
spatial epidemiology of 360 INHr-TB and 360 DS-TB patients in Haiti and identify congregate settings where
INHr-TB transmission is occurring (Aim 2). This project will provide critical insight into the epidemiology of
INHr-TB so that we can improve detection and prevention of INHr-TB in Haiti and worldwide."
10794377,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Regular physical activity plays an important role in disease prevention and helps people live longer, feel better,
and perform daily tasks more easily. Yet, less than 25% of American adults meet physical activity
recommendations, and Americans spend an average of 9.5 hours per day sedentary, putting them at increased
risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mortality. Black and rural adults are less likely to be physically
active and more likely to be sedentary than non-Hispanic White adults and those in urban areas, contributing to
racial and ethnic and rural health disparities. Interventions focused on increasing moderate-to-vigorous
physical activity have had limited success among Black adults residing in urban and rural areas. Reducing
sedentary behavior as a means to increase physical activity may be a more effective approach. Yoga is a
practice that combines the mind, body, and spirit through light-intensity movement, breath awareness, and
relaxation techniques, and can be a valuable tool to reduce sedentary behavior and promote movement in
adults who are insufficiently active and need to build up to regular physical activity. Furthermore, as a
mindfulness practice, yoga’s effects on stress may be particularly relevant to Black adults who experience
unique stressors, including racism and discrimination. Based on this, we partnered with churches to develop
and test the feasibility of Harmony & Health (HH), a theoretically based intervention that integrates yoga
practices with Christian spirituality to promote psychosocial wellbeing and movement among insufficiently
active Black adults. We first tested the feasibility of HH among Black adults residing in an urban city, and then
tested the feasibility of HH among a diverse sample of rural adults. This study is the next logical step and
expands on our pilot studies that confirmed the feasibility of HH in Black adults. Feasibility and acceptability
were high as measured by study completion (≥80% across studies), attendance (M urban=10.5±3.7; M
rural=10.6±4.2), and participant satisfaction (≥97.2% overall across sites). HH also improved psychosocial
wellbeing and reduced sitting time. The proposed study builds on these efforts by randomizing 100 Black
adults who are not meeting physical activity recommendations from two geographically distinct sites, one urban
and one more rural, to participate in HH or an attention control condition. HH sessions will take place twice a
week for 8 weeks and focus on sitting less and moving more using stretching, breathing, and guided relaxation
with Christian scripture. Assessments occur at baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 9), and follow up
(week 24). Results of this study will determine our ability to deliver these interventions with strong rigor and
fidelity across multiple sites and will establish the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention among urban
and rural Black adults. Findings from this study will be used to modify training and implementation procedures
in preparation for a future fully powered multi-site randomized controlled efficacy trial. If supported, HH could
be an innovative strategy to improve psychosocial wellbeing and physical activity in low active Black adults."

Insulin resistance (IR) in aging hearts of nondiabetics is known to be promoted by fat accumulation within
senescent myocardium in the absence of obesity or physical inactivity. Importantly, these changes make the
aged myocardium more susceptible to heart failure and sudden death. Similarly, aging of infarcted myocardium
in nondiabetic subjects is commonly accompanied by fat accumulation in myocardial scar tissue (lipomatous
metaplasia, LM). However, whether LM influences myocardial IR, remains unknown. Recent studies using a
nondiabetic rat model have demonstrated direct evidence of selective myocardial IR in chronic MIs with heart
failure. However, it remains unknown whether these MIs also had LM.
 Cardiac inflammaging post-MI is a state of chronic low-grade sterile inflammation that plays a key role in the
onset and progression of heart failure. It is a mast cell (MC)- and macrophage (MΦ)-driven process characterized
by a complex balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. Equally important, the preponderance of
MC and proinflammatory M1 MΦ within adipose tissue (AT) is now recognized as a hallmark of obesity-
associated low-grade inflammaging which leads to reduced expression of adipocyte glucose transporter (GLUT4)
and systemic IR. Systemic IR has been commonly observed in nondiabetic patients with ischemic post-MI
cardiomyopathy. However, whether these subjects also exhibit myocardial IR and/or LM, is unknown.
 Metabolic state and the phenotype of MC and MΦ throughout the inflammatory process are tightly linked.
While activated MC and M1 MΦ are highly dependent on glucose as an energy substrate, anti-inflammatory M2
MΦ are preferentially fueled by fatty acid β-oxidation. Lipid-overloading and insulin (hyper) stimulation have each
been demonstrated to promote MC activation, M1 polarization, and MΦ foam cell formation, thus initiating the
process of atherogenesis. Moreover, the pro-atherogenic effects of MCs were shown to be successfully
abolished via MC membrane stabilization. Notably, MC and lipid-laden M1 MΦ have each been demonstrated
in infarcted territory beyond subacute phase of MI. However, their long-term fate, the interaction between the
two, and their respective roles in LM and/or IR remain unknown.
 While 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) PET has emerged as a non-invasive imaging of choice to assess
myocardial immunometabolic state and to diagnose myocardium-specific IR, quantitative cardiac MR (qCMR) is
now widely accepted as the gold standard for the quantitative estimation of infarct size and tissue composition.
Herein, we propose to use a combined 18FDG-PET/qCMR imaging to evaluate the effects of MC stabilization on
metabolic phenotype and remodeling of MI, in a porcine model."

Loneliness is a psychological state arising from a discrepancy between perceived and desired social connection.
It is a significant risk factor for health concerns, including problematic alcohol use. Crucially, Latinx individuals in
the US experience greater loneliness than non-Latinx White individuals, and those who drink engage in more
problematic alcohol use. However, the initial precursors of loneliness and Latinx disparities in loneliness are not
well-understood. Moreover, it is unclear if loneliness is a cause of alcohol problems, a consequence of alcohol
problems, or a barrier to recovery. The objective of this application is to identify predictors of loneliness in Latinx
individuals and explain the link between loneliness and the development of problem drinking in this population.
We will evaluate a novel process model that explains loneliness and the development of alcohol problems in
Latinx individuals. The ALMA Process Model states that social contextual factors interact with Acculturative
Processes to predict Loneliness, Drinking Motives, and Alcohol Problems. The central hypothesis of this
research, guided by the ALMA Process Model, is that conflicts between Latinx individuals' cultural orientation
and the cultural orientation of those around them contribute to decreases in perceived social connection, leading
to loneliness. When feeling lonely, some people increase solitary drinking to cope with loneliness. Drinking to
avoid an aversive state will lead people to focus more on that state, exacerbating people's feelings of loneliness.
Over time, more solitary drinking will feed back into the experience of loneliness, leading to escalations in
problematic alcohol use. Three specific aims will provide structure for evaluating this model: (1) To identify short-
term predictors of loneliness and alcohol use in hazardous-drinking Latinx individuals; (2) To determine how
loneliness and hazardous drinking lead to the longitudinal development of alcohol problems in Latinx individuals;
and (3) To test the reciprocal influence of hazardous drinking and the development of alcohol problems on
loneliness trajectories over time in Latinx individuals. Aims will be accomplished using a longitudinal ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) “burst” design among 200 hazardous-drinking Latinx individuals from the
community. The EMA bursts will occur semi-annually at 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Data will be collected via
self-report, cognitive-behavioral task, wearable alcohol sensor, and geotagging. This project is expected to
contribute detailed conceptual information about the mechanisms, processes, and trajectories involved in social
connectedness and isolation. By evaluating the innovative ALMA process model, this research will provide a
formal explanation for Latinx disparities in loneliness and alcohol problems. Furthermore, this model is expected
to have broad impact because it is applicable to many health disparity populations (e.g., first-generation college
students, sexual and gender minority individuals). Explaining the source of loneliness in these diverse groups
will be a critical step toward mitigating loneliness and improving population health."

Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) drives substantial disability and US healthcare spending, yet
further understanding of the multiple possible mechanisms is needed in order to develop treatments. Cognitive
deficits in PD are associated with cholinergic denervation mediated through regional α4β2 nicotinic cholinergic
receptor (α4β2-nAChR) binding changes. Animal evidence implicates the same receptors in the generation of
brain oscillations that are a mechanism of normal brain function. Abnormal oscillations in the β band or phase-
amplitude coupling (PAC) between β and γ frequencies correlate with motor symptoms in PD. Abnormal
oscillations also exist in brain regions and networks associated with cognitive functions. Our overall objective of
this exploratory R21 is to understand the relationship between α4β2-nAChR signaling and pathological brain
oscillations in regions involved in cognitive impairment in PD. With converging evidence for the role of α4β2-
nAChR's in PD-related cognitive dysfunction and slow oscillations, we hypothesize that defective signaling
through α4β2-nAChR's is related to pathological oscillations and oscillation coupling and is one mechanism of
cognitive impairment in PD. The proposed study combines cognitive testing, molecular imaging of α4β2-
nAChR's with a unique radioligand ([18F]XTRA) with good signal-to-noise characteristics for imaging cortical
and hippocampal regions, and intracranial recordings from STN and subdural electrodes over cortical regions
known to a) be involved in the cognitive deficits seen in PD, b) have elevated β oscillation power in PD, and c)
show abnormal α4β2-nAChR availability in PD. Aim 1 is to determine whether α4β2-nAChR availability in
persons with PD positively correlates with the cortical β power or β-γ phase-amplitude coupling and STN-
cortex coherence as measured by intracranial recordings over regions involved in cognition during deep brain
stimulation (DBS) surgery. We hypothesize: 1) Higher α4β2-nAChR availability (BPND) in the left DLPFC and
right parietal cortex will be associated with higher β power and β-γ PAC recorded via a subdural electrode strip
in these regions at rest, adjusting for age; and 2) Higher α4β2-nAChR availability will be associated with
greater subthalamic nucleus (STN) β power locally and β phase coherence with the left DLPFC and right
parietal cortex, regions associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD. Aim 2 is to evaluate whether α4β2-nAChR
availability and β band power or β-γ phase-amplitude coupling over the DLPFC and parietal cortices are
associated with executive and visuospatial dysfunction in PD, where we hypothesize: 1) Higher α4β2-nAChR
availability and LFP β band power and/or β-γ PAC in the left DLPFC will correlate with worse problem-solving,
working memory, and set-shifting, and in the right parietal cortex, with worse visuospatial perception, and 2)
Higher associative STN LFP β band power and α4β2-nAChR availability will correlate with deficits in attention.
This study would generate a neurophysiologic biomarker and inform development of both pharmacologic and
neuromodulation treatments for cognitive impairment in PD."

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading global cause of morbidity and mortality, yet the immune
correlates of protection remain elusive. Improved understanding of the initial immune events
following Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) exposure that determine progression to infection and
active disease is a critical priority for developing novel immune therapies and vaccines. Our
laboratory studies innate lymphocyte biology and utilizes systems immunology approaches to
identify targets for immune therapies against TB. In this proposal, we will focus on one of the
most abundant innate lymphocytes responding to Mtb, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT)
cells, that recognize activating/inhibitory microbial metabolites of riboflavin metabolism that act as
non-peptide antigens presented by the evolutionarily conserved MHC I-related protein, MR1.
While MAIT cells are activated by Mtb in vitro and in vivo, they do not robustly expand after
infection. Moreover, MAIT cells are depleted during chronic murine and human TB disease. Our
working hypothesis to explain this observation is that Mtb synthesizes an abundance of inhibitory
MR1 ligands, which suppress MAIT cell activity and contribute to immune evasion. We have
recently developed LC-MS technologies to detect MR1 ligands within biological samples and will
couple this platform with our expertise in in mycobacterial genetics and TB immunology to define
the MR1 metabolome of Mtb as compared to non-mycobacterial species as well as Mtb riboflavin
auxotrophs we will generate by inducible CRISPRi knockdown to transiently perturb specific
branchpoints of mycobacterial riboflavin biosynthesis. In parallel, we will quantify Mtb-specific
MR1 ligands and MR1 expression/MAIT cell function in vivo during initial Mtb exposure and
infection in humans who have been recently exposed to Mtb in their household. In sum, our
approach will identify MR1 ligands specific to Mtb metabolism and determine their impact on
MR1/MAIT cell activity, informing future targeting of Mtb Vitamin B metabolism in TB immune
therapies and mucosal vaccines."

 The first 1,000 days (conception to age 2) have been deemed a critical period for obesity prevention yet,
effective, sustainable efforts are lacking. Current home visitation programs (HVP) targeting at-risk families for
other child development related issues are a potential innovative opportunity for early childhood obesity
prevention. The overall goal of the project is to reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children
under the age of 1 year thereby reducing obesity rates of older children and adults in the long term. Prior pilot
work by members of the research team demonstrated feasibility of embedding an early childhood obesity
prevention (ECHO) program in an existing home visitation program (HVP+) during an infant’s first year of life.
Five obesity-associated behaviors (i.e., breastfeeding, introduction to solids, limiting juice, sleep routines,
screen time) were emphasized through brief interactive lessons utilizing behavior change strategies and an
ecological approach by providing linkages to community resources that support healthy behaviors. The pilot
program was well received by families, mothers breastfed longer, infants had fewer nocturnal awakenings,
were less likely to receive juice, and had a lower weight-for-length (WFL) z-score at 12 months. However, there
is a critical need for alternative and innovative, consistent, and sustainable digital delivery methods especially
during times when face-to-face home visits are not feasible. Qualitative interviews were conducted with home
visitors (n=27) from Florida’s (FL) Maternal, Infant Early Childhood Home Visitation (MIECHV) Program and
revealed that they were highly receptive to using digital learning with at-risk families.
 The specific aims of the proposed research are to a) Develop, refine, and conduct usability testing of early
childhood obesity prevention digital learning modules with mothers (n=30) participating in FL MIECHV; and b)
Conduct a pilot RCT of a 12 month digitally-enhanced early childhood obesity prevention intervention
(HVP+E), with 50 mother-infant pairs (25 HVP+E/25 standard HVP) participating in FL MIECHV to determine
feasibility and acceptability of the HVP+E intervention and study recruitment, implementation and evaluation
protocols; and obtain data on preliminary efficacy of the intervention on children’s WFL z-scores (primary
outcome), maternal feeding practices, child sleep and screen time (secondary outcomes).
 Mother-infant dyads (n=50) enrolled in the Maternal, Infant Early Childhood Home Visitation (MIECHV)
Program parentally or within one month of giving birth will be randomized to receive either the standard home
visitation program (HVP) or the digitally delivered obesity prevention-enhanced home visitation program
(HVP+E) for 1 year. HVP+E content will also be expanded to support mothers in engaging fathers and other
family members in target behaviors. Mother-infant dyads will be assessed at study entry and at 6 and 12
months. If efficacious, the intervention has potential for public health impact through early childhood obesity
prevention in an underserved population, and dissemination through home visitation programs nationwide."

Brain somatic mosaicism (BSM) refers to the accumulation of mutations within any of the billions of cells in
the human brain, which can occur from embryogenesis through adulthood. The extent, impact and
mechanisms of BSM on brain disease remain poorly understood. Prior work from the Brain Somatic
Mosaicism Network (BSMN), on which the PI served, made critical breakthroughs in reliability of mosaicism
detection, but also raised new questions, including the degree to which BSM exists in the healthy brain, and
the mechanisms by which BSM mutations explain disease.
 Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is associated with substantial neuropsychiatric disability, and is the
most common cause of intractable epilepsy in childhood. Neuropsychiatric features are seen in 15-59% of
patients 5-7, and neuropathologically shows disrupted neurogenesis, migration, differentiation, and altered
neural excitability. We and others previously identified mosaic mutations in the mTOR pathway in a minority
of FCD cases, but most cases remain unsolved, and fundamental mechanisms are lacking.
 We hypothesize that: 1] FCD mutations are similar to neutral somatic mutations in their patterns and
distributions, dictated by developmental processes, but differ in their functional effect. 2] BSM patterns, allelic
fractions (AFs) and allele sharing between cells can reconstruct cellular lineages and migratory histories. 3]
Study of FCD resected tissue can uncover novel causes of disease that would not be tolerated if present in
every cell. 4] BSM modeling in mouse can unravel disrupted signaling networks of complex mosaic mutations.
 Our preliminary data shows: 1] From a post-mortem control cadaver, we validated 259 somatic
variants using 300X genome sequencing, and started to use these variants as ‘barcodes’ to reconstruct
lineage histories. 2] Deep sequencing from 314 FCD patient brain resections identified 12 new candidate
genes, highlighting signaling and synaptic dysfunction, and a novel ‘two-hit’ disease mechanisms. 3] We
established in utero mouse electroporation models to assess putative FCD variants as gain or loss of function,
and to assess effects of ‘single-hit’ and ‘two-hit’ mutations.
 We propose three aims: 1] From control cadavers, we will reconstruct cell lineage across anatomical
domains using BSM as barcodes. 2] With this lineage information, we will study the origins of BSM
mutations in FCD, by recruiting new patients, performing both targeted and unbiased sequencing, and
identifying novel causes. 3] We will functionally validate putative deleterious alleles in animal models for
both ‘single-hit’ and ‘two-hit’ causes. The goal is to achieve a mechanistic understanding of the
extent of BSM in control individuals, to reconstruct neural lineages and to identify novel mechanisms in
developmental brain disease."
10890676,"Project Summary/Abstract
Platelets are arguably the most important cellular participant in hemostasis and thrombosis. Many therapeutic
strategies target platelet molecules to inhibit their functions in thrombosis. In particular, two membrane adhesion
receptors, glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX and GPIIb-IIIa (integrin IIb3), cooperatively mediate platelet adhesion and
thrombus formation under high shear flow, and thus are ideal targets for inhibiting thrombosis in stenotic arteries
as well as in microvasculature. Also, all anti-platelet drugs currently being used to treat thrombosis clinically have
adverse hemorrhagic side effects, because the platelet plug formation required to stop bleeding is also inhibited.
Under the support of this grant in its past period, we and others showed that both GPIbα and IIb3 are
mechanoreceptors capable of receiving mechanical cues. We found that GPIb mechano-signaling leads to
integrin inside-out signaling, which activates IIb3 from the inactive state having a bent conformation and a
closed headpiece (BC) with a low affinity and short bond lifetime for ligand to an intermediate state having an
extended conformation but a closed headpiece (EC) with an intermediate affinity and intermediate bond lifetime
for ligand, which is distinct from the fully active state of IIb3 often seen in platelets stimulated by soluble agonists
that has an extended conformation and an open headpiece (EO) with a high affinity and long bond lifetime for
ligand. Significantly, the intermediate state of IIb3 mediates the formation of “biomechanical thrombi”, consisting
of transient and unstable platelet aggregates resembling the dynamic outer layer of an in vivo thrombus formed
under high shear blood flow, which is distinct from platelet aggregates underneath the outer layer that are further
stimulated by released soluble agonists and where IIb3 are further activated to the fully active EO state. Further
activation from the intermediate state to the fully active state can also be induced by IIb3 outside-in mechano-
signaling, which also induces further activation of platelets. These data highlight the role of force-induced
signaling – mechano-signaling – of, by, and between GPIb-IX and IIb3, and their unique importance in thrombus
formation. Our overarching hypothesis is that a balanced regulation of mechano-signals of GPIbα and IIb3, and
their synergy with biochemical signals induced by soluble platelet agonists, holds the promise to control
thrombosis without unsetting hemostasis. The specific aims are to elucidate 1) the roles of 14-3-3ζ and filamin
A on GPIbα ligand-binding, unfolding and mechano-signaling, 2) the mechanism of GPIb-IX mechanosensing-
induced intracellular signaling pathway leading to integrin activation, and 3) the roles of G13, talin1 and Rap1
on GPIIb-IIIa binding, conformation and mechano-signaling. These studies will characterize the ligand-binding
and signaling of of two major platelet mechanoreceptors, GPIb and GPIIb-IIIa, as related to hemostasis and thrombosis.
The results will provide insights into vascular physiology and pathology and help develop therapeutic strategies
to treat thrombus formation with minimal adverse bleeding side effects."

Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments.
Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring
developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant exposures
in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment, structural
racism, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child development, it is
imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of life be established
based on a sufficiently large and demographically diverse sample of the US population. To accomplish this, the
Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium (HBCD-NC) has been formed to deploy a
harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented by an
extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand
neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,500 mothers and infants enrolled at 24 sites across the United
States (US). The HBCD-NC will carry out a common research protocol under direction of the HBCD-NC
Administrative Core (HCAC) and will assemble and distribute a comprehensive and well-curated research
dataset to the scientific community at large under the direction of the HBCD-NC Data Coordinating Center
(HDCC). The overarching goal of the HBCD-NC is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-
dimensional dataset that will characterize typical neurodevelopmental trajectories in US children and that will
assess how biological and environmental exposures affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be placed
on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and/or other
substances. To address these broad objectives, the sample of women enrolled will include: 1) a racially,
ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse cohort that is representative of the US population; 2) pregnant woman
with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3) demographically and behaviorally
similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal inferences. In addition, the HBCD-NC
will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and protective environments have the most
influence on later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The large, multi-modal, longitudinal, and generalizable dataset
that will be produced for the first time by this study will provide novel insights into child development using state-
of-the-art methods. The HBCD-NC study will inform public policy to improve the health and development of
children across the nation."

Diarrhea-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D) is the most common cause of chronic diarrhea in the
United States. A diet high in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols
(FODMAPs) (HFM) induces symptoms in IBS-D patients and a diet low in FODMAPs (LFM) provides some
symptomatic relief in ~50-60% of these patients. However, we do not understand how FODMAPs affect IBS-D
symptoms. In this proposal, I plan to delineate the mechanisms of FODMAP-mediated IBS-D pathophysiology,
which will help identify a subgroup of IBS-D patients with a distinct pathophysiologic pathway ultimately leading
to targeted therapy with improved efficacy. My strong preliminary data suggest LFM reduces the fecal
abundance of Akkermansiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae and LPS levels in IBS-D patients. Moreover, I found
that LFM improves colonic barrier function and reduces mast cell activation in LFM-responsive IBS-D patients.
Finally, my preliminary work from in vivo rodent models suggests that luminal LPS and mast cells play a critical
role in the FODMAP-mediated colonic barrier loss. Based on these preliminary data, my overall hypothesis is
that HFM increases fecal LPS levels by increasing the abundance of pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. This
luminal LPS initiates colonic epithelial barrier loss and activates mast cells causing the release of tryptase
which further potentiates colonic barrier loss. I will test these hypotheses in two specific aims: In specific aim
1, I will elucidate the contributions of FODMAPs in IBS-D pathophysiology by determining the effect of a
strictly-controlled 4-week LFM on clinical features, relative and absolute abundance of fecal gram-negative
bacteria (including those detailed above) and LPS, colonic barrier function, and mucosal mast cell activation in
IBS-D patients and comparing the changes in these pathophysiologic parameters among LFM-responders and
non-responders. In specific aim 2, I will define the mechanisms by which FODMAPs induce epithelial barrier
loss and mast-cell activation in IBS-D. I will do so by applying IBS-D fecal supernatants (pre- and post-LFM) to
human colonoids with/without TLR4 antagonists. In parallel, I will also apply fecal supernatants to mast cells
from wild type and tlr4-/- mice to assess tryptase release. Finally, I will determine the contributions of PAR2
receptor and myosin light chain kinase signaling in tryptase-mediated barrier loss in human colonoid model.
These aims will address current gaps in our understanding of IBS-D pathophysiology and provide mentored
training in the assessment of in vivo and ex vivo epithelial barrier structure and function, microbiome analysis,
and in vitro human colonoid model to study epithelial barrier regulation. My mentorship committee comprises of
internationally renowned NIH-funded investigators with an exceptional track record of mentoring- Drs. Owyang
(expert in IBS pathophysiology), Drs. Nusrat and Turner (experts in barrier function), and Dr. Schmidt (expert in
microbiome). The mentored training will enable me to become an independent clinical-translational investigator
defining IBS mechanisms and applying that knowledge in clinical studies to develop IBS precision therapies."

10864049,"Project Summary
Opioid therapy for pain in patients with metastatic cancer is a critical yet understudied area. Pain is
experienced at some point by most patients with metastatic cancer. Prescribed opioids are a cornerstone of
treating pain; the prevalent belief in the field has been that the benefits of palliating pain in metastatic cancer
with opioids nearly always outweigh any potential harms. This approach to opioid-related decisions in patients
with metastatic cancer implies that patients’ prognoses are either so short that these harms are not
meaningful, or that benefits of opioids are substantial while harms are relatively minimal. Research on the
benefits and harms of opioid therapy has exploded in the past decade but primarily focuses on individuals with
chronic “non-cancer” pain. However, patients with cancer have been routinely excluded from these studies and
resulting recommendations that favor more conservative opioid prescribing. The few studies of patients with
cancer generally support that serious harms occur, but have significant methodologic limitations. Additionally,
there are unique considerations in individuals with metastatic cancer, including life-limiting disease that may
last years, high pain rates, and opioids as accepted standard of care. Therefore, assessing benefits and risk
factors for opioid-related harms in individuals with metastatic cancer is a critical gap in the literature and key to
opioid-related decision-making. The long-term goal of this program of research is to develop interventions that
inform opioid-related decision-making for patients with metastatic cancer. We will use the Behavioral Decision
Research framework to create a comprehensive evidence base on which these interventions can be grounded,
which is the objective of the present application. To accomplish our aims, we have partnered with the NINR-
funded Palliative Care Research Cooperative to develop a prospective cohort of patients newly diagnosed with
metastatic cancer. We propose the following Aims in patients with metastatic cancer: Aim 1: Investigate the
relationship between opioid therapy and opioid-related benefits. Hypothesis 1: Opioid therapy will be
associated with decreased pain severity and pain interference (co-primary outcomes). Aim 2: Investigate risk
factors for opioid-related harms. Hypothesis 2a: Certain co-prescribed medications will be associated with
increased risk of opioid side effects (e.g., benzodiazepines and somnolence). Hypothesis 2b: Younger age,
history of substance use disorder, and history of mood disorders will be associated with greater risk of opioid
misuse and use disorder. Approach: We will use linear mixed effects models (2a) and time-to-event analyses
(2b). Aim 3: Understand stakeholder (patient, family caregiver, clinician) perspectives on opioid-related
decision-making. Completion of these aims will lead directly to an R-series proposal to develop and test a
novel intervention to inform opioid decision-making, followed by R-series proposals to study intervention
effectiveness and implementation. This work has the potential to transform opioid prescribing and pain
management for patients with metastatic cancer."
10892117,"Abstract
 Maintaining an equilibrium between inflammatory Th17 cells and anti-inflammatory Treg cells is critical to
support intestinal barrier function and tissue homeostasis. Nuclear hormone receptors (NhRs) have been
shown to play crucial roles in the development and function of key immune cells, including Th17 and Treg cells.
Based on our prior work, we hypothesize that host-produced, bacterially modified steroids bind to host NhRs
and modulate T cell differentiation and function. Specifically, we posit that secondary bile acids (microbial
metabolites of host-produced primary bile acids) bind to host NhRs and modulate T cell differentiation and
function.
 We previously demonstrated that two bile acid metabolites modulate T cell differentiation: 3-oxo-
lithocholic acid (3oxoLCA) inhibits the differentiation of naïve T cells into inflammatory Th17 cells, and isoallo-
lithocholic acid (isoalloLCA) enhances the differentiation of naïve T cells into anti-inflammatory Treg cells.
Although we determined that 3oxoLCA inhibited Th17 cells by acting as a ligand for RORγt (retinoic acid
receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor γ t), it is unknown whether isoalloLCA exerts its Treg cell-modulating
activity by acting through NhR(s). In addition, it is likely that there are additional bile acids that modulate T cell
responses. In preliminary work, we have identified an abundant bile acid metabolite, iso-lithocholic acid
(isoLCA) that inhibits Th17 cell differentiation and function, as well as human gut bacteria that produce isoLCA
and isoalloLCA. We have found that the levels of these metabolites are significantly decreased in the feces of
human patients with Crohn’s disease compared to healthy controls. We propose to (1) identify human gut
bacteria and bacterial genes responsible for the production of isoLCA and isoalloLCA, (2) determine the
molecular mechanisms by which these compounds influence Th17 and Treg differentiation and function, and (3)
investigate whether gut bacteria producing isoLCA and isoalloLCA affect host immune responses in vivo.
 Elucidating the pathways that produce immunomodulatory bile acids and their mechanisms of action
will open up exciting avenues to study unique regulatory interactions between gut-residing microorganisms and
host immune cells. This research will lay the groundwork for the development of new therapies to treat
autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease."

Cannabinoid signaling is composed of Cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 and their cognate exogenous
and endogenous ligands. Cannabinoid signaling is widely distributed throughout the CNS and periphery
and is implicated in a wide variety of important neurobiological processes including regulation of energy
homeostasis, learning and memory, motor function, reward, anxiety, and social function. Moreover, use of
cannabis has increases over the past decade and is expected to continue to increase in the face of the
expanding anti-prohibition movement in the United States. Cannabis use by vulnerable populations and
during critical periods, such as adolescence and pregnancy, carry unclear risk and are the focus of intense
ongoing scientific investigation. Commensurate with these growing potential public health concerns,
research into the fundamental biology of cannabinoids and endogenous cannabinoids related to brain
development, function, and pathology are becoming of greater interest to the public, policymakers,
researchers and healthcare professionals. Therefore, understanding the neurobiology of cannabinoid
signaling could have broad implications for physiological function and the pathophysiology of somatic and
neuropsychiatric disorders. The International Cannabinoid Research Society (ICRS) is the only annual
scientific meeting devoted to dissemination of scientific information on all aspects of cannabinoid sciences.
The ICRS will hold its 31st annual symposium in 2021 and has been an unparalleled success in the field of
cannabinoid research. During the previous funding cycle, NIH support has allowed the ICRS to provide
substantial travel support to increase trainee attendance at our annual meeting. The student travel grant
program will be used to increase the participation of early stage cannabinoid researchers in the ICRS
Symposia on the Cannabinoids. Special emphasis has been, and will continue to be, placed on support for
individuals traditionally underrepresented in science, including women and U.S. racial and ethnic
minorities. In addition to the travel award program, we propose to provide a career development program
at each annual ICRS symposium, recognize outstanding predoctoral and postdoctoral student
presentations with awards given during each symposium, and publish an abstract book in printed form that
will be made available to the public on the ICRS website after the annual symposium. Completion of these
aims will continue to invigorate the next generation of cannabinoid scientists by facilitating attendance and
presentation of their original research in an open, inclusive, and egalitarian forum and provide networking
and mentorship opportunities to young scientists in all areas of cannabinoid research."
10923858,"PROJECT SUMMARY – OVERVIEW
Cystic Fibrosis results from the absence or dysfunction of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance
Regulator (CFTR) chloride channel. Defects in CFTR are strongly associated with genetic variations in the CFTR
gene that are unique to individual CF patients or to subgroups within the CF patient population. Thus, a
personalized medicine approach helps customize care to individual CF patients based on the unique molecular
and phenotypic characteristics associated with their CFTR gene. In this renewal application we will promote
clinical, translational, and basic research collaboration to improve CF therapy and patient quality of life through
personalized medicine with an emphasis to address CF minority population. This goal will be achieved through
3 integrated cores: Personalized Clinical Core, Personalized Model Systems Core and the new CF-Organ-on-a
Chip Core. This will drive successful therapeutic outcomes and minimize potential adverse effects of chronic
therapies. Given that the largest benefit of highly effective modulators is on lung function with little tangible effect
on CF related diabetes, the focus of the CF-Organ-on-a Chip Core will be the study of mechanisms of diabetes
in ductal and endocrine pancreatic cells lacking CFTR in multiple genetic mutations. We will leverage an IRB
approved genotype-phenotype database available for clinical and research use, to develop Personalized Cystic
Fibrosis Therapy and Research Center (PCFC) for individual patients to (i) determine his/her susceptibility to a
particular form of CF mutation, and ii) take steps to mitigate the early onset of the disease. Finally, the future of
CF research offers the potential for a variety of CFTR-targeted therapies (i e., CFTR modulators) to treat the
underlying cause of CF, with multiple modulators currently in different stages of development."
10923864,"SUMMARY:
The administrative core will promote interaction among researchers and clinicians with interest in CF/CFTR-
related research. The implementation of this thematic program, Personalized Medicine in CF, will be its most
important goal. Toward this end, the Core will develop a strategic plan; oversee the operations at the Center
including budget, core services, the P/F Program, enrichment programs, and membership management. The
administration will help shape an excellent research environment for CF/CFTR-related studies by promoting
and fostering collaboration between the basic, translational, and clinical investigators. The Administrative Core
will provide support to three biomedical cores for their facilities and services and will be proactive in developing
patient outreach programs. The ultimate goal is to develop personalized therapy for individuals with CF to
improve their quality or life and wellbeing."

Engaged Research Council (C-CERC), and the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB) program,
including evaluation, guidance and setting priorities and services that are consistent with the NIH HIV priorities
and Ending the HIV Epidemic; 3) Facilitate collaboration and communication across our CFAR, partner
institutions, other CFARs, and communities, engage the C-CERC for input regarding Core services and scientific
activities, work with members of our Internal Advisory Committee and External Scientific Advisory Committee
and to review the progress of our CFAR services and implement changes as necessary; and 4) In collaboration
with the Developmental Core, provide leadership in training, education, and mentorship of early stage and early
career investigators by providing direct funding for innovative and collaborative research efforts, promote
recruitment of new investigators and the training of early stage investigators, particularly under-represented
minority investigators, in high priority HIV/AIDS research. Efforts in this aim will focus on assuring a training
pipeline for future scientists with an interest towards innovative HIV research.
The Administrative Core successfully increased our institutional support through a negotiated indirect cap of
25%, no indirect costs for developmental awards, and monetary support from both institutions specifically
designated for developmental awards for early stage investigators both domestically and globally. In this cycle,
our institutions have hired 34 new faculty in HIV research."

on marginalized populations including substance users, men who have sex with men, justice involved persons,
women, gender minority and at-risk youth. As the worldwide HIV epidemic evolves, the Developmental Core
(Core B) is evolving in parallel in order to catalyze innovative scientific leadership. We focus our efforts on early
stage investigators (ESI), trainee and faculty populations who are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical,
behavioral and social sciences research enterprise, and senior investigators not yet involved in HIV work, so that
they can become the leaders of the future. Our Specific Aims are as follows:
 1. Aim 1. Provide short-term funding for HIV/AIDS specific research awards and mentoring for early career
 investigators (ESI) and investigators new to the HIV/AIDS research field.
 2. Aim 2. Facilitate comprehensive mentoring for HIV/AIDS investigators at all stages of project
 development and implementation.
 3. Aim 3. Provide state-of-the-art National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN) mentoring training to
 CFAR mentors.
Core B will continue to provide essential support for both ESI and established investigators, including timely
funding, creative mentoring, and valuable mentoring training. These efforts will include both the continuation of
existing, effective programs, and the development of several innovations for the next cycle. First, we have
developed a new type of domestic Developmental Grant focused on community-engaged research designed to
lead to future EHE funding. We will implement this new developmental award type in year five of the current
cycle, and continue it in the next cycle, with modifications as needed. Second, we will implement a new Grant
Resubmission Award of up to $10K designed to help those whose NIH grants were favorably scored, but not yet
funded. The goal of the award is to allow investigators to quickly and productively respond to reviewer’s
comments. Third, to foster social and scientific connectedness among developmental award recipients, we will
coordinate a series of meetings (6, 1-hour meetings/year) for awardees whose Developmental Grants are active.
Since 2013, Core B has provided $1.99M of developmental funding which has produced $40.2M in
subsequent NIH funding (ROI of 20:1), and in the last cycle we helped to attract 12 NIH supplemental
awards worth $2.1M. Our existing programs and new innovations, we believe, will help Core B to continue to

Substance use is a key risk factor for HIV transmission and a leading driver of morbidity and mortality among
people with HIV (PWH) globally. The Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) strategies and U.S. Office of AIDS
Research priorities of reducing comorbidities in PWH can only be achieved if clinical and public health
approaches effectively address the widespread impact of substance use and its causes. To meet these crucial
needs, the Substance Use Research Core (SURC) will support clinical, behavioral, translational, and basic
science substance use and HIV (SU/HIV) research by offering services to CFAR investigators at each stage of
a research project. The SURC will advance SU/HIV collaborations within and across CFARs and foster a diverse
research workforce. Accordingly, the SURC will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) To provide CFAR
investigators expertise in developing research that addresses substance use as an impediment to EHE
strategies and as a driver of HIV-associated comorbidities. The SURC will work with CFAR investigators to
formulate innovative and scientifically sound SU/HIV research questions, including questions that address
related syndemics and social determinants of health; and will ensure that CFAR projects appropriately consider
and incorporate the impact of substance use on HIV transmission, HIV viral suppression, and comorbidities
among PWH. 2) To support CFAR investigators in conducting rigorous and innovative research that addresses
crucial knowledge gaps around the impact of substance use on HIV outcomes. The SURC will advise and train
investigators on methods for assessing substance use by conducting workshops and curating resources; support
incorporation of effective and up to date substance use interventions; and assist with substance use intervention
selection, interventionist training, fidelity assessment, intervention manual development, and adaptation to
diverse and disadvantaged populations. 3) To serve as a regional and national resource on SU/HIV research.
The SURC will connect substance use investigators with HIV investigators to develop collaborative projects;
convene topic groups across Providence/Boston CFAR and provide individual mentoring for SU/HIV researchers
with an emphasis on investigators underrepresented in biomedical research. Importantly, the SURC will serve
as a national hub for collaborative SU/HIV research across CFARs, fostering exchange of ideas and enabling
synergies through shared expertise and resources. The SURC will leverage our Inter-CFAR Substance Use
Research Community, a nationwide SU/HIV research platform initiated and led by the SURC, to enhance
research capacity across CFARs. The SURC will act as a regional and national catalyst to quicken the pace,
depth, and impact of SU/HIV research and is uniquely positioned to support and prepare CFAR investigators to
pursue research projects that cut across SU/HIV research and move us closer to ending the HIV epidemic,
improving health outcomes for PWH, and addressing the intersection of SU/HIV in key populations."

SCIENTIFIC WORKING GROUP: HIV AND ORAL HEATH
The Providence/Boston (Prov/Bos) CFAR has established the HIV and Oral Health Scientific Working Group
(SWG) to address research gaps in our understanding of how HIV and associated co-morbidities contribute to
oral diseases and to develop new multidisciplinary research endeavors related to HIV and oral health, with a
focus on supporting early stage investigators. This SWG expands the mission of the Prov/Bos CFAR which is
focused on improving HIV and related health outcomes among vulnerable and marginalized populations
including women, youth, persons with substance use disorders, justice experienced, and those living in resource
poor settings both domestically and internationally. Persons with HIV (PWH) are at risk of many types of oral
diseases including HIV-related opportunistic infections, caries, periodontal disease, and oral cancers including
human papillomavirus (HPV)-related malignancy and squamous cell carcinoma with increased incidence among
PWH who smoke and drink alcohol. Opioid and stimulant use also contribute to oral diseases and poor access
to dental care and oral health screenings can significantly exacerbate these health challenges among PWH. In
addition, there are complex relationships between HIV and the oral mucosa related to chronic inflammation and
mucosal immunity that impact HIV transmission, latency, and treatment. This SWG responds to existing research
gaps by supporting innovative clinical, behavioral, translational, and basic science research intended to reduce
the incidence and morbidity of oral diseases among PWH. Scientific objectives of the SWG include: 1)
Developing and expanding the delivery of HIV testing, prevention, and linkage services in dental clinics to support
the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of HIV in high-risk populations; 2) Exploring the epidemiology and
natural history of oral HPV) infection, including HPV-related cancer, among PWH; 3) Examining the impact of
tobacco, alcohol, and drug use, and use of oral buprenorphine as treatment for opioid use disorder, as
contributors to oral diseases including cancer among PWH; 4) Advancing diagnostics and treatments for HIV-
related opportunistic infections of the oropharynx; 5) Supporting social and behavioral science research including
examining the impact of HIV-related stigma on access to dental care; and 6) Supporting translational and basic
science research including chronic inflammation in the oral cavity, HIV and mucosal epithelial interactions, HIV
and the oral microbiome, and HIV and immune mechanisms. The goals of the SWG are achieved through 1)
bimonthly SWG meetings; 2) quarterly Steering Committee meetings; and 3) an annual SWG research day. The

As our population ages, the prevalence of aging-related disorders such as cognitive decline, Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), and its related dementia (ADRD) is increasing, with poor or no prognosis, prevention, and
treatments. This, in turn, burdens families, society, and our healthcare system. Although, several recent
advances have led to the development of prognostic markers of ADRD including advanced imaging like MRI,
PET, and measurements of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood; but their
uses are impeded due to cost, invasiveness, and required frequency of measurements, with limitations in
sensitivity and accuracy. Thus, developing new, non-invasive, sensitive, and easy to frequently measure with
increased accuracy biomarkers for predicting the risk of early onset of cognitive decline and ADRD progression
is direly needed. Saliva is an attractive reservoir of biomarkers that can noninvasively and inexpensively be
collected with unlimited frequency. We hypothesize that saliva protein markers can differentiate mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) and dementia from cognitively healthy individuals. We also posit that these saliva protein
markers can predict the risk of MCI and dementia, and the inclusion of oral microbiome and systemic
inflammatory markers will strengthen the discriminatory and predictive power. Our hypothesis is based on
strong fundamental knowledge and preliminary data. The fact that the oral cavity’s mucosal and lymphatic
systems are connected to the brain circulations and are in physical proximity, which allows the bidirectional
exchange of molecules like proteins and peptides, between oral and brain systems. Abnormalities in the oral
microbiome and systemic inflammation are linked to the risk of cognitive decline and ADRD, but these
conclusions are drawn from small, cross-sectional, observational, and non-prospective risk prediction studies.
Here, using our ongoing large clinical cohort- Microbiome in aging Gut and Brain (MiaGB) consortium study,
we plan to globally analyze proteomics and oral microbiome in saliva along with markers of inflammation in
plasma of 60 cognitively normal, 60 MCI, and 40 dementia participants in both cross-sectional and prospective
follow-up studies to test our hypotheses. We plan two specific aims. In Aim 1 we will determine if unique
proteomic signatures differentiate subjects with MCI and dementia from cognitively healthy controls and if the
addition of microbiome and inflammatory markers boosts the distinction; and in Aim 2, we will determine if
saliva-based protein markers predict the risk of MCI and dementia progression and whether the inclusion of
microbiome and inflammation strengthens the prediction in older adults. Building on an already ongoing large
study and supported by compelling preliminary data and complementary expert team and interlinked aims, our
study is expected to establish proof of concept that saliva-based biomarkers will diagnose and predict the risk
of cognitive decline and dementia progression, which is increasingly common, costly, and debilitating public
health problems in older adults, while it is well aligned with the goals of PAR-22-094."

Understanding somatic genomic variation presents unique challenges, primarily stemming from
the individual rarity of most somatic mutations across cells in a multicellular organism. Hence,
both sensitivity and accuracy (due to the need to distinguish somatic variation from noise) become
crucially important. The Analysis of bulk DNA, even with ultraprecise approaches, only ascertains
a portion of the human genome. The analysis of single cells, either by cloning or in vitro whole-
genome amplification (WGA), enables discovering theoretically all mutations in a cell independent
of their frequency in bulk. However, amplifying single cell genomes in vitro represents still a
significant challenge in terms of accuracy of amplification. The novel PTA technique (primary
template directed amplification) offers substantially improved quality of amplified DNA. However,
PTA produces a relatively small amount of DNA fragments of moderate length. This limits the
application of long read sequencing. Long read sequencing is expected to be the most
comprehensive approach to somatic mutation detection. In the proposed project, we will, first,
perform long-read sequencing in single cells cloned via the production of iPSC lines to study
somatic mutation of all types using non-enzymatically amplified genomic DNA, from telomere to
telomere, and generate a gold-standard benchmarking resource for methods development.
Second, we will address a significant shortcoming of the analysis of single cell genomes, which
is the lack of direct information about the exact type of cell being analyzed, or about potential
functional consequences of mutations in that cell. For that, we will benchmark the new
ResolveOme method, an expansion of PTA, that can analyze in parallel the genome and
transcriptome of a single cell. Third, we will address the challenge of high-throughput analysis of
single cells to detect somatic structural variants. Specifically, we will establish and benchmark for
SMaHT the Strand-seq method that allows for high-throughput detection and characterization of
structural variants (SVs) in single cells. Together, this will address 3 critical needs in the analysis
of somatic mutations in normal tissues: comprehensive mosaic mutation discovery, phenotyping
the cell harboring mutations and directly assessing functional consequences of mutations, and
accurate and high-throughput detection of SVs. Another important aspect of the project will be
comprehensive comparative analyses of detected somatic variants across all Aims."

Asthma is a lung disease caused by exaggerated lung inflammation leading to airway obstruction and
compromised airflow. Despite significant advances in its diagnosis and treatment, asthma continues to be a
significant health problem affecting more than 25 million patients in the US, and over 300 million around the
world. Well-characterized sex and gender differences in asthma have been reported, with changes in morbidity
throughout life. Starting around puberty and peaking during mid-life, women have increased asthma prevalence
and higher rates of asthma exacerbations than men. Causes of these disparities remain unclear; however,
studies have shown that sex-specific inflammatory mechanisms controlled by hormones contribute to differences
in airway reactivity in response to environmental stimuli. Despite this, experimental models of asthma have not
explored the contributions of sex hormones to inflammatory mechanisms in the female and male lung, and no
studies have explored the effects of feminizing hormone therapy with estrogen in the lungs of trans women. Prior
studies from our laboratory using mouse models have reported sex differences and influences of the estrous
cycle and circulating sex hormones in the inflammatory response to environmental exposures. Based on these
findings, we hypothesized that female sex hormones, specifically estrogens, contribute to asthma phenotypes
in the lung via activation of inflammatory mechanisms mediated by estrogen receptors. In the proposed study,
we will test this hypothesis by determining the mechanisms by which estrogen mediates sex and gender
influences in asthma. In Aim 1, we will determine the contributions of sex chromosome complement (XX vs. XY)
vs. gonadal hormones in asthma phenotypes, by developing a mouse house dust mite (HDM) asthma model on
the four core genotypes (FCG) model. In Aim 2, we will study the contributions of estrogens to HDM-induced
asthma outcomes using male and female gonadectomized mice treated with estradiol, as well as bronchial
epithelial cells from male and female healthy and asthma patients to exposed to HDM in the presence/absence
of estrogen receptor agonists/antagonists. In Aim 3, we will determine the roles of nuclear (ER) and membrane-
bound (GPER-1) estrogen receptors in estrogen-mediated mechanisms of inflammation in HDM-induced
asthma, using ER and GPER1 knockout mice. Our studies will be the first to characterize estrogen-mediated
mechanisms of inflammation in asthma phenotypes in the male and female lung, contributing to the
characterization of sex- and gender-specific factors accounting for inter-individual differences, as well as the
effects of feminizing hormone therapy in lung pathobiology. We expect that our studies would serve to develop
potential sex- and gender-specific treatments and recommendations for dosage of therapeutic agents to treat
and prevent asthma in cis and transgender women."
10872264,"Project Summary/Abstract
Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, are highly expressed in human and murine
thymus. Despite this knowledge, the function of the PD-1 signaling pathway during T cell development has been
severely understudied. In the past decade, immunotherapies inhibiting the PD-1:PD-L1 axis have produced
remarkable improvements in the clinical management of several malignancies, at least in part by restoring T cell
receptor (TCR) signaling within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, because TCR
signaling is essential for thymocyte development, we postulate PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors may have profound effects
on the function and specificity of newly generated T cells. These thymus-specific actions may highlight a key
unexplored mechanism by which PD-1 blockade elicits anti-tumor immune responses. Leveraging this pathway
for pediatric cancer patients may be particularly beneficial considering their high rate of thymic T cell production.
Our preliminary data illustrate that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) administered in conjunction with anti-PD-1
therapy expands the T cell pool and helps overcome treatment-resistance in murine glioblastoma. This may
suggest anti-PD-1 therapy acts within the thymus to promote the proliferation and maturation of HSC-derived
thymocytes. Importantly, pediatric high-grade glioma (HGG) is the prevailing cause of cancer-related death in
children which emphasizes the need for new therapies. Thus it is our priority to investigate this novel pathway
with the goal of improving the standard of care for pediatric HGG and other childhood tumors. Our objective is
to characterize how inhibiting PD-1 signaling modifies thymocyte development in health and HGG. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that PD-1 inhibition increases thymic T cell production and promotes the positive
selection, or survival, of tumor-specific TCRs. Aim 1 will determine the impact of PD-1 blockade on the
proliferation, selection, and output of developing thymocytes in healthy and glioma-bearing mice. Aim 2 will
assess the thymic contribution towards the therapeutic response in the context of PD-1 inhibiton and HSC
transfer. This work is significant because no prior study has investigated how thymus-specific PD-1 blockade
impacts anti-tumor immune responses. The results from this study have the potential to substantially influence
clinical decision making and treatment regimens for pediatric HGG patients. This project is innovative because
it will utilize nontransgenic mouse models to more accurately define how PD-1 inhibition affects thymus
physiology in health and disease. In summary this proposal will comprehensively characterize how the PD-1
pathway modulates T cell development and will investigate a novel thymic mechanism that may revolutionize
our understanding of anti-PD-1 therapy in cancer."
10873796,"Psychosocial traumatic events, and interpersonal violence experiences in particular, during childhood serve as
strong and consistent predictors of substance use problems (SUP) during adolescence and adulthood. PTSD
that extends from such IPV often co-occurs with SUP. Despite this well-established link, standard care for
adolescents with co-occurring SUP and PTSD for the last several decades has been to treat these problems
separately. This compartmentalized approach to treatment creates burden on teens and families, raises unique
challenges to clinicians in both mental health and addiction domains, and may contribute to high rates of SUP
relapse among adolescents with co-occurring PTSD. To address this problem, our team recently completed a
rigorous NIDA-funded randomized controlled trial (RCT) supporting the efficacy of an integrative, exposure-
based treatment we developed, Risk Reduction through Family Therapy (RRFT), in greater long term reductions
in SUP, as well as PTSD avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms, in comparison to standard treatment in a large
teen sample. The proposed RCT, with an effectiveness-implementation Hybrid Type I design, substantially builds
on that prior research by proposing to: 1) evaluate whether RRFT's clinical effectiveness for reducing SUP and
PTSD can be extended to youth in outpatient substance use treatment settings—where youth are presenting for
SUP treatment and where clinicians often have less experience treating PTSD (Aim 1); 2) evaluate the cost-
effectiveness of RRFT and to explore inner context variables (e.g., perceived treatment acceptability, attitudes,
and satisfaction among the participating adolescents, caregivers, agency leaders, and therapists and barriers to
and facilitators of implementation) that might affect RRFT implementation in diverse practice settings (Aim 2).
The proposed effectiveness-implementation trial will recruit adolescents (13-18 years) with a history of IPV
presenting with SUP and PTSD symptoms for outpatient substance use disorder treatment at sites in Denver,
Colorado affiliated with NIDA's Clinical Trials Network. Participants will be urn randomized to RRFT or Treatment
as Usual. A multi-method, multi-respondent approach will track clinical outcomes (SUP, PTSD, and putative
targets of treatment, such as emotional suppression) at 3, 6, and 12 months post-baseline. To reduce the
science-to-practice gap, as an Exploratory Aim, we will assemble and engage an Advisory Board of leaders
from Colorado state departments (Offices of Behavioral Health and Criminal/Juvenile Justice for Colorado, which
have committed to participate) and community mental health organizations that oversee policy and decision-
making in selection and implementation of psychosocial treatments for high-risk adolescents, with the goal of
building capacity for large scale (e.g., state-wide) uptake of evidence-interventions for teen SUP and PTSD, like
RRFT, upon completion of the grant. This proposal is directly in line with NIDA's recent release of NOT-DA-20-
004, a Notice of Special Interest encouraging research on comorbid substance use, substance use disorders,
and other psychiatric disorders."
10873175,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Numerous endogenous agents, environmental carcinogens, and anti-cancer drugs produce bulky base adducts
in the genome. It is expected that the location of these adducts is non-random and that their locations dictate
their pathogenic or therapeutic effects as well as their susceptibility to DNA repair enzymes that modulate these
effects. The long-term goal of our research program is to better understand DNA damage and repair at the
genomic level to aid in predicting and potentially preventing DNA adduct-induced carcinogenesis as well as to
design efficient chemotherapeutic regimens with minimal side effects. The objective of this particular proposal is
to use our novel adductomic-mapping methods (Damage-seq and XR-seq) to locate the exact positions of DNA
lesions in the mammalian genome and the exact positions of DNA incisions performed by the nucleotide excision
repair enzyme system that removes the DNA damage. The rationale for the proposed research is that mapping
damage and repair may reveal unexpected links between environmental carcinogens, mutagenesis, disease and
ageing. We will accomplish this goal by carrying out the following three specific aims: 1) Genomic Single-
nucleotide Resolution Analysis of DNA Damage by Endogenous Agents; 2) Genome-wide Single Nucleotide
Resolution Maps of DNA Damage and Repair by Exogenous Carcinogens; 3) Genome-wide Damage and Repair
Maps of Anticancer Drugs. For this proposal, we will focus on identifying the precise locations and removal of
DNA base damage formed endogenously (glycosylation, oxidative damage) and damage caused by
environmental carcinogens (aflatoxin, diethylnitrosamine) and anticancer drugs (cisplatin, melphalan). Methods
that we developed and further optimized for mapping damage formation and repair will be used throughout this
work. This proposal is innovative because of these unique sequencing technologies that provide high-resolution
DNA sequence information on the formation and repair of damage throughout the entire genome and provide an
unparalleled approach for characterizing endogenous DNA damage as well as damage induced by
environmental carcinogens and anti-cancer drugs. The proposed research is significant because it will address
the question of the role of DNA damage by endogenous agents (glycosylation) of various tissues and its overall
contribution to aging by these methods developed in our laboratory which have unprecedented sensitivity for
genome-wide mapping at single nucleotide resolution in different organs. In addition, the proposed research will
expand our understanding of DNA damage formation and repair in the human genome at an unprecedented
level of detail regarding genomic damage formed endogenously and by environmental carcinogens and
anticancer drugs. Ultimately, this knowledge has the potential to improve the prevention strategies for
environmental carcinogenesis and to lead to the development of new tools for diagnosing and treating cancer."
10862665,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal is to discover how ongoing chromosome missegregation events in cancer cells (a
process called chromosomal instability, or CIN) alters the tumor ecosystem to promote cancer progression.
Chromosome copy number alterations (also referred to as aneuploidy) have long been associated with immune
suppressive phenotypes, drug resistance, and metastasis. Beyond aneuploidy, however, it remains unknown
whether the ongoing process of chromosome missegregation gives rise to tumor progression. Harnessing ex-
perimental tools that enable us to dial-up or dial-down chromosome missegregation rates in otherwise isogenic
backgrounds, we have previously found that ongoing chromosome missegregation generates rupture-prone mi-
cronuclei, which expose genomic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to the cytosol, leading to persistent activation
of the cGAS-STING innate immune pathway (1). Yet, instead of promoting a robust type I interferon (IFN) re-
sponse, STING activation in cancer cells with CIN promotes noncanonical NF-kB (nc-NF-kB) signaling – through
an unknown mechanism – to drive metastasis. The extent to which CIN-driven metastasis is dependent on the
immune system remains unknown. We made the surprising observation that CIN drives tumor progression in a
cancer cell non-autonomous manner by shaping the interaction between cancer cells and the tumor microenvi-
ronment (TME). This finding motivated the development of a fundamentally new, systems-level approach to
evaluate the nature and conditional-dependence of cell-cell interactions in the TME called ContactTracing. This
method exploits intrinsic biological variance captured by single cell RNA sequencing technologies, to infer cellu-
lar responses to ligand-receptor mediated interactions without prior knowledge of downstream target genes.
Combining this innovative computational tool with genetic perturbation of CIN and STING we found that CIN
engenders a pro-metastatic TME by inducing a cancer cell-intrinsic ER-stress response. In Aim 1, we propose
to mechanistically dissect the epistatic relationship between CIN, STING, and ER-stress in the progression of
triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) to determine whether ER-stress can represent a therapeutic target in chro-
mosomally unstable tumors. We will also test whether an ER-stress response underlies nc-NF-kB activation.
Under Aim 2, we will improve causal inference of tumor-derived ligand effects and explore their molecular basis
using gene regulatory networks to ask whether CIN-dependent cell-cell interaction networks are conserved
across cancer types using both human data and mouse models of breast, pancreatic, and lung cancers. The
amalgamation of these approaches, combined with our deep understanding of CIN in cancer, is poised to eluci-
date the complex roles of CIN-induced STING signaling on tumor-immune crosstalk during disease progression.
Importantly, this work is poised to reveal novel strategies aimed at targeting chromosomally unstable tumors,
which are otherwise difficult to treat."
10833634,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent cancer worldwide, killing over 850,000 people every year,
50,000 of these in the US. Only a handful of small molecule drugs are approved for patient treatment. Small
molecule drugs are often easy to formulate and more convenient for patients than antibody-based drugs, and
combination therapies have proved quite effective – FOLFOX (folinic acid, 5FU and oxaliplatin) being the prime
example in CRC. A recent study evaluated 2,025 clinically-relevant two-drug combinations on 125 tumor cell
lines representing breast, colon and pancreas and noted that “synergy overall was rare…” We wondered whether
this lack of drug-drug interaction might be a product of the simple and non-physiologic setting in which these
tumor cells were grown – monolayer cultures on tissue culture plastic – and whether a more physiologic setting
of 3-dimensional culture in the presence of a complex stroma might yield a different result. Our guiding
hypothesis for this study, therefore, is that a more complex and physiological model of human tumors will reveal
potentially clinically-relevant drug synergies.
In this study we propose to use our well-characterized human cell-based Vascularized Micro-Tumor (VMT) model
to test multiple drug combinations for potential synergies on colon cancer cells (both lines and patient-derived),
exploring the idea that drugs may target pathways and combinations of pathways that are not necessarily active
in 2D cultures, or may target tumor-stroma interactions that are just not present in monocultures. Indeed, we
have already identified a drug that blocks tumor growth only in the VMT, and not in monolayer culture or in
spheroids. The VMT platform comprises perfused living capillary beds in vitro that supply nutrients to the
surrounding tissue in much the same way they do in vivo. Microtumors, comprised of tumor cells and stromal
cells, embedded in extracellular matrix (ECM) are grown in the tissue chambers and these are surrounded and
penetrated by the micro-vessels, which support their growth. This is a flexible and powerful platform, and one
that is ideal for studying tumor biology, where remodeling of the vascular and stromal components is key to
tumor progression.
Our hypothesis is that: the VMT platform can reveal positive drug interactions not seen in simple 2D,
monocultures. To test this hypothesis we will challenge five tumor lines, representing the 5 CRIS categories of
colon cancer, against 25 drugs, representing most of the major signaling pathways, in all pairwise combinations.
We will then repeat this study with 5 patient-derived tumor lines. Our Aims are: 1. Establish dose-response
curves for each drug in the VMT. 2. Test all 2-way combinations of drugs in the VMT. 3. Compare drug
responses in tumor lines versus patient-derived tumors in the VMT."
10878997,"The luminal surface of each epithelial cell is covered by several thousand bristles, known individually as a microvillus and collectively as the brush border. The brush border promotes efficient digestion and absorption of nutrients by increasing intestinal surface area and by acting as a scaffold for enzymes, transporters, and host defense factors. Our proposal is significant because few studies address how microvillus structures are regulated in homeostasis or intestinal disease, despite the critical importance of the intestinal brush border to normal intestinal physiology. Monogenetic diseases with disruption of the brush border present with severe diarrhea and intestinal pathology. We have reported that abnormally short ileal microvillus length is present in a subset of histologically uninflamed Crohn’s disease (CD) ileal tissue samples. This phenotype identifies CD patients at-risk for treatment-refractory disease and future development of strictures, features associated with poor clinical outcome in CD. The major objective of this application is to define mechanisms that regulate microvillus length and brush border maturation. This knowledge could help us understand how to reverse pathological changes that occur at the brush border in Crohn’s disease and other pathologic conditions of the intestine. The key preliminary data supporting this application include 1) high fat diet feeding or acute loss of Ppara in intestinal epithelial cells of mice results in short microvillus length; 2) overexpression of Ppara in intestinal epithelial cells rescues high fat diet-induced microvillus shortening; 3) experimental injury of the duodenum or distal colon of mice cause microvillus length shortening in the ileum; and 4) altered brush border ultrastructure and protein expression are observed in Crohn’s disease vs. control patient ileal biopsy tissues. Our central hypothesis is that microvillus length and brush border maturity are suppressed following high fat diet or intestinal injury and can be restored by PPARα signaling activation within intestinal epithelial cells. In Aim 1, we will determine how high fat diet and intestinal epithelial PPARα signaling alter brush border morphology, ultrastructure, and protein expression using novel conditional mouse models with Ppara gain-of-function or loss-of-function specifically in the intestinal epithelium and air-liquid interface epithelial monolayer cultures. We will also use untargeted and targeted approaches to investigate the cellular mechanisms linking microvillus length changes to PPARα signaling. In Aim 2, we will use Ppara conditional mice to determine if intestinal epithelial PPARα signaling influences inflammatory and tissue injury outcomes and injury-associated ileal brush border changes. We anticipate that completion of the proposed studies will produce the following deliverable: identification of a biological pathway and cellular mechanism that integrates host and environmental influences to modify intestinal brush border morphology and function."
10854813,"Small molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists (“gepants”) and anti-CGRP or anti-
CGRP-receptor monoclonal antibodies (“nezumabs”) are novel treatments for migraine. However, endogenous
CGRP is among the most potent vasodilator molecules, and CGRP-mediated vasodilation is a critical rescue
mechanism in cerebral ischemia. Therefore, CGRP antagonism may increase cerebrovascular event risk in
migraineurs. Despite this obvious concern, the magnitude of unmet need in the migraine field has propelled the
clinical development of CGRP antagonists despite case reports of vascular complications.
We recently reported that gepants worsen the outcome after brief middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
mimicking transient ischemic attack in mice (Mulder et al. Ann Neurol, 2020). Gepant arm was significantly more
likely to develop infarcts compared with controls. Upon longer MCAO, infarct volumes, neurological deficits and
mortality were also higher in the gepant arm. Worse cerebral blood flow (CBF) deficits during MCAO implicated
impaired collateral function. These data strongly suggest that CGRP antagonists might exacerbate coincidental
or superimposed ischemic events, especially in migraineurs on chronic prophylaxis. Therefore, our overarching
goal is to define the cerebrovascular safety of CGRP antagonism and refine the target population to mitigate the
risk. To this end, we propose to examine the risk increment with CGRP antagonism in focal cerebral ischemia in
the absence (Aim 1) or presence of vascular risk factors (Aim 2), and elucidate the mechanisms (Aim 3).
Aim 1 will test whether a gepant and an anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody worsen focal cerebral ischemic
outcomes after various durations of MCAO in mice. We will establish the dose-response, the duration of effect,
and the effect of prolonged CGRP antagonism. Aim 2 will test whether comorbid vascular risk factors (aging,
diabetes, hypertension, migraine with aura) exacerbate the risk of CGRP antagonism. We will also determine
blood-brain barrier penetration of the anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody. Aim 3 will test whether CGRP antagonism
impairs cerebral collaterals and pial and penetrating arterial function, in vivo, using cutting-edge optical imaging
tools (laser speckle flowmetry, dynamic light scattering optical coherence tomography, two-photon microscopy).
All experiments will use both males and females with particular emphasis on rigor and reproducibility.
Millions of migraineurs are soon going to be receiving CGRP antagonists. It is imperative to better understand
the cerebrovascular risk associated with this class of drugs in an objective, bias-free manner. This is a mission
unlikely to be carried out or funded by the industry and should be trusted into the hands of NIH-funded labs with
no conflict of interest. Our laboratory has a long track record in both migraine and stroke. The investigative team
includes experts in MRI, optical imaging and migraine pathophysiology and therapies. All proposed methods are
in daily use. Therefore, we believe we are uniquely positioned to address this urgent unmet need."
10876347,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Current estimates suggest that in North America over 7% of women use cannabis during pregnancy and this
use is increasing as legalization becomes more common. Despite the high prevalence of prenatal cannabis
exposure, its effects on early brain and behavioral development remain poorly characterized, leaving some with
the impression that this exposure is benign or potentially even beneficial (e.g., to treat nausea during pregnancy).
Prior neurodevelopmental research on prenatal cannabis effects have had been important limitations including
few if any brain/behavioral assessments during first two years of life (a period critical to neurodevelopment), poor
characterization of the post-natal environment, and limited assessments of pre- and post-natal maternal mood
and anxiety, thus confounding interpretation of prenatal cannabis effects. In our study, we will enroll pregnant
women with (n=300) and without a history (n=150) of cannabis use during the first trimester gestation and follow
their offspring for the first two years of life with a focus on the neurodevelopment of executive functions. First,
we will characterize prenatal cannabis use through pregnancy with self-report measures and biospecimens.
Second, we will obtain third trimester fetal MRI scans to character offspring brain structure and function free of
post-natal confounds. Third, we will assess offspring cognitive and behavioral development over the first two
years of life with parent-report and laboratory-based behavioral assessments. Our design considers critical
confounds including parent-infant interactions, pre- and postnatal maternal mood and anxiety symptoms, shared
genetic liability, and concomitant drug use during pregnancy. Given the lack of clarity on the safety of cannabis
use during pregnancy, findings from this study will have important public health implications by informing
prevention messaging and strategies particularly in this era of increasing cannabis use."
10875515,"The mammalian retina contains at least 40 types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) each tuned to respond best
to different and sometimes complex features in a visual scene. Together, these diverse RGC responses
provide us with all of the information that we use to navigate in the visual world. Each type of RGC monitors a
patch on the retinal surface, its receptive field, by collecting inputs from presynaptic bipolar and amacrine cells
of which there are more than 12 and 50 types, respectively. While the general patterns of amacrine and
bipolar cell connectivity that contribute to RGC light responses are known, the daunting complexity of the inner
synaptic layer of the retina has impeded our understanding of the connections that underlie the tuning
properties that distinguish the RGC types. Specifically, there is currently no systematic way to identify all of the
cells that make presynaptic inputs to an RGC and at the same time study their combined function as a
processing unit. This proposal uses a toolbox of viral techniques to trace and functionally characterize the
amacrine and bipolar cells that provide input to specific RGCs in both the rod dominant mouse and cone
dominant ground squirrel retinas. In three specific aims, our goals are to: 1) use a trans-synaptic rabies virus
that expresses GFP to map the direct bipolar and amacrine cell inputs to genetically targeted RGCs in the
mouse retina; 2) use a trans-synaptic rabies virus that expresses the Ca2+ indicator protein GCaMP6 to study
the functional connections between RGCs and their direct inputs from bipolar and amacrine cells in the mouse
retina; and, 3) identify and functionally characterize the inner retinal circuits responsible for blue/green color
opponent vision in the ground squirrel. Our work will define the wiring and functions of specific inner retinal
circuits in health and provide the background for understanding circuit changes that are known to occur
following photoreceptor degeneration, whether from genetic or age-onset disease."
10890800,"Project Summary: The US is experiencing an opioid crisis, with an estimated 2.5 million Americans meeting
full criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) like buprenorphine are
currently the most effective form of intervention for OUD. In spite of the proven efficacy of MOUD, nearly half of
people who begin a MOUD relapse within six months. As such, novel and efficacious behavioral adjuncts to
MOUD are needed to improve treatment outcomes. Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), a
cognitive-affective training intervention generated through a NIDA-funded treatment development process has
shown significant promise, demonstrating therapeutic effects in four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by
reducing opioid use and misuse and modulating neurophysiological responses during drug cue-reactivity and
natural reward processing. However, the MORE intervention requires significant human interaction and is
therefore resource intensive. Further, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, people with OUD may be reticent to
engage in face-to-face interventions due to the risk of viral spread. To overcome these implementation barriers
and increase access to treatment, the proposed project will develop and test a virtual reality version of the
MORE intervention (MORE-VR) built on BehaVR LLC's VR existing, commercially available platform, the
Dynamic eXperience Engine (DXE). The DXE uses machine learning to integrate biometrics into the VR
experience to personalize addictions treatment, boosting patient engagement and optimizing the efficacy of
clinical intervention. In Phase I, we will develop and test the MORE-VR prototype in a single arm clinical study
of OUD patients receiving buprenorphine in an opioid treatment program (OTP), focusing on patient safety and
engagement. If the prototype is perceived to have adequate usability and Net Promoter Scores, as well as to
produce improvements in proximal measures of craving and affective state, the project will progress to Phase
II. In Phase II, we will first develop the MORE-VR Minimal Viable Program using feedback from our Phase I
study to optimize the intervention, and then conduct a RCT of MORE-VR vs. MOUD treatment as usual. Our
robust and unbiased research design will triangulate clinical outcome measurement with biochemical
verification of abstinence, ecological momentary assessments (EMA), and neurophysiological assessment of
cue-reactivity. Further, we will integrate the MORE-VR Program into the OTP operational environment, building
Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources interfaces to ingest patient data from electronic medical records
(EMRs) and to export patient utilization, assessment, and biometric data back to EMRs to create patient
records and inform clinicians of patient progress. Activities in Phase I and Phase II will help define the
regulatory pathway and establish regulatory feasibility to precede Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approval of the MORE-VR system as a Class II medical device. In sum, this project will translate an evidence-
based biobehavioral treatment approach into an innovative digital therapeutic for OUD."
10897304,"Epilepsy is a devastating disease affecting over 50 million people worldwide (WHO). About 30% of patients do
not respond positively to medication and are diagnosed as having drug resistant epilepsy (DRE). DRE causes
significant costs, morbidity, and mortality. The most effective treatment is to surgically remove the seizure onset
zone (SOZ), the region from which seizure activity is triggered. The localization of the SOZ is essential for
surgical success. Unfortunately, surgical success rates range from 30%-70% because there is no reliable
biomarker of the SOZ. We propose to develop a combined intracranial EEG-fMRI biomarker of the SOZ while
the patient is not seizing or at “rest”. One may ask, “how does one identify where seizures start in the brain
without ever observing a seizure, and if this is possible why have previous methods failed?” The fundamental
limitation of current computational approaches for both resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and intracranial EEG (rsiEEG)
SOZ localization lies in the fact that they compute static measures from observations produced by a
dynamic epileptic network. We believe that a computational method that can provide a characterization of how
the observations are dynamically generated in the first place, and how internal network properties can trigger
seizures or prevent seizures will be successful in SOZ localization. Therefore, we will construct dynamical
network models (DNMs) in this study. DNMs are generative models that capture how every network node
(location of centralized network signal processing and transfer) interacts with every other node dynamically.
DNMs uncover internal properties including bandwidth, stability, controllability, system gain, and most important
to this application - connectivity. We propose that when a patient is not having a seizure, it is because the SOZ
is being inhibited by neighboring nodes (brain regions). We thus will apply DNM algorithms in a novel manner to
identify two groups of network nodes from rs-fMRI and rs-iEEG: those that are continuously inhibiting a set of
their neighboring nodes (denoted as “sources”) and the inhibited nodes themselves (denoted as “sinks”). Thus,
in line with the most recent advancement in precision medicine, for each patient, we will build DNMs customized
to identify and quantify, via a score, key sources and sinks, optimized to localize the primary causative SOZ
nodes in the epileptogenic network and their connectivity properties. We will leverage functional imaging data
while patients are “at rest” in a study population of children with DRE who are undergoing epilepsy surgery
evaluation. Specifically, we will construct DNMs from rs-fMRI and rs-iEEG data and test our novel “source-sink”
hypothesis that may point to the SOZ when patients are not seizing. If successful, the proposed DNMs could
significantly increase surgical candidacy and improve surgical outcomes by increasing the yield of surgically
actionable results and precision of SOZ localization. Furthermore, by removing the need to capture seizures,
this novel dynamic network model-based SOZ localization biomarker may substantially reduce invasive
monitoring times, avoiding further risks to patients and reducing costs to hospitals."

Precision genomic medicine depends on a complete understanding of all forms of genetic variation in normal
individuals. However, current approaches for studying genetic variation in humans have yielded an incomplete
snapshot of somatic variation and its contribution to health and disease, as current approaches typically
sequence a single tissue (blood) and are not well suited for identifying structural variants, variants in repeat
elements, or the functional consequences of somatic variants. The goal of our proposal “Mosaicism in Human
Tissues, from Telomere to Telomere” is to characterize multiple types of human somatic variation across the
entire human genome in a set of 10 tissues from 50 donors, and to work with other SMaHT network members
towards producing a framework for understanding somatic variation in non-pathological human tissues.
To advance these goals, our GCC will use a highly successful pipeline that has produced tens of thousands of
high-quality human genomes, including the first ever complete telomere-to-telomere human genome. We will
produce high quality short and long-read DNA sequencing data, full length transcript RNA sequencing data,
single-molecule chromatin profiling data, and long-range chromatin conformation data from each donor.
This approach will enable us to generate donor-specific reference genome assemblies, which we will use to
call somatic variants in their originating haplotype genomic context. Calling variants independent of
traditionally incomplete human references will vastly improve our ability to accurately identify somatic variants
in complex repeat regions and other “unmappable” areas. These regions are precisely the locations where
somatic mutation rate is expected to be elevated because they are challenging for the cell’s endogenous
replication and proofreading mechanisms. Additionally, our approach will enable us to directly interrogate the
impact of identified somatic variants on overlying epigenetic and transcriptional gene regulatory patterns.
This GCC brings together three internationally recognized Principal Investigators (Drs. Bennett, Eichler, and
Stergachis), with decades of expertise in high-throughput genomics, somatic variant discovery, structural
variant identification, long-read sequencing and chromatin biology. Along with other members of the SMaHT
network, we will produce the most complete catalogue of somatic variation and its gene regulatory impact to-
date."

Over 42% of adults have obesity, which is more prevalent in under-represented minority (URM) populations.
While even modest (3-5%) weight loss improves this risk, Black and Hispanic patients are less likely to lose
weight in intervention programs, and we and others have found that Black patients lose less weight with
bariatric surgery. To address these disparities and promote health equity, the focus of my patient-oriented
research has been to develop and test weight management interventions in underserved patient populations. I
am currently PI on 4 behavioral clinical trials funded through the NIH and Veterans affairs and one longitudinal
bariatric surgery cohort study. These studies, with approximately 1700 patients enrolled thus far, have
supported the training of several students, post-doctoral fellows and junior faculty.
I have been passionate about mentoring trainees, especially those from URM populations. NYU Langone
Health provides a rich training environment for mentees at all levels to advance their research careers. This
K24 award will provide me with additional resources and protected time to increase the impact of my trainees’
and my research. With collaboration and guidance from my K24 Advisory Committee and Community Advisory
Board (CAB) members, the K24 will support the following Short-Term Career Objectives 1) To be a primary
mentor for 1-2 additional URM junior faculty or fellows per year; 2) To improve my skills in mentoring URM
trainees; 3) To increase my expertise and mentorship in social determinants of health (SDOH), health equity,
and community engagement; 4) To develop leadership skills in health equity; and 5) To obtain 2 additional
R01-level or higher grants to test and implement interventions addressing obesity-related health disparities.
Through formal coursework, conferences, and hands-on experiential training, I will enhance my skills and
expertise in leadership and mentorship in health equity, social determinants of health, and community-engaged
research. The K24 advisory committee, consisting of senior leaders and collaborators in these areas, will
advise on my research and training aims and will review a yearly formal evaluation of my mentoring.
My mentees and I are interested in how individual and neighborhood level markers of race and weight
discrimination impact weight management outcomes in vulnerable populations. For our research aims, we will
use existing datasets (n=768) participants in health coaching weight management intervention studies and 207
participants in a bariatric surgery cohort study to evaluate the impact of neighborhood- and individual- level
SDOH (including markers of discrimination) on weight management outcomes. We will engage relevant
patient and community stakeholders to collaborate on all aspects of the research. The research aims were
developed through extensive discussions with each of my current mentees to enhance their training, support
their individual research and improve the care of vulnerable patients with obesity."
10893987,"Mechanistic insight into oxidative stress-mediated genome instability
Summary:
Genome instability is characterized by genetic alterations ranging from DNA base mutations to chromosome
rearrangements that are drivers of many inherited human diseases, various types of cancer and premature
ageing. Chromosome instability, especially, results from inaccurate chromosomal segregation caused by
telomere and centromere dysfunction. Numerous epidemiologic studies have highlighted the central role of
oxidative stress exposures in the occurrence of telomere and centromere dysfunction. Critically, however, the
mechanisms underlying the dysfunction are not clearly understood. Oxidative stress results from an imbalance
between the production of reactive oxygen species and cellular antioxidant defenses. It arises from endogenous
sources as well as from environmental sources (mitochondria metabolism, UV light, air pollution, cigarette
smoke). Its ubiquity highlights the importance of properly understanding its impacts on human health. A major
impact of oxidative stress is the induction of oxidative DNA damage that are repaired by the base excision repair
(BER) pathway in which poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are major actors. PARP1 and PARP2 are
responsible for the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, a post-translational modification of proteins that modulates the
recruitment and interactions of their protein targets. The goals of this proposal are to (i) uncover the mechanisms
of oxidative stress-mediated genome instability with a focus on its impact on telomeres and centromeres, two
genomic loci crucial for genome stability and (ii) decipher the contribution of PARP enzymes in the protection of
telomeric and centromeric DNA upon oxidative DNA damage. More specifically, we aim to evaluate the impact
of chronic induction of oxidized DNA bases and BER single strand break intermediates on centromere and
telomere integrity. We will also identify and assess the impact of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation on centromeric and
telomeric protein targets. To this end, we will leverage a unique and innovative chemoptogenetic tool that induces
oxidative DNA damage locally at telomeres and at centromeres without impacting the rest of the genome. This
will allow us to unequivocally link phenotypic changes and PARP dependent mechanisms to the telomeric or
centromeric lesions. These projects will fill a long-standing gap of knowledge on how poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation
orchestrates DNA repair at two crucial regions of the genome. They will also shed light on how oxidative stress,
a ubiquitous factor of genome instability, can drive numerous human diseases. Ultimately, our work will
contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting specific regions of the genome and inform
the rational design and use of the PARP inhibitors already widely used in cancer treatments."
10878801,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Myocardial infarction (MI) is the most common cause of heart failure (HF), but the molecular mechanisms
underlying cardiac dysfunction in the post-MI myocardium remain unclear. Moreover, current treatments for HF
mainly focus on symptom management after maladaptive ventricular remodeling has occurred. However, a
comprehensive understanding of molecular changes at the early-phase (adaptive) remodeling could aid in the
development of treatments to prevent late-phase (maladaptive) remodeling and HF. Ventricular remodeling is
characterized by alterations in the sarcomere composed of myofilaments flanked by Z-discs. The post-
translational modifications (PTMs) of the sarcomeric proteins regulate contractility. Moreover, cardiac contractility
highly depends on ATP generation and thus impairment in the ATP-generating processes can rapidly lead to
contractile dysfunction. The onset of ischemia is known to be associated with dramatic alterations in cardiac
metabolism. PTMs of metabolic enzymes play a key role in regulating the metabolic pathways. Therefore, we
hypothesize that concerted dysregulations of sarcomeric and metabolic protein modifications contribute to
contractile dysfunction at the early-phase post-MI ventricular remodeling. To test our hypothesis, we will employ
a novel systems biology approach enabled by multi-omics integrating top-down proteomics and metabolomics
with in vivo and ex vivo functional studies to delineate the molecular mechanism underlying early-phase post-MI
ventricular remodeling. This novel multi-omics method allows accurate assessment of changes in the proteome
and metabolome from the same heart tissue sample to understand the concerted dysregulation of sarcomeric
and metabolic PTMs and metabolites. Moreover, we will use a combination of a large animal (swine) MI model
and clinical ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) tissues to accelerate translation of our findings to aid in diagnostic
and therapeutic interventions in humans. Aim 1 will identify concerted changes in the myofilament and Z-disc
proteins in post-MI swine myocardium and relate to contractile dysfunction in both sexes. Aim 2 will determine
the metabolic alterations in both proteome and metabolome in the post-MI remodeling. Aim 3 will identify
sarcomeric and metabolic markers in ICM patient myocardium and assess their functional consequences in
consideration of comorbidities and sex differences. This interdisciplinary and translational/clinical application
is highly significant with a strong scientific premise and a novel hypothesis of direct clinical relevance. It
will provide a comprehensive study to globally characterize a variety of PTMs in metabolic and sarcomeric
proteins as well as the interplay between dysregulation between cardiac metabolism and contractile dysfunction.
It has direct translational potential leading to an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms at the
early-phase post-MI remodeling and discovery of new sarcomeric and metabolic signatures as a panel of
markers for diagnosis of ICM at early-stage."

Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center (HGSC) will characterize variation in 750 tissue samples - 1/3
of the Program’s 15 samples from each of 150 individuals. Novel steps have been incorporated into our study
design to enable comprehensive discovery of somatic mutations. Both common core assay types (WGS
short-read, long read and bulk RNAseq) and two additional assays (nanoSeq and snRNAseq) that our group
specializes will be used for data generation. Benchmark standards, harmonized data structures and SOPs
will be created in collaboration with other Network members using established state-of-the-art methods for
discovery and orthogonal approaches for technical validation. New technologies that satisfy performance
criteria will be introduced into production. Statistical models will guide tissue-subsampling and sequencing
strategies, set the current thresholds with further room for improvement. NanoSeq and single nuclear RNA
procedures will each be modified for enhanced performance and close collaboration with investigators
developing additional tools will ensure optimal discovery. Local analyses will generate lists of putative
variants, with a particular focus upon characterization of long read sequence data. The latter will enable
modelling of transposition events, revealed within evidence for structural variation, as well as changes in
patterns of epigenetic marks. All data will be subjected to rigorous QA/QC, in collaboration with the DAC, and

This is an application for renewal of T32 DC000023, “Research Training in Hearing and Balance” to the
Center for Hearing and Balance (CHB) at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Pre-doctoral

Balance brings together expertise from across the Johns Hopkins University to inspire and promote
research into basic mechanisms of hearing and balance, pathogenesis and innovative therapeutic
strategies. While training opportunities are widespread and deep within each of the home

for trainees to advance their hearing and balance-related research goals. Research progress at all levels
from molecular genetic to public health depends on well-trained investigators who are knowledgeable
about hearing and balance from peripheral mechanisms to behavioral consequences. To accomplish
that goal, auditory and vestibular studies employ integrated knowledge from engineering, biology and
behavior. The training faculty of this T32 spans that wide range of knowledge and expertise and so
uniquely prepares pre- and postdoctoral trainees at Hopkins for this field. The inclusion of a strong

10896182,"On the sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis-Frontotemporal Dementia (sALS/FTD) clinical spectrum, the
aggregation and accumulation of disease-associated proteins such as TDP-43 is a notable neuropathological
hallmark, yet we know little about why this highly abnormal event might occur. Although disruptions in multiple
cellular processes have been implicated in ALS, 3 critical gaps in knowledge remain: 1) What triggers the
aggregation of wildtype proteins in sporadic disease? Is protein aggregation sufficient to drive pathology? 2)
What drives the cell-specific vulnerabilities and variable clinical manifestation from ALS to FTD? 3) How do
disease-associated alterations in protein homeostasis perturb communication in the tissue microenvironment?
Given that more than 95% of ALS arises sporadically, and that the mechanisms of sporadic disease remain
unknown, we will look beyond individual mutations, and establish a novel conceptual framework that examines
the cellular changes that occur during disease states. We posit that by focusing on why TDP-43 aggregation
occurs, especially in sporadic ALS, we will gain insights into pathogenic mechanisms underlying this
spectrum of disorders. Our central hypothesis is that there are physical changes at the cell and tissue
scale that initiate ALS/FTD. We propose that altered biophysical properties within cells (predominantly
altered molecular crowding), which are linked to mechanical perturbations to the tissue microenvironment
(stiffening, inflammation, edema causing osmotic stress), lead to age-dependent cellular dysfunction by
altering the dynamics of assembly, disassembly and transport of macromolecular protein machines. We will
test this hypothesis in cellular models, animal models, and patient tissue by (1) using novel tools to probe the
intracellular biophysical environment of cells; (2) integrating these findings using novel genomics technologies
applied to mouse models to study (i) how intracellular changes in crowding and extracellular changes in the
tissue microenvironment may drive pathogenesis in vivo, and (ii) how such perturbations disrupt cell-cell
communication in vulnerable regions of tissue; and (3) relating our findings to human disease by re-examining
these findings in the context of a clinically and neuropathologically deeply curated cohort of ALS/FTD patients.
 These studies will allow us to address the following questions: 1) Why does abnormal protein aggregation
and accumulation occur in sporadic disease, and how might this contribute to disease pathogenesis; 2) Do
these alterations in protein homeostasis perturb intercellular communication in the tissue microenvironment;
and 3) What drives the cell type vulnerability that makes ALS/FTD unique? The proposed work will accomplish
the following: A) represent the first detailed survey of molecular crowding in neural cells; B) uncover whether a
causal link between intracellular crowding, protein aggregation, and neurodegeneration exists, C) establish
whether the impacts of intracellular crowding show cell type specific signatures including changes in protein-
protein interactions, and D) provide a new framework to explore therapeutic strategies for treating ALS/FTD."
10909983,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT:
Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMSKP) is common in adolescents. Participation in regular physical activity (PA)
is effective in reducing CMSKP but PA participation is still below recommended levels. There is a need to better
understand ways to better promote PA in adolescent CMSKP (e.g., decreasing sedentary activity vs. increasing
moderate to vigorous PA), factors that affect PA (e.g., resilience, pain modulation, stress dysregulation), and the
mechanistic underpinnings of how these factors affect PA and pain. This knowledge may lead to the development
of improved interventions for CMSKP. Psychological resilience factors that build on positive attributes, such as
self-efficacy, motivation, and psychological flexibility may help adolescents to engage in PA. While resilience
factors are important for overall pain coping, they only recently are being considered as predictors for PA. The
overall goal of this proposal is to develop and pilot a feasibility study of an intervention that increases resilience
for PA in adolescents with CMSKP. This is significant because the development of such an intervention may
lead to improved PA and subsequently improved chronic pain for adolescents with CMSKP. This study first
evaluates pathways of resilience factors on PA and pain in adolescents with CMSKP (Aim 1), and the modulation
of pain and stress. 60 adolescents with CMSKP will complete self-report measures of resilience and vulnerability
factors, and objectively measured PA, pain (Quantitative Sensory Testing), and stress (Cortisol Awaking
Response). We will evaluate whether endogenous pain modulation and stress regulation mediate the
relationships between resilience and PA. This study also will consider resilience factors that are significant in
predicting less sedentary PA as intervention targets, and it will develop, refine (Aim 2) and (Aim 3) conduct a
pilot feasibility and acceptability study of a resilience-focused chronic pain intervention for youth (Pain REsilience
Promotion for Youth [PREP-Y]). The manual will be developed based on an established treatment program for
adolescent CMSKP in adolescents (i.e., FIT Teens) and modified to target resilience mechanisms and sedentary
activity. This will be done with integrated feedback from content experts in pediatric pain and CMSKP patients.
The intervention will then be provided to 30 patients in groups of 4 to 6. This project will be implemented as part
of a strong career development plan consisting coursework, experiential training, and intensive mentorship from
a team of experts in pediatric behavioral intervention development and evaluation, psychological factors of
pediatric pain, physical activity intervention, and pain physiology and assessment. Completion of this study will
occur across two academic medical centers with a joint department of pediatrics, a well-establish pain treatment
service, and research institutes to promote the growth and development of research faculty. This study and
career development plan will promote the establishment of independent, extramurally funded clinical-research
program focused on improving clinically meaningful outcomes for adolescents CMSKP."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) afflicts nearly a quarter of Americans and is projected to become the
leading cause of end-stage liver disease in the next decade. It is driven by overnutrition, disproportionately occurs
in men, and is linked to derangements in liver lipid and sterol metabolism. The molecular determinants that
control NAFLD and its sex-bias are incompletely understood. Using conditional genetic engineering, we have
identified a profound role for the transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) to direct sexually dimorphic
transcription in hepatocytes. Herein, we propose to comprehensively dissect the transcriptional regulatory
mechanisms of BCL6 underlying its sex-specific programming and the functional implications of hepatocyte Bcl6
on fatty liver disease and whole body metabolism. In Aim 1, we will test the impact of BCL6 on chromatin looping
and histone modification, its sex-specific modes of recruitment to chromatin, and coregulation with estrogen
receptor alpha. In Aim 2, we define the functional role of Bcl6 in the sexual dimorphism of NAFLD, its signaling
through bile acid pathways, and its impact on fibrosis using loss- and gain-of-function studies in vivo. Together,
these studies will reveal new molecular insights into the regulation of sexually dimorphic transcription and
NAFLD."

Targeted therapy for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has greatly improved patient outcomes
compared to traditional chemotherapy. However, it is estimated that up to 20% of lung cancer patients receive
first-line therapy prior to EGFR mutational analysis, necessitating the need for a rapid and cheap blood-based
circulating tumor (ct) DNA test for efficient therapy selection. Additionally, ctDNA can be useful for rebiopsy and
monitoring of response to therapy or acquired resistance to therapy. We have successfully developed a highly
multiplexable magneto-nanosensor assay for the detection of “hot spot” mutation panel for lung cancer [targeted
therapy selection or therapy monitoring and prognosis.]
Specific aims of the project are:
1) Validate ctDNA EGFR magneto-nanosensor assay accuracy and correlations to clinical outcome on expanded
cohort. We hypothesize that our magneto-nanosensor assay can detect “hot spot” EGFR mutations Exon19
deletion, L858R, and T790M with high sensitivity and specificity in a large cohort of NSCLC patients. Additionally,
this assay can be well suited for prognosis and therapy response monitoring. A follow-up blood draw 2 weeks
after initiating TKI therapy can be highly predictive of progression free survival. Additionally, we hypothesize that
frequent testing (every 2-3 months) on the magneto-nanosensor assay could be used in lieu of radiographic
imaging if patient maintains favorable response, and that the magneto-nanosensor assay could detect
progression of disease prior to imaging.
2) Develop an extensive ctDNA mutation panel assay on magneto-nanosensor arrays [for NSCLC treatment
selection, monitoring, and prognosis.] We hypothesize that our previously developed EGFR ctDNA magneto-
nanosensor mutation assay can be further expanded to include mutations relevant to third-generation TKI
resistance mechanisms and mutations in other genes to better aid in NSCLC [treatment selection, monitoring,
and prognosis.] In this aim, our goal is to develop a ctDNA mutation panel that can help identify treatment options
for NSCLC patients, not only EGFR mutations but also including KRAS, BRAF V600E, ALK-EML4 fusions, and
ROS1 fusions. [We aim to monitor patients throughout their treatment course for responsiveness and prognosis.]
The expected outcomes of this project are clinical validation of a ctDNA EGFR magneto-nanosensor assay,
expanding and multiplexing the existing EGFR assay to include KRAS, BRAF V600E, ALK-EML4 fusions, and
ROS1 fusions, and utilizing the assay [for efficient therapy selection, prognosis, and/or response monitoring.]"

Current treatments for addiction remain limited by a gap in the fundamental knowledge of how different regions
of prefrontal cortex interact in decision-making. Here, we examine the direct neural correlates in prefrontal
cortex of the control and costs of effortful decision making in humans at high spatiotemporal resolution, laying
the groundwork for the development of new treatments to improve decision making in addiction.
This K23 Career Development Award aims to provide me with the necessary training to become an
independent investigator translating intracranial studies of decision making into non-invasive biomarkers and
targets for neuromodulation in addiction. Toward this end, I propose the following training objectives: (1)
Develop advanced skills in neural decoding from intracranial electrophysiology data; (2) gain expertise in
designing neuroeconomic and computational psychiatry experiments; and (3) gain expertise in utilizing brain
stimulation in human behavioral experiments. The overall research objective of the proposed project is to
resolve the roles played by prefrontal regions during effortful decision making by combining a neural decoding
with functional connectivity analysis and with cortical stimulation to perturb network function.
The central hypothesis is that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) allocates cognitive resources for control, based
on the cost of control assessed in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), in turn determined by the efficiency evidence
accumulation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The specific aims of this research are to (1)
Dissociate the roles of three prefrontal regions in the regulation of cognitive control. (2) Map the
prefrontal network allocating cognitive effort, and (3) Causally dissect the cognitive effort network.
Innovation: (1) Method: Use of neural decoding, information theory with intracranial electrophysiology and
stimulation to characterize prefrontal networks in humans; (2) Design: Integration of experimental paradigms
from neuroeconomics with computational models of neural processing and neurophysiology; (3) Concept:
Measuring and modulating cognitive effort through simultaneous recording and stimulation of prefrontal regions
during effortful decision-making. The proposed research is significant because it resolves a controversy over
the functional roles of key regions of prefrontal cortex in effortful decision making that are putative targets for
neuromodulation in addiction. The new fundamental knowledge generated by this proposal will lay the
foundation for the development of novel biomarkers and targets for improving cognitive control and decision
making in addiction with mechanism-based computationally guided neuromodulation."

This program will train postdoctoral research scientists in immunological mechanisms related to development
and treatment of Autoimmune, Inflammatory, and Infectious Disease, and Cancer. The program at La Jolla
Institute for Immunology (LJI) will involve 20 faculty members from LJI whose expertise is in immune cell
function that relates to diseases such as diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, asthma,
atherosclerosis, atopic dermatitis, dengue, HIV, cytomegalovirus, tuberculosis, ebola, and immuno-oncology.
Each faculty mentor is internationally recognized in the field of immunology or immunological disease and each
has substantial peer-reviewed research experience and track records. The program will be open to PhD, MD,

will consist of a bench research laboratory experience of 12-24 months, under the close supervision of a
mentor or several mentors working on problems relevant to immunotherapy. The research backgrounds of the
faculty mentors are diverse, but with common themes centered on the biology of the primary cells of the
immune system, including T cells, B cells, NKT cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and others.
The training program will then represent an interdisciplinary approach where each trainee is exposed to cutting
edge and state-of-the-art immunological techniques and systems for making fundamental and translational
discoveries of the immune system. Our current and past trainees have excellent records of research
accomplishments. New trainees will be recruited nationwide and efforts will be made to recruit and retain
exceptional minority, women, and disadvantaged candidates. Trainees will be chosen on the basis of their prior
academic performance, research experience, publications, interviews, and recommendations from supervisors.
Trainees will participate in institutional seminars, journal clubs, courses, and immunology conferences
designed to expand the breadth of their understanding of immunology and immunological disease. All trainees
will be instructed in the principles of responsible conduct of research and scientific integrity. The goals of the
program are to foster the development of well-rounded immunologists who can fill much needed academic
positions, who can compete and be successful in obtaining independent research grants, and who can
contribute to biotechnology and pharmaceutical approaches, aimed at treatment of immune-related diseases."
10835107,"Abstract
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity produces calcium-rich excitatory currents that control the
physiology of central synapses. Ongoing excitatory transmission through NMDA receptors is essential for
moment by moment consciousness and cognition. In addition, permeating calcium drives long-term changes in
the strength of synapses to initiate learning and memory formation. Excessive NMDA receptor-mediated calcium
entry kills neurons and is a disease mechanism in stroke and age-related chronic pathologies such as
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Despite being sensitive to multiple small-molecule modulators, the potential of
NMDA receptors as therapeutic targets remains unrealized due to insufficient knowledge about the structural
changes that make their activation reaction. Moreover, recent advances in diagnosis with genetic sequencing
has identified a large number of unique variants in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Many of these
variants are causal to the disease, but the mechanism by which they affect the reaction mechanism, and
therefore function is unknown.
The overall objective of this research program is to describe the NMDA receptor activation, which consists of
stochastic transitions between closed, open, and desensitized states, with a level of detail that integrates atomic-
level structural information obtained from static receptor conformations with coarse-grained and atomistic
molecular dynamic simulations. These structural results will be tested with kinetic and thermodynamic
measurements of NMDA receptor current output.
At the completion of the proposed study, we will have identified atomic structures representative for each of the
three main functional states (closed, open, desensitized) and how these structures interconvert; will delineate
key atomic interactions that control these changes in structure; and will describe how the dynamic distribution of
receptors across this conformational landscape controls the patterns of depolarization and calcium influx
produced by NMDA receptors. Furthermore, we will then interrogate the resulting integrated mechanism to
examine how disease-related mutations and small-molecule modulators affect the conformational dynamics of
receptors and how they alter the NMDA receptor current.
The project will produce a congruent model that can be used to develop small-molecule modulators targeted to
specific receptor conformations that would reduce calcium flux independently of excitatory action, and will guide
therapeutic approaches for patients with dysfunctional NMDA receptor genetic variants."

Rotator cuff tears are common and primarily initiate at the stratified fibrocartilage interface (enthesis) linking
tendon to bone. Surgical reattachment of tendon to bone forms a narrow fibrovascular scar rather than
regenerates a continuous fibrocartilage enthesis. The resultant sharp boundary between mechanically
mismatched tendon and bone leads to strain concentrations and high rates of re-failure at the enthesis. The
objective of this proposal is to guide functional regeneration and repair of the structure, composition, and
mechanical performance of the injured tendon-to-bone enthesis using an innovative stratified biomaterial.
Intraoperative implantation of MSCs at the injury site during surgical repair is an attractive option to accelerate
enthesis regeneration. However it is essential to develop a biomaterial carrier to improve retention and
regenerative activity of bioactive MSCs across the injury site. We will evaluate the design of an innovative
stratified biomaterial to provide mechanical and trophic stimuli to promote MSC retention and enthesis
regeneration. We have generated rigorous proof-of-principle data for a collagen biomaterial that contains bone-
and tendon-mimetic scaffold compartments linked with a continuous hydrogel interface. We will show the
hydrogel interface inhibits strain concentrations that typically form between biomaterials with mismatched
mechanical properties under load. Further, the hydrogel interface provides a site to accelerate fibrocartilage-
like differentiation and remodeling in response to trophic factors produced in adjacent tendon- and bone-
mimetic scaffold compartments. Taken together, we hypothesize inclusion of a continuous hydrogel zone
linking tendon- and bone-specific scaffold compartments provides mechanical and trophic advantages to
accelerate regenerative potency versus monolithic and conventional stratified biomaterials. To address our
hypothesis we will first determine if and how a mechanically-optimized hydrogel insertion both increases
mechanical performance and supports fibrocartilage differentiation in vitro (Aim 1). We will subsequently
demonstrate trophic factors produced across the stratified biomaterial accelerate enthesis-specific MSC
differentiation and matrix remodeling in vitro (Aim 2). We will ultimately evaluate functional repair and
regeneration of the rat rotator cuff enthesis using an enthesis biomaterial-MSC construct in vivo (Aim 3). We
will use in vitro cyclic strain bioreactor studies to optimize MSC-biomaterial interactions, then a tiered set of in
vivo rat rotator cuff injury models to benchmark the quality and kinetics of enthesis regeneration via cellular,
tissue morphology, and mechanical metrics. This project will provide essential insight to aid clinical translation
of a biomaterial therapy to improve musculoskeletal enthesis regeneration."

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that is marked by sudden recurrent episodes of abnormal electrical activity in
the brain, known as seizures. This disease plagues more than 60 million people globally, with the same burden
of disease as breast cancer in women and lung cancer in men. First line of treatment for patients with epilepsy
are anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). If AEDs are not effective in suppressing seizures, then patients may consider
alternative treatments including surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone in the brain, electrical brain
stimulation, or vagus nerve stimulation. With several treatment options available, one may think that epilepsy is
under control. However, this is far from true. Accurately diagnosing epilepsy and then finding an effective
treatment can take years to a lifetime, during which patients and families suffer from the stigma of epilepsy, side-
effects of ineffective AEDs, extensive and costly hospital stays, poor outcomes of irreversible surgical treatment,
and/or less than satisfactory stimulation therapies whose efficacies are physiologically unmeasurable. We
propose a program to establish novel EEG biomarkers and computational tools that will enable rapid
and accurate diagnosis of epilepsy followed by a rapid path to an effective treatment. Such a program
entails major advances in conceptual knowledge of how epileptic cortical networks behave and change during
stimulation treatment that will be gleaned from dynamic network modeling (DNM) of EEG. There are many
challenges with diagnosing and treating epilepsy that unfolds as one considers the clinical workflow beginning
with a patient’s first seizure. First an accurate diagnosis of epilepsy can take months to years, where scalp EEG
can be leveraged to confirm diagnosis. However, the gold standard is to look for EEG abnormalities that are
indicators of epilepsy (e.g., spikes), which are often not captured or misread. Second, it takes months to years
to find effective AED treatment as there is no physiological measure of drug efficacy. For these two pain points,
we will leverage a new biomarker that our lab discovered from intracranial EEG called the source-sink metric
which is designed to capture pathological network properties that are always present only in epilepsy patients.
For 30% of the patient population, no AEDs work, and their alternative treatments include surgical treatment of
the epileptogenic zone (EZ) and electrical stimulation therapy. However surgical success rates for drug resistant
patients averages 50%, and there is currently no measure of efficacy of neurostimulation treatment, leaving half
of treated patients nonresponsive. For these drug resistant patients, we will leverage the source-sink index,
derived from DNMs and EEG, to help more accurately localize the EZ to improve surgical success rates, and to
track efficacy of stimulation treatment from the FDA approved RNS device. The proposed R35 will address major
challenges with novel EEG biomarkers stemming from dynamic network models. Is successful, the program will
lead to breakthrough technologies enabling getting to accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment for all epilepsy
patients more rapidly (from years to weeks), including the underserved drug-resistant cohort."

10907637,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Treatment of neurological disorders and psychiatric diseases, such as epilepsy, remains a big clinical
challenge in large populations of patients. A fundamentally more effective treatment method requires a
thorough understanding of the functional networks in the brain. This endeavor, however, critically relies on
the engineering success of building a deep brain interface that mimics brain complexity and is also compatible
with brain tissues. A key challenge in current neural interface devices is to map and modulate the brain
dynamics over a large volume in deep brain while providing a high spatiotemporal resolution and maintaining
minimal tissue damage. Our primary goal is to address this challenge by developing a spatially
expandable fiber-based neural probe as a multifunctional deep brain interface. The central hypotheses
in this project are: (1) The spatially expandable fiber-based probe arrays can provide a minimally invasive 3D
interface to achieve biomechanical and biochemical compatibility with brain tissue, as well as to enable large
volume stimulation and recording with a high spatiotemporal resolution; (2) The probe arrays allow for more
precise detection of seizure foci compared with existing methods, and enable real time suppression of seizure
activities by localized optogenetic and drug regulation. The specific aims of this project are: (1) Develop
spatially expanded fiber-based probe arrays for multifunctional in vivo neural interfacing; (2) Elucidate the
electrical recording, optical stimulation, and drug delivery performance of the probe arrays in vivo and the
tissue response of the probe arrays; (3) Demonstrate seizure foci detection and real-time seizure suppression
using localized drug and optogenetic intervention in deep brain. The hypotheses and aims will be tested using
a clinically relevant animal model of virus-induced seizure in mouse employing a combination of
electrophysiology, optogenetics, and focal drug delivery in vivo, as well as imaging and histology in brain
slices. This technology can provide a powerful tool for advancing the fundamental study of the microcircuitry
and functional networks in both animal and human brains. In the future, these studies have the potential to
elucidate novel ways to detect and treat neurological diseases at an early stage and more effectively
compared to other existing methods."

The number of bacterial strains resistant to clinically used antibiotics continues to increase at a frightening pace,
and the lack of viable first-line treatments of these bacterial infections has forced clinicians to consider second-
line antibiotic options such as polymyxins and aminoglycosides. Such reserve antibiotics often carry the risk of
significant toxicity and subsequent patient harm. Thus, the timely development of new antibacterial agents,
preferably with modes of action distinct from ones currently employed, is essential for the global decrease of
human morbidity and mortality. The chemical synthesis of known antibacterial natural products is a strategy that
has yielded great dividends in the past and continues to furnish important clinical therapeutics in the present.
Often, while entrenched in the construction of such complex molecules, the synthetic practitioner is confronted
by the limitations of available technology. Thus, the development of new organic methodology is often intimately
joined with the pursuit of biologically-active natural products. The overarching themes guiding this R35 proposal
are the development of new tethered aza-Wacker cyclization reactions and their use in the synthesis of
nitrogenous antibiotics. The importance of a tethered reaction is that it frees the synthetic practitioner from the
constraint of needing a pre-existing C–N bond in order to forge a new one, and our laboratory has published
several studies in this area. We plan to apply this technology for the synthesis of the unusual dichlorinated
polyketide antibiotics Bactobolins A-B and Acybolin A. Bactobolins A and B were first isolated from the culture
broth of Pseudomonas yoshidomiensis and have been demonstrated to have broad antibacterial activity against
a variety of pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Recent work has pinpointed the
antibacterial activity of Bactobolin A to inhibition of bacterial protein translation via binding to an unprecedented
site on the 50s prokaryotic subunit (L2); a crystal structure exists showing this interaction. Despite their rich
biological activity, there exists only one racemic synthesis (Weinreb) and one enantiospecific synthesis (Švenda)
of Bactobolin A. Acybolin A is a recently isolated antibiotic with activity against Bactobolin-resistant strains of B.
subtilis, suggesting a disparate mode of action from Bactobolins despite structural homology. There currently
exists no synthesis of the Acybolin family of natural products, no exploration of analogues, and limited analysis
of biological activity. A key step in our proposed synthesis of these compounds is a reaction recently developed
in our laboratory, the sulfamate aza-Wacker cyclization. The expected outcomes of this line of research include
the development of powerful new methods for the site-selective amination of alkene moieties and access to a
variety of new antibacterial compounds through precise stereocontrolled synthesis. Collectively, this work will
establish a broad and robust program of synthetic chemical innovation and antibiotic design in my laboratory."

 Parkinson's disease (PD) is diagnosed based on its characteristic motor symptoms of bradykinesia,
rigidity, and tremor. Increasingly, neuropsychiatric symptoms are identified as part of the neurodegenerative
process of PD. Cognitive impairment and psychosis increase as PD advances and are associated with increased
caregiver burden, impaired daily functioning and nursing home placement, dementia, and greater mortality.
Specifically, memory impairment and hallucinations occur in a subset of PD patients and are associated with an
increased risk for dementia and functional impairment. It is well established that the hippocampus is critically
important for memory function and hippocampal dysfunction has been shown to significantly contribute to
memory impairment in numerous human and animal studies. Similarly, it is now recognized that the hippocampus
plays an important role in the etiology of hallucinations across various psychotic disorders. However, the role of
hippocampal networks in the parallel clinical course of memory impairment and hallucinations in PD remains
unclear. The goal of this project is to assess whether hippocampal network dysfunction provides a shared
mechanism for memory impairment and hallucinations in PD and determine whether increased activity in specific
hippocampal subregions predicts greater cognitive and functional decline longitudinally.
 The current project aims to achieve these goals using detailed neuropsychological assessment and high-
resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods in PD patients with episodic memory
impairment, PD patients with hallucinations, PD patients without episodic memory impairment or hallucinations,
and healthy controls. A targeted fMRI activation task will be employed designed to tax hippocampal subregion
specific functioning. High-resolution resting-state fMRI will be used to assess connectivity changes between
hippocampal and cortical networks. Clinical and cognitive assessments will be repeated at a two-year follow up
to assess longitudinal change and predictive value of these fMRI markers in the progression of cognitive and
functional decline in PD.
 Together the proposed studies will provide insight into the role of the hippocampal network in memory
impairment and hallucinations in PD. The results will determine whether dysfunction in hippocampal subregions
is a marker of episodic memory impairment and hallucinations in PD patients and a predictor of increased risk
for future decline in this subset of patients. Finally, if successful, this work would additionally provide a target for
the development of new therapeutic interventions for memory impairment and hallucinations in PD."

 Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) is a Mg2+-dependent metalloenzyme responsible for
O-methylation of endogenous neurotransmitters, hormones, and xenobiotic substances that
possess a catechol functional group. Catecholamines are common neurotransmitters and
inhibition of COMT has emerged as a strategy for treating central and peripheral nervous system
disorders, such as Parkinson’s Disease, depression, cognition improvement, and others.
Similarly, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by impaired cognitive control, that is due,
in part, to dopamine regulation and signaling in the prefrontal cortex. Therefore, strategies that
refine dopamine activity in the brain could be used to reduce alcohol dependence and improve
cognition and decision-making associated with alcoholism. Indeed, tolcapone, a clinically
approved COMT inhibitor, has been successfully shown to significantly reduced alcohol
consumption. Despite these encouraging findings, tolcapone has many drawbacks, including
hepatoxicity, which limits its widespread use. This proposal will use metalloenzyme fragment-
based drug discovery (mFBDD) for developing COMT inhibitors that target the immutable active
site Mg2+ ion. Our program will overcome the dependence of all clinical COMT inhibitors (including
tolcapone) on the 3-nitrocatechol warhead. This effort will identify non-3-nitrocatechol warheads
for COMT inhibitors that will be evaluated in an animal model of AUD. Collectively, this program
will discovery best-in-class COMT inhibitors and demonstrate their utility as a novel therapeutic
approach against AUD."
10862583,"Project Summary
Breast cancer has been the most prevalent cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in
American women for many years. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting checkpoint proteins such as
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) resulted in durable clinical remissions in a subset of cancer patients,
including breast cancer. However, most patients didn’t show a response to ICI treatment, urging the need for
novel biomarkers that can predict patient response and therapeutic targets that can improve the efficacy and
durability of ICIs. The goal of this proposal is to investigate how to overcome the ICI resistance. My preliminary
data showed that interferon (IFN) -alpha and -gamma signaling are enriched in the tumor and blood neutrophils
of nonresponders to ICIs. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that tumor-educated neutrophils with
increased IFN signaling mediate breast cancer resistance to ICIs, and can be used as predictive biomarkers.
During the K99 phase, I will explore the impact of neutrophil-restricted IFN signaling on tumor response to ICIs
and characterize the neutrophil-specific interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signature (Aim 1). Since we found that
ISGs in peripheral blood neutrophils can predict breast cancer response to anti-PD1 therapy, I will determine if
blood neutrophil ISGs signature can serve as a biomarker in other cancer types and human patient samples
from the clinic and clinical trials (Aim 2, K99 and R00). Finally, I will study the neutrophil IFN signaling in regulating
immune memory and durable response to ICIs (Aim 3, R00). Upon successful completion of the Specific Aims,
this translational study will extend our knowledge of neutrophil IFN signaling and provide novel biomarkers for
the ICI therapy and therapeutic targets to overcome the ICI resistance.
My overall career goal is to establish an independent translational cancer research group that will improve
understanding of cancer development, identify novel effective therapies, and train the next generation of cancer
researchers. This proposed research in the K99 phase will take place in the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center
at Baylor College of Medicine, a highly collaborative and multidisciplinary environment with strong integration of
basic, translational, and clinical research. The institution is dedicated to the career development of postdoctoral
trainees, and provides a variety of training venues including bioinformatics and immunology, weekly seminars,
R&D workshops, journal clubs, and the annual retreat. BCM is part of the Texas Medical Center, the largest
medical city in the world consisting of over 60 medical institutions and hospitals, which offers me enormous
opportunities for training and collaboration. Finally, I will meet with Drs. Rosen and Zhang weekly to discuss my
projects besides our weekly lab meetings and have a formal committee meeting every three months to discuss
my progress and receive feedback. I am also supported by a patient advocate and other collaborators. Through
the training and research plan proposed within my K99/R00 application, I will acquire knowledge and skills which
will greatly improve my ability to launch my scientific career as an independent investigator."

 SARS-CoV-2, a betacoronavirus, is the etiologic agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In response,
worldwide efforts have led to the rapid development of multiple vaccine candidates that have shown efficacy in
controlled clinical trials and effectiveness in the general population. Despite these advances, viral variants of
concern (VOC) continue to emerge, while the pandemic potential of future coronavirus zoonotic spillovers
remains high. Thus, the overall aim of our research efforts is to guide pan-coronavirus vaccine research and the
provision of immunotherapeutic molecules with broad specificity for future pandemic prevention. To this end we
will interrogate VNAR nanobody repertoires cloned from nurse sharks that have received sequential
heterologous CoV spike ferritin nanoparticle (SpFN) immunizations, i.e., primed with SARS-CoV-2 SpFN, and
recalled with either SARS-CoV-1 SpFN or MERS-CoV SpFN, to identify broadly conserved, neutralizing
epitopes. Isolated nanobodies will be produced in recombinant form and evaluated for function and specificity
using binding, affinity, and competition mapping assays, followed by viral neutralization, and in vivo protection
studies. Based upon our preliminary studies we anticipate that we will find VNAR nanobodies that can target (i)
pan-sarbecovirus epitopes, (ii) pan-merbecovirus epitopes, and potentially (iii) pan-sarbecovirus-merbecovirus
epitopes. To explore this further we will undertake detailed structural biology studies of our current set of broadly
sarbecovirus-reactive VNARs as well as any newly identified VNARs. Using X-ray crystallography and Cryo-EM
imaging we will determine the binding epitope of each VNAR. This atomic level information will be used to map
cross-neutralizing CoV immune epitopes and provide information that can be used in the design of new
immunogens that will elicit pan-sarbecovirus and pan-merbecovirus protective immune responses.
 The proposed research is significant because it will provide unique information that can be used to guide
next generation immunogen design and vaccination strategies for protection against SARS-CoV-2 VOC and
future sarbecovirus and merbecovirus zoonotic spillover events. The novelties of our project are (1) the
immunization of nurse sharks with heterologous and highly immunogenic CoV SpFN molecules to elicit broadly
neutralizing antibody responses; (2) the use of structurally unique VNAR nanobodies to probe sites of
vulnerability on sarbecovirus and merbecovirus spike proteins; (3) utilization of a broad panel of sarbecovirus
and merbecovirus RBD molecules to assess the breadth of recognition for both binding and structural studies;
(4) the combination of cross-functional and long-standing expertise in shark immunology and VNAR
identification, vaccine design and structural biology, and small animal challenge studies."

The liver and kidney are the major organs where glucose biosynthesis is coupled to mitochondrial
metabolism. Previous studies demonstrate that overnutrition accelerates whole-body gluconeogenesis
(GNG) and citric acid cycle (CAC) activity in vivo. A limitation of prior research is that the unique
contributions of the liver and kidney to whole-body GNG and CAC fluxes have been difficult to disentangle
in vivo. The inability to discern hepatic from renal metabolic fluxes represents a significant gap in
knowledge, as obesity may not only cause an ectopic accumulation of lipid but also an “ectopic
redistribution” of gluconeogenic function that disproportionately stresses the kidney. We hypothesize that
renal GNG and CAC activity are disproportionately elevated in obesity, which contributes to the
dysregulation of whole-body glucose metabolism and promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative
tissue damage in the kidney. The scientific aims of this proposal are to (i) determine whether the
progressive development of obesity disproportionately impacts renal gluconeogenic and oxidative
metabolism, (ii) assess whether gluconeogenic overload on the kidney accelerates oxidative metabolism
and stress during obesity, and (iii) identify metabolic mechanism(s) by which SGLT2 inhibitor treatment
reduces hepato-renal lipotoxicity in vivo. The aims of our project will be accomplished using a novel,
metabolic flux modeling system that simultaneously determines gluconeogenic and oxidative metabolic
fluxes in the liver and kidney in vivo. This work is innovative because it examines the etiology and
treatment of metabolic disease through the lens of multi-organ fluxomics while focusing on an
understudied aspect of gluco(dys)regulation. It is significant because it will identify organ-specific
metabolic nodes that may be better targeted to improve glycemic control and reduce damage in the kidney
and liver. Results from this K01 project, the unique expertise of each member of my mentoring committee,
and the diabetes research infrastructure at Vanderbilt University will be leveraged to achieve my career
objective of an independent career studying metabolic regulation in diabetic kidney disease and
hypoglycemic counter-regulation. As such, this project integrates a career development plan with the
training needed to bolster my disease-state expertise, grantsmanship, and expand my analytical
capabilities to ensure a smooth transition toward research independence."
10881727,"Dental caries continues to be a public health issue, especially more evident in underserved 
populations throughout the U.S. Unfortunately, especially with an ageing population, hundreds of 
thousands of resin composite restorations are replaced each year due to recurring decay and 
fracture. According to a number of cohort studies, the average life-span of this type of 
restoration is 10 years or less, depending on the caries risk level of the patient and on the 
complexity of the restorative procedure. This proposal represents an effort to develop novel 
antimicrobial structures, based on a targeted approach specifically against dysbiotic biofilm.
Bacterial coalescence will be prevented by using GTF inhibitors, made polymerizable by 
functionalization with stable methacrylamides. In addition, MMP-inhibiting moieties will be added 
to a polymerizable monomer, improving the stability of the collagen in the hybrid layer.
Ultimately, this will save millions of dollars annually and the unnecessary loss of additional 
tooth structure that comes with every re-treatment. The proposed approach will improve the 
longevity of restorations by: 1. Designing monomers containing known GTF-inhibiting moieties, thus 
making them available non-transiently at the surface of restorations. 2.Utilizing polymerizable 
functionalities that depart from the water/esterase-labile methacrylates. Methacrylamides are well 
known for their resistance to degradation by hydrolysis, and the systems proposed here will also be 
stable to enzymatic attack. 3. Incorporating MMP-inhibiting moieties on the methacrylamide monomer 
to the used as the adhesive, thus preserving the integrity of the collagen long-term. 4. Testing 
the materials in a physiologically relevant environment, mimicking the conditions in the mouth in 
terms of mechanical loading, bacterial challenge and presence of saliva."

 Task-shared mental health interventions are effective in low- and middle-income countries, yet they remain
underutilized and the mental health treatment gap remains substantial. Innovative implementation strategies
are needed to successfully integrate evidence-based mental health treatments into medical care in LMICs.
 A common component of many implementation efforts is a “champion” strategy which identifies and
empowers an on-the-ground staff member as the implementation champion, in charge of focusing their
colleagues’ efforts on implementation of the evidence-based treatment model. Yet a growing body of research,
including our own work in Malawi and elsewhere, highlights that the champion’s success is strongly influenced
by the strength of support from their line manager and other up-the-chain organization leaders, who are critical
in aligning the organization’s climate and priorities in support of the implementation effort.
 Approaches to influencing leadership engagement to change organizational climate and align priorities has
been developed over decades in the field of organizational and industrial psychology but only relatively
recently applied to implementation science health research and primarily to implementation in high-income
countries. The Leadership and Organizational Change for Implementation (LOCI) is a recently developed
multi-level leadership coaching implementation strategy that has demonstrated effectiveness in changing
organizational climate, aligning priorities, and enhancing mental health treatment model integration in the US
and Norway, but has not been adapted to or tested in low-income country settings. LOCI has significant
potential to address the gaps identified in our current research by aligning leadership priorities to support
champions in advancing mental health integration.
 The objective of the present proposal is to test the impact and sustainability of supplementing the standard
champion implementation approach with the LOCI leadership alignment strategy to achieve successful
integration of an evidence-based, task-shared mental health treatment model into general medical care. We
will use a cluster-randomized trial to evaluate the impact of the adapted leadership alignment strategy on
integration of an evidence-based mental health treatment package into multiple medical care settings (NCD,
HIV, and TB care), assessing proximal (climate), primary implementation (adoption, reach, fidelity),
downstream patient mental health, and cost-effectiveness outcomes as well as sustainability after conclusion
of the leadership alignment activities. Additionally, we will use the structure of the research project to further
strengthen capacity among mental health researchers and policy makers in Malawi.
 Leadership alignment strategies are an understudied but essential ingredient for successful mental health
integration efforts. This project will make a major contribution to our understanding of the role of leadership
alignment in advancing evidence-based mental health integration in LMICs."
11006243,"[Due to the functional impairments caused by a lower limb amputation, it is essential to determine the
benefits of rehabilitation strategies such as real-time visual feedback training. Such training could allow
Veterans with transtibial amputations (TTAs) to better utilize their prostheses and regain the greatest possible
level of function. It is not clear how much the prosthetic device (passive-elastic prosthetic foot versus battery-
powered ankle-foot prosthesis) and/or the user’s response to the prosthesis contribute to the biomechanical
and metabolic effects of using these prostheses during walking. Better use of a prosthesis due to targeted real-
time visual feedback training could enhance rehabilitation, improve function and reduce asymmetric
biomechanics, which in turn could reduce common comorbidities such as osteoarthritis, leg and back pain, and
indirectly, diabetes in Veterans with TTAs. The purpose of the proposed project is to systematically establish
the metabolic and biomechanical effects of targeted real-time visual feedback training of peak propulsive
ground reaction force (GRF) on the biomechanics, metabolic costs, and muscle activity of Veterans with TTAs
using their own passive-elastic prosthetic foot and a battery-powered ankle-foot prosthesis. The results of our
research could enhance the use of prosthetic technology to improve the rehabilitation and function of Veterans
with lower limb amputations.
 Previous studies suggest that use of passive-elastic and/or powered ankle-foot prostheses may not
optimize the function of Veterans with TTAs during walking. Targeted, real-time visual feedback training of
peak propulsive ground reaction forces increased propulsion and improved walking function in older (>65
years) and post-stroke adults, who typically have impaired ankle power. To our knowledge, no research has
addressed how visual feedback of peak propulsive force affects the use of passive-elastic or powered ankle-
foot prostheses by people with TTAs. In the proposed research, we will determine the underlying metabolic
costs, biomechanics, stability, and muscle activity resulting from targeted real-time visual feedback training of
peak propulsive force to identify how Veterans with a TTA benefit from more effective use of a passive-elastic
prosthesis and/or a battery-powered ankle-foot prosthesis and to determine if the addition of mechanical power
provided by a battery-powered ankle-foot prosthesis can further enhance the function of Veterans with
unilateral TTAs during walking. 30 Veterans with unilateral TTAs will use their own passive-elastic prosthesis
both with and without visual feedback training during level-ground walking, while we measure their metabolic
costs and biomechanics. Then, they will use a powered ankle-foot prosthesis (emPOWER, BiONX, Ottobock)
both with and without visual feedback training during level-ground walking, while we measure their metabolic
costs and biomechanics. With each prosthesis, subjects will walk at 1.25 m/s on a dual-belt force-measuring
treadmill 1) with no visual feedback, and then with real-time visual feedback of: 2) peak propulsive force from
the “no feedback” condition, 3) +20% greater peak propulsive force, and 4) +40% greater peak propulsive
force. During these visual feedback trials, we will ask subjects to match the peak propulsive force displayed on
a computer screen with their affected leg. We will also ask subjects to: 5) match symmetric visual feedback of
the peak propulsive force from both legs. We will determine if Veterans with TTAs utilizing real-time visual
feedback training of peak propulsive force can improve metabolic costs, biomechanical symmetry, and
dynamic stability/balance, while using their own passive-elastic prosthesis or a powered ankle-foot prosthesis.
We will also establish if Veterans with TTAs can retain the metabolic and biomechanical benefits elicited by
real-time visual feedback training once that feedback is removed. Results from the proposed project will be
used to inform rehabilitation strategies and prosthetic design, which could ultimately improve health, maximize
function, and improve quality of life for Veterans with TTAs.]"

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative condition that it is estimated to affect 16 million
Americans by 2050. AD is mixed proteinopathies (e.g., amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation, tau neurofibrillary tangles,
and TDP-43 inclusions) and selectively affect certain regions of the brain (e.g., neocortex and hippocampus)
with complex pathophysiology.
and characterization of specific
Although multiple studies have focused on genetic factors for AD, the delineation
neuronal and glial cell populations with enriched vulnerability to proteinopathy in
AD remains unknown. Our team has demonstrated that single-cell/nucleus multi-omics (snRNA-seq/snATAC-
seq) can be used to investigate both “normal” and “pathological” neuronal and glial subpopulations from human
post-mortem brains and we have also established a large human brain biobank with diverse proteinopathies
(including Aβ, tau, TDP-43 and others). Moreover, we have demonstrated how targeting proteinopathy-specific
networks, such as acetylated Tau and synergistic proteinopathy networks shared by Tau and Aβ, can identify
repurposable treatments (e.g., sildenafil and diflunisal) for AD. Our preliminary snRNA-seq and snATACT-seq
analyses of human post-mortem cerebellum regions from 7 individuals (n=4 [AD] and n=3 other dementia cases)
have revealed unique neuronal and glial cell populations and genes/networks when comparing to traditional
snRNA-seq data from neocortex and hippocampus. Our integrative snRNA-seq data analysis has also identified
disease-relevant microglial subtypes, including microglia containing amyloid-b/phosphor-tau, as well as microglia
enriched in expression of pro-inflammatory markers, using deep generative models. We therefore hypothesize
that comprehensive characterization of human neuronal and glial cell genomic and epigenomic signatures and
networks that are vulnerable to proteinopathies will help to identify novel mechanistic pathways and disease-
modifying treatments. In Aim 1, we will generate comprehensive multi-ome data of human neuronal and glial
cells vulnerable to AD proteinopathies. We will use a sample pooling snRNA-seq/snATAC-seq technology to
analyze human post-mortem neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum with varying degrees of proteinopathy
severity (amyloid-b, p-tau and TDP-43) and age-, sex- and APOE-matched cognitive healthy controls available
from the Northwestern Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that neuronal
and/or glial cell-specific genomic/epigenomic signatures and networks identify the molecular mechanism(s) of
vulnerability and resilience in AD. These multimodal data analyses will integrate large snRNA-seq/snATAC-seq
profiles with existing whole genome-sequencing data from the Alzheimer’s disease sequencing project (ADSP).
In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that selective cellular vulnerability linked to genes/networks can be targeted
via pharmacologic treatment to slow progression of AD-like disease in animal models. Successful completion of
our project will identify new treatment opportunities that target specific neuronal and/or glial cell-specific
risk/resilience genes and networks that confer vulnerability to proteinopathies in AD and other dementias."

Bunyaviruses (Order: Bunyavirales) are a growing and diverse family of animal and human pathogens with
pandemic potential. With over 300 members and an expanding distribution of mosquito and tick vectors due to
climate change, these viruses are responsible for increasing outbreaks of human disease and present a
significant threat to human health. Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) is one of the well-studied bunyaviruses and is
designated as an NIAID Category A pathogen and included in the WHO’s Blueprint of Priority Diseases. The
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) included RVFV as part of their emerging infectious
diseases vaccine program, further emphasizing the potential impact on the global health and economy.
Oropouche virus (OROV) is found in South America and has caused more than 30 large epidemics resulting in
over 500,000 human cases, making it the second most common arboviral disease in South America behind
Dengue fever. However, the true case number is likely much higher due to Oropouche fever being misdiagnosed
as Chikungunya or Dengue. A third member, La Crosse virus (LACV) is found primarily in North America and is
the primary cause of pediatric viral encephalitis in the United States. Neither OROV nor LACV have been as well
studied as RVFV, and thus a significant gap remains in our broad understanding of bunyavirus pathogenesis.
Currently there are no approved therapeutic drugs for treatment of RVFV, OROV, or LACV disease, further
highlighting the need for our proposed studies. To address this need, we conducted a genomic screen that
defined several critical factors, including Lrp1, an LDL family member. In support we provide compelling
preliminary data including in vitro validation in Lrp1 sufficient and deficient cells, transcomplementation studies,
and direct interaction between RVFV glycoprotein Gn in vitro. We also show that inhibition of Lrp1 by endogenous
ligands in vitro in multiple cell lines from evolutionarily distinct hosts, and in vivo data demonstrating the
importance of Lrp1 for viral tropism and disease in mice. Here we will characterize the importance of Lrp1 for
entry of multiple bunyaviruses, define molecular mechanisms, and validate the significance in vitro and in vivo.
This work will be performed by highly productive and collaborative investigators with expertise in every aspect
of the proposed studies, including biochemistry, viral pathogenesis, immunology, proteomics, structural biology,
and virology. At completion, we expect to validate Lrp1 as pan-bunyavirus entry factor, filling a key gap in the
field and to provide novel targets for therapeutic development."

Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is the number one cause of death from long-term and excessive alcohol use
in the United States. One early and primary target of alcohol hepatotoxicity is the mitochondrion. Chronic alcohol
consumption severely compromises liver mitochondrial bioenergetic function; however, the specific molecular
mechanisms responsible for mitochondrial damage are not well understood. We also do not know the full
contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction in pathobiology of ALD. Accumulating evidence supports the concept
that an intrinsic biological mechanism known as the molecular circadian clock regulates how organs respond to
external environmental factors, as well as internal physiological stimuli and abnormal pathologic stresses. There
is a growing body of evidence that circadian rhythms are disrupted by chronic alcohol use, which likely contribute
to disease as genetic mutation or deletion of clock genes increase metabolic dysfunction and liver pathology in
alcohol models. Regarding this scientific premise, we discovered that chronic alcohol significantly deceases liver
clock amplitude and disrupts the timing of the liver clock. Alcohol-fed mice with liver-specific deletion of Bmal1
exhibit impaired glucose and glycogen metabolism rhythms, a dysregulated hepatic triglyceride lipidome, and a
greater liver disease pathology score compared to control genotype mice fed an alcohol diet. We also have
exciting new preliminary data showing chronic alcohol significantly dampens and disrupts rhythmicity of critical
hepatic mitochondrial bioenergetic functions, including activity of cytochrome c oxidase, the rate-limiting enzyme
of mitochondrial respiration. Building on these exciting new observations, we offer a new paradigm where loss
in circadian control of mitochondrial bioenergetic function during chronic alcohol consumption plays a key causal
role in the pathogenesis of ALD. We will test this hypothesis through three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will
establish that chronic alcohol consumption disrupts 24-h rhythms in hepatic mitochondrial bioenergetic function.
In Aim 2, we will define the roles of hepatocyte BMAL1 and E4BP4 in alcohol-induced mitochondrial bioenergetic
dysfunction and liver injury. In Aim 3, we will test if reinstating liver clock activity during alcohol use prevents
mitochondrial dysfunction and liver injury. These results will provide the first insights into the relationship between
the circadian system and alcohol on mitochondrial bioenergetics and organ damage. Project findings will have
direct translational impact by advancing pre-clinical scientific knowledge required for stimulating drug discovery
in the areas of mitochondrial and chronobiology based therapeutics for treating patients afflicted with ALD and
other serious liver diseases."
10880558,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 The nucleus-cytoplasm shuttling of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is a key determinant in the spatiotemporal
articulation of gene expression. This process is finely tuned by multiple factors, one of which is the addition of a
methyl moiety onto the adenosine base at the nitrogen-6 position (m6A). Emerging evidence suggests that
m6A enhances the nuclear export of decorated mRNAs. Current theories explaining m6A-assisted mRNA
export focus on the crosstalk between the protein enzymes involved in m6A modification and the typical RNA-
binding adaptor proteins that hand the mRNA cargoes over to the classical export receptors. In this study, we
have found a noncanonical transport axis for m6A-marked mRNAs.
 Our preliminary data have shown that METTL3, an integral subunit of the m6A methyltransferase complex,
directly interacts with NUP93, a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). RNA-binding capacity of
METTL3 helps link the m6A-modified mRNAs to NUP93 on the nuclear envelope, which accelerates the
passage of mRNA cargoes through the NPCs with the assistance of the principal export factor NXF1-NXT1.
Integrative analysis of the m6A profile and fractionation transcriptome has identified a large group of m6A-
harboring mRNAs whose nuclear export is dependent on the METTL3-NUP93 complex. Interestingly, these
mRNAs are distinguished from other transcripts, as they tend to have longer 3' untranslated regions (3'-UTR),
which is associated with more m6A sites and stronger methylation intensities. In addition, Gene Ontology
analysis has revealed important functions of these transcripts in cellular physiology. In this regard, we found
that the genetic mutations on NUP93, which have been reported to cause steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome
(SRNS) in humans, disrupts its interaction with METTL3, implying a potential association between
dysregulation of METTL3-NUP93 axis and development of certain pathological conditions. Being guided by
these preliminary data, we have developed biological systems to monitor the m6A status of test mRNA species
and will employ cutting-edge technologies, such as single-point edge-excitation subdiffraction microscopy and
epitranscriptome-editing tools, to define the role of METTL3-NUP93 axis in the nuclear export of m6A-
conjugated mRNAs. Our Specific Aims are: (1). To examine how the METTL3-NUP93 interaction facilitates the
nuclear export of m6A-marked mRNAs; (2). To determine which transcripts are specifically regulated by the
METTL3-NUP93 axis; (3). To elucidate why this new mRNA transport pathway is biologically important.
 Our proposed research will impact upon the fields of RNA biology and epigenetics. Findings from this
study will help delineate a novel mechanism of m6A-assisted mRNA export and offer new therapeutic targets
for certain human diseases, such as kidney abnormalities that are caused by NUP93 mutations."
10888315,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Women with HIV face particularly higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than uninfected women, potentially
related to lower levels of ovarian reserve and sex steroid hormones in women with HIV. Our preliminary findings
in women with HIV suggest that menopause alters the gut microbiome and microbial translocation, which may
contribute to CVD risk. Yet, no studies have investigated the association of menopause and sex hormones with
gut microbiome composition and microbial translocation, nor considered the impact on CVD risk. This is
particularly relevant in the context of HIV infection, where a dysbiotic gut microbiome and microbial translocation
are thought to lead to persistent immune dysregulation and increased risk of CVD and other chronic diseases.
Here, we explore the novel hypothesis that menopause and sex hormones influence CVD risk via modulation of
the gut microbiota and microbial translocation, particularly in HIV infection. Leveraging ongoing gut microbiome
and CVD projects in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), this project will: 1) investigate longitudinal
changes in the gut microbiome by menopausal status in women with and without HIV; 2) examine relationships
of sex steroid hormones with the gut microbiome and soluble CD14 (sCD14), a biomarker of microbial
translocation; and 3) examine the associations of menopause- and sex hormone-related gut
microbiome/microbial translocation features and subclinical CVD. These aims will utilize pre-existing data,
including comprehensive demographic and clinical data collected by the WIHS cohort, 16S rRNA gene
sequencing and shotgun sequencing data from stool samples, serum sCD14, and carotid plaque and intima-
media thickness data from B mode ultrasound. We additionally propose new measurement of 14 sex steroid
hormones in serum, including adrenal precursors, androgens, and estrogens, using gold standard mass
spectrometry assays, in 200 post-menopausal women. To facilitate my career development, I will also pursue
training in the following areas: 1) HIV and CVD science; 2) Reproductive endocrinology; 3) Bioinformatic and
statistical methods; 4) Clinical research operations; and 5) Grant development skills. The proposed study will
uncover novel microbiome-related connections between menopause, sex hormones, and subclinical CVD in
women with and without HIV. The training and research proposed in this award will directly set the stage for a
larger study in the WIHS, to more comprehensively assess longitudinal changes in the gut microbiome, microbial
translocation, and other cardiovascular risk biomarkers during the menopausal transition, and relate longitudinal
trajectories and microbiome-biomarker interactions to HIV infection and CVD progression; as well as support
future studies in other populations (e.g. men with HIV, non-HIV cohorts) and in clinical trials. Ultimately, this
research may lead to new avenues of therapeutic intervention targeting the gut microbiome, to lower CVD risk
in post-menopausal women with or without HIV."
10825594,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Breast cancer accounts for one in four cancer diagnoses in women, affecting up to one in eight women in the
United States. All patients with breast cancer undergo surgery, yet surgery is not without risks and is associated
with a multitude of side effects. Many of the complications from surgery are from the use of general anesthesia
and intra- and postoperative opioids. Side effects of general anesthesia include hemodynamic instability,
postoperative nausea and vomiting, suppression of cell-mediated immunity, cognitive impairment, and delayed
recovery. The use of opioids is also associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting, ileus, urinary retention,
pruritus, and immunosuppression. Frequently, intra- and postoperative opioid use often leads to an increased
risk for non-medical opioid use and opioid-sparing techniques are needed. Extensive data supports the use of
non-pharmacological interventions including hypnosedation (HS) for patients undergoing invasive medical
procedures. In a variety of medical populations, patients using HS report significantly less anxiety and pain,
demonstrate beneficial physiological responses, request less analgesic medication, and spend less time in the
procedure room than controls. In a number of studies, the improved patient-reported outcomes and overall
satisfaction was also paralleled by decreased medical costs. All of these previous studies either delivered the
HS during simple medical procedures (e.g., breast biopsy) or before more invasive procedures such as breast
surgery and no RCTs have provided hypnosis during surgery delivered by one of the surgical team members.
The proposed trial will randomize women and men with breast cancer scheduled for a lumpectomy ± sentinel
node biopsy to one of three groups: 1) surgery with a local anesthetic, fentanyl, and HS before and during surgery
(HS); 2) HS before surgery with usual care general anesthesia (HS-GA; propofol infusion, fentanyl, and local
anesthetic); or 3) Usual care general anesthesia (GA). The study will examine differences in opioid use, pain,
anxiety, nausea, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction before and after surgery. Recovery will be also tracked 14
and 90 days after surgery. The study will also examine group differences in medical costs associated with
procedure time, recovery room time, and use of medications. This project will allow further exploration of HS
during surgery provided by a clinical team member and to explore the biopsychosocial processes associated
with analgesia and opioid use, anesthesia, and pain and examine baseline individual difference factors
associated with the intervention effects and recovery. We specifically propose to test the hypothesis that HS
during breast cancer surgery will result in better analgesia control along with lower opioid use, less pain and
psychological stress, and faster recovery than GA. Data from the proposed study will help to move this
intervention into the standard of care and expand the use of HS into other invasive medical procedures where
general anesthesia may be avoided."

Social interaction is fundamental to the most universal of human experiences, such as family life, business, and
romance; however, social dysfunction is a debilitating hallmark of major neurodevelopmental disorders, including
autism and schizophrenia. Despite significant advances, the mechanisms underlying social dysfunction and
other core behavioral symptoms associated with neurodevelopmental disorders remain elusive and interventions
limited. There is growing consensus in support of a ‘two hit’ hypothesis for neurodevelopmental disorders, in
which a secondary environmental factor initiates abnormal developmental programming that contributes to
behavioral dysfunction in genetically predisposed individuals. Among environmental factors, diet is a leading
factor contributing to host disease susceptibility. Notably, diet is the chief determinant of host gut microbiome
composition. Through modulation of host immune function, and even the brain and behavior, the gut microbiome
is emerging as a major influence on host health and well-being. Disruption, or ‘dysbiosis,’ of the gut microbiome
is, in turn, associated with several common inflammatory disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease and
metabolic syndrome. Dysbiosis is also observed in neuropsychiatric patient populations, who have a high rate
of gastrointestinal symptom comorbidity; yet, the relationship between dysbiosis of the gut microbiome and
neurodevelopmental or other neuropsychiatric disorders is poorly understood. In this project, we will determine
if maternal high-fat diet (MHFD)-induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiome during pregnancy contributes to
descendant neurobehavioral dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms. Previously, we reported that MHFD
induces dysbiosis of the male offspring gut microbiome as well as social dysfunction and underlying deficits in
synaptic plasticity in the social reward circuit. Recently, we identified a sexually dimorphic effect of MHFD on
offspring behavior–stronger social deficits are evident in males versus females–however, we observed dysbiosis
of both the male and female MHFD offspring gut. We reasoned that if the maternal gut microbiome is causally
related to offspring social dysfunction, then enduring dysbiosis of the female MHFD offspring gut microbiome in
the F1 generation may be sufficient to impair neurodevelopment and behavior in F2 males. Indeed, we observed
robust social dysfunction in male, but not female, F2 offspring. Here, we will test the hypothesis that HFD-induced
dysbiosis of the maternal gut microbiome drives abnormal fetal programming in F1 offspring that underlies social
dysfunction in both F1 and F2 males. In Aim 1, we will ask how HFD/MHFD affects remodeling of the P/F1
maternal gut microbiome during pregnancy. In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of HFD/MHFD on maternal
immune function, fetal immune imprinting, and the embryonic brain. In Aim 3, we will determine if modulation of
the maternal gut microbiome during pregnancy can rescue descendant social dysfunction. This study will yield
key insight into the mechanisms by which MHFD modulates fetal development and the potential for therapeutic
targeting of the maternal microbiome to prevent adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in descendant generations."
10928722,"The abuse of psychomotor stimulants, including cocaine and methamphetamine, as well as the
synthetic cathinone drugs (“bathsalts”), continues to wreak havoc worldwide and in the United States
of America, with most individuals that suffer with stimulant use disorders going untreated. The more
established stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine are highly addictive, can be acutely
lethal and can result in long-term brain alterations with many implications for health and well-being.
Recent studies show that synthetic cathinone psychoactive drugs 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone
(MDPV), α-pyrrolidinopentiophenone (α-PVP) and associated close analogs are a highly potent and
efficacious reinforcers in animal models. These compounds tend to be used as cheaper or more
available substitutes in lower socioeconomic populations, by incarcerated individuals, etc. Efforts to
develop small molecule or vaccine therapies for psychomotor stimulant dependence have not, as yet,
succeeded. It continues to be critical to better understand how stimulant dependence is established
and maintained so as to better prevent stimulant addiction before it is established. This project will
investigate the situational and behavioral contributors to escalating stimulant drug taking in rat models
of intravenous self-administration, consistent with the goals of NOSI NOT-DA-21-028. Studies
proposed under Aim I will determine if binge-like acquisition of psychostimulant self-administration
alters the propensity for escalated intake under extended access conditions. The goal is to
understand the consequences of initial uncontrolled consumption and whether that has lasting
consequences for dependence. Studies under Aim II will determine if the intra-cranial self-stimulation
(ICSS) reward threshold indexes the escalation in self-administration under extended access
conditions, in a novel test of a longstanding negative-reinforcement framework for understanding
escalating stimulant use. Finally, investigations under Aim III will determine if alternating cathinone
and methamphetamine use alters the escalation of self-administration. These novel poly-drug models
will address an understudied phenomenon whereby some human stimulant users substitute drugs
depending on cost and availability. In total, these proposed studies will advance our understanding of
the development of dependence on psychomotor stimulant drugs."

Sufficient quantity and quality of sleep is critical for maintaining optimal physical and mental health. Indeed,
inadequate sleep can influence many crucial physiological functions and impair cognitive performance and
mood regulation. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer are at particularly high risk for sleep disorders, and
disordered sleep may influence the progression of their disease as more aggressive tumors have been
observed among women who routinely sleep fewer hours. Despite evidence of sleep disorders emerging
prior to diagnosis in cancer patients, and the potentially devastating consequences, the etiology of tumor-
induced sleep disorders remains unknown. The goal of this R21 application is to determine the physiological
mechanisms through which mammary tumors impair sleep. The guiding hypothesis of the proposed research
is that mammary tumors increase serum ghrelin concentration, which alters the activity of orexin-hypocretin
(OH) neurons, and in turn disrupts sleep. This proposal represents the first examination of ghrelin in cancer-
related sleep disruption. Our preliminary data demonstrate that mammary tumors express ghrelin mRNA,
significantly elevate serum ghrelin concentrations, and alter sleep. We also have shown that mammary
tumors increase the number of activated orexin/hypocretin (OH) neurons in the hypothalamus, a population
of cells critical for sleep-wake regulation. Aim 1 will use converging pharmacological and genetic (CRISPR)
approaches to test the hypothesis that ghrelin is a causal factor in altered hypothalamic OH activity and sleep
disruption among tumor bearing mice. Aim 2 will use a DREADD approach to establish whether OH neurons
in the lateral hypothalamus play a causal role in tumor-disrupted sleep. Together, the proposed studies will
provide an extensive characterization of the effects of mammary tumors on sleep and the potentially
disruptive role of increased ghrelin concentration and altered OH neuronal activity. The long-range goal of
this research is to improve the mental and physical health of cancer patients, as well as their quality of life,
through the normalization of sleep beginning at cancer diagnosis; the first step in achieving this goal is
determining the mechanisms through which tumors alter sleep."

This renewal proposal for the Adult and Pediatric Rheumatology Training Program provides exceptional
basic, translational and clinical research training to post-doctoral fellows interested in research careers
studying rheumatic diseases and autoimmunity. Now in its 15th year, the training program leverages
Stanford’s rich research and training culture to provide the environment to train the next generation of academic
independent investigators in rheumatology and Immunology. The program focuses on training rheumatology and
immunology MD/MD PhD fellows, as well as MD/MD PhD or PhD fellows from other departments who have strong
commitments to these research areas. Physician fellows are eligible at the end of their clinical training and
must commit to 2 years of training with >80% protected research time. Fellows can select a training track in
either Basic and Translational Research (Track 1) or Clinical Investigation (Track 2). Training in each track
is comprised of a hypothesis-driven research project, required and recommended course work, and skill
development (e.g., grant application and manuscript preparation) required for a successful independent
research career. Trainees in Clinical Investigation (Track 2) are eligible for obtaining a Master of Science
(MS) in Epidemiology or in Health Services Policy Research. Other trainees in Track 2 have selected course
work from the MS curriculum. Trainees in either track also have the option of pursuing a MS in Biomedical
Informatics. In addition to course work, all trainees in both Tracks are required to attend weekly lectures in
rheumatic diseases, journal clubs, the interdepartmental Stanford Immunology Program annual retreat,
semiannual T32 fellow specific retreats, the five-day Intensive Course in Clinical Research, and Responsible
Conduct of Research courses. Multiple other offerings specific to Track 1 include advanced immunology
seminars in molecular, cellular, and translational immunology or in computational and systems immunology.
For Track 2, elective/advanced courses are offered through the Departments of Epidemiology and Health
Research Policy that include study design, epidemiologic methods, statistical analysis, clinical trial
methodology, outcomes research, health economics, and database design and management. Cross-
fertilization between the two tracks is fostered by all trainees having a primary mentor in one of the two
tracks and a secondary mentor in the other track. These various courses, conferences, retreats, and venues for
presentation will provide opportunities for interactions between the rheumatology and immunology T32
trainees and the many other immunology fellows, faculty and students involved in the broad base of research
at Stanford. Faculty mentors are selected carefully for their research expertise and mentoring competencies.

 Child maltreatment (CM) (physical abuse, sexual abuse, and child neglect) is a pervasive public health
problem with ~600,000 substantiated incidents annually, 12.5% of US children experiencing CM by age 18,
and an annual incident economic burden of $428B. More than 32% of US children will have a Child Protective
Service (CPS) report by age 12 and 3.5M children are 'screened in' for CPS investigations each year, with a
growing body of research showing that even an investigation can have deleterious impacts on child
development. CM investigations are especially ubiquitous for racially minoritized youth. Survivors are at high
risk myriad deleterious psychosocial and health outcomes thus perpetuating racial disparities. Despite major
policy initiatives, CM rates have not appreciably fluctuated in over two decades and there are recent increases
in CM referrals, investigations, and infant deaths attributed to CM. The proposed Translational Center for Child
Maltreatment Studies (TCCMS) renewal (Phase 2) will capitalize on the successes of Phase 1 by providing
continuity in the cutting-edge, observational cohort study (Project 1) to, in turn, fill a critical gap in CM
research—namely, variable pathways into and through the transition to adulthood (T2A). A new project
extends promising models of practice to expand access to high-quality forensic evaluations for suspected CM
(Project 2). The Dissemination and Outreach Core (DOC) will continue practice and policy-relevant community-
engaged research with established county, state, and federal partners, translate TCCMS products into
workable, scalable solutions, and disseminate these products—through a comprehensive communications plan
designed by the Resource Core—to the world. The Admin Core will elevate the TCCMS-developed primary
prevention efforts and its Research to Policy Collaboration (RPC) model to national prominence, facilitating
high-level exposure of TCCMS products and solutions to mobilize larger public investment in prevention and
intervention. The TCCMS has three broad Aims: Aim A—continue high quality, translational research that
directly impacts youth who encounter the protective service system; Aim B—continue hallmark community-
engaged partnerships and, through state-of-the-art communications, disseminate knowledge, strategies, and
solutions that reduce disparities and better-protect children; Aim C—continue to serve as a national resource
for scaffolding science to impact policy, for the primary prevention of CM, and for nurturing the next generation
in cutting-edge science and translation. Through these Aims, the TCCMS will continue to operate as THE
premier center where transdisciplinary scientists work in conjunction with practitioners and policy makers to
resource, conduct, and disseminate impactful new science that can change health and developmental
trajectories for survivors, mobilize public investment in CM prevention and access to intervention, accelerate
science to practice, spark dynamic system-wide solutions, and inspire future generations to do the same."

Cores through personnel, expertise, administrative supports, and research tools (Aim 1), as well as distal
needs through an innovative communications plan that introduces an integrated, modern framework for
translating and communicating information and tools to the public and the larger field (Aim 2). This
communications plan will (1) create an environment where new networks and partnerships of scholars,
trainees, practitioners, and community members can be facilitated, (2) be a hub of scientific information and
evidence-based tools for anyone who is in search of the latest innovations CM research, policy, and practice,
and (3) institute a communications system that will alert the professional and lay communities to the best and
most up to date information in the CM field. Before information can be disseminated, it must first be effectively
translated to meet the needs of the audiences it intends to impact. As such, the RC will create a CM
information Translation Team (TT) comprised of investigators and trained communications professionals who
will compile, organize, and synthesize research findings into translational messages that resonate with
stakeholder needs and specifications. These translational products will then be handed off to an experienced
Communications Team (CT) who will disseminate them widely via the RC communications platforms. These
platforms include a “gateway” website that will house (1) the science warehouse where relevant, evidence-
based science and practice tools are curated, catalogued, and stored, (2) the policy warehouse where TCCMS
policy products as well as news and information about major CM policy and practice reforms from across the
US are showcased, and (3) the member forum which engages followers and members in active discourse
regarding major scientific issues and advances from across the field. These platforms will also include
listserves, newsletters, email, and all relevant forms of digital media that are strategically positioned for
maximum reach and impact.
The RC is guided by the following 2 Aims:
Aim 1: By overseeing and administering shared resources included in the RC as well as resources provided by
the impressive institutional match commitment from Penn State, the RC will provide the staff, expertise, and
other research support to meet the proximal needs of TCCMS Projects and Cores.
Aim 2: The RC will provide the staff and expertise that will locate, translate, and share the products and

10857255,"PROJECT 1: PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Over one third of U.S. youth are investigated for child maltreatment (CM) before the age of 18. CM represents
an especially potent early life stressor with a profound impact on youth’s psychological and physical well-being.
Among other things, CM increases the risk of many chronic diseases of aging, the roots of which can already
be found during childhood and adolescence. Thus, a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms
through which CM is associated with subsequent health is needed to improve the lifelong health trajectories of
youth with a CM history, a high-risk yet understudied group, as well as to better understand biological
mechanisms connecting early life adversity to later life health and well-being more generally. This project
proposes the continuation of the Child Health Study (CHS; Project 1 of HD089922, PI: Noll), as part of which
525 youth aged 8-13 years who were recently investigated for CM as well as 175 comparison youth without a
history of CM are being followed prospectively, completing biannual assessments. Taking advantage of this
unique and exceptionally well-characterized cohort, we will follow youth as they arrive at the transition to
adulthood, an important developmental period characterized by continued plasticity, the occurrence of many
important developmental milestones, and with important implications for lifelong health and well-being. To this
end, we will assess how early life experiences impact health during the transition to adulthood as well as the
likelihood of a successful transition to adulthood (marked by greater academic achievement, career readiness,
social capital, service continuity and reduced financial interdependence, early parenthood, and system
involvement). In the process, we pay particular attention to the importance of key moderators (e.g., genotype,
gender, race/ethnicity, pubertal timing, and neighborhood characteristics). Additionally, added emphasis is
placed throughout on better understanding the experiences of racial/ethnic minority youth in the cohort (e.g., by
examining the possible protective role of racial/ethnic identity) and to examine the impact of the
intersectionality between race-related stressors and experiences of CM. Finally, we will also be able to
leverage this cohort to understand in greater detail how various aspects of youth’s CM experiences and youth’s
reactions to such experiences are differentially predictive of health and well-being during the transition to
adulthood as well as a successful transition to adulthood more broadly. The interdisciplinary research team
includes expertise in the assessment of biological embedding mechanisms and health among vulnerable youth
and the retention of prospective cohorts of CM survivors. Resulting data will make important contributions to
the CM and early life adversity literatures. It will also inform future prevention and intervention efforts with the
ultimate goal of reducing the risk of adverse long-term health consequences among some of the most
vulnerable individuals in the population."
10857257,"PROJECT 2: ABSTRACT
Survivors of sexual abuse/assault (SA) require timely, skilled, trauma-informed health care to address injuries,
risk of infection/pregnancy, forensic evidence collection to aid justice outcomes, and to provide psychological
support essential to healing. SA trauma can have devastating impacts on individual health and poses great
costs to society. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to SA victimization due to their developmental stage.
Therefore, it is essential that adolescents who experience SA have access to specialized compassionate,
trauma-informed health and forensic care to mitigate trauma and that promotes healing and justice. Due to a
national shortage of forensic health care specialists, great disparities exist in individuals’ access to quality SA
care. The Sexual Assault Forensic Examination Telehealth (SAFE-T) program aims to decrease disparities by
providing expert sexual assault nurse examiner (teleSANE) care to rural and underserved hospitals through
telehealth technology. TeleSANEs provide 24/7 support to local nurses and patients during SA exams,
ensuring best practices, proper evidence collection, and a supportive experience exists for the patient. The
Sexual Assault Forensic Examination Telehealth (SAFE-T) Adolescent Evaluation is a multi-site (rural and
urban) study designed to evaluate the impact of the SAFE-T model on adolescent care quality, healthcare and
advocacy service utilization, health and well-being, and prosecutorial decision-making. Using a pre-post
implementation design, we will prospectively gather data from 176 adolescents who receive SA care from our 8
established partner hospitals and compare SAFE-T (n=117) to usual care (UC; n=59) prior to SAFE-T
implementation. Additional interdisciplinary community data will provide key information for this evaluation. The
aims of this evaluation will: 1) Test SAFE-T vs. UC differences in forensic SA care quality by assessing
survivor experience of care and through independent expert review of examination evidence and
documentation; 2) Examine group differences in short and long-term health and well-being outcomes such as
PTSD, school/work engagement, health care and advocacy service utilization, risk-taking, and coping; 3)
Examine pre- and post-SAFE-T group differences in prosecutorial decision-making and case progression by
interviewing district attorneys about key elements (i.e. survivor participation in seeking justice outcomes,
quality and availability of forensic evidence) that influence decision-making; and 4) Conduct an economic cost-
benefit analysis (CBA) of the SAFE-T model implementation using high quality, interdisciplinary data,
monetization of study outcomes (e.g., health and mental healthcare utilization, program cost-benefit, retention
of SANEs, survivor engagement in school/work), and efficiency/effectiveness of justice processes. This
represents the most comprehensive evaluation of telehealth to improve SA access and quality of care for
adolescents. The findings will elucidate the influence of forensic SA telehealth consultation on care quality,
health and well-being, and resolution of trauma to support a healthy transition to adulthood."
10857260,"DISSEMINATION AND OUTREACH CORE: PROJECT ABSTRACT
To reduce the occurrence of child maltreatment (CM) and improve the quality and effectiveness of supports
provided to victims, it is critical to enhance the capacity of child protective services agencies to use research
evidence to enhance the identification and use of practices and policies that promote effective prevention,
detection or response to CM and its effects. Yet, these agencies face significant time, resource, and expertise
constraints in using their own data to understand and troubleshoot fundamental and longstanding problems,
such as the high and racially-disparate rate of fatalities for children with prior agency contact. The TCCMS
DOC seeks to use the substantive and methodological expertise of the TCCMS investigators and affiliates to
directly aid agencies in addressing their highest-priority concerns. In Aim 1, the DOC will engage and leverage
community expertise to define priority areas for scientific innovation in the prevention, detection, and response
to CM by developing a Community-Based Research Network (CBRN) tasked with defining and prioritizing
systemic problems that limit the capacity of child protection agencies to effectively identify, protect, and support
victims of CM. The CBRN is comprised of agency leadership at the state and local levels as well as leadership
in private and nonprofit child-serving agencies that hold significant influence over state and local policies and
practices. In Aim 2, the DOC will design and implement collaborative research studies based on identified
priorities of the CBRN, focusing on areas in which our community partners commit to use of research to
implement policy or practice reforms. Under Aim 2, we will also help other TCCMS investigators partner with
the CBRN or other community leaders in the development of large-scale externally-funded projects that
respond to important CM policy or practice concerns. Lastly, under Aim 3, the DOC will translate practice-
responsive research findings for direct application in policy and practice and disseminate to stakeholders. In
collaboration with the TCCMS Resource and Admin Cores, we will translate research for non-academic
audiences – the public, practitioners, and policymakers – in the form of practice and policy briefs, webinars,
and trainings. Lastly, the DOC will enhance the education of future scholars and professionals who will use or
generate research evidence through outreach and engagement of undergraduate, graduate, and post-
graduate students training for work in child-serving professions or for applied research careers to inform the
work of professionals in CM and related fields."

SUMMARY
Tau is a member of the microtubule-associated proteins family, which is mainly expressed by neurons,
especially in their axons where it controls the polymerization and stabilization of the microtubules and regulates
axonal transport. Tauopathies, characterized by abnormal intracellular accumulation of aggregated and/or
hyperphosphorylated tau within neurons, is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a number of other
disorders including frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17 (FTDP-17), Pick disease, progressive
supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. Tauopathies are among the most crippling conditions that
affect our rapidly growing aging population. Due to the lack of effective diagnostics, preventative means, and
treatments, these diseases significantly impair the daily life of patients and markedly impose financial costs to
them, their family members and society. The retina is an extension of the neural network of the brain. It shares
many similar pathophysiological changes and underlying mechanisms with the brain during neurodegenerative
diseases including AD. Growing consensus among researchers and clinicians is that the interdependency of
eye and brain maybe more intricate than we thought. While dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS)
will influence visual function in different ways, emerging evidence suggests that visual impairment may
contribute to neurodegeneration in the brain. Multiple cohort clinical studies demonstrate that visual-impairment
diseases including glaucoma and cataract increase risk of developing dementia and AD, and cataract
extraction is significantly associated with lower risk of dementia development. However, conflicting studies
remain. Considering clinical studies cannot control for confounding variables such as age, the stage when
cognitive impairment becomes noticeable, and the extent of visual impairment, it is not surprising that
conflicting results were reported, and a cause-and-effect relationship from vision loss to AD could not be
tested. Therefore, we propose to use well-controlled animal experiments to test the hypothesis that visual
impairment accelerates tauopathy in the brain. We will test this hypothesis using two distinct visual impairment
models that model retinal neuronal injury and visual deprivation as seen in glaucoma and cataract,
respectively, but at much severer extents so that we can unambiguously test the relationship between vision
loss and tauopathy. This proposal is highly in line with the objectives of “NOT-AG-21-044” to “investigating how
functional changes in sensory systems impact the development and progression of AD”. Completion of the
proposed studies will provide important new knowledge that will fill the current knowledge gaps and provide
scientific base for preventing and treating tauopathy by restoring good vision. Models developed in this project
will serve as the foundation for further investigation of mechanisms by which visual loss causes
neurodegeneration in tauopathy."
10872245,"ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD) disproportionately affect minoritized
populations. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, older Hispanic adults in the United States are estimated to have
a 50% increased risk of AD and are projected to bear the largest relative increase in AD/ADRD cases by 2060.
Mexican Americans not only represent the largest segment of Hispanics in the United States, but they also
experience a high burden of cardiometabolic diseases, which has the potential to increase AD/ADRD disparities
over the next decades. However, Hispanics are underrepresented in epidemiological settings and more research
is needed on this ethnic group to identify the factors contributing to AD/ADRD disparities. In this project, we
propose to re-establish an epidemiological cohort initiated in 1979 to study ethnic differences in diabetes and
cardiovascular disease. The San Antonio Heart Study enrolled 5,158 Mexican American and non-Hispanic White
adults from socioculturally diverse neighborhoods in San Antonio, Texas. Through this grant, survivors will be
invited to a new study focused on cognitive aging and AD/ADRD: The San Antonio Heart and Mind Study
(SAHMS). We will perform comprehensive assessments for cognitive function, brain MRI, amyloid and tau PET,
the measurement of blood- and CSF-based biomarkers, cardiometabolic disease, psychosocial attributes, and
sociocultural factors. Participants will also be invited to our brain donation program for further neuropathological
characterization. By leveraging the rich set of longitudinal data obtained four decades ago and newly collected
information through this grant, we have an ideal setting to better understand the role of midlife and late-life factors
contributing to AD/ADRD disparities in Mexican American older adults. Our talented multidisciplinary team offers
complementary expertise for the success of this project. Results from our study have the potential to inform
health policies aiming to prevent and delay AD/ADRD over the next decades, especially in the underserved
population of Mexican Americans."
10890772,"Title: Plk1 as a prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer
Abstract
Because androgen receptor (AR) signaling is essential for development of prostate cancer (PCa),
including castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), androgen signaling inhibitors (ASI) are
becoming the first line treatment for CRPC. However, the limited clinical success of ASIs makes it
urgent to develop new approaches to treat ASI-resistant CRPC. Ionizing radiation is another major
approach to treat CRPC with limited efficacy. Olaparib, a PARP1 inhibitor, is recently developed and
used to target cancers with a defect in DNA repair, such as BRCA mutations. Unfortunately, the usage
of olaparib in CRPC is profoundly limited by the fact that BRCA mutations only occur in low
percentages of PCa. Thus, identifying additional critical regulators that control DNA damage response
(DDR) is of significance as it will identify specific patient populations who will be responsive to olaparib.
The objective is to define the role of polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) in regulating DDR and to exploit its unique
impact on the efficacy of olaparib for ASI-resistant CRPC patients. The central hypothesis is that Plk1
phosphorylation of Mre11, a component of MRN (Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1) complex, and MDC1 (mediator
of DNA damage checkpoint 1), leads to premature termination of DNA damage checkpoint, reduced
DNA repair, thus increased olabparib efficacy based on the concept of synthetic lethality. Our data
show that Plk1 directly phosphorylates Mre11, whose activation is the first step in response to DNA
damage and that Plk1 phosphorylation of Mre11 leads to recovery from DNA damage checkpoint and
reduced DNA repair. We also show that MDC1, a protein that further amplifies DDR signals, is a Plk1
substrate. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three Specific Aims - (1) to dissect how Plk1
phosphorylation of Mre11 regulates the MRN complex; (2) to test whether Plk1 phosphorylation of
MDC1 contributes to premature termination of checkpoint; and (3) to determine whether Plk1 is a
prognostic biomarker for PCa. These complementary aims will be accomplished using biochemical
analyses of signaling intermediates and employing both cell culture systems and genetic strategies
with inducible mouse models. The rationale for the research is that it will probe the importance of Plk1
to DDR and to examine whether Plk1 can be a predictable biomarker for the efficacy of olaparib in
CRPC. This contribution is significant because, if positive, the results of the proposed study will support
an immediate clinical trial to compare the efficacy of olaparib in CRPC patients carrying different levels
of Plk1. The research is innovative as it approaches the disease from a novel Plk1 signaling pathway,
challenging the traditional view that Plk1 functions solely to regulate mitotic events. These studies
provide a new paradigm for therapies by identifying the key regulator of DDR that is critical for the
efficacy of olaparib in CRPC."
10842330,"ABSTRACT
Although bipolar I disorder is a dynamic condition expressing a wide range of affective, cognitive and
neurovegetative symptoms, it is defined by the occurrence of mania. Mania typically first emerges in
adolescence and young adulthood, and it is a strongly predictive phenotype. Moreover, the early course of
bipolar I disorder is progressive, as euthymic periods shorten over time. Additionally, bipolar I disorder is
strongly familial with heritability rates approaching 85%. A family history of bipolar I disorder increases risk
for mania as well as a number of other psychiatric conditions, including suicidal behaviors and reward
hypersensitivity. Together, these characteristics suggest that bipolar I disorder results from an inherited
failure during adolescence to develop healthy neural systems that modulate mood and behavioral activation.
Complicating the inherited risk is that people with a family history of bipolar disorder also report higher rates
of early life adversity than the general population. Early life adversity is associated with lifelong elevated
rates of depression, anxiety and substance use disorders, impaired risk-reward processing, and suicide.
Consequently, during development individuals with a familial risk for bipolar I disorder may be exposed to a
dual risk, i.e. an inherited vulnerability and environmental early-life stress. How these risks interact to impact
brain development and subsequent outcomes in these individuals is not known.
 Mood and risk-reward behaviors are managed by intersecting ventral prefrontal networks. These
networks undergo substantial development in the transition from adolescence to young adulthood (when
bipolar I disorder emerges) in which maturation of prefrontal networks leads to adaptive adult emotional
regulation and risk-reward processing. Abnormalities in these networks are commonly described in both
bipolar disorder and in response to early life adversity, with many shared characteristics. With these
considerations in mind, we hypothesize that heritability for bipolar I disorder interacts with early life adversity
to synergistically disrupt healthy ventral prefrontal network development during adolescence, underlying a
cumulative increased risk for developing mania and other conditions more common in bipolar families. To
test this hypothesis, over a four-year interval we will assess trajectories in ventral prefrontal network
connectivity in youth at-familial-risk for bipolar I disorder compared to those without this risk, and the
interaction with or without early life trauma, to determine whether these risks cumulatively lead to increasing
emergence of: 1) mood symptoms and syndromes, 2) substance misuse, 3) suicidal behaviors, and 4)
approach motivation hypersensitivity. These results can inform future approaches to prevent illness onset
and progression in individuals at risk for or early in the course of bipolar disorder."
10917192,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall
This renewal proposal seeks to continue the Georgia Cystic Fibrosis Research and Translation Core
Center (the Georgia CF Core Center) at Emory University, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Augusta
University, and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Funded with partial budget less than two years ago, the
Center has rapidly ramped up activities during these pandemic times and already has had great impact on the
CF research community in Georgia. Center research funded by this P30 grant focuses on non-pulmonary
aspects of CF disease central to the NIDDK mission, including CF-related diabetes (CFRD), CF-related liver
and bone disease, and the impact of CF on nutritional status and GI function. Unique to our Center is the study
of the relationship between these co-morbidities and lifestyle/behavioral choices such as diet, exercise, and
sleep. The Center's research is focused on and enabled by the ~900 patients followed at the participating
institutions. The research base has grown to include 73 investigators, across basic and clinical departments at
several institutions, with >$27M in direct costs for CF-related research in the current year. These investigators
are addressing issues that are becoming ever more important to the health of people with CF, as successes
with small-molecule therapeutics enable an “aging” CF population. On the opposite end of the spectrum are
studies in toddlers and young children on the genesis of these co-morbidities which have the potential for
defining early preventive interventions. We integrate data from multiple platforms spanning from basic science
to clinical research informatics to enable longitudinal study of patients with the goal of identifying factors
associated with disease progression and advancing our understanding of the CF therapeutic landscape. These
clinical and research data are incorporated into the novel Georgia CF Data Warehouse.
 Aim 1: To provide a robust, well-coordinated environment for CF biomedical research.
 Aim 2: To facilitate and enable the expansion of the funded research in non-pulmonary complications of CF.
 Aim 3: To attract new investigators focused on non-pulmonary aspects of CF who will bring new expertise
 that will advance new perspectives on pathophysiology and treatment, and launch new collaborations.
We will accomplish these aims by the coordinated activities of three biomedical research Cores:
  Diabetes, Endocrinology, & GI/Hepatology Core
  Nutrition, Lifestyle, & Behaviors Core  Clinical Research & Informatics Core
These research cores are supported by an Administrative Core which ensures the efficient use of resources and
strengthens the intellectual environment for research through a robust Enrichment Program. The successful Pilot
& Feasibility Program proposes two new projects; both prior projects already have received extramural support.
Continued support of the Core Center will ensure a vigorous research enterprise focused on non-pulmonary CF
disease, uncovering new disease mechanisms with potential for translation to therapeutic strategies."
10877882,"The major obstacle to curing HIV infection is a durable and persistent latent reservoir of
infected cells. The latent HIV reservoir is not eliminated by antiretroviral therapy (ART), and ART
interruption results in uncontrolled virus rebound within weeks. Despite the importance of this reservoir,
little is known about the biological parameters that influence it, or the effects of recreational drug use on
it. While the size of the HIV reservoir is fairly stable within individuals, it varies greatly (up to 1000-fold)
between individuals, suggesting that host factors influence its size. These factors likely include a
complex set of genes, transcriptional pathways, immune cell populations, and environmental
influences, including drugs of abuse. Cannabinoid (CB) use, in particular, is prevalent amongst persons
with HIV (PWH) with up to 49% PWH reporting regular use. However, the impact of CBs on the HIV
reservoir has not been fully investigated. CBs have immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory activities
through activation of the CB2 receptor that is widely expressed in immune cells, including CD4 T cells
that harbor most of the HIV reservoir. Our hypothesis is that CB interacts with host pathways and
factors that impact the size of the HIV reservoir. Due to the complex nature of the interaction of CB
with the host immune system, new computational tools are required lo achieve a deep understanding of
how CB impacts both the host immune system and the HIV reservoir.
Our goal is to develop a novel framework for heterogeneous data integration, including new
tools for dimension reduction and interpretable machine learning, and apply it to data from three
HIV cohort studies (US-UNC, Switzerland, and US-Duke). This approach will reveal relationships
between host characteristics and HIV reservoir size, both in the presence and absence of CB use. In
Aim 1, we develop dimension reduction {DR) tools, with application to heterogeneous data from the
US-UNC PWH cohort. In Aim 2, we develop a new powerful interpretable machine technique -
alternating decision trees (adtrees) - and apply it to data from a large PWH Swiss cohort study to
reveal factors that determine HIV reservoir size. In Aim 3, both tools will be applied to data from a
unique cohort of CB-using PWH at Duke University, to explain the effects of cannabis on the
immune system of PWH and on the latent HIV reservoir."

The overall objective of the project is to contribute fundamental understanding of the exquisitely selective
recognition of protein tyrosine kinases for their protein substrates. Selectivity is generated from multiple factors.
One factor is spatial localization of the kinase to the proper regions in the cell through docking interactions
often mediated by domains independent of the catalytic domain. A second factor is amino-acid sequence
recognition of the substrate polypeptide chain near the cleavage site. Protein kinases play a major role in
disease and are second to only G-protein coupled receptors for the most targeted protein group for drug
development. Among all protein kinases, tyrosine kinases occur most frequently on a list of cancer-driver
genes, and are the most clinically targeted to date. The immediate objectives of this project are to 1) achieve a
physical rationale for a new entropy-driven allosteric phosphorylation mechanism that regulates tandem SH2
domains of Syk that dock Syk to membrane immunoreceptors; 2) determine if the tandem SH2 domains also
serve to localize Syk to cytoplasmic regions in conjunction with newly discovered functionalities of Syk; 3)
define the structure of the substrate polypeptide chain existing the C-terminal side of the catalytic site of Src
kinase and several other tyrosine kinases in order to evaluate a new perspective on kinase substrate
recognition determinants; and 4) identify new tyrosine kinase ligands that are substrate like and interact in the
shallow groove where the substrate polypeptide chain binds. To accomplish these objectives, a variety of
solution NMR studies will be conducted to characterize molecular interactions, define three-dimensional
structure and estimate thermodynamic parameters of tyrosine kinase-peptide substrate and tyrosine kinase-
protein substrate complexes. The NMR and biophysical analyses will be tightly integrated with computer
simulation methods selected to effectively explore large regions of protein conformational space. To broaden
impact, the knowledge obtained from using purified samples and computer simulations will be complemented
and validated with cell-based experiments to inform on cellular functionality. Finally, chemical screening using
a phosphorylation-based selection with DNA-encoded libraries of high complexity, will identify new
substrate-like inhibitor molecules of Src. The expected outcomes will advance scientific knowledge on the
physical mechanisms determining selective substrate phosphorylation by these key enzymes in human health.
Successful execution of the research plan would also identify small-molecule ligands with potent and selective
cellular activity, and impact future efforts to develop molecules useful for studying disease in animal models or
for cancer drug development."

Diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) is considered a cornerstone of care and essential
in helping people navigate self-management decisions and activities. Despite evidence that DSMES is a critical
component of diabetes care, participation remains low. Emerging adulthood (EA) has been described as the
distinct period between 18 and 25 years when adolescents work to achieve autonomy and explore life
possibilities in moving toward adulthood. Suboptimal self-management has been identified as a major problem
in EAs with type 1 diabetes (T1D), a particularly vulnerable group with an increased risk for poor diabetes-related
outcomes. In its current form DSMES has been cited for not meeting the needs of EAs, when EAs have
expressed interest in DSMES delivered with peer-supported, technological and applied learning-driven methods.
To address these challenges, we are applying information gained from the literature and key stakeholders to our
established Telemedicine for Reach, Education, Access and Treatment (TREAT) delivery model with a specific
focus on DSMES. TREAT-ED (for self-management EDucation) will be designed to specifically engage EAs in
DSMES by integrating DSMES objectives to support informed decision making, self-care, and preparation for
transfer to adult care, to improve outcomes. Diabetes care and education specialists (DCESs) will lead TREAT-
ED with a cohort of EAs and will 1) help to organize and facilitate group sessions delivered through telehealth
and 2) use continuous blood glucose monitoring (CGM) reports as personalized examples to drive established
DSMES content. With user-centered design techniques, we will evaluate implementation determinants and then
develop, build, and test the TREAT-ED model. Feasibility assessment of the impact of the model on EA patient
participation in DSMES along with clinical, psychosocial and behavioral outcomes will be examined. We
hypothesize that models that rely on current day strategies to engage EAs at high risk for diabetes-related
problems with effective self-management skills will improve DSMES engagement and outcomes. If proven to be
effective, this model is one that could be adapted for EAs who have transferred to adult diabetes care and other
patient populations throughout the US."
10872276,"Vascular homeostasis is critically dependent upon vasodilator factors released from the endothelium. The most
prominent of these factors is nitric oxide (NO), which is the main barometer of endothelial function and becomes
impaired in a broad range of diseases including coronary artery disease (CAD). In the human coronary and
adipose microcirculation, we have demonstrated a novel process where loss of NO-dependent flow-mediated
dilation (FMD) in subjects with CAD is compensated by the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from
endothelial mitochondria and subsequent H2O2-dependent dilation. Although both are vasodilators, H2O2, in
opposition to NO, generally promotes cell activation, inflammation, and atherosclerosis, and thus understanding
mechanisms responsible for this transition from NO to H2O2 may be key to developing novel strategies to improve
endothelial function in patients with CAD. The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the signaling mechanisms
that regulate the vasodilator switch from NO to H2O2 during CAD. Building on findings from the last cycle, this
proposal is designed to determine intracellular pathways responsible for a previously unappreciated gain of
function of endothelial transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels and its contribution to vasodilator
switch in CAD. We will test the central hypothesis that a synergy of shear-sensitive phospholipase A2-derived
arachidonic acid and NADPH oxidase signaling promotes TRPV4 activation and subsequent H2O2-dependent
dilation while cross-inhibiting NO-dependent dilation in CAD arterioles. Further, NADPH oxidases as novel aging-
and CAD-associated upstream regulators play a critical role in initiating the switch. This application brings
together expertise in vasomotion regulation, human microcirculation, and ion channel structural biology to identify
novel molecular mechanisms and interactions that regulate vasodilator switch during CAD. Specific Aims: (1) we
will determine the molecular mechanism of TRPV4 activation and arteriolar dilation by flow; and (2) we will
determine how NADPH oxidases regulate TRPV4 activation and conversion from NO to H2O2 as mediator of
FMD in CAD arterioles. Studies will be conducted on freshly isolated human arterioles and endothelial cells as
well as in vivo animal models, using a multifaceted approach incorporating isolated vessel reactivity, Ca2+
imaging, patch-clamping electrophysiology, mass spectrometry, RNA-Seq, mutagenesis, and ion channel
molecular modeling. Significance: our proposed studies will provide insight into fundamental mechanisms
regulating human microvascular function in health and disease and potentially impact our approach to coronary
microvascular dysfunction associated with CAD and a variety of other vascular pathologies."

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is an underrecognized common, immune-mediated skin disease
characterized by inflammatory nodules, abscesses, and sinus tracts in the groin, buttocks, and axillae
leading to devasting physical and emotional morbidity. HS significantly affects European Americans and
minorities such as African-Americans, Asians, and Latinos. Treatments for HS are poor, with only a
single FDA-approved therapy available. The paucity of treatments is driven by a profound lack of
understanding of HS pathogenesis, particularly with respect to the genetic pathways involved. In this
application, we utilize a variety of innovative approaches to address this significant gap. First, we perform
a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in European, African American, and Asian HS cases and
healthy controls. Second, we perform trans-ethnic genome wide meta-analysis to identify shared and
distinct genetic risk factors. Third, we will perform multi-racial spatial transcriptomics and proteomics of
HS skin to elucidate cell-cell interactions, and further identify causal GWAS variants through luciferase
reporter assays. Together, these studies will advance our knowledge of the genetic architecture and
immunobiology of HS in different racial populations and identify new biologic pathways that can be
therapeutically targeted."

10888191,"Project Summary: Müllerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS) or Anti- Müllerian Hormone (AMH), originally identified
for its role in male sex differentiation during development, has emerged as a significant molecule in female
reproduction. For example, MIS plays an important role in regulating follicle development and serum levels and
is now used as a measure of ovarian reserve. Mutations in MIS are associated with both male and female
reproductive disorders, including Persistent Müllerian Duct Syndrome (PMDS) in males and Polycystic Ovary
Syndrome (PCOS) in females. As a member of the TGFβ family, MIS signals through a type I and type II receptor.
Uniquely, MIS signals through its own type II receptor MISRII and the type I receptor Alk2, which is utilized by
multiple ligands. While previous studies have detailed TGFβ family ligand interactions, how MIS interacts, at the
molecular level, with MISRII and Alk2 is unknown. The objective of this proposal is to understand how MIS
interacts with its cognate receptors and how specific MIS signaling is generated through these receptors. Here,
we will combine both structural and functional approaches, including X-ray crystallography, cell-based signaling
assays, structure-based engineering, and biological models of fertility and ovarian protection. We will pursue the
following three specific aims (1) determine the crystal structure of MIS with MISRII and Alk2, (2) characterize the
MIS receptors and determine how the generate MIS-specific signaling, using both the extracellular and
intercellular domains and (3) generate MIS analogs that will be tested in both in vitro binding and cell-based
assays, along with in vivo assay including an AAV9 model of follicle suppression. Collectively, this proposal will
uncover how MIS interacts with its receptors providing a platform for developing reagents that modify MIS activity

10838513,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Black gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) face a disproportionate burden of HIV.
Focused, high-coverage PrEP in populations heavily impacted by HIV, such as Black MSM, could rapidly
reduce new HIV acquisition rates; however, its uptake among at-risk populations, especially Black MSM, has
been limited. Therefore, we propose to conduct urgently needed research on PrEP in a cohort of Black MSM,
including on the impact of relevant behaviors, particularly cannabis use, which is highly prevalent in Black
MSM. Research on the impact of cannabis use on PrEP has achieved conflicting results, and it has not been
rigorously studied in Black MSM. Therefore, the proposed R01 study will assess cross-sectional and
longitudinal associations between cannabis use and PrEP outcomes (e.g., use, adherence) and HIV
transmission risk (e.g. biological inflammation, sexual risk behavior) using event-level and objective biomarker
data among HIV-negative Black SMM. To address these specific aims, we will conduct the Networks and
Neighborhoods (N2) Cannabis PrEP Study in Chicago, IL. We will follow 250 HIV-negative participants from
the original N2 cohort for an additional one-year period with 3 study waves. We will use innovative and rigorous
methods, to collect additional data, such as Ecological Momentary Assessment methods and objective
measures of cannabis use, PrEP use, and immune function over 14-day periods at each wave. Potential
findings can impact intervention development and implementation, as well as inform policy to increase PrEP
uptake and adherence, address substance use, and decrease HIV transmission rates, and disparities."

Glioblastoma’s (GBM) invasive nature is part of the reason this primary brain tumor results in near 100%
mortality. Even with surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy, the median survival remains of only 12-15
months. Tumor invasion make complete surgical resection difficult leading to local recurrence within 2
centimeters of the original tumor in 90-95% of patients. Most systemically delivered chemotherapy agents are
ineffective against GBM because they cannot reach the brain at therapeutic concentrations due to the blood-
brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier is a highly selective and semi-permeable membrane that separates the
circulating blood from the brain tissues as a protective mechanism. The capillaries that line the blood brain barrier
have especially restrictive tight-junctions that significantly reduce permeation of systemically administered
chemotherapeutics to brain tissues. A promising strategy to avoid the blood-brain barrier and reduce dose-
limiting toxicities observed with systemic delivery is to administer drugs directly to the brain by implanting them
within the cavity left after GBM resection. One way to achieve this it to load drug into a biodegradable polymer
which allows for controlled temporal release of drug as the polymer degrades. Gliadel®, a biodegradable
polymeric wafer that delivers carmustine into the resection cavity, is a clinical example of this type of therapy,
and increased patient survival by 10-18 weeks. However, the use of more efficacious drugs, facilitated by recent
advancement in cancer genotyping, could greatly improve the success of interstitial therapy. This could lead to
personalized chemotherapeutic selection where one or more drugs can be co-administered based on a patient’s
tumor-specific genetic mutations. In addition, our preliminary data suggests that the release rate of drugs from
the polymer can greatly affect outcomes. Drug release rate can be controlled via polymer degradation rate as
well as formulation of the drug within the polymer. We hypothesize that more potent chemotherapies loaded into
biodegradable polymers tailored for optimal drug release rate would generate a platform that could be translated
to the clinics to improved GBM therapy."

The percent of Gram-negative bacterial infections that are resistant to common antibiotics has increased at an
alarming rate over the last decade, and there is now an acute need for the discovery of novel antibiotics
effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. We have made progress understanding the
relationship between physicochemical traits and compound accumulation in Gram-negative bacteria, enabling
us to convert several antibiotics with Gram-positive-only activity into versions that possess activity against key
Gram-negative pathogens. Most advanced is our FabI inhibitor fabimycin; FabI inhibition is a novel strategy
with no approved antibiotics that hit this target. The nature of the FabI enzyme is that it is only essential in
certain pathogenic bacteria, chief among them E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii; thus while fabimycin
is effective against large clinical isolate panels of these pathogens, it has no activity against beneficial
commensal bacteria that reside in the gut. A Gram-negative active antibiotic that spared the gut microbiome is
without precedent and would be a very significant development, given the well-documented deleterious effects
of broad-spectrum antibiotics in causing gut dysbiosis. In addition, our X-ray structures of fabimycin bound to
FabI reveal critical interactions between the ligand and the protein backbone, making bacterial resistance much
more challenging to arise than if interactions were solely with amino acid sidechains. Indeed, fabimycin has a
low frequency of resistance, and resistance in cell culture only evolves over a long period of time. Excitingly,
fabimycin is also active in multiple mouse and rat infection models, including those of soft tissue infection,
pneumonia, sepsis, and UTI. To become a true clinical candidate the Therapeutic Index (TI) of fabimycin needs
to be widened. Herein we propose development of more potent versions of fabimycin through application of a
recent understanding of the relationship between compound efflux and structure that has emerged from our
laboratories. Applying these lessons to fabimycin will enable us to systematically reduce its efflux liability,
leading to MIC values for optimized derivatives that are 5-fold more potent than fabimycin and will thus have
the appropriate TI for advancement. We have assembled a team of experts with the full suite of tools needed
for this work: medicinal chemistry, understanding of efflux, access to large panels of clinical isolates,
sophisticated models of antibacterial efficacy in mice and rats, and detailed pharmacokinetics and toxicology
in mice, rats, and dogs, and microbiome studies in mice and dogs. Our Critical Path provides specific criteria
for compound advancement and we are guided by best practices for antibiotic drug development as deliniated
by the FDA. Our plan is to select the lead candidate by the end of Year 2, and then spend the remaining three
years building a sophisticated data package that will facilitate rapid translation of this antibiotic to the clinic."
10863841,"PROJECT SUMMARY
To address the widely recognized decline in the physician-scientist workforce, new approaches are needed to
recruit talented physicians to pursue research as an integral part of their medical training and future careers. The
Stimulating Access to Research in Residency (StARR) initiative provides a new point of access to research by
accelerating the entry of residents into meaningful research pursuits during residency. The USC-StARR Program
will draw the most promising Resident Investigators from the General Surgery, Integrated Vascular Surgery, and
Integrated Cardiothoracic Surgery Residency Programs. We have designed an intensive, 24-month, contiguous
StARR program. The goal of the USC-StARR program is to recruit, train, and mentor a group of exceptional
Resident Investigators in acquiring rigorous research skills, conducting high-impact, clinically relevant research
projects, and launching promising careers as surgeon-scientists in cardiovascular and pulmonary science. Our
program will include two research tracks: 1) Basic and Translational Research and 2) Health Outcomes,
Community Engagement, and Dissemination and Implementation Research. Our goals will be accomplished
through the following specific aims: 1) recruit and train three Resident Investigators annually with the potential
and commitment to become successful surgeon-scientists in cardiovascular or pulmonary science; 2) guide
these Resident Investigators in obtaining more advanced methodological, analytic, and collaborative research
skills appropriate for their level of training; 3) create and support effective, influential, and long-lasting mentor
relationships during and after residency; and 4) guide Resident Investigators in successfully competing for other
forms of clinical and translational research support that will pave the way for them to pursue long-term careers
as surgeon-scientists. A Multi-Program Director structure will provide Administrative and Scientific leadership for
the program. The Resident Investigators will have access to a cadre of carefully selected Research Preceptors
with sustained NIH funding coupled with successful track records of mentoring early career scholars. A group
of four highly dedicated and accomplished senior scientists will serve on the Advisory Committee of the program.
Each Resident Investigator will work with their Research Preceptor, Advisory Committee, and the Scientific
Director to achieve their individual and program goals, to provide independent evaluation of their progress, and
to develop, advise on, and track their Independent Career Development Plan. The impact of this innovative
proposal will be to increase the ability and capacity of the USC General Surgery, Integrated Vascular Surgery,
and Integrated Cardiothoracic Surgery residency training programs to foster the development of surgeon-
scientists in the field of cardiovascular and pulmonary science. Through this program, we will increase the ability
of these surgeon-scientists to transition to other forms of research and career development support."
10923894,"Recent studies, including our own, have shown dramatic increases in selected cancers among young adults.
Using U.S. SEER data, we showed that incidence rates of three key cancers have been increasing in younger
adults in the past decade: 318,781 adults aged 25–49 years were diagnosed with colorectal (n=114,220),
thyroid (n=146,977), and kidney (n=57,584) cancer with increases per year at 2.44%, 4.81%, and 3.83%,
respectively, during 2006–2015. Annual percent change over 1% per year is usually classified as an epidemic
of cancer. Thus, there is urgent public health need to understand the drivers of these early-onset cancers. We
have also modelled age-period-cohort effects and found that risks of developing these three cancers at younger
ages (25–49 years) have increased significantly by birth year for the last several decades. In addition, these
increases were consistently seen in most racial subgroups and in both localized and advanced cancers. These
findings suggest increased risks for these cancers due to increasing extrinsic (i.e., environmental and lifestyle)
risk factors, which, if identified, can be prevented. However, despite the dramatic increases in these early-onset
cancers, their relative rarity coupled with a long induction time make traditional epidemiologic approaches
inefficient to identify the underlying causes. For example, a population sample of more than 0.76 million would
be needed to observe 500 cases of colorectal cancer in adults under 50 over a 5-year period.
We thus propose to utilize a novel, and efficient, mathematical framework to investigate drivers of the three early-
onset cancers (i.e. colorectal, thyroid, and kidney). This framework will use mechanistic mathematical models to
capture the underlying cancer biology over the life course, and further couple these models with advanced data
assimilation methods to test various hypothesized risk mechanisms based on cancer incidence and exposures
recorded in nationally representative datasets. The project team has extensive experience using data
assimilation methods and mathematical models to understand disease systems including cancers. The
framework will also innovatively account for changing cancer detection rates over time, observation errors,
interactions among multiple risk factors, and changes in risk impact over the life course. Using this new
framework, for each of the three key cancers, we aim to 1) systematically examine and identify key risk factors,
in particular, in younger adults <50 years, 2) infer the risk mechanisms (e.g., cancer initiation vs. promotion), 3)
examine the dynamic interactions among co-exposures (e.g., risk amplification due to synergistic effect of co-
exposures), and 4) quantify the impact of individual risk factors and co-exposures in different stages of life and
particularly to examine critical windows of susceptibility. Further, we will quantify whether the identified etiological
factors when combined are of high enough magnitude to be used to develop a risk calculator for starting earlier
cancer screening. Completing these aims will thus provide important etiologic evidence for primary prevention
at the population-level as well as aid clinicians and their patients in devising cancer screening strategies."

U2R Research Training Program (RTP) grant application for DS-I Africa initiative (RFA-RM-20-016) is a
partnership of 3 collaborating institutions: Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL), University of Rwanda
(UR) and African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), both in Kigali, Rwanda. The overarching objective
of U2R RTP is to stimulate and catalyze innovation of Data Science (DS) for Health in Rwanda. A high
prevalence of communicable diseases, coupled with a rapidly expanding epidemic of non-communicable
diseases (NCDs), forecasts a perfect public health storm in Rwanda, providing impetus and rationale to leverage
DS to address health care gaps. A structured program design will help develop trainee research careers in
DS with particular focus on health care topics relevant to Rwanda, including communicable (i.e., HIV,
malaria, COVID-19, etc) and chronic NCDs (i.e., hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, etc). We propose to
expand existing model curriculum for innovative and interdisciplinary DS for Health research training and practice
by identifying additional competencies in three major scientific areas: 1) computer science & informatics; 2)
statistics & mathematics; and 3) biomedical sciences & public health. U2R RTP will: a) provide support
(tuition, stipend, research funds) for 24 trainees: MS (n=14), PhD (n=6); post-doc (n=2); junior faculty (n=2);
each trainee receives training for 1-2 years based on individual needs; b) foster an innovative team science
transdisciplinary approach to research; and c) build institutional capacity at UR and AIMS to support the long-
term sustainability of the program. The intended outcomes are to: 1) train next generation of data scientists
that will have the necessary expertise to solve challenging problems presented by the burden of communicable
and chronic NCDs in Rwanda; and 2) complete a full U2R program leadership and faculty and institutional
transition from US-Rwanda co-led to fully Rwandan-led by the end of the U2R program. Trainees will participate
in mandatory week long “boot camps” (twice/yr), monthly webinars and mid-yr mtg with didactic training focused
on career advice, research and academic advancement in highly-relevant Data Science and health care topics
(i.e., data management, bioinformatics, statistics, epidemiology, communicable diseases, NCDs, environmental
exposure, dissemination and implementation, etc); intense Grant & Manuscript Writing Skills Training
Program geared towards development of competitive grant proposals (“Small Research Projects, SRP)” that
trainees prepare, submit and conduct under direction of a multidisciplinary mentoring team from academic and
governmental institutions. Effective mentoring during boot camp occurs through trainee “Group Brainstorming
Sessions” where they present their developing SRPs to obtain feedback. An extensive program evaluation by
trainees and faculty will also provide feedback for improvement. The U2R RTP will establish and cultivate a
sustainable program for training, research, mentoring and career development that will position UR and AIMS
as national and regional African leaders and a global hub for Data Science for Health in Rwanda."

Acoustic Tweezing Cytometry for Efficient Neural Differentiation
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been hailed as a promising cell source for treating degenerative,
malignant, and genetic diseases, or injuries due to inflammation, infection, and trauma. hPSCs have also been
proven as an invaluable discovery tool to study human development and for developing and testing new drugs.
However, to fully realize the tremendous potential of hPSCs, the first and perhaps the most critical step is the
directed differentiation of hPSCs to specific functional cell types with high efficiency and purity.
 Motor neurons (MNs) are a specialized class of neurons that reside in the spinal cord and project axons
to muscles to control their activity. MNs are damaged in diseases such as spinal cord injury, amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). While there are significant interests in
differentiating hPSCs into functional MNs for cell therapies and understanding of MN degenerative diseases,
poorly defined culture conditions and inefficient protocols of MN differentiation from hPSCs have significantly
hindered their broad use. Given that embryonic development is a dynamic process involving constantly
changing physical environments, the central hypothesis of this proposed research is that hPSCs, which is
equivalent to the epiblast in the peri-implantation human embryo, are intrinsically mechanosensitive, and
biophysical cues in the cell microenvironment can provide potent regulatory signals to control their
differentiation and functional maturation towards specific neuronal subtypes such as MNs. This proposal is
strongly motivated by our exciting preliminary data showing that a novel ultrasound-based technology, acoustic
tweezing cytometry (ATC), which can apply controlled dynamic subcellular mechanical forces to hPSCs, can
indeed elicit neuroepithelial and even MN differentiation of hPSCs much more rapidly compared to
conventional protocols that solely rely on soluble factors. Thus we propose in this research to fully develop the
ATC technology to not only elucidate the intrinsic mechanosensitive properties of hPSCs, but also utilize the
technology to improve large-scale production of functional MNs.
 In this research we propose to (Aim 1) develop high-throughput ATC technology with improved
capability for mechanical stimulation of hPSCs; (Aim 2) elucidate the role of a regulatory network comprising
mechanosensitive pathways (BMP/YAP activity, RhoA/ROCK/cytoskeleton contractility, and Hippo/LATS) in
regulating ATC-facilitated neuroepithelial differentiation of hPSCs; (Aim 3) apply ATC for high-efficiency
functional MN generation from hPSCs. Successful completion of this research will establish a new, novel
approach for hPSC neural differentiation and MN generation, potentially enabling drastic advances in large-
scale production of clinical-grade MNs for cell-based therapies and drug screens. Our proposed research will
also help establish a novel mechanistic framework for understanding mechanosensitive hPSC properties and
will chart a path to unravel their full complexity for their future regenerative medicine applications."
10883770,"Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) affects over 50% of recipients within the first 24-72 hours after lung
transplantation. PGD is the dominant risk for post-lung transplant mortality, transplant-associated multi-organ
dysfunction, and chronic lung allograft rejection. Since lung transplantation is increasingly utilized as a life-saving
treatment for both chronic lung diseases as well as acute respiratory distress syndrome, mitigation of PGD
represents a critical component of a multi-pronged strategy to improve transplant outcomes.
In a prospective clinical study, we found that over 30% of patients undergoing lung transplantation have lung-
restricted autoantibodies (LRA) against self-antigens, collagen type V and k-alpha 1 tubulin, which was strongly
associated with the development of PGD. Pre-existing LRA is associated with complement activation, neutrophil
recruitment, a lower PaO2/FIO2 and worsened lung injury, all clinical hallmarks of PGD. In parallel work, we
identified an important role for donor derived non-classical monocytes (NCM) that are retained in the lung grafts
after perfusion in the development of PGD. Donor derived NCM sense damage associated molecular patterns
(DAMPs) via redundant signaling through TLR2/4 to release CXCL2 and other cytokines that directly recruit
neutrophils to the allograft and activate donor alveolar macrophages to recruit recipient classical monocytes
stored in the spleen. Upon migration to the lung graft, the recipient classical monocytes (CM) permeabilize the
pulmonary endothelium and amplify the extravasation of neutrophils to the alveolar space. Our published and
preliminary data suggest important interactions between LRA, donor derived NCM and recipient derived CM in
determining the severity of lung injury after lung transplantation. Specifically, we found that LRA bind Fc
receptors on donor derived NCM to promote their retention in the allograft and activation. This enhances the
recruitment of CM to the allograft which release IL-1. Permeabilization of the endothelium in response to IL-1
allows LRA access to the lung interstitium and promotes neutrophil migration into the alveolar space. In addition,
CM release matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP8), which cleaves extracellular matrix proteins to release
sequestered self-antigens and expose their immunogenic epitopes, enabling the extravasated LRA to form
immune complexes. The resulting immune complexes activate complement to exacerbate lung injury in the first
24 hours after lung transplantation. Further preliminary data suggest LRA immune complexes activate donor
derived NCM to release CXCL2 and promote neutrophil recruitment via a pathway that requires Src, PI3K and
BTK but is independent of the TLR2/4/MyD88 pathway activated by DAMPs, resulting in delayed lung injury in
the 48 to 72 hours after transplant. We will test the hypothesis that LRA interact with donor derived NCM and
recipient CM to worsen PGD via complement dependent and independent pathways. Aim 1. To determine the
mechanisms through which LRA activate NCM. Aim 2. To determine the role of IL-1 and MMP-8 released
from recipient CM in the cleavage of sequestered self-antigens and their binding to LRA."
10930002,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
In the United States, prostate cancer (PCa) is predicted to be the second leading cause of cancer related
death in men in the United States in 2020. After initial diagnosis of PCa, radical prostatectomy, radiation and
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) are used to treat the primary tumors. When cancer recurs, castrate-
resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is treated by anti-androgen drugs, such as enzalutamide (XTANDI®),
abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA®) or apalutamide (ERLEADA™). Although these drugs are highly effective initially,
patients quickly develop resistance through mechanisms that are not completely understood. Therefore, there
is an urgent need to identify resistant mechanisms to improve the treatment outcome of CRPC. Protein
homeostasis (proteostasis) deficiency and oncogenic activation plays important roles during tumorigenesis;
however, proteostasis modulation involved in anti-androgen resistant PCa is still rudimentarily understood. We
have reported that ubiquitin mediated proteolysis pathway and proteasome activity are suppressed in
enzalutamide and abiraterone resistant PCa cells. As a result, androgen receptor (AR) and its variant form AR-
V7 protein are stabilized and accumulated in these resistant cells through chaperone-ubiquitin-proteasome-
system alteration. The chaperone (Hsp70)/E3 ubiquitin ligase (Stub1) machinery regulates full length AR and
AR variant proteostasis. Hsp70 inhibition by small molecules promotes Hsp70, AR-V7 and Stub1 proximity
which significantly disrupts AR/AR-V7 gene programs and suppresses prostate tumor growth. This proposal
initiates a new paradigm to explore the underlying mechanisms driving next generation anti-androgen
resistance in CRPC. The ultimate goal of this program is to dissect the roles of chaperone-ubiquitin-
proteasome-system in anti-androgen resistance and develop new pharmaceutical approaches to provide co-
targeting neoadjuvant with anti-AR agents to personalized CRPC patients’ treatment. We will provide a novel
mechanism of next generation anti-androgen resistance via proteostasis impairment and uncover that
Hsp70/Stub1 machinery in anti-androgen resistant CRPC may trigger accumulation of oncogenic proteins such
as AR variants and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) due to inability of protein clearance. We will functionally
interrogate the Hsp70/Stub1/AR-V7 ternary complex through biochemical assays, and uncover the
mechanisms of inhibition of Hsp70 activity in inducing AR-V7 degradation through the proximity of Stub1. We
will unveil the underlying mechanisms of AR and AR-V7 ubiquitination through the ubiquitination binding sites
identification and large-scale ubiquitin remnants sequencing. Importantly, we will provide the rationale to
correct proteostasis imbalance through modulation of Hsp70/Stub1 as a potential therapeutic strategy to
overcome resistance to AR-targeted therapies in CRPC patients and develop conditional reprogramed cell
cultures (CRCs) and patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to dissect the mechanisms in vivo. This proposal
will fill the gap in overcoming next generation anti-androgen resistance in CRPC patients and point the way to
future research by improving current AR-targeted therapies."

The combinational antiretroviral therapy is effective in suppressing HIV-1 replication. However,
latent HIV reservoirs cannot be cleared by such antiretroviral therapy, as viral rebound develops
rapidly after the treatment is interrupted in people living with HIV. The shock-and-kill approach to
eliminate HIV-1 reservoirs is to induce viral reactivation using latency reversal agents and trigger
cell death through virus-mediated cytopathic effects or immune-mediated clearance. However,
shock-and-kill by latency reversal agents has not been shown to successfully reduce the viral
reservoirs in HIV-1 patients. It has been reported that latency reversal agents can up-regulate
pro-survival autophagy and anti-apoptotic molecules that counteract cell death signaling.
Inhibition of these pro-survival mechanisms can promote the killing of HIV-1-infected cells, and
facilitate the killing of HIV-1 reservoir cells during vial re-activation. Experiments are proposed to
test hypothesis that cellular mechanisms that maintain the long-term persistence of HIV-1
reservoirs are important for protecting the reservoir cells against cell death, and targeting these
cellular mechanisms can sensitize HIV-1 reservoirs to cell death during viral reactivation: 1) To
determine the mechanisms for the specific induction of cell death in HIV-1 reservoirs in response
to viral reactivation. The mechanisms for the induction of apoptosis and alternative cell death
pathways in latent HIV-infected T cells by latency reversal agents will be tested; 2) To delineate
the mechanisms that confer the resistance to cell death in HIV-1 reservoirs upon viral reactivation;
and 3) To test whether targeting pro-survival mechanisms sensitizes HIV-1 reservoirs cells to cell
death during viral re-activation. The studies will reveal novel molecular pathways that could be
targeted to sensitize HIV-1 reservoirs to cell death, and facilitate the development of an effective
approach to clear HIV-1 reservoirs."

More than half of traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCI) occur at the cervical level, leading to
paralysis and respiratory compromise or failure. Approximately 20% of cSCI patients will require
ventilator support for which there are very few therapeutic options for recovery. Epidural
stimulation has emerged as a strategy to restore a variety of motor, sensory, and autonomic
functions in both experimental and clinical conditions after SCI. Though limited underlying
mechanisms have been proposed, to date little is known how epidural stimulation elicits motor
function at the neuronal level. Even less is known about the capacity for epidural stimulation to
promote long-lasting spinal plasticity for true device-independence and to date no studies have
explored the potential for eliciting respiratory plasticity. The fundamental hypothesis guiding this
proposal is that long-term, closed-loop epidural stimulation elicits functional improvement in
diaphragm activity that outlasts the period of stimulation via activity-dependent mechanisms
involving BDNF/TrkB signaling in phrenic motor neurons. Preliminary data are promising and
indicate at least some short-term plasticity with longer periods of stimulation (4d). We envision
that more chronic and targeted stimulation parameters will result in longer persistence of motor
recovery. This is the first study to propose chronic epidural stimulation in awake, freely-behaving
animals in a defined respiratory neural circuit. Ultimately, data from this project will serve to
inform development of future investigations of the mechanistic basis of epidural stimulation
efficacy essential for advancing the therapeutic applications to many motor systems but
especially to the neural system controlling breathing."
10906014,"Project Summary/Abstract
 We investigate how neuronal primary cilia regulate energy homeostasis and how
their dysregulation causes obesity. Primary cilia are cell surface projections that receive
and transduce select intercellular signals. In humans, disruption of primary cilia function
causes ciliopathies, pleiotropic diseases of which obesity is a cardinal manifestation. The
most common monogenic cause of severe human obesity is mutation of MC4R, encoding
a hypothalamic GPCR that regulates energy homeostasis.
 In the initial funding period of this project, we have demonstrated that MC4R
localizes and functions at the primary cilia in vivo, and that its localization and function are
dependent on the MC4R-associated protein MRAP2. We also found that inhibiting
adenylyl cyclase in the primary cilia of MC4R neurons causes obesity. These findings
suggest that hypothalamic neurons use cilia to communicate through MC4R to regulate
energy homeostasis.
 Here, we build on these findings, and on new genetic and molecular tools we have
developed, to investigate how ciliopathies disrupt ciliary MC4R signaling, how the ligands
of MC4R regulate its localization to cilia, and how MC4R activity is transduced by the
cilium. Together, these experiments will illuminate how cilia signaling encodes long-term
energy homeostasis and how neurons use cilia to communicate non-synaptically."

Hispanic/Latinx (henceforth, Latinx) adults currently have a 50% greater risk for Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias (ADRD) compared to non-Latinx White adults. Latinx populations experience greater social,
environmental, and economic disadvantage that heightens psychosocial stress, increasing vulnerability for
poor cognitive health outcomes. Perceived ethnic discrimination is a psychosocial stressor that reflects
individual experiences of being treated badly or unfairly because of their ethnicity, and may be a critical risk
factor for reduced cognitive health. Latinxs in the U.S. are diverse in multiple ways warranting a within
population study of Latinxs. Mexican-origin adults constitute 62% of the Latinx population in the U.S. Thus,
evaluating risk and protective factors in Mexican-origin adults will elucidate mechanisms of cognitive health
inequities in the largest portion of the Latinx U.S. population. Midlife is a critical time to evaluate precursors of
disparate cognitive health outcomes in late life and identifying predictors of cognitive health in this
developmental stage can inform early prevention and intervention efforts. The proposed research will uncover
how perceived ethnic discrimination is associated with cognitive function in Mexican-origin adults in midlife by
implementing a within day, ecological momentary assessment, protocol to measure discrimination and
cognitive functioning throughout the day. This R21 study will break new ground in understanding increased risk
of ADRD within the Latinx population by examining cognitive functioning associated with discrimination when it
occurs in daily life, by incorporating linguistically and culturally appropriate ambulatory assessments of daily
experiences and cognition using mobile devices. The proposed protocol will be inclusive and accessible on the
language of surveys and assessments used, and will accommodate baseline data collection settings to garner
inclusivity and reduce selection bias in this area of research. Study investigators will collect data from 100
Mexican-origin adults between the ages of 45 to 65 who live in Central Texas, to test the aims of the study.
Aim 1 will evaluate daily associations between experiences of discrimination and performance on cognitive
tasks of attention and memory. This aim will also test if the observed links vary across age. Aim 2 will test
psychological mechanisms (e.g., increased negative affect) from experiences of discrimination to cognitive
functioning. Aim 3 will investigate psychosocial sources of resilience in the association between experiences of
discrimination and cognitive function in Mexican-origin adults by testing the moderating role of individual
differences in psychological (e.g., purpose in life) and social (e.g., familism) resources. This study will increase
understanding of risk and protective factors for reduced cognitive health among Mexican-origin adults—a
priority sub-population in the National Institute on Aging’s Health Disparities Research Framework—to inform
future prevention and intervention efforts aimed at promoting healthy cognitive aging in Latinx adults."
10795920,"ABSTRACT
For 70 years, the primary treatment for hydrocephalus has focused on cerebrospinal fluid shunt (CSF) derivation,
which is performed to release the increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Unfortunately, CSF shunts malfunction
at an unacceptable rate; 98% of patients suffer shunt failure in their lifetime, with obstruction of the ventricular
catheter as the leading cause of failure in pediatric hydrocephalus. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms
that underlie shunt blockage has become essential for pediatric neurosurgeons. Currently, there are only a few
biological systems (bioreactors) that test ventricular catheters. However, these bioreactors fail to mimic the
hydrocephalic pathology since they do not consider ICP, which is the main symptom that the shunts are meant
to treat. The bioreactors developed to date are also cytologically limited since they do not consider ventricular
zone (VZ) cells or choroid plexus (ChP). Thus, our central hypothesis is that inflammatory-dependent VZ glial
activation and ChP proliferation play a fundamental role in the process of shunt obstruction. To test this
hypothesis, our group is developing a unique in vitro bioreactor that mimics the cytopathology of
hydrocephalus. The bioreactor is designed to test cellular obstruction in different ventricular catheters under
normal and pathological conditions, with the capacity to modulate pressure and catheter flow. Three specific aims
will test this hypothesis: (1) Validate our in vitro bioreactor to test catheters in normal-pressure conditions; (2)
Test our in vitro bioreactor under high-pressure conditions; (3) Test available proximal catheters for
susceptibility to obstruction and provide valuable clinical information to neurosurgeons. We will use our recently
developed in vitro model as an ideal experimental platform to mimic the cytopathology of hydrocephalus, and
we will leverage our experience with ChP organ cultures, in combination with this unique bioreactor, to provide
a comprehensive understanding of ventricular catheter obstruction under hydrocephalic conditions."
10816576,"PROJECT SUMMARY: This R21 project will develop new classes of synthetic liquid-infused surfaces and
coatings that prevent bacterial fouling and attenuate bacterial virulence in clinical and healthcare settings.
These objectives will be accomplished by the pursuit of two focused and integrated Aims: (1) to explore new
designs of slippery nanoemulsion-infused porous surfaces (SNIPS) and characterize the impacts of infused
nanoemulsions on antifouling behavior, including the ability to prevent fouling by bacterial pathogens, and (2)
to design SNIPS that can host and release active agents and characterize the ability of drug-eluting SNIPS to
enhance prevention of surface biofouling and attenuate bacterial load and virulence.
 Contamination and fouling of surfaces by bacteria pose persistent and costly threats in many industrial,
commercial, and clinical healthcare settings. These problems are urgent, and the potential societal and
economic impacts of strategies to prevent bacterial fouling and virulence are nearly impossible to overstate.
Many strategies have been used to design materials that resist bacterial fouling, but all of them ultimately fail
when deployed in real-world scenarios. Fundamentally new approaches to the design of antifouling or `anti-
virulence' surfaces that move beyond conventional design strategies are desperately needed and would have
substantial impacts on human health.
 One promising approach to prevent bacterial fouling on surfaces is to exploit the properties of `slippery'
liquid-infused porous surfaces. These so-called `SLIPS' have enormous potential in healthcare settings, but are
generally passive materials—they can strongly repel bacteria with which they come into contact, but can do
little to attenuate the virulent behaviors of organisms in surrounding environments or reduce microbial load.
This proposal seeks to advance innovative designs of `drug-eluting' SLIPS that can address this challenge and,
thereby, enhance inherent anti-biofouling properties by eluting antimicrobial and anti-virulence agents.
 The proposed work is based on two broad propositions: (i) that infusion of water-in-oil nanoemulsions,
rather than conventional hydrophobic oils, into porous polymer coatings can be used to design `slippery'
antifouling materials (`SNIPS') that can host and release bioactive agents, and (ii) that SNIPS containing potent
antibiotics and novel anti-virulence agents can reduce bacterial loads and alter bacterial behaviors in ways that
enhance inherent anti-biofouling behaviors and expand the practical utility of liquid-infused materials. Our
innovative and cross-disciplinary research plan seeks to explore these new ideas and test hypotheses that will
create a foundation for the development of new synthetic polymer coatings that can prevent bacterial fouling in
practical settings. The scope of the proposed studies embodies novel questions and associated levels of risk
that are appropriate for an R21-level study and unites a team of established and actively collaborating
investigators to demonstrate and explore the feasibility of this new materials-focused approach."
10821463,"Abstract
Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) remains a devastating disease affecting approximately 30,000
adults in the United States per year. Forty percent of aSAH patients die within 30 days, and over one-third of
survivors sustain major neurologic deficits, in part due to feared secondary complications like vasospasm and
delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). Despite advances in care, few interventions can mitigate the risk of neurologic
worsening after the initial bleed, and current monitoring strategies to identify impending DCI have limited
accuracy. Abnormalities in cerebrovascular autoregulation and flow-metabolism uncoupling in the acute phase
after aSAH have been shown to increase the risk of secondary brain injury and likely represent key players in
the development of DCI. In this proposal, we plan to develop and refine an innovative, personalized approach to
blood pressure management to identify patients most likely to benefit from therapeutic BP manipulation. To carry
out this overarching aim, we will track continuous recordings of intracranial pressure, near-infrared spectroscopy,
and EEG to determine patient-specific blood pressure targets that yield optimal brain blood flow and metabolism.
This research proposal will evaluate if cerebral hemodynamic dysregulation drives EEG deterioration (Aim 1)
and if a deviation from optimized blood pressure targets is associated with DCI and poor outcomes (Aim 2). We
will then prospectively validate our results in a pilot cohort study. This proposal’s feasibility rests on (1) several
years of research conducted by the principal investigators on signal processing, autoregulatory physiology, and
continuous EEG in disease states like SAH and ischemic stroke, and (2) promising preliminary analyses
evaluating the hypotheses being explored in this proposal. In total, this autoregulation-oriented neuroprotective
therapy aims to optimize cerebral perfusion and ultimately improve clinical and functional outcomes. This
research proposal is thus directly aligned with the NIH mission to reduce the burden of neurological disorders
and enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities. The study will leverage Yale’s cutting-edge neuro-
monitoring technologies along with extensive informatics and research resources of the Yale Center for Clinical
Investigation to generate new insights into cerebral hemodynamics after aSAH and identify treatment
opportunities. This line of research is readily translatable to the bedside and also applies to other cerebrovascular
diseases like intracerebral hemorrhage and ischemic stroke, both of which likely encompass dysautoregulation
as a critical physiologic variable. Knowledge gained in this study is anticipated to lead to a significant shift in the
treatment approach for aSAH patients. It may ultimately lead to a clinical trial testing autoregulation-based
treatment strategies, including tailored pharmacologic BP modulation based on patients’ real-time autoregulatory
status. Our long-term goal is to use neuro-monitoring to develop physiology-based, personalized, early
interventions to reduce the disability and morbidity associated with neurologic injury."
10844644,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This K99/R00 proposal will test a critical hypothesis on how vasopressin (VP) neurons self-regulate their neuronal
excitability, their local paracrine release of vasopressin, and how these mechanisms are altered in a rodent model of
heart failure while providing the PI with additional scientific and professional skills to transition him to a successful
independent career as a research professor.
Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of death worldwide. A hallmark of HF is sympathetic hyperactivity and increased
circulating levels of neurohormones such as VP. The slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) is recognized as a key mechanism
that influences VP firing, playing a critical role in shaping the stereotyped phasic bursting patterns in VP neurons. The
sAHP is impaired in VP HF neurons. Uniquely, Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of VP occurs somatodendritically (VP-SDR) as
well, acting in a paracrine manner as an auto-inhibitory feedback mechanism. It is currently unknown whether VP-SDR is
impaired in VP HF neurons. Data presented herein shows sAHPs and VP-SDR share many common signaling pathways
which have been observed separately but never in tandem. Furthermore, we have exciting preliminary data that demonstrates
VP itself can enhance isolated sAHPs, suggesting that endogenous VP-SDR may modulate sAHP time course, and thus
firing activity. Understanding how these mechanisms lead to aberrant VP neuronal activity in HF is of critical importance.
I therefore present the unique hypothesis that sAHP and VP-SDR activation are not only activated by the same
signaling and pathways, but that VP-SDR can directly modulate sAHPs. I hypothesize that the observed impairment
of the sAHP in HF neurons reflects impaired intracellular Ca2+ signaling and VP-SDR, leading to the
hyperexcitability and excess peripheral VP release observed in this condition. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that certain
modes of VP activation (ex. continuous vs. phasic stimulation) favors the activation of either sAHPs or VP-SDR. Aim 2
will test the hypothesis that endogenous VP-SDR itself modulates sAHPs. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that intracellular
Ca2+ sensitivity/availability and VP-SDR are impaired in VP neurons of HF rats. This proposal will significantly enhance
the PI’s career development and advance him towards his goal of becoming an independent investigator. The proposed
project provides training in technical skills and professional development with an emphasis on independence and acquiring
skills needed to run a laboratory. We will accomplish this by uniquely integrating previously mastered techniques in a novel
way to measure sAHPs and VP-SDR simultaneously via patch clamp and utilization of VP detecting “sniffer” cells,
respectively from healthy and HF rats. Georgia State University also provides an exceptional environment for training with
the facilities and equipment needed to perform the research, an intellectual environment of seminars and workshops,
ongoing collaborations both within and outside the institution, and most critically a mentoring senior PI with a wealth of
experience preparing postdocs for an independent career. Indeed, the mentor has provided an explicit plan to actively prepare
the PI for independence. In summary, this proposal will provide the training necessary to prepare the applicant for
independence while making a significant contribution to our understanding of VP neurons in a prevalent disease."
10909843,"Background: Evidence-based practices (EBPs) are the most high value treatments to meet Veterans’
addiction and mental health needs, reduce chronic impairment, and prevent suicide or overdose. Over 10
years, VA invested in dissemination of evidence-based psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies based on
substantial evidence of effectiveness as compared to usual care. Quality metrics also track progress.
Despite these investments, patients with prevalent needs, such as depression, PTSD and opioid use
disorder often don’t receive EBPs. Systems theory explains limited EBP reach as a system behavior
emerging dynamically from local components (e.g., patient demand/health service supply). Participatory
research and engagement principles guide participatory system dynamics (PSD), a mixed-methods
approach used in business and engineering, shown to be effective for improving quality with existing
resources. Significance/Impact: We propose our study in the high priority area of VA addiction and mental
health care to improve Veteran access to VA’s highest quality care. Our PSD program, Modeling to Learn
(MTL), improves frontline management of dynamic complexity through simulations of staffing, scheduling
and service referrals common in healthcare, across generalist and specialty programs, patient populations,
and provider disciplines/treatments. Innovation: Recent synthesis of VA data in the enterprise-wide SQL
Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) makes it feasible to scale participatory simulation learning activities with
VA frontline addiction and mental health staff. MTL is an advanced quality improvement (QI) infrastructure
that helps VA take a major step toward becoming a learning health care system, by empowering local
multidisciplinary staff to develop change strategies that fit to local capacities and constraints. Model
parameters are from one VA source and generic across health services. If findings show that MTL is
superior to usual VA quality improvement activities of data review with facilitators from VA program offices,
this paradigm could prove useful across VA services. The PSD approach also advances implementation
science. Systems theory explains how dynamic system behaviors (EBP reach) are defined by general
scientific laws, yet arise from idiographic local conditions. Empowering staff with systems science simulation
encourages the safe prototyping of ideas necessary for learning, increasing ongoing quality improvement
capacities, and saving time and money as compared to trial-and-error approaches. Specific Aims: 1.
Effectiveness: Test for superiority of MTL over usual QI for increasing the proportion of patients (1a)
initiating, and (1b) completing a course of evidence-based psychotherapy (EBPsy) and evidence-based
pharmacotherapy (EBPharm). 2. Scalable: (2a) Evaluate usual QI and MTL fidelity. (2b) Test MTL fidelity for
convergent validity with participatory measures. (2c) Test the participatory theory of change: Evaluate
whether 12 month period EBP reach is mediated by team scores on participatory measures. 3. Affordable:
(3a) Determine the budget impact of MTL. (3b). Calculate the average marginal costs per 1% increase in
EBP reach. Methodology: We propose a two-arm, 24-clinic (12 per arm) cluster randomized trial to test for
superiority of MTL over usual QI for increasing EBP reach. Clinics will be from 24 regional health care
systems (HCS) below the SAIL mental health median, and low on 3 of 8 SAIL measures associated with
EBPs. Computer-assisted stratified block randomization will balance MTL and usual QI arms at baseline
using Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) data. Participants will be the multidisciplinary frontline teams of
addiction and mental health providers. Next Steps/Implementation: MTL was developed in partnership
with the VA Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention (OMHSP) and if shown to be effective, scalable,
and affordable for improving timely Veteran access to EBPs, MTL will be scaled nationally to more clinics by
expanding MTL online resources, and training more VA staff to facilitate MTL activities instead of usual QI."

10873164,"ABSTRACT – RESEARCH EDUCATION COMPONENT
The overall goal of the Research Education Component (REC) is to develop high quality investigators engaged
in transformative interdisciplinary research on the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention
of Alzheimer’s dementia and related dementias (AD/ADRD). Recent advances, particularly the application of
high throughput biochemical and molecular techniques and novel approaches to integrate multilevel and
multiethnic data, offer an unprecedented opportunity for scientific progress but also pose unique challenges for
investigators engaged in aging research. Optimization of emerging methodologies in high impact research
requires talented scientists capable of sharing knowledge and methodologies across disciplines. Truly
interdisciplinary research can be difficult to accomplish, however. Barriers include limited shared knowledge
among investigators from diverse disciplines and changing dynamics in the field; junior investigators
increasingly hold expertise in emerging methodologies but may lack a full appreciation of their potential to
address critical gaps in knowledge, and senior investigators with a deep understanding of these gaps may be
unfamiliar with emerging methodologies. New integrative and multidirectional learning opportunities (i.e.,
learning flows from investigators of all levels across disciplines and institutions) are needed to facilitate efficient
knowledge transfer and productive partnership among diverse investigators. The REC will capitalize on a
highly multidisciplinary faculty and implement an integrative and multidirectional approach to facilitate truly
interdisciplinary aging research with a focus on emerging methodologies and high priority areas such as health
disparities. Toward this end, the REC will provide cross-disciplinary training in key disciplines relevant to aging
and link this to new training in emerging methodologies and health disparities research using the highly unique
clinical, biologic and biospecimen data generated at Rush. The REC will work with all other Rush ADRC Cores
to implement and oversee a variety of educational activities, including 1) a monthly Neuroepidemiology of
Aging Seminar; 2) intensive mini-internship training in emerging methodologies and health disparities, 3)
individualized mentoring, and 4) participation in the RADC annual Aging Research Forum. Via careful
integration with the other Rush ADRC Cores, the REC will develop highly skilled interdisciplinary investigators
capable of leveraging contemporary approaches in high impact and innovative AD/ADRD research."
10799651,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is an abnormal connection between an artery and vein that bypasses the
normal capillary circulation, resulting in a tangle of vessels called a nidus. The malformation results in excessive
stress on the venous wall, and can cause the rupturing of overstressed veins. Brain AVMs are particularly
concerning since brain hemorrhage has the most severe complications, including seizures and neurologic
deficits. The mortality rate after brain AVM rupture ranges from 12%-66.7%, and 23%-40% of survivors have
significant disability. Furthermore, localized inflammation is found to be responsible for brain AVM progression
and rupture. Anti-inflammatory drug therapy may, therefore, be a possibility to stabilize brain AVMs. Current
treatment for brain AVMs includes microsurgery, embolization and radiosurgery. In embolization, which is the
focus of this work, liquid embolic agents are delivered through catheters to embolize upstream or within the AVM
shunt, aiming to return venous pressure to normal. The main challenge in embolizing AVMs stems from the
difficulty involved with adequately penetrating the dense, tortuous and low resistance nidus. Proximal occlusion
leads to the development of collateral vessels, promoting angiogenesis. Therefore, blockage of both nidus and
the feeding arteries is essential for successful embolization. Current FDA approved embolic systems for brain
AVM embolization include Onyx and n-butyl cyanoacrylate. Both are liquid embolic agents that undergo liquid-
solid transition once in contact of blood. They are intended to travel distally from the site of release to penetrate
fine vasculature. Despite clinical availability, both liquids have significant drawbacks and cannot serve as curative
treatment of AVM. Limitations include toxicity from organic solvents, difficulty in delivery, danger of being washed
away, lack of universality to block wide range of vasculature sizes, no intrinsic radiopacity for visualization on X-
ray, and lack of therapeutics. In this proposal, we will develop gel embolic agent as a minimally invasive platform
that is biocompatible, imageable, durable, hemostatic and anti-inflammatory to embolize and stabilize AVMs. We
posit that gel embolic agents containing natural crosslinker, genipin, will 1) offer flexibility to penetrate different
AVM geometries/sizes, 2) enhance mechanical robustness of the clot-gel system in embolized AVMs to prevent
migration, and 3) serve as an anti-inflammatory therapy for AVM stabilization. In Aim 1, we will develop different
gel compositions for effective embolization. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the gel’s mechanical properties, injectability
and in vitro occlusion ability to optimize occlusion capability. Lastly in Aim 3, we will study the biological properties
of the gels in vitro using relevant cell lines for biosafety evaluation and therapeutic characterization. Successful
completion of this study will show that therapeutic gel embolic agents can be used safely and occlude effectively
with therapeutic characteristics. This pilot study will set the stage for further in vivo testing in large animal studies
using clinically relevant AVM models. We envision that this embolization platform can be widely disseminated to
other applications, such as venous hypertension, aneurysms, and tumor embolization."
10842341,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Potentially curative treatments for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are limited to intensive systemic
chemotherapy with or without allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). However, not every patient is
healthy enough to tolerate intensive treatments, and not every patient may have a suitably HLA-matched stem
cell donor, especially patients from ethnic minority groups. Targeted agents have recently been approved to
treat AML, but these usually require intensive systemic chemotherapy to optimize efficacy. Furthermore, AML
is genetically heterogeneous with distinct genetic mutations and chromosomal alterations that makes targeted-
agent monotherapy unlikely to be curative. AML, like most hematologic malignancies, is very sensitive to
radiation therapy but even involved field radiation may be too toxic and ineffective for disseminated systemic
disease. However, radioimmunotherapy (RIT) mitigates the off-target toxicity by using monoclonal antibodies
conjugated to radioactive isotopes to deliver radiation payloads directly to sites of disease by virtue of the
antibody specificity. We have shown that RIT using 90Y- and 131I-radiolabeled anti-CD45 antibody targets
radiation to sites of leukemia while minimizing radiation to uninvolved organs. We have improved upon our
approach without increasing toxicity by targeting higher energy alpha-emitting radionuclides (astatine-211;
211At) to sites of disease and by developing a pre-targeted RIT (PRIT) approach using bispecific antibodies
targeting CD45 and 90Y-DOTA.
Using preclinical murine models, we now propose to identify synergistic combinations of 211At- and 90Y-anti-
CD45 RIT with novel targeted therapies that interfere with DNA repair or promote apoptosis. We will do this by
first assessing for synergy between alpha- or beta-emitting radionuclides (211At- and 90Y-) employed in anti-
CD45 directly labeled RIT with recently approved targeted agents (PARP and BCL2 inhibitors) in both
disseminated syngeneic and xenograft leukemia murine models. Second, we will improve therapeutic efficacy
of anti-CD45 PRIT via bispecific antibody constructs targeting CD45 and 90Y-DOTA by assessing for synergy
with targeted therapies (PARP and BCL2 inhibitors) in leukemia murine models. We will characterize the extent
of DNA damage achieved with these two approaches as a means to elucidate the mechanism of efficacy.
Finally, we will compare these two approaches as part of conditioning prior to allogeneic BMT using
haploidentical, or partially matched donors, as all patients should have haploidentical donors.
These preclinical studies should readily translate into clinical trials given our infrastructure for NIH funded and
pharmaceutical-sponsored clinical trials, using anti-CD45 RIT prior to bone marrow transplantation for
aggressive hematologic malignancies. These studies will add effective, well-tolerated treatment options for
patients with AML by identifying synergistic combinations of targeted agents with anti-CD45 RIT approaches
and by identifying the optimal RIT approach prior to haploidentical BMT."
10916399,"Abdominal pain is the main symptom in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that is the most
common gastrointestinal disorder affecting 14-20% of the US population. More than 40% of patients with IBS
regularly use opioid narcotics. Currently no adequate therapies are available for pain in patients with IBS.
 Acupuncture or electroacupuncture (EA) has been shown to be effective for pain management and may have
a potential for treating pain against opioid crisis; however, it has drawbacks of infrequent administration, lack of
optimization in methodology and unclear mechanisms. In this study, we propose a noninvasive method of
transcutaneous electrical acustimulation (TEA) by replacing needles with surface electrodes and by choosing a
few acupoints in the vicinity of peripheral nerves. The proposed TEA is based on a number of previous basic
mechanistic researches and clinical studies. Methodologically, two effective sets of stimulation parameters and
two effective acupoints have been derived for treating visceral hypersensitivity. Mechanistically, appropriate TEA
has been shown to improve autonomic functions that are impaired in IBS. Clinically, the proposed TEA can be
self-administrated at home/work and therefore daily treatment is feasible, which greatly improves its efficacy.
 During the UG3 phase, an existing TEA device will be modified for treating chronic abdominal pain in IBS.
First, a special cellphone app will be developed 1) to keep a history of each treatment, which is critical in
assessing therapy compliance, and 2) to collect and store major treatment outcomes daily and weekly, and
transit these information (de-identified) to a server automatically; this will minimize missing or loss of critical
treatment outcome information and will be useful for future data mining and therapy refinement. Secondly, an
acute clinical physiological test will be performed to derive best stimulation locations and parameters.
 During the UH3 phase, an early feasibility clinical study will be performed in 160 patients with IBS. While the
primary aim is to investigate the therapeutic potential of the proposed TEA in treating abdominal pain in IBS, the
study is also designed to identify subgroups of patients (mild pain vs. moderate pain; constipation vs. diarrhea)
who may respond to TEA for a future large scale clinical study and to compare the analgesic effect and autonomic
mechanisms between the electrical neuromodulation therapy (TEA) and a medical neuromodulation therapy
(pharmacological neuromodulators).
 A comprehensive team has been assembled, including experts in neuromodulation, abdominal pain, IBS,
device development and regulatory affairs. The project results from a close collaboration between a strong
academic center in managing visceral pain and IBS, and a start-up company devoted to bringing the proposed
novel therapy to patients and hospitals."

An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has claimed millions of lives and disrupted
social infrastructures around the world. Fortunately, the new mRNA vaccines from Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech
are highly effective against SARS-CoV-2. However, much remains unknown about the longevity of memory
responses generated by the new mRNA-based vaccine platform in humans. With the emergence of new viral
variants, there is also the need to have a flexible type of immunologic memory that is not only long-lasting but
can also respond to mutated viruses. My lab studies human T cell memory. We have shown that the human
pre-immune T cell repertoire for a novel pathogen is shaped by past antigen experiences and contains cross-
reactive memory T cells that could compete with naïve T cells. Using a highly effective live attenuated yellow
fever virus (YFV) vaccine as a model for novel infectious challenge, we tested how pre-immune repertoire
impacts post-vaccine response. Multiple YFV-specific populations were identified longitudinally within the same
individual using peptide-MHC (pMHC) tetramers. Extensive single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing on
tetramer+ cells was used to follow progenies of the same parent cells over time. We found that vaccine
selectively recruits initially rare but more responsive T cells, leading to better repertoire fitness and higher TCR
diversity after vaccination. Having a diverse TCR repertoire has been directly linked to protective T cell
responses and host survival in mice. For fast evolving pathogens, the diversity in T cell composition may
additionally limit escape variants as mutations emerge. Here, we will use the mRNA vaccines for COVID-19
(COVID vaccines) as a model to study the durability and the breadth of T cell responses elicited by mRNA-
based vaccine strategies. We hypothesize that effective peripheral T cell selection is critical for
maintaining durable immunity against actively mutating viruses. Here we will build on established
biological insights, resources, and donor recruitment infrastructures to determine: (1) if COVID vaccine drives
effective repertoire selection and diversification, (2) how boosting enhances CD4+ T cell diversity and variant
recognition, and (3) how post-vaccine memory cells are maintained and change with time. The proposed
experiments will map the entire trajectory of vaccine-induced response using precise molecular and cellular
tools. Data from this study will provide vital knowledge on the quality, the breadth, and the longevity of CD4+ T
cell response to the mRNA vaccines in humans. Beyond COVID, insights revealed by the proposed research
will be relevant for understanding how immunological memory is generated and preserved. The proposed
research will therefore have broad impact and could aid future development of improved vaccine strategies for
other pathogens."

Project Summary:
Accelerating scientific discoveries across the entire spectrum of pediatric research requires advancing our
current understanding of the unique molecular profiles and physiologies in all healthy tissues across the human
body. The developmental Genotype-Tissue Expression (dGTEx) project will establish the first comprehensive
public resource correlating gene expression and genetic variation in pediatric tissues from all major organ
systems in the human body. This project will identify the molecular profiles in ~30 distinct tissue types from four
developmental groups: Early post-natal, Early childhood, Pre-pubertal, and Post-pubertal. dGTEx will capitalize
on new emerging methodologies to capture detailed evaluations on the developing brain and include options for
single cell analysis on multiple tissues. To advance our understanding of the Ethical, Legal, Social Implications
(ELSI) in pediatric tissue donation, dGTEx also includes an ELSI study to analyze these factors.
The data from dGTEx will provide an unrivaled research resource for clinicians and scientists to gain new insights
on the molecular milestones of regulatory processes that direct the development of healthy tissues. To support
the advancement of dGTEx, this proposal will establish the pediatric Biospecimen Procurement Center (BPC) to
provide the pediatric Laboratory Data Analysis Collection Center (LDACC) with suitable tissue samples for their
analysis. Our proposal includes a multi-institutional effort with extensive expertise in pediatric recoveries,
research, pathology, imaging, biobanking, brain research, and cutting-edge molecular techniques, such as single
cell analysis. The objectives for our BPC recovery team will be led by a collaborative effort amongst: 1) National
Disease Research Interchange (NDRI) to provide project management and coordinate the recovery collection
effort from a network of TSS, 2) Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) to process, store, and coordinate
pathological review of all non-brain tissues and manage the bioinformatics workflow, and 3) NeuroBiobank at
University of Maryland (NBB-Maryland) to process, store, and provide pathological review of brains. This breadth
of expertise is essential for the BPC to provide well-annotated, suitable biospecimens to enable reliable and
reproducible results from the LDACC's cutting-edge experimental methods and rigorous data interpretations.
Improving our understanding of ELSI-specific challenges in pediatric tissue donation is an unmet need for the
research community. To enable a more complete analysis of these challenges, Johns Hopkins All Children's
Hospital (JHACH) will coordinate the dGTEx ELSI study to include evaluations of Tissue Requesters (TRs) and
Family Decision Makers (FDMs) of Deceased and At-Risk Children. Collectively, our BPC team is committed
to developing an all-encompassing, unparalleled BPC for the dGTEx project to empower the advancement of
pediatric research, ELSI challenges, and the development of new clinical approaches to treat pediatric disorders.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia without effective treatments, underscoring the
need for a better understanding of AD pathogenesis. Longitudinal studies in autosomal dominant and sporadic
AD have demonstrated that pathology begins 10-20 years before clinical symptoms, but developmental effects
of AD-associated genetic variants likely provide a substrate for future neuropathological changes. Many AD
causal GWAS variants are associated with genes involved in endolysosomal pathways in glia. However, how
these causal genes are affecting cellular mechanisms has to be further investigated to tackle the disease. One
of the important questions is whether these endolysosomal pathway genes converge on ideally one clear
phenotype that can be targeted for therapeutics. Among others, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the most significant
risk for late-onset AD—homozygosity for the risk allele APOE ɛ4 (APOE 44) increases AD risk by more than 15-
fold. To comprehensively assess the effect of human APOE4 on human brain cell types, we characterized the
APOE4 genotype-phenotype relationship in four brain cell types: microglia, astrocytes, brain microvascular
endothelial cells and mixed cortical cultures derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Global
transcriptome analyses and in vitro mechanism study reveal that human APOE 44 astrocytes sequester
cholesterol in lysosomes, leading to upregulated cholesterol biosynthesis despite elevated intracellular
cholesterol. Our data suggests that the APOE4-mediated lipid accumulation impairs multiple intracellular
trafficking pathways that converge on the lysosome. Therefore, we hypothesize that intracellular lipid
accumulation in APOE 44 astrocytes jams trafficking to the lysosome (Aim 1), which are controlled by upstream
regulators that can be identified by CRISPRi genetic screening (Aim 2). The APOE4-led endolysosomal defects
in vitro astrocytes can be exacerbated in vivo by excessive lipid challenge induced by neurodegeneration (Aim
3). To test these hypotheses, in Aim 1, we will determine the mechanistic defects of lipid-mediated
endolysosomal trafficking in vitro human APOE 44 astrocytes in transcriptional and functional changes. The
identified phenotypes will be validated in AD post-mortem brain. In Aim 2, using CRISPRi screen on APOE 44
astrocytes, we will identify targets to reverse defected phagocytosis and intracellular lipid accumulation and
determine the mechanisms by CROP-seq. In Aim 3, we will investigate mechanistic endolysosomal defects in
vivo xenotransplanted astrocytes at baseline and during demyelination-associated lipid debris challenge and
further test if CRISPRi-targeted astrocytes exhibit rescued phenotypes in vivo. The goal of this project is to
assess the molecular mechanisms of APOE4-driven endolysosomal and autophagic defects in lipid trafficking
and identify regulatory targets that reverse the phenotype. Further, this proposed research project sets out to
uncover potential therapeutic drug targets to tackle APOE4-driven endolysosomal trafficking endophenotypes
found in APOE4 carrier AD patients."

Maternal smoking is a well-recognized public health concern associated with increased neurodevelopmental
disorders and other health risks in offspring. Substantial evidence indicates various adverse effects of maternal
smoking or prenatal nicotine exposure on neonatal brain development, e.g., hyperactivity, reduced cognitive
performance, increased anxiety and depression, and increased susceptibility to brain injury. Electronic cigarettes
(e-cig) have become popular in pregnant women and young adolescents. Growing evidence suggests that
maternal e-cig use affects brain development, resulting in abnormal cortical neuronal morphology and aberrant
neuro-behaviors in offspring. Using a rat prenatal e-cig exposure model and single-nucleus sequencing, we
recently found that prenatal e-cig exposure disrupted excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance, ratio of excitatory/
inhibitory neurons, in the neonatal brain. E/I balance is crucial for normal brain development and functions, and
its disruption has been postulated to underlie the pathogenesis of many neurodevelopmental disorders, including
autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, and other psychiatric disorders. However, the underlying genomic and
epigenomic mechanisms are still not known. This investigation seeks to fill this knowledge gap. Our hypothesis
is that prenatal e-cig exposure induces epigenomic reprogramming and genomic alterations in the developing
brain, which cause an E/I imbalance and consequently an increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders.
Exploiting the prenatal e-cig exposure model we developed recently, we propose three specific aims. Aim 1 will
determine the spatial-temporal effects of prenatal e-cig exposure on brain development and progression of E/I
imbalance using spatial genomics and single-cell sequencing techniques. Aim 2 will determine the epigenomic
mechanisms regulating the prenatal e-cig induced E/I imbalance. Aim 3 will investigate whether prenatal e-cig
causes genomic alterations (i.e., SNVs and CNVs) that are involved in E/I imbalance. Many cutting-edge
genomic and epigenomic technologies are exploited in our studies, including spatial genomics, single-nucleus
RNA-seq and chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq), and state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools. OUTCOMES: Our
study will: 1) identify the brain regions that show the E/I imbalance caused by prenatal e-cig exposure; 2) identify
the key genes, genomic changes and epigenomic regulations responsible for the prenatal e-cig induced E/I
imbalance; 3) produce a large amount of unprecedented omics data on the rat brain prenatally exposed to e-cig.
IMPACT: Using a well-established intrauterine e-cig exposure model coupled with cutting-edge genomics and
epigenomics approaches, our proposed studies will elucidate the genomic and epigenomic mechanisms
underlying maternal e-cig induced abnormal brain development, providing valuable new insights into the effects
of e-cig on the early central nervous system development, which will help explore promising molecular and
cellular therapeutic targets for treating e-cig vaping-induced brain damage."

Background Microscopic hematuria (blood in urine) may occur in up to 10% of the general population and
results in costly evaluation to ensure it is of no consequence, i.e., no bladder cancer (BCa) is present since
hematuria is typically the initial sign of BCa. Furthermore, 75% of patients with newly diagnosed BCa have non-
muscle-invasive disease (NMIBC), which has a very high recurrence rate (>70%). Because of this, it is
recommended that the patients have adjuvant intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) instillation to reduce
this risk. Despite BCG treatment, up to 50% of patients fail to respond and 20% progress to muscle invasive
bladder cancer (MIBC) mandating more radical treatment (i.e., cystectomy - removal of the urinary bladder).
Moreover, the delay in radical treatment can negatively impact survival rates, hence, a test that could predict
treatment response to intravesical BCG, ensuring the right patient, gets the right treatment at the right time is
urgently required. To date, no such test is available. There exists an unmet clinical need for reliable biomarkers
to a) ‘rule out’ which patients with microscopic hematuria do not require further evaluation and b) predict which
patients will respond to BCG. Hypothesis Our central hypothesis is that a molecular profile exists that is
specifically associated with BCa that a) can be utilized to indicate the presence of BCa in non-invasively
obtained urine samples and b) can be utilized to predict response to BCG. This hypothesis will be tested by
completing the following Specific Aims: 1) To validate the multiplex immunoassay for BCa detection in
subjects presenting with microscopic hematuria, 2) To evaluate the cost benefit, cost utility and cost
effectiveness of the multiplex immunoassay in subjects with hematuria and a history of BCa on tumor
surveillance and 3) To validate prospectively the urine-based multiplex immunoassay to predict BCG response
in subjects with intermediate/high risk NMIBC. Significance This research will open the door for improving on
the non-invasive methods for detecting BCa and predicting treatment response as such it will have a
marked impact on patient care. Methodology Our group has developed and tested a multiplex immunoassay
towards a BCa signature with extremely encouraging results in subjects evaluated for gross hematuria and a
history of BCa on tumor surveillance. In the current proposal, we now seek to test the multiplex assay in two
additional independent cohorts: intermediate/high-risk patients (AUA microscopic hematuria guidelines 2020)
presenting with microscopic hematuria for early BCa detection and patients with intermediate/high risk NMIBC
treated with intravesical BCG to predict treatment response. Furthermore, we will generate Markov models and
using data collected from the parent R01 to assess cost benefit, cost utility and cost effectiveness of the
multiplex immunoassay. Expected Results The validation of the multiplex immunoassay will reduce the need
to subject large numbers of patients who do not have BCa to frequent, uncomfortable and expensive
cystoscopic examinations. Specifically, we would anticipate a reduction in the number of cystoscopies/year by
500,000, which would translate into cost savings of $225 million/year."

10794374,"Frontonasal dysplasia (FND) are congenital craniofacial disorders characterized by ocular hypertelorism,
anterior cranium bifidum, and median facial clefting affecting the nose and upper lip/palate. These birth
defects profoundly disrupt the integrity and function of the skull and orofacial complex, often causing life-long
impairment. The causes and pathogenic mechanisms underlying FND are mostly unknown, which
significantly hinders improvement in FND diagnosis and clinical management. Recently, three independent
studies have identified heterozygous microdeletions at Chromosome 2p21, in which SIX2 is the only protein-
coding gene, in association with an autosomal dominant FND syndrome and suggested SIX2
haploinsufficiency as a cause. However, other patients heterozygous for smaller genomic deletions also
containing all SIX2 coding sequences did not exhibit FND. SIX2 is a member of the sine oculis homeobox
(SIX) family DNA-binding transcription factors. In all vertebrate genomes, Six2 is physically linked to Six3 in
a tail-to-tail configuration, with these two paralogous genes organized into separate topologically associated
domains (TADs) flanking a TAD boundary. Whereas Six2, but not Six3, is abundantly expressed in the cranial
neural crest cell (CNCC) derived frontonasal mesenchyme and in nephrogenic mesenchyme during mouse
embryogenesis, Six2-/- mice exhibited kidney hypoplasia but normal frontonasal structures. Our preliminary
studies found that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of a 99-kb region containing the Six2 gene and the
predicted TAD boundary, but not including the Six3 gene, caused severe FND with median facial cleft in
heterozygous mice, but extending the deletion to 110-kb to include both the Six3 and Six2 genes resulted in
phenotypically distinctive and viable heterozygous mice. Analysis of ENCODE chromatin conformation
capture data from multiple human cell lines suggests that the FND-associated 2p21 deletions likely disrupted
the TAD boundary between SIX2 and SIX3. This R21 project will test a novel hypothesis that the pathogenic
mechanism of SIX2-related FND involves ectopic expression of the neighboring SIX3 gene resulting from
TAD fusion and enhancer-promoter rewiring, not simply SIX2 haploinsufficiency, through generation and
analyses of new genome-edited mouse model as well as isogenic pluripotent stem cell lines carrying distinct
FND or non-FND associated SIX2 genomic deletions. Data from these studies are expected to provide new
insights into pathogenic mechanisms of currently uncharacterized craniofacial and other disorders associated
with structural variations that alter the chromatin landscape, and lead to new improvements in molecular
diagnosis and treatment/care of such patients."
10854953,"ABSTRACT
 E2f (E2f1-8) transcription factors are critical regulators of cell cycle and their activity is physically regulated
by Rb family proteins (Rb, p107 and p130). Disruption of the Rb/E2f interaction is a hallmark of cancer, as
defined by Hanahan&Weinberg. The acquired resistance to antigrowth signals resulting from this disruption is
thought to be necessary for tumor initiation. However, how does unrestricted E2f activity initiates tumorigenesis
in vivo is poorly understood and remains a fundamental gap in our understanding of cancer biology. In
particular, whether the differentiation status affect the capacity of a cell to transform upon disruption of Rb/E2f
interaction is unknown. In addition, whether unrestricted E2f activates other oncogenic features besides
aberrant proliferation is still obscure.
 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second cancer in terms of death worldwide. Limited understanding
of the functional consequences for frequent genetic events hampers the development of efficient therapeutics.
The Rb/E2f interaction is disrupted in the vast majority of HCC, as a consequence of several events that target
upstream components of the Rb/E2f pathway. Therefore, HCC is a relevant model to investigate the
consequences of unrestricted E2f activity for cancer initiation. Accordingly, pan-liver inactivation of Rb family
genes (Triple Knock Out, TKO) is sufficient to initiate HCC (TKO HCC) that recapitulate multiple features of the
human disease.
 Studies of carcinogen-induced models of HCC have led to the conclusion that hepatocytes are the sole
source of HCC. Specific inactivation of Rb family in hepatocytes triggers a short proliferative burst but fails to
initiate HCC. This result challenges the current hepato-centric model in the field and suggests that other
lineages can also serve as a cell of origin for HCC. Accordingly, inactivation of Rb family in multiple liver
lineages reveals that TKO HCC arises from a periductal progenitor. In particular, our preliminary data indicates
that unrestricted E2f activity couples aberrant proliferation with cell fate alteration in this population to initiate
HCC. Based on these data, we propose to:1) determine the molecular mechanisms that alter the cell fate of a
periductal progenitor to serve as a cell of origin for TKO HCC. 2) determine the individual and compound role
of E2f factors in TKO HCC initiation and development. 3) determine therapeutic vulnerabilities in TKO HCC
that could serve as novel treatment for patients.
 We believe that our proposal will address fundamental questions regarding the role of E2f in cancer
initiation, as identified above. In addition, we expect that our results will establish that different cell lineages can
serve as a cell of origin for HCC, which will have important clinical implications, in particular regarding the
classification of patients and the development of therapies tailored for different classes of HCC."

Although many studies have demonstrated correlations between cytoskeletal dynamics, genome organization,
and gene expression, the underlying mechanisms linking them remain unclear. Recently, we discovered
crosstalk between the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin homolog (WAVE) regulatory complex
(WRC), which promotes actin polymerization, and the Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex, a
transcriptional coactivator. Their relationship is established through the sharing of subunits comprising the
SAGA deubiquitinase module, including the deubiquitinase Non-stop. Deubiquitinase module mutations—for
example, polyglutamine expansion in ataxin 7 (ATXN7)—lead to a spectrum of phenotypes not explained by
SAGA’s transcriptional coactivator function, including nervous system degeneration and blindness. In both the
nervous system and the eye, the WRC is an essential promoter of actin polymerization, which is facilitated by
the constitutively active enzymatic subunit WAVE. WAVE activity and localization are regulated by the
remaining WRC subunits, ensuring spatial and temporal control of actin polymerization. Misregulation of actin
polymerizing complexes results in a similar spectrum of phenotypes as seen in SAGA mutants, including
nervous system degeneration and blindness. This suggests that SAGA is important in the nervous system and
eye because it is required to control the WRC in these tissues. We found that the SAGA deubiquitinase module
leaves SAGA to bind the WRC. There, Non-stop deubiquitinates WAVE, increasing its level in both the
cytoplasm and the nucleus. Therefore, we hypothesize that SAGA controls WRC complex composition,
amount, and location; and it is through these activities that SAGA accomplishes functions we had previously
attributed to SAGA alone. This hypotheses will be investigated in three aims. First, we will identify and
characterize nuclear WAVE-containing complexes through affinity purification and column chromatography
coupled to mass spectrometry. Because WAVE activity is regulated in part by its localization, the locations of
these complexes will be determined, and the effects of Atxn7 polyglutamine expansion on complex
composition and localization will be tested. Second, interactions between the SAGA deubiquitinase module
and WRC will be disrupted in cells and flies to determine which SAGA/WRC functions require them. Lastly, the
effects of SAGA deubiquitinase-WRC interactions on blindness and neurodegeneration will be investigated in
flies, by disrupting them and measuring phenotypes characteristic of Atxn7 polyglutamine expansion. These
studies will provide novel insight on the causes of neurodegeneration and blindness, in addition to the links
between transcriptional and cytoskeletal regulatory complexes."
10877933,"Genome segmentation has important implications for viral gene expression control and RNA assembly into nascent virions. It also creates the potential for reassortment: the exchange of intact gene segments between viruses that coinfect the same cell. Reassortment is different from recombination since it allows many distinct genotypes to emerge from a single coinfected cell. Not only does segmentation enhance genetic diversification but it plays a unique role in the evolutionary history of segmented viruses due to the rare occasions when a reassortant is successful at a population scale. A striking example from the Bunyaviridae family of the emergence of a novel virus through reassortment is that of Ngari virus. For influenza A (IAV), the best characterised segmented virus, reassortment has facilitated the formation of pandemic strains in 1957, 1968 and 2009. Out of seven epidemic-prone diseases prioritized by the WHO 2018 R&D Blueprint as public health emergencies with an urgent need for accelerated research, three are Bunyaviruses: Lassa, Rift Valley and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fevers. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this project is that reassortment of segmented viruses plays a major role not only to drive their diversification and evolution, but to dramatically alter their ecology and transmission dynamics. Specifically, we aim to 1) develop mathematical models of the intracellular life cycle for a family of segmented viruses to quantify for the first time their viral replication dynamics and reassortment frequencies, and 2) develop standardised sequencing protocols and novel phylogenetic methods to quantify the evolutionary and epidemiological implications of reassortment for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). A biobank with clinical and field samples from CCHFV endemic regions in Turkey and Tajikistan will be set up in this project. Clinical and field data will be leveraged to ensure our methods and results have the potential to inform public health strategies, predict outbreak risk and contribute to the One Health approach for the prevention and control of CCHF disease."

This R01 application is in response to PAS-18-915 entitled “HIV/AIDS High Priority Drug Abuse Research”.
Our project will investigate the molecular and functional interactions between HIV and morphine in regulation of
alternative pre-mRNA splicing of the opioid receptor M1 (OPRM1) with implications for enhanced opioid
dependence observed in the people with HIV (PWH). Clinically used opioids, such as morphine, as well as
illicit drugs, such as heroin, activate OPRM1 that is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)
family. OPRM1 pre-mRNA undergoes extensive alternative splicing events. To date, 21 isoforms of the human
OPRM1 with alternative C-terminal and/or N-terminal regions and 17 isoforms of the rat OPRM1, have been
identified. Given the importance of these regions in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, differential
regulation of OPRM1 isoforms would have functional consequences. However, characterization of OPRM1
signaling is generalized, and only one isoform (MOR1) has been extensively studied. Our preliminary data
suggest that expression of splicing regulatory protein SRSF1 and alternative splicing of MOR-1X is
preferentially induced in neuronal cells exposed to morphine. Interestingly, our results also revealed that
alternative splicing and expression of MOR-1X isoform is induced in postmortem brain tissues obtained from
the PWH. These results suggested that HIV and morphine may impact OPRM1 alternative splicing and
synergistically induce MOR-1X isoform expression. The mutually exclusive exon X of OPRM1 pre-mRNA is
incorporated into the mature mRNA transcript following exon 3 in the MOR-1X mRNA transcript. This insertion
results in substantially longer C-terminal tail having new motifs potentially binding with several cellular kinases
that is unique to the MOR-1X isoform. We recently reported that glial cells infected with HIV-1 release Nef
protein captured within the extracellular vesicles (Nef-EVs) which are readily taken up by neurons. We further
assessed possible role of Nef-EVs and two other HIV secretory proteins, Tat and gp120, in alternative splicing
of MOR-1X. Interestingly, while recombinant Tat and gp120 had no visible effects, treatment of neurons with
Nef-EVs caused a comparable induction in MOR-1X alternative splicing as did treatment with morphine. Our
preliminary results also revealed that co-treatment of neurons with Nef-EVs and morphine synergistically
induced MOR-1X alternative splicing. Additionally, alternative splicing of MOR-1X was induced in brain regions
involved in the reward pathways of the F344 rat that is the control strain of HIV-1Tg rat that has an additive
induction with the exposure to morphine. Taken all together, we hypothesize that HIV-1 contributes to the
increased rate of opioid dependence in the PWH by amplifying the rate of MOR-1X alternative splicing induced
by morphine. Our proposed studies will reveal a novel synergistic interaction between morphine and HIV on
alternative splicing of OPRM1 pre-mRNA leading to preferential expression of MOR-1X isoform with
implications in physical dependence of morphine."

 Epigenetic modifications are essential chemical modifications that play critical roles in gene regulation,
development, and diseases. Therefore, understanding how epigenetic changes between species occur and
how they affect gene regulation has potential to advance our knowledge of regulatory evolution. However, the
details of epigenetic evolution are sparse, and how epigenetic evolution correlates with phenotype evolution is
even less understood. The proposed research will address this gap of knowledge by integrating novel data on
DNA methylation with primate brain evolution. Studies of human brains have demonstrated that distinctive
brain cell types have substantially different DNA methylation and gene expression, and analyses without
separating these cell types can yield misleading results. Additionally, comparative studies of primates and
other mammals have shown that the anatomical and cellular structure of brain regions evolve at varying rates
as a result of differences in neurodevelopmental events linked to overall brain size. DNA methylation is a key
molecular mechanism to record and affect development, and shows difference between brain regions.
Therefore, the proposed research will test a novel hypothesis that DNA methylation of distinctive cell types in
human and non-human primate brains shows variation consistent with brain size evolution. Moreover,
validation studies will be performed for specific candidate genes and genomic regions that show DNA
methylation and gene expression difference related to brain region differences and species differences.
Specifically, evolutionary histories will be constructed for DNA methylation (Specific Aim 1) and gene
expression (Specific Aim 2) from two major subclasses of neurons (excitatory and inhibitory neurons) as well
as oligodendrocytes (a major non-neuronal cell) of brains from diverse anthropoid primates, including humans,
apes, and monkeys. Highly divergent brain regions in terms of function and anatomy (e.g., prefrontal cortex
and the pons) will be compared to connect changes at the phenotypic level to molecular changes. Some of
these candidate genes will be further investigated in deeper histological resolution (Specific Aim 3). This study
will generate novel data to expand our understanding of epigenetic evolution of brains, and to infer functionally
important positions of noncoding genomic regions. Furthermore, it will also provide knowledge on how
epigenome changes during evolution and how epigenome evolution correlates with phenotype, which is a
fundamental yet currently little understood topic."
10850828,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and is associated with a
dismal prognosis. Immunotherapy has demonstrated potential to generate durable antitumor activity in other
types of cancer. In particular, agents that selectively target checkpoint molecules, such as anti-CTLA-4 and
anti-PD-1 antibodies, have accelerated the field of cancer immunotherapy by directly combating the tumor's
mechanisms of immune evasion. Notable results with these agents have already been reported in advanced
melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and lung cancer and trials are underway in GBM. Chemotherapy, which is
part of the standard of care for patients with GBM, has been associated with immunosuppressive effects and
with myeloablative results. Recent data from our laboratory shows that local chemotherapy may be a better
alternative to systemic chemotherapy given that it avoids these untoward effects. The main goal of this
proposal is to understand the main mechanisms by which GBM evades the immune system and how to thwart
these mechanisms with local chemotherapy and checkpoint blockade to enhance an effective immune
response against GBM. Our data demonstrates that local chemotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1
increases survival and provides an increase in memory T cells in an orthotopic glioma model and protects
against tumor re-challenge. We propose to study: 1. Potential biomarkers of response in patients with GBM
treated with LC and anti-PD-1 therapy as part of an ongoing clinical trial at our institution. 2. The neoantigen
profile generated by LC in intracranial chemosensitive and chemoresistant murine gliomas, to determine the
impact on TCR diversity and anti-tumor immune response. 3. The location and identity of APCs responsible for
antigen presentation induced by LC. These data will have direct clinical relevance for the findings and can be
translational into clinical trials and patient care. We expect that the data generated from these studies will
provide novel insights into a previously unexplored aspect of chemotherapy and serve as a foundation for
optimizing the efficacy of therapy and host immune function against GBM. The knowledge obtained from this
study will undoubtedly result in better therapeutic alternatives for current unsuccessful treatment for patients
with GBM."
10747985,"Enhanced sensitivity of blood pressure to salt intake is present in nearly half of Americans affected by
hypertension, including approximately 75% of African American hypertensive patients. Basolateral inwardly
rectifying K+ (Kir) channels, specifically Kir4.1 and Kir4.1/Kir5.1 (encoded by Kcnj10 and Kcnj16 genes), play a
dominant role in modulating water and electrolyte transport in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron. Renal
Kir4.1/Kir5.1 heterotetramer is a primary basolateral channel at the distal and collecting ducts principal cells and
plays an essential role in the regulation of plasma K+ level and Na+ reabsorption. The malfunction of this channel
caused by genetic or medication-related factors can be directly involved in hypokalemic, hyperkalemic and
hypertensive pathologies in humans. From the other side, precise pharmacological or genetic modulation of
Kir4.1or Kir5.1 subunits may provide a new useful tool to the control of electrolyte balance in the body and will
open new ways to treat and prevent the development of salt-sensitive hypertension and kidney damage. The
Dahl Salt-Sensitive (SS) rat, a naturally occurring model of salt-sensitive hypertension, recapitulates many
aspects of progressive human disease providing key insights into mechanisms underlying salt-sensitivity. We
have created two rat models in which Kir4.1or Kir5.1 have been knocked out in the SS rat (SSKcnj10-/- and SSKcnj16-
/- rats, respectively), enabling us to assess the role of both Kir4.1and Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels in the control of K+
homeostasis and the development of salt-sensitive hypertension. Given the reported associations of Kir4.1/Kir5.1
with a variety of cardiorenal diseases, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which Kir4.1/Kir5.1 can
influence electrolyte homeostasis, the activity of other channels and transporters, and blood pressure control in
the setting of salt-induced hypertension. The Specific Aims of this proposal are 1) To define the dynamic interplay
between Kir4.1/Kir5.1, NCC, ENaC channels/transporters and RAAS in the kidney and the role of these
mechanisms in the control of electrolyte balance in the body. Changes in RAAS hormones under high salt and
dietary potassium supplements, basolateral membrane potential in individual cells of DCT and CCD tubules,
NCC and ENaC activity, sodium/potassium homeostasis, and the effect of a mineralocorticoid receptor inhibitors
will be tested in SSKcnj10-/- and SSKcnj16-/- rats. 2) To determine if pharmacological inhibition of Kir4.1/Kir5.1
attenuates salt-induced hypertension. Our preliminary and published experiments revealed that nortriptyline, an
FDA-approved second-generation tricyclic antidepressant, significantly decreases Kir4.1/Kir5.1-mediated K+-
selective conductance and modulates ENaC activity in CCD cells. Using novel specific compounds, such as
VU992, VU690, and VU726 in WT and SSKcnj16-/- rats, we will determine the viability of Kir4.1/Kir5.1 as a
pharmacological target to regulate sodium-potassium homeostasis in the body. We hypothesize that direct
modulation of basolateral Kir channel activity will play a protective role in the development of salt-induced
hypertension and will lead to the discovery of more effective treatments for high blood pressure."

Metastasis is the major cause of BrCa death. Most women with metastatic BrCa (stage IV) are treated mainly
with systemic therapy such as hormone therapy (for estrogen receptor-positive BrCa), chemotherapy, targeted
therapy, and some combinations. Current treatments are very unlikely to cure metastatic BrCa, with more than
70% death rate within 5 years of diagnosis. Therapeutic targeting BrCa metastasis is largely lacking. Here we
are aiming to develop a single agent with dual targeting capability: 1) to kill metastatic cancer cells directly; 2) to
kill cancer specific regulatory T cells (Tregs) hence inducing anti-cancer immunity. With an effort to search the
potential molecular target, we decided to inhibit BCL-XL using an emerging novel PROTAC technology. With two
lead PROTAC compounds (BCL-XL-Ps) we have recently developed, we found that both compounds can
efficiently lead to the degradation of BCL-XL in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, it appears that the BCL-XL-Ps work
in all syngeneic cancer models we have tested with the strongest suppressive efficacy in breast cancer
metastasis. Using multidisciplinary techniques, we believe BCL-XL-Ps kill metastatic cancer cells and Tregs
simultaneously as we initially expected. The current project will define the lineage-specific role of BCL-XL in
cancer cells and in Tregs. Even though the direct cancer cell killing may not be sufficient to eradicate metastatic
tumor growth as shown in the preliminary data, a portion of dead cancer cells may provide sufficient auto- or
neo-antigens for T cell activation. In addition, BCL-XL depletion in cancer cells sensitizes them to CD8-T cell
mediated killing. The BCL-XL-Ps-mediated Treg depletion and direct activation of T cells elicits a strong anti-
cancer immunity that can be harvested for cancer therapy. Simultaneous depletion of BCL-XL by BCL-XL-Ps in
cancer cells further sensitize them to CD8-T cell mediated killing. Here we will study the lineage-specific roles of
BCL-XL in cancer. The translational research is also strongly supported by clinical observations that BCL-XL
protein expression predicts shorter patient survival in breast cancer patients. Our long-term goal is to develop
the lead compound into clinic for dual targeting of cancer cells and Tregs in treating metastatic breast cancers."
10845309,"PROJECT SUMMARY :
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has a major negative impact in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTxR) due to
limitations in current preventive and therapeutic strategies, especially in CMV seronegative recipients (R-) of
organs from seropositive donors (D+) [D+R-]. The D+R- subset comprises ~25% of all SOTxR but >80% of CMV
disease and is independently associated with worse long-term survival after SOTx. The disproportionate impact
in D+R- SOTxR results from an impaired ability to develop a primary immune response to donor-transmitted
CMV infection in the context of immunosuppression. Strategies that elicit or enhance CMV-specific immunity
prior to SOTx could lead to more effective prevention/control of CMV after SOTx, minimizing the need for toxic
CMV antiviral therapy (AVT). We have developed a modified vaccinia Ankara virus vaccine, Triplex, that
expresses immunodominant CMV antigens pp65, IE-1, and IE-2 that are targets of protective T cell immunity.
Triplex elicits robust, long-lasting, and functional CMV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells. Triplex was safe,
accelerated reconstitution of CMV protective immunity, and reduced significant CMV infection by ~50% in a
phase 2 study of allogeneic hematopoietic cell TxR. Our long-term goals are to harness vaccine-induced CMV-
specific cellular immunity to reduce the impact of CMV in D+R- SOTxR and to define immune correlates of risk
(CoR) and for protection (CoP) (i.e. immune correlates of Triplex vaccine efficacy [VE]). The central hypothesis
is that pre-Tx Triplex vaccination of CMV seronegative LTx candidates elicits functional CMV-specific CD4 and
CD8 T cells, leading to improved immune control of CMV and significantly decreases the need for CMV AVT post-
Tx in D+R- LTxR who receive preemptive therapy (PET) for CMV prevention. We further hypothesize that there
are specific immune CoR for CMV outcomes and CoP of Triplex vaccine. We will leverage our established
consortium and preliminary studies in a target population of D+R- LTxR with high unmet need (no FDA-approved
available antiviral prophylaxis options, highly susceptible to valganciclovir toxicity, and significant CMV-
associated morbidity, mortality, and cost). The objectives of this proposal are to assess the efficacy, safety and
immunogenicity of Triplex in D+R- LTxR in a phase 2 study and to define the immune CoR and CoP using state-
of-the-art polyfunctional T cell assays and novel analytic approaches (COMbinatorial Polyfunctionality analysis
of Antigen-Specific T cell Subsets [COMPASS]). An effective pre-Tx CMV vaccination approach would transform
CMV prevention strategies in SOTx. The proposed studies will define immune CoR for clinical outcomes, which
will facilitate efficient evaluation of future immune-based strategies, and lead to broader implementation of the
more effective PET CMV prevention strategy in D+R- LTxR."
10876913,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Elevated body mass index (BMI) at pregnancy onset and excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) are
consistently associated with adverse pregnancy and child outcomes. Diet and lifestyle interventions during
pregnancy have had limited success in reducing GWG or postpartum weight retention (PPWR), with no
improvement in perinatal or childhood outcomes. Therefore, multiple organizations recommend that women
attain a healthy weight before pregnancy. However, the benefit and risks for mother and child extending
beyond delivery, optimal timing of preconception weight change, and how risks and benefits of
preconception weight loss differ across clinical subgroups are currently unknown. Our preliminary data
suggest that the weight trajectories upon which women enter pregnancy (loss, maintenance, or gain) may
impact the hormonal milieu of early pregnancy as well as the amount of GWG and PPWR. The objective of
this study is to examine the impact of weight trajectories in the immediate preconception period (within 2
years before pregnancy) on GWG, PPWR, pregnancy outcomes, and child growth. Our central hypothesis is
that preconception weight change toward a normal BMI reduces risk of adverse pregnancy and birth
outcomes by improving pre-pregnancy weight status, but may increase GWG, which then increases risks of
outcomes sensitive to GWG (PPWR, large for gestational age, infant weight gain, child BMI). We further
hypothesize that these associations are strongest among women with more extreme BMI and for more rapid
weight change occurring closer to pregnancy. To test this hypothesis, we will leverage a transcontinental
clinical data warehouse spanning almost 20 years with the weight and pregnancy data of more than 130,000
racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse women, and weight and length/height data of their children
through age 3 years. We will determine the relationship between maternal preconception weight trajectories
and GWG (total and trimester-specific) and PPWR at 6 weeks and 12 months postpartum, risk of adverse
pregnancy outcomes (gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension/preeclampsia, and cesarean section)
and child outcomes (preterm birth, size for gestational age at birth, infant growth trajectory, and BMI at 3
years of age); and the degree to which these associations are mediated by GWG. For each aim, we will test
the hypotheses within pre-pregnancy BMI classifications, high risk clinical subgroups (e.g., pre-existing
diabetes, hypertension) and racial/ethnic subgroups. Our findings will inform preconception weight
management recommendations and shape the future of preconception and antenatal weight management
research."
10830436,"Increased media attention regarding COVID-related health disparities combined with horrific
institutionalized violence against Black Americans have revitalized the call to action to address systemic racism
in health care. Among the consequences of systemic racism in health care are significant health disparities in
prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of comorbid physical and mental health conditions. Despite decades of
studies acknowledging health disparities based on race and an increased awareness of the social
determinants of health, we seem to be lightyears away from significant change. There are shockingly few
evidence-based interventions to change racism attitudes, behaviors, and practices at the provider and
organizational-systems level. New paradigms are needed to intervene on, and not just document, racism in
health care systems. We propose to develop and test a transformative paradigm for translating basic
behavioral and social science into new anti-racism interventions for primary care settings. The paradigm is the
first of its kind to integrate community-based participatory research, systems science, diffusion of innovation
theory, and item response theory, leveraging an established framework of early phase translational behavioral
and social science to rigorously define new anti-racism interventions within complex health systems and
rigorously develop measures to assess impact. Anti-racism is a disruptive innovation in integrated primary
care systems in the United States, one that can be rigorously mapped using community-engaged systems
science methods. This map identifies “inflection points” likely to result in the most impactful intervention targets,
and then established pathways can be used to translate fundamental behavioral and social science discoveries
into new interventions at these points. Systems science modeling can then simulate potential interventions and
produce mathematical standards for intervention efficacy in future trials. This transformative paradigm will also
detail innovative methods to develop efficient and effective measurement tools to rigorously monitor outcomes.
This transformative paradigm of antiracism as a disruptive innovation will not only revolutionize health equity
interventions in integrated primary care systems but will provide a foundation for improving health care racism
in other systems."
10892663,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Sepsis is a deadly infection characterized by a dysregulated host immune response. Outcomes have failed to
improve despite decades of research. The immune response in sepsis is varied. Immunologic therapy has failed
in part due to the heterogeneity of the syndrome. Beyond the immunologically silent apoptosis,
necroinflammatory cell death, commonly necroptosis, is immunologically stimulating and can perpetuate
inflammation in sepsis. The initiation and coordination of necroinflammatory cell death is complex. TNF related
apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) coordinates cellular processes associated with increased apoptosis and
necroinflammatory cell death. Receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 3 (RIPK3) is essential to necroptotic
cell death. Our work has shown that RIPK3 is increased in septic patients in the intensive care unit in parallel
with increased organ dysfunction and is associated with poor outcomes. In the ICU, we have demonstrated that
lower TRAIL is associated with higher RIPK3 and increased organ dysfunction. In this project, we will examine
TRAIL and RIPK3 at three time points, in the emergency department and ICU. We hypothesize that
necroinflammatory cell death, characterized by high RIPK3 and low TRAIL will identify those who progress to
sepsis and septic shock and that there will be novel patterns of necroinflammatory cell death in patients at
increased risk of death with sepsis. AIM 1 will create a human cohort of patients at three critical time points
during an acute admission to the hospital. The first is soon after admission to the emergency department prior
to resuscitation and the administration of antimicrobial therapy. The follow up blood draws are obtained following
admission to the ward or ICU when organ dysfunction is established and therapy has been initiated. AIM 2 will
examine the relationship between TRAIL and RIPK3 and sepsis, septic shock and mortality through two
methodologies. The first will examine whether TRAIL and RIPK3 will increase our ability to diagnose sepsis when
combined with physiologic sepsis prediction tools in the emergency department. The second will evaluate the
effect of the follow up TRAIL and RIPK3 on outcomes, after modeling the effect of time dependent patient,
pathogen and treatment factors. For AIM 3, we will measure levels of a targeted mechanistic cell death panel
including, RIPK1, RIPK3, MLKL, along with key damage associated molecular patterns, mtDNA and HMGB1.
We will also evaluate a broader necroinflammatory biomarker panel in a proteomics platform. We will then
evaluate whether there are clusters of patients defined by relative biomarker levels together with physiologic
variables. We will examine if these patient clusters have differential outcomes. If the aims of this proposal are
achieved, we will have useful information concerning the role of necroinflammatory cell death in human sepsis
from multiple time points. Results from this study may offer insight into the development of biomarkers for
predictive enrichment of clinical trials targeting necroinflammatory cell death."

The larger goal of this study is to gain foundational knowledge and demonstrate the feasibility of
restoring percepts of arm muscle force using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in cortical
area 3a. Restoring this specific sensory percept is particularly important to paralyzed individuals
that use brain-controlled functional electrical stimulation (FES) of their peripheral nerves to
restore arm movements by thought after spinal cord injury. Appropriate balancing of antagonist
muscle forces in this population is critical for maintaining limb stability and minimizing muscle
fatigue and battery drain. In Aim 1, we will use primate imaging and surgical planning software
to implant custom chronic microwire electrode arrays deep into the elbow region of the central
sulcus of two Rhesus macaques (four hemispheres total) to target the difficult-to-reach
somatosensory area 3a. Area 3a receives a range of proprioceptive signals from Golgi tendon
organs (conveys muscle force) and muscle spindle fibers (conveys muscle length and change in
length) and should provide muscle-specific percepts most directly relevant to optimizing FES
arm movement restoration. However, most of what is known about 3a proprioceptive encoding
has been collected from acute recordings. In this study, we will use chronic microelectrode
recordings and a range of active and passive sensorimotor tasks across days to more fully
characterize 3a encoding. These data will then be used to quantify the relative function and
spatial distribution of these different sensory encoding characteristics on the spatial scale
relevant to restoring these sensations via ICMS. In the second aim, we will use a novel force
tracking game to test the animals' ability to perceive ICMS of force-dominant electrode locations
as an increase in muscle force. This game is designed to prevent the animals from just learning
to respond to some unnatural `sensation' for a reward and will verify that the subjects are
actually utilizing the force percepts in their motor planning. Finally, we will conduct these tests
using a range of stimulus parameters to quantify the magnitude of the force percepts as a
function of stimulation parameters."
10891499,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Proposed are complementary studies on the mechanisms and regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis
(CME) and actin force generation during CME in budding yeast and human stem cells. CME is responsible for
uptake of molecules from a cell's environment through the permeability barrier of the plasma membrane and
for selective removal of plasma membrane proteins. It is also one of the main routes for COVID-19 to enter
cells. Therefore, this process is crucial for determining how cells respond to their surroundings and has
heightened translational significance. Many proteins and lipids that mediate CME have been identified and
their functions determined biochemically and in living cells. Imaging of fluorescently labeled CME proteins in
live cells has revealed the intricate recruitment timing and order for some 60 CME proteins. However, how
cargo capture is coordinated with vesicle formation, how correct protein recruitment order and timing are
achieved, which events and molecules play critical roles in the pathway, and how forces curve the membrane
and drive vesicle scission, are not fully understood. The following key questions will be addressed in budding
yeast and human stem cells: 1) How does membrane curvature affect biochemical reaction rates? 2) How
does CME become specialized for different cell types during differentiation? 3) How does a checkpoint sense
cargo and regulate CME progress? and, 4) How does actin assemble at CME sites and how does its
ultrastructure contribute to CME force production and adapt to increased membrane tension? Yeast studies will
be empowered by a rich legacy in the lab of elucidating actin assembly and force production mechanisms.
Human cell studies will be empowered by over 120 stable human tissue culture and stem cell lines generated
using genome editing to express CME and actin cytoskeleton proteins as fluorescent protein fusions at native,
endogenous levels. Because CME proteins are highly conserved in structure and function, principles learned
from studies of yeast and humans will complement and inform each other. Together, these studies will provide
a comprehensive mechanistic understanding that could not be achieved by studies in only one cell type.
Because the actin cytoskeleton has been adapted by evolution for diverse, essential activities including cell
motility, organelle transport, adhesion, and cell polarity development, what is learned will apply broadly for
many cellular processes and will join the growing armamentarium of possible defensive measures against the
pandemic."
10675568,"ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecological malignancy. Nearly 75% of patients present with metastatic intra-
peritoneal (i.p.) disease. Radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy are not very effective. In comparison,
the degree of cytoreduction at surgery is one of the most important factors for prognosis and methods to improve
its efficacy are sorely needed. Detection pre-surgically and at surgery are major constraints. Presently, pre-
surgical imaging is limited in detecting i.p. disease, and, surgery is limited because it relies on the naked eye to
identify nodules for resection. Moreover, some nodules are in eloquent locations that preclude surgery. A
theranostic agent that upon a single injection enables in vivo imaging of i.p. disease for pre-surgical planning,
near-infrared (NIR) imaging to visualize tumors at surgery for resection, and photodestruction of tumors in
eloquent locations is a key clinical need in ovarian cancer. For MR imaging, we created dual-Gd liposomal
nanoparticles, with two gadolinium (Gd) presentations upon the liposome to increase relaxivity, and
demonstrated that they have ~10,000 times greater relaxivity/nanoparticle than current commercially available
MR contrast agents. Dual-Gd is based on FDA approved building blocks. For NIR imaging, we incorporated
indocyanine green (ICG), the only FDA approved NIR fluorophore. We found that unlike similarly dosed ICG or
clinically available Gd-chelates, our new dual-mode dual-Gd (DM-Dual-Gd) nanoparticle detects i.p. tumors by
both MR and NIR in two different human ovarian cancer models two days after a single systemic injection. The
long tumor residence time should enable non-invasive imaging, presurgical planning, and surgery. Moreover,
ICG can enable photodestruction. To enhance, tumor localization for imaging and treatment, we propose to
decorate the particles for proven/novel targets for ovarian cancer. To improve visualization at surgery, we will
capitalize on the second NIR window that is less prone to photon absorption and scattering by tissues. In the
appropriate context, ICG can fluoresce in this window and can be excited with appropriate light wavelengths to
produce heat and oxygen radicals. We plan to exploit the latter for photodestruction of ovarian tumors. For
practical needs of clinical translation, we propose to test the accuracy of these methods for detecting ovarian
tumor implants and hypothesize that pre-surgical MR imaging and surgical optical imaging/photodestruction
employing DM-Dual-Gd-based nanoparticles can improve overall survival. Thus, this proposal seeks to create a
new paradigm for approaching ovarian cancer that enables presurgical planning, surgical resection, and tumor
photodestruction after a single nanoparticle injection. We will test the hypotheses that SA1: ovarian tumor
delivery can be augmented by targeting DM-Dual-Gd to proven or novel imaging targets; SA2: ovarian tumor
detection can be improved using the NIR II window compared to the NIR I window; SA3: DM-Dual-Gd-based
nanoparticles enable photodestruction of ovarian tumors; SA4: pre-surgical MR imaging and surgical NIR
imaging employing DM-Dual-Gd can improve survival of models of i.p. ovarian cancer."

 Our long-term goal is to establish non-invasive approaches to predict drug disposition in children, which
includes developing phenotypic biomarkers of drug transporters and drug metabolizing enzymes and pediatric
physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. During the previous funding period, we gained a
considerable understanding of age-dependent hepatic metabolism and transport from neonates to adults, which
was used to develop PBPK models to predict the disposition of hepatically cleared pediatric drugs. However,
ontogeny data remain limited for another key drug elimination organ: the kidney. The main objective of this
proposal is to define the ontogeny of drug transport in the kidney. Filling this knowledge gap is critical, as
approximately 30% of prescription drugs are cleared predominantly by the kidneys, including several drugs
prescribed to children. Further, tubular secretion plays a crucial role in drug detoxification in children, which is
often regulated by the rate-limiting organic anion or cation transporters (OATs and OCTs, respectively). Although
we and others recently quantified clinically relevant drug transporters in archived kidney tissue samples, these
data are highly variable and are from a limited number of subjects, precluding a meaningful interpretation of
transporter ontogeny. To address these knowledge gaps, we hypothesize that endogenous substrates of
OATs and OCTs in blood and urine can be used as surrogate, non-invasive markers of kidney transporter
function in children and adults. We will test this hypothesis via three Specific Aims. Aim 1: Establish robust
biomarkers of renal OAT and OCT transport activity in adult humans in a controlled clinical drug-drug interaction
study using furosemide and metformin as probe drugs, respectively. The effects of OAT and OCT inhibition by
probenecid and cimetidine, respectively, on both exogenous and endogenous probes will be determined. Aim
2a: Confirm the utility of Oat and Oct transporter biomarkers in predicting ontogeny of renal transporter
abundance and activity in Sprague-Dawley rats. Aim 2b: Characterize the ontogeny of renal transporters in
humans using exogenous (furosemide and metformin) and endogenous (biomarkers) probes of renal
transporters. Aim 3a: Characterize the selectivity of renal uptake of the biomarkers in vitro. Aim 3b: Develop and
validate biomarker-informed PBPK models for renally secreted anionic and cationic drugs in children and adults.
Collectively, this innovative project will establish non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to predict transporter-
mediated renal secretion and drug-drug interaction potential in children and adults. Specifically, the effect of
inhibition of renal transporters by an investigational drug on xenobiotic or endobiotic toxins (e.g., drugs or uremic
toxins) can be predicted in children and adults using these biomarkers. The validated transporter activity
biomarkers garnered from this translational project will inform precision dosing of pediatric drugs secreted by
kidneys during clinical trials and clinical use."

The unavailability of culturally competent mental health care for Chinese immigrant breast cancer survivors
and their unmet psychological needs characterize the health disparity experienced by Chinese immigrant
breast cancer survivors. Breast cancer is the cancer with the highest incidence rate among the Chinese
population and Chinese immigrant breast cancer survivors have lower quality of life compared to their non-
Hispanic white counterpart. However, interventions to improve quality of life are lacking among this
immigrant population. Expressive writing intervention uses writing prompts to promote health by facilitating
emotional and cognitive processes. Guided by Western and Eastern theories and preliminary studies
showing the benefits of expressive writing among Chinese immigrants, this study proposes to test the health
effects of an innovative and brief writing intervention among Chinese immigrant breast cancer survivors
using a randomized controlled trial and mixed methods design. Chinese immigrant breast cancer survivors
(N=240) will be randomly assigned either to a control condition to write about neutral topics or to one of two
intervention conditions, self-regulation and self-cultivation, which both aim to promote adaptive cognitive
processes but differ in how they achieve this goal. The self-regulation intervention incorporates a traditional
Western expressive writing paradigm, whereas the self-cultivation intervention incorporates Asian cultural
values. Participants in all three conditions will be asked to write in Chinese during three weekly 30-minute
sessions. The primary outcome will be QOL, and the secondary outcomes will be perceived stress, stress
biomarkers, and medical appointments for cancer-related morbidities. Self-reported health outcomes (QOL
and perceived stress) will be assessed at baseline and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Stress biomarkers
(salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase) will be assessed at baseline and 6-week follow-up, and perceived
stress will also be self-reported at the 6-week follow-up. Medical appointments up to the 12-month follow-up
will be self-recorded and verified by medical record. We hypothesize that the two intervention conditions will
improve quality of life, reduce perceived stress and medical appointments for cancer-related morbidities, and
normalize stress biomarkers. Few studies have tested evidence-based programs in communities of color,
and even fewer have tested culturally based interventions that adopted the cultural values of the
underserved communities. We expect that the proposed study, guided by theory, practices, and methods
and tailored for an underserved population, will inspire new directions in research to address these
scientific and practical needs in health disparities research."

Project Summary
Each year in the US, over 195,000 active dental practitioners provide care to more than 127 million patients,
costing more than $117 billion annually. Despite this national investment in oral health, there is little
understanding of the return in terms of quality. Although there is strong evidence for effective strategies for
treating and preventing caries, oral health remains a significant burden for both children and adults. We are
currently faced with an uneven oral healthcare delivery system where a few lucky patients receive evidence-
based and person-centered care. Our current quality measurement work has shown that we can use data
captured in electronic health records to accurately measure the quality of dental care. We have also
demonstrated that there is a large gap between the current state of how dental clinics perform and the desired
performance, especially for dental caries. In our current award (R01DE024166), we discovered that a large
proportion of patients (44%-77%) were not being treated for their existing dental caries. Even when treated,
13% to 24% of existing patients were being diagnosed again with new decay within 6 months of their last
treatment.
 Our overarching goal is to provide the right care to the right patient at the right time. In order to do this,
we first need to setup a practice-level learning health system (LHS) supported by an effective informatics
infrastructure, relevant data governance and a culture of learning that drives evidence-based dental practice.
Hence as the next step in our research agenda, the objective of this application is to improve dental care
quality relating to caries management strategies, the oral health condition with the highest impact, by
developing a multi-component intervention, that includes key components of an LHS.
 We will conduct the study at four large and diverse dental institutions: UT Houston, the University of
California San Francisco, HealthPartners and Willamette Dental Group/Skourtes Institute. In Aim 1, we identify
and understand the contributing factors (conduct problem analysis) leading to the current level of performance
through chart reviews, patient and provider interviews, and targeted clinic observations. In Aim 2, we design
and develop strategies to improve the quality of dental caries management at the institutions, using a human-
centered design approach for developing effective and actionable Audit and Feedback and EHR-based Clinical
Decision Support. In Aim 3, we implement and evaluate the improvement strategies and determine their impact
on quality measure performance, acceptability, fidelity and identify the barriers and facilitators for its use. Early
and continuous engagement of key stakeholders in all phases of the project will increase the likelihood of
developing, implementing and adopting sustainable solutions.
 The outcomes of our research will arm dental providers with both the knowledge and know-how to
measure and improve the quality of dental caries management resulting in better oral health, and subsequently
better general health, for our patients."

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) makes up to 15-20% of breast cancer diagnoses. While surgery and
adjuvant chemotherapy are effective treatment options for early-stage disease, there are very few therapeutic
options for advanced metastatic TNBC, and the 11% relative five-year survival rate highlights an urgent need to
discover actionable targets. In the hematogenous metastatic cascade, a few aggressive tumor cells are capable
of crossing the endothelial barrier at least twice: when entering systemic circulation (intravasation) and then
again when exiting circulation to colonize distant organs (extravasation). High expression of JAGGED-1 (JAG1),
a Notch ligand, is strongly associated with TNBC metastasis and consequent mortality. Our preliminary work in
static culture suggests that JAG1 enhances TNBC binding to the endothelium and transendothelial migration
(TEM), thereby promoting dissemination of tumor cells through vascular beds. We propose to study two distinct
mechanisms for JAG1 in the metastatic cascade. In Aim 1, we will investigate how tumor JAG1 signals in trans
to the endothelium to prime the vascular barrier for invasion. We will examine extravasation of our recently
generated TNBC CRISPR JAG1 knockout clones and control cells using a microfluidics system that faithfully
models capillary fluid shear forces and permits visualization of multiple critical steps of extravasation in vitro. We
will also test the role of JAG1 in vivo by examining the rate of lung capillary extravasation and pulmonary seeding
following tail vein injection of JAG1 knockout and control TNBC cells. In Aim 2, we will define the tumor cell-
intrinsic transcriptional program regulated by JAG1. Our preliminary RNA sequencing data suggest that novel
JAG1 targets promote cell surface interactions distinct from Notch targets. We will determine the metastatic
importance of key JAG1 targets by restoring expression and testing for TEM phenotypes. In the training plan of
the fellowship, I highlight an integrated scientific, clinical, and educational blueprint to enhance my personal
research and doctoring skills as an aspiring physician-scientist in oncology."

Breast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and cause of cancer mortality in Asian/Pacific
Islander (API) and Hispanic women, the two most rapidly growing minority ethnic groups in the US due to
immigration. Once diagnosed, immigrant API women have similar or worse, and immigrant Hispanic women
have better, BC survival than ethnically similar, US-born women, the latter despite later stage at diagnosis.
Investigators have frequently speculated that social networks play an important role in BC outcomes among
immigrant populations, through beneficial health behaviors that are maintained due to living in neighborhoods
characterized as “ethnic or immigrant enclaves” or through adverse behaviors related to reduced availability of
resources. At the individual level, in largely non-Hispanic white populations, women with large supportive social
networks have been shown to have better health behaviors and BC survival. However, no research has
explored the multilevel (neighborhood and individual) influence of social networks on health behaviors and BC
outcomes in diverse API and Hispanic immigrant women. Therefore, in a large (N=6,184), pooled northern
California cohort of 683 Hispanic (41% immigrant), 851 API (59% immigrant), and 4,650 (8% immigrant) NHW
women from the Pathways, the Life After Cancer Epidemiology, and the Asian CHI studies, diagnosed with
stage I-IV BC, we propose to: 1) Evaluate associations between immigrant status and social networks at the
neighborhood level (i.e., immigrant and ethnic enclaves and sociocultural institutions) and at the individual level
(i.e., self-reported size, diversity, quality, and type of social ties), overall and by race/ethnicity; 2) Evaluate
associations between immigrant status and multilevel social network characteristics with behavioral factors
known to influence BC survival (Western diet, soy and dairy consumption, MET-hours of physical activity,
amount and frequency of alcohol intake, current and pack years of smoking, obesity, and waist size), overall
and by race/ethnicity; and 3) Evaluate associations between immigrant status, multilevel social network
characteristics, and BC outcomes including recurrence, BC-specific mortality, and total mortality, overall and by
race/ethnicity, evaluating the degree to which social network characteristics and health behaviors mediate
associations. We will use meta-analytic techniques to evaluate study heterogeneity; linear, logistic, and
generalized linear mixed effects (multilevel) models to analyze associations in Aims 1 and 2; and multi-level
Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate associations in Aim 3. The unique convergence of detailed
data on immigrant status, race/ethnicity, multilevel social networks, highly detailed behavioral measures, and
BC outcomes, provides the first opportunity to examine the multilevel influence of social networks on health
behaviors and BC outcomes in diverse immigrant women with BC, adjusted for an extensive set of covariates.
This work is central to identifying factors underlying BC disparities in ethnically diverse immigrant women,
particularly those factors underlying favorable BC outcomes despite socioeconomic disadvantage."

Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death, contributing to 480,000 deaths in the U.S.
annually. Smoking alone causes 90% of all lung cancer-related deaths and 80% of all chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease-related deaths. Another 16 million people in the U.S. live with a disease caused by
smoking. Despite unknown long-term health effects, the increasing popularity of e-cigarettes (10.8 million
adults are current users) is a growing concern, especially given that this is the most popular form of tobacco
among youth. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number and variety of laws that preempt local
public policies. Preemption occurs when a higher level of government restricts or withdraws the authority of a
lower level of government to act on a particular issue, thereby prohibiting lower levels of government from
enacting more stringent laws. Preemptive laws are common on a variety of health issues, including tobacco.
For example, about 32 states had at least one form of preemption of local tobacco control ordinances as of
September 30, 2018. The laws vary by states in many aspects, including whether e-cigarettes are included.
Numerous stakeholders have concerns about the potential negative impacts of these laws. For instance, the
American Medical Association, the Institute of Medicine, and Healthy People 2020 have recognized
preemption law(s) as a barrier to public health. However, to date, there is no existing rigorous empirical
evidence on how, or if, these preemption laws affect local policy innovation and key health outcomes. The
proposed study will address these critical knowledge gaps by using a rigorous quasi-experimental design to
assess the impact of state preemption laws on tobacco and e-cigarette use. Specifically, we propose an
original systematic legal analysis to characterize and code state tobacco preemption laws as well as their
dimensions (Aim 1), assess the impact of state preemption laws on county smoke-free indoor policy (Aim 2),
cigarette smoking (Aim 3) and e-cigarette use (Aim 4). Aims 3 and 4 will also assess the heterogeneous
impact of state preemption laws among (a) subgroups (defined based on gender and race/ethnicity) and
whether the effects of these laws vary between (b) rural and urban communities. Our interdisciplinary team has
extensive experience in substance abuse epidemiology, quantitative analysis, policy and legal research. The
proposed research will address a severely understudied area with high public health significance: state
preemption laws functioning as a significant barrier to public health. This is an area of critical importance, as
the number and variety of preemption laws are increasing in the U.S. The results of this highly innovative study
will provide timely empirical evidence and have a sustained impact in informing future decision making on
preemptive policies and laws."

Immunization represents one of the most successful public health interventions in human history, preventing
more than 2 million deaths each year. Vaccine success depends on a variable combination of antibodies that
can neutralize the invading pathogen and virus-specific T cells that kill infected targets. However, the induction
of neutralizing antibodies and antiviral T cells that are sufficiently functional and broadly targeted to thwart a
highly mutable pathogen like HIV has proven exceptionally difficult in both humans and animal models. Thus,
there is currently no efficacious vaccine to prevent the nearly 5,000 new infections with HIV that occur each day.
This shortcoming in vaccine success is likely due to intrinsic immune regulatory mechanisms that limit the
quantity and quality of HIV-specific immune responses. Development of translational means to overcome these
immunological roadblocks holds great promise for advancement of next-generation vaccines to prevent HIV
infection and improve global health.
Our research focuses on the remarkable capacity of natural killer (NK) cells to suppress the magnitude and
quality of antiviral T and B cell responses triggered after immunization. NK cells impair the generation of
protective neutralizing antibody responses by inhibiting follicular helper T cell responses and restricting affinity
maturation of antibodies within germinal centers. This NK-cell immunosuppression also limits the quantity and
quality of antiviral memory T cell responses. NK cells achieve this suppressive effect via perforin-dependent
killing of activated T cells, although the specific receptors used to recognize target T cells and perforin-delivered
granzymes involved in triggering cell death remain incompletely defined. Whereas inhibition of perforin could
curtail NK cell-mediated immune suppression, this broad of an approach could temporarily undermine immunity
against pathogens and tumors, and thus a more refined approach targeting granzymes is proposed.
Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to advance an innovative high risk, high impact approach to foster HIV
vaccine efficacy through selective inhibition of granzymes involved in the immunosuppressive activity of NK cells.
Initial experiments in mice will use small molecule inhibitors and CRISPR to define the utility of targeting a specific
granzyme to limit NK-cell killing of T cells and suppression of vaccine-elicited adaptive immunity. Select inhibitors
will be validated in Rhesus macaques. Based on quantitatively defined go/no-go criteria establishing the success
of granzyme targeting to enhance vaccine efficacy, we will proceed to evaluation of this approach in vaccine-
mediated prevention of SIV infection in non-human primates. These experiments will also open impactful
avenues of investigation into the molecular features of both the immunosuppressive subset of NK cells and
targeted subpopulation of T cells. Thus, the proposed work will facilitate subsequent development and
deployment of innovative strategies to enhance HIV vaccine efficacy."
10872267,"Project Summary/Abstract
An HIV-1 (HIV) vaccine capable of eliciting broad and potent neutralizing antibody (Ab) response to HIV envelope
(Env) remains elusive. HIV has a high mutation rate, Env is highly glycosylated as well as conformationally
dynamic and, well-characterized broadly neutralizing responses reported to date have been generated after
chronic HIV infection, rather than by candidate HIV vaccines. Recently, we reported that precursor broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) can develop during early HIV infection and neutralization breadth was more
frequent when multiple HIV variants established infection in an individual, defined here as multiple-founder
variant (MFV) infection. Furthermore, Env diversity during initial infection was higher in individuals who
developed neutralization breadth. We concluded that Env-specific B cell development within one month of initial
HIV infection can predict neutralization breadth years later; this phenomenon highlights the critical importance
of these initial interactions, which prime B cells at the earliest stages of HIV infection. To determine the
immunogenicity of an HIV vaccine design based on the MFV concept, we formulated a cocktail of five Env trimer
proteins derived from MFV in acute infection. The Env sequences corresponded to 5 founder lineages in one
participant. They were further optimized by stabilizing them in a closed conformation using the ’Repair and
Stabilize’ strategy developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals. The cocktail of minimally distant, stabilized Env
proteins were formulated with the novel vaccine adjuvant, Army Liposome Formulation plus QS-21 (ALFQ).
Preliminary immunogenicity data in rabbits demonstrated that this vaccine candidate elicited a greater breadth
of neutralizing Ab responses than an equivalent total dose of a single stabilized Env trimer protein. These
minimally distant immunogens also elicited a higher magnitude of IgM responses to HIV; a predictor of
subsequent neutralization breadth in our studies of early infection. Therefore, we propose to select an optimal
combination of minimally distant HIV Env immunogens that mimic the diversity and development of neutralizing
Ab breadth seen in acute infections with MFV in vitro and in vivo. We will optimize the antigenicity of the HIV Env
trimer immunogens by comparing native stabilized trimers with Env trimers that have shortened hypervariable
(HV) loops and glycan modifications in an attempt to improve their antigenicity (Aim 1). We will optimize
immunogen delivery and display strategies, including multivalent trimeric Envs delivered as messenger RNA
(mRNA) and, multivalent immunogen display on self-assembling liposomal cobalt porphyrin phospholiposomes
(CoPoP) that afford Env base shielding (Aim 2). We will utilize pre-specified Go/No-Go criteria to downselect the
optimal vaccine regimen of optimized minimally distant HIV vaccine candidates, to evaluate protective immune
responses in non-human primate SHIV challenge studies (Aim 3). Our long-term goal is to develop a multivalent
HIV vaccine candidate that elicits protective broadly neutralizing Ab responses for subsequent manufacture and
evaluation in human clinical trials."

Despite the widespread availability of therapeutic agents, more than half of the 300 million people worldwide with
asthma have inadequate control of their disease resulting in an increased risk of exacerbations and a large
economic burden to the United States health care system. More effective and curative therapies are clearly
needed and will best be identified by increasing our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of asthma.
Allergy is a risk factor for the development of asthma, and most cases of asthma are allergic in origin. However,
not all individuals with systemic allergen sensitization develop asthma symptoms upon allergen exposure. These
allergic non-asthmatic individuals may develop allergic rhinitis in response to an allergen but do not have the
lower respiratory tract symptoms characteristic of asthma. Interestingly, many allergic non-asthmatic patients
will develop asthma symptoms over time, suggesting that the pathogenic mechanisms leading to asthma may
be incremental and reversible. Thus, determination of factors that differentiate the asthma phenotype in allergic
individuals could provide important insights into asthma pathogenesis and identify therapeutic targets. In health,
airway epithelial cells (AEC) and airway mononuclear phagocytes (MNP) help to maintain tissue homeostasis
and defend against pathogens. However, in asthma, AEC generate pro-inflammatory signals in response to
allergens that then initiates and propagates a type 2 immune response in the lung via activation of MNP. Our
published and preliminary studies demonstrate that the AEC and MNP have profoundly different reactions to
allergens in allergic asthmatics (AA) compared to allergic non-asthmatic controls (AC), including differential gene
expression and regulation of metabolic pathways, and an enhanced inflammatory response in allergic
asthmatics. These studies suggest that AEC and MNP can undergo epigenetic modifications and metabolic
reprogramming leading to a lasting immunological memory and enhanced response towards subsequent
exposures. This functional reprogramming is called trained immunity, and while it has been studied in the context
of infectious diseases, it has not been explored in the context of pulmonary inflammatory diseases such as
asthma. Our hypothesis is that AEC and airway MNP cells in allergic asthmatic individuals have a trained
immune response to allergens which drives the asthma phenotype. The specific aims are to: 1) Determine the
transcriptional accessibility of gene loci in AEC and airway MNP from allergic subjects with and without asthma.;
and 2) Compare the metabolic profile of AEC and airway MNP from allergic subjects with and without asthma.
We will utilize nasal brushings and bronchoscopy to directly sample AEC and MNP and bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid from AA and AC airways for single cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (scATAC-
seq) and metabolomics to determine if there are fundamental differences in the gene regulatory and metabolic
landscape of AEC and MNP between these groups."

Given the rapid evolution of genomic knowledge, the need for genomic reinterpretation has been increasing.
However, there is no standard approach yet to identifying to whom, when, and how reinterpretation should be
provided to ensure accuracy, cost-effectiveness and fairness. Access to genomic tests and genetic specialists
has widened health disparities, which could be further exacerbated by limited ancestry-specific genetic data. Our
overarching goal is to design a scalable and sustainable informatics framework to support continuous genomic
reanalysis for symptomatic patients with non-diagnostic exome or genome sequencing in diverse populations.
Extending our prior published work on Doc2HPO, Criteria2Query, Phen2Gene, PhenCards, Phenominal, and
phenotype-disease knowledge graphs, we will first develop a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to
create a multimodal phenome from clinical notes using the latest Phenopacket schema. By comparing changes
in longitudinal EHR phenotypes over time and analyzing the changes in the context of the new evidence for
variants, we will identify individuals who can benefit most from genomic reanalysis. Then we will incorporate
evolving clinical phenotypes extracted from longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data to trigger automatic
variant reinterpretation using an ancestry-aware and age-sensitive knowledge graph (PhenoKG). Unlike typical
phenotype-based gene prioritization tools such as Phen2Gene, here we will build the knowledge graph by
extending our previous efforts and extracting phenotype-genotype relations from the EHR as well as the
literature. This knowledge graph will enable the query, extraction and inference of ancestry-aware, as well as
age-sensitive, phenotype-genotype relationships. By leveraging a multi-layer random-walk integrative network
approach, we will incorporate this heterogeneous knowledge graph into a phenotype-driven gene and variant
prioritization algorithm for continuous genomic reanalysis across diverse populations. With these methodological
developments, we will implement a routine reanalysis informatics pipeline at two academic institutions, Columbia
University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). We will evaluate the
improvements in diagnostic yield across a diverse set of clinical exome/genome sequencing data over a 3-year
period. We will evaluate how our approach to fair phenotyping and continuous variant reinterpretation can reduce
genomic health disparities for underserved and underrepresented populations. Ultimately, these methods will
enable informatics-driven, efficient, scalable, continuous and fair genomic diagnostics for genomic medicine via
continuous genomic variant reinterpretation."

Dysregulation of myelopoiesis can be either cell-intrinsic or cell-extrinsic. Cell-intrinsic mutations can result in
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) or myeloproliferative disorders (MPNs), while cell-extrinsic systemic
inflammation promotes emergency myelopoiesis. However, the cause of the enhanced myelopoiesis is not
always clear, and these two mechanisms are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Patients with chronic
inflammation or autoimmune disease are at an increased risk for MDS, and chronic inflammation is often
observed in MDS patients. Provocatively, our preliminary data demonstrates that a cell-extrinsic emergency
myelopoiesis progressively develops when the inner mitochondrial membrane transporter ABCB7 is
conditionally deleted in differentiating B cells in the bone marrow. ABCB7 is intrinsically required for B cell
development beyond the pro-B cell stage. In 4-5 month old mice engineered to lack ABCB7 in B-lineage cells,
bone marrow hematopoiesis is disrupted. Bone marrow erythropoiesis is dramatically reduced, and bone
marrow myelopoiesis is greatly enhanced. To compensate for the loss of bone marrow marrow erythropoiesis,
stress erythropoiesis is initiated in the spleen, however, the mice remain anemic. Importantly, the enhanced
numbers of myeloid cells being produced in the bone marrow were not labelled with a cre-dependent reporter,
establishing that the myeloid expansion is cell-extrinsic. ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells exhibit iron overload and
DNA damage, which could provide the stimuli for initiation of chronic inflammation leading to progressive cell-
extrinsic emergency myelopoiesis. Intriguingly, ABCB7 expression is decreased in myelodysplastic disorders
in which patients have a mutation in the RNA splicing gene SF3B1. ABCB7 RNA levels are decreased by 60-
70% in SF3B1-mutated CD34+ cells from MDS-RS patients due to aberrant splicing and nonsense-mediated
decay. We hypothesize that myelodysplasia in patients with SF3B1-mutated myelodysplastic disorders is not
strictly cell-intrinsic, but instead there is a cell-extrinsic contribution mediated by decreased expression of
ABCB7 in B-lineage precursor cells. To test this hypothesis, we have created a novel dox-regulated ABCB7
mouse model that allows us to address the hematopoietic consequences of decreased ABCB7 expression.
These studies will establish that reduced expression of ABCB7, in both mouse and human hematopoiesis,
leads to dysfunctional myelopoiesis due to B-lineage cells. Our studies will have important therapeutic
implications for treating SF3B1-mutated myeloid disorders, as elimination of the B-lineage cells could
contribute to amelioration of disease."
10896302,"The ultimate research goal of this lab is to decipher the gene regulatory network that directs the development of
various types of neurons in the mouse arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC). Despite the physiological
significance of many ARC neurons, the developmental gene regulatory programs for ARC neurons remain poorly
understood. This lab has been pioneering this emerging area of studies by successfully combining mouse
genetics and genome-wide studies. Notably, a close developmental link has been discovered among different
types of ARC neurons. These intertwined developmental pathways are likely crucial to ensure the balanced
production of different ARC neurons during embryogenesis, enabling a highly coordinated regulation of various
homeostatic processes in later postnatal life, such as integration of feeding, reproduction, and growth.
 Key preliminary results in this grant include: i) Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analyses reveal eight TFs
enriched in developing growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH)-neurons in the ARC, which control linear
growth; Prox1, Gsx1, Egr1, Foxp2, Pbx3, St18, Dlx1 and Dlx2. Notably, Dlx1/2, Foxp2 and Gsx1 have been
shown to be important for the development of GHRH-neurons, indicating that the scRNA-seq approach is highly
useful to identify TFs acting on neuronal lineage development. ii) GHRH-specific inactivation of Prox1 leads to
dwarfism and reduced Ghrh expression in mice. iii) Further, ChIP-seq data for Dlx1 provides various new insights
into the mechanism by which Dlx1 controls GHRH-neuronal development. Together, these results led to the
central hypothesis Dlx1/2 and Prox1 play vital roles in acquiring GHRH-neuronal fate over other related
ARC neuronal lineages in part by coordinating the expression of downstream TFs. This hypothesis will be
tested in the two specific aims using an ensemble of biochemical and cellular methods, mouse genetics and
genome-wide approaches. Completion of this innovative study will radically improve the understanding of how
common progenitors are guided to gain a specific ARC lineage identity over other related cell fates, providing a
critical mechanism contributing to the balanced production of diverse ARC neuronal types during development."

Most of the current focus in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) research has been based on identifying key
brain regions, relevant signaling pathways and selective brain circuits that give rise to overt behavioral and
internal neuronal states Interestingly, we have recently found that that specific gut microbes can modulate brain
function and behaviors in an amazingly powerful way via the gut-brain axis. Here we will combine state-of-the-
art transcriptomics, metabolomics, pharmacology, microbiology, genetics, metagenomics, electrophysiology and
behavior to identify the mechanism(s) by which a gut microbe (L. reuteri) reverses the social deficits in NDD
mouse models. Briefly, we will define the molecular and genetic mechanism by which L. reuteri and L. reuteri-
induced metabolites promote social behavior and related changes in synaptic function. In addition, we will identify
the mode of gut-brain communication (‘gut-brain axis’) by which L. reuteri and L. reuteri-induced metabolites
modulate brain function and behavior. Finally, we will assess the broader therapeutic potential for L. reuteri-
induced metabolites in different models for NDDs with social dysfunction. Our findings could not only provide a
new holistic dimension of how behaviors and the brain are controlled by gut microbes, but they could also lead
to the development of new non-invasive microbial-based therapies for NDDs."

The loss of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas results in an absolute requirement for injected insulin,
causing significant risks of mortality from hypoglycemia and morbidity from diabetic complications in peripheral
nerves, the retina, the heart, and the kidney. A key goal of efforts to treat T1D is to stop this cellular attack, either
by halting the immune mis-recognition of beta cells or by protecting beta cells from cell death. However, a critical
barrier to progress in the field is a lack of complete understanding of the cellular events in the islet that contribute
to the loss of beta-cell mass. Using a phenotypic screening approach, we discovered BRD0476, a compound
that is selectively active against cytokine-mediated apoptosis. Further study of this compound revealed that it
binds the deubiquitinase USP9X to halt JAK2 and STAT1 signaling in response to IFNγ. We determined that
JAK2 can be rendered signaling incompetent by ubiquitination, and that by modulating USP9X, we can tip the
balance toward reduced JAK2 kinase activity, even in the presence of IFNγ. These results point to an emerging
role for ubiquitination in regulating beta-cell apoptosis in T1D, and suggest that a greater understanding of this
process (and its potential dysregulation) in the early stages of T1D development could lead to 1) the ability to
identify at-risk individuals, and 2) novel therapeutic strategies to preserve beta-cell mass in early-stage T1D.
Using our probe BRD0476 and chemical biology tools not previously applied to islet biology, we will improve our
understanding of the role of USP9X in beta-cell survival in vitro and in vivo through the following aims: In Aim 1,
we will characterize the mode of JAK2 inhibition by USP9X in human islets. In Aim 2, we will assess effects of
inhibiting USP9X-JAK2 (with BRD0476) on development and progression of autoimmune diabetes in a mouse
model of type 1 diabetes. In Aim 3, we will profile deubiquitinase (DUB) expression and activity in human islets
during early T1D development, using activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) and global ubiquitome
measurements. The successful outcomes of this proposal are 1) a greater understanding of mechanisms to
promote beta-cell survival in early T1D, and 2) a chemical probe to provide translational proof-of-concept. This
project will set the stage for developing a biomarker of early-stage T1D development, as well as advanced
therapeutic strategies for preventing beta-cell apoptosis in early-stage T1D, representing a potentially curative
approach."

Noradrenergic and cholinergic mechanisms underlying pupil-linked arousal modulation of thalamic
sensory processing
Behavioral state, including attention and arousal, exerts heavy influences on neural representation, perception,
cognition, and behavioral performance and is regulated by several neuromodulatory systems, including the
locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system and the cholinergic system. Abnormal activity in the LC-NE
and cholinergic systems has been implicated in major clinical disorders that affect millions of people, including
schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease (PD), and depression. Non-luminance mediated changes in pupil size have
been known to co-vary with mental processing underlying behavior for decades. Recent work highlighted that
pupil dynamics were able to track rapid fluctuation of cortical arousal state. Therefore, changes in pupil size
under constant illumination have been widely used as a non-invasive read out of the activation of certain
central arousal circuits, and thus are used to index pupil-linked arousal. Atypical pupil dynamics have been
reported in the aforementioned neurological disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying modulation of
information processing in the brain by pupil-linked arousal remain little known. The proposed project will test
our central hypothesis: pupil-linked arousal modulates thalamic sensory processing and perceptual behavior
through both adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. We focus on the thalamus in this project because most
information about the external world reaches the cerebral cortex through the thalamus, and the thalamus plays
a critical role in gating information to the cortex. Using a synthesis of electrophysiology, genetic manipulations,
and behavioral paradigms, we will test this hypothesis in three Aims. Aim 1 will focus on characterization of the
extent to which thalamic sensory processing and its contribution to perception depend on pupil-linked arousal.
Aim 2 will examine the extent to which norepinephrine and acetylcholine (ACh) dynamics in the thalamus can
be tracked by pupil size. Aim 3 will develop cutting-edge genetic tools based on CRISPR/Cas9 + guide RNA
technology to selectively knock out each subtype of adrenergic and cholinergic receptor in the thalamus.
Further, we will characterize the role of each subtype of NE/Ach receptor in mediating pupil-linked arousal
modulation of sensory processing and perceptual behavior. This project will provide much-needed insight
about how the LC-NE and cholinergic systems contribute to pupil-linked arousal modulation of
thalamic processing of sensory information and perception. Such information is essential to better understand
neurological disorders in which abnormal thalamic activity and pupil dynamics have been reported."

Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) adults are at greater risk for alcohol use, alcohol-related problems, and alcohol use
disorders relative to cisgender adults. Thus, having culturally-competent alcohol use assessments and interventions that
effectively target salient risks within this population is critical from a public health perspective. Yet, despite increased
attention on this vulnerable population, extant theory concerning alcohol risk and resilience within TGD populations
suffers from numerous theoretical and methodological limitations. This includes (a) a narrow perspective of risk that fails
to consider the incremental validity of different stressors facing TGD adults, (b) the operationalization of risk within
racially homogeneous, White samples that may not capture risks and strengths relevant in racially, ethnically, and
sexually diverse samples, and (c) reliance on quantitative approaches that fail to facilitate the translation of indices of
alcohol use within TGD communities into clinical protocols. Addressing these limitations is the answer to laying the
foundation for more culturally affirming and clinically useful models for explaining and intervening with alcohol use in
TGD populations. Our study is consistent with NOT-MD-19-001, “Notice of Special Interest in Research on the
Health of Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM) Populations.”
The proposed study seeks to address these aims via a novel, mixed method research approach. In the first phase of the
study, we will conduct secondary data analyses on a large, diverse sample of TGD adults (N=27,715; U.S. Transgender
Survey) to examine which minority stress experiences in the empirical literature are robust predictors of alcohol use
across gender identities (e.g., non-binary, trans men, trans women) and intersecting identities (e.g., race, ethnicity, sexual
orientation). Our analytic plan will use a multi-level modeling approach (i.e., MAIHDA models) to better capture the
influence of intersecting identities on risk, as well as an evidence-based medicine (EBM) approach to demonstrate the
clinical utility and statistical fairness of an alcohol use risk algorithm informed by minority stress theory for TGD adults.
In the second phase of the study, qualitative interviews will be conducted with 60 TGD, drinking adults, to gain
perspectives on top-down minority stress theories tested in Phase I, as well as other salient risks, needs, and strengths
missing from current conceptualizations of alcohol use within the TGD community. The sample will be stratified by
gender identity, race, and ethnicity to ensure a representative perspective on the environmental events and dynamic
processes most salient to TGD adults’ perspectives on problematic alcohol use. Collective findings from our study will
inform an R34 application that focuses on developing a TGD-affirming alcohol intervention."

Chromogranin A (CgA) is a component of dense core vesicles of endocrine and neuroendocrine cells and
neurons that control the storage of neurotransmitters and hormones. CgA is a prohormone which is
processed into peptide hormones with distinct biological functions. Two of these peptides, catestatin (CST:
hCgA352-372) and pancreastatin (PST: hCgA250-301), exhibit diametrically opposite functions: CST is anti-
hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic, whereas PST is pro-inflammatory, pro-hypertensive and
pro-diabetic. High levels of CgA are present in the blood of patients with malignancies, inflammatory
diseases, and neurological disorders, and their levels rise as their clinical conditions worsen. Although Chga
(gene encoding CgA)-null mice have been available for nearly 20 years and have been widely studied, the
impact of CgA on aging has not been investigated. We found that CgA-KO mice develop hypertension at a
young age, but it reverses beyond the age of 12 months. We also noted that a few unused CgA-KO mice (all
male) that were kept aside lived at least 40 months. We also found that mRNA levels of lipoprotein lipase
(LPL), which controls triglyceride levels and V-set and immunoglobulin domain containing 4 (Vsig4), which
control bacterial clearance via autophagy, are low in the heart and liver of CgA-KO young mice but high in
old mice. We further found that leakage of bacterial DNA to other different organs in older WT mice. These
preliminary observations imply that CgA is an aging-inducing factor, but it has a positive role at early
ages through maintenance of lipid metabolism. We propose that differential processing of CgA into CST
and PST would determine aging through regulation of factors involved in metabolism and inflammation. This
proposal aims to investigate the validity of our hypothesis by assessing the lifespan, growth, mitochondrial
health, energy expenditure of a larger cohort of WT and CgA-KO males and females. We will further
determine the factors critical for CgA-induced aging and the pathways involved in the spontaneous reversal
of hypertension and lifespan extension of CgA-KO mice with emphasis on the lipoprotein-adipokine,
catecholamine-adrenergic receptor and Vsig-4-autophagy signaling axes in four different tissues.
 The proposed research will be led by two Co-PIs: Dr. Mahata, a physiologist whose research focuses
on hypertension, insulin resistance and immunometabolism, and Dr. Ghosh, a biochemist who studies
inflammatory responses through the IKK-NF-B signaling pathways. If the hypotheses prove to be correct,
long-term studies to determine the underlying mechanisms of CgA-induced aging will be conducted.
Experiments proposed here will also help to determine if CgA can be targeted for therapy against
inflammatory disorders, aging-related and neurological disorders by lowering CgA transcripts at an older age
to reduce the pathogenic repercussions."
10930020,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel b-coronavirus identified in 2019 that causes the disease COVID-19, which is responsible for over 6 million deaths since late 2019. While recent virology studies have clarified many aspects of how SARS- CoV-2 infects cells and causes disease, questions remain on the spatio-temporal processes of post-entry replication steps, which may be useful for targeting novel therapies. Using reverse genetics and live cell and super-resolution microscopy of labeled SARS-CoV-2 proteins expressed in cells or during SARS-CoV-2 infection, we propose two aims to gain better understanding of virus-host interactions during infection of human airway cells. We will understand the role of host proteins in the biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-induced double- membraned vesicles (Aim 1) and visualize the origin and trafficking of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis (Aim 2) for WT virus and variants of concern (e.g., Alpha, Delta, and Omicron). The studies will be performed in real-time in human airway epithelial cell lines and deidentified primary cells. These aims will be performed by fluorescently labeling SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the viral RNA as well as host cell proteins. Small molecules, knock down of host factors, and mutations in the viral genome (including those found in highly circulating variants) will be used to alter these processes and, thus, infectivity to study replication mechanisms. In addition, correlative light- electron microscopy (CLEM) will provide structural information on these replication processes. Improved understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to more effective COVID-19 therapies for infected individuals and could prepare us for preventing or treating new coronaviruses that arise in the future."
10817942,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This mentored research scientist development award will allow the candidate, Dr. Ryan Phillips, to establish an
independent research career focused on understanding the complex circuit interactions that link pain and
respiration. The training plan outlined in this award, combined with the candidate's background in brainstem pain
circuits and computational modelling, make him ideally suited to successfully follow this career path. Opioid
receptors are expressed in multiple brainstem regions that regulate pain and respiration, and the link between
opioid-induced analgesia and respiratory depression poses a major clinical challenge. Indeed, the often difficult
to predict side-effect of opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) is the leading cause of opioid-related
deaths driving the current opioid epidemic. Despite this public health significance, the mechanisms underlying
OIRD are not fully understood and therapeutic strategies to prevent or reverse OIRD while maintaining analgesia
are limited. A natural idea is that OIRD results from direct effects of opioids on respiratory rhythm-generating
neurons of the pre-Bötzinger Complex (preBötC) in the ventral medulla. Although some preBötC neurons do
express µ-opioid receptors (µORs), encoded by the Oprm1 gene, systemic opioids continue to produce
respiratory depression and apneas even after genetic deletion of µORs in this population. Importantly, the
contributions other µORs/Oprm1 expressing respiratory- and pain-related neurocircuitries to OIRD have been
described. These brainstem regions, including the parabrachial (PB), Kolliker Fuse (KF), and rostral ventromedial
medulla (RVM), all have important roles in regulating the respiratory rhythm generated by the preBötC. However,
how opioids alter the network dynamics of these interacting regions remains unknown. We hypothesize that
interruption of opioid sensitive network interactions is a major mechanism underlying OIRD caused by systemic
opioids. This hypothesis will be tested using computational modeling and experimental approaches performed
in tandem. Computational modeling has played a significant role in advancing the field of respiratory
neurobiology and is ideally suited for examining the implications of disparate datasets and for low-cost, high
throughput testing of hypothesized network features. In addition to existing data, our model will be guided and
constrained by new cell-type- and projection- specific experimental manipulations in vivo that will constitute a
significant training aspect of this award. By combining these strategies, our data-driven computational model will
yield novel insights into the network dynamics that underlie opioid-induced respiratory depression as well as
potential therapeutic targets to generate pain relief without respiratory side effects."
10929943,"Project Summary/Abstract
People with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) experience barriers to care and a lower quality of life (QOL). FASD-
informed services and supports are lacking, especially during the transition to adulthood – a critical developmental period
for QOL. The proposed project will develop and initiate testing of a scalable person-centered planning (PCP) intervention
to support QOL for adolescents and adults with FASD. PCP is an evidence-based intervention for people with disabilities.
Research suggests PCP is a good fit FASD; however, it has yet to be adapted or tested with this population. In this project,
we will use rigorous implementation science frameworks to systematically adapt and test a PCP intervention for
adolescents and adults with FASD. Given the importance of social support networks in PCP, we will also draw upon the
growing literature and team expertise on social network interventions to inform the development and evaluation of the
intervention. Consistent with other interventions in our lab, we expect the proposed intervention to leverage technology to
offer scalable solutions to overcome current barriers to care. During the R61 phase of the project, we will use the
implementation science framework “Intervention Mapping – Adapt” to carefully adapt the core principles and methods of
PCP and social network interventions for FASD. This 6-step process involves a planning team of people with FASD and
other stakeholders and careful attention to theory and logic models to guide adaptation decisions. Based on our
preliminary logic models, self-determination theory is a strong fit with the proposed intervention that we are currently
calling “Thrive.” Additional research activities in Aim 1 will also inform the planning group’s decision making as they
refine logic models, determine intervention structure and components, develop materials, and finalize evaluation
procedures. Specifically in Aim 1a, we will conduct individual and group interviews with adolescents and adults with
FASD and members of their social networks to characterize key features of their support networks that may be amenable
to intervention. Following initial production of intervention materials, we will complete two rounds of usability testing (5
participants per round) in Aim 1b to aid in refining intervention materials and evaluation procedures for the pilot
randomized controlled trial (RCT) in the R33 phase. Following successful attainment of R61 milestones, we will conduct
a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation pilot RCT of the developed Thrive intervention (R33). This trial design
involves gathering data on both effectiveness and implementation outcomes, which will help us optimize the intervention
for future larger-scale trials and more rapid translation into community settings. We will recruit 60 adolescents and adults
(ages 15-30) with FASD to participate in the pilot RCT, with random assignment to the 1) Thrive PCP intervention or 2)
comparison group receiving social network and strengths assessments only. Although significance testing and effect sizes
will be calculated, a larger emphasis will be placed on feasibility to guide the design of a fully powered larger-scale RCT
R01 application. For example, in addition to the feasibility of the intervention itself, we will assess feasibility of
recruitment and trial procedures, sensitivity of measures to intervention change, and intervention process. Our proposed
PCP intervention has high potential to improve QOL of people with FASD at the critical transition to adulthood."
10913632,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 I propose to functionally interrogate mechanisms of cancer immune evasion and immunotherapy resistance
in powerful new mouse models of colorectal cancer (CRC). Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has
revolutionized treatment of multiple solid tumor types but is nevertheless ineffective in most cancers. I
hypothesize that this is due in part to distinct programs of T cell dysfunction that respond poorly to ICB, such
as that programmed by suboptimal T cell priming. While microsatellite instable (MSI) CRC responds remarkably
well to ICB, likely due to a high burden of mutation-derived antigens (neoantigens), most CRC (~88%) is
microsatellite stable (MSS) and does not respond. However, MSS CRC is characterized by a higher burden of
mutations than other solid tumor types that do respond to ICB, like kidney cancer. My own analysis of human
MSS CRC sequencing revealed that all tumors expressed at least two clonal neoantigens with strong predicted
binding to HLA-I, but that these neoantigens were expressed at significantly lower levels than those in MSI CRC.
This suggests that neoantigen expression levels, in addition to burden, may play an important role in the
antitumor T cell response. To test this, I developed a colonoscopy-guided orthotopic transplant model of CRC
employing isogenic organoids with varying levels of expression of model CD8+ T cell neoantigens. High
expression resulted in organoid rejection, while low expression resulted in poor T cell priming with immediate
dysfunction and tumor escape. Tumor infiltrating T cells in my low neoantigen-expressing model and human
MSS CRC showed signatures of tolerogenic dysfunction, distinct from canonical “exhaustion” and consistent
with suboptimal priming. These analyses also identified the orphan nuclear receptor 4A subfamily genes Nr4a1,
Nr4a2, and Nr4a3—an exciting new class of T cell checkpoint—as potentially central mediators of this process.
 Aim 1 will functionally interrogate Nr4a1-3 in T cell priming and dysfunction and investigate their potential as
therapeutic targets in CRC. Aim 2 will determine whether existing therapies that boost T cell priming (CD40
agonism, vaccination) can rescue suboptimal T cell priming in CRC and delineate T cell intrinsic and extrinsic
mechanisms of efficacy and resistance. The overarching goal of these aims is to deepen our mechanistic
understanding of non-canonical T cell dysfunction in CRC and identify new therapeutic strategies to reverse it.
This holds substantial promise for the majority of CRC and other cancers that do not respond to ICB and may
guide novel combination clinical trials. This proposal is innovative in bringing together cutting-edge mouse
models of cancer and advanced tools in immunology. Its completion should bring clarity to the outstanding
question of why CRC, the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, is generally nonresponsive to
current immunotherapies. The K22 award will help me execute these aims and generate preliminary data that
will form a foundation for competitive R01 applications, publications, and a successful independent research
program, as well as give me the flexibility to augment my immunology training through NASDC course offerings."

Adolescent depression is highly prevalent, impairing, costly, and associated with risk of suicide. Though universal
screening for adolescent depression is recommended in pediatric primary care, primary care providers report
limited time and few resources to manage mental health concerns in that setting. Short sleep duration and sleep-
wake irregularity are consistently and significantly associated with adolescent depression and are considered
key mechanisms of disease; thus, these sleep parameters are critical intervention targets for depressed youth.
Efficacious behavioral strategies for disturbed adolescent sleep and daily rhythms lead to improved sleep and
depression. However, little work has translated what is efficacious in a research environment for use in pediatric
primary care, even though integrated behavioral health in primary care is rapidly expanding and associated with
improved patient outcomes. We developed a brief, scalable, behavioral Sleep Promotion Program (SPP) for
adolescents with short sleep duration and sleep-wake irregularity, which relies on one individual session and
smartphone technology to deliver evidence-based strategies. In response to PAR-21-131, in this R34 we
propose 1) translating SPP for implementation in pediatric primary care, including optimizing the smartphone
features for depressed adolescents and 2) developing feasible and acceptable provider training. After refining
our procedures through an open trial, we will 3) test the feasibility and 4) initial effectiveness of the SPP program
and provider training via pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT); and 5) identify factors that facilitate and impede
implementation. We will first conduct interviews with depressed adolescents and staff/providers who work in
pediatric primary care (n=12 each group). Interviews will focus on barriers to implementation in primary care;
developing feasible and acceptable provider training; and enhancing engagement in SPP smartphone
technology components among depressed youth. We will conduct an open trial (n=8) to iteratively refine provider
training, implementation procedures, and SPP program, per participant and staff feedback. We will then conduct
a pilot RCT (n=50) comparing SPP to Sleep Psychoeducation, a brief session on healthy sleep habits.
Participants will be adolescents (12-18 years) with short sleep duration, sleep-wake irregularity, and depression;
these features will also serve as primary outcomes assessed at baseline, post-intervention and 3-month follow-
up. We will measure changes in provider sleep knowledge and capacity to deliver SPP. We hypothesize SPP
program and provider training procedures will be feasible, acceptable, and appropriate. We hypothesize greater
improvements in sleep duration, sleep-wake regularity and depressive symptoms among youth receiving SPP.
Provider sleep knowledge will significantly improve and treatment integrity will be reached. Feedback from youth
and providers involved in the RCT will help to identify implementation factors. This R34 will enhance the
relevance of effectiveness and implementation research via deployment-focused studies, consistent with NIMH
Strategic Plan Objective 3.3.C, and will inform a larger trial testing the effectiveness and implementation of SPP."

The primary goal of the Administrative Core (Core C) is to support and promote the program and data
management goals of this TBRU. Amongst its responsibilities, Core C will provide leadership that ensures
strong oversight and representation of all the Core and Affiliate Researchers in decisions, facilitate integration
of research projects, and connect with other TB Research Units and the broader infectious disease community.
We will form an internal Program Leadership Team (PLT) consisting of the Co-Investigators, who will regularly
evaluate progress of the Projects and Cores. We will identify needs as they arise, as well as review and
possibly modify priorities and research directions. We will implement these efforts with two Aims in Program
Management and Data Management. The Program Management plan includes administrative structure and
governance, communication, financial management, regulatory compliance, and evaluation. The Core C Data
Management Plan will guide management of data across all study sites. A vital activity of Core C will be to
facilitate communication amongst the TBRU members located around the world and with the other members of
the community and will organize and manage a number of regularly scheduled meetings, some specifically for
members of the PLT and others for the entire research team. These various meetings will provide important
opportunities to share and discuss overall research directions and specific experimental concerns. The Core
will plan yearly workshops which will feature talks by all TBRU faculty members as well as presentations from
other members of the infectious disease community. Core C will lead the maintenance of the TBRU Center
website and shared file servers. To provide formal site review and involvement with NIH, the Core will organize
an annual External Scientific Advisory Group Meeting, in which the MPIs and key personnel will meet with NIH
program staff to review activities. Overall, the Administrative Core will ensure that projects are productive,

new tools, such as a vaccine, drugs and treatment regimes, and a point-of-care test are required. New tools to
eliminate TB are reliant on new knowledge of TB. Here we are utilizing genomic technology to interrogate
pathogen and host genomic variation in TB to advance our fundamental understanding of TB which is critically
required to drive innovation for the design of new vaccines and drugs to control the TB epidemic.
We will utilize our extensive clinical, epidemiological and genetic cohorts from Vietnam and Uganda which
have been complied over the last 2 decades, to discover genetic determinants of TB disease, progression and
outcome in humans and M.tuberculosis. We aim to 1/ identify genetic determinants of active pulmonary TB
disease in humans and M.tb, 2/ identify genetic determinants in humans and M.tb associated with bacterial
burden and poor disease outcome 3/ identify bacterial variants associated with transmission, using
evolutionary and epidemiological signatures of transmission. In aims 1 and 2 we will utilize a paired host and
pathogen genomic dataset from a large cohort of pulmonary TB patients, and analyze both host and pathogen
genomic data individually and in combination. In these aims we will investigate host and pathogen gene
variants associated with TB disease and clinical endpoints, as well as with “intermediate phenotypes” such as
host control of bacterial replication, bacterial survival in the host, and bacterial clearance. In aim 3 we will use
bacterial genome sequence to identify Mtb gene variants contributing to disease transmissibility by 1/
interrogating genomic signals of evolution and 2/ by utilizing epidemiological data of households with low and
high TB transmission. The aims of core A Genetics will deliver gene discoveries to the 3 projects for functional
analysis, while functional candidates identified in the 3 projects using in vitro and in vivo models will be
assessed within our clinical cohorts to bridge the “investigative” gap between TB disease models and human

The overall goal of the Latino Core is to support high quality, cutting edge, research projects on the etiology,
pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) by
providing data and biospecimens from well-characterized, longitudinally followed Latinos who initially enroll
without dementia from the community. Latinos are at greater risk of ADRD than non-Latino Whites, but the field
has struggled to engage this population in clinical research. In response to the NAPA milestones on health
disparities/equity, our Latino Core will support studies that assess the epidemiology, and mechanistic pathways
of disparities in health burden of ADRD, and facilitate engagement, understanding, and partnership with our
diverse participants using culturally-tailored approaches and research efforts to understand and advance the
science of disparities. Despite the existence of large, productive studies that include Latinos, progress in the
field has been hampered by a critical lack of brain tissue from well characterized older Latinos without
dementia. Moreover, there is limited data regarding cognitive decline and transitions from normal aging to mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia among older Latinos; and few studies have examined blood
biomarker differences across race/ethnicity. Building on our history of success and experience working with
underserved communities, the Latino Core is poised to fill a critical gap in our knowledge base, and accelerate
research in health disparities by providing resources, including participants, clinical data, and ante- and

The goal of this U19 application is to understand how internal states influence decision behavior
and brainwide neural activity, across multiple timescales, by bringing together experimental and
theoretical researchers who are already part of an established collaboration, the International
Brain Laboratory. To enable these diverse groups to work together smoothly and achieve our
scientific goals, the IBL has developed proven, effective methods for collaboration across multiple
institutions and time zones, which the U19 team will use to ensure successful completion of the
scientific aims.
 The Administrative Core will coordinate all U19 program functions; provide rigorous fiscal
oversight of research projects and cores; guide and facilitate interactions among project and core
leaders, principal investigators, and research staff; and facilitate data sharing and collaboration
with key stakeholders and the broader neuroscience community. In addition, we will provide
administrative and fiscal support to enable projects and cores to make efficient use of U19
resources. The core will track the quality and productivity of IBL U19 team members, monitor and
ensure timely processing of all financial transactions, manage the subawards to partner
universities, and coordinate yearly progress reporting to NIH. This core will also arbitrate resource
allocation and assist with conflict resolution if required. Finally, we will convene an External
Scientific Advisory Board composed of experienced research scientists with proven leadership to
oversee the U19 program’s infrastructure, scientific direction, and development of resources for
the research community.
 Moreover, the Administrative Core will provide structure and guidance to ensure strong
communication among core and project leaders and participants, thus ensuring integration of the

10906277,"Summary/Abstract (Data Science Core B)
This project—and the International Brain Laboratory (IBL) more generally—represents a tightly closed loop of
experiment, theory, and data analysis. This loop depends critically on sophisticated, scalable, and robust data
science resources and methods. This core will provide these resources and methods.
 First, this core will extend the existing IBL data architecture to handle the new datasets that will be
collected as part of this project (Aim 1). IBL already uses this data architecture daily to collect experimental data
(including behavioral video and Neuropixels recordings) and metadata; automatically preprocess and analyze
the data; automatically transfer the data to a central server; and share the results within the collaboration and
externally. This core will extend this architecture to handle the new experiments and data types (calcium imaging,
functional ultrasound imaging, optogenetic perturbations, in situ sequencing) to be pursued here.
 Second, this Core will apply and refine sophisticated data-analysis algorithms directly related to the
project’s scientific goals, and serve these algorithms publicly as open-source tools to the broader community
(Aim 2). IBL already has good working pipelines in place to preprocess (spike sort) Neuropixels datasets. During
the proposed project, this core will continue to refine and improve these spike-sorting pipelines, incorporate new
pipelines to handle additional large data types (calcium imaging and in situ sequencing data) that are not
currently in place in the IBL infrastructure, and support development of methods for analyzing large-scale multi-
neuronal recordings from multiple brain areas over multiple experiments. All analytical and data-architecture
tools will be versioned, open-source, and immediately available for use and development by other laboratories.
A major synergistic aspect of IBL is that these pipelines will be heavily internally tested by many users with a
wide variety of expertise across multiple labs. These tools will also be served on the Neuroscience Cloud
Analysis as a Service platform to facilitate reproducible, easy usage. We thus expect the availability of these
new tools to have an immediate and broad impact on the field."
10906282,"Summary/Abstract, Core C: Histology
The overall goal of this U19 application is to determine the brainwide neural basis and behavioral consequences
of internal states, such as task engagement, as mice perform a standardized decision-making task. Registration
of electrophysiological recording sites into a common anatomical framework represents a critical step in
comparing these experiments across projects and synthesizing the results into a theoretical model, so an
accurate and robust histological and image analysis methodology is essential for the development of high-quality,
reproducible datasets.
Histology Core C therefore aims to deliver two key outcomes. First, this core will centralize and standardize
histology data acquisition and registration to a reference atlas across experimental Projects 1, 2, and 4. Through
previous work by groups participating in this proposal, the anatomical reconstruction and registration pipeline for
recordings with Neuropixels probes using serial-section two-photon imaging has been established, optimized,
and validated. This core will develop an open-source software package for sample registration to the Allen mouse
brain common coordinate framework, version 3 (CCF). This package will include functions for assessing
registration quality, and will be extended to handle new experimental recording methods as needed for the
proposed experiments, including the reconstruction and registration of labeled cells investigated with calcium
imaging, the registration of functional ultrasound imaging data onto the Allen CCF, and the reconstruction of
cells, pathways, and optic fiber insertion sites in fiber photometry and optogenetic stimulation experiments.
Second, to support the additional experimental aims proposed in this application, particularly optogenetic
perturbations in Project 2 and calcium imaging in Project 4, this core will develop clearing and histological labeling
protocols to interrogate nervous system structure.
Many of the technical hurdles to delivering these aims have already been overcome. The centralizing of
histological processing in the International Brain Laboratory consortium is well established, and a first version of
this open-source software is in its final stages of development. A whole-brain tissue clearing and lightsheet
imaging methodology has been demonstrated, and its reliable registration to the common framework is under
assessment. A range of histological procedures that can immunohistochemically label large blocks of tissue are
available, and will form the basis for further histological interrogation. In conclusion, Histology Core C will perform
the essential tasks of processing mouse brains for histological reconstruction, generating structural datasets
from this tissue in close collaboration with U19 projects, and supplying the resulting protocols, software tools,
and datasets to the wider community."
10906288,"Summary/Abstract, Core D: Behavioral Analysis and Modeling
This proposal’s overarching goal is to understand how internal states influence decisions and to identify the
underlying neural mechanisms. The Behavioral Analysis and Modeling Core’s development, testing, and
application of statistical tools to rigorously characterize behavioral states is critical to achieving this goal. This
collaboration will study behavioral state changes defined on three different time scales: those arising
spontaneously with engagement and disengagement in a task, those resulting from changing expectations
during the task, and those resulting from learning within and across days. The goals of this core are to develop
and extend novel open-source analytical tools for extracting state information from behavioral and video data
over these three timescales. First, the investigators will identify latent states governing choice behavior, which
vary across trials within an experimental session, using tools based on a hidden Markov model with generalized
linear model outputs. In addition, they will develop a hierarchical extension of the model to take statistical
advantage of the vast behavioral dataset produced by the proposed experimental projects. Next, they will infer
behavioral states that vary within a single trial using cutting-edge video analysis methods. In particular, they will
apply state-of-the-art markerless tracking methods to extract the position of animal features (paws, tongue, nose,
etc.) from behavioral video, and extend these methods to obtain estimates of animal pose in three dimensions
(fusing multiple camera views). They will then combine the markerless tracking output with nonlinear
autoencoder compression methods to obtain a more informative semi-supervised, low-dimensional data
representation of the video data. Using machine learning methods, they will temporally segment the resulting
representation to obtain interpretable behavioral states within each trial (e.g., “rest,” “groom,” “reach”), suitable
for further downstream analyses. Finally, they will develop new tools to track the dynamics of behavior over the
course of learning. Decision-making strategies evolve during training, both within and across sessions, and
continue to vary even in well-trained animals. To characterize these state changes, the investigators will develop
and apply novel statistical models that combine state-space modeling and reinforcement learning approaches to
analyze the learning curves observed in individual animals as they are trained to perform the International Brain
Laboratory decision-making task. The resulting framework will quantify how much of the pronounced differences
in learning curves across animals can be attributed to differences in identified learning rules, and will help identify
neural correlates of inferred learning dynamics in brainwide recordings. All software tools that are developed will
be fully open source and will be shared via a public, parallelized cloud implementation for maximal scalability
and reproducibility."
10906291,"Summary/Abstract, Project 1
Our responses to the world around us are controlled by diverse aspects of our complex internal states. For
example, we are more likely to take action when we are more vigilant and engaged, and we are more likely to
give particular interpretations to our percepts when we have prior expectations about our environment.
Understanding the neural basis of such internal state changes is important for unraveling the basic mechanisms
of flexible behavior in mammals and for understanding the etiology of disorders of state such as autism. Here
we propose to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying two types of internal state changes: spontaneous
fluctuations in engagement and goal-directed changes in perceptual bias. The team is part of the International
Brain Laboratory, an established consortium that has developed a standardized mouse decision-making task
and standardized methods for training, neural measurement, and data analysis, along with a working, scalable
infrastructure for sharing data. We will test the novel hypothesis that behavioral differences across these states
result from alterations in the structure of information flow between brain regions. Specifically, we hypothesize
that disengaging from a task dampens propagation of specific dimensions of population activity to downstream
structures, and that changing bias to favor one choice over another rotates the dimensions of information
propagation across the brain. To investigate these hypotheses, we will take advantage of our recent development
of technology for recording neural activity at large scale and of algorithms that quantify behavioral states and
multi-dimensional communication patterns between brain regions. We will first simultaneously record large,
dense populations of neurons from key sets of brain regions using Neuropixels 2.0 probes and systematically
characterize the dimensionality and magnitude of correlations between these regions. Then, we will quantify how
these correlation patterns depend on internal state, using novel algorithmic quantification of spontaneous state
transitions during the standardized and high-throughput behavioral task that has already been established by
the International Brain Laboratory. Finally, we will develop and apply a new class of analysis methods designed
to measure the interactions between three or more simultaneously recorded brain regions to identify whether
one region gates or modulates the multi-dimensional communication between the other regions, thus discovering
putative controller regions that direct the flow of information. This project will deliver the first systematic
characterization of multi-dimensional communication patterns across cortical and subcortical regions; tests of
new hypotheses about information routing in the brain; algorithms that quantify the relationships between large
populations of neurons; and a large-scale openly shared dataset of neural activity during flexible behavior across
the mouse brain."
10906297,"Summary/Abstract, Project 2
Even in the same environment, an animal may make different decisions on different occasions, because its

underlying neural mechanisms. The team is part of the International Brain Laboratory (IBL), an established

during the task with simultaneous recordings of neural populations and functional ultrasound. We will consider
two types of internal states: engaged/disengaged task performance and left/right biases due to the statistical
structure of the environment, which varies across blocks of trials. In Aim 1, we will examine the role of subcortical
structures in state-dependent decision-making with systematic optogenetic manipulations while well-trained mice
perform the IBL decision task. In Aim 2, we will examine the causal effects of inhibiting target regions and/or cell
types of interest on communication between other regions, using Neuropixels probes and functional ultrasound.
In Aim 3, to integrate our results, we will develop dynamical computational models of multi-region population
activity during our causal manipulations. These models will account for the effects of manipulation in one brain
region on behavior and activity in other regions, and their dependence on internal states. The results will help
interpret our experiments and refine them by suggesting other combinations of regions to record and manipulate.
Together, these experiments will integrate cutting-edge experimental and computational methods to characterize
the causal interactions of brainwide regions and their dependence on internal state."
10906303,"Summary/Abstract, Project 3
Even in the same environment, an animal may make different decisions on different occasions,
because its internal state, such as engagement in a task, interacts powerfully with external inputs
to determine behavior. This proposal’s overarching goal is to understand how internal states
influence decisions and to identify the underlying neural mechanisms. The team is part of the
International Brain Laboratory (IBL), an established consortium that has developed a
standardized mouse decision-making task and standardized methods for training, neural
measurement, and data analysis, along with a working, scalable infrastructure for sharing
data. The goal of Project 3 is to synthesize the findings of experimental Projects 1, 2, 4, and 5
into circuit-level mechanistic models of the IBL task. The task involves hierarchical, probabilistic
decision-making through sensory evidence integration to make left-right decisions about where
the stimulus is on the current trial, along with integration on a longer timescale to estimate the
slowly varying left-right biases in where the stimuli are more likely to appear. Initial models not
only will be trained to reproduce expert-level task performance, but also will include general
biological constraints on neural dynamics and anatomical connectivity gradients. They will be
analyzed for their learning dynamics, and for which parameters are the handles through which
internal states exert their effects on circuit computation and dynamics. These models will yield
predictions on multiple levels of abstraction: state-space predictions, network structure
predictions, and anatomical predictions. The resulting models will be deployed in a tight loop with
all experimental projects, to guide experimental design; serve as ground-truth testbeds for
perturbative and causal connectivity analysis studies; and link statistical analysis results from data
with mechanistic interpretations. The results of these experiment-model prediction comparisons
will then be used to further refine and elaborate the models. Project 3 researchers will incorporate
the experimentally derived neural activity data, causal connectivity by anatomical region data, and
structural cell-type and connectivity data to further constrain the models. Finally, Project 3 will
also generate highly simplified abstract neural circuit models, using novel methods of model
compression to elucidate the general principles underlying hierarchical decision-making in the
brain. All this work involves the use and de novo development of cutting-edge modeling,
statistical, and data analysis tools. The work of Project 3 will thus deliver a mechanistic circuit-
level understanding of this proposal’s overarching hypothesis that information flow and
communication across brain regions during decision-making depends on internal state."
10906307,"Summary/Abstract, Project 4
This proposal’s overarching goal is to understand how internal states influence decisions and to identify the
underlying neural mechanisms. The goal of this project is to conceptualize the change in internal state that
explains why experts respond differently from novices in the same situation. Although learning is well known to
produce long-lasting changes in diverse brain structures, many questions remain about the population-level
changes within single areas and the changes in communication among areas. This project will address these
questions by studying learning on two timescales: the long-term learning that defines animals’ gradual mastery
of a perceptual decision-making task, and the within-session learning that animals undergo when reward
statistics dynamically change. We will leverage a standardized behavioral task that has already been developed
by the International Brain Laboratory. In the task, animals judge the spatial location of a visual grating and report
it with a movement. First we will study behavior and neural activity as animals learn the basic version of this task
in which left and right choices are rewarded with equal probability. The interpretation of this data will be informed
by behavioral analyses from Core D that will characterize trial-by-trial engaged versus disengaged internal
states, a balance that will likely change over learning. We will also track behavioral changes over learning using
detailed video analysis. With these tools in hand, we will survey the cortex broadly using widefield imaging over
many training sessions as animals transition from novice to expert status. We will use this large dataset to identify
the areas that undergo the largest changes during learning and target them for simultaneous neural population
recordings using Neuropixels probes. These measurements will allow us to determine how communication
among areas changes in cortical and subcortical structures and how these changes parallel individual learning
rates. This analysis will follow a similar approach from Project 1: we will measure the magnitude and orientation
of a communication subspace that defines which single-trial fluctuations are communicated among areas. As we
change the stimulus statistics over uncued task blocks, we will also study within-session learning of experts.
Finally, we will use three mouse models of autism with distinct genetic and molecular anomalies that affect
behavioral flexibility and specifically the ability to adapt to blocks of trials in which left and right stimuli are
presented with unequal probability. We will establish which neural activity patterns are common among these
models and different from controls and thus identify the brain states that animals require to adjust their decision-
making priors as circumstances change. Taken together, these experiments will test the proposal’s overall
hypothesis, that each internal state change is associated with a specific pattern of neural activity and
communication within and across neural structures, on multiple timescales, from a few minutes to many weeks.
In this way, we expect to extract general principles for how internal states govern information flow through the
brain and, ultimately, decisions about what to do next."

Numerous studies now report associations between air pollution (AP) exposure and neurodevelopmental
disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and attention deficit disorder, all of which
share numerous features. My studies of early postnatal (human 3rd trimester brain equivalent) inhalation
exposures to concentrated ambient ultrafine (UFP, considered the most reactive component of AP) particles
(CAPS) in mice produced numerous neuropathological and behavioral features of these NDDs and of their
shared hypothesized mechanisms, including male bias, providing biological plausibility for the epidemiological
studies. Additionally, CAPS exposures markedly elevated brain levels of metals and trace elements, including
redox metals (Fe, Cu) as well as S, Ca, and Al, findings indicative of brain metal dyshomeostasis. This proposal
seeks to test the overarching hypothesis that AP-induced brain metal dyshomeostasis contributes to male-
biased NDD phenotypes via production of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress tested in a series of
questions designed to accelerate the understanding of mechanisms, and translational relevance of such effects
in 5 key integrated questions emanating from these novel, dramatic and unexpected findings: 1) Are toxic trace
element contaminants of UFPs a source of CAPS-induced NDD phenotypic features, specifically elevated brain
Fe and S (inhaled Fe nanoparticles and/or SO2) both of which are known neurotoxicants via ferroptotic and
oxidative stress mechanisms? 2) What accounts for male bias in UFP-induced neurotoxicity? Does it reflect an
earlier colonization of male brain by activated microglia and their interactions with Fe uptake? 3) What are the
portals of entry of UFPs into brain? We utilize the precocial African spiny mouse with its extended gestational
period relative to the altricial C57 mouse in which 3rd trimester occurs postnatally and can include nasal and
olfactory uptake to determine whether the African spiny mouse might serve as a more relevant human model. 4)
How does nanoparticle processing in brain subsequently influence/modulate toxicity and does it generate toxic
or protective mechanisms e.g., alterations in the ferritin cage? 5) Does post-mortem brain tissue from humans
that had been diagnosed with NDDs (Neurobiobank) contain exogenous metal nanoparticles as we see, e.g.,
with Fe located within damaged myelin in corpus callosum after CAPS? These integrated efforts will begin to
elaborate mechanisms of AP-induced NDDs and associated sex differences, to define the most relevant mouse
model, and to determine the need to regulate air metal levels for public health protection."

 The outcome of Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1) disease depends heavily on whether neuronal
replication phenotypes trend towards a productive or silent infection. However, the variables which govern
these heterologous infection phenotypes are not fully understood. Identification of factors which influence the
outcome of neuronal replication is essential to develop new treatments for severe disease and alleviate the
global burden of HSV-1.
 A major limitation to the study of heterologous infection phenotypes is that they are quickly lost in traditional
culture models, typically being overwhelmed by secondary viral spread from productively infected cells. Our
solution to this problem is to incorporate drop-based microfluidic technology that allows detection of diverse
viral replication outcomes with single-cell resolution. We have developed a method to grow and infect primary
neurons using a micron-scale, hydrogel bead (microgel), that permits single-cell experimentation within an
isolated environment. Our proposal aims to investigate the conditions and factors that give rise to heterologous
outcomes of neuronal HSV-1 infection with the ultimate goal of better understanding the determinants of HSV-1
disease.
 This proposal will combine the development and characterization of in-drop neuronal infection to address
critical questions about HSV-1 infection and disease. The first aim will focus on classifying the outcomes of
viral replication in different neuron types. The second will use single-cell transcriptional profiling of infected
neurons to identify transcripts that promote productive or silent HSV-1 infection. Specific Aim 1 focuses on
quantifying heterologous phenotypes of HSV-1 infection in neurons. We will utilize drop-based microfluidic
separation and analysis of HSV-1 infected neurons. Outcomes of viral infection will be measured by HSV-1-
expressed fluorescent proteins and in-drop PCR detection of viral genomes. We expect that the extent of viral
replication reflects the capacity for different cellular environments to support HSV-1 infection. Specific Aim
2 focuses on single cell transcriptional profiling of productive or silent HSV-1 replication in neurons. We will
implement in-drop single-cell RNA-sequencing to profile viral and cellular transcripts from infected neurons.
Clustering analysis and classification of single cell transcriptomes will be based on the detection of viral RNAs.
The presence of individual transcripts will reflect the extent of viral replication occurring in each cell. Following
classification, correlation analysis will identify cellular transcripts that are increased or decreased with each
infection state. Together, these experiments will identify and quantify the range of outcomes for HSV-1 infection
of neurons. Subsequently, we will discover cellular genes that promote or inhibit productive viral replication by
identifying determinants of certain heterologous phenotypes. Exploring neuronal infections at the single-cell
level will provide unprecedented insight into HSV-1 replication and disease."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease resulting in pancreatic b-cell destruction. Islet-infiltrating
leukocytes will generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, and T cell
effector molecules involved in b-cell lysis. Islet transplantation is a promising treatment for T1D, but numerous
hurdles including immune-mediated rejection, adverse effects of immunosuppression on islet function, ideal
sites for transplantation, and declining allograft survival impede human translatability. Islet encapsulation may
provide immunoprotection to preserve islet function and prevent immune responses against the islet graft
following transplantation. The goal of this project is to assess the efficacy of a pre-vascularized subcutaneous
device-less (DL) site for transplantation and to enhance a novel cytoprotective coating for islet encapsulation
consisting of a layer-by-layer hydrogen-bonded assembly of tannic acid (TA), an immunomodulatory
antioxidant, poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVPON), a cytocompatible natural and synthetic polymer, and CTLA-4-Ig
to inhibit T cell activation in mouse models and humanized mouse models of islet allotransplantation.
Transplantation of (PVPON/TA/CTLA-4-Ig)-encapsulated islets in the DL site are functional, does not elicit a
foreign body reaction unlike the microencapsulated devices currently being evaluated in clinical trials, can
decrease proinflammatory immune responses, and delay allograft rejection in the absence of global
immunosuppression. Our overarching hypothesis is that (PVPON/TA/CTLA-4-Ig) encapsulation of islets
can elicit localized immunosuppression and preserve islet function following transplantation into a
pre-vascularized device-less site without stimulated deleterious fibrosis. To address this hypothesis, the
following independent and interrelated aims will be defined in mouse and human samples. (1) Determine if
(PVPON/TA/CTLA-4-Ig) encapsulation can suppress proinflammatory innate and adaptive immune responses
after transplantation. (2) Determine if (PVPON/TA/CTLA-4-Ig) encapsulation stabilizes b-cell function and
decreases inflammation. The insights gained from our studies will identify additional pathways that can be
exploited to conjugate novel inhibitors of proinflammatory immune responses to our adaptable
(PVPON/TA/CTLA-4-Ig) coatings to further delay islet allograft rejection for future human translational studies."

 Sickle-cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder that causes considerable
morbidity and mortality, affecting an estimated 100,000 individuals in the US, and millions more
worldwide. Multiple editing-based cures for SCD are currently in clinical development, however,
there are no clinical-grade laboratory tests available capable of characterizing the biophysical
and rheological properties of RBCs derived from genome-edited SCD HSPCs. Assays capable
of characterizing RBC quality are urgently needed to assess the potency of emerging
editing-based genomic therapies for SCD, regardless of the editing modality.
 One of the central challenges that has impeded the development of a highly performant
potency assay for evaluating the functional efficacy of editing-based genomic therapies for SCD
has been the lack of laboratory technologies capable of sensitively, accurately, and precisely
capturing the biophysical properties of SCD-RBCs utilizing only a small number of cells. In
recent years, several innovations have emerged that now make the development and analytical
validation of a potency assay for editing-based SCD genomic therapies feasible. One of these
has been the advent of microfluidics-based diagnostic devices capable of functionally
characterizing the health of RBCs at unprecedented levels of resolution and sensitivity.
 This proposal seeks to leverage (1) an existing suite of these aforementioned
next-generation RBC biophysical and functional characterization devices, (2) conventional
hematologic assays, and (3) a well-established machine learning approach to develop and
analytically validate a first-in-kind potency assay for editing-based therapies for SCD. To
achieve this, we will first construct a panel of comprehensively profiled, gold-standard reference
samples of HSPCs that simulate a representative range of genome editing outcomes in SCD
and prepare data for machine learning training. A machine learning model will then be trained to
predict the percentage of RBCs that functionally exhibit a non-SCD phenotype. Once trained,
we will validate the performance of the new potency assay, a panel of HSPCs affected by SCD
will be therapeutically edited using at least three different modalities (e.g. homology-directed
repair, base-editing, etc.)."

”Engineering has a persistent diversity challenge,” states a recent National Academies report. The most
impactful science comes from diverse teams working together, and diversity in the STEM workplace improves
work engagement and performance, enhances the quality of research and provision of health care, and
promotes innovation. The current homogeneity in engineering, both regionally at Clarkson University (CU) and
nationally, motivates the BiOengineering Research Education to AcceLerate Innovation in STEM (BOREALIS)
Scholars program, and inspires Clarkson’s equity-minded approach to better engage sociodemographically
diverse regional students. To address these opportunities, BOREALIS is designed to recruit and enroll three
cohorts of five sociodemographically diverse students (including Black and Indigenous People of Color and
students with disabilities) especially from the rural, economically depressed North Country region of New York
State, and educate, encourage, and support them to enter the bioengineering workforce via pursuit of graduate
study in bioengineering. Students from the North Country often face challenges entering STEM fields and
building scientific identities, such as scant academic preparation, an unwelcoming atmosphere from faculty,
and navigating intersectionality of identities. Through a series of integrated and complementary educational
experiences—(1) a summer bridge program; (2) first- and second- academic year activities; and (3) summer
research experiences—combined with evidence-based mentor and mentee training, CU will foster BOREALIS
Scholars’ successful transition into and completion of the Honors Program, positioning them to pursue
graduate school in bioengineering or a related field. This new pathway leverages existing resources for student
success. The research education plan includes new initiatives for student success during the first
undergraduate years, and faculty training in and use of inclusive pedagogy and effective mentoring. The
BOREALIS Scholars program at CU represents one small step towards maintaining America’s scientific
leadership by investing in sociodemographically diverse students from the North Country. By the conclusion of
the project, we will have: (1) created an evidence-based mentored portal and pathway for research-curious
students to explore biomedical engineering early in their undergraduate career and (2) built and sustained
cohorts of sociodemographically diverse students from rural backgrounds engaged in biomedical science and
engineering research, leading to (3) an increase in the number of rural, diverse students pursuing
bioengineering graduate study. These three aims will enable our goal of increasing the number of rural, diverse
students pursuing bioengineering graduate school after CU."
10888998,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over the last five years, three cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) have been approved for the
treatment of metastatic breast cancer. CDK4/6i prevent cancer cells from dividing by blocking their progression
through the G1/G0 phase of the cell cycle. However, results from in vitro studies reveal that both exogenous and
endogenous CDK4/6i increase the invasiveness of certain forms of cancer. The consequences of G1/G0 cell
cycle arrest on cancer cell behavior in vivo remain unknown. Caenorhabditis elegans anchor cell (AC) invasion
provides an excellent yet simple in vivo model of cell invasive behavior that allows single-cell and subcellular
analysis of cell invasion through basement membrane. Our lab determined that G1/G0-specific arrest is required
for AC invasion to occur and that the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-67/TLX acts as a key regulator of this
process. In the absence of NHR-67, the AC becomes non-invasive but over-proliferates, indicating that
proliferation can increase as invasion is blocked. The long-term goal is to understand both the molecular
mechanisms controlling G1/G0 cell cycle arrest and the in vivo effects of CDK4/6i as individual agents and in
combination with inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORi). Together, CDK4/6i and mTORi have
been shown to induce senescence in cancer cells in vitro, suggesting that combining these pharmacological
agents might be useful in the clinical setting. The overall objectives of this fellowship application are to (i)
elucidate how G1/G0 is maintained in the C. elegans AC and (ii) determine whether ACs in NHR-67-deficient
animals can be pharmacologically induced to transition from proliferation-to-invasion-to-senescence. Based on
preliminary data and prior research, the central hypothesis is that redundant mechanisms regulate the G1/G0
state of the wild-type AC and that proliferative ACs in NHR-67-deficient animals can be prompted to undergo
senescence. This central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specifics aims. Aim 1 will identify the
components regulating G1/G0 arrest in the pro-invasive AC. Aim 2 will evaluate the transition between AC
proliferation, invasion and senescence upon depletion of CDK4/6, mTOR, or both. To address these aims, this
project will use established gene knockdown techniques, high-resolution imaging, and cutting-edge
technologies, including a novel live cell cycle state sensor and two conditional protein depletion systems. The
results of these studies can help guide the development of future treatment strategies for aggressive cancers."
10830411,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Memory loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) reflects a progressive failure of neural network function in the setting
of pathology and neuroinflammation. The overall goal of this proposal is to explore a novel paradigm for the
role of the REST transcription factor in the modulation of neural networks and microglial function in AD, and to
advance a new therapeutic approach. We discovered that the master developmental regulator REST/NRSF is
induced in the aging human brain and coordinates the expression of a gene network that protects aging
neurons from neurotoxic stress and hyperexcitation. REST is downregulated in AD, beginning at the stage of
mild cognitive impairment. Our preliminary studies in conditional REST-deficient mice indicate that REST
protects against amyloid and tau pathology, as well as cognitive decline in AD mouse models. To begin to
understand the role of REST in critical neural circuits, we will generate highly selective knockouts of REST in
layer II entorhinal cortical neurons, or in CA1 or CA3 hippocampal neurons, components of the entorhinal
cortex (EC)-hippocampal circuit that is affected early in AD. These novel REST knockout mice will be crossed
with established AD transgenic lines to explore effects on neural network excitation, synaptic plasticity,
memory and pathology. We will also extend recent preliminary studies showing that REST is lost in microglia in
AD, and that REST-deficient microglia are functionally impaired. To explore the role of REST in microglia, we
have generated a conditional microglial REST-knockout mouse line. This mouse model, together with primary
microglial cell cultures, will be used to investigate REST-regulated immune/inflammatory signaling pathways,
as well as effects on phagocytosis and Aβ clearance. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis will be performed to
broadly define REST-regulated gene networks and signaling pathways that affect microglial function. A central
question is whether REST is a druggable target. We have identified novel REST-activating drugs that prevent
memory loss and pathology in AD mouse models. Drug activity is lost in REST-deficient mice, indicating
specificity for REST. Importantly, the prototype REST-activating drug does not show evidence of toxicity in
mice following chronic administration for more than two years. These novel agents not only provide proof-of-
principle for translation, but are also valuable tools for discovering underlying mechanisms of REST-mediated
neuroprotection. One such mechanism is the unfolded protein response, which may be modulated by REST
activation through target genes and signaling pathways that will be investigated. This multidisciplinary
approach may provide novel insights into neuroprotective mechanisms in aging and AD, with potentially
important therapeutic implications."
10670552,"The majority of patients afflicted with a T-cell lymphoma (TCL) will experience disease progression and ultimately
succumb to their disease, as current therapies are rarely curative, and the underlying mechanisms driving TCL
progression and chemotherapy resistance are poorly understood. We have demonstrated that antigen-
presenting cells, particularly lymphoma-associated macrophages (LAM) are abundant constituents of the tumor
microenvironment (TME) in TCL, and directly promote the growth and survival of primary TCL cells ex vivo.
Blockade of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), required for antigen presentation and T-cell activation,
inhibits LAM-induced proliferation of malignant T cells. Conversely, direct stimulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR)
on primary TCL cells culminates in the activation and upregulation of transcription factors that promote the growth
and survival of conventional T cells, including the zinc-finger transcription factor GATA-3. We have recently
shown that GATA-3 identifies a molecularly and clinically distinct subset of TCL that are highly resistant to
chemotherapy. Genetic and pharmacologic loss-of-function (and gain-of-function) strategies further
demonstrated that GATA-3 confers resistance to chemotherapy. Collectively, our preliminary data are consistent
with the hypothesis that TCR signaling and GATA-3-dependent gene expression are exploited by malignant T
cells and promote chemotherapy resistance. A paucity of TCL models amenable to genetic manipulation and
pharmacologic in vivo studies has hampered further progress. Therefore, the extent to which antigenic
stimulation and GATA-3-dependent gene expression promote T-cell lymphomagenesis and chemotherapy
resistance within the native tumor microenvironment, and within the context of a genetic landscape resembling
human TCL, remains uncertain. We have identified novel, and clinically achievable, therapeutic strategies
targeting the TCR, and we aim to extend those earlier findings here using primary TCL cells and patient-derived
xenografts (PDX). Our long-term goals are to understand the role of antigen-presenting cells, and other
constituents of the TME, in promoting T-cell lymphomagenesis; to identify the lymphomagenic factors they
provide, including those that are antigen, costimulatory, and cytokine receptor dependent; and to develop novel
therapeutic strategies exploiting these vulnerabilities that will improve outcomes for patients afflicted with these
NHL. Our overall objective here is to determine the mechanisms by which the TCR and GATA-3 promote T-cell
lymphomagenesis in vivo. This will be achieved by addressing our central hypothesis that TCL progression,
including resistance to chemotherapy, is regulated by TCR- and GATA-3-dependent transcriptional programs.
This hypothesis is well grounded in our own preliminary data, and is entirely consistent with our current
understanding of the genetic landscape and molecular pathogenesis of the TCL. We anticipate that the research
proposed will provide a strong scientific rationale for novel therapeutic strategies that will ultimately be tested in
well-designed clinical trials."

The goal of this proposal is to implement a novel Research Training in Sensorimotor Neurorehabilitation
program to prepare the next generation of scientists that can address the growing need for neuroscience-

movement and rehabilitation scientists (MRS) through the Northwestern University Interdepartmental
Neuroscience Program (NUIN) PhD program since 2009, with demonstrated success reflected in more than
20 graduates currently leading successful research careers in academia and industry. The proposed program
is built on this research and training record with the mission to train students with clinical and life/applied
science backgrounds and post-doctoral fellows with clinical backgrounds to become rehabilitation scientists in
basic, translational or clinical research. These scientists will have the ability to integrate knowledge from the
various disciplines involved in sensorimotor neurorehabilitation, including neuroscience, engineering and
clinical sciences. The training program will focus on four training goals: 1) to provide a thorough grounding in
the basic neurobiology of sensorimotor function and control, including translation of insights between animal
and human research models; 2) to learn fundamental engineering experimental methods for measurement
and analysis of neuronal and musculoskeletal sensory and motor function; 3) to facilitate knowledge sharing
in the clinical management of individuals with movement disorders between the post-doctoral and pre-doctoral
trainees; and 4) to provide professional development training to support future rehabilitation research career
success. The unique structure of the program, couples training of post-doctoral trainees with clinical expertise
with pre-doctoral trainees focusing on neuroscience. The program is the first of its kind to provide post-doctoral
research training of Doctors of Physical Therapy (DPT), an untapped cohort of prospective scientists that has
emerged in the contemporary age of science-based medicine and evidence-based practice. These DPT
candidates for post-doctoral slots will be drawn from research intensive Physical Therapy Programs across
the United States. Pre-doctoral trainees will be drawn from the NUIN-MRS program. The translational
interdisciplinary nature of the program will allow close interaction between clinical investigators and basic and
applied sciences investigators, providing a unique opportunity for training in translational research. We intend
to support a total of 12 pre-doctoral trainees and 5 post-doctoral trainees with NIH funding for up to two years
each. Additional institutional support is available in the form of tuition and stipend supplements for trainees and
diversity fellowships to support diversity recruiting efforts."
10913532,"We propose to map focal motor to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FMBSs), which are the most
dangerous epileptic seizures. These seizures increase the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy
(SUDEP) and lead to fractures and dislocations due to violent falls. SUDEP is the most common cause of
death in patients with epilepsy. We propose that the canonical circuit published in Kandel's Principles of Neural
Science (2013), which posits that focal seizures engage diencephalic thalamocortical circuits, which leads to
secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures is too simplistic. It is not consistent with known neuroanatomy of
the motor cortex, and modulation of seizures by subcortical structures. We propose that FMBSs originating in
the frontal cortex spread through the striatum to the globus pallidus, substantia nigra and thalamus via the
indirect pathway, in addition to spreading directly to the thalamus .. We test this hypothesis in three aims. Aim
1: to map FMBS spread at the mesoscale and compare it to anatomical connections of the seizure focus in
TRAP mice using tissue clearing and 3D imaging combined with tract tracing and electrophysiological
techniques). Aim 2 to map FMBS spread at the microscopic scale through the cortex and direct and indirect
basal ganglia circuits in TRAP mice using immunohistochemistry. In aim 3, we will study dopamine type 2
receptor modulation of seizures at the mesoscale and microcircuit levels using a combination of techniques.
We incorporated tools and techniques developed by the BRAIN initiative in our laboratory to move
seizure circuit mapping research forward. We have used TRAP mice, the CLARITY technique, high resolution,
high-throughput imaging, and 3D reconstruction of images to visualize activated neuronal pathways. We have
constructed a highly collaborative team with expertise in anatomy, electrophysiology and computer science of
imaging, which allows us to generate and analyze large volumes of data and build on each other's creativity.
We have acquired sufficient equipment to perform these studies. These studies will generate new targets for
the modulation of seizures by deep brain stimulation. Currently, this method is used for anterior thalamic
stimulation and responsive neurostimulation, but in the future, multiple subcortical structures could sites for
neuromodulation. Receptors and ion channels known to modulate basal ganglia circuits may emerge as novel
targets for anticonvulsant development. If our studies confirm seizure passage through the striatum, then ii
would be important to understand the underlying cellular mechanisms."
10891608,"The long-term goal of the proposed work is to determine mechanisms that control gene regulatory networks
to generate a normal endowment of mature nephrons. Formation of the proper complement of nephrons
requires a balance between self-renewal and differentiation of progenitor cells. Disruption of this balance leads
to renal hypoplasia and chronic kidney disease. Soon after progenitor cells begin to differentiate, chromatin
must undergo significant changes to set up gene expression patterns for formation of distinct cell types along
the nephron. Defects in formation of specific renal epithelial cell types leads to glomerular disease and an
inability of tubules to perform normal physiological functions, such as maintaining salt and water balance.
 A major mechanism by which cells respond to signals to direct gene expression to a particular fate or
lineage is through the concerted action of chromatin remodeling complexes and tissue restricted transcription
factors. These proteins act on regulatory regions in the genome to establish control of gene expression at the
correct time and place. While individual factors that control gene expression in nephron progenitor cells have
been defined, how these proteins cooperate to control gene expression in the developing kidney has not been
explored. The identification and characterization of the regulatory elements where these factors act is also a
major challenge in the field.
 We discovered that Sall1 plays a pivotal role in these developmental decisions by interacting with two
distinct chromatin remodeling complexes, the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex and
the Switch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex. We propose that the integrated actions of Sall1,
Six2, NuRD and SWI/SNF controls nephron progenitor cell gene expression to attain a dynamic balance
between self-renewal and differentiation, and establishes the epigenetic modifications required for formation of
specific cell lineages in the mature kidney. This novel paradigm will be tested in three Aims. In Aim 1, we will
perform Hi-ChIP to identify enhancer-promoter contacts in uncommitted and induced progenitors, and define
changes in mutant cells. Aim 2 will determine how genomic binding of Sall1, Six2, NuRD and SWI/SNF are
affected in mutant nephron progenitor cells. Epigenomic editing will be used to demonstrate causal
relationships between gene expression and binding of these factors at regulatory regions. In order to translate
our findings to human development and disease, in Aim 3 we will test our findings in the mouse from Aims 1
and 2 in human iPS cell-derived nephron progenitor cells.
 These studies will illuminate mechanisms that underlie human genetic syndromes and sporadic birth
defects, such as renal hypoplasia, which commonly cause childhood kidney failure. Our findings will also
provide insight into how to reprogram kidney cells from a differentiated state back to a progenitor state, to
promote regeneration of mature tubular epithelial cells in order to correct nephron deficits."

The purpose of this International Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide the candidate with
the training and expertise needed to transition into an independent global health researcher with expertise in the
science of violence- and health-related intervention in informal settlements. Globally, 30% of women have
experienced intimate partner violence (IPV). Prevention and response to IPV is critical; yet few interventions
have been adapted for residents of informal settlements. Currently, 56% of the 3 million residents in Nairobi, the
capital city of Kenya, live in informal settlements, and this population is likely to double by 2050. Research carried
out in 2012 in Kibera, the largest informal settlement in Nairobi, reported that 85% of women have experienced
IPV in their lifetime and a 2018 study reported that 66% of women in similar Nairobi settlements experienced
IPV in the past year. Women experiencing IPV are more likely to also experience depression, anxiety, and post-
traumatic stress. In 2014, Kenya identified reduction of and response to violence against women (VAW) as a
priority health area in national policies and strategic plans; yet, no screening or response protocols have been
adopted in clinics in informal settlements for IPV survivors. The aims of this study are, therefore, to: 1) identify
potential facilitators and barriers to screening and intervention for IPV and related mental health challenges in
healthcare settings in informal settlements in Kenya; 2) combine an IPV (WINGS) and mental health (PM+)
response intervention and adapt the combined (WINGS+PM+) intervention for use in existent healthcare settings
in informal settlements in Nairobi; and 3) pilot test the adapted WINGS+PM+ intervention through a randomized
control trial with 130 women to assess the safety, feasibility, and acceptability of WINGS+PM+ versus PM+-only
as the foundation for a low-cost IPV services package that can expand services to women experiencing IPV in
informal settlements. The proposed career development plan has been designed to augment the applicant's
experience researching VAW and women's health in informal settlements in Kenya and enable her to: 1) gain
research skills in the design and adaptation of violence- and health-related interventions, with an emphasis on
low-cost interventions that can be carried out by lay community members in healthcare settings in informal
settlements; 2) obtain methodological expertise in the design, adaptation, delivery, and assessment of feasibility
and acceptability of interventions; 3) cultivate important relationships with global health experts, intervention
scientists, and healthcare providers in informal settlements in Kenya and East Africa, and 4) increase her
professional skills for a successful independent global health research career, including grantsmanship,
manuscript writing, and collaborative interdisciplinary and international research. The training goals will be
achieved through didactic courses, specialized workshops and seminars, hands-on research, and mentoring
from an interdisciplinary team of experts in both the U.S. and Kenya. The research findings and methodological
skills to be gained from this IRSDA (K01) have important applicability for health research in Kenya."

This project investigates behavioral and neural heterogeneity in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major
depressive disorder (MDD) using hypothesis- and data-driven approaches. OCD and MDD are major sources of
disability worldwide, with fewer than half of patients responding adequately to first-line treatments. Treatment
may be impeded by the fact that OCD and MDD are both highly heterogeneous, with clusters of symptoms likely
derived from differing psychological and neurobiological etiologies. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)
framework seeks to address this problem in part by investigating dimensional components of behavior that span
across disorders and more closely align with brain circuitry than does the multifaceted diagnostic phenotype. In
the present project, we follow an RDoC approach to the study of heterogeneity by investigating relationships
between behavior, clinical symptoms, and brain function using task-based and resting-state fMRI in a sample of
75 OCD patients and 75 MDD patients. Our preliminary data in OCD patients and individuals with depressive
symptoms point to interoceptive sensitivity (IS) and perseverative negative thinking (PT) as dimensional
components of behavior that are not only transdiagnostic but also explain important within-disorder
heterogeneity; the first aim of this proposal builds on these findings by investigating associations of IS and PT
with clinical symptoms, behavior, and brain function in OCD and MDD. Complementing this hypothesis-driven
approach, the second aim of the project is a data-driven investigation using unsupervised machine learning (ML)
to uncover neurobiological profiles that characterize variability in brain function across OCD and MDD. Building
on our preliminary analysis identifying three subgroups within OCD distinguished by differential patterns of
resting-state functional connectivity, we will investigate neurobiological heterogeneity across OCD and MDD and
link clinical and behavioral data to neurobiological subgroups using a comprehensive ‘deep phenotyping’
approach to data acquisition and analysis. The overarching goals of both aims are to identify factors contributing
to heterogeneity that can be developed as novel targets for personalized treatments based on an individual
patient’s neurobehavioral profile."

Speech recognition difficulties are common for older adults and those with age-related hearing loss (ARHL),
particularly in complex environments. Maladaptive hyperexcitability in the central auditory system, a form of
central gain, is known to occur with age and hearing loss and may contribute to altered temporal processing
and subsequent speech-in-noise (SIN) deficits. Studies of central gain in humans often focus on cortical
hyperactivity, yet research suggests that subcortical hyperactivity, notably exaggerated encoding of sound
onsets and low-frequency amplitude modulation envelopes (like those common in speech), may be present in
the auditory midbrain of older and hearing-impaired adults and exert a larger influence on SIN difficulties than
previously thought. However, we currently lack a clear understanding of the contexts in which subcortical
hyperactivity exists in age and ARHL and how it relates to behavior. This complicates long-term efforts to
develop pharmaceutical and behavioral interventions to ameliorate SIN deficits. The overarching goal of the
proposed research is to characterize how hypersensitivities to stimulus onsets and modulation envelopes
localized to the auditory midbrain are (1) more prevalent for older than younger adults, (2) related to inferior
colliculus structure, (3) predicted by hearing loss in older adults (independently of age), and (4) associated with
SIN deficits. Experiments use an innovative combination of electrophysiology, structural neuroimaging, and
source localization to characterize neural responses arising from subcortical generator sites (e.g. inferior
colliculus) in both quiet and noise. To quantify hyperresponsivities in the midbrain relative to the periphery,
inferior colliculus responses are normalized auditory nerve responses. Aim 1 examines whether hyperactivity is
more prevalent in older adults relative to younger adults, whether diminished cochlear compression associated
with ARHL leads to enhanced envelope encoding in quiet, and assesses how midbrain microstructural
characteristics that have been associated with GABAergic changes (e.g. longitudinal relaxation time, R1) relate
to hypersensitivity and potentially mediate age effects. Aim 2 examines how midbrain hypersensitivity predicts
behavior, testing the hypothesis that greater hypersensitivity benefits perception in quiet (e.g., better amplitude
modulation (AM) discrimination in quiet) but not perception in noise (e.g., poorer performance on SIN tests,
poorer AM discrimination in noise). Results can advance our understanding of the contexts in which envelope
and sound onset hyperresponsivities are present in the subcortical auditory system, how best to quantify it, and
whether it alternately benefits or impedes perception. Findings will inform future studies of subcortical neural
hyperactivity and not only improve our understanding of SIN difficulties of older adults, but also determine the
extent to which clinical interventions need to consider declines in subcortical structure and function. With the
aging (and hearing-impaired) population growing yearly, this research has high"

Although genomics has led to an expansive set of predicted genes, functional annotation of gene products
remains rate-limiting. To drive discovery of gene functions, we exploit host-virus interfaces and signatures of
conflict. In addition to revealing host defense mechanisms, studies of infected cells and immune responses have
led to the definition of fundamental cellular processes and key master regulators (e.g. SRC, P53). Here, we
leverage our integrative framework – termed VIROLOG - for the discovery and characterization of novel host-
virus interfaces. Specifically, we use genomic scars of conflict unique to factors linked to infection outcomes to
identify uncharacterized genes combined with cell-based and viral infection assays. The merit of our strategy is
illustrated by the identification of a vertebrate specific MItochondrial STress Response (MISTR) circuit. MISTR
is executed by related electron transport chain factors and regulated by ultraconserved miRNAs induced by
stress signals such as infection and hypoxia. Using the VIROLOG framework, this research program is defining
new battlefronts in mitochondria highlighted by hundreds of viral-encoded factors that may target this organelle
during infection to drive viral replication. As our multidimensional bioinformatic screens serve as fertile ground to
identify host defenses and uncover new dimensions to textbook functions, we are developing VIROLOG as an
interactive user database and interface. Using “classic” viruses such as vaccinia, the prototypical poxvirus, and
virus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a model RNA virus, along with the extensive molecular toolkit for key host
defenses, we will narrow the gap of genes lacking function. Collectively, our innovative framework continues the
rich history of using viral systems to drive biological discovery by exploiting a combination of classic evolutionary
and molecular signatures paired with experimental analysis to characterize mechanisms.

10875401,"While new classes of drugs and advances in surgical interventions has led to a decline in the cardiovascular
mortality rate, the incidence of cardiovascular disease has begun to rise again in recent years after decades of
decline, suggesting a continued investment in biomedical research will be critical to maintaining the progress we
have made in fighting this disease. Due to the complexity of cardiovascular disease and the growing availability
of advanced research techniques to understand these disease processes, it is imperative that the next
generation of research scientists receive training across a variety of disciplines, including cardiovascular
physiology, cellular and molecular biology, and disease pathogenesis. The NIH-funded Cardiovascular
Undergraduate Research Initiative fOr Underrepresented Students (CURIOUS) program was established in
2019 to enhance the access of minority and disadvantaged undergraduate students to advanced research
training in cardiovascular disease and to increase the recruitment of underrepresented students into our graduate
programs. However, the state of Louisiana currently lacks any NHLBI funded T32 programs to further graduate
training.
The Center for Cardiovascular Diseases and Sciences (CCDS) at LSU Health Shreveport includes a
collaborative, multi-departmental faculty with research interests across a wide variety of cardiovascular disease.
To facilitate graduate and postdoctoral training, the CCDS has funded 26 Predoctoral Fellows and 34
Postdoctoral Fellows over the past 8 years. The goal of the Multidisciplinary Training in Cardiovascular
Pathophysiology (MCTP) Training Program is to grow and formalize our graduate research program, to meet the
need for advanced interdisciplinary training for Predoctoral Fellows, and to provide a diverse pool of scientists
to the study of cardiovascular disease. Trainees within the MCTP will be exposed to inter-departmental training
initiatives, providing an extensive training experience that complements the individual departmental programs.
The MTCP training program will build on current training initiatives in the CCDS to provide the only cardiovascular
training program in Louisiana and the only training program in the state focused on disease pathogenesis. The
overall goals of the MTCP at LSU Health Shreveport are: 1) to provide opportunities for research training in state-
of-the-art research laboratories involving collaborative groups of established and emerging research scientists,
2) to establish a training program in cardiovascular pathophysiology involving didactic lectures, seminars and
interaction with world-renowned scientists, clinical research experiences, and multiple annual research events,
3) to further enhance the recruitment of underrepresented groups of scientists into cardiovascular research in
collaboration with the NIH-funded CURIOUS program, and 4) to enhance the professional development of our
trainees through access to advanced training for grant writing, and career skills seminars."
10815561,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The outcomes of advanced solid cancer patients remain poor, particularly among minorities. Although patient-
and system-level factors are important contributors to cancer disparities, physician-related factors such as
implicit bias also play a significant role. While rare cases of explicit discrimination may occur, the presence of
implicit bias among physicians is considered to be mainly unintentional, occurring at an unconscious level.
Implicit bias refers to an individual’s utilization of unconscious beliefs when making judgments about people
from different groups (e.g., racial/ethnic groups). Effective patient-physician communication is essential to
providing optimal patient care and is directly linked to outcomes. Research demonstrates that physicians
inadequately communicate with minority patients but the role of implicit bias, a potentially modifiable factor,
has not been evaluated. This study would collect one of the largest datasets of conversations between
oncologists and their Black and Hispanic patients to date and would serve as the foundation for an intervention
for oncologists and cancer patients. A more in-depth knowledge of the reasons underlying these disparities
in care will be an important step toward improving the outcomes of >65,000 minority patients diagnosed with
advanced cancer each year. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Evaluate whether oncologists’ implicit bias explains
racial/ethnic disparities in patient-centered communication during discussions about cancer management
among advanced solid cancer patients; 2) Examine the role of oncologists’ implicit bias in explaining racial
and ethnic differences in psychologic distress, satisfaction with communication and treatment related
decisional conflict advanced solid cancer patients; 3) Assess if implicit bias explains racial/ethnic disparities
in oncologists’ assessment of pain, use of guideline-concordant pain management and pain control among
patients with advanced solid cancer. We propose to study 60 oncologists and 360 of their English-speaking
patients with advanced solid cancer. Recruitment will occur in the racially diverse MSHS in East Harlem, NY
and DUHS in Durham, NC. We will use the Implicit Association Test, a validated measure of implicit bias, to
assess oncologists. We will audio record clinical encounters of oncologists with 6 of their patients undergoing
imaging assessment following initiation of first- or second-line chemotherapy to identify differences in patient-
centered communication in discussions about cancer management. Pre-visit, immediate post-visit and follow-
up surveys, 3- and 6-months later will assess their level of pain control, psychologic distress, satisfaction with
communication and treatment related decisional conflict. We will also collect data on physician’s pain
assessment and use of guideline-concordant pain management. Our study is significant because findings will
deepen our understanding of relationships between implicit bias, communication processes, management,
and patient outcomes. The knowledge generated by our project could inform both physician-level educational
programs and patient-specific interventions."

The ultimate goal of this proposal is to understand the molecular and cellular substrates of early tau
pathology, in order to create the foundation for future therapeutic targets for Alzheimer’s Disease
(AD) and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD). Tau is a protein, expressed in neurons and
oligodendroglial cells, whose aggregation is a pathological hallmark of a wide range of neurodegenerative
diseases, including Fronto-Temporal-Dementia (FTD). Mounting evidence shows that the pathogenic
process begins long before the detection of neuronal aggregates, with the detection of white matter changes
in subjects with mild cognitive impairment, although the underlying pathogenic processes responsible for
these changes remain only partially understood. This proposal will directly address this major gap of
knowledge in the field, and tackle the major research priority of the 2019 NIH ADRD Summit, to
investigate the early events of the disease.
We leverage the expertise of the PI in biochemistry and phase separation and that of the co-I in myelin
biology, to test the hypothesis that the white matter changes detected at the early stages of ADRD are
mediated by misregulation of the condensed state of tau in oligodendrocytes. This hypothesis is
motivated by the evidence that: 1) tau can self-assemble into a novel phase-separated condensed state
(“condensate”); 2) tau mutations specific for FTD specifically impact tau condensates and 3) that
oligodendroglial lineage cells, the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system, are specific sites of
tau-mediated dysfunction at the early stages of the neurodegenerative process. Extensive evidence in human
subjects and animal models of FTD identify myelin damage and oligodendroglial dysfunction at the earliest
stages of cognitive decline and support a model of neurodegeneration consequent to myelin pathology and
occurring long before the detection of aggregates.
Here we take an interdisciplinary biophysical and cellular approach that leverages expertise in tau
biochemistry and glial biology, in order to test this hypothesis. In aim1 we will develop quantitative
metrics for defining tau condensates – a crucial advance necessary for understanding how tau condensates
are modulated. In aim 2 we will determine the influence of tau pathological variants and myelin protein
and lipids on tau condensate properties. In aim 3 we shall examine the role of endogenously expressed
and exogenously uptaken tau and tau variants in oligodendrocyte lineage cells at specific stages of
differentiation.
Together, results from this work will illuminate the role of tau condensates in oligodendrocytes and further
our knowledge of the events occurring at the early stages of tau pathology."

 Cortical circuits, comprising specialized neuron subpopulations and their selective synaptic connections,
send output to long-distance cortical and subcortical targets via two distinct classes of projection neurons:
intratelencephalic (IT) neurons that project primary within and across cortical hemispheres, and pyramidal tract
(PT) neurons that project to deep subcortical targets (e.g., the thalamus and brainstem). Cortical circuits are
regulated by a variety of modulatory neurotransmitters, such as serotonin (5-HT) and acetylcholine (ACh), that
optimize circuit performance for different cognitive tasks. Indeed, disruption of serotonergic or cholinergic
signaling in the cortex impairs cognition and normal behavior, and both transmitter systems are implicated in a
range of psychiatric diseases. Therefore, revealing the physiological mechanisms by which 5-HT and ACh
influence cortical processing will enhance our understanding of normal cognition, and will advance the
development of novel therapeutic strategies for psychiatric patients.
 In the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), 5-HT and ACh act via G-protein-coupled receptors to reciprocally
regulate the postsynaptic excitability of IT and PT neurons. 5-HT promotes IT neuron output, but suppresses
PT neurons. Conversely, ACh preferentially excites PT neurons, but has limited impact on IT neurons.
Regardless of neuromodulatory state, action potential generation in IT and PT neurons requires excitatory
synaptic drive that may also be regulated, at the presynaptic level, by 5-HT and/or ACh. Our pilot studies
suggest that 5-HT and ACh act differentially to regulate key excitatory afferents to IT and PT neurons. This
current project will test the overarching hypothesis that 5-HT and ACh bias the “throughput” of cortical circuits
via coordinated pre- and postsynaptic regulation of specific combinations of excitatory afferent and cortical
projection target neuron subtype. Our first aim is to map the relative targeting, and functional excitatory drive,
of IT and PT neurons by key extrinsic excitatory afferents to the mouse medial PFC. Our second aim is to test
for afferent-specific presynaptic regulation by 5-HT and ACh, thereby determining whether pre- and
postsynaptic neuromodulation is coordinated to facilitate specific combinations of afferent input and cortical
projection output. Our third aim is to test whether 5-HT and/or ACh regulate local circuit communication
between IT and PT neurons in a manner consistent with the opposing postsynaptic impacts of these
modulators on excitability.
 Completion of these aims will establish a rigorous, circuit-based framework for understanding cholinergic
and serotonergic regulation of cognitive function, and will provide insight into how disruptions of
neuromodulatory circuits contribute to psychiatric disease."

The understanding of processes that lead to age-related decline in muscle mass and its consequences has been
fundamentally limited by imperfect methods of assessing total muscle mass. This has slowed the development
of interventions to prevent skeletal muscle loss. The long-term goal of this research is to gain a better
understanding of the causes and consequences of low total muscle mass in older adults. The objectives of this
project are to measure total muscle mass via the D3-creatine dilution method and determine its association with
genetic and non-genetic risk factors, and their relation with falls, injurious falls and fractures in two large,
community-based cohorts of older adults. This technique provides a direct and accurate estimate of total muscle
mass from a single, fasting urine specimen. The central hypotheses are that lower total muscle mass is
associated with novel genetic variants, which when used as instrumental variables in a Mendelian randomization
analysis will demonstrate that lower total muscle mass directly increases the risk of incident falls, injurious falls
and fractures. Furthermore, association of lifestyle predictors (diet and physical activity) with total muscle mass
and with accelerated loss of total muscle mass will be partly mediated by inflammation marker interleukin-6 (IL-
6). Guided by strong preliminary data this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims using up to
3,200 participants from two well-characterized cohorts, the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and the Osteoporotic
Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study. Aim 1 will identify genetic variants associated with total muscle mass estimated
by D3-creatine dilution in the FHS and MrOS cohorts by performing a genome-wide association study
(GWAS).The availability of additional cohorts with D3-creatine and genotyping will bring the sample size to 8,400.
Aim 2 will determine the causal relation between total muscle mass estimated by D3-creatine dilution and incident
falls, injurious falls and fractures by using SNPs identified in Aim 1 as instrumental variables for total muscle
mass in a Mendelian Randomization analysis in the FHS and MrOS cohorts. Aim 3 will determine the cross-
sectional associations of physical activity, dietary protein, essential amino acids (EAA), branched chain amino
acids (BCAA) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-PUFA) with baseline total muscle mass in the FHS and
MrOS cohorts as well as associations with the change in total muscle mass over an 18 month period in the FHS
cohort. To minimize the chance of confounding, Aim 3 will also use a previously published GWAS on
accelerometry derived physical activity to perform a Mendelian Randomization analysis of accelerometry derived
physical activity and total muscle mass. Lastly, Aim 3b will determine the implied indirect effect of activity and
diet on muscle mass along a pathway delineated by IL-6.
This study has the potential to transform the field in terms of defining the impact of reduced muscle mass
measured using a valid technology, D3-creatine dilution, which could also ultimately serve as an endpoint in drug

Characterizing flavors in tobacco products are associated with increased tobacco use initiation, reinforcement,
and difficulty quitting. In addition to characterizing flavors, tobacco products contain odorless sensory additives
such as sweeteners and synthetic cooling agents found in e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products.
Because these chemicals are odorless, they may not be considered characterizing flavors under current FDA
definitions and may continue to be added to tobacco products even when characterizing flavors are banned.
Solvent/humectant composition of e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, with different combinations of propylene
glycol and glycerol, and different levels of irritancy and sweetness, may also affect product perceptions.
Moreover, certain forms of recently introduced synthetic nicotine may also affect the sensory properties of
tobacco products and alter nicotine use behaviors. The effects of these odorless constituents (sweeteners,
synthetic cooling agents, solvents, and synthetic nicotine) on youth and adult tobacco product use, especially in
the critical context of transition from intermittent adolescent use to persistent adult tobacco use, remain poorly
understood. We propose to determine how these odorless constituents alter the sensory and addictive
properties of nicotine at different ages, and how early intermittent exposure to products containing these
constituents alters nicotine use behaviors in adulthood. Specifically, we will assess the effects of odorless
constituents on sensory and addictive properties of nicotine in adolescent and adult rodents (Aim 1). We will use
rodent taste reactivity and respiratory exposure assays to determine whether sweeteners, cooling agents, and
solvents modulate oral and respiratory sensory responses to tobacco-derived and synthetic nicotine
stereoisomers. We will also examine the effects of synthetic cooling agents on nicotine use behaviors (initiation,
maintenance, withdrawal, reinstatement) and nicotine-induced dopamine release in brain (brain reward system).
We will evaluate interactive effects of cooling agents, solvent ratios, and nicotine enantiomers on nicotine use
behaviors using operant vapor self-administration. In addition, we will examine how intermittent exposure to
odorless constituents in vapor or oral nicotine in adolescent rodents affects nicotine use behaviors in adulthood
(Aim 2). We will use a mixed vapor passive exposure and self-administration model as well as choice drinking
assays to evaluate and compare the effects of intermittent exposure and preconditioning to sweetener and
synthetic coolants or characterizing flavors during adolescence. We will determine whether exposure to these
additives alters adult nicotine seeking, dependence, reward-related behaviors, and brain dopamine release later
in life. Our findings will also evaluate the role of sex and age in the effects of odorless constituents on tobacco
use. Project outcomes will provide information to the FDA about the impact of odorless chemicals on sensory
and addictive properties of nicotine, and their effect on the transition from adolescent nicotine use to adulthood
use."

Nicotine is the key addictive ingredient of tobacco. The FDA is considering a regulatory strategy aiming to
reduce the nicotine content of tobacco products to “non-addictive” levels to prevent the development of
addiction among youth experimenting with tobacco products. The implementation of such a strategy would
require strong scientific support from a range of preclinical and clinical studies. However, there are gaps in our
current knowledge about the actual threshold for nicotine's addictive effects and whether this threshold varies
across individuals or with flavors that are commonly added to inhaled tobacco products. Studies aiming to
address these gaps are hampered by difficulty in delivering accurate doses of nicotine through cigarette
smoking or e-cigarettes. Further, separating nicotine's effects from multiple other chemicals that are inhaled
with nicotine remains a challenge. Among pure nicotine options, the intravenous (IV) route is the gold standard
for preclinical research and is increasingly used in clinical studies as well. IV route approximates the inhaled
delivery for nicotine pharmacokinetics, and it also produces reinforcing and subjective-rewarding effects. In a
series of pilot studies, we refined our IV nicotine procedure to better model puff-sized nicotine delivered by
smoking cigarettes or e-cigarettes and to allow assessment of nicotine's dose-dependent effect on multiple
addiction-related outcomes, including reinforcement, drug discrimination, and subjective-rewarding effects.
Using this method, we propose to determine benchmarks regarding the addictive threshold of nicotine and the
impact of sweeteners on this threshold. Specifically, we will 1) determine the nicotine threshold dose(s) for
reinforcement, discrimination, and subjective-rewarding effects in smokers (Aim 1) and 2) evaluate whether
these threshold doses change with inhaled sweetener (sucralose), administered by e-cigarettes concurrent
with IV nicotine infusions (Aim 2). For both Aims, we will use a placebo-controlled study that will recruit male
and female cigarette smokers. For Aim 1, in each of the 4 test sessions, a different nicotine dose (0.1, 0.05,
0.025, and 0.0125 mg nicotine/pulse) will be compared to saline for reinforcement, nicotine discrimination, and
subjective effects. Concurrently with the pulsed infusions, participants will inhale unflavored e-cigarettes, which
will allow a closer matching of the sensory aspects of inhaled tobacco use. To assess the effect of sweeteners
in Aim 2, participants in a placebo-controlled study will have 6 test sessions. Each Test Session will include
one of the 3 nicotine doses (selected from Aim 1) vs. saline, all combined with or without the sweetener
sucralose. Sweetener and control solution will be administered by e-cigarettes concurrent with IV infusions. By
providing novel information on the addictive threshold of nicotine and the impact of sweeteners on this
threshold, the results of this study will inform the FDA in setting science-based benchmarks for reducing the
risks from tobacco products."

The appeal and addiction potential of e-cigarettes (e-cigs) is influenced by constituents like nicotine (the
primary reinforcer that produces sensory irritation) and cooling flavorants (which improve flavor and can reduce
irritation). The tobacco marketplace is constantly introducing “disruptive innovations” in e-cigs, which may
impact appeal and addiction potential. Two recent entrants into the marketplace that are widely available in e-
cigs are the synthetic coolant WS-3 and synthetic nicotine, manufactured in the lab and is not from the tobacco
plant. The FDA has regulatory authority over these constituents, but little is known about their impact. This
proposal will use established human e-cig exposure models to conduct the first studies comparing synthetic
WS-3 vs. traditional coolants (i.e. menthol) and synthetic nicotine vs. tobacco-derived among those who use e-
cigs, to get consistent and reliable reports on user experiences.
Aim 1 will characterize user experiences to nicotine e-liquids with the synthetic coolant WS-3 alone, when
combined with menthol, and in comparison to menthol alone. After pilot testing to determine optimal WS-
3/menthol concentrations, adult users of e-cigs (50% with combustible tobacco use) will be exposed to three
WS-3 concentrations (no WS-3, low, high) in combination with three menthol concentrations (no menthol, low,
high; 9 total exposures) in a nicotine containing e-cig. Addiction potential and appeal will be examined with
hypothesized similar increases in additional potential/appeal for menthol and WS-3 and additive effects when
combined. Secondary and exploratory analyses with examine interactive effects of WS-3 and menthol and
influence of predictors (e.g. age, sex, combustible tobacco use, nicotine dependence) on outcomes. Aim 2 will
characterize user experiences to nicotine e-liquids with synthetic nicotine and menthol. In separate lab
sessions, adult users of e-cigs (50% with combustible tobacco use) will be exposed to synthetic nicotine in
tobacco and menthol flavor and tobacco derived nicotine in tobacco and menthol flavor in nicotine containing
e-cigs. Addiction potential and appeal will be examined across conditions and repeated exposure to each
condition will be used to examine withdrawal effects. We hypothesize synthetic nicotine will have greater
appeal and addiction potential than tobacco-derived nicotine. Secondary and exploratory effects will examine
the flavor and nicotine form interactions and influence of predictors (e.g. age, sex, combustible tobacco use,
nicotine dependence) on outcomes. These pivotal and rigorous experiments will inform future research and
regulatory needs to balance the impact of these synthetic constituents on initiation and harm reduction."
10934555,"PROJECT 4 ABSTRACT
Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death. Thus, better population-based
strategies are urgently needed to reduce cigarette smoking and tobacco-related harm. One approach is to
improve regulation of cigarettes and other tobacco products, which is a core mission of the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) under the Tobacco Control Act. Indeed, the FDA has signaled its intention to ban
menthol and lower nicotine concentrations in cigarettes to protect public health. The FDA may consider similar
product standards that restrict flavors and lower nicotine concentrations in non-combustible products as well.
However, scientific data is needed to understand the impact of these regulations. For example, the FDA has
approved only tobacco flavored e-cigarettes for marketing so far, in both high and moderate nicotine
concentrations, and is still evaluating premarket tobacco product applications for menthol non-combustible
products. Although e-cigarettes and pouches may help adults reduce smoking and smoking-related harm, it
remains to be determined whether menthol flavor and higher nicotine concentrations in non-combustible
products are important for cigarette substitution in adults. To inform tobacco regulatory policies of e-cigs and
pouches, we propose to conduct a controlled trial of the effects of non-combustible tobacco product
type and constituents on smoking behaviors in adults. Specifically, we will randomize adults who currently
smoke cigarettes (N=256) to switch to either e-cigs or pouches for 4-weeks and will also randomly assign
participants to four possible regulatory scenarios within product where flavor availability is either menthol and
tobacco/unflavored or tobacco/unflavored only, and nicotine concentration is either high (5% e-cig or 6mg
pouch) or moderate (2.4% e-cig or 3mg pouch). The design will yield 8 conditions (N=32 participants each).
Data from these participants will be used to compare the effects of product type, flavor availability, and nicotine
concentration on cigarette smoking behaviors and dependence using validated self-report measures and
biomarkers (Aim 1), and to assess the effects of these conditions on e-cig/pouch use behaviors and appeal
using validated self-report measures and biomarkers (Aim 2). In addition, we will explore potential interactions
between conditions (e.g., flavor availability and nicotine concentration) and participant characteristics (sex,
race/ethnicity, menthol cigarette preference, and baseline nicotine dependence level) (Aim 3). Our analyses
will provide key information on which individuals may be more likely to switch completely from smoking to non-
combustible products and whether certain flavors or nicotine concentrations in these products are important for
cigarette substitution and appeal among adults. This project focuses on key FDA priority areas of behavior,
addiction, and impact analysis. Our results will provide crucial evidence to the FDA about non-combustible
product standards for flavor and nicotine to maximize their potential benefit on cigarette smoking and tobacco
harm reduction."
10934558,"ABSTRACT: ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The success of the Yale Center for the Study of Tobacco Products (YCSTP) requires coordinated efforts at
many levels. In a role similar to its function for TCORS 1.0 and 2.0, the Administrative Core will provide the
centralized oversight required to effectively and efficiently run the Center’s primary Projects and pilots.
The Administrative Core also will ensure productive collaboration both within the YCSTP and with external
partners including the FDA, the TCORS Coordinating Center, and other TCORS. To carry out its duties, the
Administrative Core has five specific aims: 1) to provide scientific oversight and monitoring of YCSTP activities
internally via the YCSTP Executive Committee (Project/Core Leads and NIDA/CTP liaisons) and in
consultation with our center’s Data Safety and Monitoring Board, Scientific Advisory Board, and Community
Advisory Board, 2) to manage Center activities related to progress through coordinating timely training of
research staff on central study assessments as well as participant recruitment and retention, monitoring safety,
and submitting biannual reports on the progress of all projects, 3) to manage and share data by creating and
maintaining datasets for internal use and preparing limited and/or public datasets for external use, 4) to provide
oversight of regulatory, fiscal, and dissemination activities to ensure that YCSTP resources are used
appropriately and efficiently and that findings are disseminated through a variety of sources including docket
submissions, press releases, academic presentations and publications, and presentations within the
community, and 5) to facilitate communication and collaboration within the Center and with NIH, FDA, the
Coordinating Center, and other TCORS. Overall, the activities of the Administrative Core are essential to
supporting the timely completion of the proposed research and providing the FDA-CTP with the evidence
required to support the regulation of tobacco products. As in TCORS 1.0 and 2.0, the Administrative Core will
be led by the PIs for the YCSTP, Drs. Suchitra Krishnan-Sarin and Stephanie O’Malley."
10808110,"Project Summary: The overarching goal of this project is to provide Dr. Jackman with a rich training program
that adequately prepares him to become an independent investigator focused on the development and
implementation of digital healthcare interventions to address health disparities among minoritized populations.
The United States has experienced record-breaking highs in sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence and
persistent disparities in STIs and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections and sequelae among
adolescent and young adult (AYA), low income, and Black/African-American populations. Serious adverse
health consequences are attributable to STIs, including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy,
congenital syphilis, HIV, and infertility in an estimated 20,000 U.S. women annually. Patient centered clinical
decision support (PC CDS) are personalized, patient-centric, patient-facing digital healthcare applications used
to deliver patient care between health visits. This proposed program will leverage the electronic health record
(EHR) patient portal in a novel PC CDS intervention to optimize sexual health decision making, partner
communication, and uptake of clinical services among AYA aged 15 to 25 years in Baltimore, MD. Preliminary
studies demonstrate the promise of EHR patient portal-based interventions to help youth overcome barriers
such as, limited STI/HIV testing and treatment access, the stigma that often leads to non-disclosure, disclosure
inaccuracies, and access to high quality and accurate STI/HIV-related information and resources. Recently,
language included in the 21st Century Cures Act Final Rule, National HIV/AIDS Strategy, and STI National
Strategic Plan bolsters patient portals as a critical tool for improving patient healthcare engagement. However,
as reliance on patient portals and telehealth services have increased since the COVID-19 pandemic, so does
the risk of perpetuating inequities in healthcare access among socioeconomically underserved youth. Yet,
there is a considerable lack of interventions designed using a paradigm that amplifies the unique voices and
experiences of minoritized AYA end-users to meet their healthcare engagement needs and preferences for
STI/HIV prevention through the patient portal. This mentored research career development award is designed
to provide the necessary training to excel in digital healthcare research focused on reducing health disparities
and contribute to the public health informatics sciences. Research aims are to: (a) Describe longitudinal
patterns and correlates of EHR patient portal use among urban AYA patients in a large academic health
system; (b) Use a design thinking process to develop a PC CDS intervention to support the uptake of STI/HIV
prevention services and behaviors among urban AYA patients via the EHR patient portal, and (c) Conduct a 3-
month pilot study to determine feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. This study will provide crucial
preliminary data to inform the design of an R01-funded randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of a
novel PC CDS intervention to optimize patient portal engagement and reduce STI/HIV risk among urban AYA."
10773203,"ABSTRACT
Dr. Fei Li Kuang is an Assistant Professor in the Division of Allergy and Immunology at Northwestern
University Feinberg School of Medicine. Her clinical and research interests focus on eosinophilic disorders,
including eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs), inflammatory diseases defined by excessive
numbers of GI tissue eosinophils as result of an inappropriate prolonged Th2 response to food antigens.
Both eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and non-esophageal EGIDs such as eosinophilic gastritis/duodenitis
(EG/EoD) are associated with significant morbidity and have a profoundly negative impact on quality of life.
When untreated, there is progressive scarring of the affected GI tract segments that is not easily reversible.
While both eosinophils and specialized Th2 cells are implicated in EGID pathogenesis, numerous
questions remain as to their precise roles. This application proposes to focus on what is different about
eosinophils in EGID as compared to myriad number of other eosinophilic disorders accompanied by
excessive blood eosinophilia. Similarly, specialized Th2 cells are invoked to be biomarkers of disease in
IgE-mediated disorders such as food allergy and allergic rhino-conjunctivitis, which are markedly different
allergic diseases from EGID, so what makes these cells different in EGID will also be examined.
This career development award, under the mentorship of Dr. Bruce Bochner, focuses on investigating the
cellular and molecular mechanisms of EGID pathogenesis. to advance the understanding of this disease
process. Dr. Kuang has preliminary evidence suggesting that there are unique blood eosinophil signatures
in EGIDs that distinguish them from blood eosinophils in other eosinophilic disorders, and that specialized
circulating Th2 cells in EGIDs differ from those identified in more traditional IgE-mediated atopic conditions,
and that quantitative and qualitative changes in both cell types track with response to therapy and disease
remission. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that unique blood eosinophil and T lymphocyte
signatures define EGID as a clinical entity distinct from other eosinophilic disorders or food-
triggered diseases. This will be addressed by 3 non-overlapping but complementary aims: 1) Definition
of unique blood eosinophil signatures in EGID that distinguish it from other eosinophil-associated
disorders or atopic disorders with blood eosinophilia; 2) Precise identification of the specialized Th2 cells
in EGID as compared to food allergy; 3) Evaluation of the effect of dietary and steroid treatment on blood
eosinophil and specialized Th2 lymphocyte signatures in EGID
This innovative study will use novel data generated by Dr. Kuang to further investigate areas of EGID that
are currently poorly understood. Importantly, this award will provide Dr. Kuang with additional career
development and training needed to build her own successful research team, establish independence from
her mentor and significantly advance her career studying EGID pathogenesis."

Impairments in executive functioning (EF), cognitive processes that support self-regulation, disproportionately
impact children living in poverty and increase vulnerability for childhood disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs;
oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder), which trigger a cascade of mental health problems and
psychosocial difficulties across the lifespan. Poverty-related stress and maladaptive parenting styles have
been linked to alterations of neural and behavioral EF markers in children; despite this, no studies have studied
if parenting prevention programs can directly target childhood EF, and through improving EF, reduce disruptive
behaviors in at-risk children. This K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award
application seeks to conduct a mechanistic randomized clinical trial to determine whether neural-behavioral
indices of childhood EF is an experimental therapeutic target that can be modified via caregiver participation in
the Chicago Parent Program (CPP; Aim 1). Consistent with the NIMH Research Domain Criteria framework,
childhood EF will be assessed across multiple levels of analysis (electroencephalogram [EEG], behavior,
survey). The project also seeks to evaluate whether increases in childhood neural-behavioral EF mediate the
effects of CPP in reducing disruptive behavior problems over a short-term follow-up (Aim 2). The project will
also explore whether increases in specific parenting practices (discipline, scaffolding), previously linked to
individual differences in EF, mediate the effects of CPP in predicting change in childhood neural-behavioral EF
(Aim 3). The sample will include 90 Medicaid eligible parent-child (ages 4-5 years old) dyads; and will employ a
novel recruitment approach where the target child will have moderate-to-severe EF delays at baseline but does
not meet diagnostic criteria for a DBD. Consistent with the candidate's translational clinical scientist career
goals, the candidate seeks crucial training in: community-based research and dissemination and
implementation science, advanced EEG methods to evaluate neural-behavioral EF targets of preventive
interventions, and statistical skills to design and evaluate clinical trials. Training will occur in an outstanding
interdisciplinary environment at the University of Illinois at Chicago, in the Department of Psychiatry and
leverage the department's established strengths in community mental health services research, dissemination
and implementation science, and affective neuroscience. Mentors Drs. Atkins, Fitzgerald and Bhaumik and
consultants Drs. Klumpp, Wakschlag, Gross, and Handley have expertise in the training areas and extensive
histories of early career mentorship, and will work together to ensure the candidate's successful transition to
research independence. Study findings will support an R01 application to validate the results on a larger scale
and launch the candidate's academic career as a preventive intervention scientist. Findings have significant
potential to identify whether CPP, a cost-efficient parenting intervention, modifies neural-behavioral EF indices
in urban poor children, a theorized etiological risk mechanism of DBDs, and therefore prevent DBDs."

10820510,"ABSTRACT:
Ventilator associated pneumonias (VAP) are a common complication in mechanically ventilated patients,
occurring more than 250,000 times annually. VAPs occur in a high percentage of mechanically ventilated
patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 29%) and COVID-19 (>50%). Timely detection and
identification of the pathogen is key to effective treatment, as is differentiating colonization from acute infection.
The most common options for microbiological diagnosis are cultures of endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar
lavage. Sampling aspirate is non-invasive, but the samples are prone to contamination from the proximal
airways. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) allows for sample collection from the distal lung without proximal airway
contamination, but this technique is invasive and cannot be repeated frequently for surveillance. Here we
propose to develop and test a non-invasive, high-efficiency system for collecting exhaled respiratory aerosols
from mechanically ventilated patients. This system will collect large aerosols, typically generated in the proximal
airways, separately from smaller aerosols, which are typically generated in the very distal airways, thus providing
independent samples from these two distinct compartments of the lung. The collection of a sample from the
distal lung will facilitate the correct diagnosis VAP. The system will allow for short sample collection times,
facilitating repeated measures and timely surveillance, and will be developed and tested in an ex vivo human
lung model using culture and non-culture-based methods. We will also evaluate the utility of collected aerosol
samples for surveying the microbial, fungal, and viral community members in the lung (the lung microbiome).
Misbalances in the bacterial communities (respiratory dysbiosis) have been associated with decreased survival
in mechanically ventilated patients and may play a role in both local and systemic inflammation. Finally, we will
evaluate the use of exhaled aerosol samples to indicate host response to infection and lung injury through the
analysis of biomarkers related to endothelial and epithelial permeability, inflammation, and infection. Markers of
host response and lung injury may help to differentiate simple bacterial colonization from acute infection and
VAP. Pneumonia is the leading cause of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), an often-lethal
complication involving a complex dysregulated inflammatory response that causes loss of endothelial and
epithelial barrier integrity, resulting in pulmonary edema and respiratory failure. Serial biomarker measurements
from distal lung samples may also elucidate the etiology of ARDS after lung infection."
10897728,"PROJECT SUMMARY
For continuous speech to be perceived as intelligible, the brain employs an extended series of representations
along the auditory pathway, emphasizing different temporal features of speech at each stage. From brainstem
to midbrain, thalamus, and through multiple cortical areas, these stages support representations of fast pitch-
relevant periodicity, slower representations corresponding to vocal-tract/envelope modulations, and ultimately,
linguistic and semantic representations. Furthermore, the strength of these representations is not determined
solely in a feedforward way, but also by top-down processes, modulated by attention and listening effort.
It is well known that degradation of a speech signal will interfere with these neural representations in different
ways: some losses are irreparable, but others can be compensated for at a later stage. A gap in knowledge
arises because the different neural stages, and the corresponding continuous speech representations, are
rarely studied as a longitudinal chain. Partial failure at one processing level might be compensated for at a
subsequent level, and the level of compensation might be associated with the level of listening effort.
The specific objectives of this application are to determine how continuous speech is progressively
represented along and beyond the auditory pathway, from midbrain to language areas, in young normal-
hearing listeners. Both electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) will be employed
for their high time resolution, simultaneously recording from subcortical and multiple cortical areas
respectively, along with measures of behavior, and listening effort. The speech representations of different
neural stages will be quantified by specified measures of time-locked neural processing and of neural
connectivity. Pupillometry measures will be used as a physiological proxy for listening effort, in addition to self-
reported effort measures. Our central hypothesis is that a grounded understanding of the progression of
representations of continuous speech processing, viewed as a network with both feedforward and feedback
connectivity (and including task-based and effort-linked connectivity changes), will elucidate the acoustic and
neural conditions under which continuous speech is ultimately perceived as intelligible.
Aim 1 investigates a broad set of neural measures of continuous speech processing, simultaneously obtained
along and beyond the auditory pathway, and the extent to which they can predict intelligibility. Aim 2
investigates the extent to which also incorporating measures of sustained listening effort, in concert with the
above neural measures of continuous speech processing, may allow better predictions of intelligibility than the
neural measures alone. Aim 3 investigates the functional role of neural connectivity in supporting continuous
speech processing along the auditory pathway and beyond."

Title: Ecology and genetics of insecticide resistance in African malaria vectors
The current first-line vector control methods rely on pyrethroid-based long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and
indoor residual spraying (IRS). Insecticide-resistant vector genotypes are selected, leading to widespread of
insecticide resistance in sub-Saharan Africa. The evolution of insecticide resistance is threatening to reverse the
global gains in malaria control1,2. Due to the increasing insecticide resistance in sub-Saharan Africa, pyrethroid-
based synergized next generation bednets were recently introduced in many African countries to overcome the
challenge of insecticide resistance. These nets contain synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) which inhibits the
activity of pyrethroid detoxifying cytochrome P450 enzymes by forming a metabolite-inhibitory complex with the
enzyme. However, little is known about how African malaria vectors respond to PBO exposure at the gene
transcription, biochemical and organismal level. It has been shown that in insecticide-sensitive Drosophila that
PBO is capable of inducing the expression of the P450 and GST detoxification gene families. The increased
production of P450 and GST enzymes by PBO exposure has the potential to increase insecticide tolerance. If
this is true to malaria vectors, the impact of PBO on insecticide resistance mitigation is limited. The central
objective of this continuation application is to better understand the ecology and genetics of insecticide
resistance in the face of pyrethroid synergized nets introduction in the major African malaria vectors in
western Kenya where we maintain selected pyrethroid resistant strains and PBO nets are being widely
distributed in some counties. To achieve this goal three aims are developed. In aim 1, we will examine the
impact of next-generation PBO bednets on vector bionomics and transmission reduction. Data from this will
inform the effectiveness of PBO nets in transmission reduction in areas with pre-existing high pyrethroid
resistance. In aim 2, we will determine the genetic basis of variations in mosquito phenotypes due to PBO nets.
This aim will provide information on importance of the different mechanisms of insecticide resistance that exist
in western Kenya which is critical to the development of PBO net deployment strategy. In aim 3, we will determine
the response to PBO exposure at the gene transcription and biochemical level in pyrethroid resistant malaria
vectors. Data from this aim can provide critical information on the genetic mechanisms and risks of PBO synergist
in resistance mitigation in field malaria vector populations with high resistance. Overall, these 3 aims will inform
PBO net deployment strategy, impact on transmission reduction and potential risks on its inability to mitigate
resistance."

Despite the significant human health and disease burden in Africa, no biomedical data science graduate degree
programmes in computational omics, clinical informatics and translational research are offered on the continent.
To foster research training that will cultivate graduates able to respond with agility to future biomedical data
science needs and develop innovative solutions to address African health challenges, formal interdisciplinary
training in biomedical data science is needed. Such training opportunities should include: (i) Biomedical data
science applied to data from multi-omics and other technologies, such as biomedical imaging, coupled with the
ethical, legal and social Implications of these advances; (ii) Fundamental and advanced concepts in machine
intelligence and computational paradigms for developing novel approaches for mining large-scale biomedical
data; and (iii) Awareness, amongst graduates, of career opportunities within biomedical data science along with
how the soft and hard skills gained in the training program could be transferred into a range of
biotechnology/biomedical industries and research/professional careers.
Motivated by these needs and leveraging the expertise in clinical and translational research as well as biomedical
informatics at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), we propose to develop the “Computational Omics
and Biomedical Informatics Program” (COBIP) at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. The program will
introduce graduate degree programs to train African biomedical data scientists and faculty in rigorous
fundamental data science, computational omics, clinical informatics and imaging data science. COBIP will lead
to the development of solutions that address the African disease burden and are relevant to global health.
Specifically, we aim to: 1) Develop an interdisciplinary data science training program focused on the health and
healthcare needs and priorities of Africa; 2) Train faculty with relevant disciplinary backgrounds, from
collaborating African institutions, in biomedical data science to support the development of the field across the
continent; and 3) Establish COBIP as an international center of excellence in computational omics and
biomedical informatics, distributed across African institutions as a collaborative network of faculty, researchers,
and students focused on the African health priorities.
COBIP will attract cohorts of trainees from diverse backgrounds including mathematics, statistics, informatics,
computer sciences, engineering and biomedical sciences. COBIP will provide innovative educational
infrastructure and research opportunities as well as links between clinicians, researchers and biomedical
industries through placements and internships. COBIP, through its graduates, will have decisive impacts on
African biomedical data science research and stimulate diagnostics, therapeutic selection and drug development
to support improved human health and healthcare in Africa and globally."
10862584,"SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
A major fraction of heritability for common diseases, as well as for the penetrance and expressivity of rare
diseases, partitions to distal regulatory elements in the human genome, overwhelmingly cell type-specific
enhancers. However, a rate-limiting challenge for the field has been how to identify the specific variants,
elements and regulated genes that mediate these effects on disease liability. Towards the overall goals of the
Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) Consortium, we propose to test over one million human
regulatory elements or variants for their functional effects on transcriptional regulation, as well as to query over
100,000 distal regulatory elements for the gene(s) that they regulate. A first theme of our proposal is the diversity
of multiplex technologies that we will employ to these ends, including massively parallel reporter assays
(MPRAs), crisprQTL, saturation genome editing, multiplex prime editing and single cell combinatorial indexing,
many of which we pioneered. A second theme is a focus on dynamic cellular systems that enable a given library
of variants and/or elements to be tested across a broad range of cell types and states within a single experiment;
these will include ESC-derived neuronal progenitors, cardiomyocytes, embryoid bodies, gastruloids and
organoids, and in select cases, mice. A third theme involves leveraging our experience (e.g. CADD, a widely
used, genome-wide catalog of variant effect predictions) to support the overarching goals of IGVF. Specifically,
we envision using functional measurements generated by us and others to produce well-calibrated predictions
of enhancer activity and variant effects that are continuous along the branching trajectories that comprise human
development. Our specific aims are as follows: (1) To perform massively parallel validation and functional
characterization of candidate human enhancers in a broad range of cell type contexts. (2) To perform massively
parallel characterization of human genetic variants with potential roles in human disease. (3) To contribute to a
comprehensive variant-element-phenotype catalog while taking a leadership role in synergistic interactions
within IGVF, in the dissemination of methods, data and predictions, and in the overarching goals of the
consortium."

10923990,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Administrative Core 
American Indian and Alaska Native (ANAI) communities are increasingly asserting tribal sovereignty over 
research, setting their own research agendas, and building capacity to lead and conduct their own 
research. Southcentral Foundation (SCF), a tribal health care organization serving 65,000 ANAIs in 
Alaska, established a Research Department (RD) in 2006 to conduct health research for and by ANAI 
people that aligns with organizational and community priorities and values. Through implementation of 
training, grant management software, and expanded program evaluation, prior NARCH funding has 
strengthened the SCF RD's ability to administer and evaluate individual research projects within a diverse 
and burgeoning research portfolio. This Center will expand this portfolio with a focus on dissemination and 
implementation research designed to improve ANAI health outcomes and healthcare delivery. 
The overarching goal of the proposed Administrative Core is to position SCF to be competitive for large, 
multi-component National Institutes of Health center grants which have been awarded primarily to academic 
institutions. We will expand SCF's capacity—and create a new ANAI career pathway—to administer, 
communicate, and collaborate across multiple, simultaneous tribal research projects and teams and add 
critical capacity to systematically evaluate individual and collective research and capacity-building efforts. 
The Specific Aims of this project are to: 1) Implement an ANAI Research Administrator position and 
mentoring program to support the administrative, coordination, and communication needs of 
complex, multicomponent center grants; and 2): Institute a unified evaluation framework to 
assess research outcomes and processes, as well as capacity building efforts in a tribal health 
setting. We will develop and implement a curriculum to prepare Research Administrators to lead 
Center administrative tasks and ensure the Administrative Core effectively serves as the 
communication and coordination hub for study teams and partners and supports evaluation and 
oversight functions. We will use two complementary dissemination and implementation research 
frameworks (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance [RE-AIM] and the 
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research [CFIR]) to evaluate individual Center 
components and the Center overall to facilitate learning about implementation in tribal health systems. 
This effort will be led by Dr. Denise Dillard, an Inupiaq Eskimo psychologist who has served as the Director 
of the SCF RD since 2008. Julie Benson, Program Director of the $17.7 million Alaska IDeA Network of 
Biomedical Research Excellence, will serve as co-investigator."
10923995,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – RP1 
 Alaska Native and American Indian (ANAI) people are at increased risk for diabetes (DM) with documented 
prevalence of risk factors. Recent studies show that DM prevalence and incidence are rising and rates of pre- 
DM among the ANAI population in Alaska are as great, if not greater, than other U.S. groups. Additionally, 40% 
of DM is undiagnosed, thus increasing risk for DM complications. Since DM complications begin to develop 
during pre-DM, early screening and intervention can prevent or delay DM onset and its complications. 
 “Implementing a Diabetes Screening and Referral Service Developed for Dental Clinics within an Urban 
Alaska Native Health Care Setting” is a 4-year study that will use implementation science frameworks to assess 
acceptability, applicability, feasibility, and consequences of DM testing within Southcentral Foundation (SCF) 
Dental Clinics. SCF is a Tribal health organization providing primary care and dental services to ANAI people 
living within the urban Anchorage, Alaska area – home to nearly half of the ANAI population statewide. 
 Research indicates that in a given year, 27% of adults who do not have contact with a medical provider did 
visit a dental provider. The well-documented bidirectional relationship between DM and periodontal disease 
suggests that dental visits offer a largely untapped opportunity to screen persons at risk for DM and refer them 
to primary care providers for follow up and treatment. This opportunity is enhanced at SCF because dental and 
primary care services are provided within the same closed Tribal health system. 
 We propose a within-site post design, and phased approach to study the implementation of an evidenced- 
based preventive service – DM screening, brief intervention, and referral to primary care – delivered in a novel 
setting, dental clinics. Experienced clinical and implementation research experts will work with multiple 
stakeholders using two theoretical and complimentary dissemination and implementation science frameworks: 
Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) and the Consolidated Framework for 
Implementation Research (CFIR) to accomplish three specific aims (SAs): SA1: Identify barriers and facilitators 
to implementing a diabetes screening and referral service within SCF Dental and Primary Care Clinics. SA2: 
Develop a dental clinic diabetes screening and referral service that minimizes barriers and utilizes facilitators 
identified in SA1. SA3: Pilot, assess, and iteratively refine a diabetes screening and referral service delivered 
through SCF Dental Clinics."

researchers/neuroscientists; and (3) To expand the Research Community in this area, and increase extramural
funding for this understudied topic. This will be achieved through the following complementary aims: Aim 1. To
provide leadership to the Center. A multidisciplinary leadership structure will implement an administrative
and operational infrastructure that unites all components into a seamless Center that creates synergy across
the Cores. The Executive Leadership comprises the Director (A.M. Malfait), Associate Director (J.J. Jacobs),
and Resource Core Directors (R.E. Miller, R.J. Miller, D.R. Sumner). They will be advised by Internal and
External Advisory Boards with complementary expertise and diverse backgrounds; Aim 2. To coordinate,
integrate, and evaluate the Center components and activities. Management plans for the Center will
include fiscal administration, property and personnel management, planning, budgeting, coordination of
regulatory compliance, including vertebrate animal protection. Resource Cores and Enrichment Programs will
be evaluated on an ongoing basis, monthly at Executive Leadership meetings and bi-annually by the Advisory
Board. The Center will monitor current and predict future scientific needs of the research community; Aim 3.
To maintain effective communication with the Center’s Research Community, and the broader MSK
and pain research community. To achieve this, we will create and maintain a dedicated website (C-COMP
portal) that will be a one-stop source for information and a platform for exchange (dissemination of scientific
information, access to enrichment programs and RFAs for pilot grants) We will also disseminate information
through a monthly newsletter, e-mail blasts, Twitter, and a monthly blog; Aim 4. To design, implement,
manage, and grow an innovative and dynamic Enrichment Program. We are planning (1) Resource Core
outreach activities aiming to stimulate high-quality research and provide training through hands-on training and
tutorials made available through the portal, and online discussion groups; (2) Initiatives for expanding the
community and strengthening it through innovative, translational research will include a seminar series, an
Annual Investigators Meeting, a “Clinical Researcher Resource” panel, partnerships with affiliated Centers,
and a pilot grant program."

The overarching goal of the Chicago Center on Musculoskeletal Pain (C-COMP) is to foster and support
research and training aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying pain in musculoskeletal (MSK)
disease, with the ultimate goal of better managing and preventing it. Assessment of disease-specific pain-
related behaviors and other somatosensory changes in appropriate preclinical models of rheumatic and MSK
diseases is one of the cornerstones for the study of mechanisms underlying pain associated with these
diseases, necessary for the development of new therapeutics for MSK pain. The Behavioral Core B will
support this goal by providing unique resources, world class expertise, and effective training to assess
behavioral changes in animal models of MSK and rheumatic diseases. We will capitalize on our combined
expertise in models of osteoarthritis and other MSK diseases, and we will engage world class experts in rodent
pain behaviors to provide continued guidance. This approach will support much needed high-quality research
and training in this field and will facilitate a more wide-spread use of appropriate behavioral measures as
outcomes in preclinical studies of MSK disease. Such a service is a prerequisite for exploring mechanisms
underlying pain associated with MSK diseases, and for increasing the translational utility of animal models.
Ultimately, we expect that choosing the right behaviors in the right models will aid the development of novel,
safe, and efficacious analgesics. The behavioral assays offered in Core B have been chosen to synergize with
Neurobiology Core C, which will further enable mechanistic evaluation of pain pathways. Our own combined
cumulative experience and established innovation and international leadership in the behavioral
characterization of rodent models of MSK diseases provides us with unique qualifications to advise and
support researchers about the most efficient strategies to evaluate behavioral changes in MSK models. The
Core will achieve its objectives through the following aims: Aim 1. Establish a centralized resource to
facilitate behavioral assays in MSK disease models. We will provide a full panel of behavioral assays that
cover all types of somatosensory changes. The Core will provide hands-on training in animal behavioral
testing, customized protocols, equipment, and testing space. Aim 2. Provide a consultation service, and a
customized, full-service option for applying behavioral testing to preclinical models of arthritis and MSK
disease. The Core will provide scientific guidance for the design of studies and consulting services on how to
apply behavioral testing to MSK models. The Core will provide technical expertise to make customized, full-
service behavioral testing options available to laboratories, including labs outside of Chicago. Aim 3. Train the
research community in evaluating behavioral changes in models of arthritis and other MSK diseases.
We will provide both in person and virtual training, present seminars and develop educational material to
enhance Center investigators’ understanding of how to integrate behavioral testing into their laboratories."
10890645,"Although advances in hematology have led the way in many fields of basic and translational biomedical research,
hematologic diseases remain major threats to public health. For example, the prognosis for many hematologic
malignancies continues to be poor. Current treatments are inadequate to support a normal lifestyle for most
patients with sickle cell disease. In the U.S., at least 500,000 venous thromboembolic events, 1 million heart
attacks and 150,000 stroke deaths occur each year. At the same time, opportunities for hematology research
have never been more promising, and converting these opportunities into medical advances will depend upon
training the next generation of basic and translational hematology researchers. The Molecular Hematology train-
ing program proposes to fill this need for 5 predoctoral and 8 postdoctoral trainees per year. Predoctoral
Ph.D. and M.D./Ph.D. students follow the curriculum of the Washington University graduate school. After
passing their qualifying examination, they enter the laboratory of participating faculty Mentors for 3-4 years of
laboratory re-search to complete their dissertation. Postdoctoral Ph.D. trainees from around the world apply
to participating laboratories; postdoctoral M.D. and M.D./Ph.D. trainees usually have completed the clinical
training component of a Hematology-Oncology fellowship program at Washington University or elsewhere. The
duration of postdoc-toral training depends on prior experience. Those with Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D degrees
typically conduct research for 2-3 years before transitioning to an independent research position, whereas
those with an M.D. degree may benefit from 3-4 years of postdoctoral training. Trainees receive intensive
mentoring and career counseling, and participate in coursework, journal clubs, and seminars. The major
facilities of the program consist of ~80,000 square feet of fully-equipped laboratory space that house the
Divisions of Hematology and Oncology, as well as extensive institutional resources for genome sequencing,
immune monitoring, informatics, animal studies, and patient-oriented clinical research. The research topics
available to trainees reflect the multidisciplinary expertise of the participating Mentors and include:
pathogenesis of hemorrhagic and thrombotic disorders; regulation of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis; gene
therapy of hemophilia and lysosomal storage diseases; phosphoinosi-tide metabolism and cell signaling
pathways; mechanisms of hematopoiesis; telomerase defects in bone marrow failure syndromes; molecular
basis for protein trafficking in mammalian cells; role of platelets and angiogenesis in metastasis; biology of
human immunodeficiency and leukemia viruses; epithelial morphogenesis; pathogene-sis of leukemia,
myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and congenital neutropenia; cell cycle control;
programmed cell death in development and malignancy. Completion of this program will prepare talented
trainees for careers in basic and translational hematology research, to make discoveries that will transform the
diagnosis and treatment of hematologic diseases."
10914072,"Project Summary/Abstract
Lung cancer 5-year survival rates drop from 61% for early stage diagnosis to just 6% for late stage diagnosis.
Currently, fewer than 1 in 5 cases are diagnosed at an early stage. The increasing frequency of chest CT scans
and changes in lung cancer screening guidelines are expected to increase the number of incidentally discovered
lung lesions, representing an opportunity for earlier lung cancer diagnosis. Bronchoscopy is currently the safest,
least invasive, and least expensive diagnostic option, but its poor diagnostic yield greatly limits its procedural
beneﬁt. Even when advanced techniques like radial endobronchial ultrasound and electromagnetic navigation
are used, the diagnostic yield is just 50-60%. This is primarily due to challenges with intraoperative localization
of the bronchoscope prior to needle deployment. Additionally, access to these techniques is limited because they
require expensive equipment and unique expertise. Efforts relying on the bronchoscope's built-in camera require
no additional equipment or specialization, but have struggled with generalizability across individuals in part due
to limited data availability and assumptions about airway features.
 The objective of this proposal is to improve the success rate of traditional bronchoscopes by addressing limita-
tions in intraoperative localization using a data-driven model that is robust to differences in human anatomy. This
work has potential for signiﬁcant public health beneﬁt by (1) increasing early lung cancer detection, (2) reducing
morbidity and mortality by reducing the number of invasive procedures, and (3) making minimally invasive bron-
choscopy more accessible in areas without expert bronchoscopists. The proposed work will be accomplished via
two Speciﬁc Aims. In Aim 1, a dataset will be generated of virtual and real bronchoscopy videos with video-frame
matched six degrees-of-freedom poses (position and orientation in three-dimensions) of the bronchoscope's dis-
tal tip. This data will be made publicly available as the ﬁrst large dataset of its kind to promote future research and
reproducibility. In Aim 2, a real-time bronchoscope localization model will be developed using advances in ma-
chine learning, including deep neural networks, that have shown success in camera localization for non-medical
applications. These models will regress the pose of the bronchoscope's distal tip using current and past video
frames of the bronchoscope's built-in camera. The clinical utility of the system will be evaluated in simulation, 3D
printed lung phantoms, and ex-vivo porcine lung experiments. The research, tightly coupled clinical experience,
and associated training plan will provide a unique interdisciplinary skill-set in computer science, medical robotics,
and procedural medicine. The outstanding research and clinical environment for this training at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill ensures exceptional preparation for a career conducting cutting-edge research as
a physician-scientist in medical robotics."
10909034,"As the only NIMH-funded postdoctoral training program dedicated solely to suicide prevention research,
the CSPS T32 continues to shape the field. This application is for competitive renewal (Years 21 through 25) of
an NIMH Institutional National Research Service Award (T32 MH20061) titled, “Postdoctoral Training
Program in Suicide Prevention Research.” We seek support for six postdoctoral training slots. A
component of the University of Rochester’s (UR) Center for the Study of the Prevention Suicide (CSPS), the
“CSPS T32” has as its long-term objective to develop a cadre of early career scientists with the knowledge
and experience necessary to establish careers as independent investigators and members of interdisciplinary
teams dedicated to the study of suicide and its prevention. Training emphasizes suicide prevention research
consistent with the revised NIMH Strategic Plan for Research – 2020, which calls suicide “an urgent priority for
NIMH”. Fellows in psychology, public health, medicine, and related disciplines undergo a two-year training
sequence guided by an “individual development plan” designed by each fellow and her/his mentor at the outset
of training and annually. The curriculum includes a coordinated series of courses, seminars, and workshops
designed to provide the fellow with a firm foundation in the theories and methods of suicide prevention
research. Core areas of knowledge and skill development include (a) suicidology, (b) research methods, (c)
academic career development and “survival skills”, and (d) professional integrity and the ethical conduct of
research. Each fellow works with one or more Mentors selected from the UR faculty on development and
implementation of an individually tailored program of applied suicide prevention research. A third year of
mentored research training is available on a selective basis. An evaluation plan closely tracks the performance
of each trainee and, over the longer term, of the program itself in preparing its graduates for careers in
intervention, outcomes, and health services research in general and suicide prevention studies in particular.
 Suicide is a complex, multi-determined behavior. The CSPS T32 has been successful in recruiting fellows
who are from cultural and academic backgrounds that reflect the diverse perspectives needed to understand
suicide and its prevention. Retention through the program and into careers in suicide prevention research has
been excellent. Program innovations with this application include increased emphases on training in (a) the
use of digital technologies, artificial intelligence and health analytics in suicide prevention research; (b) the
translational neuroscience of suicide; (c) the role that sensory (hearing and vision) deficits play in suicide risk,
and the recruitment of fellows from those communities; and (d) the lived experience of individuals and families
affected by suicide. The fellowship is further enriched by the addition to its already robust network of
collaborators of linkages with (i) the UR Health Lab for digital technology innovation, (ii) the UR Del Monte
Institute for Neuroscience, (iii) UR Center for Eye and Brain Health."

Diabetic retinopathy is a disease of both neurons and vasculature in the retina. Visual function deficits and
neuronal retinal dysfunction from electroretinograms, are some of the earliest identifiable diabetic retinal
problems, especially in the dim light activated rod pathways. Dysfunction of the inner retina - bipolar cells that
receive rod input, ganglion cells that receive bipolar cell input and amacrine cells that modulate this pathway-
is tied to the development of serious diabetic retinal problems. We have shown deficits in light-evoked
responses of rod pathway inner retinal neurons that are not due to cell death, but the neuronal mechanisms
that cause these deficits are unknown and the focus of this proposal. We will identify how a loss in dopamine
and Ca2+ signaling in the inner retina impacts light evoked vision loss, and we will modulate these pathways to
determine if they can be future targets for preventing diabetic retinal dysfunction and the neuronal progression
of vision loss. Dopamine is released by dopaminergic amacrine cells to allow retinal adaptation to increasing
background light levels and GABA release from other amacrine cells modulates the timing and spatial
sensitivity of ganglion cells, increasing the sensitivity of vision to small stimuli. Using a mouse model of STZ
induced diabetes we have shown that dopamine receptor sensitivity and light adaptation in one type of
ganglion cell and Ca2+ signaling in amacrine cells in the rod pathway are reduced, suggesting that ganglion cell
output to the brain is altered leading to diabetic visual deficits. We will use our expertise in analyzing retinal
signaling to determine the roles of dopamine and Ca2+ signaling changes in the diabetic retina using
physiological signaling, genetically modified mouse models and optogenetic stimulation. In Aim 1 we will
determine if the diabetes induced reduction in dopamine levels reduces dopamine receptor sensitivity of the
inner retina in the rod pathway, using single cell electrophysiology recordings of the responses of rod bipolar
cells and ganglion cells to light and immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization analysis. In Aim 2 we will
determine if the release and retinal function of dopamine in light adaptation are reduced in diabetes, using
recordings of physiological responses to increasing background light levels at the single cell level, in vitro ERGs
and direct dopamine release measurements. In Aim 3 we will determine what diabetes induced changes in
amacrine cell Ca2+ signaling cause reduced rod pathway inhibition by stimulating multiple amacrine cell inputs
to the rod pathway directly either electrically or optogenetically and blocking specific components of Ca2+
signaling. These proposed studies will significantly expand our understanding of the mechanisms and
progression of early diabetic retinal neuronal damage and are part of our long term goal to develop targets for
therapeutics to intervene at an early time point of diabetic retinal damage and augment or complement existing
treatments to prevent the neuronal progression of vision loss."
10812467,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Heart failure and arrhythmias are the major clinical manifestations of genetic forms of cardiomyopathy, which
can be life-threatening and cause significant morbidity and mortality in these diseases. New patient/genotype-
specific therapies are in development and clinical testing for different forms of cardiomyopathy, however small
animal models insufficiently capture the clinically relevant patient disease phenotypes and genotypes. Patient-
specific human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can be created from readily available adult cells (e.g.,
blood, skin, or urine cells) and differentiated in heart-like cells, cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), offering
opportunities to evaluate new treatments in a human cardiomyocyte context. While hiPSC-CM models are
promising for disease modeling and drug testing, the cells are immature and often produce non-physiologic
outputs. Engineered heart tissues (EHTs) can be created by casting hiPSC-CMs into hydrogel matrices,
supported by flexible posts, to create tissue-like structures in the dish. EHTs improve cell maturity and provide
access to physiologic outputs like force of contraction. Arrhythmia modeling in EHTs, has proven more
challenging and has only been accomplished by invasive, terminal experiments requiring specialized dyes and
imaging equipment. The project aims to optimize the application of flexible electronics technology to EHT
culture conditions so that contractility and field potential can be evaluated as electrical and mechanical activity
simultaneously and noninvasively for indefinite time periods. This platform will enable personalized drug
testing like genetic correction strategies, which are currently in development. We developed a prototype
device employting this technology, which we named electromechanically-monitored EHTs (emEHTs). We
present demonstrating that emEHTs function to capture tissue strain and field potential on an array of sensors.
We propose to further validate this technology by characterizing device function from fabrication to long-term
culture, employing a standard product development quality improvement process to ensure consistent device
quality and outputs. To allow for more generalized adoptability, a graphical user interface will be developed for
collecting and analyzing device output. We will further validate this technology with advanced imaging
characterization of calcium and membrane voltage of emEHTs. Pharmacologic studies that assess both
contractility and arrhythmogenicity will be conducted to demonstrate potential for drug testing and screening.
Previously collected and reprogrammed hiPSCs from patients harboring mutations in genes known to be highly
arrhythmogenic will be assessed using emEHTs to demonstrate the potential of modeling genetic forms of
cardiomyopathy. This project will be co-led by an interdisciplinary team of cardiovascular researchers and
bioengineers with skill sets in clinical cardiology, arrhythmia modeling, cardiovascular genetics, and
microfabrication. Successful completion of this project will result in a well-validated working emEHT platform
for use by scientists with experience in hiPSC culture and differentiation methods."
10870091,"Project Summary/Abstract
In this competitive renewal, we continue our studies of synaptotagmin (syt) isoforms that regulate the release
of neurotransmitters and hormones. The founding member of this gene family, syt1, was discovered in 1981
and has been shown to function as the major Ca2+ sensor for synchronous synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis in
neurons. Surprisingly, the most fundamental property of syt1—it's ability to bind and become activated by
Ca2+—remains one of its least understood properties. Syt1 senses Ca2+ via tandem C2 domains, C2A and
C2B, and five acidic Ca2+ binding residues have been proposed to coordinate 2-3 Ca2+ ions per domain.
However, substitution of these residues in C2A has led to considerable confusion, with conflicting results as to
whether these mutations are loss- or gain-of-function or have no effect at all; C2B has been studied in even
less detail. In Aim 1 we propose quantitative experiments to compare the roles of each of these putative
ligands in binding Ca2+, via isothermal titration calorimetry, and in release, via Ca2+ dose-response
measurements of exocytosis using iGluSnFR. In Aim 2, we address the function of syt9, which is perhaps the
most misunderstood isoform. Syt9 is in the same clade as syt1 and was proposed to trigger SV release in
striatal neurons. Our preliminary data revealed that this is not the case; rather, syt9 is mainly targeted to
dense core vesicles in striatal neurons where it regulates the release of substance P, to indirectly control
spontaneous SV fusion rates. We will delve into this model by conducting syt9 structure-function studies using
both reconstituted fusion assays and syt9 KO neurons, and by conducting pharmacological experiments. We
will also expand this work to striatal slices, where substance P has been shown to strongly modulate dopamine
release. Importantly, dopaminergic transmission in the striatum plays a key role in addiction and schizophrenia.
So, we will conduct experiments to determine whether syt9-regulated substance P release modulates
dopamine release in this brain region. Finally, in Aim 3 we return to syt1, to compare its role in activity-
dependent SV docking with another isoform, syt7. SV docking dynamics have recently emerged as a key step
in numerous aspects of release and short-term plasticity. Using our newly acquired zap-and-freeze instrument,
combined with cryo-EM tomography, we will test the idea that syt1 mediates activity-dependent SV docking on
short time scales to impact synchronous release, whereas syt7 mediates activity-dependent SV docking on
longer time scales to impact asynchronous release, paired-pulse facilitation, and synaptic depression.
Collectively, the three Aims proposed here will significantly advance our understanding of the functions of three
distinct syt isoforms. In short, we will: 1) address the most elementary questions concerning how the founding
member, syt1, senses Ca2+, 2) conduct a rigorous analysis of syt9 function in striatal neurons and, 3) use
state-of-the-art approaches to time-resolve the roles of syt1 and syt7 in the newly discovered phenomenon of
activity-dependent docking, to—in turn—control elementary aspects of release and plasticity."
10849749,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypofrontality corresponds to a state of reduced frontal cortex activity found in several neuropsychiatric
disorders, including substance use disorders and depression, that correlates with cognition and executive
function disabilities. However, the mechanisms underlying hypofrontality development in response to experience
remain unknown. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are composed of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, are dysregulated
in drug addiction and depression, and have emerged as important regulators of synaptic plasticity in the
developing and mature brain. PNNs formation around parvalbumin-positive fast spiking interneurons (PV+FSIs)
tends to increase PV+FSIs activity, which enhances GABAergic inhibition in neuronal networks and suggests
the potential involvement of PNNs in hypofrontality. Our preliminary data, using a rat model of prefrontal cortex
(PFC) hypofunction (i.e. hypofrontality) induced by chronic methamphetamine (METH) administration, suggest
that chronic METH induces an increase in the percentage of PV+FSIs surrounded by PNNs, associated with an
increase in PV+FSIs excitability, an increase in inhibitory transmission onto pyramidal neurons, as well as the
emergence of cognitive deficits.
The overall objective of this proposal is to study the role of PNNs in METH-induced hypofrontality and cognitive
deficits. The central hypothesis- informed by strong preliminary data and literature- is that METH-induced
increase in PNNs enhances PV+FSIs activity in the PFC and produces hypofrontality and cognitive deficits. Aim
1 will assess when chronic METH self-admnistration initaites changes in PNNs density, expression level and
compostion and whether these changes are long-lasting. Aim 2 will investigate the role of PNNs in METH-
induced cognitive deficits. Aim 3 will assess the role of PNNs in METH-induced hypofrontality.
The proposed research is significant because it will fill fundamental gap in knowledge related to the mechanisms
underlying hypofrontality in METH-addiction. The main conceptual innovation of the proposed study is the
investigation of the link between PNNs and hypofrontality. Furthermore, the knowledge obtained from the
proposed experiments will help to develop effective treatments to ameliorate hypofrontality-related symptoms in
SUD and other psychiatric conditions and can also provide new insights into the basic mechanisms underlying
hypofrontality."
10898833,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The precise assembly of neural circuits ensures accurate neurological function and behavior. For
example, to communicate specific aspects of the visual world to the brain, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) find and
form synaptic contacts with specific postsynaptic partners out of the heterogeneous neuronal population of
retino-recipient areas in the brain. One such area is the superior colliculus (SC), which receives direct retinal
inputs and sends commands for direct innate behaviors such as escape or prey capture. What are the molecular
determinants for selective RGC to SC neuron wiring? How are parallel retinotectal circuits sorted onto different
SC laminae and neuronal relays? How are distinct retinotectal circuits linked to defined visual evoked behaviors?
This proposed study aims to answer these questions in the mouse visual system.
 To accomplish this goal, first, we will map out parallel retinotectal circuits. We have established an
integrated anterograde-tracing and sequencing platform, Trans-Seq, that defines the outputome of a genetically-
defined RGC subtype. We applied Trans-Seq to all RGC subtypes globally, α-RGCs, and On-Off direction-
selective-ganglion-cells and reconstructed their differential outputomes onto superficial superior-collicular (sSC)
neuron subtypes. We propose to apply Trans-Seq to other major RGC subtypes representing different visual
features. The proposed studies will determine retinotectal circuit convergence and divergence at neuron subtype
resolution. Second, we aim to understand cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating specific retinotectal
circuit wiring. We have analyzed α-RGC specific outputomes and revealed a selective sSC neuron subtype,
Nephronectin-positive-wide-field neurons (NPWFs). The α-RGC-to-NPWF circuit was genetically validated using
imaging, electrophysiology, and retrograde tracing. We propose to study how Nephronectin mediates α-RGC
selective axonal lamination onto the deep sSC layer and whether Nephronectin determines the subsequent
synaptic specificity from α-RGCs to NPWFs. We will also investigate what molecular mechanisms mediate
Nephronectin binding and lead to a selective mammalian retinotectal circuit assembly. Third, we will link specific
retinotectal circuits to defined visual evoked behaviors. We propose to combine genetic and optogenetic tools
established above to determine whether the α-RGC-to-NPWF circuit contributes to visual evoked innate
behaviors, such as looming triggered defense responses. We will also examine whether molecular determinants
for connectivity, such as Nephronectin, regulate this behavioral output via these retinotectal circuits.
 Our circuit mapping platform builds a precise connectivity map at neuronal subtype resolution. Further,
this work will align the precise neuronal wiring diagram to innate visual evoked behaviors, informing future
functional and behavioral analysis. The new knowledge gained here may include molecular principles underlying
mammalian circuit wiring relevant beyond the visual system."

Familial Natural Short Sleep (FNSS) is a rare Mendelian form of sleep where affected individuals have a lifelong
requirement for sleep that is significantly less than the average person. These people often sleep 4-6 hours per
night yet report feeling well-rested. In 2009, we reported the first human FNSS trait, identification of the causative
gene/mutation. and characterization of a similarly short sleep phenotype in modeled mice (and a corresponding
rest-activity phenotype in Drosophila). We have since identified over 90 FNSS probands and have been
expanding these families with phenotyping and DNA banking of additional affected and unaffected family
members. Subsequent whole exome sequencing (WES) identified 2 candidate genes/mutations (1 in each of 2
families). In both cases, we've generated mouse models of the human mutations. Both of these mice also show
short sleep phenotype as seen in human subjects. Another gene (GRM1) was found to harbor distinct mutations
in 2 different families. A mouse model of one GRM1 allele also shows short sleep by EEG. These 4 genes
(DEC2, ADRB1, NPSR1, and GRM1) still only explain a minority of the ~30 families that underwent initial WES.
In this proposal, we plan to continue collecting FNSS subjects from existing `unexplained' families and to continue
collecting new probands and their families. Our growing database is an incredible resource for identifying
additional FNSS genes/mutations via whole exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing. Studies of this
growing list of FNSS genes will help us and others to better understand pathways and brain circuits that
contribute to sleep regulation and efficiency. Ultimately, understanding of such biological pathways may lead to
novel targets for developing better drugs to improve sleep quality and efficiency."

promising population scientists; 2) implement complementary co-mentorship and individualized development
plans that cut across at least two phases of the translational continuum, with formal and informal didactics to
facilitate the acquisition of core competencies to transition successfully to the next career stage; and 3) evaluate
training efforts at the trainee and program level to ensure a sustainable cancer population science training
program in the Nation’s capital. We are motivated to create this new program by unprecedented growth in our
understanding of molecular events in cancer development and progression and the multilevel influences of the
host and environment on these processes. This new and growing knowledge base has evolved against the
backdrop of an increasingly diverse US population, disparities in cancer risk and receipt of evidence-based
screening and treatment, societal aging patterns, and evolving models of healthcare delivery. Moving the field of
cancer population science forward will require enhancing our ability to translate basic and clinical advances into

10828908,"Neuronal Ca2+ dyshomeostasis has for many years been implicated in Alzheimer's disease
(AD), and increased Ca2+ influx has been shown to have a close link to tau pathology, but this connection has
not been well examined in animal models. A few prior studies have examined Ca2+ signaling in tauopathy
mouse models by two-photon imaging, with variable results, which may relate to different experimental
parameters. We recently reported more pronounced neuronal dysfunction in tauopathy mice by examining
them by two-photon imaging during enhanced neuronal activity. This deficit could be largely corrected with an
acute tau antibody treatment and the benefits were associated with clearance of soluble phospho-tau protein.
Those prior studies were in mice expressing neuronal calcium indicator via an intracerebral AAV infection. For
a better approach, we recently generated a novel mouse cross by breeding a transgenic model that expresses
a calcium indicator in cortical neurons (Tg-Thy-1-GCAMP6) with PS19 tauopathy mice, and show here its
neuronal dysfunction at a young age, supporting its use in this proposal.
 Beside neuronal dysfunction, microglial activation is associated with AD pathogenesis. However, very
little is known about how microglia interact with cells accumulating tau and how they respond to tau-antibody
complexes. While this can be explored to some extent in culture, it is well known that ex vivo microglia behave
very differently from in vivo. By crossing mice expressing GFP or dTomato in microglia with PS19 tauopathy
mice, we can for the first time visualize structural dynamics of microglia during tau pathology progression and
monitor in real time microglia-mediated phagocytic clearance of tau-antibody complexes.
 Regarding diagnostic imaging, small molecule PET ligands can image tau lesions in vivo but because
these probes are all β-sheet binders, they can recognize various amyloid aggregates. In contrast, whole
antibodies are very specific for their target protein but too large to enter the brain in sufficient quantities for PET
detection. However, single domain antibodies (sdAbs) retain this specificity while being less than 1/10 the size
of whole antibodies, and therefore get into the brain in much larger quantities.
 To address these important issues, which are of a very high relevance to tauopathies, including several
ongoing clinical trials on tau antibody therapies, and well supported by preliminary and published data, we
propose the following independent aims: 1) To determine the time course of tau pathology-induced neuronal
dysfunction in vivo in awake novel transgenic mouse cross of established tauopathy and neuronal calcium
indicator lines; 2) To determine if microglial morphology is influenced by tau pathology in awake mice, and how
it responds to therapy with tau antibodies with or without effector function; 3) To examine the interplay between
neuronal dysfunction and microglial response during the progression of tau pathology and its therapeutic
clearance, and; 4) Refinement of the diagnostic imaging potential of sdAbs against the tau protein."

Maldevelopment of the microvasculature in premature neonates plays a major role in complications of
prematurity with life-long consequences such as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), necrotizing enterocolitis
(NEC) and pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) complicating bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which are major
causes of morbidity and mortality in premature infants. Unfortunately, there is no non-invasive method
established to assess and monitor systemic microvascular development in premature babies to predict which
infant will develop these complications. Nailfold capillaroscopy is a non-invasive technique useful in adults and
children with connective tissue diseases to predict relapses, but not currently used in premature neonates to
assess capillary development. Our preliminary data suggest that, in very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants,
nailbed capillary network density parameters (e.g. capillary skeletal length per area and branch points per
area) significantly decrease during the first month of life. Our data also suggest that babies who ultimately
developed ROP had a higher capillary density in the first few weeks after birth compared to those who do not.
In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that nailfold capillaroscopy can non-invasively detect capillary
development impairment in premature infants and predict development of ROP requiring medical intervention.
Therefore, we will address the following specific aims: 1) Identify the longitudinal developmental changes of nailfold
capillaries in premature infants; 2) define capillary nailfold parameters that most reliably predict moderate to
severe ROP development in VLBW infants. We have established a multi-disciplinary research team which
includes the Northwestern University (NU) Imaging Core, the NU school of engineering and the departments of
Ophthalmology and Neonatology at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. If successful, the
scientific premise of this project would include: 1) To non-invasively identify infants with vascular growth
impairment which could benefit from novel therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing microvascular
complications of prematurity, including ROP, thus improving patient outcomes; 2) To monitor the systemic effect
of therapies targeting the microvasculature e.g. anti-VEGF antibodies. For this proof-of-principle study, we will
focus on prediction of moderate to severe ROP as its diagnosis is directly based on the extent of retinal capillary
maldevelopment. However, we plan in the future to expand our study to other microvascular beds that are less
accessible to exam and to determine whether abnormal nailfold capillary development is able to predict other
complications of prematurity e.g. NEC, BPD-related PHTN."

My Outstanding Investigator Award (OIA) research plan will build on themes developed during my more than
three decades of RAS research, pursuing directions generally ignored by the RAS field and by the NCI RAS
Initiative, to make “undruggable” RAS druggable. I was a member of the research team that made the initial
identification of activated RAS oncogenes in human cancers. Since that discovery, my research has centered
on understanding the basic biochemistry, signaling and biology of RAS proteins, with the long-term goal of
utilizing that information for the development of anti-RAS cancer therapies. My research focuses on pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a cancer where effective targeted therapies remain to be found. With a 95%
KRAS mutation frequency and with substantial experimental evidence that “correcting” the KRAS defect will
significantly impair PDAC growth, PDAC is arguably the most RAS-addicted cancer. The OIA supports
research that “take[s] greater risks, [is] more adventurous”. Based on our unpublished findings from studies
initiated 3-4 years ago and just now coming into fruition, I have identified four new high risk / high reward
research directions. First, despite the well-established interdependency between the RAS and MYC
oncogenes in driving cancer growth, targeting MYC as an anti-KRAS strategy is not widely considered. Our
MYC degradation screen identified novel protein kinases that regulate MYC protein stability; we will exploit
these to cause MYC loss. Second, we have found that the ERK protein kinases are largely responsible for
KRAS-dependent metabolic perturbations (autophagy, glycolysis, macropinocytosis, mitochondrial function).
We suggest that targeting ERK, rather than the metabolic enzymes considered by the field, will be a more
effective therapeutic strategy to target cancer metabolism. We will pursue an issue still largely neglected, the
determination of the key ERK substrates that are critical for ERK-dependent KRAS-mutant PDAC growth.
Third, as with other targeted therapies, anti-KRAS therapies will be limited by mechanisms of acquired
resistance. While much of the field is focused on YAP1, it is also clear that YAP1-independent mechanisms will
also play significant role in how cancers escape KRAS-dependency. We will apply experimental approaches
not previously utilized to define these YAP1–independent mechanisms. These findings will be critical for
development of anti-KRAS therapies that can achieve long-lasting clinical efficacy. Finally, our surprising
finding that one KRAS mutant (G12R) cannot utilize a key RAS effector, PI3K, and drives metabolic activities
distinct from the most prevalent KRAS mutations, provides our rationale to pursue outlier mutations in PDAC,
to identify mutation-specific vulnerabilities as the basis for development of mutation-selective therapies. In
summary, since adherence to long-held dogma has at times stifled progress, less mainstream directions must
be taken if we are to finally achieve the breakthroughs needed for development of effective anti-RAS therapies."

The HIV epidemic in the United States remains a critical public health concern, particularly for multiply
marginalized populations such as Black men who have sex with men (Black MSM) and Black trans women. In
the U.S., MSM experience a disproportionate burden of HIV infection, accounting for over two-thirds of new
cases. There is a profound need to design and test biobehavioral HIV prevention interventions for MSM and
trans women, particularly those who are Black, using intersectional approaches. Given the high burden of
intersectional stigma reported by Black MSM and trans women and its negative effects on HIV-related
healthcare uptake, biobehavioral HIV prevention for Black MSM and trans women will require an intersectional
stigma framework, specific to their interfacing with healthcare settings, to be optimally effective. Challenges
associated with the creation and uptake of combination prevention responses will certainly not be overcome
unless we continue to invest in the training of new generations of scholars who are committed to ending the
epidemic among MSM. This application requests support for the five-year continuation of our NIMH-funded
institutional training grant, “A Training Program to Address HIV-related Health Disparities in MSM”. This
training program has been designed with the goal of providing trainees with the necessary skill sets to not only
launch their careers, but also to make a substantial difference in the fight against HIV/AIDS among MSM. This
program is grounded within a leading School of Public Health, a research environment that is not only rich in
terms of HIV prevention research but also has a strong tradition in LGBT health research, with robust
theoretical and empirical approaches to explaining risk among MSM and a strong focus in HIV global health
and bio-behavioral research. This creates an ideal environment to train the next generation of HIV prevention
scientists who will address the epidemic among MSM. Continuation of a T32 training program within this
extraordinarily rich environment will continue a mechanism to mentor the next generation of HIV prevention
scientists who will be uniquely poised to find ways to end the epidemic among MSM."
10911200,"Neuroendocrine tumors arise in multiple tissues, including the skin, lung, prostate, and pancreas, and share
common neural and endocrine phenotypes. Discovering their mechanism of carcinogenesis is challenging due
to our inability to directly observe tumor formation, as well as the mutational heterogeneity of established tumors.
Unlike tumors that arise through random mutational processes, Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a
neuroendocrine skin cancer that can be caused by infection with Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) and whose
mechanisms can be studied in vitro. MCPyV contains two oncogenes, the small T (ST) and large T (LT) antigens.
The impact of ST on cell migration and LT on the cell cycle are known, but there is no genome-wide, quantitative
understanding of how ST and LT reprogram normal cells into a neuroendocrine tumor prone to metastasis. Our
preliminary RNA-sequencing data from normal cells expressing MCPyV oncogenes indicates that LT
transcriptionally alters invasion and migration-related pathways such as WNT and TGF-beta signaling, in a
manner that is similar to expression changes in human MCC tumors and metastases. Using this system, we can
also measure gene expression dynamics and directly observe the temporal sequence of molecular events
underlying carcinogenesis in a way that cannot be achieved through static tumor measurements alone. The viral
etiology of MCC therefore provides us with a unique opportunity to systematically investigate and quantify the
regulatory circuits driving neuroendocrine tumor formation and metastasis. In Aim 1, we will reconstruct the host
transcriptional networks and signaling pathways utilized by MCPyV to promote cell motility and invasion,
determine the roles of LT, WNT, and TGF-beta in promoting metastasis, and predict the optimal strategy for
inhibiting these mechanisms. In collaboration with metastasis experts at the University of Arizona, we will test
our predictions in a series of MCC model systems, including cell-based migration and invasion assays and
mouse xenograft studies. In Aim 2, we will measure protein dynamics of neural regulators activated by ST and
LT and integrate them with gene expression and ATAC-seq data to build a network model of the cell fate
transition induced by MCPyV. Our work will provide a systems-level analysis of regulatory circuits underlying
metastasis and cellular reprograming in neuroendocrine tumors, and will identify new therapies for Merkel cell
carcinoma that may be applicable to other tumor types."

Dr. Benyam Muluneh’s long-term career goal is to become a leading clinician-researcher in oncology by leveraging health
behavior theories and implementation science methods to promote adherence, access, and equitable cancer care. This K08
Mentored Research Career Development award (PAR-21-299) is an initial step toward developing his research program as
an NIH-funded independent investigator; with this award, he will follow a structured plan, receive expert mentorship, and
conduct research in an ideal environment. Oral anticancer (OAC) agents revolutionized treatment of once-fatal
malignancies by extending survival and delaying progression; however, success often requires a medication adherence
rate >90%. Medication adherence drops from >80-90% in clinical trials (where patients receive adherence support,
proactive symptom management, and the study drug is provided free of charge) to ~40% in clinical practice,
compromising clinical outcomes. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) recommends cancer centers design and implement
health promotion programs (e.g. adherence interventions) guided by health behavior theories, models, and frameworks.
Most published adherence interventions lack NCI’s theory-guided approach: they address known barriers (eg. patient
education and symptom management) without addressing critical moderators of health behavior (eg. social support, self-
efficacy), compromising effectiveness and long-term sustainability. Additionally, many of the existing interventions were
piloted in well-resourced academic medical centers and were not adapted to rural and underserved settings. Our team
piloted an adherence coaching intervention—consisting of tailored education and barrier mitigation—which increased
adherence rates from 48% to 60% in chronic leukemia patients; however, similar to other adherence programs designed
by clinicians, our intervention was not optimally effective (adherence <90%) or sustainable beyond the pilot phase. The
objective of this proposed study is to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of our adherence coaching intervention
in both urban/academic and rural setting, by integrating social cognitive theory (SCT)—a proven behavioral theory that
conceptualizes health behavior through cognitive, environmental, and behavioral influences —with a well-tested planning
framework called intervention mapping (IM). We will identify cognitive, behavioral, and environmental determinants of
adherence to OACs in both academic/urban and rural settings (aim 1); conduct focus group discussions to adapt our
adherence coaching intervention for local contexts (aim 2); and test the refined adherence coaching intervention in a Type
I Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation study (aim 3). Through the following training objectives, Dr. Muluneh will
acquire the skills to complete the research aims: gain training and experience in intervention design using health behavior
theories (objective 1); gain training and experience designing effectiveness-implementation studies (objective 2); prepare
and submit an R01 grant based on findings from the proposed K08 award (objective 3); and gain professional
development skills necessary for a successful faculty career (objective 4). This foundational knowledge is necessary to
implement and widely disseminate interventions to improve medication adherence in oncology clinical settings."
10854910,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 2 million Americans suffer from Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and another 9 million misuse opioids.
Treatments for opioid addiction exist, but effectiveness is compromised when subjects use illicit opiates during
treatment. Reuse rates during treatment can be high, and reducing illicit opiate use during treatment has thus
recently become a major NIDA policy goal. Elevated reuse rates not only compromise treatment effectiveness,
but this behavior predicts, and likely drives, treatment dropout. With the support of a NIDA basic science R01,
we developed a set of easy-to-use instruments that predict opioid reuse events with about twice the accuracy of
any existing tool. The 5-minute battery we developed indicates the numerical probability that a patient will reuse
illicit opiates within the next 7-10 days. In a pilot cohort, we successfully migrated this battery to a commercial
smartphone platform, and demonstrated 100% retention and >85% compliance (median compliance > 95%) over
a use period of up to 4 months. In a survey of our largely homeless MOUD patients we found that 85% already
had smartphones and data contracts appropriate for using this platform as a part of their treatment. In a survey
of OUD treatment physicians, we found that our system and the reuse prediction it provides, was both highly
desirable and usable as implemented. Finally, we found in a reanalysis of data from CTN-0051 that dynamic
dosing of this very kind reduces relapse rates. Our primary goal in this mid-scale clinical trial is to test the
hypothesis that clinicians who use the output of our mobile system to adjust buprenorphine and methadone
dosing achieve lower opiate reuse rates than physicians who provide care-as-usual. Our secondary goal is to
examine the usability and desirability of this solution for clinicians with an eye to usability and large-scale
deployment. Our third and final goal is to measure the cost-effectiveness of this solution from multiple
perspectives. If we are successful it will be possible to employ an algorithmic and measurement-based approach
to OUD treatment with methadone and buprenorphine which reduces reuse rates and relapse rates amongst
OUD patients."

Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a slowly progressing, untreatable neurodegenerative disorder that
affects a substantial fraction of the aging population today. Hundreds of clinical trials and massive investments
into drug development efforts have so far not resulted in a single disease-modifying therapy that showed a
significant beneficial effect on the disease. Drug repositioning, the application of approved drugs in a novel
disease context, has gained increasing attention as a promising alternative to identify treatment options for AD.
For successful pharmaceutical intervention in AD, a drug or drug combination needs to target the complex
molecular changes observed in AD in a specific manner. To identify drugs exerting these desired effects a
detailed understanding of the molecular networks across regulatory layers that underly the biological system is
required. However, these networks are not readily available and are scattered across hundreds of studies and
complex databases. To address this challenge, we propose TargetAD, a network-based framework that builds
this molecular network from genetic associations, co-expression/correlation networks, metabolic pathways,
gene regulation data, protein-protein interactions, and tissue-specific gene and protein expression data
augmented with AD multi-omics associations, as well as drug-drug target data and molecular drug signatures.
We will achieve this by leveraging the power of large-scale, multi-omics association results generated within
NIH's large “Accelerating Medicines Partnership - Alzheimer's Disease” initiative and other large-scale
population-based studies. The collective evidence will be stored in a publicly accessible graph database, which
we then use for the identification of candidate drugs or drug combinations (“candidates”).
Through the development of a novel network-based machine-learning method, we will rank candidates in the
database by their probability to affect AD networks in a beneficial way. High-ranking candidates will be
subjected to a comprehensive prioritization pipeline. To this end, we will retrospectively investigate whether
longitudinal AD-related biomarker profiles of individuals who took a repositioning candidate show evidence for
healthier aging in large studies of AD. These analyses will be complemented by examining whether the post-
mortem neuropathological burden supports a beneficial effect of the candidate. To increase power and
coverage of candidates, we will further analyze electronic health records from the UK Biobank for additional
evidence. The three most promising candidates will be selected in discussion with a panel of experts. These
will be evaluated by preclinical validation studies in animal models of AD.
In summary, the unique combination of multidisciplinary expertise, access to high-profile datasets and
advanced computational integration pipelines will allow us to identify molecular pathways disturbed in AD that
are targetable by drug repositioning candidates, which thus are prime candidates for testing in clinical trials."

A diverse U.S. biomedical research workforce is essential for developing innovation in basic, clinical,
translational research and healthcare and is necessary for improving the nation’s health. Despite decades of
efforts to increase underrepresented racial / ethnic groups and women in science their proportional
representation remains markedly low, especially in academia. The renewal application for the San Diego
IRACDA Scholars Program aims to enhance the successful transition of diverse biomedical scientists into
independent academic careers. San Diego “SD IRACDA” is a mentored postdoctoral career development
training program that provides training in rigorous and reproducible research, teaching training based on
scientific principles and professional skill development. SD IRACDA combines a mentored research-intensive
experience at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and mentored teaching training experience at
San Diego City College and San Diego State University (SDSU), two large undergraduate institutions that
serve diverse student populations. The overarching goal of SD IRACDA is to enhance the transition of diverse
biomedical scientists into independent academic careers, thereby increasing the diversity of academic faculty.
The specific objectives are to: 1) recruit and train a diverse pool of postdoctoral scholars that conduct rigorous
and reproducible research within the scope of the NIGMS-mission, 2) use evidence-based strategies to
enhance career skill development and effective mentorship of postdoctoral scholars, and 3) to provide teaching
training in scientific teaching principles and evidence-based practices. Other objectives are to enhance the
science curriculum at our partner-teaching intensive institutions, and to provide research opportunities for
partner institution faculty and students and role models and mentorship of students, thereby increasing the
number of diverse students participating in research and entering graduate programs in biomedical sciences.
Since its inception in 2003, SD IRACDA has trained 103 scholars, 62% are from underrepresented
backgrounds and 59% are women. Program evaluation has demonstrated that 63% of all SD IRACDA scholars
and 56% of underrepresented scholars have obtained independent faculty positions (94% tenure-track)
including a high percentage at R1 institutions, 32% of all scholars and 34% of underrepresented scholars,
respectively. Of SD IRACDA faculty alumni, 55% have received independent grant awards with the highest
percentage (31%) from the NIH. SD IRACDA scholars publish, obtain academic faculty positions and receive
post-fellowship funding at a greater rate compared to NIH F32-supported postdoctoral fellows at UCSD. SD
IRACDA has further benefitted the partner institutions, San Diego City College and San Diego State University,
by providing new and improved science curriculum, authentic research experiences and critical mentoring for
underrepresented students to enhance academic advancement and train the next generation of scientists."

The inferior colliculus (IC) is the midbrain hub of the central auditory system. Although the IC is a critical
processing center for speech, vocalizations, and other complex sounds, the neuronal mechanisms underlying
computations in the IC remain largely unknown. This gap in knowledge persists because it has proven difficult
to reliably identify specific classes of IC neurons. By combining molecular markers with anatomical and
physiological measures, we recently overcame this obstacle and have identified two novel classes of IC
principal neurons: vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons and neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons. VIP neurons
are excitatory, glutamatergic neurons, while NPY neurons are inhibitory, GABAergic neurons. Both VIP and
NPY neurons are stellate neurons with dendritic arbors that spread across the tonotopic axis of the central
nucleus of the IC (ICc), and both project to multiple brain regions, including the auditory thalamus. Because
they can sample input from a range of sound frequencies, it has long been hypothesized that ICc stellate
neurons play important roles in sound processing, but the functional roles of stellate neurons have previously
been inaccessible. By identifying VIP and NPY neurons, we possess the tools for the first time to selectively
target and manipulate an excitatory and an inhibitory class of ICc stellate neurons. The overall objective of this
proposal is to establish a functional wiring diagram for the inputs and outputs of VIP and NPY neurons and to
determine the differences in how VIP and NPY neurons respond to sounds. To pursue this objective, we will
use viral tract tracing, optogenetic circuit mapping, brain slice electrophysiology, and optogenetically-targeted
in vivo recordings. In Aim 1, we will identify the ascending sources of auditory input to VIP and NPY neurons
and determine how these inputs vary their synaptic strength during trains of activity. In Aim 2, we will identify
the long-range targets and terminal arborization patterns of VIP and NPY neurons and determine how synaptic
transmission from VIP and NPY neurons influences neurons in the auditory thalamus. In Aim 3, we will test the
hypothesis that excitatory VIP neurons and inhibitory NPY neurons differ in their responses to tones and noise
and to amplitude- and frequency-modulated sounds, stimuli that represent important features of speech and
other vocalizations. The expected outcome of this research is that we will determine for the first time how two
classes of ICc stellate neurons, one excitatory and one inhibitory, integrate ascending and descending auditory
input, influence long-range postsynaptic targets, and respond to simple and complex sounds. These results will
generate evidence-based hypotheses about how ICc stellate neurons contribute to sound processing and will
provide a launching point for investigations into the circuit computations that underlie speech and vocalization
coding in the midbrain."

The purpose of this Training Program is to train scientists in Experimental Endocrinology and Metabolism to be
the future leaders of academia, who will generate the new ideas, and of the biopharmaceutical industry, who will
translate these ideas into practical therapies. We strive to enable our Trainees to be capable of performing high
quality biomedical research in clinical or basic areas of Endocrinology and Metabolism. We will provide Trainees
a wide variety of opportunities in both traditional and novel areas of Endocrinology/Metabolism, including but not
limited to: clinical studies of the pathophysiology and therapy of diabetes and obesity; basic studies in
intermediary metabolism and diabetes, lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, immunological mechanisms in
atherogenesis, the role of thyroid metabolism in cardiac metabolism; neuroendocrine control of reproduction;
lipid-mediated cellular signaling pathways; and endocrine and nuclear receptors mediated regulation of cellular
metabolism. The program is centered within the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism of the Department of
Medicine, but includes faculty with relevant interests in other basic and clinical departments of UCSD, as well as
faculty from closely associated Institutions. The 20 Mentors selected to be Faculty include both established
senior faculty who continue from previous cycles, as well as younger faculty who have stellar scientific
credentials, but who will be the future leaders of our Training Program.
The program will include: (1) intensive laboratory and/or clinical research training, (2) laboratory meeting,
seminars and other conferences, (3) formal course instruction and (4) oversight by Mentors and the Executive
Committee. The primary focus is the research undertaken by trainees under close supervision of their Mentor.
The goal is for the trainee to increasingly assume an independent scientific role in their research. Weekly lab
meetings provide opportunities for constructive critique, and frequent seminars provide opportunities for
intellectual growth. Trainees participate in weekly Endocrine Grand Rounds and other Division activities as
appropriate, such as Journal Clubs, where admixtures of basic and clinical science are discussed. This provides
cross-exchanges that have proven to be highly stimulating and even led to productive research collaborations.
Trainees take 3-4 quarters of formal course work, depending on background, including a required course entitled
“Biomedical Research Ethics.” All Postdoctoral Trainees at UCSD develop and complete a five-year “IDP”
(Individual Development Plan), which is monitored by the Mentor and the Executive Committee of the Training
Program, which will meet annually with each Trainee to both review the Trainee’s progress according to the IDP,
as well as to provide advice and/or assistance to ensure that the Trainee’s overall career goals are met. Thus,
this training program expands and brings together various activities encompassing the training and education of
postdoctoral fellows in the fields of Endocrinology and Metabolism."

Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial/ethnic group in the United States (US), and Asians of Chinese
origin represent the largest single US Asian subgroup. Among Chinese Americans, the majority (62%) are
foreign-born. Although Chinese immigrants report better health than their US-born counterparts, this health ad-
vantage decreases over time with increasing duration of residence. The downward health trajectory has been
primarily attributed to behavioral acculturation, but immigration also encompasses extensive stress and social
isolation. Social isolation, in turn, may increase chronic disease risk through dysregulation in multiple systems –
neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, metabolic, inflammatory, immune – which together are indicative of allostatic
load (AL). Indeed, studies of other US immigrant populations (mostly African or Latinx) have noted that longer
US residence is associated with higher AL. Despite these findings, the question of whether immigrants’ experi-
ences of social isolation affect disease risk and health has not been well studied. Social connectedness, or the
extent to which one perceives oneself to be closely and meaningfully connected with other individuals, groups,
and society as a whole, is a possible strategy to address social isolation, but the conditions and contexts that
foster social connectedness are not well understood. Living in ethnic enclaves (i.e. neighborhoods with a greater
proportion of people of the same ethnicity) may have positive effects among Chinese immigrants including
greater social support and less loneliness. It has been suggested that enclaves provide the necessary structural
conditions – namely, physical and social spaces – for social connectedness to develop, although this has yet to
be confirmed in large-scale studies. Thus, we propose a comprehensive investigation of the following interrelated
questions: Do post-migration experiences of social isolation/connectedness have biologic correlates among
foreign-born Chinese? And do ethnic enclaves contribute to social connectedness in this population; if so, how?
To address these questions, we will recruit a cohort of 600 foreign-born Chinese across the Philadelphia region,
including residents of ethnic enclaves as well as residents of neighborhoods lacking the co-ethnic density and
resources of recognized enclaves. Specific aims are to: (1) Examine associations of social connectedness and
social isolation with AL in a cohort of US Chinese immigrants; and (2) Explore whether and how enclave resi-
dence and engagement with enclave-based resources are associated with social connectedness. Data collection
will include questionnaires (e.g., social connectedness, isolation, engagement with enclave resources), blood
pressure, anthropometry, and fasting blood samples analyzed for markers of AL. Addresses of residences and
locations of activities (e.g., shopping, religious services) will be geocoded. Longitudinal assessments will be
obtained at 2-year follow-up to identify changes in markers of AL and correlates of changes in those measures.
Project findings will identify the most vulnerable individuals and neighborhoods to target for outreach and pinpoint
the critical community-level resources for promoting positive health trajectories in this immigrant population."

This is a resubmission of a new application from the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and
Surgeons for a postdoctoral training program in autoimmune rheumatic diseases. The program’s mission is to
train promising young rheumatologists and early career PhD investigators in the methodologies and
approaches needed for scientific careers in Molecular and Translational Rheumatology. Autoimmune
rheumatic diseases (ARDs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, and incidence rates appear to be
rising. Yet at the same time there has been a substantial and progressive decline in the number of
rheumatologists choosing physician-scientist careers. Accordingly, this new T32 application will address this
need by identifying highly qualified candidates for academic rheumatology careers and creating an innovative
training environment that fills these needs and that builds on the considerable strengths of this research
University. The proposed training is focused around three major themes, each reflecting a phase of the ARDs:
1) genetic predisposition and mechanisms; 2) pre-clinical autoimmunity; and 3) progression to clinical disease.
We have engaged a superb set of primary mentors in Rheumatology and secondary mentors outside
Rheumatology, many already active collaborators, who span multiple Departments and Centers and who
encompass all three research themes. All of the mentors are well funded, the vast majority with NIH funding
and have track records of successfully mentoring trainees to independent careers in investigation.
The training period is two years in duration. Trainees will consist of Rheumatology postdoctoral fellows, as
well as PhD and MD-PhD postdoctoral fellows who are committed to research in the ARDs. Funding is
requested for one slot in Year 1, increasing to two slots in Years 2 and 3, and advancing to 3 slots in years 4
and 5. The training program consists of one-on-one training by the Mentor, as well as required lectures and
coursework, and including optional degree coursework. A major focus of training will be on learning to bridge
computational science with the biology of rheumatic diseases.
This program will prepare the next generation of investigators in molecular and translational rheumatology
research who will ultimately make significant contributions to our nation’s public health as independent
investigators."
10795915,"This R01 application focuses on the underlying mechanisms of neurovascular coupling dysfunction. The brain
consumes a large amount of energy which must be supplied as oxygen and glucose by blood flow. Neurovascular
coupling, a mechanism that matches local neuronal activity to blood flow, is critical to maintain local
microenvironment and normal brain function. However, normal neurovascular coupling is disrupted in seizure,
traumatic brain injury, and other neurological disorders. Despite continued high neuronal metabolism, small
cerebral arteries and arterioles begin to inappropriately constrict to limit CBF to the challenged neurons. This
pathogenic vasoconstriction, termed the “inverse hemodynamic response” (IHR), is thought to contribute to
brain damage and functional impairment in these neurological diseases. The mechanism of IHR is unknown.
This proposal seeks to test a novel hypothesis that seizure-induced IHR is mediated by an endothelial signaling
pathway consisted of Neuropeptide Y Receptor 1 (NPYR1), Transient Receptor Potential (Canonical) 3 (TRPC3)
channels, and endothelin 1 (ET1). We generated inducible and brain-specific endothelial TRPC3 knockout line
and NPYR1 knockout line. These novel mouse lines will be used in combination with NPYR1, TRPC3 and ET1
receptor selective inhibitors to test our hypothesis. Aim 1 will demonstrate the existence of an endothelial
NPYR1-TRPC3-ET1 signaling pathway that mediates cerebral vasoconstriction using acutely isolated brain
parenchymal arterioles and cranial window preparations in vivo. Aim 2 will show that the same signaling
pathway mediates seizure-induced IHR. Aim 3 will determine whether disruption of this signaling pathway will
reduce susceptibility to seizures and their deleterious consequences. The studies rely on complementary areas
of expertise pooled by a research team with expertise in cerebrovascular reactivity, epilepsy and
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Collectively, these experiments will reveal new mechanistic
insights regarding IHR and may lead to new treatments for epilepsy and other neurological diseases."
10923830,"Background: Over the past decade, VA has implemented opioid policies, most notably the 2013 Opioid Safety
Initiative, designed to address the burgeoning opioid crisis. As the pendulum has swung away from opioid
prescribing, it is possible that some patients with serious illness may have experienced unintended
consequences, including uncontrolled pain, even while others may have avoided potential complications of
opioid use. This project examines the potential impact of these policies on Veterans with end-stage renal
disease (ESRD), a population of approximately 35,000 Veterans for whom balancing the benefits and harms of
opioids may be particularly challenging. These Veterans have very limited life expectancy and a substantial
pain burden, comparable to Veterans with metastatic cancer, but often under-appreciated. They are at
increased risk of opioid-related serious adverse events (SAE; e.g. opioid overdose). Yet compared with other
seriously-ill populations, they have fewer non-opioid analgesic alternatives to fall back on and may face
barriers to non-pharmacologic pain management strategies. Moreover, most Veterans with ESRD receive
dialysis in the community either under VA Community Care or Medicare, exposing them to the potential
adverse impact of care fragmentation on opioid safety and pain control.
Significance/Impact: Understanding the impact of VA initiatives to improve opioid safety at the population
level on Veterans with serious illness is critical to the VA’s commitment to ensure that these vulnerable
Veterans are provided care that relieves distressing symptoms. The work proposed here is responsive to the
VA Under Secretary for Health’s priority to improve pain management and the safety of pain medications.
Innovation: The proposed study is the first to examine the impact of opioid safety initiatives and prescribing
guidelines on a group of seriously-ill Veterans. It leverages VA data that include rich measures of pain control
unavailable from any other national data source. The use of a sequential explanatory mixed-methods study
design to triangulate quantitative and qualitative findings on pain management in the context of contemporary
opioid policy is a novel contribution to the field of opioid research.
Specific Aims: 1) Examine changes in pain management strategies, opioid-related SAE, and pain control
among Veterans with ESRD from 2010-2018; 2) Compare changes in opioid-related SAE by setting of dialysis
(VA, VA-Community Care, Medicare) from 2010-2018; 3) Elicit the perspectives and experiences of Veterans
with ESRD and the clinicians who care for them related to pain management in the context of VA opioid safety
initiatives in order to inform policy and practice.
Methodology: The study employs a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design. The quantitative portion of
the study (Aims 1 and 2) includes Veterans on dialysis across all VAs between 2010 and 2018. We will
conduct an interrupted time series analysis of linked VA, Medicare, and USRDS data to examine whether
Veterans with ESRD have had changes in pain therapies (opioids, non-opioids, non-pharmacologic), opioid-
related serious adverse, and pain, overall and by setting of dialysis, over time since the 2013 OSI. We will then
conduct semi-structured interviews with Veterans with ESRD and VA clinicians who care for ESRD patients to
identify opportunities for improvement in VA pain management policy and practice (Aim 3).
Implementation/Next Steps: We will work with our Advisory Board of operational partners, to ensure that our
research will inform policy about how to optimally align opioid safety initiatives and pain management
guidelines to meet the needs of Veterans with ESRD and those with other serious illnesses. We will collaborate
with the Board to develop a ‘roadmap” that will summarize our key findings, identify implications for policy and
clinical care, and identify priorities for future clinical and policy intervention intended to optimize pain control for
Veterans with ESRD. This roadmap can likely be adapted for other groups of seriously-ill Veterans."

patients with low grade disease receive premature or excessive treatment, which can lead to decades of
incontinence and erectile dysfunction. One reason for the simultaneous over- and under- diagnosis of prostate
cancer is that current imaging methods are unreliable, which in turn make biopsies unreliable. A noninvasive
imaging method with good sensitivity and specificity is one of the greatest needs in prostate cancer
management, and diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) is the most promising candidate. However, prostate MRI has
extremely low image quality due to the long echo times needed for adequate diffusion encoding.
To improve DWI of prostate, we introduce a new concept in MRI hardware: an accessory whose sole purpose
is to provide diffusion encoding to a target organ. Unlike imaging gradients which are volume-encompassing
and stringently linear, this “inside-out” diffusion gradient is a wand placed between the upper legs which
creates strong nonlinear fields at the prostate. The geometry allows for standard spatial encoding, standard
receiver placement, and portability between scanners.
For prostate imaging, this approach achieves a gradient that is >10-fold stronger over the region of interest,
increasing both overall SNR and sensitivity to epithelial/cellular volume, a hallmark of malignancy. The
increase in field strength is predicted to double contrast in DWI of prostate, improving active surveillance,
biopsy hit rates, and treatment monitoring. Taken together, the preliminary data on (1) achievable hardware
specs, (2) prostate imaging simulations, and (3) phantom experimental results make a strong case for the
feasibility of this project and the significant impact it will have on prostate DWI.
Approach:
Aim 1 will install and characterize a custom diffusion gradient to demonstrate DWI in a prostate lesion phantom
which is consistent with conventional methods, but with higher reproducibility and CNR.
Aim 2 applies the new method to prostate of healthy controls to establish positioning, PNS thresholds,
accuracy, and improved image quality (precision, contrast, reproducibility and qualitative ratings) in vivo.
Aim 3 will image patients with biopsy-naïve suspected lesions, which will be outlined and scored by multiple
radiologists to quantify contrast, diagnostic confidence and inter-reader variability in a realistic population.
Aim 4 will acquire, in radical prostatectomy patients, coregistered presurgical in vivo MRI, ex vivo MRI of the
excised prostate, and whole-mount pathology to show correlation between ADC and true Gleason score.
Together, these aims will provide strong evidence for the increased precision, contrast, diagnostic confidence,
and clinical validity of DWI acquired with this hardware."

The goal of this project is to comprehensively examine, at single-neuron resolution, the flow of
information through the brain during a decision-making task. Leveraging the expertise,
knowledge, and data gained from International Brain Laboratory members who have designed
and studied this task, the proposed approach combines novel, advanced techniques for high-
throughput, high-resolution physiological recordings and anatomical tracing to determine the
substrates of inter-regional communication. In light of the extensive functional and structural
diversity of neurons in the brain (for example, neurons in the auditory cortex can project to at least
11 different targets, forming 264 distinct projection patterns), the proposed experiments test the
central hypothesis that specific privileged subpopulations mediate the flow of information between
regions in a state-dependent manner. Such subpopulations will be identified based on
transcriptionally defined cell subtypes (Aim 1) and projection types or motifs (Aim 2). In vivo two-
photon calcium imaging will be combined with in vitro profiling of transcriptional and anatomical
identity via the novel barcoded anatomy resolved by sequencing (BARseq) technique. BARseq is
used to identify the projections and/or genetic markers of thousands or tens of thousands of
neurons simultaneously in a single animal. Because the two techniques are both based on
imaging, the in vivo data will be registered with in vitro data to support structure-function, state-
dependent insights at the single-neuron level. The regions and circuits targeted in these
experiments will be informed by the results of Projects 1 and 2. In turn, the results generated here
in Project 5 will inform the modeling work proposed in Project 3."

 Ebola (EBOV) and Marburg (MARV) filoviruses cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans with
up to 90% mortality rates. Their genome contains only seven genes including the viral matrix protein
VP40 which, when expressed in mammalian cells, is sufficient to produce virus-like particles (VLPs)
that are essentially indistinguishable from live virions. VP40 forms dimers, hexamers and octamers
mediated by different protein-protein (PPI) and protein-lipid (PLI) interactions that fulfill different and
essential roles in the viral lifecycle, making VP40 a “swiss army knife” of proteins. The fascinating
dynamic equilibria of VP40 and the availability of VLPs as a model system for direct observations
outside of a BSL4 laboratory make VP40 a unique system to rigorously study the biophysical basis for
viral budding as well as PPIs and PLIs in general. The significance of these studies is further increased
because VP40 is the most conserved protein upon virus passage through humans, but exploiting VP40
as a potential drug target is unlikely to succeed without understanding the physical basis for
oligomerization and function of VP40.
 The Stahelin and Wiest laboratories, building on established collaborations with each other and
several other collaborators supplying specific expertise, will use computational, experimental and
structural biophysics methods to investigate the central hypothesis of this grant: that interdomain
interactions of VP40 are key regulators of VP40 structures during the viral life cycle. In two specific
aims, we will (i) Determine the biophysical mechanisms by which VP40 dimer, hexamer and octamers
form in silico, in vitro and in human cells and (ii) determine how mutations of VP40 that arise in humans
during the course of an outbreak as well as in animals during passage of virus contribute to VP40
conformational change and rearrangement into its separate oligomeric forms.
 These questions will be studied using a tightly integrated approach using multiscale molecular
dynamics simulations on the µs timescale and free energy perturbation methods on the computational
side and hydrogen-deuterium exchange, cellular imaging of VLPs as well as more traditional
biophysical experiments such as ultracentrifugation and SPR to determine the binding constants of
wildtype VP40 from EBOV and MARV as well as pertinent mutants. This innovate and integrated
approach will not only provide careful validation of the results, but also provide detailed insights into the
PPIs and PLIs governing the oligomerization equilibria across many time- and lengths scale, thus
enabling a rigorous understanding of the biophysical principles for a biomedically very important
filovirus protein that will have a significant impact on understanding other PPIs and PLIs."
10812454,"Project Summary/Abstract
Nuclear paraspeckles function to regulate mRNA translation. mRNAs that are sequestered in paraspeckles are
translationally silent while those not entering paraspeckles can translocate from the nucleus where the can
effectively be translated. There is now accumulating evidence that paraspeckles are increased in number and
size in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have a central role in neurodegenerative
disease, but their functions in paraspeckles are not well understood, yet we confirmed a critical regulatory role
of paraspeckles mediated by the stress-related RBP STAU1. In supporting studies, we discovered that STAU1
is overabundant in multiple neurodegenerative diseases including AD, FTD, and ALS, and that by normalizing
STAU1 various molecular and motor phenotypes relevant to these diseases are improved or restored. Relevant
to paraspeckles, STAU1 competes for mRNA binding at inverted repeat Alu sequences (IRAlus) with the
paraspeckle core protein p54nrb and directs mRNA translocation to the cytoplasm, for active translation. The
long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) NEAT1 is indispensable for paraspeckle formation, involving p54nrb interaction. In
our preliminary studies we found that NEAT1 is strikingly downregulated in cells depleted of STAU1. NEAT1
also interacts with TDP-43 and is overabundant in AD, FTD, and ALS. Since both NEAT1 and STAU1 are
overabundant in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, we hypothesize that normalization of STAU1 abundance
will restore NEAT1 to normal levels, thereby restoring paraspeckle function. STAU1 will likely be a better
therapeutic target than NEAT1 itself, because mice null for Neat1 have reduced cardiac function while mice null
for Stau1 are viable and are characterized by no neurodegeneration. Our proposal is divided into two specific
aims. The first aim will determine NEAT1 levels and paraspeckle localization as well as paraspeckle sizes and
numbers in cell models that have been edited to express mutant ATXN2, that interacts with STAU1 in
cytoplasmic phase-separated liquid droplets characterized by overabundant STAU1. We also evaluate Neat1
abundance and localization in a mouse model that we developed that overexpresses STAU1. In the second aim
we characterize paraspeckles and NEAT1 in cultured human cortical neurons, with focus on TDP-43 pathology.
The successful demonstration that NEAT1 is altered in diseases characterized by STAU1 overabundance will
lead to new potential therapeutic targets for AD, FTD, ALS and other disorders with abnormal nuclear
paraspeckle function, deeper understanding on the significance of NEAT1 and STAU1 to neurodegenerative
disease, and will further support STAU1 as a therapeutic target."
10792916,"Dental resin composites have been widely used clinically due to their bonding potential to the tooth tissues, good
mechanical properties, and lower cost compared to other indirect restorations. While successful, long-term
survival of a restoration can be compromised by secondary caries at the tooth-composite margins. In most cases,
failure is due to the microleakage of bacteria and their acid by-products through the margins between composite
and tooth structures. Once biofilms are established on a surface, it is extremely difficult to remove or kill
pathogenic bacteria therein. Therefore, inhibition of microbial adhesion or inactivation of the adhered bacteria
could impair their development into biofilms. The goal of this application is to create a novel dental composite
that inhibits biofilm accumulation as well as dislodging surface-adhered microbes on restorative materials using
enhanced electric potential at the interface generated by oral motion without relying on microbial killing activity.
A nanocomposite platform based on barium titanate (BaTiO3) nanoparticles enables antibiofilm and self-powering
functionalities for biomedical applications. This nanocomposite surface inhibits bacterial colonization by utilizing
its intrinsic physicochemical properties without bactericidal activity, thereby minimizing the induction of
antimicrobial resistance and destruction of homeostasis microbiota. In addition, the piezoelectric property of
BaTiO3 nanoparticles that converts normal oral motions into electrical energy can be utilized to enhance its
antibiofilm activity. Ongoing studies indicate that antibiofilm activity can be further enhanced by modulating the
work function by introducing a shallow metallic surface (< 100 Å) on the nanocomposite, exhibiting almost
complete inhibition of bacterial colonization. Based on this exciting supporting data, we hypothesize that force-
powering of piezoelectric crystals to produce enhanced electric potential combined with bacterial anti-adhesive
property creates an anti-infectious environment that prevents the development of biofilms on restorations and
secondary caries. We anticipate that the creation of this anti-infectious smart biomaterial would increase the
functionality of restorations and provide a new strategy to prevent secondary caries as well as reduce the risk of
restoration failure."

 Cryptococcus neoformans is a pathogenic fungus, accounting for 181,000 deaths each year, worldwide.
After inhalation of C. neoformans, the fungus grows in the lung; if the fungal growth is not controlled in the lung,
the fungus can migrate to the central nervous system, causing fatal meningoencephalitis, particularly in immune
compromised individuals including HIV/AIDS patients. Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is a leading cause of
HIV/AIDS patients. To cause meningoencephalitis, C. neoformans must invade the brain across the blood-brain
barrier and replicate in the brain parenchyma. However, after entering the brain, these invading fungal cells will
encounter brain resident macrophages as well as recruited inflammatory monocytes and their derivatives. The
outcome of the interactions between C. neoformans and these mononuclear phagocytes will determine the
progression of the disease. Thus, the mechanism behind the interactions of C. neoformans with these
mononuclear phagocytes is fundamental for understanding cryptococcal pathogenesis. So far, little is known
about the interactions between C. neoformans and mononuclear phagocytes in the brain parenchyma after its
crossing the blood-brain barrier. Based on our compelling preliminary data, we hypothesize that C. neoformans
evolved strategies to escape from host defense and that mononuclear phagocytes orchestrate fungal
pathogenesis as well as clearance. By employing genetically engineered C. neoformans strains and their
reconstitute strains as well as genetically engineered animals, we will characterize the complex interactions of
invading C. neoformans with mononuclear phagocytes and determine how the fungus escapes from host
defense in the brain in vivo. If successful, these studies would reveal novel insights into mechanisms of fungal
pathogenesis and host-pathogen interactions, providing scientific basis for targeting mononuclear phagocytes
aimed at inhibiting fungal growth in the brain."
10808196,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is among the most common cancers and despite current therapies many
patients relapse from their disease. Recent discoveries have implicated epigenetic mechanisms and non-
classical oncogenic programs as dysregulated in patients with B-cell lymphoma. Protein arginine
methyltransferase-5 (PRMT5), the major enzyme responsible for the arginine symmetric dimethylation of
histones and non-histone proteins, plays an important role in lymphomagenesis, controlling the growth of
transformed B cells. PRMT5 is overexpressed in lymphoma and may represent a novel therapeutic target for
this disease. In order to assess what regulators drive resistance, we performed a genome wide CRISPR screen.
Surprisingly, we uncovered the RNA binding protein MUSASHI2 (MSI2) as the top hit. MSI2 is an RNA binding
protein that has been implicated as a stem related protein that is the most highly expressed in the most
aggressive cancers but its role in B-cell lymphoma is not known. Our preliminary data suggests that MSI2 is
highly expressed in lymphomas and reduction reduces proliferation which is further reduced by PRMT5 inhibition.
We also discovered new post-translational modifications mediated by PRMT1 and PRMT5 in B-cell lymphoma
and demonstrated a functional requirement for these newly discovered modifications. We propose to study this
new PRMT-MSI2 axis in driving lymphomagenesis using genetic mouse models, human lymphoma cell lines
and patient samples. Furthermore, we utilize technological innovations to study direct MSI2 targets and the
mechanism for how MSI2 mediates resistance to PRMT5 inhibition in lymphoma. These studies have broad
implication to how RBPs can become dysregulated and their function controlled by PRMTs in B-cell lymphoma."
10870028,"Background/Rationale: An alternative HIV prophylaxis/treatment modality of growing interest is based on the
premise that the disadvantages stemming from cART use for the prevention/treatment of HIV can be mitigated
by passive immunization with broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies (bNAbs) against the HIV envelope. A pan-
neutralizing antibody could provide a feasible means to treat or prevent HIV infection worldwide.
Objectives: Through systematic deconvolution of circulating plasma anti-HIV envelope responses in HIV+
humans, we identified and characterized unique families of extremely broad and potent anti-CD4 receptor
binding site (CD4bs) bNAbs with distinct CDR domain structural characteristics. Modifications of these bNAbs
generated one iteration, N49P9.6-FR that neutralizes 97% of 117 viruses in a standardized, multi-tier, cross-
subtype panel, with an overall potency that surpasses all other anti-CD4bs bNAbs and equals that of anti-glycan
bNAbs. Further, because of its breadth, N49P9.6-FR covers viruses that are resistant to other anti-CD4bs bNAbs
and is not polyreactive with human antigens in standard tests. Finally, we have generated an “LS” variant
(N49P9.6-FR/LS) with mutations in the Fc domain that prolong circulating half-life. As such, N49P9.6-FR/LS
provides a new opportunity to fully realize the utility of bNAb-based antivirals. However, the path forward
demands demonstrations of efficacy in animal models. Accordingly, the goal of this project is to generate such
data. Our hypothesis is that N49P9.6-FR will exhibit potent prevention and suppression of HIV infection, superior
to related bNAbs now in clinical development. The specific aims of this proposal are 1) Establish the efficacy of
bNAb N49P9.6-FR/LS in humanized mouse models; 2) Establish the protective efficacy of bNAb N49P9.6-FR/LS
in the rhesus macaque/SHIV infection model.
Methods: We will test the ability of N49P9.6-FR/LS to prevent and treat HIV infection in humanized mouse
models and to prevent HIV infection in rhesus macaques. Immunodeficient NSG mice will be reconstituted with
either HIV-1 infected human cells (Hu-PBL mice) or human CD34+ stem cells (Hu-CD34 mice) to examine
preventive and therapeutic efficacy of the bNAb. Rhesus macaques will be challenged with SHIV to examine the
preventive efficacy of the bNAb. In addition, we will complete PK studies with N49P9.6-FR/LS in the mice and
rhesus macaques.
Impact: Upon completion of the project, we expect to have determined that bNAb N49P9.6-FR has the capacity
to provide safe, single-dose, potent, escape-resistant and durable HIV prevention and therapy, superior overall
to other bNAbs. Success in this regard should position bNAb N49P9.6-FR for straightforward translational
development into clinical applications with significant impact."
10896414,"ABSTRACT. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2) are dominantly-inherited degenerative
disorders that cause muscle weakness and multi-systemic symptoms. Both disorders involve RNA toxicity, a
novel gain-of-function mechanism, triggered by expression of RNAs that have thousands of CUG- or CCUG-
repeats (DM1 or DM2, respectively). Key proteins that regulate RNA alternative splicing, that have high affinity
for CUG- and CCUG-repeats, become trapped on repetitive RNA, causing mis-regulated splicing of transcripts
encoding critical components of skeletal muscle. In mouse models we have used a variety of approaches,
including oligonucleotides, gene therapy vectors, and small molecules, to show that reduction of RNA toxicity
causes normalization of RNA splicing and muscle function, suggesting that DM is at least partly reversible. We
also reported that targeted RNAseq analysis of misregulated splice events is reliable and sensitive for
monitoring therapeutic impact in mice, providing a near-real-time assessment of target engagement. These
developments, and prospects for conducting biomarker-driven trials, have spurred many drug development
programs for DM, including some that are now advancing to IND-enabling studies or early-phase trials. To
prepare for these studies we developed human targeted RNAseq similar to that employed in mouse studies.
Building on comprehensive discovery by deep RNAseq of more than 90 muscle samples, we identified
transcripts that show splicing dysregulation, and then developed targeted RNAseq to evaluate 22 splice events
that show large effects in DM1. We then determined a composite splicing index for each sample. The splicing
index stratifies the population in a large cohort of DM1 patients, correlates with the extent of muscle weakness,
shows acceptable test-retest agreement of splicing defects over 2-3 months, and provides a serviceable
pharmacodynamic biomarker. However, as the field advances and we gain more experience, important
limitations have emerged, particularly in the method for obtaining muscle samples and the selection of splice
events for targeted RNAseq – two aspects that are closely linked. Here we seek to optimize and show feasibility
for a new sampling method, called myoaspiration, that enables multi-sampling. i.e. sampling of more muscles
on more occasions. In parallel, we seek to optimize and validate a new targeted RNAseq assay, applicable to
both DM1 and DM2, designed to accommodate myoaspirate samples, and providing greater precision and
stronger inferences about target engagement in muscle fibers. Performance of the assay will be initially
evaluated using previously collected samples in our BioBank, and then proceed to prospective evaluation of
newly-collected myoaspirate samples from DM1 and DM2 patients, focusing on the muscles that are selectively
affected or relatively spared. Upon completion, the project is expected to provide a simple yet effective
pharmacodynamic biomarker for therapeutic trials leading to drug approval, and for post-approval studies to
compare the effectiveness of different agents, regimens, and combinations."
10837873,"Project Summary:
Viral respiratory infections are a leading cause of hospitalization in children. In the absence of co-morbidities,
children are much more likely than adults to require hospitalization for most respiratory viruses, including
influenza A virus (IAV). Age-related changes in innate immune signaling over the first few years of life likely
impact the course of viral respiratory infections, but the mechanisms driving viral-induced respiratory failure in
children are unknown. Viral load has not been associated with severity of illness in children with IAV pneumonia,
so failure to control viral replication is not likely the primary driver of severe illness in children. We have found
that juvenile mice recruit more monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages and have increased activation of the
NLRP3 inflammasome compared to adult mice late in IAV infection. This was associated with increased
production of type I interferon (IFN) in juvenile mice, despite equal viral burden. Importantly, inhibition of
macrophage recruitment decreased type I IFN levels and improved survival in juvenile IAV infection. These data
suggest that age-related differences in type I IFN production in response to IAV infection promote the recruitment
of inflammatory macrophages and contribute to mortality in juvenile mice. In preliminary data, we now show that
genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of the type I IFN receptor, IFNAR1, on recruited macrophages
improves survival in IAV-infected juvenile mice. Therefore, we hypothesize that children fail to recover from
IAV infection due to increased type I IFN signaling and macrophage recruitment to the lungs. We further
hypothesize that recruited macrophages maintain an injurious inflammatory phenotype in the juvenile
lung due to age-related differences in the lung microenvironment. We will test these hypotheses in the
following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine whether age-related differences in the microenvironment of the
juvenile lung promote an inflammatory phenotype in recruited macrophages. Aim 2: Determine whether inhibition
of type I IFN signaling in recruited macrophages decreases lung injury and improves outcomes in juvenile viral
pneumonia. Aim 3: Determine whether increased type I IFN signaling in epithelial cells contributes to severity of
illness in juvenile viral pneumonia. Completion of these aims will identify mechanisms driving viral-induced
respiratory failure in the juvenile host and explore the potential benefit of targeting IFNAR1 signaling in
macrophages to minimize lung injury caused by viral respiratory infections in children. Using age-appropriate
mouse models of IAV pneumonia and multidimensional phenotyping of children with viral-induced respiratory
failure, we are positioned to define key determinants of disease severity in children with IAV pneumonia that will
support the rationale design of new treatment strategies to minimize lung injury and optimize recovery."
10879152,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The proposed project is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of cefixime (400mg, twice a day, for 10 days)
compared to benzathine penicillin G (2.4 million units, intramuscularly) in patients with and without HIV
infection. Syphilis rates have been increasing both in the US and internationally. Incidence is higher among
men-who-have-sex-with-men and more importantly in individuals with HIV infection. Currently, penicillin is used
to treat syphilis in patients with and without HIV infection. Doxycycline, tetracycline and ceftriaxone are
alternative treatments for non-pregnant patients who are allergic to penicillin. Existing treatment alternatives
are based on clinical experience, a limited number of small clinical trials, and case series, but each poses
clinical challenges. New, safe and efficacious antibiotic treatment options are needed.
In this proposal, we will build upon our successful pilot study to conduct a randomized, multisite, open-label, non-
inferiority clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of cefixime (400mg, twice a day, for 10 days) compared to
benzathine penicillin G (2.4 million units, intramuscularly) in patients with and without HIV infection. We will enroll
400 participants with early syphilis infection from 9 clinical sites in the U.S. and Peru. We will follow the
participants to monitor clinical progress and serological response (RPR titer) every 3 months for 9 months. Our
hypothesis is that cefixime will be non-inferior to penicillin in treating syphilis, shown as a 4-fold decrease in
RPR titer from enrollment to 6-months after treatment administration. These are the two specific aims of our
proposal. AIM 1: Evaluate the effectiveness of cefixime in the treatment of early syphilis when compared to
benzathine penicillin G. AIM 2: Determine the predictors of treatment failure among participants.
The 5 year project has 4 phases. Phase I will last 9 months and will involve the development of study
instruments, staff training on recruitment, enrollment, and data collection. Phase II will last 36 months and will
involve recruitment and enrollment of patients. Phase III which will last 45 months, but will start simultaneously
as stage II, and will include the patient follow-up period. Phase IV will last 6 months and in that time, the data
will be analyzed and disseminated."

The proposal in this application outlines a five-year career development plan to prepare the candidate, Dr.
Jonathan Edwards, MD, for a career as an independent physician-scientist defining mechanisms of right
ventricular failure (RVF). The research and development plans are carefully structured to expand Dr. Edwards’s
scientific foundation in cardiovascular research by providing technical training and expertise in in vitro
cardiomyocyte biology, molecular biology, transgenic murine model development, and characterization of RV
function in murine models. Dr. Edwards’s development plan will also strengthen his communication, leadership,
and collaboration skills through attendance of high yield coursework, workshops, and seminars.
RVF is a significant health problem that is a strong predictor of death, and for which there are no proven
therapies. The lack of human or animal work investigating molecular mechanisms of RVF, which could foster
the development of critically needed novel RVF therapies, is a significant gap in our field. I found that the fetal
noncanonical WNT receptor ROR2 is strongly reactivated in the RV of patients with severe RVF and in mice with
RVF from pressure overload. Further, this ROR2 activation was associated with upregulation of the ROR2/Ca2+
responsive protease calpain and target protein cleavage. I hypothesize that pathologic ROR2 expression is a novel
and potentially targetable molecular driver of RVF and pathologic cardiomyocyte remodeling, which acts via
calpain-mediated cytoskeleton and sarcomeric disruption and apoptosis in a subcellular Ca2+-dependent
manner. Three interrelated, but independent Specific Aims will address this hypothesis: 1) Determine the
mechanistic role for Ror2 in in vitro cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton and sarcomeric disruption and apoptosis; 2)
Determine if RV-specific Ror2 overexpression is sufficient to cause RVF; and 3) Determine if RV Ror2 expression
is necessary for pressure overload-induced RVF.
This research training will be conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Zoltan Arany, MD, PhD (Director, Cell
Biology, Physiology, and Metabolism), with co-mentorship by Dr. Benjamin Prosser, PhD (Associate Director,
Penn Muscle Institute) at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Edwards has assembled an interdisciplinary
advisory committee with expertise in in vitro cardiomyocyte biology, molecular biology, translational science,
Ca2+ regulation, WNT signaling, RVF murine modeling, transgenic animal model development, and leadership.
Currently he is a board-eligible pediatric cardiologist, advanced clinical fellow in pediatric cardiomyopathy, heart
failure, and heart transplantation, and a postdoctoral fellow in the Arany laboratory. His long-term career goals
are to serve as a physician-scientist with expertise in RV myocardial biology and the clinical management of
pediatric patients with heart failure as an academic faculty member at a pediatric research hospital. Dr. Edwards
will benefit from his robust and balanced mentorship team, research environment, and unequivocal divisional
and institutional commitment, all of which will support his path to independence."
10874482,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In an effort to provide pain relief to tens of millions of patients with chronic pain, opioids are one of the most
commonly prescribed medications in the United States. Large segments of the population are thus exposed to
the detrimental side effects of opioids, which can be life threatening and include addiction and respiratory failure.
Compulsive opioid use despite these negative consequences defines opioid use disorder, a condition that is
responsible for nearly 50,000 deaths and $80 billion in medical costs annually. Thus, there is an urgent need for
the development of improved treatments for opioid use disorder.
One of the greatest challenges in treating opioid use disorder is its chronic nature with patients often relapsing
after long periods of drug abstinence. Persistent epigenomic changes in the nucleus accumbens of patients with
opioid use disorder are thought to contribute to its chronic, relapsing course. It has remained challenging,
however, to translate this knowledge into novel therapeutic approaches because it has not been possible to
selectively target the epigenomically-modified neurons involved in drug-seeking behavior without also affecting
nearby cells in unrelated circuits.
Here we present an innovative approach to label cells that drive opioid-seeking behavior based on their unique
epigenomic profile. To do this, we will first map at single-cell resolution, the regions of chromatin that are
selectively accessible in mouse nucleus accumbens neurons after morphine self-administration, an established
model of opioid use disorder. Some of these genomic regions will act as functional gene regulatory elements
that activate gene expression (e.g. gene enhancers) after morphine self-administration. To identify these
functional gene enhancers, we will generate an adeno-associated viral library in which each putative element
promotes the expression of a unique barcode. We will then use single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to rapidly screen
this viral library in vivo for the elements that selectively drive expression of their barcode in the nucleus
accumbens neurons that have been epigenomically altered by morphine self-administration. The most selective
viral candidate will be used to express inhibitory chemogenetic channels for controlling morphine-seeking
behavior.
Successful completion of this proposal will establish a fundamentally new approach to selectively label, purify,
and control cells that drive opioid-seeking behavior. This approach offers a number of advantages over current
state-of-the-art technologies including the ability to label cells involved in drug-seeking behavior without need for
transgenic mice or precisely timed conditioned stimuli. By using evolutionarily-conserved gene regulatory
elements to drive viral expression, this approach also has the potential to translate to patients with refractory
opioid use disorder."

10863848,"Insufficient sleep (habitual sleep duration of ≤6 hours), is a costly, prevalent, public health problem associated
with numerous negative health outcomes. Prior research suggests that insufficient sleep is more prevalent
among health disparity populations (e.g., racial minorities, adults of low socioeconomic status), but our
understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of sleep disparities in rural populations is limited. The
present study “Researching Equitable Sleep Time in Kentucky Communities (REST-KY),” focuses on
Appalachian adults, an NIH-designated health disparity population, whose serious health inequities include
multiple health morbidities and premature mortality. Six of the counties with the highest concentration of
insufficient sleep in the nation are in Central Appalachian Kentucky (KY), where 25-58% of adults report
insufficient sleep 15+ nights/month. These counties are severely economically distressed, yet, nearby counties
with comparable economic distress, rurality, and demographic homogeneity are not “hotspots” of insufficient
sleep. Use of a mixed methods, longitudinal design will allow us to evaluate mechanisms contributing to both
sleep deficiencies and health in this rural community. Knowledge gaps include 1) Sparse insights into specific
individual-, social-, and societal-level factors contributing to sleep deficiencies in Appalachian adults.; 2) It is not
known if regional sleep and health disparities share the same underlying mechanisms; and 3) Critical points of
variance between “hotspot” and non-“hotspot” counties have not been examined. We will recruit a cohort of 400
adults from 6 insufficient sleep “hotspot” counties (n=200) in Appalachian KY, and 6 similarly rural and
economically distressed non-“hotspot” counties. Recruitment will be stratified across “hotspot” and non-“hotspot”
counties by key demographic factors linked to sleep deficiencies (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity) to promote county
cluster-level comparisons. Specific Aims. 1. Use mixed methods to compare how individual, social, and societal
factors linked to sleep deficiencies differ between insufficient sleep “hotspot” and non-“hotspot” counties. 2.
Evaluate mechanisms driving sleep deficiencies and health outcomes over time. Bi-directional models of sleep
and health outcomes will be examined. 3. Quantify day-to-day sleep reactivity (i.e., the degree to which daytime
distress impacts sleep) and test if individual differences in sleep reactivity predict worsened health outcomes
over time. Differences by sex and county cluster (“hotspot” vs. non-“hotspot”) will also be examined in Aims 2-3.
Our multiple, sophisticated objective and subjective data collection methods, made possible by our
interdisciplinary team’s varied expertise, will advance scientific knowledge about biological, behavioral,
emotional, and social contributions to sleep health. This holistic approach explicitly acknowledges the
inseparable overlap between health function, and sleep. Our findings will offer unprecedented insight into the bi-
directional relationships between sleep and health in an understudied rural health disparity population. Results
will inform strategies to reduce sleep disparities, thus having strong potential for public health impact."

There is compelling but scant evidence that the increasingly common combination of HIV, methamphetamine
use (MU), and aging form a deleterious trio that undermines cognitive functioning. HIV and MU are both risk
factors for decreased neurocognitive function and evidence shows that continued substance use (SU) after HIV
infection may erode cognitive functioning. Estimates indicate that over 70% of people living with HIV (PWH) will
be >50 years of age in the next decade and older PWH experience a high burden of both lifetime SU and
cognitive impairment. A gap exists in our understanding of the intertwining relationships of SU, HIV, and cognitive
function across biological ages and over time. Examining cognitive change over time and across ages will help
identify potential points of intervention to maintain brain health across the life course. Interventions to reduce MU
and support brain health among aging PWH are vital and improving social relationships is a promising area of
intervention. By applying advanced statistical modeling methods and capitalizing on an exceptional analytic
cohort of 527 adults with and without HIV (ages 18-87) and people who use meth, the proposed study is uniquely
positioned to rigorously advance scientific understanding of these intertwining relationships across ages and
over time among adults with and without HIV. The specific aims of this study are to 1) Assess the validity and
reliability
of the social relationship measures in the NIH Toolbox Emotions Battery in adults aging with vs. without
HIV, to inform Aims 2 and 3 analyses;
2) Examine a) age-varying cognitive impairment among our sample, and
Identify a) the
reciprocal associations between MU and cognitive function over time among people with and without HIV and b)
examine the extent to which social relationships mediate the longitudinal associations between MU and cognitive
function among adults with and without HIV.
b) variations in cognitive function across age by HIV status, MU, and social relationships; and 3)
The proposed K01 will also provide me with a rich opportunity to
become an NIH-funded leader in life course research who applies advanced quantitative and qualitative methods
to conduct high impact, rigorous NIH-funded about the psychosocial needs of PWH with co-occurring SU and
other mental and physical health comorbidities across the lifespan by: (1) deepening my expertise in the
substantive content and measurement of SU and cognitive function; (2) expanding my knowledge about the
measurement of social relationship factors that might mediate relationships of HIV, SU, and cognitive function;
(3) gaining expertise in time-varying effect modeling; and (4) developing my expertise in longitudinal structural
equation modeling, including cross-lagged panel analysis, to examine reciprocal change over time. This research

10868578,"This application is in response to RFA-AG-21-003: New/Unconventional Animal Models of Alzheimer’s Disease
(AD). Currently available animal models of AD mostly model the less common early-onset familial AD and have
poor predictive value in clinical trials. However, nonhuman primates are useful for studying characteristics of
the more clinically relevant late-onset sporadic AD because of their phylogenetic similarity to humans in brain
structure and function; complex endocrine, social, and cognitive characteristics; large size favorable for
imaging studies and cerebrospinal fluid collection; and sequence homology with humans for both tau and Aβ
beta-amyloid (Aβ). Vervets show age-related brain changes similar to humans, including increased Aβ plaque
burden, cognitive and motor deficits, increased AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid, paired helical filament tau
(PHF-tau) formation, decreased brain volumes, decreased cerebral glucose utilization, and altered cortical
transcription profiles. NHPs require further study to understand their apparent resistance to developing
extensive neurofibrillary tangles which may provide insight into mechanisms underlying resilience, to
characterize central nervous system tau species, and to develop PET tracers for Aβ and other targets
associated with AD and dementia .Modifiable risk factors that are potential targets for early intervention in
humans include obesity, hypertension, physical activity, impaired glucose tolerance, psychosocial stress, and
poor sleep. Vervets respond to stress like humans and may become obese. Age increases their rates of
hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance accompanied by decreased Aβ42/Aβ40 in cerebrospinal fluid.
Thus, vervets may provide opportunities for translational and mechanistic research highly relevant to late-onset
sporadic AD. The premise of the proposed research is that vervets are a promising model of late-onset
sporadic AD in which AD-related disease progression could be characterized and altered by early intervention
on modifiable risk factors. The overarching goal is to further develop, characterize, and validate the vervet
model of neuropathology and cognitive decline, while identifying novel targets for early intervention for AD
characteristics. Our Specific Aims are to determine age-related changes in cognitive and physical function,
cerebrospinal fluid and imaging biomarkers; identify targets for early intervention by characterizing modifiable
risk factors for late-onset sporadic AD; and assess the predictive validity of these risk factors for
neuropathology in 30 vervets from our Vervet Research Colony (from 10 to 30 years old) which comprise the
Aging Vervet Cohort. Unique resources at Wake Forest that will assure rapid progress toward our goal include
our Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center; Aging Vervet Cohort, extensive Biospecimen, Data and Image
Repository, unique nonhuman primate imaging capabilities, expertise in nonhuman primate research, and
close collaboration with our Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center."

Over the past 60 years, the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research
(ICPSR) has successfully coordinated the research needs for over 800 universities and
research institutes. This work has led to the expanded use of secondary data, the development
of innovative lines of research, and the training of multiple generations of scholars across the
fields of social and behavioral sciences. The role of the social sciences in understanding major
health challenges and disasters has expanded rapidly over the past several decades, and
ICPSR in partnership with the Institute for Social Research (ISR) has played a key role in
offering an infrastructure to support this work. New areas and new directions have emerged
(e.g., population health, social determinants of health, health equity, growth of longitudinal
studies, and complex national population-based surveys). ICPSR has been able to bring
together and share cutting-edge research emerging from cross disciplinary collaborations in a
systematic manner using an open science model of information distribution. An ICPSR-led
consortium model for social, behavioral, and economic (SBE) research will provide a nexus for
communication, streamlining information-sharing across the behavioral and social science
community, multiple NIH Centers, and to the public. This proposal creates a new independent
Social, Behavioral, and Economic Research on COVID-19 Consortium Coordinating Center
(SBECCC) for COVID-19 related research. The new SBECCC will include resources and
support for research specific to COVID-19. To maximize the growth of cross-disciplinary
research, its mission will also expand to promote collaborative work between the funded U01
projects, other NIH Research Centers, and a multidisciplinary research community each with
different missions, cultures, and ethos. The SBECCC will involve experts from the Survey
Research Center in ISR, the Program for Research on Black Americans in ISR, and the Center
for Health and Research Transformation at the University of Michigan to develop the
consortium, SBE research projects, and produce dissemination materials that aggregate and
synthesize research findings emerging from NIH investments in COVID-19 research."

The overall goal of the Career Enhancement Core at Yale Center for the Study of Tobacco Product Use and
Addiction (YCSTP) is to train the next generation of multidisciplinary, independent scientists in Tobacco
Regulatory Science. Under TCORS 3.0, the Core will continue to support the careers of post-doctoral
associates and junior faculty motivated to become Tobacco Regulatory Science (TRS) investigators
and support the career enhancement of established investigators who seek to pursue new areas of
research. The Core will accomplish its goal by leveraging the successful training program developed in
TCORS 1.0 and 2.0. Specifically, the Core will 1) select and appoint Scholars for a specialized career
enhancement program in TRS; 2) provide didactic and experiential training on FDA regulation of tobacco
products and TRS research, 3) invite speakers who are experts in TRS to enhance knowledge in timely and
impactful TRS research and stimulate new interdisciplinary collaborations, 4) provide opportunities for scientific
exchange through small travel grants to learn new methods, foster collaboration, and attend TRS and other
scientific conferences, and 5) provide pilot research grants to stimulate novel research that addresses the
FDA’s research priorities. The pilot grants will be available to Scholars, new researchers in TRS, or TRS
researchers extending their research to novel areas, to stimulate research innovations. The Career
Enhancement Core will provide a mechanism for review, funding, and ongoing oversight of pilot projects. All
funded projects will receive assistance from the Laboratory Core, Administrative Core, and Measurement and
Analytic Core to achieve their objectives. Through its services, the Career Enhancement Core will support the
careers of new TRS researchers and stimulate TRS science to advance our scientific understanding of nicotine
and flavors in tobacco products and support FDA’s regulatory authority."
10934561,"ABSTRACT – LABORATORY CORE
The YCSTP’s goal is to reduce tobacco use and addiction. By understanding better how tobacco product
constituents such as coolants, flavorants, sweeteners, nicotine source (natural vs. synthetic) and nicotine
enantiomer (S- vs. R-) ratio influence appeal, we aim to inform the FDA about the risk of nicotine addiction and
harm. Optimal interpretation of the study outcomes requires that key chemical components are accurately
quantified in tobacco products and in biological samples from the study participants. The main objective of
the Laboratory Core is to provide accurate, reproducible, and timely characterization and
quantification of such components in support of the projects and pilots of the Center, as well as to
create custom e-liquids when necessary. The core will attain its objective by pursuing five specific aims. (1)
To identify and accurately quantify chemicals in tobacco products and in vapors produced from them, such as
nicotine (including R- and S- enantiomers), synthetic coolants and menthol, flavorants, sweeteners, and other
compounds of interest. (2) To generate objective and quantitative estimates of exposure to, and harm from,
tobacco products by measuring the following biomarkers in biological samples: nicotine, cotinine, 3-hydroxy
cotinine, total nicotine equivalents, nicotelline, menthol glucuronide, and NNAL (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-
pyridyl)-1-butanol). (3) To maintain a database of tobacco product constituents, such as flavorants, coolants,
and sweeteners. (4) To create custom e-liquids for ongoing studies when commercial products are not
available due to market changes. (5) To maintain a repository of biological samples obtained from the study
participants. The core will also be able to set up other assays, as mandated by the evolving needs of the
center. Over the past 9 years, this core has significantly advanced knowledge about tobacco product
constituents, including novel ones, and particularly how these constituents contribute to addiction and
harm. The core will be successful because: (a) many of the chemical assays necessary for aims 1 and 2 are
validated and ready for immediate use, (b) the core has an extensive track record of detecting novel tobacco
product constituents of concern, (c) the core has the necessary expertise, facilities and equipment to set up
new assays in a timely fashion, (d) the database (aim 3) and biorepository (aim 5) are already in place and can
readily be expanded to accommodate the data and samples obtained from the new projects, and (e) the core
has experience in creating custom e-liquids (aim 4). By providing these services reliably to the YCSTP, the
Laboratory Core will contribute critically toward the success of YCSTP’s TCORS 3.0 projects, which will
ultimately aid in informing the FDA on the risk of nicotine addiction in new products and constituents."
10934562,"Abstract: The Yale Measurement and Analytics Core (MAC)
The quality of the data obtained from a study is inextricably linked to the quality of measurement that is used.
Psychometrically sound measures improve data quality in numerous ways including ensuring that constructs
are measured accurately and dependably and reducing measurement error that could impact findings. In turn,
employing proper statistical methods allows us to draw meaningful and impactful conclusions from our data to
further scientific knowledge. The Measurement and Analytics Core – the first of its kind – will uniquely prioritize
these key aspects of scientific inquiry as a Core to ensure the integrity of the research generated by the Yale
Center for the Study of Tobacco Products and directly increase its utility for informing the FDA's regulatory
efforts. The MAC comprises two teams - The Measurement Team and the Analytics Team. Both teams will
contribute to each of the Core's three specific aims: (1) to ensure the use of validated measures and statistical
procedures across projects and pilot studies to increase the scientific rigor, interpretability, and impact of
findings, (2) to develop novel psychometrically sound measures and statistical approaches to address pressing
needs in Tobacco Regulatory Science, and (3) to provide training in measurement, statistics, and the use of
nationally representative data (i.e., The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study [PATH]) to
address Tobacco Regulatory Science research questions. In addition to ensuring the quality of the science
generated by our Center and advancing the measurement and statistical knowledge and actionable skills of
our faculty and trainees, the MAC will widely disseminate its new measures, statistical methodology, and
didactics through publications and other outlets (Coordinating Center webinars, the TRS Knowledge Center
website, measurement banks like the PhenX Toolkit, NIH Toolbox®, or PROMIS®) to enhance the overall
quality and impact of Tobacco Regulatory Science and to facilitate cross-TCORS collaborations. The success
of the MAC will be driven by the expertise of its members. The MAC will be led by Drs. Meghan Morean and
Ralitza Gueorguieva, who will lead the Measurement Team and Analytics Team, respectively. Dr. Morean is an
expert in the development and psychometric evaluation of self-report measures to improve the quality of
substance-related research. Of note, she developed a novel measure of e-cigarette dependence, the only e-
cigarette related measure adopted into the prestigious PROMIS® measurement bank. Dr. Gueorguieva is an
expert in statistical modeling, data visualization, and applying innovative statistical approaches to Tobacco
Regulatory Science. She has led all statistical efforts for Yale TCORS 1.0 and 2.0 and has more than 20 years
of highly productive collaborations on human lab experimental studies, clinical trials, and observational studies.
The MAC also will be supported by Drs. Grace Kong (expert in qualitative research and survey methodology),
Eugenia Buta (expert in complex data analysis, data visualization, and statistical methodology) and Patricia
Simon (expert in advanced longitudinal research methods and use of PATH general and restricted datasets)."
10903823,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
This K23 award will enable the candidate, Shih-Chuan Chou, MD, MPH, SM, to become an independent
physician-scientist focused on the effect of out-of-pocket costs on care utilization and outcomes of acute chest
pain and cardiovascular care. Chest pain is one of the most common reasons for emergency department (ED)
evaluation, with over 7 million visits annually. ED visits ensure the timely identification and treatment of acute
myocardial infarction (AMI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, the financial implications of care
have escalated over the past two decades with the growth of high deductible health plans (HDHP). By 2020,
nearly 6 in 10 US employees with employer-sponsored insurance will have deductibles of ≥$1,000. While
research has begun to explore HDHP’s effect on cancer screening and chronic disease management, little
research has examined how it affects acute cardiovascular care. In a preliminary study, Dr. Chou found that
HDHP enrollment reduced ED visits for non-specific chest pain but increased AMI after chest pain admission
among the lower-income population. In this K23, Dr. Chou will further extend this research with 3 proposed
aims. Aim 1 will use segmented survival analysis in a large commercial claims database to examine whether
employer-mandated HDHP enrollment negatively impacted AMI outcomes. Using the same database, aim 2
will utilize the natural randomization of patients to ED clinicians within each ED to determine whether HDHP
reduces low-value chest pain admissions among clinicians with high admitting tendencies. Lastly, aim 3 will
include patient surveys and interviews to elicit chest pain and AMI patients’ perspectives on how high out-of-
pocket costs affected their decisions to seek care, perceived care quality, and subsequent financial impact. All
aims will further focus on low-income patients that face disproportionate financial stress. Dr. Chou proposed a
comprehensive career development curriculum to complement these aims, consisting of extensive didactic and
experiential learning. Dr. Chou has assembled an interdisciplinary team of mentors with recognized expertise
in quasi-experimental observational studies, insurance benefit design, cardiovascular emergencies, health care
disparities, and emergency medicine, who will provide him with intensive mentorship in these topics. The
proposed research and career development activities will allow Dr. Chou to establish his expertise in
insurance-related policies, the financial burden of care, and their impact on the use and outcomes of patients
with acute cardiovascular conditions. This award will enable Dr. Chou to transition into an independent
clinician-scientist focusing on the short- and long-term impact of high out-of-pocket costs and the implications
around the growing implementation of price transparency and cost discussions for acute unscheduled care
visits. Completing the proposed research will generate robust evidence to advance the understanding of the
clinical impact of patient financial burden, guide future regulations around insurance cost-sharing policies, and
inform the implementation of price transparency initiatives in acute cardiovascular care."

The goal is to identify and characterize prostate cancer objectively and accurately using a rapid
quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) approach. The standard-of-care in patients
being evaluated for suspicion of prostate cancer is systematic sampling of the entire gland with
12 biopsy cores, without an identified focus suspicious for cancer on imaging. Current qualitative
MR images, while mostly successful in highlighting prostate cancer, may look different from
scanner to scanner, or even when repeated on the same scanner. This variability adds complexity
to an already subjective interpretive process of detecting cancer and discriminating between
clinically significant and indolent disease. Thus, more robust and standardized MRI methods to
detect and characterize clinically significant prostate cancer are needed.
This project plans to address this issue with following specific aims:
(1) A rapid high-resolution 3D MRF acquisition will be developed and optimized for prostate
cancer assessment by innovating reduced field-of-view imaging, 3D Cartesian sampling, and
advanced reconstruction in MRF. The proposal MRF acquisition will enable accurate T1 and T2
mapping over the prostate gland with an isotropic submillimeter resolution (0.8 mm3) in an
acquisition time of less than 5 minutes.
(2) Contrast-weighted images synthesized using MRF-based T1 and T2 maps will replace
conventional qualitative images for detecting prostate cancer.
(3) MRF-based T1 and T2 with apparent diffusion coefficient will be validated to separate cancer
from non-cancer and differentiate cancers with different grades.
(4) Microstructural signatures of prostate cancer derived from MRF will provide information about
subvoxel components (epithelium, stroma, lumen, and their volume fractions) to reveal occult
cancers and enable the discrimination of different grades of cancer.
This project will advance prostate imaging by providing reproducible and repeatable non-invasive
quantitative imaging metrics. These innovations will replace conventional contrast-weighted
imaging with a single rapid high-resolution standard MRF protocol, provide an objective
identification of prostate cancer and grading, and improve the classification of prostate cancer
using microstructural signatures, thus reducing unnecessary biopsies and facilitating appropriate
treatment selection."
10884209,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs), a type of genome instability, are often seen in inherited and
sporadic cancers and are an important driver of malignant progression. For example, hereditary breast and
ovarian cancers resulting from BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations suffer from homologous recombination
repair (HRR) defects that increase GCRs in model systems. Our previous studies have established a
comprehensive network of genome instability suppressor (GIS) genes in yeast and demonstrated in silico that
human homologs of these yeast GIS genes are genetically and/or epigenetically altered across many cancer
types. From yeast genetic studies, we have also identified and rank-ordered synthetic lethal (SL) partners of
non-essential GIS genes. The feasibility of targeting SL genetic interactions for rational cancer therapy has
been supported by the application of PARP inhibitors for maintenance therapy of breast and ovarian cancers
with BRCA1 or BRCA2 defects. To exploit additional SL interactions for cancer therapy, this proposal aims to
leverage the wealth of knowledge on GIS genes and their SL partners developed in yeast to guide the
development of therapeutics that target human GIS gene defects that cause GCRs in cancer. Specifically, the
proposed studies will focus on the human Flap Endonuclease 1 (FEN1), the homolog of yeast RAD27, which
has the highest number of SL-interactions with GIS genes of a variety of functions. FEN1 processes Okazaki
fragments during lagging strand DNA synthesis and acts in long-patch base excision repair but is itself non-
essential. To develop this nuclease as a target for treating cancers with defects in BRCA1, BRCA2 and other
FEN1-SL partner GIS genes, we propose to carry out the following lines of research: AIM 1) To expand
ongoing CRISPR-dropout screens and validation studies in cell lines and mice to (a) identify human genes in
which defects cause sensitivity to our proprietary FEN1-inhibitors of highly potency and specificity and (b)
define FEN1 SL-partner genes as well as cancer omics signatures that can be targeted with FEN1 inhibitors to
induce SL; AIM 2) To combine informatics and cell-based validation approaches for a deep-dive into cancer
omics and gene essentiality data to identify the spectrum and signatures of cancers amenable to therapeutic
targeting with FEN1 inhibitors; AIM 3) To apply an array of genetics-based approaches to investigate
mechanisms for acquired resistance to FEN1 inhibitors and to compare resistance to FEN1 versus PARP
inhibitors; and, AIM 4) To determine the effects of FEN1 inhibition on DNA replication, fork stability, and
chromosome integrity in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutant cells to test the hypothesis that FEN1 inhibitors induce
irreparable damage to replication forks in HRR-deficient cancer cells to cause lethality. These mechanistic
studies will be extended to other validated FEN1-SL partner genes. These projects will greatly accelerate the
development of FEN1 inhibitors to target cancer genome instability and will establish an experimental platform
for evaluation and development of other potential therapeutic targets to be identified by the proposed research."

Oncogenic KRASG12C (KG12C) mutations underpin the development of ~13% of non-squamous non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) and account for ~10,000 deaths annually in the U.S. The development of potent, selective and
clinically active covalent inhibitors of the KG12C oncoprotein represents one of the most exciting recent advances
in the field of targeted cancer therapy, yet strategies to circumvent the development of adaptive resistance and
improve the durability of individual responses to KG12C inhibitors are urgently needed in order to transform clinical
outcomes for patients. In addition to their tumor cell-intrinsic effects, KG12C inhibitors recondition the tumor
immune microenvironment in preclinical models and synergize with anti-PD-1 therapy to promote long-term
tumor regressions and immunological memory. The mechanisms that underpin KG12C inhibitor-triggered immune
pathway activation in KG12C NSCLC are poorly understood. Furthermore, the optimal combinations of KG12C
inhibitors with standard of care (SOC) first-line NSCLC systemic therapies including platinum-doublet
chemotherapy, PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy and chemo-immunotherapy in order to maximize antitumor immunity
have not been established. Furthermore, the impact of co-occurring genomic alterations in STK11/LKB1, KEAP1,
TP53 and RBM10 – that shape the immune contexture of KRAS-mutant NSCLC and modify its response to PD-
1 axis blockade – on the clinical efficacy and immunological sequelae of KG12C inhibitor-based therapeutic
combinations has not been systematically examined. Based on our preliminary findings and previous work we
hypothesize that: 1. Induction of immunogenic cell death contributes to KG12C inhibitor-triggered immune pathway
activation in KG12C NSCLC; 2. KG12C inhibitors exhibit immune-sensitizing effects that can be further enhanced
with the addition of chemotherapy and/or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI); 3. Co-occurring genomic alterations
impact both clinical and immunological responses to KG12C inhibitor mono- and combination therapy in KG12C
NSCLC. In Aim 1, we will dissect mechanisms and molecular determinants of KG12C inhibitor-mediated immune
sensitization in KG12C NSCLC. In Aim 2, we will evaluate synergistic KG12C inhibitor interactions with standard of
care first-line systemic therapies (including platinum-doublet chemotherapy, PD-(L)1 inhibitor monotherapy and
chemo-immunotherapy) in immune-competent mouse models of KG12C-mutant NSCLC. In Aim 3, we will validate
treatment-induced changes in the KG12C NSCLC immune contexture at whole-tumor and single-cell resolution
using clinical samples from patients with surgically resected KG12C NSCLC who were treated with neo-adjuvant
AMG 510 in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in an investigator-initiated phase 2 clinical trial.
Clinical significance: This work will yield fresh insights into mechanisms and determinants of immune pathway
activation in response to KG12C inhibitor mono- and combination therapy and will facilitate the development of
personalized co-mutation-tailored combination therapeutic strategies that aim to maximize the immune-
sensitizing potential and long-term clinical benefit from KG12C inhibitors."

This is a competing continuation to support six post-doctoral positions to provide
rigorous research training for pulmonary physicians at the fellowship level and Ph.D.
recipients with interests in lung disease. The ultimate goal is to develop pulmonary
scientists in either basic or translational research who can successfully continue their
careers in academics or the biomedical industry. After completion of clinical or Ph.D.
training, all trainees begin a two year (minimum) period of virtually uninterrupted time for
research training. One of two tracks can be chosen. For those choosing a basic
science pathway, the key training activities will be mentored time in a basic research
laboratory, supplemented by attendance at research conferences and seminars and a
variety of course work. For those choosing the translational pathway, the key training
activities will be mentored time conducting a clinical research project coupled with a
series of classes focused on gaining clinical trial skills. Translational applicants will be
closely ""tethered"" to a basic science lab, although they will not be required to complete a
laboratory project. Training will be supplemented by attendance at research
conferences and seminars. Select trainees will be provided with a third year of research
training. All trainees selected for this training grant are assigned a mentoring committee,
similar to a graduate student thesis committee, that carefully tracks each trainee's
progress throughout their research training and transition to faculty status or other
research job opportunities. The program will continue to foster broad multidisciplinary
approaches to research with strong ties to trainers outside of the Pulmonary Division.
This will be strengthened by a newly established “Institute for Lung Biology” with
accompanying unified space for lung research. Changes in this renewal application are
addition of selected faculty with unique training expertise, increased availability of a
Master in Translational Research degree, and an enlargement of the applicant pool by
including qualified Pediatric Pulmonary Fellows from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
Continued efforts to increase minority recruitment are also planned."

Blood Disorders (NCCBD) sites received funding as a NCI Community Oncology Research Program dedicated
to children with cancer through participation in the Children's Oncology Group (COG) Research Base trials.
The Nemours Alfred I duPont Hospital for Children (NCCBD-Wilmington, DE), Nemours Children's Clinics
(NCCBD-Jacksonville, Florida), Nemours Children's Hospital (NCCBD-Orlando, FL) and Sacred Heart,
Pensacola, FL all had outstanding records of clinical trial participation and collaboration under the Nemours
NCORP operational structure. In the current application, the Nemours NCORP will add a fifth site, Broward
Heath (Ft. Lauderdale, Florida) to improve the enrollment of minority and underserved patients.
 The mission of the Nemours NCORP is to ensure that each child and young adolescent within our
community-based catchment area has the opportunity to participate in national cancer control, cancer
prevention, and cancer treatment trials as appropriate. The Nemours NCORP will continue to sustain systems
supportive of cancer control, cancer prevention, care delivery, and treatment research, as well as to maintain
robust quality management and improvement practices. Through Nemours' already well-established network of
healthcare institutions, community-based physician practices, and strong community ties, we will continue to
extend access to research trials to children from all ethnicities and cultural backgrounds. Inclusive of all sites,
the Nemours NCORP is consistently among the highest enrolling contributors to the Children's Oncology
Group Research Base studies, providing the opportunity to learn from all children with ultra-rare diseases. The
Nemours NCORP will continue and grow a childhood cancer research infrastructure that achieves the following
aims: 1) To ensure continued robust accrual to NCI-funded clinical trials, through the meaningful use of
electronic resources and best practices across the continuum of care, 2) To expand and maintain an
infrastructure supportive of productive and efficient participation in NCI-funded Cancer Care
Prevention (CCP) and Care Delivery (CD) Research (CCDR), and 3) To foster community engagement
through dissemination, discussion, and adoption of results from clinical trials, and through physician,
family, and community education."

 Drug abuse is a debilitating relapsing disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite
negative personal consequences. Repeated exposure to drugs of abuse is accompanied by persistent alterations
in molecular processes, including alterations in transcription factors that regulate altered neuronal plasticity and
function, which underlie the persistent behavioral responses associated with substance use disorder. Recent
work demonstrates that mitochondrial processes can play a role in neuronal plasticity mechanisms. We
uncovered a role for mitochondria fission and its molecular mediator, Drp1, in mediating plasticity adaptations in
nucleus accumbens (NAc) D1 expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs). Further, Drp1 and fission are
necessary for cocaine seeking-behavior. Despite these initial studies there is still a large deficit in our
understanding into how mitochondrial processes integrate into circuit adaptations across brain reward regions
that occur with psychostimulant exposure. Moreover, there is poor understanding of the upstream transcriptional
processes that regulate molecules mediating mitochondrial function in brain reward regions.
 Our studies will bridge this gap by investigating the impact of cocaine intravenous self-administration
(IVSA) on (1) the excitatory inputs to NAc that regulate mitochondrial processes in MSN subtypes and their
influence on drug seeking behavior, (2) the impact of mitochondrial fission in D1-MSNs on NAc output regions,
and (3) explore mitochondrial molecules and processes, and their upstream transcriptional regulators, in NAc
MSN subtypes and their input and output regions. To do these we employ AAV intersectional tools to manipulate
or label NAc input and output neurons while also targeting NAc MSNs in cocaine IVSA. We use chemogenetic
approaches to examine the impact of NAc excitatory inputs on mitochondrial dynamics and molecular mediators
in NAc MSN subtypes. We further examine the interaction between excitatory inputs and mitochondrial fission
in D1-MSNs on drug seeking behavior. We also examine the impact of mitochondrial fission in D1-MSNs on
ventral pallidum (VP) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) output regions in IVSA at the level of drug seeking
behavior, dopamine dynamics, and molecular adaptations. Finally, we perform a large scale profiling across
reward circuit neurons after IVSA of mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial molecular mediators and
transcriptional regulators, and mito-omics. We further, use CRISPR epigenome tools to characterize cocaine-
mediated transcription factor regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial molecular mediators across

10901956,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a severe, antibody (ab)-mediated prothrombotic syndrome with
high morbidity and mortality. The biochemical basis of the distinction between “pathogenic” platelet-activating
antibodies and “benign” non-activating HIT antibodies is not well understood. This results in significant
diagnostic challenges and in excessive use of non-heparin alternative anticoagulation that have worse
bleeding profiles than heparin. Outcomes in HIT are suboptimal despite current therapy with direct thrombin
inhibitors: One-third of affected patients develop thrombosis and one in ten patients dies. The proposed studies
will explore key unanswered questions in areas of HIT pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. For Aim 1,
we hypothesize the existence of multiple functional classes of HIT antibodies: (1) Pathogenic antibodies that
recognize PF4-treated platelets with or without reactivity to PF4-heparin complexes, and (2) Benign abs that
recognize PF4-heparin but not platelets treated with PF4. We will identify and characterize these antibody
classes by chromatography-based isolation from patient samples and will generate novel HIT monoclonal
antibodies in each of these functional classes. Generated monoclonal antibodies will be tested for
pathogenicity in a HIT mouse model and results will be correlated with their serologic characteristics. Obtaining
and processing normal donor platelets is a major challenge that limits the availability of functional “gold
standard” testing in HIT. In Aim 2, we will develop a rapid HIT diagnostic test using the patient’s own platelets
treated with PF4/heparin. This will facilitate “in-hospital” HIT diagnosis leading to early detection of this
condition. Currently used non-heparin alternative anticoagulants do not address the most proximal event in
HIT: Activation of platelets by HIT antibodies. Given this, breakthrough thrombosis is frequently seen in
patients under treatment and so is unintended bleeding caused by the potent non-heparin anticoagulants used.
In Aim 3, we will use platelet-derived and synthetic chondroitin sulfates of various sulfation levels and
saccharide lengths to evaluate their ability to inhibit HIT-antibody mediated platelet activation in vitro and to
ameliorate thrombocytopenia in a HIT murine model. In Aim 1, we expect to successfully separate and
characterize multiple functional classes of HIT antibodies which will suggest new ways to selectively detect
only the pathogenic ones. Developing and optimizing a diagnostic method using the patient’s own platelets in
Aim 2 will transform platelet-activation based HIT testing by moving it from the reference laboratory
environment to the in-hospital setting. Finally, studies described in Aim 3 will introduce a new class of
therapeutics in HIT, chondroitin sulfates, that will prevent thrombosis, but unlike current therapies, will not
increase the risk of bleeding. In summary, we anticipate that all three aims of this proposal will lead to a
significant impact on pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of HIT."

The overall objective of the NEI Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Program Award at UCSD is to develop
outstanding clinician scientists to successfully compete for NIH grants and emerge as leaders within academic
ophthalmology. Through this institutional career development award, we will continue to mentor clinician
scientists toward independent academic appointments in ophthalmology. Since 1991, the UC San Diego Shiley
Eye Institute has excelled in mentoring the career development of clinician scientists throughout ophthalmology.
Many of these individuals now have successful research and clinical careers around the world; they include
Department Chairs, Division Chiefs, and impactful academicians. With continued funding, we will amplify these
strengths through a structured program of mentoring, research, and education to identify and mentor the next
generation of academic clinician scientists, across all subspecialty areas of ophthalmology.
With an emphasis on recruiting strong applications from women and minority applicants, Scholars will be
selected each year after their completion of a post-residency clinical fellowship in ophthalmology. The Scholar
will undertake these activities in the area of basic and/or clinical sciences appropriate to their scientific focus,
and by partnering with mentor(s) to facilitate career development. Each Scholar will be trained in clinically
relevant research, statistics, scientific writing, grant preparation, ethics, leadership, and the responsible conduct
of research. Additional aspects of the curriculum of each Scholar will be individualized by the Program Director
(PI), Research Directors, Education Director, Executive Committee, Mentoring Group, and lead mentor based
upon the Scholar's selected primary research track and his/her skills, background, and career goals. Each
Scholar will create an original research program and through this Award develop an independent academic
career.
We propose six primary research tracks: (1) Visual Neuroscience, (2) Genomics and Proteomics, (3)
Bioengineering, (4) Stem Cell Biology, (5) Artificial Intelligence and Informatics, and (6) Clinical (human subjects)
Research.
In the first K12 funding period, we trained and recruited four clinician scientists in the subspecialty areas of retina
(2), glaucoma (1), and pediatric ophthalmology (1). Two of these Scholars already have received NIH K08
awards, and the other two have submitted K08 proposals that are under consideration."

This study will advance the current understanding of how management procedures that involve predictability,
opportunity and control can be implemented proactively to accomplish meaningful reductions in stress, social
aggression and trauma that generate a net cost savings for the CNPRC (and other primate facilities). Our
investigation of social network structure and dynamics using novel network measures and techniques will allow
us to gain a deeper understanding of whether/how these management strategies accomplish such reductions
in stress and trauma, such as offering methodologies for examining the complexity of social stability, and our
utilization of a thorough economic approach to calculate all costs associated with implementation of
management procedures will allow us to conclude with certainty which management strategies reduce
hospitalizations due to stress and trauma with minimal increases in staff time to yield significant cost savings
for the CNPRC (and other primate facilities), and ultimately improve animal health and well-being in a cost-
effective fashion."

The overarching goal of the Chicago Center on Musculoskeletal Pain (C-COMP) is to foster and support
research and training aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying pain associated with
musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases, with the ultimate goal of better managing and preventing it. To support high-
quality, innovative research that will accelerate our understanding of the mechanisms underlying MSK pain
and, hence, facilitate identification of new therapeutic targets, we will capitalize on existing expertise and
resources to create a Neurobiology Core C that will provide state-of-the-art physiological, transcriptomal, and
neuroanatomical tools as well as scientific expertise for studying the mechanisms of MSK pain. The methods
offered in this core have been chosen to synergize with the behavioral assessments offered in Core B.
Technologies for studying the mechanisms through which the peripheral and central nervous systems
coordinate to produce pain signaling have become much more sophisticated over the last decade, leading to
many new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying chronic pain states. Our laboratories at Rush and
Northwestern University - in large parts through NIAMS supported funding - have led the way in developing
these tools for use in studying MSK pain in particular. The adoption of these sophisticated techniques in the
broader MSK field is, however, hindered by a lack of availability to most laboratories. The resources and
services selected for this core have been chosen to fill this need. Our own combined cumulative experience
(>50 years) and established innovation and international leadership in bridging the neuroscience and MSK
fields, and our expertise in these various technologies provides us with unique qualifications for advising
researchers studying the neurobiology of MSK pain. Aim 1. Establish a centralized service for assessing
physiological changes in the peripheral nervous system of preclinical models of MSK disease. The
Core will provide consultation, scientific expertise, technical training, and technical services for the evaluation
of sensory neuron physiology through the use of calcium imaging, including in vivo calcium imaging,
electrophysiology, and chemo/opto-genetics. Aim 2. Establish a centralized resource for transcriptomal
analysis of the peripheral nervous system. The Core will provide training and technical services for
collecting and preparing dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons for RNA-seq (bulk and single cell). Aim 3. Provide
a centralized resource for studying plasticity in neuroanatomy in preclinical MSK models. The core will
provide technical assistance and training for performing anatomical studies of the peripheral nervous system -
particularly joint innervation, including intra-articular innervation, immunohistochemistry of DRG, RNAscope in
situ hybridization, tissue culture of DRG cells, and genetic tools for labeling particular types of cells (reporter
mice, AAVs), and lightsheet imaging. Aim 4. We will present seminars and provide training and
enrichment programs for enhancing the understanding of C-COMP investigators in how to experimentally
explore mechanisms of pain in MSK and rheumatic diseases."

The goal of the Research Training Program in Pediatric Cardiovascular Disease is to attract and train highly
qualified MD, MD-PhD, and PhD scientists dedicated to advancing the understanding, diagnosis, treatment,
and prevention of pediatric and congenital heart disease. The program is based in the Department of
Cardiology at Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH), a leading national and international center for pediatric
cardiology and treatment of congenital heart disease. The 34 Faculty Mentors in this T32 include outstanding
and highly collaborative scientists - drawn from BCH, Harvard Medical School (HMS) and its affiliated
hospitals, and MIT - with expertise in basic, translational, and clinical research relevant to pediatric
cardiovascular disease. Together, they hold $34.9M in total support for the current year. Of those supported in
the past 15 years, 91% remain active in research, 76% continue in academia, and 18% are from under-
represented groups. A Research Training Executive Committee (RTEC), comprising the Program Directors
and four current mentors, will oversee the progress of fellow training, career development, and mentoring,
approve new mentors, and ensure that existing mentors meet the metrics of the training program. We are
requesting 8 trainee positions, on average supporting the training of 4 with MD or MD-PhD degrees and 4 with
PhD degrees each year. Entry into the T32 training program is highly competitive – from our highly talented
candidate pool, ~7% are selected for T32 support. We will expose trainees to the clinical, translational, or basic
research techniques that represent the current state of the art. A Core Curriculum will include training in
biostatistics, Work-in-Progress meetings, a cardiovascular seminar series, a hands-on didactic series in
cardiac anatomy, and career development seminars. Trainees will also participate in an annual retreat and
regular meetings attended by T32 trainees and mentors. Through these interchanges, clinically-oriented
trainees will gain understanding of fundamental cardiovascular biology, and basic science trainees will gain
understanding of important clinical problems. The program allows trainees to further tailor their training to
specific research interests by taking advantage of the stellar opportunities for formal coursework and the
myriad of scientific seminars and lectures at BCH, HMS, the Harvard School of Public Health, and MIT. We
also teach trainees the importance of teamwork, the clear communication of research findings, responsible
conduct of human and laboratory research, and mentoring skills. Milestones and metrics for trainee progress
and the training program itself are outlined and will be overseen by the RTEC. Considerable institutional
support includes supplementation of trainee stipends and travel funds, and support for the EAC and program
activities. Excellent training in rigorous experimental bench research and in translational and clinical
investigation within an interactive and vibrant program will prepare graduates to become leaders in pediatric
cardiology and cardiovascular research."
10912638,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Uterovaginal prolapse (UVP) is one of the most common conditions affecting women, with a 20% lifetime risk
of UVP corrective surgery. Surgeries performed for UVP include either a vaginal or abdominal approach, with
or without use of mesh, to correct defects in pelvic support. Accumulated evidence has shown that for post-
hysterectomy pelvic organ prolapse (POP) repair, the use of mesh yields superior patient outcomes compared
to vaginal repair without compromising patient safety. However, no high-quality data exists to help guide
patients and surgeons on the best option for treatment of UVP of the two most commonly performed
procedures: 1) vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament suspension (TVH+USLS) and 2) minimally
invasive hysterectomy with sacrocolpopexy (MI-SCH+SCP).
Furthermore, surgical decision making is based on studies which evaluate objective measures of success, with
the vast majority of seminal trials not taking into account patient-centered outcomes related to choosing a
surgery such as: time off work, return to normal activity, need for caregivers/support persons and patient
expectations for what constitutes successful surgery and improvement in quality of life. To fill this knowledge
gap, this multi-institutional comparative study between TVH+USLS and MI-SCH+SCP will have three specific
aims.
First, the study will evaluate 3-year surgical failure rates, assessed at 6-month intervals postoperatively for MI-
SCH+SCP compared to TVH+USLS; where surgical failure is defined as presence of at least one of the
following: 1) presence of vaginal prolapse defined as a lead point of prolapse beyond the hymen on exam, 2)
report of bothersome vaginal bulge symptoms irrespective of prolapse stage, or 3) retreatment of symptomatic
prolapse with pessary, or surgery. Second, the study will compare outcomes related to perioperative care and
recovery including short-term outcomes: post-operative pain, opioid analgesia use, nausea, fatigue, surgical
morbidity and long-term outcomes related to body image, sexual, bowel and bladder function assessed
immediate postoperatively at 1 month, and at 6 month intervals thereafter. Finally, the study will involve
qualitative interviews of a sub-set of women conducted prior to surgery, and at 3 months and 24 months after
surgery. The results of these interviews will be incorporated with objective outcomes to develop a
comprehensive, patient-centered approach to the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse."

Chronic pain is a prevalent, disabling problem affecting as many as 50% of men and 75% of women Veterans.
The psychosocial pain treatment with the most empirical support is cognitive behavior therapy (CBT).
However, not everyone benefits from CBT. Prior research has shown that two complementary and integrative
health (CIH) interventions, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Hypnotic Cognitive Therapy
(HYP-CT), are beneficial and offer alternatives to CBT and have similar efficacy. As with CBT, individual
response to these treatments also varies considerably. Our preliminary data suggests the variability in
treatment outcome may be due to important baseline patient differences. This suggests the possibility that
patients can be effectively “matched” to the treatments they are most likely to benefit from, based on
information that can be obtained before treatment starts. Research is needed to develop patient-treatment
matching algorithms that could match a given individual to the evidence-based treatment most likely to be
beneficial given their unique individual profile. The overall aim of the proposed study is to address this need by
identifying patient factors that determine who benefits most from two CIH treatments and the current gold
standard non-pharmacological treatment (CBT), relative to usual care. This aim will be addressed using a
clinical trial in which participants will be randomized to one of the four treatment conditions. We will test
hypotheses – developed from both theory and prior pilot research – that pre-treatment brain activity patterns,
hypnotizability, catastrophizing, and mindfulness moderate pre- to post-treatment improvements in pain
intensity associated with group-delivered CBT, MBCT, and HYP-CT, relative to usual care, in Veterans with
chronic pain. The findings will provide the foundation for building an algorithm to support personalized care,
whereby Veterans can be offered the treatment that will be most beneficial for them. This study will also help
develop knowledge about potentially powerful alternatives to pharmacological analgesic approaches. Finally,
the study findings will be useful to health care providers and their patients to facilitate shared decision-making."

 Dr. Heather McCauley is mentored by Dr. James Wells at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical
Center (CCHMC), the largest pediatric research institution in the nation. CCHMC ranked 2nd in NIH support in
2017 and is home to an NIDDK-sponsored Digestive Diseases Research Center with a vibrant community of
physicians and scientists. CCHMC provides a very supportive training environment for young investigators. Dr.
McCauley proposes an innovative cross-disciplinary research plan which bridges developmental biology, stem
cell and organoid medicine, gastroenterology and nutrition, endocrinology, and metabolism.
 Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are specialized intestinal epithelial cells which secrete more than 20
bioactive peptides to regulate satiety, gut motility, glucose homeostasis, nutrient absorption, and whole-body
metabolism in response to ingested nutrients. While the systemic targets of EEC hormones are well known,
such as the brain and the pancreas, the role of EEC peptides in regulating the function of the intestine itself is
surprisingly understudied. Our lab has developed a unique, high-throughput human model system to test the
roles of individual EEC peptides on intestinal function by generating EEC-deficient human intestinal organoids
from pluripotent stem cells. We recently used this model system to show that some EECs regulate ion-coupled
nutrient absorption in neighboring cells. Because EECs are nutrient-sensing cells, we considered that they
might coordinate other intestinal responses to nutrient availability. Most EEC peptides signal via G-protein
coupled receptors which activate second messengers to modulate the function of their target cell. These
second messengers are intimately linked to ancient regulators of cellular metabolism, such as mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR), which are known to play essential roles in many intestinal functions. This
proposal will test the hypothesis that EECs regulate cellular metabolism in the stem cell niche (Aim 1) and in
the differentiated enterocyte (Aim 2), thus impacting both intestinal homeostasis and efficiency of nutrient
absorption. As EECs are now common targets for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, understanding how EECs
affect intestinal metabolism and function will inform how dietary or pharmacological manipulation of EECs will
impact gut health, nutrient absorption, and whole-body metabolism.
 To ensure success of the proposed research strategy, Dr. McCauley requires additional mentored time
to become fluent in metabolic and metabolomic assays. Dr. McCauley has obtained a co-mentor, Dr. Kenneth
Setchell, an international expert in using Mass Spectrometry to understand nutrition- and digestive disease-
related changes in metabolism. Dr. McCauley proposes a rigorous yet feasible schedule of formal and informal
training opportunities in metabolomics. At the conclusion of the mentored portion of her training, Dr. McCauley
will be established as a fully independent, leading young investigator in the field of gastrointestinal metabolism,
a critically understudied niche in the GI community."

The role of microglia in the C9orf72 (C9) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/ frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
disease spectrum remains poorly understood. Early investigations found that microglia activation was
significantly higher in ALS with dementia and impaired executive function, suggesting that microglia activation
correlates with FTD-like symptoms in ALS. More recent neuropathologic examinations of microglia in FTLD
patient autopsy brains with mutations in progranulin versus C9orf72 concluded that the observed microglia
dysfunction was different between the two genetically different patient subgroups suggesting specificity of
microglia dysfunction depending on the etiology of the patient population. One interesting aspect of microglia-
neuron communication is the role of microglia in the maintenance and refinement of synaptic networks through
the selective pruning of synapses, which occurs predominantly during development but has been shown to also
be triggered in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, including FTD. The degree of synapse loss in
AD strongly correlates with cognitive decline, even more than the amount of plaque, tangles or neuronal loss,
and a recent study of ALS postmortem tissue confirmed increased synapse loss in the prefrontal cortex of
patients with reported cognitive impairments. Our laboratory has preliminary data supporting the hypothesis that
there is an altered neural-immune interaction in the cortical forebrain regions of C9orf72 patients with
confirmed FTD in which microglia and neurons modify each other's function. Using patient-derived hiPSC
microglia and cortical neurons, we are able to show that C9 patient-derived hiPSC microglia mono-cultures do
have intrinsic phenotypes, including altered gene profiles, phagocytic activities and lysosomal function. Most
interestingly, preliminary data suggests that C9 microglia do regulate neuronal excitability and survival of C9
iPSC neurons. To further investigate the role and contribution of microglia in C9 cortical degeneration, we
propose to thoroughly investigate the intrinsic properties of C9 hiPSC-microglia (from all patient subgroups: FTD,
FTD/ALS, ALS; Aim1). For the first time, we will then co-culture these microglia with C9 and healthy control
hiPSC cortical neurons to better understand the co-regulation between these two cell types (Aim 2). Finally, in
the third aim, we will study microglia activation and pathology in C9 patient postmortem autopsy tissue. This will
include cell-type specific genetic profiling from existing snRNA seq data sets, immunohistochemistry of
microgliosis and multi-label immunostaining for microglial-specific candidate genes/proteins in conjunction with
C9 neuronal disease pathology markers (TDP-43 and C9 DPRs) to gain novel knowledge on whether microglia
are preferentially altered in close vicinity to neuronal pathologies."

This proposal investigates the role of the RNA helicase DDX5/p68 in regulating immune signaling pathways and
gene expression, as it relates to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). Our earlier studies demonstrated that DDX5 is a host restriction factor in HBV biosynthesis by a
mechanism not yet understood, that DDX5 is downregulated in HBV-related HCC with poor prognosis and in
response to multi-kinase inhibitors (mTKIs) used for the treatment of advanced HCC, and that DDX5 controls
STAT1 translation. Our RNAseq analyses of human liver cancer cell lines exhibiting DDX5 knockdown, identified
activation of Wnt and non-canonical NF-κB signaling, as downstream targets of DDX5.
 To gain further insight into the mechanism of DDX5 action in terms of virus biosynthesis and liver cancer
pathogenesis, we performed a proteomics (LC-MS/MS) study to identify cellular interacting partners of DDX5.
Surprisingly, our studies identified the Interferon gamma induced protein 16 (IFI16), a nuclear DNA sensor and
restriction factor for viruses that replicate in the nucleus, as the most prominent cellular factor interacting with
DDX5. A recent study has demonstrated that IFI16 binds the HBV minichromosome leading to inhibition of HBV
replication. However, HBV downregulates IFI16 expression as a strategy to escape innate immune surveillance
in chronically HBV infected patients. Significantly, the role of DDX5 in this interaction is currently unknown. Our
results based on chromatography of native nuclear extracts followed by label-free quantitative MS profiling show
that DDX5 and IFI16 co-eluted with auxiliary and core PRC2 subunits, HDAC1, 2 and DNMT1. This is consistent
with the prediction using the CORUM database, that DDX5/IFI16 interact with the MeCP1 complex, comprised
of histone deacetylases (HDACs) & DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs), and the chromatin silencing Polycomb
Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). Importantly, treatment of nuclear lysates with recombinant nuclease benzonase
reduced association of DDX5 with IFI16, suggesting involvement of an RNA in the formation of this complex.
However, the RNA substrate involved in formation of the DDX5/IFI16 complex is currently unknown.
 Based on these preliminary observations, we hypothesize that the DDX5/IFI16 complex represses viral
transcription, as well as cellular transcription of genes important for HCC progression. To address this hypothesis
we propose two independent specific aims focusing on key aspects of this mechanism:
 Aim1: To determine the antiviral effect of the epigenetic DDX5/IFI16 silencing complex.
Aim2: To determine the role of the DDX5/IFI16 complex in the expression of liver cancer genes.
Impact: Successful completion of this project will identify an essential mechanism as a therapeutic target for
silencing transcription from the HBV minichromosome, and reversing cellular gene expression changes
associated with poor prognosis HBV-related liver cancer."
10828864,"Cancer immunotherapy is one of the most important advances in cancer treatment in decades, and has rapidly
moved to front-line therapy for many cancers. The mechanism of cancer immunotherapy is to disable normal
immunoregulatory pathways through administration of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI), which are monoclonal
antibodies directed toward key immune regulatory proteins including PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4. Disabling these
pathways enhances anti-tumor immunity. However, since these responses are not tumor-specific, ICIs are
associated with a variety of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). We and others have recently reported a
high incidence of thrombosis, which may exceed 20%, in patients treated with ICI; given the increasing use of
ICIs in cancer treatment and the frequency of cancer diagnoses, it is clear that ICI-Cancer Associated
Thrombosis (ICI-CAT) has become a major clinical problem and that better understanding of this disorder is
urgently needed. However, there is little information available concerning mechanisms of ICI-CAT, and there are
no published studies addressing this issue. We hypothesize that ICI-CAT is an irAE resulting from ICI-induced
cellular activation and prothrombotic activity in the setting of underlying tumor-associated inflammation. Our
murine model demonstrates that ICI-CAT requires the presence of an underlying tumor, with markedly increased
expression of tumor cell tissue factor (TF) occurring after ICI treatment. Our model also supports a role for
neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and platelet activation in ICI-CAT; platelet activation is also suggested in
patients treated with ICI by our demonstration of increased levels of circulating platelet-neutrophil aggregates.
On a cellular level, anti-PD-1 antibodies stimulate neutrophil NET release and prothrombotic activity, and may
also enhance platelet activation in the presence of subthreshold thrombin concentrations. In this application, we
propose to advance our understanding of ICI-CAT using both cellular and animal models, and to extend these
studies to clinical samples from patients before and after initiating treatment with ICI. In Aim 1, we will determine
the effect of different ICI and ICI combinations on the development of thrombi in tumor-bearing mice, and assess
our model using other tumor types and mouse strains. We will examine thrombus size and composition, and
identify critical cell types involved in thrombus formation by depleting mice of T cells, neutrophils, monocytes or
platelets. We will also further define the cellular mechanisms involved in expression of prothrombotic activity
using isolated leukocytes from normal human donors, mixed leukocyte populations, and endothelial cells,
incubated with cytokines and ICI. In Aim 2, we will extend these studies by measuring mechanistic markers of
inflammation and vascular activation in patient plasma before and after initiating ICI, and by comparing
procoagulant gene expression in myeloid cells from patients treated with ICI who did, or did not develop
thrombosis. Taken together, these studies should provide important new information leading to better
understanding of mechanisms, and potentially new approaches for prevention and treatment of ICI-CAT."
10827969,"Summary
The vast number of inherited blinding disorders has made ocular gene therapy an active research field in recent
years, culminating in well-publicized clinical trials. However, efficacious therapies are still elusive for two
reasons: gene expression often remains inadequate in duration and levels, and the limited packaging capacity
of standard vectors prohibits the inclusion of disease genes with their cis-regulatory elements. Overcoming
these barriers is critical for the advancement of the field and widespread clinical application. Current gene
delivery strategies use cDNA-based vectors that lack the non-coding and cis-elements found in genomic DNA
that regulate gene expression. These genomic sequences can preserve the stability of the transcript, improve
translation and produce physiologically relevant levels of expression. In this application, we test the hypothesis
that providing the entire corrective gene including its authentic promoter, enhancer, introns and untranslated
regions (UTRs) improves the levels and duration of transgene expression in mouse model of RPE65-associated
Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA), a disease that affects the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). This disease
manifests in early childhood leading to a gradual vision loss often resulting in blindness. Due to the high
prevalence of RPE65-associated LCA, several clinical trials have been conducted using adeno-associated
viruses (AAV) to deliver human RPE65 cDNA. However, almost all attempts failed to halt the ongoing visual
loss. We thus aim to establish an effective therapeutic approach by delivering the whole human RPE65 gene
with its 5’/3’ regulatory elements, exons and introns to treat a mouse model of LCA (RPE65-/-). We aim to achieve
full regulation and long-term of expression in a cell-specific manner to ensure rescue of the LCA disease
phenotype. We have cloned the human RPE65 genomic fragment into an expression vector and will develop
an effective delivery platform utilizing naked DNA or DNA formulated as nanoparticles (NPs) with polylysine
peptides conjugated to polyethylene glycol (CK30PEG). We will test the longevity and levels of gene expression
after RPE65 delivery using these platforms, and evaluate their ability to mediate full phenotypic rescue in the
RPE65-/- mice. In aim1, we will engineer vectors that can achieve therapeutic levels of expression in the RPE
and in aim 2 we will evaluate long-term rescue and transduction efficiency in the RPE of the LCA model before
and after the onset of the disease phenotype. In summary, results from this application will facilitate the
advancement of non-viral gene therapy for RPE-associated diseases."
10892839,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The proposed work will investigate transcriptional interpretation of signaling through the ERK pathway, which
plays critical roles in animal development and is commonly deregulated in human diseases. We will use
Drosophila as an experimental model that offers unrivaled opportunities for dissecting gene regulation by ERK
signaling at multiple levels of biological organization, from specific ERK substrates to the whole embryo. Aim 1
focuses on Capicua (Cic), a transcriptional repressor that was discovered in Drosophila and has recently
emerged as a key sensor of ERK activation in developmental and pathological contexts. We will identify
functionally significant phosphorylation sites in Cic and investigate their effects on the ERK-dependent control of
Cic protein stability, nuclear localization, and DNA binding. Aim 2 is designed to bridge the gap between genetic
studies, which commonly identify only a handful of ERK substrates, and omics-level studies, which suggest that
ERK functions through large substrate cohorts. We will evaluate these two scenarios using an already working
combination of acute optogenetic perturbations, quantitative phosphoproteomics, and live imaging of functionally
significant transcriptional responses to ERK signaling. Finally, Aim 3 will study transcriptional effects of ERK
signaling, which commonly works by simultaneously activating some cell fates and repressing others. We will
use quantitative optogenetic perturbations and live imaging to test the hypothesis that activating and repressing
effects of ERK signaling require different levels of ERK activation. Our experimental tests of this hypothesis will
address a key issue in developmental ERK signaling and will provide quantitative data needed for predictive
computational modeling. Feasibility of the proposed work is supported by preliminary data that include functional
characterization of Cic phosphosites (Aim 1), a phosphoproteomics approach for the in vivo discovery of ERK
substrates (Aim 2), and an optogenetic approach to data-driven design of predictive computational models (Aim
3)."

Background. Falls occur in >50% patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), worsen participation in daily life and
increase healthcare costs. To date there are no established, accessible, tools to evaluate and reduce fall risk.
MS Falls InsightTrack is a live personal health library that combines a patient's falls-relevant clinical indicators
(from the electronic health record, EHR) with patient-generated data (PGD) from commercial wearables and
patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and community-level data (sociodemographics from UCSF Health Atlas
combined with MS-specific resources from the National MS Society). The tool will track falls/near-falls in real-
time and report changes in status that require intervention. It will offer customized action prompts to support fall
reduction through a behaviorally informed approach. It will be accessed in the clinic and in the patient's home.
Technological features. The tool will accessible, extensible and scalable. We will use modern technologies and
industry standards (e.g back-end: Python, flask framework, PostgreSQL; front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and
d3.js). The tool will launch from Epic via SMART on FHIR, and will communicate with patients using MyChart.
Qualifications of team and setting. The UCSF MS Center is a leading clinical research center in the digital
space. Our sub-leads are experts in all aspects of the study (digital technology, human-centered design,
implementation science, health literacy) with a varied and experienced Stakeholder Advisory Group.
Scientific plan. In Aim 1 (design), we will use a Human-Centered Design approach, engaging 20 patients with
MS, clinicians and stakeholders in a series of focus groups, to identify the critical data, devices, visualizations,
resources, workflows and accessibility/digital divide considerations for the tool, and the key interventions likely
to promote the COM-B model of behavioral change to reduce fall risk. Our key outcomes will be perceived
effectiveness, ease of use and likeability. In Aim 2 (evaluate feasibility), we will deploy MS Falls InsightTrack
in 100 diverse adults with MS who are at risk for falls. Participants will wear a Fitbit Ultra. The tool will be used
by patients in their homes and by clinicians during clinical encounters. We will use an implementation science
approach. Our key outcomes will be study retention, tool uptake and sustained use. We will explore impact on
fall risk. In Aim 3 (test generalizability) we will conduct focus groups with patients with other conditions where
falls are common (Orthopedics, Parkinson's Disease, Geriatrics) to understand additional data and design
features required to promote generalizability. Our key outcomes will parallel those in Aim 1.
Innovation and Broader Significance. MS Falls InsightTrack is a unique, comprehensive, accessible personal
health library that can be deployed in larger efficacy trials for falls reduction. Beyond this clinical use case, the
closed-loop approach of delivering PGD to the care system and back to the patient, interpreted and actionable,
using scalable technology, represents a significant innovation that can sequentially expand the number of
wearables, conditions and clinics in which patients and clinical investigators can ask their own questions of PGD."

There is a pressing need to support Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) patients by
identifying novel and modifiable risk factors that may reduce morbidity. Emerging evidence suggests that air
pollution – in particular fine particulate matter (PM2.5) – plays an important role in AD/ADRD pathogenesis.
However, little is known about the relative contributions of different air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, ozone), nor about
PM2.5 components. To facilitate the targeting of pollution control efforts, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS)
and the World Health Organization (WHO) have placed a high priority on determining which air pollutants and/or
which components of PM2.5 are most toxic. In addition, one major gap in the emerging epidemiologic evidence
on air pollution and AD/ADRD morbidity is that many previous studies have relied on hospitalizations as the
measure of morbidity. Yet, hospitalization is not the typical course for AD/ADRD diagnosis and initial treatment.
Instead, if it does occur for patients, hospitalization happens during the more advanced stages of the disease
and usually for treating complications of the disease. Thus, hospitalization records do not accurately reflect
disease incidence, and thus underestimate case numbers. Therefore, we propose a study that will leverage the
massive datasets of high-resolution environmental exposure data and Medicare claims (including doctor visits
where most AD/ADRD diagnoses would occur) across the contiguous US to better understand the influence of
air pollution on AD/ADRD morbidity among US elderly, and identify potential vulnerable subpopulations, with the
ultimate goal of informing environmental policy. We will (1) generate and validate a comprehensive, high-
resolution, multiple-species, air pollution dataset across the contiguous US for 2000-2021, including criteria air
pollutants (PM2.5 mass, NO2, and ozone), PM2.5 components (including trace metals), as well as aerosol water
and fine particle pH that may influence metal dissolution; (2) estimate the chronic effects of criteria pollutants
(PM2.5, NO2, and ozone) on AD/ADRD risks using the nationwide Medicare Chronic Conditions Warehouse
(CCW) database, which includes Medicare inpatient and outpatient claims, doctor visits, skilled nursing facility,
and home health-care claims for AD/ADRD among ~100 million Medicare beneficiaries; (3) assess the relative
contributions of PM2.5 components and potential effect modification by aerosol water/pH on AD/ADRD risks using
the nationwide Medicare cohort; and (4) conduct sensitivity analyses by correcting for exposure measurement
error and outcome misclassification. Our proposed research will fill major knowledge gaps in the epidemiology
of environmental exposures and AD/ADRD morbidity, and inform policy for targeted source-specific regulations
and facilitate actionable measures that can prevent or mitigate the AD health burden due to air pollution."
10862562,"Background: Overuse of health services whose immediate or downstream costs or harms exceed their
benefits (i.e., low-value health services) is a major driver of healthcare costs in the United States.
Comprehensive measures of low-value service use have been applied to identify low-value services with the
highest utilization and costs in non-VA populations, but less is known about which low-value services are most
frequently used and costly in Veterans managed in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Also, all
Veterans aged 65+ are eligible to use non-VA care via Medicare, and Veterans of all ages increasingly receive
care outside VA through VA Community Care (VACC). Past research suggests that dual use of VA and non-
VA care places Veterans at risk for overuse of health services, but information on Veterans’ use of low-value
services in non-VA settings is lacking. Significance/Impact: Our objective is to determine the extent of
utilization, costs, and determinants of Veterans' low-value service use within and outside VA. Our study will
identify the low-value services most commonly used by Veterans through VA Medical Centers (VAMCs),
VACC, and dual Medicare benefits, and those that are most costly. This study will inform policies and
interventions, including possible new quality metrics, to reduce low-value care provided to Veterans. Results
will be valuable to our VA partners (Office of Reporting, Analysis, Performance Improvement and Deployment,
and Office of Community Care) who are committed to ensuring that Veterans receive high-value services
regardless of where they receive care. It will also empower Veterans to consider value of care when choosing
between a VA vs non-VA setting. This study addresses two Veteran Care Priorities (health care value; quality/
safety of care) and the VA legislation priority to understand impact of non-VA care on value of care received by
Veterans in light of the MISSION Act. Innovation: Current VA performance metrics capture key dimensions of
access, quality, safety, and efficiency, but do not address Veterans' receipt of low-value care or quality of care
received in non-VA settings. Our project will use novel methods to quantify use and determinants of an array of
low-value services that Veterans may receive both within and outside of VA. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Quantify
utilization and costs of low-value services provided to VHA enrollees in VAMCs and VACC, and characterize
variation across VA facilities in low-value services provided in each setting. Aim 2: Quantify utilization and
costs of low-value services used by dual VHA-Medicare enrollees in VAMCs and non-VA settings through
Medicare, and characterize VA facility-level variation in low-value services provided in each setting. Aim 3:
Identify barriers and facilitators of de-implementing low-value services in each setting. Methodology: In Aim 1,
we will apply a claims-based measure of low-value care to VA utilization data and VACC data for a national
cohort of VHA enrollees. We will identify frequency of use of 26 low-value services in 6 categories: cancer
screening, diagnostic/preventive testing, preoperative testing, imaging, cardiovascular testing/procedures, and
surgery. We will apply average HERC cost estimates to calculate total costs of each service and category in
VAMCs and in VACC. We will use multilevel modeling to examine facility variation in rates of VAMC and VACC
low-value service use and extent to which Veteran and VAMC factors explain this variation. Aim 2 will involve
similar analyses involving VA utilization data and Medicare claims for dual VA-Medicare enrollees. Aim 3 will
apply latent profile analysis to facility-level estimates of low-value service categories to identify clusters of
VAMCs with similar patterns of low-value service use in VA and non-VA settings. We will conduct interviews
with VA providers who practice at VAMCs in different clusters to examine barriers and facilitators to de-
implementing low-value services for Veterans. Next Steps & Implementation: We will use results to work with
operations partners to develop performance measures, policies, and interventions to mitigate Veterans’ receipt
of low-value care in VA and non-VA settings, as VA evolves as a provider and payer of Veteran care."
10843799,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Reproduction is a systemic decision that relies on nutrient availability to support the high energetic cost
of gamete production and reproductive behaviors. Disorders that correlate with insufficient or excess body fat
mass like anorexia nervosa or polycystic ovarian syndrome are associated with decreased ovulation and infer-
tility. In humans and the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, steroid hormones are essential for reproduc-
tion, though the molecular cues that relay nutrient information to direct hormonal function are not well understood.
In Drosophila, activation of Ecdysone receptor (EcR) by the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) is re-
quired for oocyte maturation in the ovary. Interestingly, the transcription factor Cryptocephal (Crc), which is in-
duced by starvation via the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) pathway, interacts physically with EcR. This study
will examine how nutrient sensing alters reproductive capacity via ISR signaling and steroid hormones.
 I recently found that loss of crc in the fat body (FB), a liver-like and adipose-rich tissue in Drosophila,
caused follicle death and decreased lipid/yolk protein composition, defects associated with 20E dysregulation.
Additionally, loss of ISR factors caused excess retention of mature oocytes in the ovary. Together, my data
suggest that ISR signaling co-regulates oocyte maturation and egg laying behavior. During the training (K99)
phase of this award, I will uncover how Crc and EcR link metabolic status to gametogenesis and egg-
laying behavior. To this end, I am collaborating with Dr. Kafui Dzirasa at Duke University to adapt a novel neural
editing tool for use in Drosophila, creating artificial synapses to characterize regulation of egg laying by the ISR.
 Starvation, which activates the ISR, attenuates post-mating increases in intestinal function and courtship
behavior. During the independent (R00) phase, I will apply the insights and tools acquired during the
training phase to identify molecular cues downstream of ISR signaling that control nervous system and
gut functions to alter reproductive potential. First, I will determine how the ISR regulates female courtship
behavior, which requires inputs from central and peripheral neurons. Next, I will leverage the collaborations
forged during the K99 phase to characterize organism-wide expression of EcR- and Crc-responsive reporters
under different feeding conditions to interrogate the roles of Crc and EcR in the intestine, where both regulate
stem cell dynamics. This will open multiple lines of inquiry into how nutrient sensing controls multiple reproductive
events via ISR signaling and inter-organ crosstalk. My proposed studies will develop novel tools and insights
that will lay a strong foundation for my independent research program, wherein I will characterize diverse phys-
iological consequences of ISR and steroid hormone signaling in metabolic tissues and decipher how this impacts
behavior and whole-organism physiology. Ultimately, my work will reveal important insights into how metabolism
controls reproduction across organisms, which may lead to novel therapeutics for treating human metabolic
disorders that cause sex hormone dysregulation and infertility."
10838502,"Project Summary/Abstract
This four-year proposal for the K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award aims to further the
professional skills of the candidate Daniel E. Maidana, MD, PhD while addressing critical scientific inquiries
related to the contribution of mononuclear phagocytes to photoreceptor (PR) cell death in retinal detachment
(RD). The candidate's proposed career and scientific goals rely on the protected research time necessary to
master advanced laboratory methods and develop leadership skills under the guidance of an expert
multidisciplinary mentoring team. This collaborative work, which builds on prior research and established
mentoring relationships, will provide the basis for a successful and productive transition to independence.
The career advancement plan for the candidate, currently an Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology at the
University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), will consist of i) graduate-level courses in immunology, biostatistics,
transcriptomics, and bioinformatics, at UIC; ii) advanced laboratory technical and analytical methods, guided by
an expert Mentoring and Advisory Committee; iii) development of management and mentoring skills required to
lead a productive, independent laboratory. The institutional environment, departmental support, and cross-
disciplinary mentorship team will enable the candidate to maximize productivity during these four years. The
Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at UIC has a consistent record in transitioning early
physician-scientists to established independent investigators and strongly supports the candidate for this award.
The scientific goal of this proposal is to define the independent contribution of retinal microglia (MG) and blood-
derived monocytes/macrophages (Mø) to PR demise and vision loss in an experimental model of RD. Since MG
and Mø can either contribute to or resolve the initial injury, several therapeutic approaches have been recently
proposed to modulate these cells. However, recent work has unveiled technical limitations and a lack of
specificity in the methods used to ablate MG and Mø, thus limiting our understanding of their independent role
in promoting or reducing PR cell death. This goal will be accomplished using a novel inducible conditional
deletion model to i) define the role of MG in dead PR clearance in early RD; ii) dissect the contribution of MG
and Mø phenotypes to promote PR demise in late RD; and iii) determine the neuroprotective potential of MG
and Mø to rescue PR cell death following RD. The successful completion of this proposal will generate technical
and scientific advancements in our understanding of MG and Mø. We expect this work to provide mechanistic
insights to develop effective neuroprotective therapies, allowing us to maximize visual outcomes in the detached
retina to prevent vision loss."
11162104,"ABSTRACT
Poorly defined fitness features enable a subset of cancer cells to survive therapy, ultimately giving rise to
treatment-refractory tumors. The expanded use of sequencing tools have led to the recognition that refractory
tumors often lack a genetic mechanism of resistance, and instead co-opt a regenerative program characterized
by activation of developmental, inflammatory, mesenchymal and stem cell features. Importantly, these
regenerative states are conserved across diverse cancers of epithelial origin, and are potentially reversible. Our
preliminary data indicate that therapy resistance in colorectal cancer (CRC) is fueled by preexisting cells via a
YAP-driven regenerative program that is strikingly similar to the consensus molecular subtype 4 of CRC, a poor
risk phenotype often observed in treatment-refractory tumors.
Our central hypothesis is that a preexisting population drives regenerative reprogramming and tumor escape
through epigenetic adaptations that can be targeted therapeutically. First we propose characterizing the
preexisting (pre-resistant) state using barcode lineage tracing and single-cell technologies. Using patient-derived
organoids (PDOs) to isolate the founding clones of resistance, we will study the contribution of preexisting versus
actively gained fitness features through whole-exome (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Using pre-clinical
models of resistance to KRAS-inhibition (KRASi), we will define the role of genetic and non-genetic drivers of
tumor escape. To develop approaches that abrogate regenerative reprogramming, we will perform a focused
shRNA screen targeting 50 chromatin regulators. To expedite clinical translation, we will test readily available
compounds targeting the top hits of the screen, in combination with standard therapies. We believe that our
innovative tools will maximize our opportunity to develop treatment approaches with immediate clinical impact.
During the award period, the candidate will conduct research at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) and Memorial
Sloan Kettering (MSK) under the mentorship of Dr. Lukas Dow and an advisory committee. The candidate will
commit at least 9 person-months of his professional effort to the research and career development activities
outlined here. With his mentor and advisory committee, the candidate has designed a 5-year plan aimed at
expanding his knowledge and expertise in cancer research, including single cell technologies, computational
biology, genetic engineering, and functional screens. The goal of the career plan is to launch an independent
career as a laboratory investigator focused on therapy resistance and biomarkers of response in CRC."
10840971,"Project Abstract: A neurocomputational model of age-related differences in
navigation
For many individuals, navigation skills decline with increasing age, particularly for novel
environments with which the individual is not already highly familiar. Impairments in
navigation are particularly evident for those with mild cognitive impairment, a significant
risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s related dementia (ADRD). Yet, our
understanding of age-related differences in navigation remains underdeveloped. The
dominant explanation for age-related differences in navigation relates to impairments in
the cognitive map, yet the explanatory capabilities of this model are limited, particularly
in explaining the heterogeneity of age-related differences in navigation. Here, we seek
to develop a novel computational model that employs an approximate Bayesian
framework to better account for age-related differences in navigation. We focus in
particular on testing hypotheses related to greater reliance on multimodal cue integration
(Aim 1) and strategy rigidity (Aim 2) in older adults. These ideas will be tested using
highly immersive virtual reality in which participants don a head-mounted display and
free ambulate hallways. The experiment in Aim 1 will provide critical tests of our
computational model by employing conditions involving both matching and mismatching
visual and idiothetic (body-based) cues. This will allow us to test Aim 1 and whether
older adults rely on multimodal integration to a greater extent than younger adults. The
experiment in Aim 2 will test whether older adults rely on previous trials to a greater
extent than younger adults, particularly for matching and mismatching trials. This will
allow us to test the extent to which older adults might show strategy rigidity by over-
relying on past trials. Aim 1&2 will also allow us to test ideas related to individual
differences in navigation strategies, which can be assessed based on the variability in
subject responses within the different conditions tested. Finally, we will test a subset of
individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to provide initial and exploratory testing
of their navigational deficits in our experiments. The outcomes of this project have the
potential to provide a new understanding of age-related differences in navigation by
developing a sophisticated and novel computational model that we test in detail with
experiments in immersive virtual reality."
10920481,"ABSTRACT
In this R21 application, we propose to develop a universal, intranasal, parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5)-based
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) bivalent vaccine. RSV and HMPV are
two of the leading causes of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in children, immunocompromised individuals,
and the elderly. Illness ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia, with 90-100%
of children infected with RSV by 2 years of age, and HMPV between the ages of 5-10 years old. No licensed
RSV or HMPV vaccine is available and there is an unmet medical need to develop safe and effective vaccines
for both diseases. A recent proof-of-principle study has shown that it is possible to create a chimeric F protein
(RHMS-1) by combining immunodominant epitopes from RSV F and HMPV F that retains antigenicity for both
viruses, the purified protein is immunogenic and protective against RSV and HMPV challenge in mice. However,
this purified protein requires an adjuvant and a multi-dose approach, the cell-mediated immune response was
not studied, the duration of the antibody response has not been determined, and there is a potential safety
concern for children due to the high dose of protein required for the vaccine to be immunogenic. PIV5 is a safe
delivery vector for intranasal immunization. A PIV5-vectored RSV candidate vaccine (BLB-201) has already been
cleared by the FDA for a phase I clinical trial this year (NCT05281263). Due to the similarities between RSV and
HMPV F proteins, disease manifestation, and target populations, a bivalent vaccine is desirable to protect against
ARI diseases caused by both viruses. Here, we propose to introduce the RHMS-1 novel sequence into the PIV5-
vectored vaccine platform. We will also make a modification to the RHMS-1 sequence to improve F protein
expression and its immunogenicity. The constructs to be evaluated include: 1) RHMS-1 pre-fusion; and 2)
RHMS-1 pre-fusion form with the trimerization domain replaced with the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic
tail from the PIV5 F protein. The candidate vaccine viruses will be compared for their replication and antigen
expression in vitro, and immunogenicity and protective efficacy against RSV and HMPV challenge infection in
vivo. The novelty of the vaccine proposed in this R21 application relates to: 1) the use of a chimeric RSV+HMPV
F protein against two pathogens (bivalent vaccine); 2) a needle-free intranasal delivery method in a safe, highly
immunogenic viral vector; 3) ease of administration; and 4) the ability to induce cellular and antibody responses
including mucosal immunity, which is necessary for protecting against respiratory pathogens. The project is very
promising in generating an effective bivalent vaccine that could provide protection against the two leading causes
of acute lower respiratory tract infections in children and older adults."
10845570,"Genome-wide research strategies provide unprecedented opportunities for insight but also
major bioinformatic challenges due to the size and complexity of the data. The multidisciplinary
research in this TBRU utilizes cutting-edge research methods that utilize a broad spectrum of
‘omics platforms, including proteomics, genomics (RNA-seq), genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) of the host and pathogen, cellular experimental screens with host and pathogen data,
and targeted model organism experiments. Integration of these datasets and research
strategies requires innovative approaches to mechanistically examine how Mtb and host genetic
variants modulate TB pathogenesis. Core B uses pathway-driven and cutting-edge
bioinformatics approaches to integrate the genetic results from Core A with multiple large-scale
and diverse datasets from each project (proteomics, Path-Seq, RNAseq) to dynamically identify
and prioritize pathways and protein networks for functional testing. While each of these
experiments are analyzed individually within each project, the results have potential for greater
insight beyond each dataset. Core B represents a key source of synergy as data will flow
between all the Projects and Cores and will generate models leading to targeted experiments
with an iterative analytic and hypothesis testing process. This Core will bring together expertise
across the Projects for the different ‘omic platforms as well as bioinformatic strategies for data
integration. Aim 1 provides integrated analyses of the diverse datasets from Core A and each
Project. Aim 2 utilizes network propagation, a systems biology method applied to diverse
disease areas, which uses networks to identify convergent pathways highlighted by distinct
omics-level datasets. This method is useful when the individual gene overlap between studies is
poor, while genes from distinct studies do possess pathway/functional overlap with one another.
Here we apply it to study phenotypic variation in human TB and use it as an independent
method to extract insights and new disease gene targets from the diverse and complex datasets
of this consortium. The overall goal is to generate models from data integration that prioritize
research directions across the Projects and Core A and create testable mechanistic
hypotheses that are iteratively assessed between Core B and all TBRU components."
10845573,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a multifaceted disease that has extensive variation in clinical manifestations despite being
the product of infection with a single pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The extensive genetic diversity in
human and Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes responsible for differences in clinical outcomes represent
modifications of host-pathogen interactions that are key to pathogenesis. Understanding the basis for these
heterogenous responses will uncover new mechanisms of virulence and resistance and will impact treatment
and diagnostics. Unfortunately, the challenges of studying the mechanisms of differential outcomes of infection
in humans not only includes identification of correlations between host/pathogen genotypes with phenotypes in
human populations, but also the subsequent identification of the mechanisms that are causal for disease which
require studying them in the laboratory without the pathogen’s natural host organism. This Program takes
advantage of unique, ongoing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that have identified both human and
pathogen variants that are associated with heterogenous clinical responses in two different human populations.
To determine the mechanisms underlying these variations, we will employ a powerful set of experimental
assays, including new proteomics-based scanning platform to probe host responses during experimental
macrophage infection that is orthogonal to traditional mRNA profiling, in order to broadly search for changes in
host innate immune pathways that correlate with disease outcomes associated with these clinical strains.
Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that many of these interactions occur early during infection and
are mediated by proteins secreted by M. tuberculosis. In this proposal, we focus primarily on correlations
between two unique sets of clinical bacterial variants, strains that are associated greater transmission of
pulmonary TB disease and strains that are more prone to dissemination to distal sites in the body. An
unexpected theme from both of these sets of strains is the prevalence of TB proteins secreted by the ESX
systems expressed in M. tuberculosis. Both the ESX-1 and ESX-5 secretion systems of M. tuberculosis are
key virulence determinants required for intracellular growth and for eliciting distinct innate immune responses
during macrophage infection. A central hypothesis is that the set of bacterial proteins that influence disease
outcomes are enriched for secreted proteins that mediate interactions between pathogen and host
macrophages. To test this hypothesis, we will collaborate with Cores A and B to use an integrative approach
to combine genetic data from the M. tuberculosis GWAS datasets with genetic and proteomic screen to identify
causal genes that mediate interactions with macrophages. We will use these same technologies to collaborate
with Projects 2 and 3 to identify proteins/pathways responsible for host resistance and bacterial
dissemination."
10845578,"Variation in clinical outcomes after Mtb exposure ranges from resistance to infection to disseminated disease.
Human genetic and cellular mechanisms of resistance and dissemination are largely unknown and may
provide insight into novel therapeutic strategies. In Vietnam, we enrolled and examined large cohorts of PTB
and TBM subjects with detailed immunogenetic studies of both the host and pathogen to discover determinants
of disease progression. In Uganda in a large TB household contact study over the past 20 years, we found
that ~9% of close adult household contacts remained persistently TST and Interferon- Release Assay (IGRA)
negative during extended follow-up and appear to be resistant to traditionally defined LTBI (RSTR). With
transcriptional and proteomic profiling of Mtb-infected monocytes, we discovered genes and pathways that are
enriched in RSTR compared to LTBI. Some genes were differentially enriched in both datasets, including
RAB11B, a gene involved in vesicle trafficking, which was increased in RSTR macrophages and also identified
in the human-M. tuberculosis protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Furthermore, with a cellular GWAS
approach in Mtb-infected macrophages, we discovered human polymorphisms associated with IL-1β
expression that are in genes not previously known to regulate IL-1. These findings suggest new genes and
variants that globally regulate human Mtb induced IL-1β, a key cytokine that promotes control of Mtb in
macrophages and in murine in vivo models. In genetic association studies in RSTRs & LTBI (Uganda) and
TBM & PTB (Vietnam), we found polymorphisms in several candidate genes (associated with RSTR or TB
disease or macrophage IL-1 regulation) that were strongly associated with clinical outcomes. Together, these
data support our hypothesis that Mtb-induced macrophage responses are genetically regulated and associated
with different clinical outcomes. However, there are many gaps in our knowledge. First, the Mtb-induced post-
translational modification (PTM) profiles of macrophages from RSTR, LTBI, and TB disease individuals are
unknown. Second, the global human genetic regulators (genes and variants) of Mtb-induced macrophage anti-
microbial pathways are mostly unknown. Third, molecular and cellular mechanisms of human Mtb resistance
and dissemination are almost completely unknown, including the role of Mtb strain variation in pathogenesis.
To address these gaps, we will use genomic, genetic, and proteomic methods to profile human macrophages
and discover differentially abundant PTMs that are associated with clinical outcomes and/or are Mtb strain
dependent. We will then use genetic and cellular strategies to discover the global regulators of anti-microbial
macrophage responses to Mtb infection and examine how these genes and their variants regulate macrophage
function in the context of Mtb strain variation. Our primary goal is to discover new vulnerabilities between Mtb
and macrophages, and thus inform mechanisms of disease heterogeneity, insights into risk stratification for
clinical management, and development of effective host directed therapies and vaccines."
10845583,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly heterogeneous human disease that develops in some, but not all,
individuals who inhale 1-3 infectious bacilli of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). TB disease can
range from pulmonary disease that is mild and self-resolving, to severe, or can disseminate to
extrapulmonary sites. Understanding the complexity of TB pathogenesis requires a holistic
approach that integrates human and animal model studies. Although there is growing evidence
that Mtb strain-dependent factors drive different infection outcomes, the in vivo mechanisms that
govern these outcomes are poorly understood. In this project, we start with clinical Mtb strains
associated with different pathogenic outcomes (e.g., high transmission or disseminated disease)
or mutant strains harboring modifications in gene candidates, identified in Core A and Project
1, to identify polymorphisms in Mtb strains associated with distinct human clinical outcomes.
Mice infected with these clinical or mutant Mtb strains will be used to investigate how they
govern three distinct stages of pathogenesis: 1) establishing infection at the site of aerosol
inhalation, 2) dissemination to distant sites, and 3) interactions with host immunity in distinct
lung macrophage populations. These studies will leverage our group’s recent advances in
mouse TB models, including identifying the earliest cellular events after aerosol Mtb infection,
tracking Mtb dissemination using a physiologic, ultra low-dose (ULD) infection model in which
mice are infected with 1-3 CFUs of aerosolized Mtb, and assessing paired host and Mtb
transcriptomes in distinct pulmonary macrophage types. Multiparameter confocal microscopy
and advanced quantitative image analysis will be used to determine how these Mtb strain-
dependent factors shape immune cell interactions at infection sites. The overall goal of the
proposed experiments is to gain insight into molecular and cellular mechanisms of pathogenesis
at distinct stages of Mtb infection to inform development of novel host- and pathogen-directed
interventions."
10840959,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ultrafast FLASH radiation therapy dosimetry is an unsolved clinical and engineering problem. The goal of this
research is to develop a first-of-its-kind pulse-resolved ultrafast radiation detector prototype based on
innovative low-gain-avalanche-detector (LGAD) technology and ultrafast electronics for FLASH radiation
therapy dosimetry. Our recent work published in Physics in Medicine and Biology demonstrates that, for the
first time, LGAD sensors with associated ultrafast readout electronics (International patent number
WO2019232172A1) developed at the University of Kansas (KU) can measure charged particle fluences with
high speed and spatial precision. The system has been tested with a medical LINAC where single particles
were measured with a time resolution of 50 picoseconds. The integrated response is as accurate as a standard
ionization chamber but with a spatial resolution twenty times finer and a temporal resolution over 100 million
times better with the capability to measure the charges deposited by a single LINAC pulse. The unprecedented
resolving power allows the structure of the commonly known 3-microsecod LINAC pulses to be viewed and,
most strikingly, the 350-picosecond sub-pulses in the train to be reconstructed. This project is in response to
PAR-19-150 which seeks to encourage quantitative and physical scientists to work with biomedical
researchers to catalyze the use of bioengineering approaches for their potential to open new areas of
biomedical investigation. We aim to 1) design and build a LGAD dosimetry prototype, both a single-element
and a 16-element array with a 1-cm pitch, and 2) determine if the prototypes can function as an ultrafast and
proportional dose measurement device. This proof-of-concept study provides an innovative method for FLASH
dosimetry that has the potential to expand dose measurement capability from milliseconds to microseconds
and even to nanoseconds. The ultrafast detectors can be used by the radiation biologists for accurate dose
estimations in preclinical animal studies, by FLASH system vendors to allow their use in a safety feedback
system that could stop a beam during treatment, and by the clinical medical physicists to function as a two-
dimensional detector array for both FLASH delivery commissioning and patient-specific quality assurance and
quality control."

Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus transmitted by
mosquitoes and is responsible for periodic epizootic/epidemic outbreaks of encephalitis in both horses and
humans. The innate and interferon (IFN) responses are critical barriers for preventing the replication and spread
of many viral pathogens including alphaviruses such as VEEV. As a result, viruses have evolved diverse
mechanisms to inhibit or escape the innate immune response as well as antiviral effectors such as IFN-stimulated
genes (ISGs). RNA structures are known to regulate basic viral processes (e.g. viral RNA transcription and
translation), however, the role that viral RNA structure plays in shaping innate immune responses to viruses is
understudied. We have previously shown that alphaviruses encode stable structures within their 5’-untranslated
region (5’-UTR) that are critical for antagonizing IFIT1, an ISG important in restriction of non-self RNA. We have
also shown that RNA structures in the 3’-UTR are important in modulating recognition of viral RNA by IFIT2.
Recently we have shown that RNA structures in the 3’-UTR and E1 modulate replication of virulent and avirulent
VEEV in macrophages, which are important targets of VEEV infection in vivo. The broad objectives of this
proposal are to: 1) delineate E1 RNA structural determinants in virulent and avirulent VEEV that regulate
macrophage replication, 2) define how E1 structural determinants recruit RBPs to the viral genome and the
impact of this on host innate immune responses, 3) Define how macrophage replication fitness contributes to
the differential pathogenesis in vivo of VEEV encoding virulent and avirulent RNA structures, and 4) Define how
macrophage replication fitness shapes innate immune responses in vivo. Findings from these studies will provide
key insight into novel mechanisms of VEEV pathogenesis and emergence of pathogenic variants. This will have
broad implications for our understanding of viral emergence and development of RNA-based therapeutics."

Summary
Using a comprehensive machine learning analysis of coronary artery calcifications and thoracic fat depots in
CT calcium score images, we will predict future major adverse cardiovascular events. Improved characteriza-
tion of cardiovascular risk will advance knowledge of cardiometabolic disease phenotypes and support clinical
therapeutic decision-making and patient counseling for improved adherence. With improved risk prediction and
identification of high-risk phenotypes, there will be an opportunity to guide precision preventive therapies,
where guidance is needed given the cost and side effects associated with some of these therapies. The Agat-
ston calcium score is the leading predictor of a future major adverse cardiovascular event, better than any oth-
er single assessment. Epicardial fat volume and HU values are independent risk factors. We will combine
analyses of fat and calcifications in CT calcium score exams in an unprecedented way. For coronary calcifica-
tions, pathological observations and preliminary results suggest that examining other features (calcium-omics)
can improve prediction as compared to whole-heart Agatston. Our assessments will characterize small, spotty,
low-density calcifications, providing a better surrogate of disease vulnerability than Agatston, which is numeri-
cally dominated by large, likely stable, calcifications. In addition to fat volumes, we will examine quantitative
texture and shape features (fat-omics). Elevated HU values and tissue textures are indicative of fat inflamma-
tion. All these observations suggest significant value in a combined fat-omics and calcium-omics analysis. We
will use large archives of CT calcium score exams from different sites, including University Hospitals of Cleve-
land, which is an institution with the largest no-charge CT calcium scoring program (>13,000 scans per year).
These big data repositories provide a unique machine-learning opportunity. Numerous technical innovations
are planned, including novel features, data representations, and machine learning approaches. In addition to
clinical risk prediction, our CT calcium score analyses will dovetail in the future with many research interests,
including the role of genes, metabolomics, co-morbidities (e.g., diabetes and psoriasis), socio-economic status,
and cardio-oncology on cardiovascular risk."
10843188,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genome editors, technologies to modify the genomes of living cells, have extraordinary potential to become
safe and effective genomic medicines, direct treatments for the underlying cause of genetic diseases such as
sickle cell disease and many others. However, as gene therapy products with novel mechanisms of action, there
remains a need for optimized and qualified biochemical IND-enabling assays to assess their safety. We and
others have developed sensitive and unbiased research methods for defining the genome-wide activity of editors
such as CHANGE-seq and GUIDE-seq. However, they require further optimization and characterization as fit-
for-purpose assays to fulfill rigorous regulatory requirements for investigational new drug (IND) submissions.
Surprisingly, to our knowledge there are no published methods for high-throughput sequencing characterization
of gRNA identity and purity. Thus, there remain urgent unmet needs for publicly available, optimized, and
qualified IND-enabling assays to characterize critical genome editing reagents and their associated on- and off-
target genome-wide activities. We, therefore, propose the following specific aims: 1) Optimize and qualify
CHANGE-seq as IND-enabling biochemical genome-wide activity assay, and 2) Optimize and qualify gRNA
sequencing as IND-enabling assay to assess genome editing component identity and purity, and 3) Collaborate
to test CHANGE-seq and gRNA sequencing in therapeutic contexts. We anticipate that fulfilling the need for
well-characterized assays to identify impurities in critical reagents or characterize key quality attributes of
genome editing drug products will have positive impact to accelerate the translation of novel, safe, and effective
therapeutic genome editing therapeutic strategies to first-in-human clinical trials."
10914152,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a leading cause of death in the United States; and there is
~2-fold greater risk for CVD events for people living with HIV (PLWH).1,2 The mechanisms underlying
increased CVD prevalence in PLWH are not fully understood, but likely involve heightened activation of
monocytes and macrophages. We hypothesize that monocytes will be exposed to disparate inflammatory
signals during differentiation in PLWH; as a result, macrophages will be functionally and phenotypically
different and exacerbate CVD in this population. Our data suggest that alterations in the lipidome may
influence inflammation, monocyte activation, and the differentiation of macrophages. Antiretroviral therapy may
alter lipid profiles by reducing oxidative phosphorylation (OxPHOS) and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) as a
consequence of ART-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Our studies have identified differences in the
lipidomes of HIV- and HIV+ populations, even when traditional lipid panels in these groups were similar22.
Biomarkers associated with CVD risk (IL-6, sCD14, TNFR1),10-15 were directly related to fatty acid composition
and pro-inflammatory lipid classes in PLWH. We have also identified an expansion of pro-coagulant, vascular
homing monocytes in PLWH42-44 and linked monocyte activation to altered lipid profiles19,20,45-47.
Aim 1: To identify unique and common phenotypic, transcriptomic, and functional MDM profiles
associated with the presence or absence of ASCVD in PLWH and HIV- individuals.
1A: To compare MDM phenotypic, functional, and transcriptomic profiles across our 4 groups.
1B: To sort and differentiate monocyte subsets (based on CD14 and CD16 expression)43,49,50 into MDMs in
order to determine whether subset origin determines differential functional and phenotypic outcome.
1C: To sort macrophages from atherosclerotic plaques (carotid endarterectomies) and compare the
transcriptional profiles of these cells to the profiles identified in MDMs from our 4 participant groups.
Aim 2: To characterize drivers of MDM activation in PLWH and HIV- persons with and without ASCVD.
2A: To characterize the plasma lipid profiles of participants using advanced lipidomics (Lipidyzer) as well as
the lipidomic profiles of atherosclerotic plaques collected from carotid endarterectomies.
2B: To explore the consequences of in vivo and in vitro lipid profile modulation on MDM gene expression and
functional capabilities; statin treatment will improve the lipidome51 and as a consequence, decrease MDM
activation, and in vitro exposure of MDMs to proinflammatory lipids (i.e CERs, SaFAs) will activate these cells.
2C: To determine the drug-specific effects of ART exposure on MDM profiles.
Aim3: To elucidate profiles associated with ASCVD in HIV- and HIV+ individuals using a
comprehensive, multi-dimensional approach and in vitro pathway inhibitor experiments to explore
differential drivers and inhibitors of signaling cascades on MDM transcription and functional profiles."
10899671,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Atrial fibrillation ablation is the most common procedure performed in electrophysiology laboratories and
continues to grow more rapidly than any other EP procedure. A recent NHLBI report highlighted the research
needs and priorities for catheter ablation of AF, emphasizing the importance of real-world evidence and the
lack of longitudinal, multi-center, data collection platforms to inform patients and healthcare providers. The
current proposal seeks to merge two extant resources to help fulfill those needs: the AF Ablation National
Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) and the NIH-supported Eureka mobile health research platform. The AF
Ablation NCDR is a well-established quality assessment tool currently already in operation in 200 institutions
around the US, utilizing comprehensive and carefully vetted and regularly audited data collection forms to
ascertain detailed information regarding patient, procedure, and institution-level information. However, the AF
Ablation NCDR does not capture longitudinal information regarding procedural effectiveness, safety, or patient
reported outcomes. Eureka, co-developed and run by the proposed PI of the current project, is a digital
infrastructure built to facilitate mobile health-based research, providing established workflows to obtain remote
consent, actively engage with and collect information directly from research participants via a mobile app,
employ technical integrations to passively collect data from smartphones, and utilizes a reliable and secure
backend database to curate and transmit the resultant data. We propose to co-enroll AF Ablation NCDR
patients into a customized Eureka tenant, enabling longitudinal data collection in a pragmatic fashion. While
the overarching goal of this project will be to leverage these efforts to efficiently construct a resource available
for multiple secondary analyses, ancillary projects, and future projects for interested investigators, we will
demonstrate the utility of the merged infrastructure to pursue three immediately clinically relevant Aims.
 In Aim 1, we will determine the relative influences of patient-level, procedural-level, and institution-level
characteristics as predictors of AF Ablation effectiveness and risk in this multi-center, real-world, prospective
cohort, specifically testing the hypotheses that female sex, cryoablation (rather than radiofrequency ablation),
and procedures performed in non-teaching hospitals will each be associated with reduced effectiveness and
more frequent complication. In Aim 2, we will seek to determine how lifestyle factors may influence AF Ablation
outcomes, specifically testing the hypothesis that reduced alcohol consumption after ablation is associated with
greater effectiveness. In Aim 3, we will seek to demonstrate how this large multi-center database may be
useful in characterizing rare but especially clinically relevant complications, specifically to describe the
incidence and predictors of atrioesophageal fistula. Taken together, we will work to create a practically useful
platform that cultivates original research to inform optimal approaches to AF ablation procedures in the real
world."
10886564,"Abstract
Skeletal muscle wasting (SMW) is a growing burden among cancer survivors and is prognostic of treatment
failure, radiotherapy toxicity, and a shorter time to tumor progression related to survival. This is of particular
concern for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), for whom interventions for severe
SMW are now being implemented prior to surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, so that these patients can
complete their prescribe treatments. Currently, the mechanism(s) that lead to cancer-related SMW have
yet to be elucidated. Furthermore, viable treatment options for patients with this multifactorial syndrome
remain undiscovered. A lack of preclinical models that recapitulate human disease is often identified as an
obstacle in the development of feasible therapies to treat cancer-related SMW. To this end, our lab
developed a murine model of PDAC-related SMW that parallels human pathology and can be longitudinally
assessed via Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA). In this murine model of PDAC we have identified
upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, immune cell infiltration, IGFBP-3, and intramuscular
adipogenesis as key features in the progression of SMW. In addition, we determined that a single
intratumoral injection of IL-12 reduced tumor burden, pro-inflammatory signaling, and SMW, while
improving survival out to 50 days. Although a relationship between chronic low grade inflammation and
PDAC-related SMW has been suggested, the mechanisms are unknown. Also, the relationship betwe en
macrophage associated increases in IGFBP-3 and adipogenesis have yet to be investigated. Thus, the
purpose of this proposal is to investigate a novel pathway of SMW and increased intramuscular
adipogenesis via pathologic increases in IGFBP-3 by tumor and immune cells. In addition, we seek to
determine the efficacy of a multi-dose IL-12 treatment regimen to ameliorate SMW through the reduction
of inflammation, intramuscular macrophage infiltration, IGFBP-3 secretion, and adipogenesis in a murine
model of PDAC."
10913332,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate of all cancers, with a 5-year survival rate of only 9%. Surgery
still represents the only curative treatment option, though less than 20% of patients are candidates for resection.
Approximately 30-40% of patients present with locally advanced unresectable tumors with no significant chance
of long-term survival through standard treatments. The use of ablative radiation doses (biologically equivalent
doses of 100Gy) produces results that are comparable to surgical resection in patients with inferior prognostic
features. However, organ motion, due to respiratory motion, must be managed to minimize toxicity in the
gastrointestinal tract. In this project, we will develop novel real-time volumetric MRI technology that can guide
radiotherapy to enable the use of ablative doses with minimal risk. Our technique, called MR SIGnature Matching
(MRSIGMA), pre-learns 3D motion states and assigns unique motion signatures during an offline learning phase
and performs fast signature acquisition and matching during an online matching phase. We have demonstrated
real-time tracking of liver tumors with an imaging latency (acquisition plus reconstruction) of about 250 ms using
MRSIGMA. We will collaborate with Elekta to implement MRSIGMA on the Unity MR-Linac system and to link
the output of MRSIGMA with the multileaf collimator (MLC) system to enable the radiation beam to track the 3D
position and shape of the moving tumor in real-time. Specific Aims are as follows:
1. Develop deep learning reconstruction of undersampled dynamic MRI data for rapid motion database
 generation during offline learning and adaptation during online matching
 a. Develop a convolutional neural network for rapid reconstruction of motion-resolved data (< 10 seconds)
 b. Detect anatomical changes, such as motion baseline drifts, and adapt the motion database accordingly
 c. Perform initial validation on a dynamic MRI phantom and ten volunteers
2. Validate the potential of MRSIGMA for real-time volumetric tumor motion imaging on fifty patients with locally
 advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer
 a. Accuracy hypothesis: real-time MRSIGMA is noninferior to a non-real-time XDGRASP reference
 b. Reproducibility hypothesis: two MRSIGMA scans present equivalent real-time imaging performance
3. Develop and validate on dynamic phantoms the proposed MRSIGMA-guided MLC tracking in collaboration
 with Elekta
 a. Develop software to control the MLC with the output of MRSIGMA
 b. Evaluate tracking latency, geometric error, reproducibility and dosimetric accuracy"
10886544,"Project Summary
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is almost universally lethal and is projected to become the
second-leading cause of cancer related deaths in the US by 2030. Conventional (genotoxic) chemotherapy
approaches that make up the current standard of care are mostly ineffective and prolong survival of advanced
PDAC patients by less than one year on average. Similarly, small molecule drugs targeting aberrantly activated
oncogenic signaling pathways have shown disappointing clinical results and accordingly have failed to gain
FDA approval for PDAC. An alternative strategy to these two approaches is to exploit metabolic dependencies
that are unique to malignant cells by virtue of their deranged cellular metabolism.
 While there are well-characterized resistance mechanisms to genotoxic and targeted therapies, deprivation
of certain nutrients critical for proliferation of malignant cells appears to be an insurmountable barrier for cancer
progression. However, cells have redundant means of acquiring these critical nutrients, and so inhibition of a
single metabolic enzyme is generally not sufficient to deny them to cancer cells. Thus, combinatorial blockade
of multiple metabolic pathways could be required to impose deficiency of key metabolites on malignant cells.
 Pyrimidine nucleotides represent a class of metabolites that has been shown in numerous studies to be
essential for PDAC and a host of other malignancies. Importantly, there are several clinical grade inhibitors of
pyrimidine synthesis enzymes that have shown preclinical promise as anticancer agents. However, these
drugs have uniformly failed to show efficacy in clinical trials in which they were used as monotherapy against
various malignancies. One potential explanation for this is that there are two major pathways by which cells
generate nucleotides, termed the de novo and salvage pathways, and these inhibitors block the key de novo
pathway enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), thus leaving the salvage pathway fully intact.
 We’ve characterized the response of various PDAC cell lines to the DHODH inhibitor brequinar (BQ). We
found that some PDAC cell lines are highly resistant to BQ in cell viability assays compared to their more
sensitive counterparts. We then screened some 350 known kinase inhibitor compounds to probe for any that
could restore BQ sensitivity in our resistant PDAC cell lines, and this nominated the preclinical BTK inhibitor
CNX-774 as the strongest hit. Follow-up studies have shown that combined BQ/CNX-774 treatment leads to
profound cell viability loss and pyrimidine depletion, compared to either drug alone, in BQ-resistant PDAC
cells. Furthermore, we have strong evidence that CNX-774 is acting in an off-target manner to inhibit
pyrimidine salvage. Thus, the goal of this study is to uncover the mechanism by which CNX-774 is sensitizing
PDAC cells to BQ and determine if this drug combination is efficacious in our preclinical PDAC mouse models.
Our goal is to provide preclinical support for this metabolic combination therapy as a potential PDAC treatment."
10909019,"Lupus is predominantly a female disease, however men with lupus frequently have more severe symptoms and
organ involvement including cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death in lupus. Environmental and
gender differences such as sunlight exposure and vitamin D levels have also been shown to play a role in lupus
progression and cardiovascular disease. Differences in metabolic activity have also been suggested to contribute
to sexually dimorphic immune responses and autoimmunity. Our recent data in female lupus combining cardiac
imaging with metabolomic profiling has shown potential links between cardiac involvement and metabolic
reprogramming of lupus monocytes. This proposal investigates the hypothesis that sex biases in metabolic
activity of monocytes drives epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes, driving functional differences. Secondly, it
will address how sexually dimorphic responses to vitamin D contribute to monocytic reprogramming. As
epigenetic changes in monocytes is linked with cardiovascular disease (CVD), and given the prevalence of CVD
in both male and female lupus, this proposal will address whether sex-specific changes in metabolic and genetic
reprogramming drive phenotypic differences in lupus monocytes and ask how this relates to prevalence of CMD
and CVD using state of the art cardiac imaging.
Aim 1: Determine whether metabolic pathways differ in monocytes from male and female lupus patients.
We will address how sexual dimorphism in immune responses and immunometabolism in monocytes integrate
to affect outcome between male and female patients using metabolic, proteomic and flow cytometry approaches.
Aim 2: Determine how genetic reprogramming drives sexually dimorphic monocytic function in lupus.
Single cell next generation sequencing will be used to determine chromatin accessibility in monocyte subsets
and ask how this influences gene expression programs and functional differences in male and female lupus.
Aim 3: Assess relative risk of CVD in male lupus using non-invasive cardiac imaging techniques.
Cardiac imaging will determine prevalence of CVD in male and female lupus and correlated with metabolic
changes or gene expression patterns to determine sexually dimorphic responses that determine risk.
Impact: Determining whether metabolic reprograming and epigenetic remodeling are sexually dimorphic in lupus
monocytes will potentially impact treatment approaches as we enter an era where drugs targeting
immunometabolism as being trialed in lupus."
10872225,"Project Summary: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a highly prevalent class of neurodevelopmental
disorders characterized by impairments in social communication and interactions, as well as restricted,
repetitive behaviors. While ASDs are heterogeneous in etiology and severity, the majority of individuals with
ASD exhibit altered sensitivity to light touch. Most ASD research has focused on brain-specific mechanisms
and circuits, with little attention to the contributions of the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord to ASD
phenotypes. We recently found that a range of ASD mouse models (Gabrb3, Mecp2 or Shank3 mutations)
exhibit over-reactivity to light touch, and this hypersensitivity is due to abnormal peripheral somatosensory
neuron function. Somatosensory abnormalities resulting from peripheral sensory neuron dysfunction during
development also lead to disruptions in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) function, as well as social
interaction deficits in adult mice (Orefice et al., Cell, 2016; Orefice et al., Cell, 2019).
 Our findings reveal peripheral somatosensory neurons as a key locus of dysfunction underlying tactile
over-reactivity in ASD, and a role for peripheral sensory neuron dysfunction in abnormal brain development
and aberrant social behaviors in ASD models. Yet, the mechanisms by which peripheral somatosensory
neuron dysfunction alters brain circuit development and results in social impairments remain
unknown. We hypothesize that ASD-related genetic mutations disrupt peripheral sensory neuron function and
tactile processing at the earliest stages of sensory pathways, leading to abnormal brain development, which
results in impaired brain function and disrupted behaviors in ASD. We propose that peripheral sensory neuron
dysfunction leads to elevated sensory inputs to the central nervous system that leads to abnormal S1 function
and altered long-range connectivity between S1 and brain regions that modulate social behaviors, including
prefrontal cortex (PFC), which ultimately impacts social interactions.
 In this proposal, we aim to understand the mechanisms through which peripheral sensory neuron
dysfunction contributes to changes in brain-driven social behaviors. Using mouse genetics, behavioral,
histological, viral, sequencing, optogenetics, and fiber photometry techniques, as well as in vitro and in vivo
electrophysiological approaches, we will: 1) characterize the microcircuit development and long-range
connectivity of trunk primary somatosensory cortex (S1TR); 2) determine whether peripheral sensory neuron
dysfunction in ASD models impacts sensory representation in S1TR; and 3) identify whether peripheral
somatosensory neuron dysfunction impacts the development of S1TR-PFC projections in ASD models.
Because of the accessibility of the peripheral nervous system, insights gleaned from our proposed studies may
lead to opportunities for therapeutic approaches for the treatment of hypersensitivity or aversion to social
touch, as well as the abnormal development of social behaviors and nervous system function in ASD."
10817770,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The C9orf72-mediated ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and FTD (frontotemporal dementia) (C9-
ALS/FTD) are two fatal neurodegenerative diseases with no curative treatment. We aim to address a new
mechanism at the core of C9-ALS/FTD to improve the therapeutic potential. While ALS is an adult-onset disease
with progressive degeneration of motor neurons, and while FTD is characterized with progressive decline of the
frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, the two share a common genetic cause – repeat expansion of the
nucleotide sequence G4C2 in the first intron of the C9orf72 gene. Of the proposed causes of C9-ALS/FTD, the
most significant is the synthesis of dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins from ribosome translation of the expanded
repeats. These DPRs are consistently observed in patient tissues and in various model systems. While the
initiation of DPR synthesis is non-canonical, the elongation of protein synthesis is by the classical ribosome
machinery that translates each codon using a set of tRNA species with the matching anticodon, which is provided
by the cellular tRNA pool. Notably, translation of repeated sequences is highly challenging, requiring repeated
use of the tRNAs for the same codon, where each species must be efficiently charged and post-transcriptionally
modified and matured. This challenge is further intensified in patient cells, where the repeat length can run up to
thousands, raising the question of how the cellular tRNA pool responds to such an unusual demand. This is an
unexplored, but critical, question in C9-ALS/FTD, because the deficiency of quality tRNAs can shift the ribosome
translational reading-frame, leading to frameshifting and synthesis of chimeric DPRs that would alter the disease
pathology. Here we will address this question, based on our extensive expertise in tRNA and in tRNA-associated
ribosome frameshifting. In Aim 1, we will determine changes of the tRNA pool in C9 patient-derived cells relative
to an isogenic control, using our improved tRNA-seq. We will also decipher changes of the ribosome-mediated
global protein synthesis that underlie the disease. We will determine changes both in the iPSC (induced
pluripotent stem cell) state and in the differentiated neuron (iPSN) state, due to their fundamental differences in
regulation of protein synthesis, and due to the potential to produce new insight into the disease during
differentiation. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the course of DPR synthesis can be induced to undergo
a desired frameshifting to produce less toxic proteins that can reduce the disease pathology. We will test how
changes of the abundance and charging levels of the tRNAs required for DPR synthesis can induce the desired
frameshifting. This work will serve as the foundation for understanding the therapeutic implications of tRNA and
ribosome protein synthesis in the development of C9-ALS/FTD, providing a template that is generalizable to
other aging and neurodegenerative diseases associated with nucleotide repeat expansions."
10793590,"Close to 75% of all non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receive radiation therapy at some point in their
treatment regimen whether with curative or palliative intent. Radiation, which is currently given in a highly
localized fashion, causes massive DNA damage leading to DSBs and cancer cell death, yet on its own is not yet
curative. Indeed, while some cancers are intrinsically resistant to IR, others acquire resistance by upregulating
DNA repair pathways. Given modern advances in the targeted administration of radiotherapy, a paradigm shift
leading to curing NSCLC or other tumors could occur if tumor tissue could be globally sensitized to radiation
therapy. The epigenetic susceptibilities we propose to investigate here, may be the key.
The oncogenic JARID/KDM5 histone demethylase subfamily of Jumonji enzymes, which are overexpressed in
multiple malignancies, have recently defined roles in the DNA damage pathway: they mediate DNA repair by
erasing trimethyl marks on active chromatin harboring H3K4me3 marks, thus stopping transcription and
facilitating the recruitment of both homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining repair factors.
The novel concept we propose here is that JARID enzymes must be modified post-translationally upon DNA
damage, likely by radiation-activated ATM or ATR kinases, to enhance their histone demethylating activity on
active chromatin, thus providing a mechanism to stop transcription and recruit repair factors to these sites, for
cancer-cell survival. If true, this novel oncogenic activity of JARID enzymes would have significant
implications for developing new approaches to sensitize lung tumors to ionizing radiation (IR), by selectively
inhibiting the enhanced demethylase activity of JARID enzymes on chromatin. Our specific aims are to:
1.Determine if JARID enzymes are substrates of ATM kinases during the DNA damage response to IR:
 we will determine by mass spectrometry if JARID1B is phosphorylated by ATM/ATR kinases during the DNA
 damage response. We will map the site of phosphorylation and will mutate it to alanine (loss of function) or
 glutamic or aspartic acid (gain of function) to determine the impact on DNA repair dynamics, using isogenic
 cells lines expressing endogenous wt JARID1B (as controls) or null for JARID1B (knock out cells available).
2.Define how oncogenic JARID enzyme activity is modulated by post-translational modifications: we will
 measure the histone demethylase activity of unphosphorylated vs phosphorylated JARID1B enzyme in vitro
 and in cells. We will also determine the genomic sites JARID1B associates with in control vs. in cells
 undergoing DNA damage, and define if JARID1B recruitment to DSBs is dependent on phosphorylation.
Our study will thus have wide impact to lung cancer patients by providing the molecular and mechanistic
foundation for hypersensitizing tumors to radiation by using Jumonji inhibitors to curtail DNA repair through
blocking the histone signals that trigger this repair."
10840898,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is lethal. Our laboratory has identified SLC6A14 to be highly
upregulated in PDAC. SLC6A14 is a broad selective amino acid transporter with the ability to transport both
essential and non-essential amino acids, which includes amino acids for mTORC1 activation, one-carbon
moiety for DNA/histone methylation, and provide precursors for glutathione synthesis to counteract oxidative
stress. We have already published using cell lines and xenograft mouse models that genetic deletion or
pharmacological blockade of SLC6A14 attenuates PDAC growth by causing amino acid starvation and
inhibition of mTORC1 signaling pathway. Using LSL-KrasG12D/+; LSL-p53R172H/+; Pdx-1 Cre (KPC) spontaneous
mouse model of PDAC, we have recently shown that deletion of Slc6a14 improves the overall survival in the
KPC mice. More interestingly, we have found that SLC6A14 inactivation induces autophagy and
macropinocytosis, a nutrient scavenging mechanism that can partly compensate for the amino acid deficit
caused by SLC6A14 loss. In this proposal, our goal is to evaluate SLC6A14 as a potential drug target for
PDAC, characterize autophagy and macropinocytosis induced in response to SLC6A14 loss, and investigate
the efficacy of a combination therapy targeting SLC6A14 and autophagy/macropinocytosis for a better
therapeutic outcome in PDAC as opposed to targeting SLC6A14 alone. To achieve these goals, we propose
three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will demonstrate whether SLC6A14 inactivation attenuates PDAC growth in
KPC mice. For this, we will generate KPC mice in Slc6a14+/+ and Slc6a14-/- background to test whether genetic
deletion of Slc6a14 will delay the development and advancement of PanIN lesions leading to a reduction in the
total neoplastic area in KPC mice. Next, we will treat the KPC mice with and without a-MLT, to test whether
pharmacological blockade of Slc6a14 attenuates PDAC growth in KPC mice. In Aim 2, we will characterize
autophagy and macropinocytosis induced in response to SLC6A14 inactivation, as an alternate mechanism of
amino acid acquisition in PDAC. For this, we will use SLC6A14 inactivated (genetic knockdown and a-MLT
blockade) human PDAC cell lines and pancreatic tissue samples from KPC mice and study the induction of
autophagy and macropinocytosis in these samples. In Aim 3, we will determine whether concurrent inhibition of
SLC6A14 and autophagy/macropinocytosis will lead to a better therapeutic outcome in PDAC. For this, we will
use human PDAC cell line as well as orthotopic implantation mouse models, and test whether a two-drug
combination (a-MLT/HCQ) that simultaneously targets SLC6A14 (𝛼-MLT) and autophagy/macropinocytosis
(HCQ) will have a synergistic/additive effect in growth inhibition PDAC."
10876470,"Abstract
Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major pathogen of severe adult periodontitis, a polymicrobial disease caused by
the coordinated action of a complex microbial community that leads to inflammation of tissues supporting the
teeth. A central hurdle limiting progress in periodontal disease research is the paucity of information detailing
microbial signals that correlate with clinical progression at a site from health to disease. Filling this void, we
recently reported metatranscriptome findings of the microbial community from human clinical samples during
periodontal disease progression and discovered that CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
Palindromic Repeats)-associated proteins in the periodontopathogen P. gingivalis were highly up-regulated only
at those sites that progressed. CRISPRs-Cas systems are used by bacteria to prevent foreign DNA
incorporation, as occurs with a viral attack. The goal of this research program is to understand the role that
CRISPR-Cas systems have on virulence determinants of important periodontopathogens during disease
progression. A comprehensive analysis of the mutants will provide information required to increase our
understanding of not only CRISPR gene function, but also the contribution of these novel genes to virulence. To
this end we propose the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Identify targeted endogenous genes comparing transcriptome profiles of the wild-type and the mutants
growing intracellularly.
Aim 2. Determine the impact of CRISPR-associated genes on the innate immune host responses to P.
gingivalis.
Aim 3. Aim 3. Determine the role of CRISPR-Cas genes in the pathogenicity of P. gingivalis.
 We expect that this knowledge will facilitate the development of targeted approaches to prevent and treat
periodontitis by inhibiting specific Cas proteins essential for virulence. Such results will fundamentally advance our
understanding that such systems have in the metabolism of periodontal pathogens besides their traditional role
assigned as a mechanism of protection against foreign DNA. We believe that the team we have assembled for this
project has all the qualifications to accomplish successfully the goals proposed in the present application."

Title: Mechanistic details of key integral-membrane enzymes for antimicrobial discovery
The increasing number of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria represents a significant threat to human health,
making the development of novel therapeutic strategies critical. The major component of the bacterial cell wall
is the peptidoglycan layer that is a unique meshwork providing essential structural support; therefore,
identifying ways to weaken this layer is an ideal antibiotic strategy. Currently, numerous therapeutics target the
peptidoglycan synthesis pathway and their use has been extremely successful in medicine. The enzymes
involved in the pathway have been extensively characterized except in the case of the membrane components.
Most notable are MraY and MurG, essential proteins that catalyze the membrane steps of peptidoglycan
biosynthesis. There are a few known inhibitors of MraY, such as tunicamycin, demonstrating its potential as an
antibiotic target; however, none of them has found usefulness in the clinic. Our group has developed efficient
total synthesis schemes for two of the most promising natural products, capuramycin and muraymycin, and in
the last funding period we have leveraged this to create novel compounds with improved therapeutic potential.
In this proposal, we describe our plans to use our functional MraY homologs to solve structures in a lipid
environment with various inhibitors and substrate analogs by EM and X-ray crystallography. We have
developed a new assay for MurG that allowed us to identify novel inhibitors. We will further screen additional
compounds and solve their structures with MurG. We will further explore the MurG interaction with the lipid
bilayer and MraY. Our novel inhibitors, APPB and CPPB, have broad efficacy against bacterial pathogens and
show potential as anti-cancer therapeutics. We will leverage the structural work to design the next round of
compound libraries. The breadth of effectiveness leads us to pursue structures of other phosphotransferases,
bacterial WecA and human DPAGT1, in complex with our compounds. This will allow for more targeted small
molecule development. The aims are to 1) perform structural and mechanistic studies of MraY and the
development of inhibitors, 2) carry out mechanistic and structural studies of MurG, and 3) develop novel and
improved phosphotransferase inhibitors. Our combined team of structural biologists and synthetic chemists
provides an innovative approach to achieve these important goals."
10862864,"Project Abstract
Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer death in the United States. Non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), which accounts for the majority (80%) of lung cancer diagnoses, is divided into two major sub-types,
lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). New therapeutic strategies targeting
major oncogenic drivers of LADC have led to improved response rates and patient survival. However, due to a
lack of well-characterized, validated, and therapeutically-actionable oncogenic drivers, similar therapeutic
advances for LUSC have not been forthcoming. Genomic analysis of primary human LUSC reveals that the
most prevalent recurrent genetic alterations in LUSC are concurrent loss of TP53 and copy number gains
(CNGs) at chromosome 3q26 (>85-90%). These genetic alterations are observed in both precancerous lesions
and early-stage LUSC, indicating they are early promotive events in LUSC tumorigenesis. Our previous studies
have demonstrated that the 3q26 genes, PRKCI, SOX2 and ECT2 are coordinately co-amplified and
functionally collaborate to maintain the transformed phenotype of LUSC cells. PKCι, the protein product for
PRKCI, directly phosphorylates and regulates the oncogenic function of SOX2 and ECT2 in LUSC cells.
Furthermore, our preliminary data demonstrate that: 1) overexpression of SOX2, PRKCI and ECT2, in the
context of Trp53 loss, is sufficient to transform mouse lung basal stem cells (LBSCs), a major cell of origin for
LUSC, and drive formation of tumors with malignant LUSC characteristics; 2) PKCι-SOX2 signaling activates a
master transcriptional program specifying lineage-restricted lung squamous transformation; 3) PKCι-ECT2
signaling functions to increase the proliferative potential of LUSC cells through control of MEK-ERK signaling
and enhanced ribosome biogenesis; and 4) both human LUSC cell lines with 3q26 CNGs and SOX2, PRKCI
and ECT2 transformed LBSCs are sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of Auranofin (ANF), a potent
PKCι inhibitor, and to small molecule inhibitors of oncogenic PKCι-SOX2 and PKCι-ECT2 driven effector
pathways including Hedgehog, WNT, NOTCH, MEK-ERK and rRNA synthesis. Based on these data we
hypothesize that: 1) PRKCI, SOX2 and ECT2 represent cooperative multigenic drivers of LUSC
tumorigenesis; and 2) combined treatment with ANF and inhibitors of PKCι-SOX2 and PKCι-ECT2
effector pathways will synergistically inhibit transformed growth of LUSC tumors. These hypotheses will
be tested through completion of two interrelated specific aims designed to: 1) evaluate the efficacy of novel
drug combinations that target oncogenic PKCι effector pathways; and 2) characterize a novel genetically-
tractable mouse model for PRKCI-driven LUSC. Successful completion of these studies will facilitate the
design of novel therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes for patients with LUSC. Furthermore, our novel
clinically-relevant genetically-engineered LUSC mouse model will enhance our understanding of LUSC biology,
characterize LUSC initiation and progression from preneoplastic lesions to malignant LUSC, identify markers
for early LUSC diagnosis and develop and test novel targeted therapies for improved treatment of LUSC."

Candidate: Margaret Greenwood-Ericksen is an early career emergency physician and health services
researcher who seeks to transform Medicaid policy to advance rural mental health (MH) equity. Her long-term
career goal is to develop an independent program of research evaluating the impact of Medicaid policy
interventions on MH outcomes, including co-occurring substance use disorder (SUD), in rural and
underrepresented minority (URM) communities. This K08 award is vital to her ability to achieve this goal
through protected time, training, and mentored research studies. Research Context: There are well-
documented disparities in addressing MH and co-occurring SUD in rural settings, particularly amongst URM
communities. The Emergency Department (ED) is a major access point for rural, Medicaid beneficiaries
seeking MH care, but outcomes after such ED visits are understudied. Medicaid alternative payment models
(APMs) are increasingly deployed to reduce expensive ED-based care, but there is a need to examine the
impact of APMs on MH disparities in rural and URM communities. New Mexico (NM) is ideal for this research
as a largely rural state with one of the nation’s highest Medicaid insurance rates (49%) with a majority-minority
composition including large Native American (12%) and Hispanic (48%) communities. The overall goal of this
K08 is a detailed, state-based study measuring rural MH disparities while testing the effectiveness of NM
Medicaid’s APM as an intervention in rural and URM communities and examining these findings nationally for a
future R01 by the PI studying the impact of different states’ Medicaid policy interventions on rural MH
outcomes. Specific Aims: 1) Measure patient-, health system-, and community-factors associated with
differences in care quality for MH-related ED visits among rural Medicaid beneficiaries, 2) Test how New
Mexico Medicaid MH policy statistically moderates the relationship between rurality and Medicaid quality
measure performance, 3) Identify key policy targets and outcome measures for multistate Medicaid MH policy
evaluation. To accomplish these aims, the PI will learn and apply advanced statistical techniques to NM
Medicaid claims, measuring the intersecting factors on rural MH disparities and testing the effectiveness of NM
Medicaid’s MH APM. The PI will then convene an Expert Panel to examine these findings across Medicaid
programs, identifying measures for a future multistate R01 on Medicaid MH policy. Career Development Plan:
Working closely with mentors, she will 1) Acquire expertise in MH services research and policy, 2) Develop
methodologic expertise in Medicaid claims analysis, multilevel models, and clustered propensity matching, 3)
Learn frameworks for conducting multistate Medicaid policy evaluations and to disseminate research findings.
She has outstanding environmental and mentorship support, including top leadership, a national Advisory
Board, and a CTSC with a strong track record of supporting faculty. Submission responds to AHRQ’s SEN on
Health Equity (NOT-HS-21-014) and Policy on Priority Populations (NOT-HS-21-015)."
10835035,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A gap in knowledge remains regarding how structural organization of synapses, robustly established during
development, is also flexibly modified during learning to sustain behaviors. Knowledge on how the cell biology
of synapses is established and altered in the actuation of memories is of critical importance in our aspiration to
understand how the building blocks of the nervous system come together to produce its functional output,
behaviors. The key scientific premise of my research program is that our understanding of how complex
behaviors emanate from the molecular building blocks of synapses could be meaningfully expanded by
simultaneously interrogating structure-function relationships across scales, bridging knowledge on the molecular
composition of individual synapses within single cells, the organization of single cells within circuits, and the
coordinated activity of circuits within the brain of behaving animals. Achieving this integrated view is a challenge
of critical importance best summarized in the BRAIN Working Group Report to the NIH Director, and requires
new approaches that allow the integration of knowledge across 1) spatial scales, from the subcellular architecture
of the synapse to the cellular architecture of the circuits governing behaviors, and 2) temporal scales, from the
events leading to synaptic assembly during development, to the events leading to synaptic plasticity during
learned behaviors. To address this challenge, my lab established strategic collaborations with network scientists,
microscopists and computational biologists and pioneered integrated approaches that enable unprecedented
access to the cell biology of the synapse in the thermotaxis circuit of C. elegans. Using these approaches we
discovered concepts that reframed how we understand the cell biology of the synapse in vivo, and now position
us to address three fundamental questions in neuroscience: 1) How is synaptic specificity achieved during the
development of the nerve ring neuropil? 2) How are changing metabolic needs met at synapses to sustain
function? 3) How are synapses modified to form memories and underpin behaviors? We propose to answer
these questions for the thermotaxis circuit to define fundamental mechanisms that govern how synapses are
precisely assembled, maintained, and modified to sustain behavior. Importantly, the resulting integrated
understanding across scales will yield new concepts regarding the interplay between the programs that robustly
establish synaptic architecture during development, and the plasticity programs that govern synaptic change to
facilitate behavior. We anticipate, because of the molecular conservation of the examined pathways, that
advancements in our understanding based on these innovations will result in transposable lessons of broad
biological significance."

 Although past studies done primarily on white Americans report that men have a higher risk of mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) and more rapid progression from MCI to AD, we do not know if this is also the case
for African American men. Early characterization of cognitive status and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk in older
African American men is a critical unmet challenge. There have been notably few dementia studies that included
substantial numbers of older African American men. In particular, there is a paucity of neuroimaging data on
older African American men in the years prior to, and during, cognitive decline to AD. We will utilize a cross-
sectional study of older, urban African American men to characterize genetic, social, and environmental
influences on the brain and neural markers indicative of cognitive status and AD risk. My training application will
not only advance our understanding of neural changes and brain activity in older African American men,
especially those exposed to conditions that put them at high risk for AD, but how their brain health relates to
behavioral, genetic, neural, lifestyle, social, and environmental risk factors. Using observational study during the
K99 phase, I will capture brain and neural pathways to cognitive changes/decline in African Americans, while
undergoing extensive training to gain mastery of neuroimaging tools and concepts, proficiency in examining brain
image biomarkers, neuropsychological assessments, and task-based fMRI testing and analyses. In the R00
phase, we will examine the neural pathways through which social and environmental factors impact cognition
and identify individual variability that moderates their impact. Also, we will explore if social and environmental
influences are mediated by their effect on the APOE ε4 and ABCA7-80 genes to impact cognitive status and AD
risk in older African American men. Understanding the mechanisms involved in brain health and AD risk in older
African American men will improve our knowledge of how AD affects men, and which tailored interventions are
most effective for mitigating AD risk and improving cognitive function in African American men. The development
of tailored interventions is increasingly urgent given the increase in the number of African American older adults
experiencing AD and the AD-associated burdens to the individuals, families, and communities. At the end of the
K99, I will have obtained intensive training experience in structural and functional neuroimaging analytic
techniques and increased my knowledge of cognitive and genetic markers of AD. Further, I will have gained
additional expertise in aging-related chronic illness risk reduction in pre-clinical African American men. The
expertise would serve as a basis for my R00 and future independent research, where I would focus on social and
environmental determinants of health to observe and document factors that impact brain health and prevent
Alzheimer’s disease in urban African American men."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is associated with brain and cognition changes as well as well-documented longer-term
micro- and macrovascular complications. The impact of brain changes and cognitive deficits on functional out-
comes, however, is less clear, and most current data relates to T1D youth. Thus, T1D is associated with signif-
icant health and functional morbidity, and in addition to personal costs, community and public health burden is
significant and likely increasing in line with the rising global T1D prevalence. Much current information about
T1D outcomes is derived from cross-sectional or longitudinal studies with short follow-up periods. These have
provided rich data about the short-term T1D impact on individuals, but have an inability to discern causal asso-
ciations and longer-term effects. Longitudinal studies examining within-individual changes in brain and cogni-
tion over time are required to better define specific risk and resilience factors that influence long-term out-
comes. The Royal Children’s Hospital (RCH) diabetes cohort study is the only prospective study of individuals
with T1D from childhood diagnosis through adulthood, with four previous waves of data collection. At baseline,
participants with T1D did not differ from healthy controls on IQ, specific cognitive skills, or emotional well-being.
Subsequent waves of data collection documented structural and functional brain changes, cognitive decre-
ments, and poorer functional outcome in T1D compared to healthy controls into early adulthood. We now pro-
pose a further follow-up of this cohort, the CLARiFY study (The Cognition and Longitudinal Assessments of
Risk Factors over 30 Years (CLARiFY) Diabetes Complications Study), to document brain, cognition, and func-
tional outcomes in mid-adult life ~30 years after T1D onset. We will use longitudinal data from the current study
and from previous waves of data collection to identify which glycemic insults are most detrimental to the
brain/cognition and at which age/stage of neurodevelopment. The following specific hypotheses will be tested:
1) in cross-sectional analyses, T1D subjects will have lower brain volumes, lower cognitive scores, and poorer
functional outcomes at middle adulthood than non-T1D subjects, and in longitudinal analyses, T1D subjects
will exhibit a greater decline in cognitive performance that associates with greater MRI differences at middle
adulthood, and greater change in MRI brain volumes from 12 years to 30 years post-diagnosis; and 2) hyper-
glycemia in childhood (<18 years) will be the strongest dysglycemic determinant of brain health in mid-adult
life. Further, the association between pre-pubertal hyperglycemia and brain outcomes will be most pronounced
in those with (a) T1D onset at <6 years of age; (b) severe hypoglycemia and/or DKA episodes after early expo-
sure to hyperglycemia, and (c) evidence of extra-cerebral microvascular and/or macrovascular disease in mid-
adult life. An empirically based stratification of glycemic neurotoxic ‘risk’ as it varies across the life cycle would
allow clinicians to offer optimal clinical management designed to both achieve good metabolic outcomes while
at the same time protecting the developing brain and preserving cognitive function."
10890685,"The filoviruses Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) are negative-sense RNA viral pathogens that cause periodic outbreaks of severe disease in humans. Despite their importance as emerging pathogens and as public health threats, many aspects of filovirus biology remain understudied. One major knowledge gap concerns the function(s) of the non-protein coding sequences present in filovirus genomes that correspond to 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) in viral mRNAs. These sequences comprise ~22% of the MARV genome and a similar amount of the EBOV genome and yet have been barely studied. Another knowledge gap concerns mechanisms by which viral mRNAs are translated to protein and how this may be sustained when innate immune responses are activated. Beginning to address this, we previously demonstrated a role for an upstream open reading frame (uORF), present in the 5’UTR of the EBOV L open reading frame (ORF), in the regulation of L translation. We further implicated this uORF as providing a means to sustain L expression under conditions innate antiviral defenses are activated. These data support a role for the UTRs as translational regulators which can modulate viral gene expression in the face of innate antiviral defenses. Our recent profiling of MARV 3’UTR function suggests negative-regulatory elements are present in the nucleoprotein (NP) mRNA and that positive regulatory elements are present in the L mRNA. In addition, we previously reported that the MARV genome appears to be edited by adenosine deaminase activity, particularly in sequences corresponding to the nucleoprotein (NP) mRNA 3’UTR. We now show that such mutations substantially increase mRNA translation efficiency, suggesting a means to maintain NP expression when the IFN-induced p150 form of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is upregulated. Interestingly, the regulatory elements within the wildtype NP 3’UTR are also capable of triggering innate immune responses, but this immune stimulating activity is alleviated by the presumptive ADAR1 editing mutations. To follow up on these observations, we propose a combination of transfection- and live virus-based experiments to define the translation regulatory elements in MARV and EBOV 3’ UTRs and to determine how ADAR1 editing impacts viral gene expression and virus replication. We will fully evaluate the capacity of MARV and EBOV 5’ and 3’UTRs to trigger innate antiviral responses, defining the sensors responsible for this induction. Finally, we will create recombinant MARVs with wildtype and mutant 3’UTR sequences. These will be tested in wildtype and ADAR1-deficient cells and mice in order to determine how translational regulatory elements and ADAR1 editing impact viral growth and pathogenesis. Cumulatively, these studies will provide significant new insight into filovirus-host interactions related to translation and innate immune evasion."
10903806,"ABSTRACT
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by a vasculopathy affecting multiple end organs, with complications
including chronic kidney disease (CKD). Albuminuria, an early measure of glomerular injury, is common in
SCD and predicts progressive kidney disease. Kidney function decline is faster in SCD patients than in the
general African American population. The prevalence of rapid decline in SCD is 3-fold higher than in the
general population. Furthermore, high-risk APOL1 variants are associated with an increased risk of
albuminuria and progression of CKD in SCD. Kidney disease, regardless of severity, and rapid eGFR decline
are associated with increased mortality in SCD. As such, early identification of patients at risk for progression
of CKD is important to address potentially modifiable risk factors, slow eGFR decline and reduce mortality.
Despite the high prevalence of CKD and its contribution to increased morbidity and mortality, available
treatments for SCD-related kidney disease remain limited. Although angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
(ACE-I), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and hydroxyurea decrease albuminuria in short-term studies,
their benefits in preventing or slowing progressive loss of kidney function in SCD remain undefined.
We have recently reported that machine learning (ML) models can identify patients at high risk for rapid decline
in kidney function. Further, higher hemoglobin concentration is also an independent predictor of decreased
odds of rapid kidney function decline. With the contribution of intravascular hemolysis to the pathophysiology of
SCD-related glomerulopathy, voxelotor, a small molecule which modifies sickle hemoglobin oxygen affinity and
improves sickle RBC survival, may decrease glomerular injury and slow the progression of CKD in individuals
with SCD.
In this application, we propose the conduct of a prospective, multicenter study to build a ML-based predictive
model for progression of CKD in adults with SCD. Furthermore, in individuals predicted to be at risk for rapid
decline in kidney function, based on the presence of persistent albuminuria (urine ACR ≥ 100 mg/g), we will
evaluate the effect of voxelotor on albuminuria, rapid decline in kidney function and progression of CKD.
With advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of SCD and its complications, combined with an
increasing number of approved drug therapies, early identification of patients at risk for progressive kidney
disease and subsequent increased risk of death is necessary to modify known risk factors, initiate targeted
therapies and possibly increase life expectancy. Further, with the known contribution of hemolytic anemia to
the pathogenesis of SCD-related glomerulopathy and progressive kidney disease, drugs that decrease
hemolysis are likely to be beneficial in preventing and/or slowing the progression of kidney disease in this
patient population."
10918115,"ABSTRACT. Approximately 42% of the U.S. adult population is obese and data suggests that persons with
obesity are at a 30% greater risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, efficacious approaches to
preventing and treating obesity will have significant effects on CRC incidence in the U.S. Although calorie
restriction through lifestyle intervention is the most common approach to treat obesity, clinically meaningful
weight loss is difficult to achieve via this method due to low adherence with calorie monitoring, indicating a need
for innovation. Time-restricted eating, a type of intermittent fasting, has been shown in animals to impart cancer
protective effects including lower body weight, decreased systemic inflammation, and improved glucose
metabolism. Time-restricted eating is where individuals are asked to consume all their food for the day within a
specified time frame, and water fast for the remaining hours of the day. We recently performed two short-term
(≤12-weeks) pilot studies of time-restricted eating to evaluate its safety and preliminary efficacy on body weight
and chronic disease risk markers in adults with obesity. Our results show the intervention is a safe and
acceptable approach to weight loss among obese adults. Moreover, time-restricted eating produced
approximately 3% weight loss from baseline and reductions in systolic blood pressure, oxidative stress and
insulin resistance. Although these pilot findings show promise for time-restricted eating as an effective tool for
CRC risk reduction among obese individuals, these data still require confirmation by a well powered longer-term
clinical trial. The present proposal aims to implement a 12-month (6-month active weight loss phase, 6-month
maintenance phase), controlled, parallel arm trial among 255 obese adults (45-65 years old) who are at elevated
CRC risk. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 groups: 1) Time-restricted eating (weight loss phase: daily ad
libitum food intake from 11am – 7pm), 2) Calorie restriction (weight loss phase: daily 25% calorie restriction), or
3) Control (daily ad libitum food intake, no meal timing restrictions) to compare the effects on: (1) Body weight,
body composition, and intervention adherence; (2) Circulating metabolic, inflammation, and oxidative stress-
related biomarkers; (3) Colonic mucosal gene expression profiles and mucosal inflammation, DNA damage and
cellular growth; and (4) maintenance of benefits on body weight/composition and systemic/mucosal CRC risk
markers. This proposal will be led by a transdisciplinary team with expertise in nutrition science, time-restricted
eating, behavioral science, molecular markers of cancer, gastroenterology, and biostatistics. If the aims of this
proposal are achieved, it will show for the first time that time-restricted eating can be implemented as a novel
alternative to traditional dieting (i.e., daily calorie restriction) for weight control and CRC risk reduction in adults
with obesity. The proposed study will also be the first and most comprehensive examination of molecular
mechanisms that mediate the anticancer effects of time-restricted eating and calorie restriction."
10904863,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of aging-related cognitive decline, affecting more than 5 million Americans over 65 years old, and the number of patients is expected to climb to 13 million as baby boomers age. Our ability to learn and remember declines with age due to progressive changes in synaptic connectivity and function. Synaptic abnormalities also commonly precede neuronal loss during early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. However, we are only beginning to understand the full spectrum of these abnormalities, their contributions to cognitive decline, and the underlying mechanisms. This challenge is largely attributed to the complexity of the brain and etiologies of aging and neurodegeneration. Hallmarks of advanced Alzheimer’s disease (AD) include accumulations of extracellular amyloid peptides and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau protein as well as chronic neuroinflammation. While genes for familial AD have been identified, which shed substantial light on the etiology of the disease, the mechanisms behind sporadic onset AD still remain a mystery. While studies of transcriptional dynamics in the brain have been transformative, transcriptional dynamics do not correlate well with protein dynamics because protein synthesis, turnover and subcellular localization are more tightly regulated spatially and temporally than transcription. Studies have suggested that proteostasis declines with age, impairing cells from managing the inevitable misfolding of proteins. Our team will study protein dynamics in animal models based on bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid (BONCAT) protein labeling. These methods allow us to measure dynamics in protein synthesis and degradation in specific brain cell types relevant to AD. These measurements will provide new information about the disruption of normal cellular processes. The overreaching goal of our collaborative proposal is to bridge critical gaps in knowledge by leveraging the state-of-the-art methods for bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) and quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) to identify brain cell-type contributions to synaptic and neuronal decline associated with AD."
10911927,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Precision medicine in cancer, a disease of the genome, relies on a deep and comprehensive understanding of
the genetic mutations and abnormalities that accumulate in normal cells and drive transformation to cancer. The
Getz and Rheinbay Labs have expertise in the discovery and characterization of point mutations through rigorous
cancer genome analysis. In this proposal, we aim to create a Genome Data Analysis Center (GDAC) focused
on employing our existing tools to robustly and comprehensively characterize point mutations (single-nucleotide
variations and small indels) across the entire cancer genome to address scientific questions related to biological
underpinnings of cancer that arise in each project we are assigned. We also have the flexibility to adapt our tools
as deemed necessary by the unique needs of each project. Specifically, we plan to integrate and characterize
mutations, mutational signatures, and other data types to comprehensively discover cancer drivers in coding and
non-coding regions of the genome, including the often ignored more difficult-to-analyze regions of the genome.
We will do this by incorporating methods to determine DNA methylation signatures as well as by interrogating
the epigenome in both coding and non-coding regions of the genome. We further plan to advance our ability to
determine trajectories of tumor evolution and heterogeneity by adapting our PhylogicNDT suite of tools to
analyze the evolution, subclonal heterogeneity, and timing and order of mutational events from multiple samples
(e.g., samples acquired longitudinally or spatially) from the same patient, or even from cell-free DNA (cfDNA)
from non-invasive blood biopsy. In the interest of advancing the GDC’s goal of improving personalized medicine,
we teamed with expert clinicians and translational scientists, Dr. Keith Flaherty and Dr. Kirsten Kübler, that will
interpret our findings, associate them with clinical data and direct them towards clinical impact. They will also
enhance our tools for identifying the tissue- and cell-of-origin of cancers to not only better understand the
underlying mechanisms of transformation in a particular cancer type or subtype but also provide more effective
therapeutic targets. Moreover, our final Aim is to perform patient-specific analysis to improve and enable
precision medicine, especially in patients whose tumors do not have any identified actionable driver events.
Here, we will employ machine learning techniques to build predictive models of therapeutic vulnerabilities.
Overall, we offer primary competencies in DNA point mutation characterization, analysis of cfDNA, and
determination of mutational signatures to the GDAN. We also bring added value with secondary competencies
in methylation analysis (in the context of mutational signatures), mRNA analysis, single-cell RNA sequencing,
and pathway/integrative data analysis. Bringing our extensive expertise to the various newly assembled Analysis
Working Groups and collaborating with other GDACs within the GDAN can help to answer outstanding questions
in cancer with the ultimate goal of improving diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment for every cancer patient."
10889061,"Summary
Our long-term goal is to understand the precise location and molecular regulation of melanocyte stem cells
(McSCs), with a special emphasis on the role(s) of the Wnt pathway in regulating normal and abnormal McSCs.
Our previous studies reported that McSCs within the hair follicle (HF McSCs) can contribute to hair pigmentation
and possess the potential to produce epidermal melanocytes through activation of Wnt signaling. More recently,
we reported that oncogenic HF McSCs can transform into melanoma and demonstrated that Wnt signaling
crosstalks with mechanisms elicited by oncogenic mutations to drive melanomagenesis. Nonetheless, an
epidermal source of McSCs has been commonly proposed as the most likely contributor to skin MCs, skin
pigmentation and the majority of pigmentation disorders, including vitiligo, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation,
and the deadly skin cancer melanoma, disorders that arise from interfollicular skin epidermis in humans. Thus,
during the last funding period, we asked a fundamental question “do McSCs also exist within the skin
epidermis?” Addressing this requires the examination of epidermal melanocytes for their self-sustainability and
regenerative capacities without contamination of HF McSCs, which possess the potential to give rise to MCs, at
least after skin wounding. The major challenge in the field has been the lack of a melanocyte-specific tool to
distinguish epidermal McSCs (epMcSCs) from HF McSCs in normal skin where numerous hair follicles are
present. Here, we have created a novel mouse model, OCA2-creERT, that solely targets pigmented epidermal
melanocytes without targeting HF McSCs. We have used this novel tool to demonstrate that OCA2+ epidermal
melanocytes are pigmented, yet self-sustaining, and possess the ability to regenerate during homeostasis and
proliferate and differentiate following physiological stimuli like UVB irradiation. These findings have led us to
hypothesize that Oca2+ MCs possess characteristics of stem cell/progenitor cells and perform
regenerative functions in the skin independent of HF McSCs. This new model provides us with the necessary
tools to address, in the next granting period, how Oca2+ MCs possess the lineage capacity to regenerate various
skin melanocytes while retaining a self-renewing capacity long-term (Aim1), how the Wnt signaling pathway
regulates their regenerative behavior in collaboration with other key signaling pathways (Aim2) and whether
OCA2+ epidermal melanocytes can be a cellular source for nevi with a potential for melanoma transformation
under the influence of Wnt signaling (Aim3)."
11171968,"Project Summary: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly
and is driven by multiple genetic and environmental factors that lead to severe loss of central vision. However,
no definitive treatment options are available for the dry form of the disease. Inflammation has been known to
play an important role in maintaining tissue homeostasis. However, a deregulated inflammatory response is
associated with tissue damage and the onset of several aging diseases, including AMD. Even though several
studies have demonstrated the role of inflammation in AMD pathogenesis, the underlying mechanism
controlling the inflammatory cascades, particularly driving the onset of chronic inflammation in AMD, still
remains unknown. We have recently reported the novel finding that in dry AMD patients9,10 and in a mouse
model of dry AMD, there is inflammation induction due to the activation of Akt2 signaling in the retinal pigment
epithelial (RPE) cells-the first cells affected in dry AMD. Importantly, Akt2 inhibition in this mouse model
reduced retinal inflammation and alleviated early RPE changes. Additionally, AMD patients also have
increased Akt2 levels in the macular RPE cells relative to controls. Therefore, to evaluate the role of Akt2
activation in RPE health and in retinal degeneration, we have generated RPE-specific Best1 (Akt2) constitutive
knock-in (KI) mice. These mice show a dry AMD-like phenotype, as evident from basal laminar deposits,
decreased ezrin expression, hyperpigmentation, and morphological alterations in the RPE, as well as
decreased retinal function. We propose to use this mouse model and iPSC-derived RPE from CFH(Y/Y)
[controls] and CFH(H/H) [AMD risk allele containing] donors as novel tools in this study for testing our central
hypothesis that “activation of Akt2 signaling in the RPE triggers mitochondrial/autophagy dysfunction
leading to oxidative stress and inflammation, which are critical factors in early AMD pathogenesis”. To
address this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: Specific Aim 1 (mentored phase): To test our
hypothesis that Akt2 overexpression in the RPE elicits mitochondrial/mitophagy dysfunction thereby inducing
oxidative stress; Specific Aim 2 (mentored phase): To test our hypothesis that activation of Akt2 in the RPE
drives retinal inflammation; Specific Aim 3 (independent phase): To test our hypothesis that the molecular
cascades associated with autophagy-mediated regulation of inflammation are critical in AMD pathogenesis.
The proposed study is significant because we will use a unique, state-of-the-art in vivo animal model and
extend our studies to human iPSC-derived RPE samples to investigate how inflammation contributes to vision
loss in AMD and develop strategies potentially leading to a new treatment modality for early, dry AMD."
10883624,"RESEARCH PROJECT 3: ABSTRACT
Prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among older adults in the US is as high as 56%. Short-term
neurological consequences of OSA include cognitive changes such as poor attention and impaired executive
function, although the mechanisms for these associations are unclear. OSA also increases risk of Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias (ADRD) and mild cognitive impairment, as well as alters ADRD biomarkers.
Positive airway pressure is the gold standard treatment for OSA and improves cognition in clinical trials,
including patients with ADRD. Although American Indians have a high prevalence of obesity, a risk factor for
both OSA and ADRD, no reliable population-based estimates of OSA prevalence exist for AIs. OSA also is
likely underdiagnosed in American Indians, and data strongly suggest a disparity in this modifiable ADRD risk
factor. Accordingly, we will generate population-based estimates of OSA prevalence and its association with
cognitive function, develop a novel intervention, and conduct a randomized pragmatic trial. For the
epidemiology component, we will recruit members of 2 studies affiliated with the Strong Heart Study, the only
population-based study of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in American Indians. We will screen
450 cohort members ages 55+ living on 2 Northern Plains reservations for OSA and measure cognitive
function. Participants with suspected OSA will undergo testing with the WATCHPAT, an FDA-approved sleep
apnea diagnostic device. Participants whose results confirm OSA will be referred for positive airway pressure
therapy and be eligible for the trial. Analyses will leverage previously collected data to identify fixed and time-
varying risk factors for OSA. Next, we will develop the behavioral intervention by using qualitative methods to
revise existing protocols for motivational interviewing and electronic messaging to increase pressure treatment
adherence. For the randomized controlled trial, we will recruit 300 American Indians ages 55+ from the
same Strong Heart Study communities who receive positive airway pressure treatment for OSA. They will be
randomized to receive usual care, or usual care plus the intervention. Data collection at baseline, 3 months
and 12 months will include positive airway pressure adherence, sleep quality, cognitive function, and vascular
risk factors for ADRD. Primary outcomes are positive airway pressure adherence and cognitive function, with
the former evaluated as a mechanistic explanation for change in the latter. Our Specific Aims are to: 1)
Estimate the prevalence of OSA and its association with cognitive function in older American Indians, and
identify OSA risk factors from existing longitudinal data collected by the 2 Strong Heart-Study-affiliated studies;
2) Develop the behavioral intervention and test its effect on positive airway pressure adherence and sleep
quality; and 3) Assess the intervention’s effectiveness on cognitive function and ADRD vascular risk factors.
This unique study explores the relationship between OSA and cognitive function in an understudied, at-risk,
frontier population with limited access to specialized healthcare. It also takes an important step toward
evaluating OSA as a mechanism for the strong association between OSA and ADRD."

We identify critical weaknesses with Classiﬁcation and Regression Trees (CART), a widely used base learner
for machine learning of big omic-data analysis, and propose to replace these with a fundamentally different type
of base learner we call super greedy trees (SGT's). SGT's cut the space in a fundamentally different manner,
resulting in a richer partition structure with provable consistency and superior empirical performance. The project
will develop a uniﬁed SGT framework for big data analysis using machine learning including the treatment of time
varying covariate survival analysis, unsupervised learning, highly imbalanced data and multivariate regression.
The SGT framework will be deployed within scalable and extensible open source software that will allow NIGMS
researchers to deploy them to deal with their challenging big data problems."
10895522,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent advances to characterize cis-regulatory elements (CRE), including massively parallel reporter assays
and CRISPR-based screens of non-coding elements, have transformed our ability to comprehensively
characterize the non-coding genome at scale. Large scale efforts by us and others through the Encyclopedia of
DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium are now underway to apply these methods genome-wide across many
cellular states. The results of these screens will have a transformative impact on our ability to read and write
the regulatory grammar of the cell. One direct application will be in the interpretation of causal alleles for
human disease risk and other phenotypic traits identified through genome-wide association studies. From
these studies we now know the majority of heritability for complex traits resides in non-coding regions of the
genome. Until recently it has been difficult to pinpoint individual causal alleles but progress is now being made
to identify and elucidate their molecular function. Despite our burgeoning success in understanding how a
variant impacts molecular phenotypes (e.g. gene transcription), we lack the ability to systematically evaluate
allele(s) within model organisms to understand their impact on physiological function. This disconnect is
partially due to our inability to identify the homologous non-coding region to target within model organisms. To
aid in modeling human regulatory variation in the mouse, in this project we will develop improved maps of
homologous CREs between human and mouse. Current comparative approaches rely on sequence homology
and correlative measures of gene expression such as regions of DNase hypersensitivity and chromatin
modifications. While these methods have provided valuable insight, they lack direct quantitative measurements
of a CRE's impact on individual genes and the location of the cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) within the CREs
responsible for activity. To overcome these shortcomings, in this study we will develop maps of CRE
conservation based directly on function. To accomplish this, we will differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) from human and mouse to early developmental states as the starting material for screens of CRE
activity. We will use (i) a CRISPR-based screen to endogenously perturb putative CREs important for neuronal
and epithelial function; and (ii) CREs with concordant and discordant activity across the two species will then
undergo saturation mutagenesis using a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA). Results from the MPRA
will identify CRMs (e.g. TF binding motifs) within each CRE driving regulatory activity of the element. We will
use the results from both screens to construct improved maps of CRE conservation that will inform how to copy
the effects of genetic variation residing at these regions across species. Doing so will accelerate our progress
in moving human disease variants into animal models, thereby allowing us to better understand the
pathophysiology of complex diseases in the human population."
10889984,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Stimuli (cues) in the environment associated with reward can motivate normal behavior, bringing one in close
proximity to valuable resources (e.g. food); but they can also gain inordinate control over behavior, as is the
case with addiction. The ability of reward cues to motivate behavior occurs through Pavlovian learning
processes. When a discrete cue is repeatedly paired with presentation of a reward, it can acquire the ability to
act as a predictor, but can also acquire incentive motivational properties. In individuals with addiction, cues that
have been previously associated with the drug-taking experience acquire the ability to maintain drug-seeking
behavior and instigate relapse, even when there is a strong desire to stop use. The neurobiological processes
by which reward cues gain inordinate control over behavior have proven difficult to discern because cues can
simultaneously acquire “predictive” and “incentive” properties, and in most studies these two psychological
processes are confounded. In the proposed studies we will exploit natural variation in cue-reward learning to
identify the neural circuitry specifically responsible for the attribution of incentive motivational value (incentive
salience) to reward cues. When rats are exposed to a Pavlovian conditioned approach paradigm, some,
termed “goal-trackers”, attribute predictive value to a discrete food-associated cue; whereas others, termed
“sign-trackers” attribute incentive salience to the cue. Relative to goal-trackers, sign-trackers are more
susceptible to behavioral control by discrete food- and drug-paired cues and have a greater propensity for cue-
induced reinstatement or relapse. Using this animal model, we have found that the paraventricular nucleus of
the thalamus (PVT) plays a critical role in incentive learning processes and in regulating individual differences
in relapse propensity. The PVT appears to act as a node that integrates “top-down” and “bottom-up” input to
regulate cue-driven behaviors, but the subcortical circuitry subserving incentive salience attribution remains to
be determined. The central hypothesis to be tested here is that both input to and output from the PVT are
necessary and sufficient to promote dopamine-dependent incentive learning. We will use a molecular-genetic
approach with viral vectors to selectively express engineered artificial receptors (e.g. DREADD) to determine
how transiently altering activity of neurons in select PVT circuits affects the propensity to attribute incentive
salience to reward cues. Specifically, we will target inputs to the PVT from the lateral hypothalamus (LH), and
outputs from the PVT to the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh). We will determine whether the PVT-NAcSh
pathway can regulate cue-driven behavior independent of the ventral tegmental area, and how manipulating
these subcortical circuits affects neurochemical activity in the NAcSh. In addition, we will determine if the LH-
PVT and PVT-NAcSh pathways mediate individual differences in the propensity for cue-induced reinstatement
of drug-seeking behavior. This work will identify critical components of the neural circuitry that contribute to
addiction liability."
10669236,"We propose a multi-site, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of the 5-HT2A receptor agonist psilocybin for
smoking cessation. We previously conducted an open-label pilot trial (N = 15) of psilocybin paired with cognitive
behavior therapy (CBT). Data showed a biologically-verified 7-day point-prevalence abstinence rate of 67% at
12 months and 60% at 2.5 years (continuous abstinence rates: 53% and 47%, respectively) (Johnson et al.,
2014; Johnson et al., 2017). We are now conducting an open-label randomized comparative efficacy trial of
psilocybin vs. nicotine patch, both in combination with CBT. Interim results (N = 44; 22 per group) show greater
biologically-verified abstinence rates at 12 months for psilocybin: 7-day point-prevalence: 59% vs. 27%;
continuous abstinence: 36% vs. 9%. Despite these promising findings, we have yet to conduct a double-blind
study of psilocybin for smoking cessation. Furthermore, previous psilocybin study samples have been largely
White with higher socioeconomic status (SES), partly due to lack of participant compensation and modest
funding from non-profit organizations. The current trial will address these issues across three sites with
experience in conducting psilocybin research: Johns Hopkins, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB),
and New York University (NYU). A diverse sample with regard to ethnoracial identity and SES will be recruited
at each site with compensation for study visits. The proposed double-blind study will treat 66 participants (22 at
each site), randomized to receive either: 1) psilocybin; 20 mg/70 in session 1 and 30 mg/70 kg in session 2, with
sessions 1 week apart; or 2) niacin; 250 mg in session 1 and 375 mg in session 2, with sessions 1 week apart.
Niacin was selected because it has been used as an active placebo in two previous randomized therapeutic
trials of psilocybin (Grob et al., 2011; Ross et al., 2016), and the FDA has informed us that niacin is their preferred
active placebo for psilocybin. CBT will be administered to both groups and will allow us to test psilocybin’s
efficacy above and beyond an established treatment approach. Biochemically-confirmed 7-day point-prevalence
abstinence will be assessed throughout for up to 12 months. We hypothesize that psilocybin (compared to niacin)
will cause increased biologically-confirmed 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 12-month follow-up. Based on
pilot data, we will test cognitive/psychological mediators of treatment response. We hypothesize that psilocybin
will be associated with improved cognitive control and decreased anticipation of withdrawal relief (from smoking)
1 day after the target quit date, which will be associated with greater 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 12-
month follow-up. Although psychedelic therapy is a novel approach, the Johns Hopkins site has conducted
psilocybin trials with >700 sessions for >16 years, and has set the standard for the safe conduct of human
psychedelic research with appropriate risk mitigation strategies (Johnson et al., 2008). This trial will provide a
rigorous test of efficacy in a diverse study sample, and test relevant mechanisms, for an innovative smoking
cessation treatment showing potential for substantial efficacy."
10886548,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The mesolimbic dopamine system is at the core of reinforcement learning, and its dysregulation by stimulants
is a major factor in the development of cocaine use disorder (CUD). While dopamine is often linked to valence-
based learning, emerging data - as well as preliminary data in this proposal - has indicated that dopamine
release in the NAc core is evoked by both rewarding and aversive stimuli, thus challenging the idea of bi-
directional valence coding. It is likely that dopamine release in the NAc core signifies how salient – or important
– a stimulus is independ`ent of its positive or negative emotional value (valence). Salience is a key driver of the
speed at which information is learned in an environment; thus, deficits in a system that encodes saliency would
slow many forms of learning - both drug and non-drug associated. If NAc core dopamine signals saliency,
rather than a valence-based signal, aberrations in this system could explain several CUD-associated learning
deficits. For example, deficits in salience attribution would slow learning of new contingencies while leaving
previously learned reward-seeking behaviors, such as drug seeking, intact. Indeed, individuals with CUD
exhibit deficits in fundamental behavioral functions following repeated drug exposure that extend to non-drug
associated stimuli. These deficits in fundamental behavioral functions negatively affect the lives of individuals
suffering from CUD, and the severity of these symptoms is strongly associated with disease progression and
treatment outcomes. Thus, to determine the contribution of NAc core dopamine deficits to CUD symptomology,
it is critical to first understand the role of NAc core dopamine in basic stimulus processing and learning. Next it
will be important to understand how repeated drug exposure dysregulates these basic processes to cause
these deficits. In both rodents and humans, long-term cocaine exposure leads to reduced responsiveness of
NAc dopamine at baseline and to environmental stimuli. Our overarching framework is that cocaine use
increases behavior directed towards drug-associated stimuli, in part, by weakening of the salience of non-drug
associated events. We will combine optical tools for recording and manipulating dopamine release in the NAc
core of mice during behavioral tasks that dissociate valence from behavioral action and saliency to understand
how dopamine drives learning. Next, we will conduct a series of experiments to understand how valence-based
and valence-free learning recruits dopamine release to influence behavior. Finally, we will outline how cocaine
self-administration dysregulates dopamine responses to non-drug stimuli to drive punishment resistance and
deficits in new reward learning. Together these studies will define how cocaine self-administration alters
stimulus processing to drive behaviors characteristic of CUD."
10876327,"Our research program aims to understand how a voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel is made. This is a
complicated multi-step process that requires acquisition of local secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures,
either sequentially or as coupled events. How this happens is, for the most part, unknown. Yet the impact of
these steps is profound, often with pathological consequences. We focus our attention on the human tetrameric
Kv1.3 channel, particularly its early-stage folding, and the determinants that regulate these folding events in
the exit tunnel of the ribosome and the ER membrane. Three Aims comprise this grant proposal. The ability of
a protein to form helices is a fundamental prerequisite for protein folding and function in all proteomes.
However, this process has not been defined in the confined and heterogeneous microenvironment of the
ribosome exit tunnel where a protein is first made. Helicity must occur at the right time and place during
translation. Failure to meet this requirement impairs peptide targeting, chaperone association, efficient bilayer
insertion, and oligomerization. In Aim 1, we specifically ask when, where, how, and why these critical
secondary structures arise in the Kv1.3 nascent peptide. We will determine the molecular mechanisms that
delay or initiate helix formation and identify the underlying peptide-tunnel interactions that are responsible.
To do this, we use biochemical approaches and cryo-EM single particle reconstruction of peptide-ribosome
complexes. In Aim 2, we explore an exciting new field of fundamental importance to how proteins are made,
namely, how a peptide's sequence generates piconewtons of force that fine tune Kv peptide's rate of elongation
and folding efficiency. We use experimental approaches and molecular dynamics simulations to identify the
type of peptide-tunnel interactions giving rise to force, the nature of the force, and its consequences as the
peptide is elongated. Given that human Kv1.3 is expressed in neuronal and immune cells, and impaired
expression produces chronic inflammatory disease and autoimmune disorders, it is compelling to ask whether
human disease-linked variants of the KCNA3, the gene that encodes Kv1.3, introduce
folding/assembly/trafficking defects. In Aim 3, we address this question using the recently developed “genome-
first” approach to determine the clinical consequences of specific KCNA3 rare variants and biophysical
determinations of Kv1.3 folding and function to identify the molecular defects. Our overall vision of Kv folding
includes complex coupled events between intrapeptide segments, the ribosome exit tunnel, and the ER
membrane. We now expand this view by introducing two new concepts for further investigation: 1)
repressor/activator activity acts as a molecular switch to govern the time and tunnel location of Kv helix
initiation, and 2) cotranslational force generation modulates translation rates and folding. Both concepts
represent paradigm shifts that reveal additional levels of regulation for Kv channel folding and may generalize
to the biogenesis of other proteins."
10906258,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health concern that has reached epidemic proportions.
Hypertension is a leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and end-stage kidney
disease, yet 50-70% of adults with CKD fail to achieve blood pressure (BP) control to <130/80 mmHg. A key
process linking high systolic BP (SBP) to CVD is vascular endothelial dysfunction, mediated by excessive
reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced oxidative stress and reductions in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. NO
is also critical in the regulation of renal blood flow (RBF), which is intimately related to BP and vascular
function. Guidelines recommend a stepwise combination of lifestyle modifications and drug therapy to lower
BP, yet adherence to lifestyle modifications such as aerobic exercise is poor in patients with CKD. Drug
regimens often involve multiple medications, as hypertension is challenging to control in CKD. High-resistance
inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST) is a novel lifestyle intervention involving repeated inhalations
against a resistive load using a hand-held device. In a randomized, double-blind, sham controlled, parallel
group design, R21-funded pilot study in 36 midlife/older men and women with baseline SBP ≥120 mmHg, we
showed that IMST (30 breaths [5 minutes]/day at 75% of maximal inspiratory pressure, 6 days [30
minutes]/week for 6 weeks) had excellent adherence (95% of prescribed sessions completed) and lowered
casual (resting) SBP by 9±2 mmHg. IMST improved endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated
dilation, FMDBA) by 40%, linked to increased endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activation and NO
bioavailability, reduced ROS production and oxidative stress, and changes in circulating factors. Importantly,
the effects of IMST on SBP and FMDBA were even greater in individuals with an estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) <75 mL/min/1.73m2. To establish the efficacy of high-resistance IMST in midlife/older adults (≥50
years) with moderate-to-severe CKD (eGFR 20-59 mL/min/1.73m2) and inadequately controlled hypertension
(SBP 130-159 mm Hg), we propose a randomized, parallel group, sham-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial to
evaluate the effects of a clinically relevant treatment duration of IMST (3 months) on SBP, FMDBA, NO
bioavailability, eNOS activation, ROS/oxidative stress, circulating factors, and RBF.
Aim 1: To measure casual SBP (primary outcome) and 24-hour (ambulatory) SBP (secondary outcome)
before (baseline) and after 3 months of IMST or Sham training.
Aim 2: To measure FMDBA (secondary outcome) before and after IMST or Sham training.
Aim 3: To determine: a) endothelial cell culture eNOS, NO and ROS production pre-post IMST or Sham serum
exposure; b) markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant status in biopsied endothelial cells; c) the identity of
the plasma metabolites involved; d) RBF by functional magnetic resonance imaging.
Aim 4: To assess adherence (completed:prescribed sessions), safety, and tolerability of IMST vs. Sham."
10832111,"ABSTRACT
Opioid use is a major source of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and represents an urgent public health
crisis. In recent years, a surge of adults over the age of 50 have developed opioid use disorder (OUD), a
significant and alarming trend that is increasing. Increases in OUD in mid-life and older adults is partially
due to high rates of pain, surgery, and physical ailments in aging populations that necessitate opioid prescription
medications, including oxycodone. Oxycodone (in Percocet™ and Oxycontin™) is consistently among the
medications most widely prescribed for pain, but is also most widely abused and involved in overdose deaths.
Despite its potential for abuse, oxycodone can be highly effective for reducing acute pain. There is an urgent
need for interventions that preserve the analgesic properties of oxycodone while curtailing its abuse potential. A
promising adjunct treatment option for pain management, that could simultaneously reduce the abuse
potential of opioids, is intranasal administration of the neuropeptide oxytocin. Oxytocin has no
recognized addiction potential, and simultaneously has analgesic properties. Preclinical evidence
suggests that oxytocin co-administered with opioids may reduce opioid reinforcing effects. Oxytocin also
decreases experimental pain in human and animal models. Further, evidence in animals and humans support
the shared brain structure and function changes associated with both addiction and chronic pain, which may be
modulated by oxytocin administration. Doses of oxytocin are also well-tolerated by individuals receiving
medications for OUD (e.g., methadone). Based on this evidence, we propose that oxytocin will significantly
reduce abuse liability of opioids and reduce experimental pain. Thirty healthy 55-75 year old volunteers with
some opioid experience will self-administer 48 IUs of intranasal oxytocin (or placebo) shortly after oral oxycodone
(0, 2.5, 5.0 mg) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, within-subjects laboratory study. Subject-
rated abuse liability and cardiovascular and respiratory responses will be assessed before and repeatedly for 5
hours following drug administration. Pain measures will also be collected, including a standardized experimental
pain battery (i.e., quantitative sensory testing with thermal and mechanical testing). This study has tremendous
potential for public health impact in examining intranasal oxytocin as a promising agent for reducing opioid
addictive potential and producing opioid-sparing effects, while effectively reducing pain, which could substantially
advance the field of pharmacotherapy and carve out a novel treatment option, specifically in mid-life and older
adults who may be at higher risk for pain. Results from this project will also advance scientific understanding of
behavioral mechanisms underlying the link between abuse potential and pain. Our multidisciplinary team is
well-suited to address the proposed aims with expertise in (i) intranasal oxytocin administration (ii) human
drug administration and abuse liability testing of drugs of abuse (iii) opioid administration and experimental pain
testing (iv) multi-modal pain assessments and (v) aging."

 Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in the Americas, but has also
globalized due to human migration. Despite being one of the major causes of infection-induced heart disease
worldwide, current therapies for Chagas disease have inconsistent efficacy and frequent side effects. A major
contributor to treatment failure is thought to be the transiently dormant intracellular forms of T. cruzi that are resistant
to otherwise highly effective trypanocidal compounds. The newly discovered benzoxaborole AN15368 represents the
first extensively validated and safe clinical candidate for the treatment of Chagas disease. With the mRNA processing
pathway as the apparent target, AN15368 acts as a prodrug that requires cleavage by parasite serine carboxypeptidases
(TcCBPs) to yield the active metabolite. This proposal aims to gain additional understanding of this processing step for
AN15368 as a prodrug, as well as to assess the potential for acquired resistance as this compound proceeds toward
human clinical trials.
 Aim 1 will take advantage of our well-established quantitative mass spectrometry platform to extensively study
the kinetics of AN15368 metabolism in amastigotes and epimastigotes, the two proliferative life stages of T. cruzi. A
concentration-gradient model will be constructed based on this study to test the hypothesis that only the prodrug, but
not the processed form, can enter T. cruzi efficiently and once processed, accumulates therein. Furthermore, these
kinetic studies will address the differential susceptibility of epimastigotes and amastigotes to AN15368 to further
understand the process of prodrug metabolism. Aim 2 will focus on the breadth of susceptibility to the prodrug in the
amastigote populations. A fluorogenic substrate will be developed to allow for the quantitation of prodrug activation in
individual amastigotes, including the transient dormant ones. We will test the hypothesis that the susceptibility to this
prodrug is broad in amastigotes, including those in dormancy. Lastly, since the prodrug feature brings AN15368 the
liability of acquiring selected resistance via loss of the processing pathway, we propose to carry out Aim 3 to
comprehensively monitor the outcome of infection when TcCBPs are disrupted, with and without AN15368 treatment.
This will provide an assessment for the risk of this resistance if developed.
 The proposed work will enhance our understanding of how prodrug AN15368 achieves sterile cure of T. cruzi
infection, and will be the first study attempting to quantify a metabolic process in dormant parasites to address drug-
mediated cure. The results of these studies are expected to provide insights into the high therapeutic potential of
benzoxaboroles in this and other parasitic infection, as well as one of the risks for induction of drug resistance to this
class of compounds and thus inform on the safety and efficacy of this clinical candidate."

HER2-targeted therapies are promising treatment options for metastatic breast cancer and have improved the
median overall survival. However, breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM), which is observed in up to 50% of
HER2-positive breast cancer patients, continues to be a clinical challenge with most patients surviving less than
2 years following CNS involvement. These dismal outcomes underscore the need for new and more effective
treatments for BCBM. Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has led to durable responses in patients
with certain types of blood cancers. However, the treatment of brain tumors, such as BCBM, involves a unique
set of challenges, including limited infiltration of CAR T cells, heterogenous expression of target CAR antigens,
and high systemic toxicity. Although direct intracranial administration of CAR T cells has resulted in anti-tumor
responses in a few patients with relatively low systemic toxicity, BCBM is multifocal and requires repeat
treatments, which pose significant challenges to effective delivery. Moreover, in recent clinical trials,
heterogeneous antigen expression led to relapse from the outgrowth of antigen-negative tumor cells. Therefore,
new strategies that can concurrently increase CAR T cell infiltration, combat tumor heterogeneity, and limit off
target toxicity are necessary to address the critical and unmet need to treat BCBM. Recently advances in
Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) technology and CAR T cell engineering are
uniquely suited to advance CAR T cell therapy for difficult-to-treat BCBM. Closed-loop control of MRgFUS
enables spatially localized and noninvasive application of mild hyperthermia (41.5 ± 0.5 oC) in the brain across
an intact skull that can transiently increase perfusion and vessel permeability in brain tumors. Preliminary studies
indicate that FUS-induced hyperthermia also increases trafficking of CAR T cells to brain tumors. In
complementary studies, engineered CAR T cells that respond to mild hyperthermia (40–42 oC) by producing a
bi-specific T cell engager (BiTE) that targets CD3 and natural killer group 2 member D ligands (NKG2DL) has
been shown to potentiate anti-tumor activity and mitigate antigen escape. By merging these synergistic advances
in image-guided therapy and CAR T cell engineering, the proposal objective seeks to apply thermal targeting of
brain tumors by MRgFUS to enhance therapeutic trafficking of CAR T cells and spatially control the intratumoral
production of BiTEs to potentiate anti-tumor responses against BCBM. Preclinical studies will focus on HER2+
BCBM using both syngeneic and human HER2 (hHER2) transgenic mouse models. The proposed grant will
refine, integrate, and test using clinically relevant models two exciting technologies that, if successful, can offer
desperately needed new treatment strategies to patients with BCBM."

Arsenic contamination of food and drinking water is a serious global health issue in the U.S. and worldwide.
Arsenical skin lesions are a common and early sign of arsenic toxicity, but exposure to arsenic is also
associated with risk for various types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, non-malignant respiratory disease,
and shortened life span. A major focus of epidemiological research on arsenic exposure has been
understanding genetic susceptibility to arsenic toxicity. Genetic studies have discovered roles for both
inherited variation (e.g., AS3MT variants) as well as dynamic features of the genome (i.e., telomere length) in
susceptibility to arsenic toxicity and response to exposure. Additional research is needed to fully understand
these gene-environment relationships. The last decade of research on genetic susceptibility to disease in
humans has clearly demonstrated that large studies with genome-wide measurement are highly likely to deliver
discoveries that are re-producible. Thus, we propose creating a large genomic data resource in the context of
an epidemiological study of arsenic exposure in rural Bangladesh. We will use this resource to identify the
features of the human genome that reflect susceptibility or response to arsenic exposure. Our first goal is to
extend our ongoing work on the genetics of arsenic metabolism efficiency (AME) and GxE (gene-by-
environment interaction) to identify inherited variants that influence arsenic metabolism or arsenic toxicity.
Under this goal, we will investigate the biological mechanisms of arsenic-related variants and evaluate the
utility genetic information for exposure reduction. Achieving this goal will entail activities such as genome-wide
association and heritability studies of AME and arsenical skin lesion risk, genome-wide searches for GxE,
estimating the effects of SNPs on arsenic-related health outcomes, and evaluating the impact of returning
genetic results to participants on exposure-related behaviors. Our second goal is to extend or our work on
arsenic and telomere length to identify additional dynamic features of the genome that reflect biological
response to arsenic or susceptibility to arsenic toxicity. Achieving this goal will entail testing numerous
genomic features for association with arsenic exposure and arsenical skin lesion status, including somatic
chromosomal losses and point mutations, DNA methylation, epigenetic aging, and mitochondrial DNA mutation
and copy number. If successful, this project will provide novel biomarkers of susceptibility and toxicity as well
as biomarkers of the biological effects of arsenic exposure. The biomarkers identified will provide information
useful for (1) identifying subgroups of highly susceptible individuals, (2) understanding biological mechanisms
underlying susceptibility and toxicity, and (3) motivating susceptible individuals to reduce their exposure.
Furthermore, we will continue developing technologies for targeted measurement of copy number variable
regions for large scale epidemiological and environmental health research. This work has the potential to have
transformative impact not only on knowledge, but also on both global and local environmental health."

Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are “interconnected” syndromes in
which each influences the other. CKD is a risk factor for AKI and AKI contributes to the
development or progression of CKD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular symptoms,
and death, not to mention recurrent AKI episodes and impaired health-related quality of life
(HRQoL). Processes of care after AKI hospitalization have been found to be suboptimal, with
lack of continuity of care, delayed follow-up and suboptimal medication management
exacerbating the risks of adverse outcomes. In addition, optimal pharmacologic therapy, such as
blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) or sodium-glucose cotransporter
type 2 (SGLT2), has not been defined. The Caring for OutPatiEnts after Acute Kidney Injury
(COPE-AKI) Consortium will address these important gaps in knowledge of optimal
management of patients surviving an episode of moderate (stage 2) or severe (stage 3) AKI. The
goal of the COPE-AKI Consortium will be to develop and test interventions to optimize
processes of care and identify key pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions to
reduce morbidity among these high-risk patients. The Center for Clinical Trials & Data
Coordination (CCDC) at the University of Pittsburgh is well poised to serve as the Scientific and
Data Research Center (SDRC) for the COPE-AKI Consortium. Our multidisciplinary
investigative team has a history of collaboration, wealth of experience and expertise, including
expertise in acute and chronic kidney disease, critical and translational care, medication
management, design of clinical trials, telehealth, clinical and data coordination, project
administration support, biostatistics, measurement of patient-reported outcomes, health
services research and patient engagement. Our goal is to serve as the Scientific and Data
Research Center for the COPE-AKI Consortium. Specifically, we will 1) establish an efficient and
rigorous process for designing the Consortium study, including protocol development and
adaptation of an existing web-based data collection system; 2) provide comprehensive expertise
for data management and analysis within the Consortium; and 3) provide program coordination
and administrative support throughout all phases of the study."
10851922,"Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has profoundly impacted diagnostic imaging of the human
retina, enabling accurate and early diagnosis of retinal disease. The relatively high cost of current
clinical instruments limits its use in cost sensitive environments, e.g. screening in the
optometrist's or general practitioner's office, underserved or rural US populations and developing
countries. Motion of the patient and/or interferometer strongly effects phase stability and image
quality, impacting the common approaches which scan a focused beam across the retinal surface.
Collecting the entire field at once via an approach such as Full-Field Optical Coherence
Tomography (FF-OCT), would obviate this issue and provide high spatial phase stability. Here we
propose a novel solution that not only overcomes these issues (poor phase stability and coherent
artifact) but promises to do so while reducing costs and increasing imaging speed. We will take
advantage of rapid development in two key technologies, additive manufacturing for optical
components and extremely high megapixel CMOS arrays. Building on concepts from our prior
work, we will develop an FF- OCT system by mapping the 3-dimensions (x,y, and k) onto a 2-D
CMOS array within an imaging spectrometer. This will in turn allow us to utilize inexpensive
spatially incoherent light sources which do not produce coherence artifacts, but heretofore were
limited to use with time-domain FF-OCT systems. This will be accomplished via 3 Specific Aims.
Aim 1, Develop a 3-D printed structure for image remapping in FF-OCT: We will deploy a micro-
optical design consisting of arrays of 3-D printed single mode fibers that map x,y in the image
plane, to spaced columns. The space between the columns will enable dispersion in k within the
2-D spectrometer developed in Aim 2. This structure will enable volumetric OCT imaging with a
single camera exposure by mapping x, y, and k onto a 2-D array.
Aim 2, Develop an imaging spectrometer and spectral domain FF-OCT system around a high
megapixel (Mp) CMOS sensor: We will design and develop an imaging spectrometer that will be
compatible with the structure(s) from aim 1, integrating the structures as they become available.
Aim 3, System validation and human retinal imaging: After validation on tissue phantoms,
pilot human data from a spectrum of retinal diseases will be acquired and compared with
standard-of-care clinical imaging systems. We expect the completed system to have an FOV of 5
mm diameter, 15.5 µm lateral sampling, 7.5 µm axial resolution and be able to collect a volume
image in as little as 200 µs at 48 volumes per second."
10909205,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States and physical activity is a potent
way to decrease this risk. Serious gaps remain in our understanding of the optimal duration of physical activity
and sedentary behavior during adolescence and young adulthood if risk for concurrent and future CVD is to be
averted, and were specifically identified as priority research areas in the 2018 Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. Adolescence and young adulthood are critical
transition periods that set physical activity patterns for the rest of adulthood and may represent a critical window
for early intervention. The overall objective of this K08 is to develop evidence to bridge the HHS-articulated gaps
by describing independent effects of sedentary behavior in adolescence and thresholds of physical activity in
young adulthood on the prevention of later-life CVD to inform future HHS guidelines. The central hypothesis is
that highly sedentary adolescents and young adults will require higher physical activity levels to reduce CVD risk
in later adulthood. This project will analyze longitudinal cohort data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive
Development (ABCD) Study, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), and
the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study. The Specific Aims will: (1) determine
independent associations of contemporary forms of sedentary behavior (screen time) in adolescents with CVD
risk factor incidence; (2) evaluate associations of attaining HHS-recommended adolescent (60 mins/day, 7
days/week) versus adult (30 mins/day, 5 days/week) physical activity levels during specific age ranges in young
adulthood with incidence of CVD risk factors; and (3) estimate population-level lifetime effects of adolescent and
young adult sedentary behaviors, physical activity dose, and their interactions on later-life CVD mortality. The
candidate’s long-term career objective is to become an independent physician-epidemiologist generating
actionable evidence to optimize adolescent and young adult behaviors to prevent CVD later in life. The proposed
career development plan will provide training and mentorship in: (1) physical activity, sedentary behavior, and
CVD epidemiology and measurement; (2) longitudinal analyses and modeling methods; (3) guideline
development and implementation; and (4) career development and plan for independence. Training will be

10916192,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We propose to develop and refine neural networks gene expression to understand gene
regulation in diseases. We will design deep learning frameworks to integrate various datasets
(histone modifications, 3D conformation, sequences, and SNPs) and model their relationship
with the gene expression. Our proposed models will explicitly capture the underlying structure
and complexity of the biological data to learn meaningful connections. For example, we will use
a graph-based neural network to model the 3D conformation of the DNA as a graph and learn
from the connections between different genomic regions to predict gene expression. One of our
critical goals for using these methods is to extract relevant signals that could be contributing to
the up- and down-regulation of genes. We will accomplish this goal by applying interpretation
methods for neural networks. These methods will allow us to assign importance scores to the
input features that contribute the most towards a particular prediction of interest. Comparing
these scores for genes across healthy and disease cell lines will provide insights into gene
misregulation and serve as a hypothesis driving tool for biological experiments. We also
propose a novel Bayesian inference-based interpretation method to improve explanations of
graph-based neural networks that could be applied to various tasks. Finally, given the
improvement of single-cell technologies and imputation methods, we will extend our deep
learning frameworks to model relationships between signals like chromatin accessibility and
DNA methylation with gene expression. This direction will allow us to explore the effectiveness
of the imputation methods in removing noise and generating high-quality single-cell samples for
usage in deep learning modeling of gene regulation. Looking at the modeled relationships
across the cell's developmental stages could pinpoint timepoints for potential misregulation in
diseases. Therefore, this proposal aims to develop unified approaches that utilize datasets
spanning multiple repositories to leverage their collective knowledge and improve our
understanding of diseases in a data-driven manner."
10863865,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are profoundly debilitating and fatal
neurodegenerative diseases with overlapping clinical, pathologic and genetic features. Despite advances in our
understanding of the pathology and genetic basis of ALS/FTD, the cellular mechanisms underlying
neurodegeneration remain poorly understood, and current treatments extend life for only a few months. Almost
all ALS patients and nearly half of FTD patients have pathologic aggregates composed of transactive response
DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), a DNA and RNA-binding protein with multiple roles in RNA stability,
splicing and post-transcriptional RNA processing. Moreover, mutations in TDP-43 and other RNA-binding
proteins cause familial and sporadic ALS/FTD, highlighting altered RNA metabolism as a common pathogenic
mechanism of neurodegeneration. Recent studies have identified genetic interactions between TDP-43 and
Ataxin-2, an RNA-binding protein that contains a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract normally 22-23 glutamines in
length. Expansions of the Ataxin-2 polyQ tract (27-33 glutamines) increase risk for ALS and ALS-FTD overlap
disease. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which Ataxin-2 / TDP-43 interactions increase
disease risk are unknown. The objective of this proposal is to determine the molecular basis of Ataxin-2 / TDP-
43 interactions and their impact on TDP-43 dependent RNA regulation, including RNA splicing and stability as
well as spatiotemporal localization and translation of mRNA. In preliminary and published work, we and others
find that TDP-43 and Ataxin-2 are components of neuronal ribonucleoprotein granules, RNA/protein-rich
compartments that regulate mRNA stability, transport and translation. Our preliminary data show that Ataxin-2
polyQ expansions disrupt anterograde transport and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of TDP-43
RNA granules that contain mutant Ataxin-2. Collectively, these data support our central hypothesis: Ataxin-2
polyQ expansions aberrantly scaffold TDP-43 / Ataxin-2 interactions and sequester TDP-43, disrupting nuclear
and cytoplasmic functions of TDP-43. We will test this central hypothesis using complementary live-cell
imaging and single-molecule imaging approaches, single-molecule FRET, translation assays, and RNA-
sequencing/transcriptomics (i) to study the effect of Ataxin-2 polyQ expansions on TDP-43 transport and post-
transcriptional regulation of TDP-43 target mRNAs in wild-type or Ataxin-2 mutant neurons; and (ii) to identify
Ataxin-2 and TDP-43 domains required for aberrant interaction and to design small molecule inhibitors of TDP-
43 / Ataxin-2 polyQ interactions. The proposed research will provide new insights into (1) the molecular basis
of Ataxin-2/TDP-43 interactions that confer increased ALS and ALS-FTD risk, (2) how Ataxin-2 polyQ
expansions interact with TDP-43 to impact the transcriptome and spatiotemporal localization of mRNA in
neurons, and (3) potential molecular targets for mechanism-based therapies."
10873273,"Novel DNA damage response therapeutics targeting replication protein A
Abstract
The DNA damage response (DDR) is now considered a tractable pathway to target for cancer therapy. The
DDR and DNA repair pathways are also amenable to personalized therapies by exploiting synthetic lethal
interactions as evidenced by the clinical success of PARP inhibitors in homologous recombination (HR)
deficient cancers. The DDR is initiated by engagement of the PI3 kinase-related kinases ATM, ATR, and DNA-
PK. These kinases and the downstream checkpoint kinases CHK1 and CHK2, are clinically validated targets
being actively investigated in multiple clinical trials. A novel target in the DDR pathway is the human single
stranded DNA binding protein, replication protein A (RPA) which plays a critical role in the DDR to detect
replication stress (RS) and signal to the ATR kinase. RS is a common feature in cancer cells and provides the
therapeutic window for the anticancer activity of DDR targeted drugs. RS coupled with a DDR blockade results
in replication catastrophe (RC) and eventually cell death. RPA is a critical protector from RC and depletion of
RPA or “RPA exhaustion” can elicit RC and cell death when there is insufficient single-strand DNA binding
capacity to protect the genomic DNA. We have identified a potent and selective small molecule RPA inhibitor
(RPAi), NERx 329, which possesses biochemical RPA inhibition and cellular engagement of RPA. NERx 329
also displays no overt toxicity in vivo and possesses anticancer activity alone and in combination with DNA
damaging chemotherapeutics and certain DDR targeted agents. While the anticancer activity could be the
result of inhibiting RPA’s role in individual repair or replication pathways, our published and preliminary data
point to a more global mechanism of action. Our overarching hypothesis is that chemical inhibition of
RPA can mimic RPA exhaustion to inhibit the DDR and provide selective anticancer activity via novel
genetic interactions common in lung and ovarian cancer. To address this hypothesis, we will elucidate the
mechanisms and determinants of the cellular anticancer activity of our novel RPAi. We will focus on two
cancers types, high grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as
our analysis of clinical survival data reveals an important role for RPA in these cancers. In Aim 1 we will
interrogate how chemical exhaustion of RPA impacts RS and the DDR in lung and ovarian cancer. Aim 2 will
focus on elucidating the genetic determinants of sensitivity to RPAi’s. We will identify novel chemical-genetic
interactions in a DDR focused CRISPR screen assessing RPAi activity. Clinically relevant genetic interactions
will be identified in a unique series of PD-EOC spheroid lines we have developed. Whole genome sequencing
will identify genetic alterations and chromosomal rearrangements which may correlate with response to RPAi
therapy. From these studies, specific genetic alterations that impact RPAi sensitivity will be validated with in
vivo PDX models of lung and ovarian cancer and DDR targeted developmental therapeutic agents. Completion
of these aims will define RPAi mechanism of action and the genetic interactions that dictate RPAi sensitivity.
These data are crucial towards developing novel DDR targeted cancer therapeutics and identifying the relevant
genetics characteristics to maximize patient response and efficacy."
10890623,"Project Summary
Perhaps the defining feature of the eukaryotic cell is its organization into biochemically distinct compartments
known as organelles. While the biochemical functions of individual organelles are often well known,
how cells regulate the copy numbers, sizes, and subcellular positions of its diverse organelles in a coordinated
fashion and how organelles interact to produce integrated physiological outputs remain one of the grand
challenges in cell biology. The goal of my research program is to discover the quantitative principles
governing how cells regulate systems-level organelle dynamics to coordinate metabolism, growth, and
proliferation. To achieve this goal, my research strategy will proceed along two directions. In the first
direction, I will quantitatively determine how cells coordinate systems-level organelle dynamics with cellular
growth demands. Specifically, I will quantify and build a mathematical model of the relationship between
cellular organelle composition and cell growth. The model will be calibrated from data obtained by
simultaneously visualizing all major metabolic organelles using our machine learning-based hyperspectral
imaging platform, exerting chemical biological control over cell growth and proliferation rates, and genetically
perturbing key organelle biogenesis, organization, and interaction factors. In the second direction, I will
determine how cells coordinate systems-level organelle dynamics and gene expression to control metabolism
during growth and proliferation. I will categorize single cells according to their organelle content and
systematically measure the temporal correlations in their expression of genes whose products execute
organelle-specific functions. I will concomitantly measure the metabolomic profile of these cells sorted by
organelle content. I will then combine these measurements to develop a mathematical model that quantitatively
captures the connection between gene expression and metabolism as mediated by the cell's organelle
makeup. I will subsequently test predictions of this model by systematically tuning organelle interaction
strengths by modulating the expression of organelle biogenesis factors and organelle contact sites. Successful
investigations along these two directions will yield mechanistic insight into how to untangle the complex
interdependencies between organelle dynamics, metabolism, and cell growth and proliferation. A systems-
level understanding of how organelle composition and interactions coordinate metabolism to control cellular
growth and development will lay a rigorous foundation into future investigations into how the cell actively
shapes its organelle composition to match biochemical supply with physiological demand through, how this
plasticity is leveraged in health by multicellular organisms to provide the metabolic flexibility needed to develop
its myriad cell types, but also in disease by allowing for multiple routes to metabolic pathologies in cancer,
diabetes, and aging."
10886529,"Mechanisms and Consequences of Apoptosis and Apoptosis-induced
Proliferation in Drosophila
Principal Investigator: Andreas Bergmann, Ph.D.
University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA
 Apoptosis is the major form of cell death that is critical for normal development and tissue
homeostasis of multi-cellular organisms. Defects in the regulation of apoptosis contribute to the
pathogenesis of multiple diseases including those associated with reduced rates of cell death
(cancer, autoimmunity) or with excessive cell death (neurodegeneration, stroke, myocardial
infarction). Apoptotic cells interact with and influence the behavior of their cellular environment
by releasing anti-inflammatory, pro- and anti-apoptotic as well as mitogenic signals. The release
of the latter triggers Apoptosis-induced Proliferation (AiP) which describes the ability of
apoptotic cells to induce regenerative proliferation of neighboring surviving cells, thus
compensating for their loss. Unexpectedly, evidence obtained in several organisms including
Drosophila, Xenopus, Hydra, Mouse and human cancer suggests that regenerative AiP of
amputated or otherwise damaged tissues including tumors depends on apoptotic caspases
(highly specific cell death proteases) in addition to, but independently of, their apoptotic function.
 The overall objective of this scientific program is to gain a comprehensive
understanding of the biological principles that underlie the regulation of apoptosis and AiP in a
multi-cellular organism, to identify and characterize the genes involved in these processes, and
to develop methods to manipulate them. We are using the powerful genetic model organism
Drosophila melanogaster for these studies. We have developed genetic models of apoptosis
and AiP, and initiated forward genetic screens that directly assessed the genetic basis of these
fundamental processes. This application focuses on four key questions. 1. How is the fine-tuning
of caspase activity achieved? 2. What are the proteolytic targets of caspases for non-apoptotic
functions? 3. How do caspases control the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for AiP?
4. How do macrophages (hemocytes) adopt an activated phenotype for growth control?
 This program is very relevant for understanding of human cancer. Our studies elucidate
mechanisms by which potential tumor cells increase their resistance to apoptosis, a hallmark of
cancer, which may generate immortalized (undead) cells. Moreover, apoptotic tumor cells
promote caspase-dependent AiP. For example, although radio- and chemotherapy attempt to
cure cancer by killing tumor cells, relapse of treated tumors is frequently observed which may
be due to an AiP-promoting activity of dying tumor cells. Therefore, the results of this research
program will significantly improve our understanding of apoptosis and regenerative
proliferation under normal conditions, and tumor phenotypes under pathological conditions."
10836474,"Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section
Many intracellular targets involve intracellular protein-protein interactions that are “undruggable” because the binding surfaces are too large and featureless to be blocked by a standard rule-of-5 compliant small molecule. Recently, there have been attempts to catalog molecules that are orally bioavailable but lie beyond the rule of five (bRo5) to access these targets.  Macrocyclic peptides can inhabit this bRo5 space, and a key advantage to using peptides as bRo5 molecules is that there are many mature techniques for finding peptide binders from vast libraries.  Arguably, the most powerful of these techniques is mRNA display, which allows creation of peptide libraries containing over 10 trillion variants, 6-7 orders of magnitude larger than a standard peptide library prepared on beads. The extreme diversity of these libraries has enabled many successes in inhibitor development.  Yet these successes are disconnected from real drug discovery, because the peptides uncovered are much too large to be bRo5 compliant.  Libraries that are short in sequence and bRo5 compliant can be created by mRNA display, but these libraries lack the diversity needed to uncover potent inhibitors because standard mRNA display is limited by the genetic code to ~20 variants at each position.  In this proposal, strategies to enhance this positional diversity will be pursued.  This will first involve breaking the degeneracy of the standard genetic code through isolation of fully modified tRNA isoacceptors.  Based on codon reading rules it is predicted that this will allow the addition of 10 non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) to the code. The second aim focuses on combining these newly defined codon reading rules and previously described tRNAs with unnatural base pairs to allow expansion of the genetic code to the use of 40 monomers at each position.  This aim will also focus on developing and testing a curated group of aminoacyl-tRNAs for the future creation of bRo5 compliant libraries containing billions of variants for use in drug discovery."
10890011,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
In addition to their debilitating impact on health and well-being, multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) account for
90% of Medicare spending. Among beneficiaries, 65% have 3 or more conditions such as diabetes and
hypertension, and 23% have 5 or more. MCCs are often addressed in primary care, where time pressures
prevent focusing on self-management—although such skills are crucial for living successfully with MCCs. Our
long-term goal is to improve health and self-management for these patients, while reducing healthcare costs.
An AHRQ-funded P50 supported our development of Elder Tree (ET). That eHealth system was shown in a
randomized trial to improve quality of life and health factors among older adults with MCCs who were high
users of primary care. ET provides tools, motivation, and support to help patients manage their health. Despite
positive results, many did not use ET extensively, a very common problem with health apps. Our central
question is whether adapting and delivering ET with voice-controlled technology can increase ET use, thereby
improving quality of life and health outcomes even more than ET on a laptop. Smart speakers, used by talking
and listening rather than typing and reading, offer the tantalizing but unproven promise of being easy to use,
which may in part explain why the technology is being adopted faster than the internet or TV. Smart displays
raise expectations even higher by adding a visual element that enables the system to ""show"" as well as ""tell.""
We propose an R61/R33 project including a randomized clinical trial involving 282 (after attrition) patients age
65+ with 5 or more chronic conditions, 3 of which must be hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes, or
pre-diabetes. In the proposed 12-month trial plus 6-month follow-up, patients will be randomly assigned to
receive ET via a laptop (ET-Text) or a smart display (ET-Voice). The project has the following specific aims:
Aim 1: During the R61 phase, continue and complete development of the platform and operational procedures
for delivering ET to the smart display group. Aim 2: During the R33 phase, conduct a balanced randomized
clinical trial to test these hypotheses: Primary outcome: ET-Voice (vs. ET-Text) patients will have better
functional health (a measure including physical function, pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and
depression) over time. Secondary outcomes: ET-Voice (vs. ET-Text) patients will have better outcomes for
loneliness, number of symptoms, and healthcare use over time. In addition, amount of ET use, ease of use,
and usefulness will be higher for the ET-Voice (vs. ET-Text) group. Mediators: Effects of study arm on
outcomes will be mediated by ET use at 6 months and by Self-Determination Theory constructs of
competence, social relatedness, and intrinsic motivation. Moderators: ET-Voice (vs. ET-Text) will show greater
improvements in the primary outcome for: those age 65-74 vs. 75+ years old, women vs. men, those with 8+
vs. 5-7 chronic conditions, and those with more physical barriers to technology use (e.g. tremors). We will
explore whether these moderation effects are also observed for the secondary outcomes."

Scientific Approach: Patients with severe dentofacial disharmonies (DFD; jaw disharmonies) seek orthognathic
surgery and orthodontic care to address issues with mastication, esthetics and speech. Preliminary data from
thousands of DFD patients generated by our colleagues at UNC-CH indicate speech concerns surpass impaired
chewing function as a motivator for surgery. Due to limited studies, we, as providers, are unable to give evidence-
based recommendations as to whether our orthodontic and surgical interventions will address speech disorders
associated with DFD. Despite limited data, patients undergo invasive jaw surgery in hopes of speech
improvement. To address this gap in knowledge, we have gathered surgical records and pre-operative audio
recordings of patients with DFD to quantitatively characterize their speech. In this proposal, we present
preliminary data identifying anatomical thresholds for significant articulation errors. Based on these data, we
hypothesize that speech distortions correlate with severity of anterior-posterior and vertical jaw
disharmonies, and that corrective surgery yields long-term improvement in speech. We propose the
following aims to address this hypothesis and explore the relationship between correction of jaw disharmonies
and speech. Aim 1: To examine the relationship between underbite (Class III) and open bite jaw disharmonies,
and speech distortion. Aim 2: To assess short- and long-term effects of corrective orthognathic surgery on
speech distortion in patients with underbite and open bite.
Training approach: Dr. Jacox is a dual-trained clinician-scientist, who completed dental school in parallel with
graduate school at Harvard School of Dental Medicine (HSDM- DMD) and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences
(GSAS- PhD). In addition, she is a certified diplomate of the American Board of Orthodontics. Her research
program and focus of this application was inspired by a patient seeking treatment `to help her talk
normally', whereby an evidence-based treatment option was not clear. The mentoring plan for this K08
award is designed to ensure Dr. Jacox will be a well-rounded and successful independent clinician-scientist
following completion of the activities in this proposal. Dr. Jacox has assembled a strong mentoring team to guide
her professional development and the establishment of her independent research program. Two co-mentors and
four consultants from diverse yet appropriate scientific and professional backgrounds will assist in the completion
of the training and scientific activities. Scientific interactions as well as didactic training in speech science and
technologies of speech science will add to Dr. Jacox's strong foundation in clinical orthodontics and the biology
of dentofacial disharmonies. These growth opportunities will allow for successful completion of the proposed
experiments, while the professional development activities will complement the training activities and provide Dr.
Jacox with skills necessary to thrive in academics and launch her independent research program."

University and Shaw University, as initial site/target institutions. Additional sites will be recruited if this
proposal is funded. Through the creation of the Genomic Research and Data Science Center for Computation
and Cloud-Computing (GRADS-4C) we will develop and disseminate cloud-based CGDSCC instructional
materials produced with our GRADS-4C affiliated faculty to Target Institutions. This will be accomplished
through the establishment of lasting partnerships with target institutions interested in education, facilitation of
faculty development and student educational and research training in CGDSCC. We shall also develop and
disseminate additional cloud based open source CGDSCC educational resources that can be used with NIH
workflows for the Target Institutions. We are particularly well-prepared to undertake the proposed work due to
the unique team of expert scientists, educators, collaborators, and advisors we have assembled. This innovative
work seeks to formally train the future workforce from underserved populations at minority institutions in
cutting edge CGDS and cloud computing education and hand-on research which has not been attempted or
accomplished before particularly with MSI’s as lead institution. Successful completion of this project will be of
high significance, since it will boost greater overall capacity and critical engagement from an expanded, more

Flash radiotherapy, the delivery of high radiation dose (10 – 30 Gy) at ultra-high dose rates (40 – 200
Gy/s), has recently been shown to reduce significantly normal tissue toxicity compared to conventional
irradiation, while maintaining tumor control probability at similar level. Great excitement has since ensued
about the transformative potential of FLASH radiotherapy. However, the biological mechanisms of FLASH
irradiation (FLASH effect) are not well understood. The clinical translation of FLASH irradiation
necessitates comprehensive laboratory studies to elucidate the biological effects as well as pertinent
technological and physical requirements. At present, FLASH research employs complex accelerator
technologies of limited accessibilities. We propose to develop a novel self-shielded x-ray irradiation cabinet
system, as an enabling technology to greatly enhance the preclinical research capabilities of the radiation
research community. The system employs two commercially available high capacity 150 kV fluoroscopy
x-ray sources with rotating anode technology in a parallel-opposed arrangement. For a medium less than
2 cm in thickness, the system can deliver both FLASH and conventional dose-rate radiations to support a
broad range of laboratory radiation research. We submit our proposal as an academic-industrial
partnership (AIP) to design and construct the first FLASH kilo-voltage x-ray cabinet system for preclinical
laboratory research. The AIP consists of Johns Hopkins University (JHU) with the expertise in radiation
physics, dosimetry, Monte Carlo simulation, robotics, and preclinical radiation research, Xstrahl to
manufacture and commercialize the FLASH cabinet system for preclinical research, and University of
Pennsylvania (UPenn) to support in-field validation of the novel system. A JHU patent application is
currently under review. Our specific aim for the 4-year research efforts are: (1) Design a new self-shielded
pre-clinical radiation research system based on in-depth characterization of the dosimetric properties of
the x-ray beam for both FLASH and conventional radiations, and the mechanical requirements of the
system to support small and large radiation fields. (2) Develop a Monte-Carlo based dose calculation
system to provide information on the delivered dose, dose rate, and LET distributions in the irradiated
target, pertinent to FLASH research. (3) Conduct in-field validation, at JHU and UPenn, of the system
dosimetric performance, and demonstrate the system capability for FLASH and conventional irradiation of
in-vivo models. The successful development of the system by the AIP will make available transformative
FLASH capabilities for the laboratory researchers, and significantly enhance mechanistic and translational
research on FLASH irradiation."

 Intestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), celiac disease, and infectious colitis are
associated with epithelial barrier dysfunction that contribute to diarrhea and nutrient malabsorption. Tight
junctions seal spaces between epithelial cells and maintain barrier function by controlling paracellular flux. The
claudin family of tight junction proteins is critical in defining the tight junction barrier to ions and small
molecules. In the gastrointestinal tract, claudin-2 and -15 are particularly important in their role regulating
paracellular sodium flux and their altered expression can contribute to intestinal disease development.
 Using a novel patch clamp technique, we demonstrated that claudin-2 and -15 form gated Na+ selective ion
channels in the paracellular space. This is important because it demonstrates that claudins have properties
similar to transmembrane ion channels. However, we have limited understanding of how these cation selective
claudins contribute to charge and size selective paracellular pores, how these two claudins function singly or
together to impact intestinal function, and how they impact disease processes. To address these questions, we
built all-atom computer models for claudin-2 and -15 which allowed us to model both claudin structure and pore
function. These models also helped us to identify several first-in-class claudin channel blockers that block the
pore at low micromolar concentrations.
 We propose to use these unique and novel computational and small molecule inhibitor tools to investigate
how claudin-2 and -15 channels control monovalent cation flux across the tight junction, and how they may
differentially regulate cation transport in health and disease. In Aim 1, we will use our claudin-2 and -15
computer models and channel blockers to determine key molecular and structural features that dictate size and
charge selectivity. In Aim 2, we will use our existing and new claudin channel blockers to define the individual
and combined contributions of claudin-2 and -15 to normal intestinal physiology and disease presentation and
development. We will determine the role of claudin-2 and -15 channels in Na+-coupled nutrient co-transport-
mediated barrier regulation, mouse models of colitis, and in human IBD. Completion of this line of study is
expected to contribute positively to human health by providing key insight into how these channels mediate
nutrient absorption, contribute to diarrhea in the setting of colitis, and potentially aid in the development of
novel therapies."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is characterized by an extensive desmoplastic stroma that represents
a major challenge for its effective treatment and improved survival of patients. We seek to define the composition
and roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the most abundant cell population in the PDA stroma, as a
potential avenue for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Although CAFs have been historically
considered tumor-promoting components, their ablation in pre-clinical and clinical studies have led to mixed
outcomes, indicating the poorly understood complexity of CAFs. To investigate CAF biology, we previously
established a pancreatic tumor organoid/fibroblast co-culture model. In addition, we performed single cell RNA-
sequencing (scRNA-seq) of murine and human PDA specimens to characterize CAF composition at single-cell
resolution. These analyses have revealed that fibroblasts are heterogeneous and comprised of at least three
distinct subtypes with unique transcriptional and functional features. More so, this heterogeneity emphasizes the
need to design therapies that selectively target the tumor-promoting CAF populations. Although our work has
started to reveal the complex heterogeneity of fibroblasts in primary or metastatic PDA tissues, iterative
developments in scRNA-seq and analysis methods have revealed four additional CAF subtypes in primary and
metastatic PDA. To comprehensively define the CAF repertoire in primary and metastatic PDA, we will
systematically differentiate CAF subtypes and their regulatory elements using scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq,
machine-learning computational methods, and in situ tissue analytic methods that detect RNA and protein
species, such as imaging mass cytometry (Aim 1). We hypothesize that a deeper understanding of the dynamic
CAF states that occurs in primary and metastatic PDA will guide the selection of specific therapeutic regimens.
To complement this analysis, we will identify new CAF subtypes and study their dynamics in a novel murine
model with a reversible mutant Kras allele (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will study CAF-activating pathways by
investigating several genes implicated in stromal activation that were revealed using our recently developed
intraductal transplantation model of PDA (Aim 2). These new mediators appear to have roles in PDA progression,
immunosuppression, and stromal activation, and may represent new PDA therapeutic targets. Finally, we have
demonstrated different immunomodulatory functions of distinct CAF subtypes. We will test combinatorial
strategies to target distinct CAF subtypes in the PDA microenvironment, and study the effect of these strategies
on tumor progression in a murine PDA model (Aim 3). In addition, we will assess the role of macrophage-CAF
crosstalk in promoting and maintaining CAF identify. Overall, this project will clarify the diversity of PDA CAFs
and the role of cancer cells in regulating CAF subtypes. Our results will provide new avenues for CAF-targeting
that we intend to translate towards improved therapies for patients afflicted by this lethal disease."

circuits [7-24]. However, there is a significant gap when it comes to understanding neurobiological underpinnings
of PFC-insular-striatal alterations at a micro-architectural level (i.e., synaptic plasticity or synaptic density).
Notwithstanding current gaps, preclinical and clinical literature suggests there is significant neurobiological
overlap between substance use disorders (SUDs) and BED, such as alterations in similar areas [25, 26], similar
clinical features (e.g., compulsive food or drug intake) [27-29], and potential common pharmacological
interventions (e.g., lisdexamfetamine, topiramate, and phentermine for cocaine use disorder and BED) [30-38].
Preclinical studies show the capacity of certain pharmacological agents, including stimulants, to produce micro-
architectural changes in fronto-insular-striatal structures as well as an association between synaptic
density/dendritic branching in pyramidal cells of the PFC and working memory, reversal learning, and behavioral
flexibility [39-54]. At a clinical level, our group has developed a novel radiotracer, 11C-UCB-J, for imaging
synaptic density in the living human brain using positron-emission tomography (PET) [55-58]. Thus, the current
exploratory/developmental (PA-21-235) R21 aims to measure for the first time synaptic density in the PFC,
insular cortex, and ventral striatum of unmedicated BED subjects (N =18), as compared to Healthy
Controls (HCs; N =18), using 11C-UCB-J PET. BED participants will undergo single 11C-UCB-J PET scans as
outpatients and HC data will be obtained from previous and ongoing studies. BED participants will also complete
cognitive and behavioral assessments based on Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) positive valence and
cognitive systems as well as assessments of BED severity and eating questionnaires. We hypothesize that
synaptic density will be decreased in four a priori PFC areas (i.e., anterior cingulate cortex, ventromedial PFC,
dorsolateral PFC, and lateral orbitofrontal cortex), in the insular cortex, and in the ventral striatum in BED as
compared to HC subjects. We also hypothesize no changes in white matter regions such as centrum semiovale.
In exploratory aims, we also will explore: 1) correlations between 11C-UCB-J PET outcomes and BED severity
as well as measures of behavioral/cognitive functioning, 2) differences in synaptic density between BED and
2a) CUD and 2b) obese (OB) and lean groups from previous and ongoing studies and 3) whole-brain differences
between BED and HC groups using general linear model (GLM) and independent component analysis (ICA). If
funded, this will be the first translational study examining synaptic density in vivo in adults with BED. Positive
results could inform future studies on biomarker’s development as well as studies elucidating mechanisms of
action of treatments and longitudinal natures of changes in synaptic density."

This R21 proposal seeks to develop a cell-size-based MRI technique, Selective Size MR Imaging using Filters
via diffusion Times (SSIFT), as a novel approach for imaging brain metastases (BM) in patients with high
specificity, and to evaluate its potential to differentiate recurrent BM from radiation necrosis (RN) induced by
stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Approximately 10–30% of all cancer patients will eventually develop BM in
their lifetime, and SRS is a common treatment for patients with BM to improve the local control. However,
about 10-20% of treated BM will eventually develop new contrast-enhancing lesions that are either RN or
recurrent BM. These two types of lesions usually occur within a similar time frame but need to be treated
differently: RN can be managed conservatively to alleviate symptoms; by contrast, tumor recurrence is often
managed with surgery or further radiation to control tumor progression. Unfortunately, RN is indistinguishable
from tumor recurrence on standard-of-care MRI with gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agents due to the
breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in both types of lesions. Therefore, there is a need for clinical
radiation oncology to develop a reliable non-invasive imaging method to differentiate tumor recurrence from
RN. Despite numerous attempts to develop a variety of advanced imaging methods to tackle this clinical
challenge, there is still no single imaging method that has been widely accepted as a reliable imaging
biomarker. We hereby propose a new idea, i.e., to use endogenous information on cell size to differentiate BM
from RN. Different from our previous quantitative cell size MRI with a long scan time, we propose here a fast
SSIFT method that serves as a cell-size-based filter to selectively emphasize signals arising from large cancer
cells with simultaneous suppression of signals from other brain abnormalities, such as RN. We have validated
SSIFT in preclinical animal models to demonstrate its ability to differentiate BM from RN, but it remains unclear
if SSIFT will work in patients with BM. We hereby hypothesize that SSIFT is a practical, reliable, and specific
approach for imaging BM in patients with the capability to differentiate recurrent BM from RN. To test this
hypothesis, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team and propose [Aim 1] to refine a reliable and efficient
SSIFT protocol in imaging BM patients and [Aim 2] to evaluate the clinical ability of SSIFT in differentiating
recurrent BM from RN induced by SRS. Upon completion, the proposed study will break new ground to
establish a new type of cell-size-based MRI technique geared towards addressing an important, common
dilemma in the management of BM patients with SRS treatments. In addition, the ability to differentiate BM
from peri-tumor edema makes this new method another possible alternative imaging approach for BM patients
with kidney dysfunction who are not candidates for gadolinium-agent-based MRI."

The responsive neurostimulation system (RNS) is the first FDA-approved bi-directional brain-computer
interface. Developed to treat drug-resistant epilepsy, RNS is an implanted device that automatically records
and detects electrographic seizures, then rapidly delivers electrical stimulation to suppress seizure activity.
Although the general therapeutic benefit of RNS is well-established, predicting the magnitude and timing of a
potential clinical response for each individual patient is difficult. It may take several months for a patient to
report a reliable change in seizure status, during which time the programming clinician has no objective
guidance regarding whether or not to adjust settings. Although chronic intracranial EEG recordings obtained by
the RNS device provide an ongoing window into the neurophysiological state of a patient’s seizure network,
there is little knowledge about how to use these recordings in individual patients. Thus, a critical need exists to
develop methods for using a patient’s own data to predict when seizure reduction should be expected or to
confirm objectively the presence and maintenance of a clinical response. Using RNS recordings, we recently
made the first discovery of putative electrophysiological biomarkers that indicate and potentially predict
therapeutic response to therapy in individual patients. By visually inspecting the spectral content of >5000 RNS
recordings that captured putative seizures, we identified a distinct category of electrographic seizure pattern
modulation (ESPM) that was always present in responders and never present in non-responders. In some
cases, these ESPMs were observed in RNS recordings prior to patient-reported seizure reduction, suggesting
their potential utilization in predicting therapeutic response. These putative biomarkers, however, cannot be
identified using the standard RNS clinical user interface. To overcome these data analytic barriers to therapy
optimization, we created a software concept for understanding patient-specific RNS performance using
intracranial recordings and interpolation of device-recorded data (BRAINStim). Our proposal adds state-of-the-
art expertise in machine learning and neural signal processing to develop technology for ESPM detection,
characterization, and validation. In the R61 Phase, using recordings from a cohort of 60 subjects (10 pediatric),
we will create tools for automatic detection of ESPMs and perform preliminary biomarker validation according
to the following Contexts of Use: 1) prediction biomarkers that signal impending clinical response to RNS, prior
to patient-reported seizure improvement, which would prevent premature programming decisions, and 2)
response biomarkers that can be used to confirm patient-reported outcomes during stimulation and medication
adjustments. In the R33 Phase, we will validate ESPM biomarkers in recordings from an extended cohort of
170 subjects (45 pediatric), to justify the use of ESPMs as RNS biomarkers in routine clinical care and novel
clinical trials, which will accelerate and improve seizure outcomes, in both adults and children."

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, with
prevalence rates ranging from 5-10% globally. With rising diagnosis rates in the last two decades, childhood
ADHD has become a significant social and financial burden to affected individuals, families, and society at
large. ADHD is characterized by impairments in cognitive control, with adverse life-long consequences for
academic and social functioning. Cognitive control requires dynamic engagement of proactive and reactive
control processes, and aberrancies in these processes underlie behavioral deficits, including elevated
response variability and slow stopping speed. A related line of research suggests that rewards may increase
stopping speed and reduce response variability in ADHD, with some individuals even reaching similar
performance as typically developing children (TDC). However, the cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying
proactive and reactive control, their modulation by reward and relation to clinical symptoms in ADHD are
unknown. Here we develop an innovative multi-componential cognitive, neuroscience, and
computational framework to address this gap and advance fundamental understanding of dysfunctional brain
circuits linking cognitive control and reward systems in children with ADHD. Recent progress in cognitive and
computational neuroscience has demonstrated that cognitive control relies on dynamic brain states
characterized by dynamic interactions in functional brain circuits. The proposed studies will rigorously test
theoretical cognitive and neuroscience models of ADHD by examining reward modulation of proactive and
reactive control as well as dynamic brain circuits involving cognitive control, default mode and reward systems
in children with ADHD. We will integrate multiple high-impact lines of our ongoing research on cognitive
control, children with ADHD, and brain circuit dynamics. Importantly, we will leverage multiple novel
computational models to uncover dynamics of cognitive and brain processes. The proposed studies will: (1)
investigate how reward modulates proactive and reactive control in children with ADHD, (2) determine how
aberrations in reward modulation of proactive and reactive control are related to core clinical symptoms, (3)
characterize dynamic brain circuits underlying reward modulation of proactive and reactive control in children
with ADHD, (4) determine how reward modulation of dynamic brain circuits involving cognitive control and
reward systems are related to core symptoms, (5) identify multivariate cognitive and neurobiological features
for classification of childhood ADHD and prediction of core clinical symptoms of ADHD. The proposed studies
will facilitate a deeper understanding of cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying reward modulation of
cognitive control, which will facilitate developing more effective and precise intervention for childhood ADHD in
the future. Our cognitive, neuroscience and computational framework developed here can be widely applied to
study many psychiatric disorders that manifest similar cognitive deficits, such as schizophrenia and autism."

Hand flexor tendon injuries are common and often occur in a young working-age population resulting in considerable
disability and economic impact. Surgical direct repair immediately after tendon injury is the clinical standard in practice.
However, clinical and functional outcomes following tendon repair remain unsatisfactory due to restrictive adhesions and
poor digital motion, often resulting in multiple surgical revisions, such as tenolysis or tendon grafting. It is known that
both intrinsic and extrinsic healing mechanisms are involved in flexor tendon healing. Intrinsic healing is accomplished
by cellular productivities from the cells within the tendon resulting in fewer adhesions and better function. In contrast,
extrinsic healing relies on the healing from outside tissues, leading to adhesion and scar formations that bond to the
tendon with surrounding tissues and diminish hand function. Therefore, research strategies to improve clinical outcomes
have focused on either enhancing intrinsic healing or eliminating extrinsic healing, or a combination of both. It is also
recognized that some intrinsic healing elements (IHE) involve tendon intrinsic healing capacity including flexor
vinculum (FV) for tendon blood supply and epitenon cells (ECs) within the tendon for tendon regeneration. However, it
is still unknown if and how these IHEs would affect the intrinsic healing ability. Since the IHEs can be damaged during
tendon injury, it is critical to better understand the intrinsic healing associated with IHEs, which not only help to bridge
the scientific gap between clinic and research in this field, but also improve the intervention strategy development.
Recently, we have successfully developed a novel turkey animal model, which is similar to the human flexor tendon in
size, anatomy, structure, function, and most importantly the intrinsic healing capacity. This unique animal model provides
an ideal opportunity to investigate the effects of the IHE on tendon intrinsic healing. Furthermore, we have recently
explored a purified exosome product (PEP) developed by Mayo Center for Regenerative Medicine in the ISO-5 Good
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Facility to improve tendon intrinsic healing with promising results. We have also
developed a lubricating barrier material using carbodiimide derivatized synovial fluid plus gelatin (cd-SF-G) to reduce
adhesions in the tendon graft; but it has not been tested in flexor repair model. Therefore, Aim 1 of this proposal is to
determine the role of two major factors of IHEs including FV and ECs on tendon healing and functional restoration using
our novel turkey flexor tendon injury model. This specific aim, if successful, we will address a critical barrier for the
understanding of flexor tendon intrinsic healing mechanism and advance the current knowledge in hand surgery. Aim 2
will define the effectiveness of our novel interventions using PEP for enhancing intrinsic healing ability and cd-SF-G for
preventing extrinsic healing to reduce scar and adhesion formations using our new turkey animal model. If successful, we
will have developed and validated the clinically translational interventions to improve functional outcomes following
flexor tendon repair, since both our therapeutics, GMP grade PEP and native SF based material, are one step close to a
clinical trial. Thus, the proposal has a significant impact on both basic science research and clinical translation."

 Our R01 application entitled, “Improving pediatric brain tumor treatments using FLASH radiotherapy” is
 focused on translating a novel irradiation modality into clinical practice. Here we will test whether radiation
 delivered in ultra-high dose rate (one-tenth of second), which far exceed the dose rate used in current clinical
 practice (minutes), can significantly reduce normal tissue toxicities associated with the radiotherapeutic
 management of childhood medulloblastoma (MB). The overarching goal is to alleviate the long term
 neurocognitive and cerebrovascular complications that compromise the quality of life of MB survivors while
 maintaining tumor control. To achieve these goals, we will undertake studies using clinically relevant FLASH
 and conventional radiation regimens. Two distinct human MB tumor models will be orthotopically implanted
 in the brain of nude mice to investigate simultaneously tumor response and neurocognitive function after
 irradiation. In addition, for long-term follow up, tumor-free mice will also be subjected to cranial irradiation
 using FLASH or conventional dose rate irradiation. Short-term (1-month) and longer term (4-6 months) studies
 conducted on tumor bearing and tumor free mice respectively, will critically evaluate tumor control,
 neurocognitive, cerebrovascular and molecular outcomes in these cohorts. Preclinical studies investigating the
 response of MB tumors, behavioral performance on multiple learning and memory tasks, vascular structure and
 integrity and the sparing of the neurogenic niche will unambiguously elucidate many of the mechanisms
 underlying the neuroprotective effects of FLASH radiotherapy. Data derived from these collaborative studies
 between UCI and the CHUV will facilitate the clinical translation of FLASH-RT to pediatric oncology, where
 despite the favorable prognosis of children diagnosed with MB, survivors still suffer a lifetime of complications
 caused by their prior radiotherapy, a scenario we hope to ameliorate with our innovative FLASH technology."
10872193,"Abstract:
 Gap junctions are integral membrane proteins that enable the direct cytoplasmic exchange of ions and low
molecular-mass metabolites between adjacent cells. They provide a pathway for propagating and/or amplifying
the signal transduction cascades triggered by cytokines, growth factors, and other cell signaling molecules
involved in growth regulation and development. Dysfunctional intercellular communication via gap junctions has
been implicated in causing many human diseases. The objective of this project is to use a multi-disciplinary
approach to identify the key intrinsic regulatory mechanisms that are responsible for Cx43 and Cx45 function.
The central hypothesis is that unique intermolecular interactions within the divergent CT domain of connexins
affect gap junction regulation. More specifically, we hypothesize that after myocardial infarction, differential
regulation of Cx43 and Cx45 involves specific phosphorylations and protein interactions of their CT domain. The
significance of this proposal is that discovery of how interactions mediated by the CT domain can be modulated
would open the door to strategies to ameliorate pathological effects of altered connexin regulation in the failing
heart. The following Specific Aims are proposed to investigate this concept: 1) What drives Cx43 away from gap
junctions/intercalated discs in vitro and in a murine model of myocardial infarction? and 2) What promotes Cx45
gap junction/intercalated disc localization and is Cx45 expression in left ventricle hypertrophy after myocardial
infarction an arrhythmogenic substrate? Upon completion of this project, we expect to describe novel
mechanisms by which phosphorylation and protein partners regulate Cx43 and Cx45 function and strategies by
which the pathological effects of Pyk2, Src, and Cx45 upregulation in failing hearts may be lessened."
10866522,"Project Summary: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive, debilitating disease for
which new, disease-modifying treatments are desperately needed. Since drug targets supported by human
genetic evidence are more likely to lead to FDA-approved treatments, functional characterization of genome-
wide association study (GWAS) loci is a translational research priority. Our group has played a leading role
in COPD GWAS, and the largest COPD GWAS to date has identified 82 significant loci, most of which have
not been functionally characterized. In the first phase of this project, we combined emphysema GWAS results
with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, using GWAS-eQTL colocalization methods to identify
COPD GWAS target genes. This approach allowed us to prioritize TGFB2 and ACVR1B for functional studies
in airway epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts that identified functional variants in these loci. However, >50%
of COPD GWAS loci have not yet shown strong colocalization with eQTLs, due in part to inherent limitations
of eQTLs which depend on gene-level expression quantifications that do not reflect effects of alternative
splicing. Alternative splicing is an important functional mechanism for GWAS loci, perhaps equally as
important as eQTLs. In the next phase of this project, we propose to identify novel COPD-associated genetic
variants that alter splicing (sQTLs) and characterize their isoform-specific effects. In Aim 1, we will perform
genome-wide discovery of splicing QTLs (sQTLs) using two RNA-seq resources with large numbers of
subjects with COPD – blood RNA-seq from 4,515 subjects in the COPDGene Study and lung RNA-seq from
1,078 subjects in the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC). Using colocalization methods, we will
identify novel COPD GWAS target genes whose splicing is altered by COPD-associated genetic variants. In
Aim 2, we will identify differentially expressed and differentially used isoforms in COPD using estimated
isoform quantifications from short read lung tissue RNA-seq in 1,078 COPD cases and controls in the LTRC.
We will then generate Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long read RNA-seq for 10 COPD GWAS genes
in 80 LTRC subjects with COPD and 80 controls using a targeted enrichment approach. In Aim 3, we will
combine fine mapping and functional studies to identify COPD GWAS variants that alter splicing in primary
lung cells. First, we will use targeted long read RNA-seq to characterize the cell-type specific isoform
profiles of COPD GWAS target genes in four primary lung cell types. We will then functionally validate fine-
mapped COPD GWAS variants using splicing reporter assays, and we will characterize the effects of these
variants on COPD-related cellular phenotypes in airway epithelial cells selected by genotype from the Marsico
Lung Institute cell bank. Our multi-disciplinary research team has the requisite expertise in COPD genetics
and genomics, molecular biology, long read sequencing, splicing and RNA biology to complete this important
project to identify novel COPD GWAS target genes involved in alternative splicing."

Despite major efforts to keep operating rooms sterile, surgical site infections (SSIs) remain a serious and stub-
born problem, killing up to 8,200 patients a year in the U.S. Our long-term goal is to develop novel therapies that
effectively minimize risk of SSIs and promote wound healing. During the previous funding cycles of this award,
we have demonstrated that i) successful encapsulation and sustained release of vitamin D and other immuno-
modulating compounds induced higher cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) gene and protein (hCAP18/LL-
37) levels in immune cells and keratinocytes in cell culture, a human CAMP transgenic mouse wound model and
human skin explants; ii) topical vitamin D increased killing of Staphylococcus aureus in a skin wound-infection
model using our human CAMP transgenic mouse; and iii) exosomes secreted from immune cells treated with
vitamin D contained higher levels of hCAP18/LL-37. Furthermore, we developed a novel gas-foaming expansion
technique to fabricate improved 3D nanofiber scaffolds eluting vitamin D that promoted immune cell infiltration,
induced hCAP18/LL-37, decreased inflammation, and promoted neovascularization and collagen deposition in
human immune system-engrafted mice. Building on these findings, and our preliminary data, the goal of our
proposal focuses on the development of nanofiber-based dressings for enhancing innate immunity. Our over-
arching hypothesis is that co-encapsulating immunomodulating compounds with exosomes secreted from
treated immune cells in 3D nanofiber scaffolds will synergistically enhance protection against SSIs and promote
wound healing better than either component alone. To accomplish this, there are three specific aims: 1) Demon-
strate efficient encapsulation and elution of immunomodulating compounds from our improved 3D nanofiber
scaffolds; 2) Determine the antimicrobial and wound-healing efficacy of exosomes derived from primed or human
CAMP transfected immune cells; and 3) Demonstrate the efficacy of immunomodulating compounds and exo-
somes - co-incorporated 3D nanofiber scaffolds to promote healing and prevent infection in our humanized trans-
genic mouse model and ex vivo human skin explants. Building on work from our prior grant, we expect successful
completion of the aims in this renewal will lay a strong foundation for developing the next generation of novel
therapeutic anti-infective wound dressings that could greatly speed healing, reduce rates of SSIs and minimize
development of antibiotic resistance. We also expect these dressings could serve as effective treatments for
traumatic and combat-related injuries."

CANDIDATE: Michael P. Thompson, PhD, is an epidemiologist, health services researcher, and faculty
member in the Department of Cardiac Surgery at the University of Michigan. His long-term career goal is to
conduct impactful, significant, and innovative research that improves the value of cardiac surgery. The
proposed K01 award application includes a 5-year plan for career development and research activities needed
to achieve this career goal and become a successful independent investigator.
BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a multi-disciplinary, evidence-based intervention that improves
outcomes, but has not been widely adopted. Among cardiac surgical patients, clinical trials have demonstrated
that CR extends life, improves cardiovascular function and quality of life, and prevents downstream health care
utilization. Despite this evidence, half of cardiac surgical patients never attend a single session of CR, and only
one-third of CR enrollees finish the entire 36 recommended sessions. Disparities in CR enrollment across have
also been demonstrated across patients, providers, and geographic regions. Improving CR enrollment is
critical to ensuring its full potential for cardiac surgical patients.
RESEARCH AIMS: My long-term goal is to improve the value of cardiac surgical care. The aims of this study
are: (1) to identify determinants of CR enrollment after cardiac surgery, (2) to measure the effect of CR
enrollment after cardiac surgery on clinical and economic outcomes, and (3) to estimate the impact of financial
incentives on CR enrollment after cardiac surgery. In order to achieve these objectives, we propose a series of
quantitative analyses on a unique combination of claims data and clinical data from the IMPROVE Network,
which shares data and best practices across five multicenter cardiovascular quality collaboratives covering
over 90 hospitals in 9 states (~10% of all US cardiac surgical programs).
TRAINING AIMS: Three training aims have been proposed to facilitate the proposal. (1) To gain a deeper
understanding of cardiac surgical care delivery. (2) To gain causal inference skills with in-depth comparative
effectiveness and policy evaluation components. (3) To develop skills and experience in implementation
science methods.
IMPACT: Findings from this proposal will provide evidence needed to develop the necessary evidence to
appropriately expand and incentivize CR enrollment after cardiac surgery, which will increase the value of
cardiac surgical care. The proposal is directly responsive to AHRQ’s interest in (i) generating evidence that will
increase the affordability, efficiency, and quality of health and (ii) health services research to achieve a high-
value healthcare system. Above all, the proposed research strategy, career development plan, mentorship,
and institutional environment will cultivate my growth into an independent health services researcher."

Recent progress has been made on understanding the role of the innate immune system in the pathogenesis
of Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, the role of adaptive immunity in the periphery and the central nervous
system in AD remains largely unexplored. Therefore, a critical next step is to understand the interaction
between innate and adaptive immunity, and its impact on brain aging and neurodegeneration. Previous work
has shown that clonally expanded CD8+ T cells are present in the peripheral blood and the cerebrospinal fluid
of patients with AD. In our ongoing work, utilizing single cell profiling of human brain immune cells, we
expanded this observation and identified cell type changes of the adaptive and innate immune system in the
brain parenchyma of AD derived samples. In addition, published and ongoing work from our group provides
evidence in humans and mice that astrocyte and adaptive immune cell-sourced interleukin-3 (IL-3) programs
microglia to ameliorate the pathology of AD. Further analysis of the interaction between innate and adaptive
immunity in humans and mice is needed to mechanistically understand its role in AD at different stages of the
disease.
Studying the interaction between innate and adaptive immunity in AD in humans is challenging due to limited
availability of fresh tissue specimens. Over the last 5 years, our team has established a pipeline to isolate
immune cells from fresh brain tissue to generate multiscale single cell data. Building on our expertise and
existing resources, here we propose to perform multi-tissue single cell multiomics and spatial transcriptomics
of immune cells from AD cases and healthy controls. To gain additional mechanistic insights into the
interactions between adaptive and innate immunity, we will perform parallel studies in AD mouse models. In
Aim 1, we will examine the diversity, abundance and spatial location of adaptive and innate immune cells
across the brain-barrier-blood axis (brain, meninges, choroid plexus, and peripheral blood) to identify
differences in the composition, phenotype, and antigen specificity of adaptive immunity (T and B cells) in AD
that are shared or distinct across tissues. In Aim 2, we will explore the interactome of adaptive and innate
immune systems in the brain-barrier-blood axis to identify differential cell-to-cell interaction networks in AD,
pointing to gain or loss of ligand-receptor relationships among immune cell subpopulations. In Aim 3, we will
mechanistically delineate intercellular crosstalk between adaptive immune cells and central innate immune
cells in murine models of AD. Collectively, these studies will enable us, at unprecedented resolution, to explore
the adaptive and innate immune response in AD cases and provide a putative mechanistic explanation for our
observations by utilizing mouse models. Importantly, our work will provide the scientific community with an
urgently needed resource for adaptive and innate immunity in the central nervous system that can be utilized in
future studies."

The overall goal of this 4-year K23 proposal is to support Dr. Stephani Stancil to become an independent
investigator in the field of pharmacodynamic biomarker development to support quantitative early-stage drug
development in pediatric neuropsychopharmacology, specifically eating disorder therapeutics. This proposal
aligns with NIMH’s prioritization of and the National Advisory Mental Health Council workgroup
recommendations for quantitative pharmacologic early-stage trials, particularly in vulnerable populations.
Eating disorders (ED), including Bulimia Nervosa, Anorexia Nervosa-Binge/Purge and Binge Eating Disorder,
are characterized by binge eating and purge behaviors (e.g., vomiting), typically begin in adolescence, and
affect up to 5% of teens. EDs are associated with significant morbidity (e.g., malnutrition, cardiac compromise,
development of substance use disorder), have the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness and are not
responsive to current pharmacotherapy. This career development proposal will leverage Dr. Stancil’s clinical
pharmacology expertise in drug exposure inquiry and expand her career focus to clinical
neuropsychopharmacology to enable her to define central nervous system drug action in children and
adolescents. The comprehensive career development plan (CDP) contains three training objectives: 1)
neuroimaging, 2) pediatric randomized clinical trials, and 3) exposure-response modeling, to transition Dr.
Stancil into a successful, independent investigator. The CDP’s structured mentoring, didactic training and
experiential learning will be applied to a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in adolescents with
Binge/Purge ED to accomplish the following aims: Aim 1) Determine the sensitivity of a neuroimaging
biomarker to reward system modulation by opioid antagonism, Aim 2) Develop an Exposure-Response Model
for naltrexone. Dr. Stancil’s career development and research will take place in a highly favorable and well-
suited environment that includes a tertiary academic children’s medical center, children’s research institute,
joint department of pediatrics shared by two regional medical schools, an outstanding imaging center and the
Frontiers CTSA. After completing this project, Dr, Stancil will have advanced the field of pharmacodynamic
biomarker development in pediatric mental health and generated data to support an R01 application to
establish the validity of the proposed pharmacodynamic biomarker. She will be well-positioned to become a
leader in the field of pharmacodynamic biomarker development and exposure-response linkage to de-risk
early-stage drug development and facilitate a precision therapeutics approach to pediatric

10934546,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Neurofibrillary tau is consistently linked to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) over a range of clinical presentations and anatomical phenotypes, including patients with primary
impairment in memory, visuospatial, language, and somatomotor domains. One model of tau progression that
has attracted recent attention involves region-to-region transport of pathologic tau along axonal white matter
(WM) connections; however, evidence for axonal transport in murine models may not translate to the complex
biology of AD in humans. One potential test of the axonal transport hypothesis is whether changes in WM
connections predict disease progression between tau-positive and tau-negative regions. If axonal transport is a
common mechanism of tau spread, it should leave signature WM changes consistent with a patient’s
anatomical and clinical phenotype. However, WM changes are underinvestigated in non-amnestic mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD and rarely studied in the context of longitudinal tau changes. Moreover,
imaging markers of WM change may reflect features of the AD pathologic process or co-occurring
cerebrovascular disease. We propose a multimodal clinical, imaging, and pathologic investigation to test the
hypothesis that WM changes predict region-to-region tau spread independent of CVD. Aim 1 will combine
longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of tau progression with 3-Tesla MR imaging of WM
changes using diffusion MRI to assess evidence that WM changes mediate tau spread in a syndrome-specific
manner. The axonal transport model predicts that longitudinal changes in diffusion MRI will mediate region-to-
region tau PET progression in syndrome-specific brain networks. Aim 2 will use high-resolution 7-Tesla MRI of
CVD-related brain changes, including WM hyperintensities and microbleeds, to quantify vascular disease
burden across amnestic and non-amnestic AD and to assess CVD co-pathology as a potential confound that
would explain WM changes in AD. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that all clinical variants of AD
will exhibit age-related CVD including WM hyperintensities and microbleeds but will not fully explain tau-related
WM changes. Finally, Aim 3 will provide postmortem validation of imaging findings and advance digital
pathologic methods to quantify AD- and CVD-related pathology in amnestic and non-amnestic AD. In this aim,
the axonal transport model predicts that longitudinal change in grey matter tau will be mediated by tau
deposition and degeneration in connecting WM tracts, but not by CVD pathologic burden. By comparing
heterogeneous phenotypes and cognitive networks, we seek to demonstrate that WM-mediated tau spread is a
generalizable mechanism of disease progression across cognitive subtypes of MCI/AD and is independent of
CVD-related changes. This research will contribute to multiple milestones in AD and related dementias (ADRD)
by investigating relationships between tau, CVD, and WM change (Milestones 2.L and 2.S); and developing
non-invasive markers for longitudinal tracking of CVD-related brain changes (Milestone 9.R)."

The overall goal of this NCI K08 career development proposal is to facilitate Dr. Miranda Lam’s development into an
independent investigator in oncology health policy research focused on understanding factors and policies that impact the
quality and cost of cancer care. Her proposed project aims to characterize the variation in radiation oncology spending,
utilization, and quality across the U.S. and identify strategies used by high-value radiation oncology practices.
The primary objectives are to 1) identify and characterize variation in radiation oncology spending, utilization, and quality
for cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy, 2) specifically investigate whether disparities in spending, utilization and
quality of radiation oncology exist for dual-eligible patients, who are older on Medicare and low-income or disabled on
Medicaid, and 3) elucidate approaches and strategies used by high- vs. low-value practices. A comprehensive evaluation
and analysis of variation in spending, utilization, and quality of radiation oncology practices is the first step to optimizing
cancer care delivery with radiation treatments across the U.S. Identifying the differences in approaches to care and
barriers encountered by high- vs low-value practices are critically important for physicians, patients, hospital leaders, and
policymakers. While the current mandatory Radiation Oncology Alternative Payment Model (RO APM) by Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) is on hold, alternative payment and delivery models are impacting oncology. This project
will be timely and provide CMS and practices with valuable data to adjust or inform any future APMs in the future, as
necessary to ensure successful transition without negatively impacting the quality of cancer care. Even if the current form
of the RO APM is not implemented at this time, understanding variation in high- and low-value practices will still be
valuable to determine whether certain practices need additional support to continue to provide high-value care for their
cancer patients.
In Aim 1 of the proposed study, the investigator will analyze Medicare claims data to characterize the variation in
spending, utilization, and quality for patients undergoing radiation therapy for cancer treatments. She will systematically
and comprehensively evaluate radiation oncology practices. In Aim 2, she will delve into whether there are differences in
spending, utilization, and quality for dual-eligible patients. Finally, in Aim 3, she will perform key informant interviews
of high- and low-value practices to elucidate differences in management, leadership, and care delivery."

Project Summary/Abstract: This K01 career development award will provide Dr. Pratscher mentored training experiences that will accelerate his transition to independence as a productive researcher investigating complementary and integrative approaches for chronic pain, whole person health, and emotional well-being. Chronic pain is a major source of human suffering, and chronic low back pain (cLBP) is one of the most common, costly, and burdensome pain conditions. Pain is a sensory and affective experience, and psychosocial factors, such as emotional distress (e.g., depression), stressful life events (e.g., trauma), and unexpressed emotions (e.g., anger), contribute substantially to the persistence of pain. There is an urgent need for integrative treatments that address this complexity of chronic pain and provide significant and lasting pain relief. Breathwork interventions (i.e., therapeutic breathing practices) are promising treatments because they incorporate one of our most integrated physiological processes, respiration, to simultaneously address both physical and emotional causes and consequences of chronic pain. Therefore, the aims of the proposed research are to 1) develop and refine a multicomponent breathwork intervention (derived from Guided Respiration Mindfulness Therapy) and to 2) iteratively evaluate its feasibility and acceptability in people with cLBP. Specifically, we will modify a treatment manual to guide intervention sessions and adapt treatment fidelity evaluations to assess therapist competence and adherence to the manual. Then, we will conduct three single-arm iterations of the 8-week, individually delivered intervention, followed by a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the most refined version of the intervention to usual care. Upon completion of each iteration, we will gather quantitative and qualitative data and meet with a panel of experts to discuss possible modifications to the intervention or protocol before proceeding with the next iteration. This work will result in a refined and reproducible multicomponent breathwork intervention that can be tested for efficacy in future research, which the candidate plans to pursue with an R-level application written during this award period. The University of Florida has a thriving clinical pain research environment that will support the candidate in completing the proposed research and career development plan. Guidance from an excellent mentoring team in addition to several training activities (e.g., seminars, conferences, independent study) will allow Dr. Pratscher to accomplish the following objectives: (1) build a foundation of knowledge in chronic pain research with emphases on biopsychosocial treatment factors; (2) obtain expertise in the processes of intervention development, refinement, and testing; and (3) enhance proficiency in the design and conduct of clinical trials to develop into a successful independent principal investigator. By completing the proposed project and training activities, Dr. Pratscher will become an independent scientist and leader in the field of breathwork interventions for chronic pain and whole person health."
10908400,"Since the early 1990s, the field of childhood obesity has known that children gain 3-5 times more weight during
their 3-month summer vacation than they do during the entire 9-month school year. Evidence shows that youth
from low-income households are especially vulnerable to accelerated BMI gain during the summer. The cohort
study we seek to extend in this renewal R01 is What’s UP (Undermining Prevention) with Summer. This is
the largest and most diverse study of elementary-age children designed to understand accelerated BMI gain
during the summer. In this R01, children are measured on key obesity-related health behaviors (i.e., activity,
sleep, screen time, time spent sedentary, and diet) during school year (April/May) and in the summer (July).
What’s UP with Summer advances the field of accelerated BMI gain during the summer by 1) measuring the
SAME children during school and again during summer over multiple years using a within-person design; 2)
measuring height/weight at the beginning and end of each summer over time to examine changes in BMI gain
during the school year and compare this to BMI gain during the summer; and 3) leveraging rich time/date
stamped 24hr accelerometry data and combining this with daily time diary recordings of where children are, what
times they are there, when and what they eat, and who they are with. Accelerated BMI gain is not a phenomenon
that occurs only in elementary-age children. Suggestive, yet limited, data suggest that middle and high school-
age youth also exhibit accelerated BMI gain during the summer. Unlike elementary-age children, important
differences in autonomy and decision making occur during these formative adolescent years. The major gaps
in the science are few studies measure key health behaviors during the school and summer in middle and high
school youth and limited information exists about the social and setting contextual influences on middle and high
school health behaviors over the summer and how they impact changes in BMI. Without information collected
as proposed in this renewal application, the ability to design effective public health interventions to address
obesity during the summer for adolescents is severely limited. In this R01 we will compare longitudinal changes
in BMI z-scores and health behaviors during school and summer and from elementary school to high school,
identify individual, peer, family/home, neighborhood, and school/community influences on BMI z-scores and
health behaviors during school and summer from elementary school to high school, and qualitatively explore
changes in adolescents’ BMI and health behaviors during the summer and school. This project is significant
because it will extend a well-established existing cohort to identify the impact of an understudied timeframe
(summer) associated with accelerated BMI gain during a developmental period for which no information exists
(adolescence). This project is innovative because it will capture information on the same youth during school
and summer, follow them over time, and collect contextually rich information to understand and identify
modifiable factors to inform the design of behavioral interventions."
10908430,"Project Summary
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) remains a major threat to global health. Therefore, it is essential
that we fully understand the mechanism of viral infectivity to provide new avenues for therapeutic development.
After invading a non-dividing host cell, HIV-1 must gain access to the genetic vault, the nucleus. To do this, the
viral genes, packaged in a capsid assembly, need to pass through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). NPCs are
massive protein channels that function as the gatekeepers of the cell nucleus. However, how the HIV-1 capsid
breaches the barrier formed by the NPC remains poorly understood. Previous studies were hampered by the
complexity of the NPC structure and the lack of molecular-level details of capsid-nucleoporin interactions; there
was also a general inability of conventional in vitro platforms to capture the structural complexity of the viral
capsid, which presents patterns that are recognized by host factors. Therefore, unlocking more mechanistic
details of HIV-1 nuclear entry calls for innovative in vitro approaches capable of recapitulating higher-order
capsid assemblies and the native environment of nuclear pores. We propose to establish such a platform by
leveraging our recently established DNA-origami-based NPC mimics, termed NuPODs (NucleoPorins
Organized by DNA), which contain precisely controlled pore dimensions and nucleoporins grafted with
programmable density and orientation, as well as the programmable capsid protein (CA) assemblies that
faithfully recreate selective fragments or the entire HIV-1 capsid surface. We will further validate our in vitro
findings by infectivity experiments and live-cell imaging. Our multi-investigator team will draw from our
respective expertise, including HIV biochemistry, structural biology, DNA nanotechnology, nuclear transport,
and live-cell imaging, to build and apply this enabling platform for the study of HIV-1 capsid nuclear transport.
Specifically, we will first comprehensively study the interactions between HIV-1 capsids and an assortment of
cellular factors involved in HIV-1 nuclear import (Aim 1). Using soluble high-order CA assemblies and
recombinant nucleoporins, we will define the biochemical and structural basis of capsid-nucleoporin binding,
laying the foundation for the rest of the study. We will then build a library of NuPODs with increasing structural
and compositional complexity, to identify the key determinants of HIV-1 nuclear import and the associated
remodeling of the viral capsid and the NPC (Aim 2). These NuPODs will be built with multiple types of
nucleoporins positioned at designated positions on a DNA-origami channel with tunable dimensions and
stiffness. Systematically varying the NuPOD design and analyzing the resultant NuPOD-capsid docking and
insertion will help understand HIV-1 nuclear import with molecular-level details. Additionally, we will validate
our key findings using cell-based virologic experiments (Aim 3). Overall, we expect this project to create
powerful tools that will not only help define the mechanism of HIV nuclear entry, but also enable us to explore
the nuclear transport of many other viruses."
10846820,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Patients with cancer represent one of the most vulnerable populations in our healthcare system. Not only
do such individuals face a life-threatening diagnosis, but the toxicities of treatment regimens place cancer
patients at additional risk for adverse outcomes. Additionally, most cancer patients experience inadequately
treated pain, despite pharmacologic interventions by clinicians to address pain.
 The use of germline pharmacogenomic information offers a potential solution to better inform therapeutic
decision-making. Many consider it an ideal discipline by which to advance and examine the clinical application
of genomic medicine. Nevertheless, preemptive germline pharmacogenomic testing does not currently
constitute the standard of care before utilization of most anti-cancer therapies, nor for pain prescribing. One of
the most frequently cited reasons is the lack of prospective randomized data demonstrating its utility.
 We posit that preemptive genotyping and the upfront use of pharmacogenomic information offers the
potential to improve cancer care. We hypothesize that providing germline pharmacogenomic information
along with clinical decision support will guide personalized chemotherapy and pain medication
choices and dosing decisions, reduce toxicity, and result in improved patient outcomes.
 We propose to leverage our existing institutional infrastructure and two strengths of the University of
Chicago (pharmacogenomics, oncology) by performing the first known broad prospective randomized studies
of germline pharmacogenomics in oncology. We will recruit patients preparing to initiate cancer chemotherapy
or pain treatment who have one of three major cancer types (gastrointestinal, head and neck, or breast
malignancies), and randomize to upfront pharmacogenomic testing versus no upfront pharmacogenomic
information (usual care).
 Chemotherapy dosing and the incidence of severe toxicities, as well as opioid selection for pain treatment
and pain medication response will be compared between arms. Additionally, we will evaluate whether sharing
of pharmacogenomic results with patients in an informed manner improves patients’ knowledge about and
perceptions of treatment choices and alignment with treatment goals.
 In summary, this proposal will examine and advance the idea that widespread efficacious clinical
translation of genomic discoveries will be actualized both by systems/technology changes as well as the
strategic assessment of genomic knowledge applications within key clinical settings and stakeholder
populations. Future effectiveness and impact on public health will result not just from the findings we generate
but from an improved understanding of decision-making processes involved in promoting and adopting risk-
reductive, customized treatment practices."
10827963,"Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1) has been estimated to infect 15-20 million individuals worldwide and is known to be the etiological agent of an adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), an inflammatory disease syndrome known as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), and pathologies of the lung, skin, eyes, and thyroid gland. HTLV-1 is notorious for being extremely difficult to propagate in cell culture, which has prohibited rigorous analyses of virus replication, including the steps involved in retrovirus assembly. HTLV-1 spread is known to be heavily reliant on virus infection involving cell-to-cell contacts that form what is termed the virological synapse (VS), which represents the primary means for virus spread, including events associated with oral transmission. While HTLV-1 has been previously studied in regard to virus spread via cell-cell contacts, a significant knowledge gap exists regarding the nature of virus particle assembly and transmission via the VS. In general, virus particle spread through cell-cell contacts increases the likelihood of an infection event of virus particles that may possess low particle infectivity in cells without formation of VS. Previous studies have indicated that a low proportion of mature HTLV-1 particles possess an intact capsid core, suggesting that aberrant particle morphology could help to explain the poorly infectious nature of cell-free HTLV- 1. In order to address the current knowledge gap in the field, we propose in this exploratory application to develop workflows for state-of-the-art bioengineering and quantitative imaging technologies that hold high promise in being applied to the efficient study of HTLV-1 particle assembly and spread at the VS. First, we will develop a workflow for the use of cell micropatterning technology in order to reproducibly and efficiently create cell-cell contacts and investigate the role virus budding in virus spread. Second, we propose to establish an efficient workflow in which we can view cell-cell contacts utilizing high-resolution cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy in order to investigate the role of host cell proteins in virus assembly at cell-cell contacts. Development of these workflows will allow for quantitative analysis of virus particle biogenesis at cell-cell contacts. These technologies have broad applicability in virology and the success of this research will be applicable to a variety of questions regarding virus replication and virus-host cell interactions."
10904876,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) causes frequent and severe infections in hospitalized patients. In addition,
the prevalence of multidrug-resistant PA is increasing and is now between 15-30% in many areas. Thus, it is
not surprising that the IDSA, WHO, and the CDC have each listed PA as serious public health priority in need
of new therapeutic agents. An age-old question concerning PA is why some strains cause substantially more
aggressive infections than others. The recent application of next generation sequencing platforms to this
problem has begun to provide an explanation by demonstrating that PA genomes differ substantially from
strain to strain. Approximately 10-15% of the genes in a typical PA strain are ""accessory,"" meaning that they
are present in some strains but not others. Likewise, the ""core"" or conserved genome contains numerous
single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertion-deletions (indels). Although a few of these accessory
genes and core alleles have been characterized and shown to modulate virulence, they represent the ""tip of
the iceberg."" A systematic examination of strain-to-strain differences in PA is likely to uncover a wealth of novel
virulence-impacting genes and alleles. Identification of these would have several important consequences: (i)
They would dramatically enhance our understanding of PA virulence and the mechanisms by which this
bacterium causes severe disease; and (ii) they would allow one to predict the virulence of PA strains based on
the complement of accessory and core virulence genes/alleles that were present in their genomes.
 We hypothesize that application of comparative genomic approaches to large numbers of PA isolates will
identify novel virulence genes/alleles and allow the generation of machine learning models to predict the
virulence of PA isolates based on their genomes. We will perform the following specific aims to test these
hypotheses: (1) Use machine learning models to predict the virulence of PA isolates based upon their
genomic content. (2) Identify accessory genes and core genome SNVs/indels that play a causal role in
virulence. (3) Develop a genome-based model that predicts clinical outcomes in patients with PA
bloodstream infections. The impact of this proposal is twofold. First, it will lay the foundation for future
models that provide valuable prognostic information to clinicians treating PA-infected patients. Second, it will
identify new PA virulence factors that mediate novel pathogenic mechanisms of infection."
10856206,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Multiple sclerosis (MS), one of the most common nontraumatic disabling neurological disorders, affects 309
per 100,000 adults in the United States, yet currently no cure exists. This is partly due to a lack of sensitive
biomarkers for detecting disease-related changes, which impairs the development of effective treatments. One
potential solution to this issue is to image oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), the ratio of oxygen a tissue extracts
from the blood. As OEF directly quantifies tissue viability and functional activities, it can serve as a useful
biomarker for better understanding, monitoring, and predicting prognosis of neurological disorders including MS.
For instance, progressive neurodegeneration is a critical hallmark of MS. Though the comprehensive mechanism
is not yet clear, it may be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction and/or sustained inflammation in chronic active
MS lesions. Recently, our studies on quantitative mapping of OEF (qmOEF) suggested that the regional
mitochondrial dysfunction and lesion inflammation activity can be measured by decreased and increased OEF,
respectively. These findings highlight the capability of qmOEF to study progressive neurodegeneration in MS.
 However, no qmOEF technique is currently available in a routine clinical setting. The reference standard,
positron emission tomography (PET), is critically limited in availability and has poor spatial resolution. Moreover,
although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely available, current MRI-based methods suffer from poor
sensitivity and clinically impractical data acquisition. Recently, we proposed a novel MRI-based qmOEF
technique with high clinical potential. It utilizes a routine sequence available on current MRI scanners and
eliminates the need for impractical multiple gas inhalations. By integrating quantitative susceptibility mapping
(QSM) modeling of often neglected MRI phase signal and quantitative blood level dependent (qBOLD) modeling
of magnitude signal, our model (QSM+qBOLD=QQ) can estimate OEF by distinguishing deoxyheme iron in
venous vasculature from other diffusive susceptibility sources. In our preliminary data, we validated QQ against
15O-PET in healthy adults and demonstrated OEF abnormalities in MS, ischemic stroke, brain tumor, dementia,
pre-eclampsia, and hydrocephalus. However, for clinical use, the QQ methodology should be improved to ensure
accurate OEF measurements as unreliable model assumptions in QQ, including negligible water diffusion and a
fixed vasculature (e.g., numerous randomly oriented long cylinders), hinder accurate estimation of OEF.
 In this project, we aim to establish a clinically readily applicable, validated MRI toolset for qmOEF that is
available on every MRI scanner, by improving QQ. We will achieve this through 3 specific aims. Aim 1. Develop
a novel, realistic OEF mapping technique (QQ+MR vascular fingerprinting=QQvF). Aim 2. Validate QQvF against
15O PET. Aim 3. Evaluate the feasibility of QQvF in MS patients for disease severity prediction. The novel MRI-
OEF tool developed by this project will contribute to a substantial improvement in understanding, diagnosis, and
treating neurologic disorders, such as MS."

Mucosal surfaces house numerous commensal and symbiotic bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms, which
establish mutually beneficial interactions with their host. This microbial colonization relies on complex
interactions with the innate and adaptive immune systems, including the generation of antibodies against
commensal bacteria antigens. There is a pressing need to understand how adaptive immune responses to
commensals are regulated, and how failure of these mechanisms lead to inflammation and immune pathology.
Recent studies have identified a requirement for toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in B cells in generating anti-
commensal antibodies. We have previously shown that the cell surface receptor integrin αvβ3 and components
of the autophagy pathway regulate TLR signaling in B cells to prevent overexpansion of autoreactive cells and
autoimmunity. In preliminary studies, we have shown that B cell-specific αv-knockout mice (αv-CD19 mice) have
increase numbers of spontaneous germinal centers in the intestine and are more susceptible to inflammatory
colitis. Based on these data, we hypothesize that αvβ3 regulates B cell responses to commensal bacteria to
maintain defense against infection but prevent overactive inflammatory responses. In this application we propose
to test this hypothesis by: (1) measuring anti-commensal antibodies and repertoires in αv-CD19 and control
mice, and following B cell responses after bacterial colonization; (2) determining the mechanism of increased
susceptibility to DSS colitis in αv-CD19 mice. This research is highly significant as it will provide important insights
into mechanisms of regulation of anti-commensal antibody responses, and if successful, will establish a new
paradigm linking dysregulated TLR signaling in B cells to susceptibility to colitis."

The complexities of biological, behavioral, social, and environmental risk factors for obesity and cardiovascular
disease (CVD) necessitate team science, capable of crossing the boundaries of disciplinary-specific silos to
conduct and evaluate research from a transdisciplinary approach to prevent and treat obesity and CVD across
the lifespan. Efforts to facilitate greater collaboration among scientists trained across many fields and levels of
training are not only valuable but also essential to solving such complex problems. Thus, we propose to continue
an innovative, transdisciplinary pre- and postdoctoral training program in obesity and CVD at Washington
University in St. Louis (WUSTL). WUSTL is an excellent research institution promoting transdisciplinary,
translational research through its unique, collegial, scientific environment across campuses and departments.
This program: 1) recruits and trains talented transdisciplinary pre- and postdoctoral trainees; 2) provides trainees
with collaborative, transdisciplinary mentorship teams; 3) targets diversity in the future scientific workforce; and
4) provides training in the ethical and socially responsible conduct of obesity/CVD research. International
authorities on obesity, Denise Wilfley, PhD (Director) and Samuel Klein, MD (Co-Director), lead the program,
supported by highly- qualified, primary and co-mentors spanning 12 departments in the biomedical, cognitive and
behavioral, and population health sciences. Our mentors are well-funded and have strong collaborative ties to
facilitate the training of 4 pre- and 4 postdoctoral trainees each year. Combining pre- and postdoctoral trainees
from diverse backgrounds (e.g., genetics, molecular cell biology, psychology, social work, public heath, and
neurosciences) has created and will continue to create a uniquely dynamic training environment. The WUSTL
Nutrition Obesity Research Center, Institute of Clinical and Translational Sciences, Institute for Public Health,
and Center for Diabetes Translation Research provide infrastructure and state-of-the-art resources to support
trainees' engagement in transformative, translational science. Program evaluations completed by trainees,
program administration, and collaborative mentorship teams ensure trainees achieve short- and long-term
indicators of productivity positioning them for success in obtaining academic positions and independent grants.
Indeed, postdoctoral graduates of the program have been highly successful in obtaining academic positions
and grant funding, and in the case of our predoctoral trainees, continuing their research training in prestigious
positions. The Diversity Advisory Committee informs our approach in the recruitment and retention of highly
qualified trainees from diverse backgrounds. Not only is our training program innovative in its design, but
using a team science approach guided by stellar mentors, our trainees are prepared to create and
contribute to transdisciplinary scientific approaches that are more likely to yield innovative solutions to the
complex problems of obesity and CVD than research previously conducted by individual scientists within a
single disciplinary field."
10898609,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare but life-threatening disease characterized by vascular
remodeling and progressive elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance. These events result in right heart failure,
significant morbidity, and a high mortality. The timing of right ventricular (RV) dilation and dysfunction varies from
patient to patient, even among individuals with otherwise similar RV afterload; however, the biological basis for
this heterogeneity in RV adaptation is not yet known. Identifying and understanding molecular mechanisms of
RV maladaptation are important steps for discovering novel right heart targeted therapy.
Dr. Pi recently explored plasma metabolomic signatures in a deeply phenotyped cohort of PAH participants using
a systems biology approach and found distinct metabolic pathways and profiles associated with metrics of right
heart failure and mortality. In particular, polyamine and histidine metabolism were consistently associated with
these outcomes.
It is important to appreciate that while right heart adaptation is related to right heart failure, it is a distinct condition.
Specifically, right heart failure may merely represent the severity of pulmonary hypertension, while right heart
adaptation reflects the ability or inability of the right heart to respond to any severity of pulmonary vascular
disease. When the metabolomics analyses of right heart failure were adjusted to account for differences in
pulmonary vascular resistance, an association between sphingomyelin metabolism and RV adaptation emerged
in individuals with otherwise similar right heart afterload.
Using the same prospective observational PAH cohort from University of Washington, in this proposal Dr. Pi
aims to extend her metabolomics work by (i) identifying proteomic profiles associated with RV maladaptation
and mortality in PAH; (ii) integrating the multi-omic (metabolomic and proteomic) signals to find dysregulated
pathways and features associated with poor outcomes. Importantly, the scientific aims directly support an
ongoing and rigorous training program in systems biology and bioinformatics that will specifically enhance the
proteomic analysis and integrative omics approaches. Successful completion of this project will generate novel
data and methods that will provide a solid foundation for a K23 proposal focused on RV adaptation and ultimately
an independently funded career leveraging “big data” to understand complex cardiopulmonary disease."

A combination of individual-, network-, community-, and structural-level variables impact all steps in the HIV Care
Continuum, particularly in the Deep South states of Alabama (AL), Louisiana (LA), and Mississippi (MS), which
disproportionately bear the nation's HIV burden while simultaneously having the fewest healthcare resources.
While the individual-level correlates of viral suppression (VS) are well-known, few epidemiologic studies,
especially those that are digitally-based, have examined VS from a multilevel lens that accounts for the role of
geographic and community-level characteristics germane to the Deep South, such as aggregate poverty
measures, racial segregation, and healthcare access. Epidemiological studies also typically exclude people with
HIV (PWH) with non-sustained VS (non-VS) or without recent HIV labs, as these are among the hardest to
identify and reach due to their limited healthcare involvement. Our highly experienced study team will address
these research gaps through the proposed UG3-UH3 study, which will use mHealth technology to optimally
recruit, screen, enroll, and retain a prospective digital cohort of 1000 PWH in AL, LA, and MS with non-VS or
who otherwise lack evidence of having been in care for the previous 12 months, leveraging long-standing
relationships with public health departments in each of these three states. We will assemble a community
advisory board (CAB), consisting of PWH, health department partners, and HIV care team members in the three
states and we will use the Information System Research (ISR) Framework to tailor features of an existing
adherence management app for PWH, WiseApp. We will test usability of the Drive to Zero app prototype with
PWH and informaticians. Eligible cohort participants will be PWH ages ≥18 years, living in AL, LA, or MS, living
with HIV for ≥12 months, and entered in the Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System (eHARS), a standardized
document-based surveillance database used by all state health departments to report diagnosis and outcomes,
with a recorded VL≥200 c/mL ≤12 months or have missing HIV lab values during that same period. Participants
will be followed for three years with iterative annual psychosocial quantitative survey assessments conducted
via the Drive to Zero app to assess predictors, mediators, and moderators for non-VS. We will contextualize
quantitative data by using geospatial analysis, linking participant residence addresses at time of enrollment to
Census tract data. Participants of the digital cohort (n=45) will also be eligible to participate in qualitative in-depth
interviews to contextualize quantitative results. The findings from this study will inform efforts to recruit large,
digital cohorts of PWH and will be among the first to demonstrate effective methods of retaining digital cohorts
for HIV as well as other health conditions. Study findings will also help identify multilevel factors that contribute
to non-VS in the Deep South, thereby elucidating future areas for intervention, and will directly lead to a follow-
up R-level application."

Work from many laboratories has established that DNA sensors – both membrane-localized
Toll-like receptors (e.g. TLR9) and intracellular DNA sensors (e.g. cGAS) – sense herpesvirus
infection. In striking contrast, our knowledge about the physiologic relevance of cytoplasmic
RNA sensors of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) family in the detection of herpesviruses, such as
herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), is rudimentary.
The proposed study builds on a recent discovery by the Gack laboratory that RIG-I plays a
crucial role in the detection and restriction of HSV-1 infection, where RIG-I and intracellular DNA
sensors act in a temporal manner. Furthermore, we identified that during HSV-1 infection the
host-derived 5S ribosomal RNA pseudogene transcript 141 (RNA5SP141) activates RIG-I and
elicits cytokine-mediated antiviral innate immune defense. In collaborative work we recently
identified that ablated RNA5SP141 gene expression is associated with severe HSV-1
encephalitis in humans. Furthermore, we discovered that RNA5SP141 is exported from infected
cells via exosomes and taken up by uninfected cells, where it triggered RIG-I signaling.
Using a coordinated series of molecular, biochemical, and cell biological approaches combined
with CRISPR-gene editing techniques, we will define the role of RNA5SP141 gene expression
in the antiviral innate immune response to HSV-1 infection and in HSV-1-associated disease
(AIM 1). Furthermore, we will elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying RNA5SP141
exosomal loading (AIM 2), and also determine the physiologic relevance of exosomal delivery of
RNA5SP141 in host immunity to HSV-1 infection (AIM 3). Our studies will provide a molecular
understanding of innate immune detection of herpesvirus infection, which may provide the
foundation for new therapeutic approaches or guide the design of novel adjuvants."

Loss of corneal sensory nerves develops secondary to herpes infections, stroke, or trauma; treatments are
often only partially successful and lead to suffering and vision loss. The long-term objective of our research is
to identify the factors that permit the corneal epithelium to reform a stable barrier after trauma so we can
intervene to prevent corneal erosions from forming. Our studies of the cornea have recently focused on the
intraepithelial corneal sensory nerves (ICNs) which consist of the intraepithelial corneal basal nerves (ICBNs)
and the intraepithelial corneal nerve terminals (ICNTs). Mitomycin C (MMC) applied topically at the time of
debridement injury acts as a neuroprotective agent. Corneal epithelial and resident dendritic cells phagocytose
axonal mitochondria (aMito) from severed axons after injury. Apical cell desquamation, ICN growth and ICNT
shedding are under diurnal control. We hypothesize that the ocular surface barrier and the extent of corneal
tissue damage in response to injury and irritants varies with the time of day. We will test this hypothesis in Aim
A by answering the following questions: 1. Does shedding of the ICNTs and the desquamation of squames
occur spontaneously when lights turn on or does it persist in the dark? 2. Do differences in the corneal barrier
and ICN density in the resting and active phase in the mouse impact the extent of damage done to the cornea
and signaling by the ICNs to the trigeminal ganglion in response to injury and after exposure to ocular irritants
The daily shedding and severing the ICNs leads to accumulation of aMito within corneal epithelial cell
lysosomes followed by their degradation via transmitophagy; by contrast to retinal pigment epithelial (RPE)
cells, the mechanisms that regulate phagocytosis of axonal debris in the corneal epithelium are not known.
Data from our lab and others lead us to hypothesize that corneal epithelial cells internalize aMito via LC3B
associated phagocytosis (LAP) and, after internalization, corneal epithelial cells regulate whether aMito
undergo transmitophagy or are retained in their cytoplasm to function metabolically. We test this hypothesis in
Aim B by answering the following questions: 1. Is phagocytosis of aMito and severed axons by corneal
epithelial cells mediated by LAP? 2. Are functional aMito retained in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells after being
transferred from axons into corneal epithelial cells during homeostasis and in response to injury?
The experiments proposed use quantitative in vitro and in vivo cellular and molecular approaches to answer
these questions. The knowledge gained from these studies will not only inform clinicians about the optimal time
of day to deliver treatments for ocular surface disorders, they will also clarify the role that mitochondrial transfer

Diastolic dysfunction (DD), characterized by impaired left ventricular compliance and relaxation, is associated
with increased risk of developing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), a devastating syndrome
with poor prognosis for which there currently exist limited therapeutic interventions. Dynamic acetylation of
histones represents a critical component of chromatin-dependent signal transduction involved in the activation
of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and increased extracellular matrix deposition, leading to progressive DD and
development of HFpEF. These processes are largely regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs), a family of
epigenetic regulatory enzymes whose pharmacological inhibition is cardioprotective in the setting of DD;
however, little is known regarding the HDAC isoform specificity and molecular mechanisms mediating this
protection. This Pathway to Independence award will leverage innovative small molecule inhibitors, genetics-
based strategies for cell type-specific gene ablation, and the integration of multifaceted state-of-the-art
epigenomic and bioinformatics techniques to examine the cell type- and isoform-specificity of HDAC inhibition
(Aims 1 and 2), and therapeutic potential of inhibition of a novel glycan binding protein (Aim 3), in myofibroblast
activation, cardiac fibrosis and DD. In Aims 1 and 2, the applicant will train with co-mentors and advisors in the
K99 phase in a single-cell, genome-wide next generation sequencing technology that characterizes chromatin
architecture, a flow cytometry-based technique for characterizing inflammatory cells, an integrated approach to
transcriptomics and proteomics analyses in primary human CFs, and a genetics-based approach for cell type-
specific gene ablation, all with the overall goal of defining the cellular specificity and molecular mechanisms
mediating the cardioprotective properties of HDAC inhibition. In the R00 phase described in Aim 3, the applicant
will utilize the skills acquired in the K99 phase to investigate the role and therapeutic potential of inhibiting the
glycan-binding protein Galectin-1, recently discovered to be significantly altered in the CF population of mice
with DD and subjected to HDAC inhibition, in myofibroblast activation, cardiac remodeling, and the progression
to HFpEF. The applicant possesses extensive prior knowledge in epigenetics, CF biology, and the
pathophysiology of DD and fibrotic remodeling. Furthermore, the mentorship team consists of internationally
recognized leaders in epigenetic regulation of cardiovascular disease, clinical HFpEF, murine models of HF, and
emerging bioinformatics technologies. The environment at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus
is exemplary for collaborative and innovative research, with an excellent infrastructure including a human heart
biorepository and outstanding core facilities. In summary, the exceptional mentoring team and institutional
environment will provide a solid foundation for the applicant’s development into an independent investigator.
Moreover, this innovative approach offers the exciting potential to contribute to the development of desperately
needed novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of heart failure."

Although most children receive emergency care in general emergency departments (EDs), national studies
have shown that pediatric readiness is low and that the lack of readiness has consequences for clinical quality
and outcomes. Presentation to a highly prepared hospital, one with a high pediatric readiness score, is
associated with decreased in-hospital mortality. Presence of a pediatric emergency care coordinator (PECC) is
associated with increased readiness, but limited data are available to directly assess the association between
PECC status and quality of care for children. Previous work has focused primarily on quality variation among
specialty pediatric centers which account for a minority of care provided to pediatric patients and have very
different staffing and resources as compared to general EDs. Our long-term goal is to develop systems to
improve care for children presenting to general EDs. The goal of this R01 project is to define the hospital-level
characteristics associated with quality of care provided to children in general EDs. We will use a slate of
recently developed process and outcome quality measures across geographically diverse states with high-
quality pediatric data available. Our primary hypothesis is that more intensive pediatric-focused staffing (e.g.
more robust PECC implementation) is associated with higher-quality care and better clinical outcomes for
children. The specific aims are to (1) Identify PECC implementation factors that are associated with variation in
quality of emergency care for children (2) Establish if PECC status is associated with higher quality of care for
children treated in general EDs and (3) Determine if disparities in quality of care by race/ethnicity and
insurance vary by PECC status. The proposed work builds on our pilot work with the National ED Inventory
(NEDI-USA) database, as well as on our team’s strong track record in health services research with large
administrative databases and qualitative and implementation expertise. In the proposed work, we fulfill two of
the primary goals of the NICHD Strategic Plan: (1) “improving child and adolescent health” and (2) addressing
“pervasive disparities…improving approaches in populations that experience specific cultural, social, or access
issues.” These data will provide a critical understanding of the association between PECC, workforce factors,
and quality of care for children. This understanding is the prerequisite for developing evidence-based
interventions to improve outcomes for all children receiving emergency care in general EDs."
10873979,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 CLN3 and CLN6 disease are subtypes of a wider family of pediatric neurodegenerative diseases called
the Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses (NCLs) or Batten Disease. The NCLs affect approximately 6-8 children per
100,000 live births worldwide. Common symptoms of CLN3 and CLN6 disease include vision impairment which
progresses to blindness, seizures which increase in severity, cognitive and motor decline progressing to
dementia, and ultimately premature death. No cure or effective treatment for either CLN3 or CLN6 disease is
known.
 The development of new disease-modifying agents to treat CLN3 and CLN6 disease is an urgent and
unmet medical need. Common phenotypes that are shared between all NCLs include dysfunctional autophagy
leading to accumulation of storage material, reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and
increased ceramide production leading to apoptotic death of neurons, and dysfunctional mitochondria.
 Autophagy and apoptosis are physiological process that contribute to cellular homeostasis. Dysfunction
of one, or in many cases, both processes, is phenotypic across many neurodegenerative diseases in addition
to the NCLs. While targeting either process individually results in promising pharmacological effect, no small
molecule has been identified that is capable of modulating both synergistically. While a multi-target approach
has been used in cancer treatment for many years, it has only recently begun being applied to
neurodegenerative diseases and has yet to be explored in CLN3 and CLN6 disease.
 Through a structure-based approach, we have identified a library of multi-functional compounds that
fuse autophagy activation activity, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 induction and decreased ceramide synthesis resulting in
translational activity to protect human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from externally-
induced and phenotype-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we have shown in our preliminary data that iPSCs
obtained from CLN3 patients and derived to functional neurons recapitulate the aberrant autophagy, apoptosis
and mitochondrial function phenotype of the disease, and that these phenotypes can be rescued by selected
lead compounds. Further, we show proof-of-concept that our lead compounds rescue CLN3 disease
phenotypic behavioral deficits in a transgenic CLN3 mouse model.
 The goal of this application is to optimize our proprietary library of neuroprotective compounds to further
understand their minimum pharmacophore, confer ‘drug-like’ properties, identify and eliminate any potential
toxicity, optimize drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic parameters, further credential their mechanism of
action and demonstrate proof-of-concept protective activity in additional patient iPSC-derived neuron lines and
CLN3 and CLN6 transgenic mice."
10834748,"Project Summary
Cancer cells require the proteins encoded by certain genes in order to proliferate. These “genetic dependencies”
are promising targets for therapeutic intervention, as drugs that block the function of a dependency can induce
apoptosis and durable tumor regression. The discovery and characterization of genetic dependencies and the
drugs that can inhibit them are key goals of preclinical cancer research.
My laboratory has investigated multiple putative genetic dependencies using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis. We
have found that verified mutagenesis of many cancer drug targets fails to recapitulate published results obtained
when these genes were knocked down with RNAi. Moreover, we find that multiple “targeted inhibitors” currently
in clinical trials continue to kill cancer cells harboring CRISPR-induced null mutations in their reported targets,
demonstrating pervasive off-target cell killing among clinical inhibitors. These results – coupled with the
observation that 97% of drug-indication pairs that enter clinical trials in oncology fail to receive FDA approval -
suggest the existence of fundamental shortcomings in how cancer genetic dependencies are identified and
studied. In this work, we will develop a robust, preclinical target validation pipeline to characterize both the
consequences of loss-of-function alterations in potential drug targets and to validate on-target activity of putative
clinical inhibitors. In particular, we will select genes that are reported to be cancer dependencies and that are
targeted by small-molecule inhibitors, and we will study the cellular consequences of their deletion or inhibition
(Aim 1). Next, we will use cells harboring CRISPR-induced knockouts of these putative drug targets to investigate
the chemical inhibitors that had been used to target them (Aim 2). If these reagents continue to kill cells that
totally lack their reported targets, then this would indicate that they induce cell death through an off-target
mechanism. Then, we will deploy both spontaneous- and CRISPR-directed mutagenesis in order to generate
mutations that confer resistance to these small-molecule inhibitors, thereby helping to identify their true cellular
targets (Aim 3). Finally, by isolating drug-resistance mutations, we have discovered that one mischaracterized
anti-cancer drug is in fact the first potent and specific inhibitor of the CDK11B kinase to be described. Using this
knowledge, we will seek to identify biomarkers that can predict therapeutic responses to this drug (Aim 4). In
total, these experiments will delineate a robust preclinical pipeline for target validation, shed light on the genetic
architecture that underlies cancer-essential genes, and allow drug re-purposing studies of multiple clinical
inhibitors by uncovering their true targets."
10829923,"Therapeutic Targeting of a Major Immune Resistance Pathway in Triple-negative Breast Cancer
Abstract
Checkpoint blockade results in moderate survival benefit in a subset of patients with triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC) but most patients currently fail to benefit from immunotherapy. We recently discovered that the
genes encoding the integrin αV and SOX4 proteins (ITGAV and SOX4 genes) render tumor cells resistant to
killing by cytotoxic T cells. Integrin αVβ6 and SOX4 form a resistance pathway that is particularly relevant to
TNBC: Integrin αVβ6 releases TGFβ from an inactive latent complex by a force-dependent mechanism, and
active TGFβ induces expression of the SOX4 transcription factor that inhibits T cell-mediated tumor immunity.
The integrin αVβ6 heterodimer is expressed at a low level by healthy epithelial cells, but its expression is
highly upregulated in many epithelial cancers, including TNBC. TGFβ is an important immunosuppressive
cytokine in human tumors, but has been difficult to target due to its pleiotropic biology in different cell types and
tissues. This approach provides an opportunity for more selective targeting of TGFβ for cancer
immunotherapy. Our preliminary data demonstrate that an integrin αVβ6 blocking mAb inhibits SOX4
expression and sensitizes TNBC cells to cytotoxic T cells. This antibody confers a substantial survival benefit
in two aggressive mouse models of TNBC that are resistant to checkpoint blockade. In Aim 1, we will study
the integrin αVβ6 – SOX4 resistance pathway as an immunotherapy target in aggressive and highly metastatic
mouse models of TNBC. In particular, we will examine how inhibition of integrin αVβ6 induces a substantial
influx of CD8 T cells into TNBCs that are poorly infiltrated by T cells. In Aim 2, we will investigate the
molecular mechanisms by which the integrin αVβ6 – SOX4 pathway inhibits T cell-mediated tumor immunity.
Preliminary data demonstrate that the SOX4 transcription factor inhibits expression of genes from multiple
innate immune pathways in tumor cells, including the cytosolic dsRNA and dsDNA sensing pathways as well
as the type 1 interferon response pathway. We will define the direct transcriptional targets of SOX4 and study
how SOX4 cooperates with other transcription factors to render tumor cells resistant to T cell-mediated tumor
immunity. In Aim 3, we will study the significance of the integrin αVβ6 – SOX4 pathway in human TNBC. Our
hypothesis is that this resistance pathway inhibits T cell infiltration in human TNBC, and we will therefore
examine the spatial relationship between integrin αVβ6/SOX4 expression and T cell infiltration in human TNBC
specimens. High-affinity integrin αVβ6 antibodies and a small molecule inhibitor are already being tested in
clinical trials for fibrosis indications. The studies described here could thus provide the scientific rationale for
testing of such inhibitors in TNBC and other human cancers of epithelial origin."
10894297,"Transcriptomic mechanisms underlying the immune modulating function and therapeutic efficacy
 of PARP inhibitors
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPis) are approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer, as
well as BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) mutant breast and pancreatic cancers. Our current understanding is that
one of the main mechanisms responsible for the efficacy of PARPis is through synthetic lethality, specifically in
cancers with homologous recombination repair defects (‘BRCAness’). While PARP1-mediated PARylation is
an essential regulator of gene transcription, it remains unknown how PARPi-induced transcriptomic changes
contribute to its therapeutic efficacy. While our preclinical and clinical studies assessing PARPis in combination
with programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)/PD-1 inhibitors (PD-1/L1is) showed durable responses in
different cancers, the responses were heterogeneous between patients, and surprisingly, the therapeutic
benefit of this combination did not correlate with known predictive biomarkers for PARPis, such as BRCA1/2
mutations. These data suggest that the immunomodulating function of PARPis may be different from or
independent of the existing ‘BRCAness’ paradigm underlying the therapeutic efficacy of PARPis.
To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the immunomodulating function of PARPis, we utilized
single-cell RNA sequencing to assess the transcriptomic impact of PARPis on tumor cells and the tumor
immune microenvironment. Surprisingly, we identified that PARPi-induced PARP1-trapping to DNA may
upregulate B7-H3 (CD276), a key immune checkpoint protein. Based on our preliminary studies, we
hypothesize that PARPis transcriptionally regulate cancer-cell intrinsic B7-H3 expression by trapping the
PARP1 protein to the B7-H3 promoter region, which may serve as a key regulatory node for the
immunomodulating function and therapeutic efficacy of PARPis. We will use cell and animal models, as well as
patient specimens from clinical trials of PARPi-based therapies to test this hypothesis. We will test three aims:
Aim 1: Determine mechanisms by which PARPis transcriptionally induce cancer cell intrinsic B7-H3
expression through PARP1-chromatin trapping. Aim 2: Determine if B7-H3 functions as a key regulatory node
for the immunomodulating function and efficacy of PARPis in preclinical animal models. Aim 3: Validate
PARPi-induced B7-H3 expression as a biomarker in determining the efficacy of PARPis as immunomodulating
agents by analysing patient tumor and blood samples from multiple clinical trials. We believe that our proposal
is highly innovative because it fills key gaps in our knowledge of the therapeutic efficacy of PARPis as
immunomodulating agents through transcriptional regulation, which goes beyond the current mechanistic
paradigm of PARPis. If successful, our study will have a significant impact on expanding the clinical
applications of PARPis as immunomodulating agents by promoting antitumor immunity and enhancing the
efficacy of immunotherapy. This may also lead to the clinical development of rational PARPi combinations with
an B7-H3 inhibitor and/or a PD-1/L1i, depending on the immune characteristics of the individual patient tumor."
10897260,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Gender minority populations, who have a gender identity that differs from their assigned sex at birth, including
transgender, gender nonconforming, and nonbinary people, face 2-4 times greater risk of substance use and
adverse mental health outcomes (e.g., eating disorder symptoms) than cisgender (that is, non-gender minority)
populations. To mitigate these severe but understudied disparities, it is critical to identify effective preventive
interventions for gender minorities, particularly in emerging adulthood, a critical developmental period offering
unique risks as well as opportunities for substance use prevention. Research suggests several relevant targets
for preventive interventions in this age group. This includes the role of social stressors (e.g., anti-transgender
stigma, including online), targeted marketing, and sociocultural appearance ideals (e.g., pressure for men to
look “masculine,” women to look “feminine”), both of which can exacerbate body dissatisfaction, which has
been linked to substance use and adverse mental health outcomes in gender minorities. Online environments,
especially social media (e.g., Instagram), offer unprecedented access to supportive resources for gender
minority emerging adults, but also provide new channels for harmful exposure to stigmatizing messages,
targeted marketing by alcohol and tobacco industries, and sociocultural appearance ideals. It is not known how
social media should be leveraged to prevent substance use among gender minority emerging adults. To date,
no intervention has been developed to address the unique impact of online stressors (e.g., stigma) and
resilience factors (e.g., social support) on body dissatisfaction and substance use for GM emerging adults. In
response to these research gaps, my long-term goal is to develop, test, and disseminate effective interventions
for substance use prevention among gender minority young people. My objective for this proposal is to obtain
training in (1) theory and methods for research on social media and health behaviors, (2) technology-based
behavioral intervention development and testing, and (3) community-engaged research, which I will apply to
the proposed research. Responding to the NIH FY 2021-2025 Strategic Plan to Advance Research on the
Health and Well-being of Sexual and Gender Minorities and informed by the Minority Stress Theory, Gender
Affirmation Framework, and Transactional Model of social media effects, the specific aims of this research are
to: 1) investigate gender minority emerging adult (18-25 years) experiences and intervention needs related to
social media, body dissatisfaction and substance use; and 2) engage a community advisory board (CAB) to
develop a brief, online-administered social media intervention to reduce body dissatisfaction and substance
use risk in gender minority emerging adults and test the intervention for feasibility and acceptability. The
intensive career development training and the research findings from this study will lay the groundwork for
future testing and dissemination of intervention materials tailored to the needs of this underserved population."
10846768,"ABSTRACT
The tendon-bone interface is a structurally graded fibrocartilage interface that is critical for transducing
mechanical loads from muscle to the skeleton. Reduced muscle loading can lead to impaired interface growth
and skeletal deformities. Recently, we have shown that the size of tendon-bone interfaces in the embryonic
mouse limb are negatively regulated by fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9), and skeletal muscle-specific knockout
of FGF9 phenocopies the effects we see in global FGF9 mutants. These strong preliminary findings have led us
to hypothesize that FGF signaling, mediated by muscle specific FGF9, contributes to interface growth in a non-
cell autonomous manner. However, it remains unclear if and how FGF signaling between adjacent muscle,
tendon, and bone alters the behavior of interface progenitor cells, or whether interface growth is secondary to
FGF-mediated changes to mechanical loading from muscle. In this proposal, we will use innovative mouse
models for FGF ligand- and receptor-loss of function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) in tissue-specific Cre
alleles to isolate the cell population required for FGF-induced changes. We will rigorously compare the structural
(i.e., microcomputed tomography), cellular/ECM (i.e., histomorphology) and biomechanical properties (i.e.,
tensile, indentation tests) of the tendon-bone interface in LOF/GOF genotypes and controls. We will test FGFR-
dependent mechanoresponsive structural adaptation of interfaces following muscle unloading using chemical
denervation or increased muscle loading using optogenetic stimulation. In this project, we will use innovative, in
vivo optogenetics to induce repetitive skeletal muscle contraction in neonatal mice using pulsed blue light, a
technique we established with recent NIH R03 support. This approach, combined with novel FGFR LOF/GOF
mouse models, will allow us to determine the role of FGF signaling in muscle loading induced adaptation of the
tendon-bone interface. We aim to (1) demonstrate muscle-derived Fgf9 is responsible for regulating the
development of tendon-bone interfaces during embryonic and postnatal growth and (2) Establish the mechanism
by which cell-specific FGF signaling regulates loading-induced structural adaptations of tendon-bone interfaces.
This R01 proposal will establish the non-cell autonomous contributions of Fgf9 in interface growth and
structure/function of tendon-bone interfaces as well as the cell autonomous roles of FGFR signaling in interface
growth and mechanical adaptation. Additionally, findings from this work will identify both conserved and unique
downstream signaling pathways associated with FGF receptors that guide postnatal growth of tendon-bone
interfaces."

Cushing Disease (CD) is a life-threatening “orphan disease” caused by an adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenoma driving excess adrenal cortisol production. There is a large unmet medical
need for CD treatment. However, translational research has been greatly hampered due to unavailability of any
human pituitary corticotroph tumor cell models. Using single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) and microarray
transcriptome analysis of surgically resected human corticotroph tumors, we observed that loss of pituitary
corticotroph tumor ACTH secretion coincided with reduced angiogenesis, survival signals and immune
responses in parallel with increased collagen catabolism, cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization.
Guided by these findings, we developed a unique 3-dimensional (3D) pituitary tumor culture system and for the
first time, we have been able to generate 3D human corticotroph tumor cultures that secrete ACTH >4 months.
We have assembled an experienced multidisciplinary team to complete 3 focused specific aims using this first
of its kind resource. Firstly, we will use whole exome sequencing to characterize the genomic landscape of our
corticotroph 3D culture biobank and compare genomic and genetic fidelity between the original corticotroph
tumor, normal blood and matched 3D corticotroph tumoroid cultures from the same individual patient.
ScRNAseq analysis of serial passages of individual patient-derived corticotroph tumor cultures will monitor for
transcriptome changes in a temporal fashion over the course of culture. The histopathological structure of our
3D corticotroph cultures at the single cell level will quantify tissue architecture so we can map corticotroph
tumoroid cellular composition and distribution. A second aim will employ a miniaturized automated system to
conduct a high throughput drug screen in our 3D corticotroph tumor cultures. Compounds will be subjected to
rigorous evaluation to define primary “hits” and validated by re-screening in triplicate using 20 concentrations
from 100µM to 20pM (2-fold dilution) to reliably calculate an EC50 for each compound. Finally, three
complementary approaches, computational cheminformatic profiling, scRNAseq to delineate transcriptomic
changes at the single cell level following drug treatment and functional genomics will be employed to explore
the MOA of validated hit compounds. This integrated interrogation of our drug screen results and the genetic
features of our patient-derived 3D tumor cultures as well as that of the original tumor tissue, will allow us to
disentangle an individual drug's mode(s) of action, and directly document drug sensitivity of individualized
parental corticotroph tumors. In summary, we will use our unique biobank of comprehensively molecularly
characterized pituitary corticotroph tumor tissues and paired derived 3D corticotroph tumor cultures to test
libraries of clincially relevant compounds. This pituitary 3D tumor culture system is transformative in the field
due to the lack of any human pituitary corticotroph tumor cell models and will pave the path for much needed
improved therapy for patients with this dreadfully disabling and often fatal disorder, Cushing disease."
10831452,"Targeting microglia to alleviate Alzheimer’s Disease pathobiology
Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of age-related dementia leading to irreversible
neurodegeneration and cognitive decline with no cure or effective preventive measures. Autophagy is a
conserved, cell response found in all eukaryotic cells. Several studies in AD showed that autophagy activity is
compromised in neuronal cells and suggested that this leads to reduced clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) and
neurotoxicity. Few reports examined autophagy activity in the AD brain and suggested that autophagy is
dysfunctional in neurons, however, the contribution of autophagy in microglia, the immune cell of the brain, is
unclear. Our newly generated data that was recently published show that autophagy is impaired in adult microglia
from AD mice. More importantly, we found that a specific microRNA (miRNA), that targets several autophagy
molecules, is upregulated in the brain of AD patients when compared to non-AD individuals, as well as in the
brain and microglia-derived from an AD mouse model. Increased expression of this specific miRNA in the AD
brain leads to down-regulation of autophagy effectors, which is then responsible for reduced clearance of Aβ by
microglia. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanism underlying elevated expression of the miR. In Aim 2, we
will investigate the functional consequences of reducing this miR in the brain of AD mouse and the mechanism
by which the microRNA is upregulated in AD brain. We will determine the behavior of microglia isolated from
treated mice. These experiments will be performed using the AD mouse model 5XFAD and human samples from
AD and non-AD patients. Our proposal will characterize a novel drug target and mode of delivery for AD."

The long-term goal of this project is to develop, characterize, and validate genetically modified marmoset
models of sporadic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will serve as tools for investigating molecular and cellular
disease mechanisms, and for identifying therapeutic targets. AD is the most common cause of dementia, with
the majority of cases (~95%) appearing to be sporadic, which is caused by complex interactions between
multiple gene variants and environmental factors. Numerous models of AD have been developed (e.g., mice);
these models are primarily focused on familial forms of AD and have enabled significant progress toward
understanding AD, but they fail to recapitulate the full spectrum of molecular, cellular, behavioral, and cognitive
pathologies observed in AD and provide poor predictive value when trying to translate findings to human
clinical trials. Several lines of evidence suggest that marmosets may effectively bridge the gap between mice
and humans for both basic and translational neuroscience research. First, marmosets and humans have very
similar brain structures, cognitive/social behavioral repertoires, metabolism, and immune functions. Second,
compared to other primates, marmosets have short lifespan, small body size, and high reproductive power.
Finally, gene editing tools are now available to generate various types of genetically modified marmosets.
Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest risk factor for late-onset, sporadic AD and also increases the age-
dependent risk of monogenic familial AD and incidence of AD in women. There are three APOE alleles in
humans with the APOE*ε4 allele conferring increased risk and the APOE*ε2 allele conferring decreased risk
relative to the common APOE*ε3 allele. APOE isoforms differentially modulate both amyloid-β (Aβ)-dependent
and Aβ-independent pathways to affect brain homeostasis, including tau-mediated neurodegeneration,
microglial inflammation, lipid transport, synaptic integrity, glucose metabolism and cerebrovascular function.
These three APOE alleles differ with regard to cysteine (C) and arginine (R) amino acids at positions 112 and
158 (C112/C158 in APOE2; C112/R158 in APOE3; and R112/R158 in APOE4). Several lines of evidence
demonstrate that R61 is critical for APOE4-mediated AD risk. Marmoset APOE (mAPOE) is encoded by a
single allele and contains the equivalent of R112 and R158, but lacks the critical R61 equivalent (it contains T
instead), suggesting that it behaves like human APOE3. To test this hypothesis, mAPOE T61R mutant protein
was generated to test the effect on inflammatory responses induced by lipopolysaccharides in microglial cells.
The mAPOE T61R variant resulted in a more robust response compared to wild type mAPOE. Similar results
were found when human APOE4 was used (APOE4>APOE3). Taken together, these preliminary results
indicate that mAPOE T61R is functionally equivalent to human APOE4. Further, several pairs of CRISPR
gRNAs for generating an APOE null mutation have been identified. To investigate the role of APOE in
sporadic AD in the marmoset, APOE null and T61R mutant marmosets will be generated and characterized."

 Neural crest cells are an important stem-like cell population characterized by their multipotency and
migratory ability. Originating within the forming central nervous system, neural crest cells undergo a
spatiotemporally regulated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to leave the neural tube and become
migratory. They then migrate extensively throughout the developing embryo, giving rise to a wide range of
derivatives as diverse as elements of the craniofacial skeleton and peripheral nervous system. In the post-
migratory phase, neural crest cells condense into different structures, a process that involves loss of migratory
characteristics, perhaps reflecting the reverse of the EMT process. While neural crest EMT has been studied
extensively, the mechanisms underlying the condensation of neural crest cells to form final derivatives is far less
well characterized. To address this knowledge gap, we propose to identify transcriptional changes that
occur during gangliogenesis with the goal of identifying those mediating alterations in intercellular
adhesion required for neural crest condensation into peripheral ganglia. Our hypothesis is that the gene
regulatory mechanisms that play a role during peripheral ganglion formation may reflect a reversal of the EMT
process. The goal is to uncover the molecular mechanisms that drive condensation of neural crest cells into
ganglia. These may in turn lead to clues regarding the underlying cause of certain types of neurocristopathies
like familial dysautonomia and neural crest-derived cancers like neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma.
Aim 1: RNA-sequencing of pure populations of post-migratory cranial neural crest cells: RNA-sequencing
of isolated condensing cranial neural crest cells will allow us to identify novel transcription factors and adhesion
molecules that may drive neural crest condensation into cranial ganglia.
Aim 2: Functional analysis of genes selectively upregulated upon condensation to form ganglia:
Identified upregulated genes in condensing cranial neural crest cells will be validated by in situ hybridization and
Hybridization Chain Reaction. We will then perform systematic loss-of-function and ectopic expression
experiments on selected genes to examine their role in regulating condensation into and differentiation of
peripheral ganglia.
Aim 3: Characterization of cis-regulatory elements modulating gene expression during ganglion
condensation: To identify putative enhancers driving gene expression during cranial neural crest condensation,
we will perform ATAC-sequencing to identify conserved noncoding regions in the genome that are accessible to
transcription factors during cranial neural crest condensation."
10861055,"Approximately 33-50% of intensive care unit (ICU) survivors develop long-term cognitive impairment – a well-established form of Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementia (ADRD). ICU-acquired ADRD prevalence is especially high in acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis survivors, affecting up to 80%. This loss of cognition leads to loss of independence, employment, and quality of life and persists for months to years. ICU-acquired ADRD is part of a broader syndrome known as Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS), including physical, mental, and socioeconomic impairments. ICU Recovery Clinics (ICU-RC) are a feasible and promising intervention to collaboratively address ICU-acquired ADRD and other PICS impairments, but in-person access is limited. There is a need to study efficacy of ICU-RCs with large cohorts using alternative delivery strategies to expand availability and reach. Older (age >=45) septic shock and/or acute respiratory failure patients are at a combined risk for ICU-acquired ADRD among other impairments, and the ideal population to first address this knowledge gap. The Vanderbilt ICU Recovery Center team has nearly 10 years of experience providing interdisciplinary, collaborative care to identify and treat ICU-acquired ADRD and other PICS impairments experienced by ICU survivors. We hypothesize that a collaborative telemedicine-delivered interdisciplinary ICU-RC intervention effectively identifies and improves long-term cognitive function, and as secondary outcomes, physical and mental health function, social integration, and self-management behaviors vs. a control condition with follow-up chosen by the discharge team. Therefore, in a sample of older septic shock and acute respiratory failure survivors, we aim to examine the efficacy of telemedicine ICU-RC services vs. control follow-up chosen by the discharge team in identifying and managing ICU-acquired ADRD and other PICS impairments (i.e., physical, mental health, social, self-management function) at 6 months after hospital discharge. We will address our hypothesis and aims by conducting a controlled trial of 202 patients randomized 1:1 with age stratification to telemedicine ICU-RC or control (101 per group). Telemedicine recipients will receive a minimum of 2 ICU-RC visits within 3 months of hospital discharge or return to home if discharged to another institution, with additional follow-up determined by the severity of PICS impairment. Our primary outcome is cognitive function (Aim 1) at 6 months using the MoCA-Blind and PROMIS Cognitive Function from the Long-term Core Outcome Measurement Set for ICU survivors. Our secondary outcomes are physical and mental health functioning (Aim 2) and social integration and self-management behaviors (Aim 3). In addition to 6-month measurements, we will assess pre-hospital function and 1-week post-discharge to assess discharge functional trajectories. This research will provide scientific justification for the continued development, implementation, and scaling of ICU recovery programs. Ultimately, such knowledge can improve the quality of life for millions of ICU survivors and family members by reducing ADRD burden."

Chronic walking impairments such as decreased walking speed, endurance, and independence are common
after stroke and limit physical activity, quality of life, and community involvement. These walking impairments
contribute to high healthcare costs and the development of secondary disabilities. Walking impairments tend to
persist despite gait rehabilitation, partly because we lack a comprehensive understanding of which brain
pathways contribute to lower limb and walking recovery after stroke. Emerging evidence suggests that
ipsilaterally-descending motor pathways from the non-lesioned hemisphere to the stroke-affected limb,
specifically the corticoreticulospinal tract, may be enhanced. However, the measurement tools used in prior work,
when considered in isolation, provide limited insight into whether this pathway is functional enhanced and
contributes to improved lower limb function. The primary objective of this proposal is to address this question
with the long-term goal of improving gait rehabilitation after stroke by identifying recovery-related motor pathways
that can be targeted. Our central hypothesis is that the corticoreticulospinal tract from the non-lesioned brain
hemisphere to the more affected limb will be enhanced after stroke. The secondary objective of this proposal is
to determine whether the strength of the corticoreticulospinal tract from the non-lesioned brain hemisphere
influences lower limb motor control. To achieve the objectives of this proposal, two specific aims will be tested
in individuals with chronic stroke with a range of impairment. In Aim 1, we will develop a multi-dimensional
estimate of whether the corticoreticulospinal tract is enhanced after stroke by combining three measures used
in prior research: functional magnetic resonance imaging (non-lesioned brain activation), diffusion tensor imaging
(structural integrity), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (functional excitability). In Aim 2, the association
between the strength of the corticoreticulospinal tract from the non-lesioned hemisphere and lower limb motor
control will be assessed. This analysis will account for measures of stroke severity (lesion load and lower limb
impairment). The proposed work would be the first to use a multifaceted approach to comprehensively and
rigorously assess whether brain pathways from the non-lesioned hemisphere to the stroke-affected lower limb
are enhanced after stroke. Results from this work will improve our understanding of the brain pathways that
contribute to walking recovery after stroke, essential information for improving walking rehabilitation. The
proposed work will also provide insight into how stroke impairment influences the mechanisms of recovery and
the optimal rehabilitative strategy. Support for the central hypothesis will be a major breakthrough that supports
the potential for neuromodulation applied to non-lesioned brain pathways pathways to lead to improvements in
walking recovery after stroke. Improvements in walking rehabilitation that result from the proposed work could
lead to substantial reductions in chronic walking impairment, disability, and societal cost of stroke."

The rising incidence of allergic disease is a public health challenge needing novel interventions. While mast
cell activation by IgE has a known role in disease pathology, fundamental aspects of mast cell biology remain
unclear. There is a particular need to understand sex-specific effects. Mast cells from female mice have
stronger IgE-induced responses, an observation complementing the greater incidence and acuity of allergic
asthma among women. In an effort to repurpose drugs, we found that fluoxetine (Prozac) potently suppresses
mast cell activation by IgE. These data were consistent in vitro, in vivo, and with human mast cells. However,
fluoxetine effects were strikingly female-restricted. Our results indicate fluoxetine has an off-target effect on
P2X3, an ATP-activated cationic channel most often associated with pain signaling. We find that mast cells
rapidly release ATP in response to IgE signaling, suggesting P2X3 is triggered in an autocrine loop. P2X3 was
readily detectable on female but not male mast cells and may explain why female mast cells have stronger IgE
responses. Like fluoxetine, P2X3-selective inhibitors greatly suppressed mast cell responses to IgE or ATP.
Inhibitors of other P2X proteins had no effect. Our study will test the hypothesis that IgE signaling elicits ATP
release that activates P2X3 selectively in females, amplifying allergic inflammation. This pathway could offer
an explanation and a clinical target for sexual dimorphism in allergic disease.
We have three Specific Aims:
Aim 1: We will test the hypothesis that P2X3 enhances mast cell function in females.
Aim 2: We will test the hypothesis that fluoxetine acts by suppressing P2X3 function and expression.
Aim 3: We will test the hypothesis that P2X3 is a fundamental part of allergic airway inflammation that can be
targeted in females."

Acute respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide.
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children, elderly and
immunocompromised patients, as well as of asthma exacerbations. No effective treatment or vaccine for RSV
is currently available, and many fundamental questions regarding the pathogenesis of RSV-induced lung
disease have yet to be answered. Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) have been found to regulate many
cellular processes, including host-virus interactions. RSV infection can significantly alter the expression profile
of host sncRNAs, and several types of sncRNAs, such as miRNA and tRFs, have been shown to play a
significant role in RSV replication and virus-induced host responses. In recent studies, we found that RSV
infection alters the expression of piwi RNAs, (piRNAs), one of the largest classes of sncRNA molecules
expressed in animal cells. Although the role of piRNAs was initially confined to gonad development, recent
studies have identified specific expression profile of piRNAs from multiple organs and cell types, and different
profiles have been associated with several diseases, including various types of cancers, cardiovascular
diseases, autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. Surprisingly, almost nothing is known regarding
piRNA generation/function and PIWI proteins in the context of viral infections. Identification of patterns and
details of human sncRNAs generation has significantly helped understanding how they modulate host
responses in the context of viral infections. The outcome of the proposed studies will lead to new knowledge
regarding the role of piRNAs in RSV-induced cellular responses, potentially identifying novel therapeutic
targets and/or bio-markers for disease diagnosis and prognosis."

 Chronic alcohol misuse is a major risk factor for alcohol-associated liver disease, a serious health
condition that represents approximately 50% of deaths in the U.S. related to chronic liver disease.
Known pathophysiological processes associated with alcohol-induced liver injury (ALI) include oxidative
stress, alteration of cell signaling, and inflammation; however, little is known about the effects of alcohol
on the hepatic epigenome, an emerging area with significant implications in the pathogenesis and
progression of ALI. Specifically, changes in histone acetylation, which includes the alcohol-induced
H3K9Ac chromatin mark, have been observed in several studies utilizing various cell culture and animal
models of acute and chronic alcohol exposure. A key feature of alcohol-induced histone acetylation
changes is that ethanol-derived metabolites can be incorporated directly into the hepatic
epigenome (i.e., acetate to Acetyl-CoA used for histone acetylation), which could have a significant
impact on transcriptional processes and subsequent pathophysiological outcomes related to chronic
alcohol use. Interestingly, ACSS2, a nucleocytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of acetate
to Acetyl-CoA, has recently been shown to play a role in regulation of lipid metabolism genes where
deletion of Acss2 protects against high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis. However, in the context of
alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis and associated histone acetylation changes, the role of ACSS2 is
essentially unknown. We propose a novel metabolic tracing approach using stable isotope (non-
radioactive)-labeled ethanol and high-resolution mass spectrometry to accurately quantify the
contribution of ethanol-derived Acetyl-CoA and ACSS2 to hepatic histone acetylation at site-specific
levels in a chronic plus binge alcohol exposure model. We hypothesize that ethanol metabolism as
well as ACSS2 activity will enhance alcohol-induced hepatic histone acetylation and that enrichment of
these histone acetylation sites occurs at gene/gene promoter regions associated with markers and/or
pathways relevant to alcohol-induced liver injury phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we will 1) quantify
the hepatocyte-specific contribution of Acetyl-CoA derived from ethanol metabolism and ACSS2 activity
to histone acetylation in a mouse model of chronic ethanol exposure and 2) determine the impact of
site-specific histone acetylation increases induced by ethanol metabolism and ACSS2 activity on ALI
phenotype. The results from this project could reveal a novel link between alcohol-induced changes in
hepatic histone acetylation and liver injury phenotype, ultimately providing a foundation to guide future
mechanistic studies related to the specific role of ACSS2 in the progression of severe liver injury
brought about by excessive alcohol misuse."

 Skeletal muscle tissue is essential for life, requiring continuous maintenance and repair by a resident
population of skeletal muscle stem cells or satellite cells (SCs). Maintenance and repair of skeletal muscle re-
quires fusion of SCs into existing myofibers or fusion of SCs with each other to replace a damaged myofiber, as
inhibiting SC fusion prevents hypertrophy of myofibers and elimination of SCs prevents skeletal muscle repair.
Inactive SCs are mitotically quiescent, residing between the myofiber plasma membrane and the basement
membrane, an inherently asymmetric environment. Following a muscle injury, quiescent SCs activate, exiting
quiescence and proliferate, eventually terminally differentiating with daughter cells fusing or re-acquiring qui-
escence and re-occupying their niche to replenish the SC population. Replenishment of SCs occurs via symmet-
ric or asymmetric division, likely balanced by the extent of muscle repair or maintenance. Understanding the
mechanisms regulating SC division will provide knowledge for development of therapeutics targeting SCs for
improving muscle repair to combat aging and muscle diseases. Single cell sequencing and single nuclear se-
quencing of skeletal muscle has revealed unexpected heterogeneity in skeletal muscle myonuclei as well as the
unexpected contribution of non-SC progenitors to myonuclei. Because skeletal muscle cells are syncytial, de-
rived from fusion of many hundreds of progenitors or SCs, lineage tracing the parental cells producing myonu-
clei has proven highly technically challenging, broadening a knowledge gap that does not exist in tissues popu-
lated by mononuclear cells. To fill this knowledge gap, we have developed a novel approach to lineage trace my-
onuclear parents that is a flexible, quantitative method that can be applied to SCs and non-myogenic myonu-
clear progenitors. Moreover, our method allows quantification of the cell divisions a myonucleus underwent
prior to terminal differentiation, which has not previously been attempted in most lineage tracing experiments.
We plan employ the methodology we have developed to aid in answering: (i) Are clonally diverse myonuclei
derived from distinct progenitors?, (ii) Are heterogeneous populations of SCs responsible for producing myo-
nuclei and SCs, respectively?, and, (iii) What environmental signals affect SC behavior during production of
centrally located myonuclei vs. production of peripheral nuclei? to fulfill broad knowledge gaps in understand-
ing how myonuclear diversity ensures that skeletal muscle is functional and healthy."

The hippocampus has been implicated in numerous functions related to normal memory and its dysfunction in
several diseases. Our lab has investigated the hippocampus in relation to schizophrenia (SZ) pathophysiology
using cognitive and behavioral outcomes(1-3) and brain image analyses(4-6). These consistently show that
hippocampal (Hipp) activity is elevated in schizophrenic psychosis (SZ), especially in early illness. To test the
molecular basis of this hyperactivity, we examined human postmortem hippocampal tissue by subfield,
contrasting healthy and schizophrenia cases, using excitatory and inhibitory synaptic markers and Golgi. We
found a reduction in GluN1 limited to dentate gyrus (DG) and an increase in markers of synaptic strength in CA3
in the SZ tissue; these changes are consistent with the observations that Lee et al(7) reported in hippocampal
cell cultures (see A.1). Lee showed that CA3 pyramidal cell sensitivity is inversely and powerfully controlled by
afferent input from DG, with decreased afferent input associated with increased pyramidal cell activity. We have
been able to recapitulate this human-specific SZ pathology in a mouse using a DG-selective GluN1 knock out
(KO)(8). This back-translation mouse KO demonstrated Hipp hyperactivity and alterations in Hipp-mediated
behaviors (8). We are piloting an inhibitory DREADD technique in DG to mimic the DG-selective GluN1 KO
mouse and saw evidence of a sensitive period during ‘adolescence’, when reduced DG activity could stimulate
hyperactivity in CA3/CA1. This time phase cannot be resolved in the KO animal, so we had not seen it before
and can only study it using DREADDs. The goal of these experiments are to causally define the mechanisms
underlying the neurobiological outcomes of temporary DG hypofunction in mouse using DREADD constructs,
and to show the extent, development, and critical periods of vulnerability of brain-wide changes. Having found
a discrete circuit of Hipp projection regions hyperactive in the KO mouse, we will test human SZ vs HC tissue in
these regions for evidence of hyperactivity and coherence with Hipp. The goal is to build a model of how
hippocampal hyperactivity affects behavior and brain pathology, and specifically how this tissue pathology could
support aberrant memories with psychotic content."

10896281,"The alarming emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogenic microorganisms worldwide and the lack of
next-generation portfolios of novel antimicrobials threaten human and public health. Therefore, it is a worldwide
priority to expedite the development of novel antimicrobial therapies to control MDR bacteria effectively. Natural
and synthetic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) exhibit great potential as therapeutic agents because of their unique
modes of action in fast-killing bacteria through membrane permeation. However, several barriers to AMP
development limit its clinical application. This application aims to overcome current AMP limitations to develop a
safe and effective broad-spectrum antimicrobial against MDR Gram-negative bacterial infection. Our novel
peptide therapeutics A4-AMP antibiotics (A4X) is a new generation of computationally engineered AMPs
(eAMPs) derived from the antimicrobial motif, alpha-4, of a natural human host defense protein SPLUNC1 with
negligible toxicity to mammalian cells. The extensive results from our studies demonstrate that our current lead
candidate displays superior antibacterial activity to standard of care (SoC) antibiotics in over 500 clinical isolates
of difficult-to-kill MDR Gram-negative pathogens obtained from hospitals and the CDC & FDA Antibiotic
Resistance Isolate Bank. Our A4X lead also has a much lower tendency to develop resistance than SoC
antibiotics. The A4X lead is safe and well tolerated when intravenously administered to mice and rats, with a four
times higher maximum tolerated dosage than colistin, a last resort antibiotic, in mouse blood circulation.
 Moreover, we have demonstrated the efficacy of the A4X lead against Klebsiella pneumoniae and
Acinetobacter baumannii in mouse models of bacteremia and respiratory infection. In this project, we will carry
out preclinical and pre-IND non-clinical development activities and perform structure-activity relationship (SAR)
based optimization of the current A4X lead to advance the preclinical development and to determine the clinical
utility. We will extensively examine the safety, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, and efficacy of these novel
antimicrobial agents in small and large animals of the most effective A4X. The targeting bacteria are the MDR
strains of Gram-negative species on the CDC's urgent pathogen threats list and WHO's the most critical global
priority 1 pathogens list (carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Escherichia
coli) and, including resistant strains to colistin. This proposal targets the urgent unmet global medical need for
novel antibiotics and addresses the U.S. National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria in a
timely manner. Successful completion of these studies will have an enormous impact on developing a novel
class of antibiotics capable of fighting MDR ""superbugs."""

Highly regenerative tissues such as blood and skin may utilize blood vessels as dual players in
tissue growth functions: one in supplying O2/nutrients and another in regulating tissue stem cell
activity via signaling. Correlative evidence suggest that skin endothelial cells may act as
signaling niches to adult hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs), regulating their quiescence. To
demonstrate this, we need gene targeting of signaling molecules in endothelial cells that in turn
would affect stem cell activity. Furthermore, recent work on skin vasculature probed a role of
lymphatic vessels but not of blood vessels in adult HFSC activation. Finally, the extent of skin
vasculature remodeling and its genetic control during the hair cycle are poorly understood. We
propose to use a combined genetic and genomic approach in mice to address all these
questions. Our mouse models provide an exciting entry point to address the cross-
communication of HFSCs with the neighboring endothelial cells, to probe its physiological
relevance, and to place endothelial cells for the first time as bona-fide signaling niches for adult
HFSCs. This work will have future broad relevance for human skin regeneration studies and for
more in depth understanding of skin vasculature disease."
10870037,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is lethal, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 10%. Radical
surgical resection is the only curative option; however, few pancreatic cancer patients have resectable disease
at diagnosis. For a subset of patients with borderline resectable tumors, neoadjuvant therapies can downstage
the disease and enable surgical resection. Protumor characteristics (i.e., hypoxia, high stromal density, high
tissue pressure, and a high number of immunosuppressive cells) reduce the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapies.
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is more effective than traditional radiation therapy for downstaging
PDAC, but not all tumors are responsive. Traditionally, tumor treatment response is evaluated using
anatomical tumor measurements, but this is limited because tumor size often does not correlate with tumor
response. To improve this situation, we will establish a fundamentally new tool to image PDAC tumors to
augment the available diagnostic imaging. We will advance shear modulus (SM) and vascular perfusion (VP)
as surrogate imaging biomarkers for assessing tumor response to neoadjuvant therapies. In a uniquely
beneficial approach for a difficult tumor to characterize, this project will combine pre-surgical, intra-surgical,
and post-resection imaging with in vivo perfusion assessment and ex vivo pathology. Our extensive pre-clinical
results demonstrate that SM and VP are sensitive to changes in protumor characteristics. Therefore, we
hypothesize that SM and VP changes are direct diagnostics of the tumor microenvironment and can be used to
assess therapeutic efficacy and response. To test this, we will combine shear wave elastography (SWE) with
optical fluorescence tomography (OFT) of indocyanine green optical tissue perfusion tracer to evaluate the
interplay between SM and Gemcitabine perfusion for different therapies, providing more comprehensive
information regarding tumor response. We will develop a new hybrid imaging tool to systematically assess how
SM and VP vary during neoadjuvant therapies through two specific aims: In Aim 1, we will perform pre-clinical
studies with three progressive PDAC murine models that have different features that recapitulate human
disease to evaluate how SM and VP relate to (a) stromal density, (b) the number of immunosupportive cells,
and (c) the degree of hypoxia during SBRT, chemotherapy, and chemoradiation therapy. In Aim 2, we will
clinically translate this work. We will compare our interventional SWE and OFT imaging to magnetic resonance
elastography (MRE) and dynamic-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to assess tumor
microenvironmental changes during SBRT, chemotherapy, and chemoradiation therapy. We will also perform
SWE on excised PDAC to evaluate how SM and VP relates to tumor microenvironment changes. These new
imaging features are potential surrogate biomarkers, enabling clinicians to recognize whether treatment
succeeds or fails. This practice-changing information will allow for the optimization of neoadjuvant treatment
protocols on an individualized patient basis, resulting in more curative surgical candidates."

Poor diet and excess weight during adolescence predicts excess weight and diet-related cancers during
adulthood, yet there is little research on the risk factors that contribute to weight gain among adolescents. The
National Academy of Medicine identifies exposure to food advertisements (ads) as a major predictor of poor diet
among children (<12 years of age) because studies have shown that children who are exposed to food ads
consume more calories than children who are exposed to non-food ads. The few food ad studies that have
included adolescents (13–17 years of age) found associations between self-reported exposure to television (TV)
food ads and poor diet, but we do not know which mechanisms explain this relationship. It is also well established
that food companies promote their least healthy products to Black consumers more than White consumers and
perceive Black youth as trendsetters. But it is not known whether seeing racially congruent ads (i.e., the person
in the ad and the viewer are the same race) places Black adolescents at higher risk of poor diet relative to Whites.
Finally, most food ad research is based on TV ads, but food companies are increasingly targeting adolescents
on social media. And no social media food ad studies have focused on racially targeted ads. Addressing these
gaps is important because adolescence is a critical period for adopting nutritious eating habits that can prevent
future diet-related cancers. The overall objective of our three studies is to identify the extent to which exposure to
Facebook food ads increases the number of calories purchased and consumed by Black and White adolescents.
Guided by strong preliminary data, we will test three aims: 1) To evaluate the extent to which exposure to racially
congruent vs. incongruent Facebook food ads causes Black vs. White adolescents to purchase more calories for a
snack; 2) To determine the extent to which exposure to many vs. few “likes” on Facebook food ads causes Black and
White adolescents to purchase more calories for a snack; and 3) To test the degree to which visual attention to
unhealthy foods, racially congruent people, and/or “likes” in Facebook ads explains the relationship between ad
exposure and calorie intake. To address the first and second aims, we will conduct two randomized online
experiments. Under the third aim, we will conduct a within-subjects lab study using eye-tracking technology. We
hypothesize that exposure to racially congruent Facebook food ads will increase the number of calories
purchased and consumed by adolescents. We also predict that Black adolescents who attend to Black people
in food ads will consume more calories than those who attend to other ad features. This innovative work will
examine actual purchases and caloric intake; use novel tools (e.g., Facebook “reaction” buttons) to examine ad
preferences; and use a state-of-the-art eye-tracking computer with discreet cameras. The proposed research
will increase our mechanistic knowledge of communication tools that influence adolescents' dietary behaviors and
could inform cancer prevention interventions that aim to improve adolescents' diets using effective ad techniques."
10836543,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human physiology depends on precise cellular responses to environmental signals. Specificity in responding
to environmental signals is achieved through specific proteomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and non-genetic
cell states. In physiological states, healthy cells function in harmony with their surrounding tissues, performing
specific functions in response to environmental stimuli. In disease, dysregulation of cell state can prevent
cells from producing necessary responses and lead to proliferation independent of physiological context.
Understanding how cell state drives cell function is essential for understanding tissue function in health and
disease, and is required for engineering cell therapies capable of specific behaviors encoded by their target
environments. Despite decades of research into single cell biology, we still don't understand the fundamental
principles that connect cell state with specificity in cellular responses to their environment
 In my proposed research, I will use synthetic biology tools to quantitatively probe the connection
between cell state and signaling specificity. My proposed work will provide insight into how cells of
different types achieve unique responses to their environments and will generate computational models that
can be used to engineer cellular behavior. To investigate how cells of different types uniquely respond to the
same signal, I will use optogenetics to perturb the model signal cAMP in candidate cell types of the early
mouse embryo and in an unbiased screen in developing zebrafish. My studies in mouse embryonic stem cells
will serve as a proof of principle for controlling cell type through intracellular signaling and for rewiring cellular
responses with genetic expression programs. My work in zebrafish will result in a predictive model that can
be used to infer a given cell's unique response to a stimulus using only transcriptional data from that cell.
Throughout this work, I will focus on generating interpretable computational models that can be used in the
future to engineer cellular behavior.
 I will achieve the above work through synthesizing my previous training in neuroscience, cell signaling,
and applied synthetic biology with proposed training in developmental biology, genomics, quantitative
modeling of cellular processes, and cellular engineering. I will also supplement my previous training and
experience in teaching and mentorship with new training in advocacy to best position myself to mentor my
future trainees and further justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout the scientific enterprise. Through
my proposed research and training, I will be well positioned to transition to an independent position where I
can achieve my scientific and advocacy goals."

 The U.S. will not meet the targets of the Ending the HIV Epidemic Plan (EHE) without an intentional
focus on improving outcomes among Black sexual minority men living with HIV (BSMM LWH). Only 55% of
BSMM LWH maintain 100% daily treatment adherence and only 62% are virally suppressed. Research proves
that multilevel factors such as racism, stigma, depression, victimization, and economic instability are important
unaddressed determinants of HIV care outcomes. Updates to health care delivery models due to COVID-19
(i.e. telehealth) provided novel ways to improve HIV care engagement, retention, and adherence. However,
BSMM still experience worse outcomes than others even when accounting for differences in access to
resources. The literature collectively suggests that multilevel factors could create distinct socioecological
patterns that impact HIV care outcomes for BSMM LWH, especially across age groups. BSMM LWH have not
adequately engaged or retained in care activities because previous approaches do not account for their current
or combined socioecological experiences. Previous studies are outdated, cross-sectional, utilize culturally
inappropriate measures, and have small samples of Black participants. Sustainable approaches to engage this
population remain elusive, especially for young BSMM LWH. There is no digital, limited interaction cohort study
centered on BSMM LWH despite focus given to other priority populations such as transwomen, drug users,
and adolescents. The goal of this Limited Interaction Targeted Epidemiology proposal is to conduct a
prospective cohort study to identify the HIV care riskscape for BSMM LWH and examine how multilevel factors
impact changes in retention in HIV care, treatment adherence, and viral suppression. Phase 1 will identify
effective recruitment strategies (Aim 1) and validate commonly accepted scales among BSMM LWH to aid in
survey design (Aim 2). Then we will explore the feasibility and acceptability of enrolling a large digital cohort of
Mid-Atlantic BSMM LWH (Aim 3). Phase 2 will collect and analyze prospective cohort data collected at
baseline, 3-months, 6-months to quantify the cross sectional and longitudinal relationships between multilevel
factors and HIV care outcomes among 1,500 BSMM LWH (Aim 4). This study will be the largest prospective
cohort focused on BSMM LWH ever conducted and targets high-priority EHE locales. This study aligns with
NIH priorities to map longitudinal trajectories of the HIV care continuum, identify predictors of changes in viral
suppression, and support large studies led by Black investigators. This work also builds upon the existing
collaboration, resources, and support of the Mid Atlantic CFAR Consortium and is the next step needed in our
work to design equitable approaches to improve HIV care outcomes for BSMM LWH."

Gene regulation – how genes are turned on in the right place, at the right time and in the right amount – is a
problem central to most areas of biology and medicine. Our understanding of gene regulation arose from
classical studies in bacteria: proteins called “transcription factors” (TFs) bind to regulatory DNA sequences and
recruit RNA polymerase (RNAP). The situation in eukaryotes is far more complicated. For example, eukaryotic
DNA is packaged around nucleosomes into chromatin and external sources of energy, such as ATP, are used
to reorganise chromatin, remodel nucleosomes and post-translationally modify regulatory proteins. Pioneering
studies from several laboratories have identified many of the molecular components involved in this regulatory
complexity. However, the quantitative concepts used to reason about eukaryotic gene regulation are still
largely based on the bacterial paradigm. Our work focuses on addressing this alarming gap. Previously, we
developed a strategy of “following the energy” by integrating mathematical models rooted in physics with
quantitative and synthetic experiments in the early Drosophila embryo. The fruit fly offers an unrivaled model
system for measuring and perturbing gene regulation in a living organism. The mathematics exploits a graph-
based approach to Markov processes that permits algebraic calculation of required quantities. This allowed us
to identify the functional limits to energy expenditure, while avoiding fitting models to data or numerically
simulating differential equations. We have provided strong evidence that energy expenditure away from
thermodynamic equilibrium is essential for the functional properties of eukaryotic genes. In the present
proposal, we build on this previous strategy. We hypothesize that data from the Drosophila hunchback gene
cannot be accounted for by any thermodynamic equilibrium model of regulated recruitment of RNAP, no matter
how complicated the molecular details. We believe we can exploit a method of “coarse graining” within the
linear framework to establish this remarkably powerful result. We will then extend our experimental methods
and modeling beyond regulated recruitment, to analyze the dynamics of RNAP itself and the stochastic
production of mRNA. We will introduce real-time imaging of mRNA and optogenetic perturbations of TFs to
measure quantitative aspects of gene expression, and will extend our algebraic methods to accommodate
such data. We hypothesize that energy expenditure in gene regulation is essential to modulate RNAP
dynamics and generate the observed stochastic patterns of hunchback mRNA expression. Our efforts will
formulate a new model of hunchback that integrates regulation, energy expenditure, RNAP dynamics and
mRNA stochasticity."
10922680,"Reprogramming of conventional mitochondrial function is a key component of carcinogenesis and prostate
cancer aggressiveness. We hypothesize that key discriminatory mechanisms in early-onset and lethal
prostate cancer occur through environmental exposures in early development and in young adult life which
reprogram mitochondrial function, causing or enabling early-onset and fatal prostate cancer.
Rationale and Innovation. While mechanisms cannot be proven by retrospective analyses, our access to
repository samples collected in young men (median age 34) years before prostate cancer onset, and also
peri-conceptual paternal and maternal pregnancy repository samples for men who later developed early-
onset prostate cancer, enable us to apply powerful analytical capabilities to link predictive metabolic signatures
of outcome with concurrent prospective measures of exposures. This creates an unprecedented
opportunity to test the central hypothesis that endocrine-disrupting exposures in early development
and young adulthood are associated with metabolic signatures of mitochondrial reprogramming and
subsequent early-onset (< age 60) and lethal prostate cancer. If correct, findings will provide a foundation
for prevention strategies to augment protective pathways and block risk pathways.
Design. The study population is a 60 y two-generation follow-up of the Child Health and Development Studies

American population. This design allows us to address disparities in risk. Aim 1 is a Metabolome-Wide
Association Study (MWAS) to test the hypothesis that mitochondria-associated metabolic signatures in pre-
diagnostic serum of young adult men predict subsequent lethal prostate cancer in African American and non-
African Americans in the CHDS father’s generation. Aim 2 is an Exposome-Wide Association Study (ExWAS)
to test the hypothesis that pre-diagnostic serum of young adult men contain endocrine-disrupting chemicals
associated with lethal prostate cancer in African Americans and non-African Americans in the CHDS father’s
generation. Aim 3 uses paternal peri-conceptual serum and maternal pregnancy serum to test for metabolic
signatures and environmental exposures that predict early-onset prostate cancer in CHDS sons’ generation.
This research will have sustained impact by showing, in a race-specific manner, whether mitochondrial
metabolic pathways vary with early-onset and lethal prostate cancer risk decades before cancer onset,
whether these changes associate with concurrent environmental exposures, and whether multi-generational
associations occur between metabolic or environmental exposures and early-onset prostate cancer. The study
has the potential to distinguish the time in the life-course when prevention is most effective. Results will help
define men who will benefit from intense screening and accelerate prevention with critical relevance to
African Americans who have unacceptably high risk of early-onset and lethal prostate cancer."
10892107,"Project Summary/Abstract
Despite investment by the National Institutes of Health in training underrepresented minority (URM) biomedical
researchers, diversity at the independent investigator and academic leadership ranks (e.g., Associate and Full
Professors, Division Chiefs and Department Chairs) in academic medical institutions remains meager. In 2019,
among all 179,238 full-time faculty at medical degree-granting institutions, only 9.5% were URMs. The attrition
of intellectual capital from the academy painstakingly earned by URM mid-career faculty at the cusp of becoming
independent researchers and/or taking on leadership roles is disheartening. Despite the promising outcomes of
career development programs (CDP) in facilitating early career success, few CPDs intentionally support the
needs of URM mid-career faculty by bolstering their leadership skills and mentoring them to strengthen their
psychological safety and self-efficacy, both of which are critical for professional advancement. Our overall
objective is to transform the diversity of the biomedical research workforce by establishing a national CDP that
enhances retention, promotion, and attainment of institutional leadership roles, thereby promoting longevity of
academic research careers of URM mid-career faculty. Our proposed TRANSFORM program unites the
expertise and educational modalities of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the University
of Pittsburgh's Institute for Clinical Research Education, in partnership with three minority serving institutions and
Centers of Excellence to recruit mid-career faculty researchers at the cusp of promotion and deserving of
consideration for institutional leadership positions. By leveraging the AAMC’s annual Mid-Career Minority Faculty
Leadership Seminar as the entry point to our program, we will matriculate 20 scholars per year into a yearlong
multi-faceted program for URM mid-career faculty. Our program aims to 1) promote career satisfaction and
retention in research careers by strengthening psychological safety and self-efficacy through small group
coaching and peer mentoring, 2) increase academic promotion and leadership attainment by providing culturally
responsive leadership skills training, 3) accelerate research career trajectories for URM scholars by providing
individualized mentoring and interactive customized career development plans, and 4) build structured
opportunities to facilitate institutional change, by having URM scholars complete a collaborative leadership
project with an institutional leader (e.g. Division Chief, Dept Chair). Developed with the diversity of partnerships
necessary to ensure long-term sustainability, our innovative program will increase retention of mid-career faculty
and their promotion to senior ranks and leadership roles. Bolstering the ranks of senior URM researchers will, in
turn, aid in the recruitment and mentorship of future URM investigators, build equitable and inclusive institutional
cultures and ultimately be transformative in diversifying the biomedical research workforce to ensure equity in
health and healthcare for all."

of careers as physician scientists. Based on a recently completed strategic planning process, we have devised
a new leadership structure, recruited new world class research faculty, kept successful educational and
training elements, while incorporating innovative new offerings -- all galvanized to address one of the greatest
challenges facing modern medicine and public health: the global antibiotic resistance crisis. Our renewal
proposal for Postdoctoral ID Training at UCSD, which we retitle “CARING: Combating Antibiotic Resistance
into the Next Generation” leverages the institutional investment and educational resources of a major campus-
wide initiative – the Collaborative to Halt Antibiotic-Resistant Microbes (CHARM). We retain core elements of
our training structure that have yielded excellent trainee outcomes, including recruitment and selection
processes that enlisted trainee cohorts with significant diversity from URM groups, unique T32 Fellow
educational curricula (e.g. the CREST program) and our Mentors-in-Development (MiD) program for junior
faculty. The fundamental change to our program is the AMR focus of research training, organized in 6 themes:
1) Deciphering Microbial Virulence; (2) Host Defense & Vaccinology, (3) Novel Therapeutic Discovery, (4)
Microbiome Science, (5) Systems Biology & Engineering, and (6) Clinical Microbiology & Therapeutics. We
have selected a world-class faculty the top 29 leading investigators with proven mentorship skills to comprise
our new Research Training faculty (12 continuing + 17 new). Instead of 6 MD fellow slots, we will recruit
talented Adult and Pediatric ID fellows across 5 MD slots + 2 PhD postdoctoral scientist slots to encourage
interdisciplinary synergies between clinical and basic scientists. Dr. Victor Nizet, an eminent UCSD ID
Physician-Scientist (>450 papers) with a superlative track record in postdoctoral fellow mentorship (>20

10892991,"ABSTRACT
Significance: Exposure to narrow band green light (nbGL) appears to reduce intensity, frequency, and duration
of migraine headache and some of its most bothersome symptoms and does so more effectively than exposure to
dark. Because many migraine characteristics are attributed to abnormal cortical hyperexcitability and responsivity,
we are seeking to determine whether nbGL attenuates cortical activity, and if so to what extent, what extent it differs
from dark (known to help migraine headache). Given that pain and emotional changes are major components of
migraine, we will assess cortical activity including functional connectivity in a translational study design. A rodent
model will be used to evaluate aspects of cortical excitability and responsivity not possible in humans. If successful
in unraveling a cortical mechanism by which nbGL works, this study can help validate the use of this noninvasive,
risk-free and affordable therapeutic approach as an alternative/additional method for the treatment of migraine.
Preliminary data: Our clinical research team has extensive experience in functional near infrared spectroscopy
(fNIRS) imaging, technical development and use in the clinical setup; and our pre-clinical research team has
extensive experience in direct cortical recording in animal models of migraine and aura. Approach: Using fNIRS
imaging in migraine patients and healthy subjects, and electrocorticography (ECoG) recording in naïve and diseased
state rats, we propose to (1) define a mechanistic basis for nbGL effects on sensory and affective cortical functions
during and in between migraine attacks; (2) show signal specificity of pain/nociceptive/affective responses during
exposure to nbGL, no light (NL), and white light (WL); and (3) record nbGL effects on key characteristics of cortical
spreading depression - one of the better-understood migraine-associated abnormal cortical event. Specific Aims:
In Aims 1-3, we will determine effects of nbGL (compared to WL and NL) on fNIRS measured in cortices of healthy
controls (aim 1A), interictal (Aim 2A) and ictal (Aim 3A) migraineurs, and ECoG recording in naïve (Aim 1B) and
disease-state (Aims 2B, 3B) rats. Hypotheses: Our hypotheses are: (a) in healthy subjects and naïve rats we will
observe significant differences in fNIRS cortical signals and ECoG measured at baseline and responsivity to sensory
stimuli under each of the 3 light conditions; (b) because the interictal state reflects a condition of relative cortical
hyperexcitability, fNIRS measures to resting state and evoked pain will show smaller excitation of cortical regions
(S1, mPFC) under nbGL than under WL, and ECoG measures will show stronger cortical activity power at WL and
NL than at nbGL; (c) even in the ictal state, which reflects the highest level of cortical excitability in the 3 study
groups, nbGL will have a greater effect on inhibiting cortical responsivity as measured by fNIRS and ECoG; and (d)
duration of exposure will enhance inhibitory nbGL effect on cortical excitability and responsivity, far beyond brief
exposure. Team: The technical, clinical and basic science members have worked together for many years and have
the necessary background to successfully complete the proposed human and rat studies."
10877189,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tissue loss in the thalamus is one of the earliest imaging hallmarks of multiple sclerosis. However, the current
inability to study tissue alterations non-invasively on the cellular and molecular level in the different sub-regions
of the deep gray matter, which fulfill distinct functional roles, represents a critical barrier for understanding and
targeting biological mechanisms that may precede or interact with neurodegeneration. Magnetic resonance
imaging of magnetic tissue susceptibility represents a unique window through which tissue iron can be
assessed clinically. Iron is an essential co-factor in various biochemical pathways. Its deprivation from glial
cells in the normal-appearing white matter is a pathological hallmark of multiple sclerosis that has been
implicated in neuronal injury. It was recently observed that the thalamus of patients with multiple sclerosis
shows a progressive decline in magnetic susceptibility. Other research suggests that a similar phenomenon
may exist in other deep gray matter regions. A critical need exists to confirm and validate this observation be-
cause deep gray matter injury is strongly linked to the progression of disability. The overall objective of the
proposed research is to determine whether disease progression is linked to iron-related oligodendroglia
dysfunction in the deep gray matter. The central hypothesis is that declining oligodendroglial iron availability, as
manifested on magnetic resonance imaging, is an independent biological correlate of disease progression that
occurs throughout the brain. The rationale for the proposed research is that a link between iron loss over time
and disease progression will cause a paradigmatic shift in our understanding of the role of iron for neurodegen-
eration away from the toxicity of excess iron toward an insufficient availability of iron for critical biochemical
pathways. The project will pursue the following specific aims to achieve the objective: 1) Determine the associ-
ation between disease progression and magnetic resonance imaging markers of brain iron homeostasis. 2)
Identify the cellular and molecular substrate of magnetic resonance imaging markers of brain iron. Upon com-
pletion of these aims, the expected outcome is to have determined that oligodendroglia iron is reduced in the
chronic disease phase and that the progression to this state is linked to a worsening in disability. In particular,
the research is expected to have determined a generalizable model of the evolution of imaging markers over
time in patients relative to controls; cellular and molecular underpinnings of the imaging markers; and how im-
aging markers of iron are linked to neurodegeneration and injury in the white matter. These contributions are
expected to be significant because the evidence of a link between clinical disability and loss of oligodendroglial
iron in the gray matter as well as the availability of an imaging marker to assess this phenomenon will advance
the field vertically and support the development of new therapeutic strategies. The proposed research is inno-
vative because the new hypothesis of iron loss, the focus on deep gray matter sub-regions, and a unique mod-
eling approach for changes in iron concentration represent substantive departures from the status quo."

10929303,"The silent development and progression of neurologic morbidity, or neuromorbidity, among hospitalized,
critically ill patients represents a newly recognized and emerging epidemic. This includes patients admitted to
intensive care units with primary neurologic diagnoses, those at increased risk based on their underlying
disease (e.g. neurotropic viral infections including COVID19), and those where the development of
neuromorbidity is occult and unexpected. Neuromorbidity associated with critical illness can be caused by
physiologic instability, biochemical derangements, side effects of medications, invasive mechanical support,
immobility, and/or other therapies used to prevent death. It spans the age spectrum from neonates to the
elderly, occurs across gender and race, and is underrecognized in patients with systemic illnesses (e.g. sepsis,
viral infections, and other inflammatory conditions) and critical organ failure (e.g. acute respiratory distress
syndrome, cancer, hepatic and renal failure). In the U.S. the incidence of neuromorbidity ranges from 5-47% in
critically ill children and adults, thus impacting hundreds of thousands of patients annually. Often
neuromorbidity evolves undetected until after clinical manifestations emerge and is irreversible. Neuromorbidity
can strike acutely, e.g. seizures, stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral edema, and/or delirium, or in a
more protracted fashion, e.g. neuromuscular weakness and/or cognitive decline, and is often permanent,
endured throughout the remainder of a person’s lifetime. No standard clinical tool exists to identify patients at
risk for neuromorbidity or for real-time neurologic monitoring, in stark contrast to the heart, kidney, liver, and
many other organs.
 To fill this gap and transform the way clinicians detect and monitor for evolving brain injury, we developed
a Bio-digital Rapid Alert to Identify Neuromorbidity (BRAIN) that continuously feeds electronic health record
(EHR) variables in 9 clinical domains (A through I) into proprietary informatics and machine learning platforms.
Prototype BRAIN A-I models are robust and predict clinician concern for neuromorbidity before clinical action is
taken. To link biological and digital signatures, we have defined a panel of serum biomarkers that can identify
time-documented neuromorbidity before clinical detection. Using a “Bayesian to Bedside” approach, we have
created a live data pipeline bridging the EHR and a dedicated host server, establishing the infrastructure
necessary to operationalize BRAIN A-I as an embedded predictive analytic and decision-driving support tool.
 In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that digital signatures in the EHR coupled with brain-specific
biomarkers can rapidly detect neuromorbidity in critically ill children. Successful deployment of interoperable,
24/7 point-of-care neurologic monitoring for early detection of neuromorbidity would represent a breakthrough
for the clinical management of critically ill patients."
10909039,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Despite advancements in automated insulin delivery systems that demonstrate superior glycemic
outcomes, challenging clinical issues remain with the continued need for accurate carbohydrate
counting and meal announcement combined with slow-acting subcutaneous insulin that
contribute to repeated occurrences of postprandial hyperglycemia. This clinical gap in glycemic
control is addressed by the proposed project. We intend to leverage our existing advancements
in pattern recognition and anticipation to refine and test a fully automated closed-loop system that
does not require meal announcements. This system is unique in that it relies on pattern
recognition, particularly surrounding meals, in an anticipatory manner so that insulin action is
taken in advance of an expected meal rather than the predominantly reactive solutions that are
often proposed. We intend to further test and tune this system within the context of accelerated
insulins to further improve glycemic outcomes and remove barriers to use of these systems by
lowering burden of disease management.
We have already developed the foundational tools needed for a fully automated closed-loop and
will plan for further refinement by leveraging data from our accumulated clinical studies database.
We plan to conduct 2 pilots studies followed by a larger, 7-month main study to evaluate the
following specific aims of this proposal:
1) We hypothesize that novel faster acting insulin analogs can be safely used to provide more
effective fully automated closed-loop control. Our first pilot will test the differences between Fiasp
and a novel formulation of aspart (AT247) in a supervised trial. This trial results will inform the
selection of the insulin used in the subsequent trials.
2) We hypothesize that, with a design adapted to these new insulin formulations, fully automated
closed-loop control is a valid clinical alternative to hybrid closed-loop systems, the current state-
of-the-art systems.
3) Lastly, we hypothesize that further adding glycemic disturbance anticipation (e.g. generally
surrounding meals) to this fully automated closed-loop control system will further improve
glycemic outcomes compared with a fully automated closed-loop system without disturbance
anticipation."

Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Massey Cancer Center (MCC) will serve as the primary component
site for an NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site (MU-NCORP) UG1 award in partnership with 6
collaborating community affiliate sites in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Over 30% of patients seen in the MCC
MU-NCORP are from minority populations, primarily African Americans. This proposal emphasizes the unique
urban and rural population available to the MCC MU-NCORP, the history of extensive participation by primary
health care providers and specialists, in particular, surgeons, pediatric/AYA oncologists, gynecologic surgeons,
radiation oncologists, neuro-oncologists, and medical oncologists in clinical research, and VCU initiatives in
cancer outreach conducted at rural sites across Virginia. This community-based NCORP, focused on
participation in clinical research of minority populations, was initially funded as a Minority-Based Community
Clinical Oncology Program in 1990 and has been continuously funded, including since 2014 as a MU-NCORP.
The MCC MU-NCORP has affiliations with 5 Research Bases (Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology,
Children’s Oncology Group, ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, NRG Oncology, and the Wake Forest
NCORP Research Base). Our application describes the working relationships with the Research Bases and
the focus of the MCC MU-NCORP to accrue significant numbers of minority participants in cancer control and
prevention, treatment/imaging, and cancer care delivery clinical research studies. Working relationships of the
primary site’s investigators, research staff, and support personnel with the affiliate sites are also described.
Accordingly, the specific aims of this proposal are (1) to increase the overall enrollment of racial/ethnic and
rural populations in our catchment areas to NCI-approved studies, with a greater focus on cancer control
research, cancer prevention research, and cancer care delivery research (CCDR), in addition to cancer
treatment research; (2) to collaborate with the NCORP Research Bases by (i) providing insight into relevance
for community practices during concept development, (ii) identifying care disparities our catchment areas that
should be studied, and (iii) providing input on feasibility during concept and protocol development; (3) to
exceed the required annual minimum participation in CCDR protocols; (4) to participate in biospecimen
collection for biobanks that serve as scientific resources for NCORP Research Bases; and (5) to participate in
NCORP initiatives, such as DCP-001, to document screening efforts for clinical trial enrollment and to address
cancer health disparities.
The proposed research is relevant to the mission of the NCI as MCC and the community affiliates will bring
cancer clinical trials and research to low-income, minority, and medically underserved individuals who
otherwise would not have access to such studies. Targeting the minority/underserved populations in their
communities is a critical step toward alleviating the cancer care disparities prevalent in these populations."
10890141,"The prevalence of smoking is 15.5% in the general population, but exceeds 30% among those with low income
and low education. These smokers are less likely to proactively seek smoking cessation counseling, and less
likely to have ever used evidenced-based treatment (EBTs, counseling and medications) for quitting smoking.
Therefore, it is important to proactively reach smokers. Research supports the effectiveness of smoking
cessation counseling in dental settings. However, barriers to consistent implementation include provider lack of
time, training, and experience counseling smokers who are unmotivated to quit. Using technology could
provide a cost-effective and time-efficient way of delivering evidenced-based smoking cessation in dental
settings with a high degree of treatment fidelity. Because effective cessation programs already exist,
innovations are needed to drive smokers to engage with EBTs. Our pilot study developed and tested a video-
based smoking cessation induction intervention delivered through a Virtual Reality (VR) headset, while patients
were undergoing teeth cleaning. Patients in an urban dental clinic (n=23) wore the VR headset to watch a 10-
minute smoking cessation induction video during their teeth cleaning (not filmed in VR due to potential
interference with clinical care). We demonstrated patient satisfaction, feasibility, impact on mediators, and no
interference with clinical care. One month later, 5/23 patients reported smoking cessation, and 14/23 reported
quit attempts. The primary aim of the UH3 Stage 3 randomized efficacy trial is to test whether the above
intervention increases utilization of EBTs (Quitline, Clinic-based programs, NCI text message program, NRT or
other smoking cessation medication) within 7-months post-appointment. Participants (n=376) will be smokers
scheduled for a teeth cleaning at an urban dental clinic predominately serving underserved patients.
Participants will be randomized to either the VR intervention, which consists of: 1) the video-based intervention
via VR headset during their teeth cleaning, 2) brochure about EBTs, and 3) one month of text messages to
motivate engagement with EBTs; or Control group, which consists of watching a control video on relaxation
techniques through the VR headset (to maintain provider masking) during the teeth cleaning and receipt of the
same EBT brochure as the VR group. Both groups will receive weekly text message assessments for one
month after the dental appointment to assess mediators. We will objectively measure utilization of the Quitline,
the text message programs, and clinic based programs. Secondary outcomes are treatment effects on quit
attempts, biochemically verified abstinence, and motivation to quit. We will also assess moderators.
Assessments will occur at baseline, weekly for one month after the appointment (via text), one month post-
appointment, and 3 and 6 months later. Prior to UH3, the UG3 phase will involve finalization of the
intervention, a usability study, provider interviews, creation of a seamless transition between the study
intervention and EBTs, finalization of measures, impact on mediators, and satisfaction/acceptability data."

10904816,"CANCER GENETICS AND GENOMICS PRORGRAM – PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Cancer Genetics and Genomics (CGG) Program seeks to better understand the cancer genome and
leverage novel insights into cancer genomics to improve outcomes for cancer patients. The three main research
themes of the CGG Program include: (1) invention of cancer genome and transcriptome profiling technology; (2)
development of computational tools and resources for interpreting cancer genomes and transcriptomes; and (3)
implementation of high-throughput genetic-screening technologies to comprehensively map cancer
dependencies. The program is co-led by Adam Siepel and Christopher Vakoc, and includes 15 members.
During the last five years, CGG Program members have produced new technologies for analyzing structural
changes to the genome and defining their impact for patient prognosis, including an emerging focus on
aneuploidy. In addition, multiple technologies have been developed for the ultra-sensitive detection of rare
cancer cells in human tissues, which have transformative potential for early detection and to guide the timing of
aggressive chemotherapy treatment. With its expanding focus on computational approaches, the CGG Program
is revealing novel attributes of cancer genomes and transcriptomes at single-cell resolution. This rich genomic
information fuels the high-throughput screening efforts carried out by several Program members, which is
revealing new targets for therapeutic intervention. A key philosophy of the CGG Program is to integrate wet-
bench scientists, computational biologists, and oncologists at all stages of the technology-development process,
which allows for a seamless evolution from concept to clinic. CGG scientists are working closely with oncologists
at Northwell Health to design clinical studies that are evaluating the diagnostic potential of the technologies they
are developing. The success of CGG Program initiatives is represented by the 198 papers (188 publications and
10 preprints) from Program members. Among them, 41 (21%) resulted from intra-programmatic collaborations,
46 (23%) resulted from inter-programmatic collaborations, 149 (75%) involved collaborations with investigators
at other institutions, and 87 (44%) were published in journals with an impact factor greater than 10. Among the
15 Program members, 13 (87%) co-authored at least one article with another member of the Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory (CSHL) Cancer Center. Peer-reviewed funding in the Program increased from $2.3 million in 2015 to
$3.2 million in 2020. Program members are supported by 12 R01-equivalent grants among 6 members.
Collectively, the CGG Program represents the latest innovations in genome technology and computation, and
continues to drive discovery research within the CSHL Cancer Center."
10904819,"GENE REGULATION AND INHERITANCE PROGRAM – PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Gene Regulation and Inheritance (GRI) Program focuses on determining basic mechanisms governing
the regulation of gene expression and cellular inheritance at the molecular level, and on discovering how these
mechanisms are perturbed to influence the initiation and/or progression of cancer. GRI Program members share
an interest in uncovering the mechanisms governing transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation and
DNA replication, and in understanding how gene networks and cellular plasticity are rewired in cancer cells.
While basic fundamental research continues as a major focus of the Program, a number of studies naturally
transitioned in a preclinical or clinical direction, in part stimulated by the strong strategic alliance with Northwell
Health, making patient samples and clinical discussions more accessible. The GRI Program has three main
research themes: (1) elucidating essential mechanisms governing the regulation of non-coding RNAs,
transcription, splicing, and genome inheritance; (2) determining how transcriptional and post-transcriptional
control are dysregulated in cancer; and (3) developing therapeutic agents and biological systems to target
transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators. The Program is co-led by Leemor Joshua-Tor and David

44 (36%) were published in journals with an impact factor greater than ten. Among the 14 Program members,
12 (86%) co-authored at least one article with another member of the CSHL Cancer Center. Peer-reviewed
funding in the Program increased from $3.2 million in 2015 to $4.3 million in 2020. Program members are
supported by 14 R01-equivalent grants among 9 members. In the coming five years, Program members will
continue making novel insights into the mechanisms regulating RNA biology and cellular inheritance and
developing novel strategies to target these mechanisms as potential anti-cancer therapies."
10904823,"CELLULAR COMMUNICATION IN CANCER PROGRAM – PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Cellular Communication in Cancer (CCC) Program studies novel signaling mechanisms and tumor-host
interactions that drive cancer. Notable scientific accomplishments include (1) the development of innovative
organoid and metastatic colonization models; (2) the implementation of new imaging approaches to detect
metastases and study cancer and host cell dynamics in mice; (3) the identification of molecular pathways and
antigens that correlate with disease progression, providing therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities; (4) the
identification of mechanisms by which inflammation can drive cancer initiation and metastasis; (5) the discovery
that cachexia via IL-6 connects hepatic ketogenesis to an immune-suppressive stress response; (6) the
development of an orally bioavailable, specific inhibitor of PTP1B, an enzyme driving breast cancer metastasis;
and (7) the discovery that CXCR4-signaling confers immunosuppression. The Program has three overarching
research themes. First, members are identifying and targeting key signaling nodes in cancer initiation and
progression using advanced model systems and approaches, including murine models of metastasis, three-
dimensional organoid cultures, novel proteomics approaches, and state-of-the-art in vivo imaging methods.
Second, members are elucidating the interactions between cancer cells and host cells that drive cancer initiation
and progression. Third, members are working to understand cancer in the context of the whole-body. To that
end, CCC Program members have initiated collaborative, interdisciplinary projects to understand the
mechanisms through which (i) stress signaling, (ii) cachexia, (iii) circadian biology, (iv) chronic infection and
inflammation, and (v) organismal metabolism contribute to and are affected by cancer development and
progression. The roles of neural genes and synaptic signals in cancer progression are also being explored. The
Program is co-led by Mikala Egeblad and Linda Van Aelst and includes 14 members. Since 2015, Program
members produced a total of 145 papers (138 publications and 7 preprints). Among them, 30 (21%) resulted
from intra-programmatic collaborations, 30 (21%) resulted from inter-programmatic collaborations, 118 (81%)
involved collaborations with investigators at other institutions, and 60 (41%) were published in journals with an
impact factor greater than 10. All 14 Program members except a newly recruited member (93%) co-authored
articles with other Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cancer Center members. Program members are supported by
12 R01-equivalent grants among 6 members. Peer-reviewed funding increased from $2.7 million in 2015 to $3.5
million in 2020. The novel insights into signaling and tumor-host interactions that CCC Program members are
making will lead to a greater understanding of cancer as a systemic disease and will inform novel diagnostic and
treatment strategies."

The Antibody & Phage Display Shared Resource offers a variety of cutting-edge technologies to develop
antibodies for use as key research reagents. The Shared Resource is led by Faculty Head Adrian Krainer, Ph.D,
and Director Johannes Yeh, Ph.D. The Shared Resource collaborates with Cancer Center members to address
fundamental and compelling questions in cancer biology, in research areas including: (1) The understanding of
the tumor microenvironment; (2) The discovery of surface biomarkers and their differential expression during
tumorigenesis; and (3) Receptor signaling in cancer. Shared Resource staff work closely with scientists to select
the best approach for their experimental needs, and specialized screens are developed in close coodination with
individual scientists. The Shared Resource also tests and implements new techniques, reagents, and assay
improvements related to the different stages of antibody production. Technologies currently available in the
Shared Resource include hybridoma development by fusion of rodent spleen cells with immortalized cell lines,
generation of nanobodies from immunized alpacas, and direct cloning of the VH-VL domains from B cells from
immunized rodents or alpacas into expression plasmids. Yeast or phage display techniques are used to optimize
the binding affinities of antibodies identified after the first round of immunization and selection. A library of
hybridomas generated in the Shared Resource is maintained, and staff will produce and purify antibodies from
these lines on request. In the last funding period this Shared Resouce was used by twelve Cancer Center
members (32%), and has contributed towards seven publications by members. Novel antibodies have generated
reagents that have been used for genomics (e.g., ChIP), cell separation (e.g., FACS), and single-cell analysis.
Finally, recently developed antibodies are currently being investigated for potential diagnostic or therapeutic
applications by members, and are thus playing an essential role in cancer programs at CSHL."
10904842,"FLOW CYTOMETRY SHARED RESOURCE – PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Flow Cytometry is essential for cancer research and is widely used to identify, purify and analyze specific cell
populations. The Flow Cytometry Shared Resource has provided high-quality service and access to critical
instrumentation to members of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Cancer Center for over thirty years.
The Shared Resource is led by Faculty Head Douglas Fearon, M.D., and Senior Manager Pamela Moody. Over
the last funding period, this Shared Resource was heavily used to characterize cellular phenotypes using cell
cycle progression, DNA content, apoptosis levels, and resolving multiple cell types through the use of fluorescent
antibodies. The Shared Resource offers four state-of-the-art instruments with up to five different lasers for cell
sorting and analysis. Expert staff is also available for training in the use of equipment, consultation on
experimental design, and assistance with operation of instruments. Access to Flow Cytometry has allowed
development of protocols for single-cell sequencing, the generation and analysis of innovative animal models,
and isolation and characterization of the stem cells and immune cells involved in cancer. The Flow Cytometry
Shared Resource is well used by Cancer Center members; in the last funding period, 31 members (82% of the
membership) used this Shared Resource, accounting for 93% of its use. In the last five years, the Flow Cytometry
Shared Resource supported 61 Cancer Center publications or preprints. Without the Flow Cytometry Shared
Resource, it would be extremely difficult for individual investigators to have access to this sophisticated
instrumentation and these types of services, which are critical to their research programs. In summary, the
Shared Resource provides CSHL Cancer Center members with a complete complement of state-of-the-art
instrumentation and advanced technical support to help accelerate cancer research and discovery."

10916441,"Project Summary
The overall goal of the Neuroimaging Core (NIC) is to enhance the Cleveland Alzheimer's Disease Research
Center (CADRC) through the application of prospectively acquired advanced imaging and to provide high level
imaging data analysis support and infrastructure to CADRC cores and Alzheimer's disease and related
dementia (AD/ADRD) researchers both regionally, nationally, and through the National Alzheimer's
Coordinating Center (NACC). Specifically, the NIC will prospectively acquire high quality MRI and PET data in
CADRC participants, as well as better than 0.2mm isotropic spatial resolution ultra-high field MRI in ex-vivo
brains of donors to the CADRC. The NIC will provide neuroimaging expertise to investigators in the CADRC
and the general AD/ADRD. There are five aims of the NIC, 1) In addition to acquiring ADNI-compatible MRI
data, to collect high quality multi-modal MRI data that will permit studies of quantitative T1, T2, cerebral blood
flow, tissue microstructure, and blood brain barrier integrity, 2) to establish methods to permit acquisition of
harmonized amyloid PET images across multiple centers using latest generation scanners and techniques, 3)
acquire ultrahigh spatial resolution 7 tesla MRI images in ex-vivo brains of donors, and provide for comparison
to subsequent histopathology, 4) perform detailed quality assurance and curation of data for dissemination to
the NACC and broadly to the AD/ADRD research community, and 5) to train and mentor new and early career
investigators in advanced imaging analysis techniques. The NIC builds on the strengths of the imaging
environment in Northeast Ohio to enhance the imaging resources and data available to the AD/ADRD research
community."
10916446,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Research Education Component (REC) is aimed at fulfilling two critical needs in the Alzheimer's disease
(AD) and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (ADRD) community: 1) the number of current researchers and
clinical specialists in AD/ADRD are clearly inadequate to meet the needs of the rapid increase in the AD
population in the US and around world and 2) while we have made advances in bridging the knowledge gaps
in understanding neurodegenerative mechanisms through many years of research, advances in clinical care
are still lacking. As such, new scientists trained in the breadth of approaches with deep clinical
appreciation are required to promote progress in translational research in the AD/ADRD field and to
develop innovative and effective strategies for the diagnosis and the treatment. The REC program has
been specifically designed for selected Program Participants to provide rigorous scientific research training in
the AD/ADRD field along with extensive clinical exposure.
 The REC specifically aims to train talented and promising junior faculty and research associates and
supports their career growth with individualized Research Plan and Mentoring Plan with clearly articulated
goals. The REC emphasizes rigorous scientific training in fundamental aspects of neurodegeneration and
mechanisms of diseases involving AD/ADRD and clinical perspectives through classroom teaching, AD/ADRD-
related laboratory research and mentored neurodegenerative clinical experiences combined with educational
forums that address important topics in clinical and translational AD/ADRD research and career growth.
 The REC has identified a group of diverse promising candidates who will be encouraged to develop
new competencies under the mentorship of a faculty Mentoring committee composed of outstanding
Program Faculty including both clinical and basic researchers. The REC will also utilize the vast
educational and training resources available through CADRC-associated institutions including formal
programs, training grants, and other educational resources to enable the identified participants to advance
their research careers. This REC program will not only provide the necessary infrastructure for the training
of new AD/ADRD-related clinical/basic researchers, but also stimulate interdepartmental/interdisciplinary
collaborations among CADRC clinical and basic science researchers to serve the overall goal to accelerate
collaborative health services, interventional science, and translational neurobehavioral science research
specifically in AD/ADRD, augmenting activities of both the CADRC and national and international efforts."
10846756,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Administrative Core
Within the Massachusetts AI and Technology Center for Connected Care in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease
(MAITC), the Administrative Core will direct and support the Center’s varied initiatives, coordinate internal and
external communication, provide budgetary and financial support, and oversee the pilot project programs. The
MAITC Administrative Core will help establish a robust pilot project research program and build an extensive
network of technology researchers, stakeholders and industry representatives working to develop, validate and
deploy innovative technologies to support successful aging and care for patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
and related dementias (ADRD) at home.
To accomplish these goals, this Administrative Core will pursue three specific aims. The first aim is to
strategically direct, and provide scientific oversight, fiscal, and operational support for the MAITC by
establishing committee structures and coordinating interactions between cores. The Administrative Core will
manage committees to carry out the core’s function and manage interactions between the MAITC and the
Coordinating Center, as well as coordinate the outstanding resources available at the numerous MAITC sites
to provide a practical, well-integrated infrastructure to support pilot project teams. The second aim is to
facilitate partnerships between the MAITC and members of the industry consortium as well as external
interactions with a broad array of AI, device technology, clinical and laboratory research programs and
companies interested in supporting successful at-home aging and AD/ADRD Care. We have an outstanding
Industry Advisory Board and Industry Consortium consisting of leaders in corporations, startups and venture
capital (VC) firms and we will maintain and grow these partnerships. We will facilitate multidisciplinary
interactions within the institutions that are part of the MAITC and foster the development of new research
communities by influencing the broader research landscape in this emerging field. The third aim is to oversee a
vibrant, robust and efficient pilot project program that leverages MAITC resources to develop, feasibility-test
and validate existing and emerging AI-enhanced technologies for Healthy Aging and AD/ADRD care. The
Administrative Core will coordinate interactions between cores including needs assessment and technology
identification activities, development and issuing of the call for pilot proposals, multi-disciplinary teaming across
institutions and research areas, and the pilot project selection process. The Administrative Core will also
perform oversight functions and provide post-pilot consultation services. Through these aims, the
Administrative Core will ensure that the activities of the MAITC are conducted in an efficient, effective and
coordinated manner."
10846758,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Stakeholder Engagement Core
The Stakeholder Engagement Core supports the pilot project research process by ensuring that technologies
developed through the Massachusetts AI and Technology Center for Connected Care in Aging and Alzheimer's
Disease (MAITC) are driven by current and future needs of older adults, family members or other informal
caregivers, and clinicians. The Stakeholder Engagement Core serves as the bridge between the center’s
scientific advances in healthy aging and AD/ADRD research and those individuals who can benefit from these
advances.
In support of these goals, the Stakeholder Engagement Core has four aims. The first is to conduct a rigorous
and ongoing stakeholder needs assessment process to elicit and cohesively document older adult, family or
other informal caregiver, and clinician needs as they relate to the Aging and AD/ADRD pilot cores. The
Stakeholder Engagement Core has formed a diverse, highly qualified Stakeholder Advisory Board to help
identify the most pressing stakeholder needs in the areas of healthy aging and AD/ADRD. The Stakeholder
Engagement Core will conduct focus groups with diverse older adults and their lay caregivers to provide pilot
project teams with practical information about older adult and lay caregiver needs to justify the significance and
focus of their pilot studies, and to inform the MAITC’s technology focus areas by providing insights into
stakeholders’ perceptions of potential technologies. The second aim is to support the pilot project process by
ensuring that the pilot project solicitation requirements and chosen pilot projects are responsive to stakeholder
needs, and provide in-depth guidance for selected pilot projects to help accelerate their research. The third aim
is to ensure that end user-focused pilot project teams are using effective human-centered design thinking
methods for conducting thorough patient, informal caregiver, and clinician needs assessments, and designing
early solutions to meet those needs. The fourth aim is to broadly disseminate synthesized findings from the
stakeholder needs assessment activities and stakeholder-related findings from individual pilot projects (in
coordination with other cores). This aim will raise awareness of stakeholder needs related to technology and
aging to inform the broader research, clinician, payer, industry, and policy communities. The Stakeholder
Engagement Core will also increase the value of the pilot projects conducted via the MAITC by aiding with
broad dissemination and preparation for future funding."
10899759,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Administrative Core
The Administrative Core is responsible for establishing and maintaining the organizational structure that
provides effective managerial, scientific, and budgetary oversight for all aspects of the CCEH. This involves, in
part, establishing an Internal Advisory committee, and four Core-specific user committees composed primarily
of research base members and at least one non-member user. An External Advisory committee will be
described after the Coordinating Center comes on line. The Administrative Core will promote and ensure
communication among these groups, which will, in turn, serve to inform new initiatives and optimize core
development and utilization. Another key function of the Administrative Core is to provide guidance and
oversight for generating and using program income. Program income is used to increase core staffing and
supply budgets to meet growing user demand, and to introduce new technologies. Program income also
supports internal pilot awards and the Enrichment Program, both of which are implemented and overseen by
the Administrative Core. This Core also provides follow-up for all pilot awardees and for data generated with
CCEH support to ensure it is entered when appropriate into the publicly searchable data archive for annotated
data, techniques, and protocols currently under development for the purpose of data sharing.
The Administrative Core is led by Drs. Beverly Torok-Storb, CCEH Director and Derek Stirewalt, Associate
Director. Dr. Torok-Storb has successfully led the Fred Hutch CCEH and its Administrative Core from its
inception in 1999 as a P30-supported CCEH. Dr. Stirewalt seamlessly stepped in as Associate Director in
2017. Fifteen years of experience administering the CCEH have taught us that the Administrative Core will play
a critical role in all CCEH decision-making."
10899763,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - Cell Manipulation Tools Core (Tools)
The recent characterization of the human genome combined with powerful new sequence-directed gene
manipulation technologies have revolutionized our ability to ask biological questions, identify and manipulate
disease causing alterations, and create targeted therapeutics. However, serious barriers still exist for
individual researchers attempting to perform and assess genome manipulations. This is particularly true for
applications involving human hematopoietic cell products, which require specialized knowledge and functional
assays. The mission of the Tools Core is to act as an interface between cutting edge genome manipulation
techniques and researchers and clinicians to provide access to protocols, reagents, and consultants for genetic
alteration of human and canine hematopoietic cell products. The ultimate goal of the Tools Core is to break
down access barriers and provide appropriate infrastructure and support for functional genetic and viral vector
technology platforms in hematopoietic cell products.
The Tools Core will be directed by Drs. Kiem and Paddison who have outstanding track records in the fields of
viral vector-mediated gene therapy, functional genomics, gene editing, vector production, and stem and
progenitor cell manipulation.
Functions of the Tools Core include provision of reagents for user-performed genome manipulations, best
practices protocols, consultations for manipulation of hematopoietic cell products, gene edited cell products,
and development of new technology to improve gene editing and viral vector performance."
