The program objective is to train predoctoral and postdoctoral biostatisticians in statistical theory and methods
and collaboration as applied to environmental health sciences (EHS). The grant is administered through the
Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology (DBCB), in collaboration with the Departments of
Environmental Medicine and Public Health Sciences. The eleven trainers are faculty in these departments,
seven of whom are from DBCB. Training: The DBCB offers a PhD degree in Statistics, with a Bioinformatics
and Computational Biology option, providing rigorous and state-of-the art statistical training. All pre- and
postdoctoral trainees work on applied EHS projects under joint mentorship of a DBCB and an EHS trainer.
These projects include the Seychelles Child Development Study, which examines neurodevelopmental effects
of prenatal exposure to mercury and nutrients from fish consumption, and studies of the reproductive effects of
phthalates, perfluoroalkyl substances, bisphenol A, and maternal stress. Involvement in these studies
provides trainees with both statistical and EHS training, gives experience in reproducible research and
communication, and often motivates trainees' methodologic research. Further EHS training is obtained
through courses in epidemiology and toxicology, as well as lab tours and seminars customized to the trainees.
Postdoctoral trainees enroll in DBCB and EHS courses appropriate to their experience and interest, work on
EHS projects, and participate in all T32-related activities. All trainees present their work at local and national
conferences. Program oversight is provided via monthly meetings of the T32 Executive Committee and annual
evaluations by the External Advisory Board, and makes use of trainee evaluations to improve the program.
Trainee selection: Emphasis is placed on recruiting trainees from diverse backgrounds and increasing
representation of under-represented groups in the biostatistics profession. Successful applicants to the
Statistics PhD program in DBCB will have completed a baccalaureate degree with a major in mathematics or
statistics, or in science with a strong minor in mathematics or statistics. Predoctoral trainees for this training
program are selected from among the Statistics PhD students, generally begin T32 support after two years of
in the PhD program, and are appointed for up to four years. Postdoctoral trainees must have completed a PhD
in statistics, mathematics, epidemiology or a related discipline, or have basic science training with strong
quantitative skills, and are supported for up to three years. The program supports three predoctoral and one
postdoctoral trainee."
10832534,"Program Abstract
The goal of this training program is to provide the skill-set necessary for translational surgeon-
scientists focused on pediatric diseases. Only 3% of T32 programs in the United States are focused
on training surgeon-scientists, and only 1 surgical research training program in pediatrics currently
exists in Urology. Pediatric surgical diseases are unique because the vast majority result from
congenital anomalies. Consequently, pediatric surgical disciplines require specialized training to be
best equipped for a translational research career focused on children. This program will provide a 2-
year postdoctoral fellowship in translational basic research for individuals in a surgery residency who
are planning on a career as a pediatric surgeon. A total of 3 fellows in the program at one time will
receive broad training in the fields of vascular diseases and vascular biology. Vascular anomalies
affect 5% of the population and involve every anatomical location and organ system. Consequently,
all pediatric surgical specialists manage these disorders. Because vascular biology is applicable to
almost all pediatric diseases, graduates will be able to apply the skills learned to a broad range of
pediatric conditions. The training program consists of 8 pediatric surgical departments and programs.
The 13 program faculty are experts in pediatric surgical diseases, vascular anomalies, and/or
vascular biology and include surgeon-scientists and basic scientists. The postdoctoral fellows will be
based in one of the faculty’s laboratories and will have independent mentored research projects (70%
effort), didactic training in translational research methodology (15% effort), participation in
conferences and clinics (10% effort), and guidance by a Mentorship Committee to facilitate their
transition to independent research careers in pediatric surgery (5% effort). The postdoctoral fellows
will be in an outstanding environment to succeed, supported by an internationally-recognized
Pediatric Medical and Research Institution, Vascular Anomalies Center, Vascular Biology Program,
Lymphedema Program, and Departments of Cardiac Surgery, General Surgery, Neurosurgery,
Orthopedic Surgery, and Plastic Surgery. The program faculty have a long history of collaboration
and a proven track-record of successful research funding and mentoring. This unique training
program will produce the next generation of pediatric surgeon-scientists with the skill-set necessary to
improve the lives of children through innovative translational research."
10833111,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a multifocal angioproliferative tumor affecting the skin, oral mucosa, lymph nodes and
visceral organs. Common factors for KS development include infection with the oncogenic herpesvirus Kaposi
sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV8) and immune deregulation. While ART has reduced KS incidence in the
Western world, it remains the most common AIDS-associated malignancy worldwide. Growing knowledge of KS
has improved treatment options, but it remains an incurable cancer causing significant morbidity and mortality,
particularly in resource-limited regions. Thus, there is an urgent need for effective and affordable novel therapies
for use in combination with, or instead of, conventional therapies. KSHV profoundly alters the transcriptome of
the host cell, significantly influencing the function of multiple cellular homeostatic and adaptive pathways.
Interrogation of these pathways has identified a number of components as potential therapeutic targets for KS,
but significant gaps in our knowledge of the virus-host interaction hamper progress. In this application, we focus
specifically on two important and inter-connected host cell pathways that are influenced by KSHV infection, iron
metabolism and the antioxidant pathway, and investigate why KSHV-infected EC are resistant to ferroptosis, an
iron-dependent form of regulated cell death that is characterized by accumulation of ROS and lethal oxidative
damage to phospholipids. To support abnormal growth, tumor cells typically have a higher iron need, which is
satisfied through altered expression of genes regulating iron uptake, utilization and storage. Our preliminary data
suggest that KS resembles other cancers in this regard and directly implicate KSHV in this phenotype. Notably,
in vitro infection of lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) results in deregulation of iron metabolism genes and
development of an iron-responsive growth phenotype. While iron fuels tumor growth, iron addiction presents a
paradox: how to maintain redox homeostasis and resist ferroptotic death? Many tumor cells achieve this balance
with an enhanced antioxidant response that includes activation of ferroptosis suppressor pathways to resist lethal
lipid peroxidation. Our data show that KSHV upregulates SLC7A11 (xCT), a critical initiator of the canonical
xCT/GSH/GPX4 ferroptosis suppressor pathway, and that KSHV-infected cells are uniquely susceptible to
ferroptotic death when xCT is inhibited. In addition, KSHV upregulates the newly-identified anti-ferroptotic gene,
ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1), which functions through an independent, CoQ-dependent, pathway to
suppress ferroptosis, thus presenting an alternate target for the selective elimination of KSHV-infected cells. In
this application, we will test the innovative premise that KSHV reprograms host cell metabolism both to acquire
iron for growth and to activate two independent but complementary ferroptosis suppressor pathways. We
hypothesize that this reprogramming, while important for tumor growth and survival, creates unique points of
vulnerability that can be therapeutically exploited."
10833116,"The complexity and multifactorial nature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pose unique challenges for mechanistic
studies and developing therapies. Although many transgenic mouse models have been generated for AD
research and these models are important for our understanding of the pathological basis of the disease, none
of them has captured the entire spectrum of the disease pathologies. This is likely due to significant species
differences between mouse and human neural cells. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish human
disease modeling platforms to complement studies in animal models for AD research. Since the advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology a decade ago, human iPSCs (hiPSCs) have been widely used for disease modeling and drug discovery. However, given the relative immaturity of cells differentiated from hiPSCs, it is challenging to use them for modeling late-onset diseases, such as AD, for which cellular aging is important in disease pathologies. Direct reprogramming is an alternative cellular reprogramming technology, which allows direct conversion of one type of cells, such as fibroblasts, into another type of cells, such as neural stem cells (NSCs) or neurons. It has been shown that direct reprogramming enables generation of human neurons that possess key elements of cellular aging, because this reprogramming process does not go through the iPSC stage involving extensive epigenetic modifications. While the strongest risk factor for AD is aging, the strongest genetic risk factor of AD is apolipoprotein E4
(apoE4). Among the three isoforms of human apoE (apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4), apoE4 increases AD risk,
apoE3 is neutral, and apoE2 is protective. Although the roles of apoE4 in AD pathogenesis have been
extensively studied, the protective roles of apoE2 in AD have been surprisingly understudied. Clearly, better
understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying apoE2’s protective roles in AD will likely
provide novel targets or signaling pathways for anti-AD drug development, especially for late-onset AD.
 The objectives of this proposal are to develop aging-relevant human neuron models of late-onset AD, using
direct reprogramming technology in combination with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, and to dissect the
underlying mechanisms of apoE2’s protective roles in AD. We propose three complementary aims to
accomplish the goals. Aim 1: To generate isogenic human fibroblast lines with an apoE2/2 or apoE3/3
genotype from the parental human fibroblast lines with an apoE4/4 genotype as cell sources for direct
reprogramming. Aim 2: To dissect the protective roles of apoE2 and their underlying mechanisms using
directly reprogrammed human neurons and astrocytes. Aim 3: To dissect the protective roles of apoE2 and
their underlying mechanisms using directly reprogrammed NSC-derived neurons and astrocytes. The
outcomes of the proposed studies will promote our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms
underlying apoE2’s protective roles in AD, and will likely identify novel targets for anti-AD drug development."
10833120,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cellular metabolic pathways exhibit remarkable plasticity across different cell types in both development and
disease. In addition to accompanying changes in cell state, metabolic rewiring has been shown to drive cell fate
decisions programs by altering the chromatin landscape. The deposition of chemical modifications that decorate
chromatin requires the intermediates of metabolic pathways, and several enzymes that remove these marks use
metabolites as part of their enzymatic reaction. Therefore, fluctuations in metabolite levels have the capacity to
shape chromatin to effect cell fate-specific gene expression, but the metabolic changes that drive chromatin
reorganization and the enzymes that mediate metabolic control of cell fate during early development remain
largely unknown. We have previously identified specific metabolites that control self-renewal of mouse embryonic
stem cells (ESCs). Whether metabolism is altered as ESCs exit the self-renewing pluripotent state, and whether
these metabolic changes are required for multi-lineage differentiation remains an open question.
The goal of this research proposal is to characterize the metabolic rewiring that occurs during exit from
naïve pluripotency and to determine the mechanisms by which this rewiring controls mouse ESC
differentiation. Our preliminary data indicate that exit from naïve pluripotency is accompanied by an increase
in the mitochondrial export of citrate. In Aim 1, we will use genetic and pharmacologic approaches to target the
mitochondrial citrate transporter SLC25A1 or the downstream citrate-catabolizing enzyme ATP-citrate lyase to
test the hypothesis that mitochondrially-derived citrate is required for early differentiation. We will investigate
whether this metabolic change regulates cell fate through the deposition of citrate-derived histone acetylation
marks. Preliminary data also shows changes in cellular redox state marked by an increase in the cytosolic
NAD+/NADH ratio during early differentiation. In Aim 2, we will determine if this metabolic change is required for
exit from naïve pluripotency by modulating the NAD+/NADH ratio using pharmacological or genetic tools. Further
experiments will identify the mechanism by which cellular redox state signals to the chromatin landscape to
dictate cell fate. These studies will reveal the mechanisms of metabolic control during exit from naïve pluripotency
and will provide critical insight into how metabolic regulation contributes to changes in cell identity during
embryonic development. The work and training plan outlined in this proposal will be completed in the laboratory
of Dr. Lydia Finley with the co-advisement of Dr. Kristian Helin at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and
will ideally prepare the applicant for further clinical training and a career as an independent physician-scientist."
10833047,"Uncovering Life Course Constellations of Exposures through Big Data on Place, Time, and Family
Factors
Project Abstract
This project will trace the mortality of birth cohorts of the early 20th century in the US by place, time, and family
factors. Combining “big data” with a large array of contextual exposures, we substantially deepen our
understanding of the complexities of how childhood exposures to disease, economic change, and natural
disasters shape old age mortality profiles of cohorts born ~1910-1930. We fuse together hypothesis driven
tests, data driven discoveries, and omnibus measures from variance decompositions. Our proposal combines
the massive CenSoc data, which contains >15 million death records between 1975-2005 to test specific
hypotheses as well as generate new hypotheses around the main, interactive, and cumulative effects of
exposures during sensitive periods of development that may shape mortality experiences of these cohorts.
Our interdisciplinary group of sociologists, demographers, economists, epidemiologists and others combines
our expertise with the CenSoc data as well as with testing hypotheses from the Developmental Origins of Adult
Health and Disease theories to pursue an interconnected set of specific aims to push forward the frontier of
understanding the complex links between early life exposures and later life mortality.
Aim 1 begins with a set of variance decompositions stratified by time and place across the early 20th century in
order to construct an “Atlas” of estimates of the importance of family background (sibling correlations) as well
as shared environmental factors (childhood neighbor correlations) determining old age mortality experiences at
the close of the 20th century. We then ask whether these estimates are shaped by major disease events and
the extent to which the patterns are explained through socioeconomic status markers in mid life. Aim 2 pivots
from the forest to the trees by leveraging “natural experiment” research designs to estimate causal main and
interactive effects of specific early life exposures and how these effects vary by sex, geography, and family
background. We then make use of machine learning tools to synthesize estimates that may vary by age of
exposure, sequence of exposures, and domain of exposures during early life. These models explore impacts of
cumulative exposures, dynamic complementarity of exposures and potential for reversibility of early insults
using well powered analysis not available elsewhere. Aim 3 concludes our analysis by pushing the frontier of
intergenerational analysis by using data in previous aims to link back to parental information on exposures and
ask whether parental exposures affect the next generation’s old age mortality as well as whether the effects of
exposures interact across generations."

Only 13% of the 780,000 adults living with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have normal cognitive function. We
found that 14.0% of ESRD patients aged 35-49 experience severe cognitive impairment and 2.9% have a co-
occurring functional dependence suggestive of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (AD/ADRD). After
dialysis initiation older (≥65) patients experience a 21-25% lifetime risk of AD/ADRD. Younger ESRD patients
experience premature cognitive aging requiring the study of cognition and AD/ADRD across the lifespan. Black
ESRD patients are more than twice as likely to develop cognitive impairment and 70%-78% more likely to be
diagnosed with AD/ADRD; this disparity is comparable to a 10 year increase in age. While systemic racism is a
known contributor to health disparities in community-dwelling older adults, its impact on cognitive aging among
ESRD patients is understudied. Measurement of systemic racism (i.e., structural, institutional, and
interpersonal) is crucial to identifying ESRD patients who are at risk of premature cognitive aging and those
who are resilient in the face of racism. Elucidating mechanisms by which systemic racism impacts cognitive
aging will lead to interventions and policies that may prevent the devastation of AD/ADRD for 234,000 Black
ESRD patients. We seek to address a National Institute on Aging (NIA) goal (RFA-MD-21-004): “To elucidate
whether and how mechanisms connecting structural racism to aging-relevant outcomes, including cognition
and AD/ADRD, operate on multiple levels.” ESRD patients are the ideal population to elucidate these
mechanisms: 1) 30% of patients are Black; 2) 87% experience premature cognitive aging; 3) all enroll in a
national registry and 65% in Medicare for measurement of institutional racism. For all adult ESRD patients in
the national registry/Medicare database, we will glean 23 indicators of structural racism from publicly available
data and identify 3 indicators of institutional racism. Then, we will link these data to our ongoing, NIA-funded,
multi-center, prospective cohort study (FAIR, n=5,275) of aging and ESRD to fully characterize systemic
racism (lifecourse structural racism, institutional racism, and interpersonal racism). This is the oldest (>12
years) ESRD cohort study that includes longitudinal measures global and domain specific cognitive function.
The National Kidney Foundation, Alzheimer’s Association, and a local community advisory board will guide the
design and interpretation of the following aims: 1) To estimate the impact of structural and institutional racism
on incident AD/ADRD; 2) To quantify the contributions of lifecourse systemic racism on cognitive impairment
and decline; and 3) To test whether resilience to systemic racism protects against cognitive impairment and
decline. By taking a lifecourse approach and engaging community, family, and patient stakeholders in all
phases of our study, we will identify feasible targets for improving resilience in the face of systemic racism.
These potential targets for interventions and policies to counter structural racism will likely generalize to other
populations with chronic diseases."
10833175,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Among the half a million childhood cancer survivors alive in the US today, the most commonly reported non-
cancer severe, life-threatening, or fatal chronic condition is cardiovascular disease (CVD) . It is the leading non-
cancer cause of premature death in this population. Heart radiation and anthracycline exposure have been
associated with a variety of CVD outcomes including cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), and
heart valve disease. Investigations of radiation therapy (RT)-related CVD have typically established
associations based solely on whole heart dose metrics; thus, overlooking the heterogeneity of the organ and its
substructures. Our team was the first to report data demonstrating substructure-level dose response of CVD
risk in childhood cancer survivors. Despite establishing distinct radiosentivities, cardiac substructure dose
constraints are not commonly incorporated into RT treatment planning due to the lack o f validated risk
prediction models, thus, missing opportunities to prospectively optimize RT planning and retrospectively
personalize risk-counseling and long-term cardiovascular surveillance in current and future cancer survivors.
The goal of the proposed project is to develop and validate novel CVD risk prediction models that incorporate
cardiac substructure doses. Further, we propose to develop tools to clinically translate these models into
effective personalized treatment paradigms with prospective and retrospective applications for care providers
to reduce CVD risk. We will: (1) develop and validate risk prediction models for cardiomyopathy, CAD, and
heart valve disease incorporating cardiac RT substructure doses, adjusting for demographics and
chemotherapy exposures; and (2) integrate CVD risk prediction models into commercial RT treatment planning
systems and web-based applications, and establish their use via in-silico studies of contemporary patients
treated with RT.
This will be the first investigation to use the unique radiosensitivity of different cardiac substructures as the
foundation for models that can predict the risk of specific types of CVD in children newly diagnosed with cancer
as well as among long-term survivors. Incorporating the substructure doses into prediction models will
significantly advance clinical care for both prospective RT treatment planning and retrospect ive risk
assessments. Prospectively, late CVD risk could be decreased in future survivors by optimizing delivery of
chest-directed RT with cardiac substructure dose constraints and selecting the plan that confers the lowest
risk, while maintaining optimal clinical target volume coverage. Retrospectively post treatment, the clinical team
can provide evidence-based personalized risk mitigation counseling, based on individualized risk profiles
determined from delivered cardiac substructure doses adjusted for chemotherapy exposures and
demographics. Successful execution of the proposed project has the potential to transform clinical practice for
treatment of childhood and adolescent patients with cancer."
10833214,"Program Summary
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a major life threatening complication in patients
with AIDS and in patients undergoing immunotherapy for autoimmune diseases such as multiple
sclerosis, Crohn's disease, severe plaque psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosis, hematologic
malignancies, and rheumatoid arthritis. The disease is paradoxically caused by a common human
polyomavirus following the loss of normal immune surveillance of the central nervous system (CNS).
There are several major gaps in our understanding of the basic biology that underpins the
development of PML. First, the anatomical site of virus persistence is not known but kidney, bone
marrow, and brain have all been postulated to be involved. Second, the mechanisms that govern viral
persistence are not well defined but changes in the viral promoter (archetype to PML-type) and
regulation of a viral microRNA are thought to be critical for transition to the lytic phase. Third, the
mechanisms of viral spread to the CNS and within the CNS are not known. Based on our recent work
we hypothesize that free virus as well as virus enclosed in extracellular vesicles spreads from the
kidney to the choroid plexus and meningeal compartments where replication in CPE cells provides the
means for EV mediated invasion of brain parenchyma. Once in the brain extracellular vesicle
mediated spread is likely to play the major role in spreading the infection because macroglia lack the
principle cellular receptors to support infection by free virus. Our vision for the R35 application is to
further our understanding of these basic mechanisms of infectious spread of virus and to use the
information to identify biomarkers that can predict PML early and in easily accessible compartments
well before the virus has a chance to spread to the CNS. The work should also lead to the
development of novel strategies to treat and prevent PML."

Project 2. Uncovering Mechanisms of the Lymphoid Oncogenesis of Epstein-Barr Virus and Kaposi’s
Sarcoma Herpesvirus
Bill Sugden, Project Leader; Paul Lambert and Eric Johannsen, Co-Leaders
EBV causes several lymphoid cancers; EBV and KSHV together cause Primary Effusion Lymphomas (PELs).
We have uncovered previously unrecognized cellular drivers of Burkitt Lymphomas (BL) caused by EBV with
screens using CRISPR/Cas9 and sgRNAs to all human genes in early passage BL cells. PEL and BL are AIDS-
defining malignancies. We have developed a new approach to inhibit EBV in these early passage BL cells after
the comprehensive CRISPR screen and identified cellular genes which EBV must regulate for the lymphomas
to be maintained. These approaches have worked and ensure that our collaboration with Dr. Johannsen to
screen EBV+ DLBCLs in Project 4 will be informative. We are examining our newly developed co-transformation
of peripheral and tonsillar B-cells with EBV and KSHV to elucidate it mechanistically. We focus on EBV because
its causal role in PEL was formerly unappreciated. We are collaborating with Dr. Paul F. Lambert (Project 1), to
define EBV’s and KSHV's roles in PEL tumorigenesis studying co-transformed cells as xenografts in NSG mice.
These cells grow better in the peritoneal cavities of NSG mice than do cells infected only with EBV and express
genes characteristic of bona fide PELs. We are testing contributions of the peritoneal cavity to the tumor-growth
of co-transformed cells and PEL cell lines."

Eric Johannsen, Core Leader
Core C (Virus Core) provides time and cost-efficient generation, validation, distribution, and archival storage of
wild-type (WT) and mutant viruses needed by all 6 research groups of this Program Project for their proposed
studies. The Specific Aims are: (1) to produce validated stocks of WT, mutant, and revertant Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) and Kaposi Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV); (2) to produce validated stocks of infectious mouse
papillomavirus (MmuPV1) and human papillomavirus (HPV) pseudoviruses; and (3) to produce validated
lentivirus library stocks. Mutant EBV (for Projects 2, 3, and 4) or KSHV (for Project 2) will be generated in E. coli
starting with appropriate BACs using the scarless En Passant method.1 We can also make mutants, when
appropriate in eukaryotic cells using CRISPR/Cas9 editing. In addition to standard methods, we have established
a bioinformatic pipeline to analyze next generation sequencing data of herpesvirus genomes to ensure there are
no unintended mutations within their unique regions. Whenever necessary, phenotypes will be validated using
trans-complementation or the construction of revertant EBV/KSHV genomes. Virus stocks of WT, mutant, and
revertant variants of EBV or KSHV will be generated using a protocol developed by Dr. Sugden, titered, and
stored for use by all three EBV groups. Papillomavirus virions and pseudovirions will be generated (for Project
1) by co-transfection of 293T cells with (i) the desired capsid protein-expression plasmids, and (ii) the desired
viral or luciferase/GFP-encoding DNAs targeted for encapsidation using protocols previously published by the
Lambert/Ahlquist laboratories. Lentivirus libraries will be packaged and tittered using standardized protocols for
use in Projects 2 and 4. Lenti and retrovirus transduction vectors with different antibiotic resistance genes have
been generated and will be provided to Projects to allow transduction of multiple genes into cells. In addition to
increased cost efficiency and quality control, the existence of this Core facilitates the use of common virus stocks
that facilitate the interpretation of complementary data generated among the various research groups to foster
shared aims within the projects. All 6 research groups associated with the 4 projects will be served by this Core
facility."
10907840,"Project Summary/Abstract
Human arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2) is an -helical membrane protein expressed in the collecting
ducts of the kidneys involved in regulating urine volume. Mutations of AVPR2 at some 96 sites are known to
cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), likely by promoting misfolding. The vasopressin antagonist drugs
(“vaptans”) have been shown to rescue cell-surface expression, putatively by acting as chaperones stabilizing the
native folded state. Thus, understanding the relative energetics of the folded and misfolded states in the presence
and absence of ligands would shed light on the native structural dynamics of AVPR2 and how those dynamics
are changed by disease-causing mutations. Such results would be relevant to NDI, and also more generally to
diseases arising from G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, the established biochemical technique of
chemical denaturation in detergent micelles that is used to measure membrane-protein thermodynamic stability
(G) and its change upon mutation or ligand binding (G) suffers from several limitations that make it
unsuitable for studies of AVPR2. In particular, the non-native detergent environment, the poorly defined
denatured state with significant residual secondary structure, and the need to extrapolate from high denaturant
concentration cause the measured energetics to poorly reflect the underlying, biologically relevant molecular
values. Most significantly, chemical-denaturation-based techniques have never been successfully applied to
GPCRs because GPCRs do not globally refold when the denaturant is removed. These shortcomings motivate the
overall aim of this proposal: to develop alternate techniques for measuring membrane-protein energetics, based
on force-induced unfolding rather than chemical denaturation. Such techniques, implemented on an atomic
force microscope (AFM), can study membrane proteins in the native lipid bilayer and obviate the problem of
globally reversible unfolding by probing a small portion of the protein at a time. Work during the postdoctoral
K99 phase will use the model membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR) to further develop these force-based
techniques. Two particular aims will be achieved: (1) measurement of point-mutant free energy changes of bR in
its native bilayer and without confounding chemical denaturant and (2) quantification of the energetics of a
photo-activated ligand isomerization in bR. Completing this work during the K99 phase will establish the basis
for the aim of the independent R00 phase: to elucidate the folding and ligand-interaction energetics of AVPR2
using these new techniques. In addition to providing specific insight into AVPR2 folding and misfolding, this
work will establish a new paradigm in which energetic measurements can be made directly in biomedically
relevant systems like AVPR2, rather than just in model systems. The transition to independence will also be
facilitated by training during the K99 phase, most notably in the expression and purification of GPCR samples.
The University of Colorado provides world-class facilities for carrying out this work, and co-mentors will offer
expertise in both single-molecule AFM experiments and membrane-protein biochemistry."

Min. Dr. Min is a third-year Infectious Diseases Fellow in the American Board of Internal Medicine Research
Pathway Residency/Fellowship in Infectious Diseases at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Her
research focuses on HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), specifically investigating the role and
function of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) that has well-established anti-inflammatory properties through
activation of cannabinoid receptors type 1 (CB1R) and type 2 (CB2R). Her study proposes that CB2R agonism
reduces neuroinflammation associated with HAND, which currently lacks effective therapies despite affecting up
to 50% of people with HIV-1 (PWH). Findings from this study will enhance our mechanistic understanding of the
anti-inflammatory properties of CB2R in central nervous system (CNS) HIV-1 infection and can lead to novel
therapeutic paradigms for HAND in PWH. This K08 award will provide Dr. Min with advanced training in the
following areas: 1) To develop as an HIV virologist with her own laboratory by taking advantage of the
unparalleled expertise of faculty and fellows at Mount Sinai and collaborators; 2) To communicate, interact, and
collaborate with research colleagues in HIV studies and infectious diseases, in the United States and around the
world; 3) To devote 20-25% of her efforts towards developing skills and knowledge as a clinician in infectious
diseases; and 4) To develop preliminary data that will serve as the foundation for a future R01 that will support
transition to research independence. To achieve these goals, Dr. Min has assembled a multidisciplinary mentor
team. Dr. Talia H. Swartz, her primary mentor, is a successful physician-scientist whose expertise is in pro-
inflammatory comorbidities associated with chronic HIV-1 infection. Her co-mentors are Dr. Benjamin K. Chen,
a renowned HIV-1 virologist and pioneer in HIV-host cell interactions, and Dr. Schahram Akbarian, a
distinguished neuroscientist specializing in epigenomic and epitranscriptomic technologies using mouse models.
An additional scientific advisory committee composed of highly regarded principal investigators in the fields of
stem cell biology, molecular neuroscience, neuropathology, and NeuroHIV will provide additional guidance. Her
mentors and advisory team will guide Dr. Min throughout her training. The proposed experiments and didactics
outlined in this proposal will position Dr. Min with a unique set of interdisciplinary skills and resources that will
enable her to transition to independence as a physician-scientist specializing in NeuroHIV. Dr. Min is firmly
committed to a career in translational NeuroHIV research and is strongly supported in her career and research
goals by her mentors and her division at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai."
10838846,"The female genital tract (FGT) is colonized by millions of microbial taxa that have far reaching effects on
reproductive health. Resident bacteria in the FGT affect mucosal immune responses, alter the risk of STI
acquisition, and predict maternal health and birth outcomes, with lactobacilli typically associated with reduced
overall bacterial diversity, inflammation, and risk of STI acquisition. Conversely, communities with little
representation of Lactobacillus and an increased abundance of diverse anaerobes are characterized as
Bacterial Vaginonsis (BV) and are associated with elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, heightened risk of
STI acquisition and adverse birth outcomes, vaginal discharge, and other sequelae. However, the mechanisms
underlying transitions to BV and its high recurrence rates after antibiotic treatment (~50%) remain unknown.
The vaginal virome remains largely uncharacterized outside of a few families of DNA viruses associated with
adverse conditions (Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae), with the RNA virome even less studied. Bacteriophages,
including integrated prophages, are powerful mediators of bacterial community structure and dynamics across
environments, though we know little of bacterial-phage interactions in the the FGT. This study proposes that
the vaginal virome is one of the factors influencing transitions to BV, either by eliciting mucosal immune
responses directly, or via bacterial-phage dynamics, including prophage induction via abiotic stressors. This
proposal will utilize samples already collected from the Evidence for Contraceptive Options and HIV Outcomes
(ECHO) Trial to longitudinally characterize (via shotgun metagenomics) interactions between viral and bacterial
taxa in participants who do not experience BV (20), participants who experience and clear incident BV (20),
and participants who experience persistent BV (20) (Aim 1). We will use strain-resolved analyses to identify
alterations in prophage abundance, as well as non-integrated viruses, and we will integrate these data with
measurements of 27 cytokines measured previously. In Aim 2, we will characterize the vaginal viral and
bacterial metagenomes in our full cohort of participants that seroconverted (28) during our substudy and
compare those with the same number of matched controls, identifying alterations in the abundance and
functionality of bacterial and viral taxa between groups. In Aim 3, we will follow up the results from our previous
work demonstrating that a copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) shifted vaginal bacteria toward BV states. We
will sequence the bacterial and viral metagenomes across the full subset of women randomized to the Cu-IUD
(60) prior to initiation and after six months of use to identify if Cu2+ released from the IUD induced prophages
into lytic replication using strain resolved analyses similar to Aim 1, with special attention to lactobacilli
prophages. We will assess the results from our metagenomic analyses in vitro via culture experiments using
Cu2+ for prophage induction. Together, these aims will provide a characterization of the vaginal virome and its
contributions to BV and associated sequelae, including HIV acquisition."
10840321,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health concern. After TBI, elderly patients suffer from higher
mortality rate and worse functional outcome compared to young patients. A further complication in the treatment
of TBI occurs due to lack of clear knowledge on sex differences in TBI. The influence of biological age and sex
on the outcomes of TBI is an important but understudied area of research and one of the major reasons for the
limited success observed in several TBI-related clinical trials is, attributed to their failure to account for critical
sex and age-related differences in disease expression. Considering this gap in knowledge, the major goal of our
proposal is to conduct a pre-clinical study that focuses on the influence of age and sex in TBI. One of the most
devastating clinical symptoms of TBI is the formation of cerebral edema leading to an increase in intracranial
pressure that impairs cerebral perfusion and oxygenation, and contributes to additional ischemic injuries.
Maintaining integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the protective barrier of the brain, and the prevention of
the leakage of fluid and proteins from small blood vessels to the extravascular space (microvascular
hyperpermeability) are critical to preventing and treating brain vasogenic edema. We propose a novel paradigm
of age and sex dependent changes in microvascular hyperpermeability following TBI, and evaluate if an
inflammatory-mediated signaling mechanism responsible for this hyperpermeability is age and sex dependent.
Our overarching goal is to understand how age and sex of an individual differentially influence vascular
permeability and leading to cerebral edema formation following TBI and ultimately develop new and effective
therapeutics for head trauma patients of all ages/sex. In this proposal, we will investigate how age and sex
differentially control microvascular permeability and molecular pathways that lead to activation of Neutrophil
Extracellular Traps (NET) and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling resulting in vascular hyperpermeability, following
TBI and how age and sex influence this pathway. Our central hypothesis is that age/sex differentially influence
microvascular permeability, cerebral fluid dynamics and outcomes of TBI, in an NET/NLRP3 inflammasome-
dependent manner. Increased NET formation that occurs following TBI promotes NLRP3 inflammasome-
mediated endothelial tight junction (TJ) breakdown, hyperpermeability and cerebral edema formation in an age
and sex dependent manner. Our specific aims are to: 1) Determine the influence of age and sex on microvascular
hyperpermeability following TBI; 2) Determine the upstream regulators of microvascular hyperpermeability
following TBI and the influence of age and sex. The proposed novel, integrated approach capitalizes on a refined
and relevant mouse model of TBI combined with intravital microscopic imaging of microcirculation, thin-section
and feeze-fracture electron microscopy of tight junctions, analysis of cerebral fluid dynamics and cellular and
molecular biology approaches. Understanding these novel principles will help us find new ways to treat and
prevent cerebral edema in head trauma patients in the future, irrespective of their age and sex."
10840327,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 A widely conserved hallmark of aging is the decline in muscle mass and strength, promoting frailty, loss of
independence and disability. Crucial for this is our gap in knowledge regarding mechanisms linking bioenergetic
stimulation to muscle anabolism. Glucocorticoid steroids have pervasive effects on energy metabolism and
muscle function. Dosing intermittence appears crucial to the benefits/risks ratio of these drugs in dystrophic
animal models and patients, i.e. in genetic myopathies. Here we investigate whether intermittent glucocorticoids
increase performance in aged muscle, where weakness and sarcopenia are not dependent on specific genetic
insults. Our new results in 24 months-old WT mice show that a chronic regimen of intermittent once-weekly
prednisone increased muscle performance in aging mice to levels comparable to young adult mice (4 months-
old). Remarkably, treatment rescued both mitochondrial respiration and muscle mass in aging mice to young-
like levels. Mechanistically, we found that bioenergetic, functional and anabolic effects of intermittent prednisone
were blunted upon inducible ablation of PGC1a in adult muscle. While the role of PGC1a in boosting
mitochondrial capacity in aged muscle is more established, its effects on age-related sarcopenia and weakness
are still debated with conflicting results from constitutive knockout or overexpression models. Scattered reports
have hinted at a role of PGC1a in activating growth pathways, including biosynthesis of amino acids like alanine,
but this is still largely unknown in muscle aging. Here we will investigate the mechanisms through which a
bioenergetic stimulation like intermittent prednisone rescues both oxidative metabolism and mass gain in muscle
aging. In Aim 1, we will determine the extent to which intermittence discriminates deleterious versus beneficial
effects of glucocorticoids in aging muscle. We hypothesize that dosing intermittence shifts exogenous
glucocorticoid effects from a PGC1a-lowering pro-wasting program to a PGC1a-dependent pro-ergogenic
program, i.e. balanced gain of performance and mass. We will test this through inducible muscle-specific PGC1a
ablation after natural aging. In Aim 2 we will establish the role of muscle Lipin1 in PGC1a re-activation in muscle
aging. We hypothesize that Lipin1 supports mitochondrial function in muscle aging and mediates the PGC1a re-
activation in response to intermittent glucocorticoids. To test this, we will use our newly derived mice with muscle-
restricted inducible Lipin1 ablation after natural aging. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the extent to which bioenergetics
rescue sarcopenia in aging through amino acid biosynthesis. We hypothesize that mitochondrial reactivation
fuels amino acid biogenesis, supporting protein synthesis during muscle aging. We will test this by tracing
glucose-derived carbons into amino acids in oxidative versus glycolytic myofibers. We will also test the extent to
which muscle PGC1a mediates these effects in young versus aging muscle. In summary, here we leverage the
unprecedented effects of intermittent glucocorticoids to discern unrecognized mechanisms of aging physiology
and rejuvenate muscle bioenergetics and anabolism."

Antibiotic resistance stands as a formidable challenge in both human and veterinary medicine, demanding
comprehensive strategies to monitor and regulate antimicrobial usage. This FDA proposal brings together the
esteemed Food Animal Residue Avoidance Databank (FARAD) and the pioneering data analytics prowess of the
1DATA consortium to confront this urgent issue head-on. With a dual focus, the project aims to (AIM 1) extract
antimicrobial use data for major livestock and poultry species and (AIM 2) extend data collection efforts to
encompass minor species and companion animals. FARAD, a stalwart institution with over four decades of
experience, serves as the bedrock of evidence-based withdrawal recommendations in veterinary practice.
Through a collaborative network spanning prominent veterinary colleges nationwide, FARAD has cultivated
databases and tools to meticulously curate and analyze antimicrobial usage data across diverse animal
demographics. Harnessing FARAD's reservoir of expertise, this project endeavors to birth the Long-term
Antimicrobial Use with AI web-crawler (LAMU-AI), a revolutionary platform poised to bridge existing data
lacunae. LAMU-AI emerges as a beacon of innovation, amalgamating data streams from FARAD's secure case
repository, regulatory bodies, veterinary medical teaching hospitals, and online repositories to furnish real-time
insights into antimicrobial utilization trends. Armed with cutting-edge data analytics, machine learning, artificial
intelligence methodologies, and a large language processing model, LAMU-AI promises scalable and
multifaceted visualization of antimicrobial deployment patterns. This groundbreaking approach empowers
stakeholders—be it veterinarians, producers, regulatory agencies, or researchers—with the ammunition to make
judicious decisions regarding antimicrobial stewardship and public health. Central to this initiative is the
integration of disparate data sources, including FARAD's databases and regulatory testing datasets, to furnish a
complete view of antimicrobial utilization practices. The advent of a sophisticated Big Data Dashboard and
Visualization system promises to democratize the analysis and interpretation of intricate datasets, fostering
collaboration and knowledge propagation across sectors. Furthermore, robust data security protocols will
safeguard the sanctity and confidentiality of sensitive information, assuring stakeholders of the integrity of the
data ecosystem. In summation, this project represents a paradigm shift in veterinary medicine—a concerted
effort to confront critical data lacunae through the fusion of advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence.
By marrying FARAD's unparalleled expertise with the avant-garde technology of the 1DATA consortium, we
aspire not only to redefine antimicrobial surveillance but also to catalyze global endeavors aimed at combating
antibiotic resistance at its core."

Project Summary/Abstract:
Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a leading cause of post-market drug
withdrawal, clinical trial failures, patient fatality, and liver transplantations. It is,
therefore, a serious cause for concern and thus accurate and timely prediction
of DILI is required to assure patient safety during clinical trial. But DILI is a
complex process and human-relevant models, such as organ-chips, are being
considered as tools for DILI prediction. Organ-Chips recreate the complex and
dynamic state in which living cells function in vivo which in turn drives
appropriate cell morphology, function, differentiation, and gene expression.
The Emulate quad-culture Liver-Chip, which consists of primary human
hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, stellate cells, and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells
(LSECs) demonstrated its ability to predict DILI across 18 small molecule drugs
with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 100%. Furthermore, it was able to
differentiate between toxic and non-toxic drugs within the same class. Although
DILI risk needs to be evaluated preclinically for all candidate drugs, it bares
particular importance when the new candidate is in the same class as an
earlier drug that displayed DILI in the clinic. In such cases, there is a higher a
priori risk that the new candidate drug will also display DILI, and so it may
require a higher level of scrutiny by regulators. Accordingly, regulators may
seek data that facilitates the comparison of DILI risk between the new
candidate and prior drug, for example, to build confidence that the new
compound will reduce DILI concerns (and would not, to the contrary, introduce
an even higher liability). The objective of this project is to determine the
suitability of the Liver-Chip to predict DILI risk of a new candidate drug in the
same class as an earlier drug that was a clinical DILI positive. Suitability will be
demonstrated through (inter-lab) reproducibility and (intra-lab) repeatability of
the Liver-Chip as well as performance across a broader panel of human
hepatocyte donors.

Director and Program Coordinator, the Administrative Core executes the mentorship and faculty development plan,
monitors research progress of the Pilot Project Leaders, sets benchmarks, and tracks and assesses the performance of the
research cores. The Steering Committee, chaired by the Program Director and composed of the Program Coordinator,
research core Directors, representative users, top university administrative officials and the chair of the Department of
Business, will ensure continued institutional support for the program, remove institutional barriers that impede the
Center’s success, and participate in strategic planning for the sustainability of the research cores. An External Advisory
Committee of international experts and center directors will provide general programmatic advice to the COBRE Director
and university administrative officials and assesses the progress of Pilot Project Leaders. The Administrative Core will
implement the following Specific Aims. In Aim 1, the Administrative Core will coordinate and execute a faculty
development program for COBRE faculty and Pilot Project Leaders. Organized by the Program Coordinator, this program
will be expanded to include mentor training and a greater emphasis on the needs of faculty at all career stages. In addition
to formal mentors, the faculty development program includes in-person and asynchronous content sessions in areas of
importance for research and academic success. Clear milestones are defined using individual development plans that are
revisited for personal reflection. The major goal of the faculty development program is to navigate faculty successfully
through the promotion/tenure process and to provide a supportive environment for faculty. In Aim 2, the Administrative
Core will oversee strategic planning, fiscal management, compliance, and center evaluation in order to ensure that the
research cores are on track to become sustainable after Phase 3. Compliance with all institutional and NIH regulations will
be verified for research expenditures and will inform the setting of fee structures for core services. The Administrative
Core will conduct annual performance evaluations of the research cores, faculty development program, and Pilot Project
Leaders. In Aim 3, the Administrative Core will administer the pilot project program. New for Phase 3, the pool of pilot
project recipients will be expanded to include faculty in neighboring IDeA program institutions, with particular emphasis
on supporting projects that utilize the research cores and have a high likelihood of leading to independent support.
Projects will undergo a rigorous review process that includes a panel of IDeA program investigators chaired by the
Program Coordinator, followed by a secondary review by the EAC and COBRE Director. Pilot Project Leaders will
receive mentorship and career guidance and will undergo an annual research performance review."
10845668,"The Behavior Core is built on a strong foundation of expertise in the fields of rodent sensory testing, pharmacological and
optogenetic manipulation of neurons, preclinical early-stage drug discovery and development, and genotyping and colony
management. The BC has become a critical resource for both COBRE and non-COBRE-affiliated investigators at the
University of New England (UNE), regional and national academic users, and industry partners. Across Phase 3, the Core
will continue to build on this diverse user base to create a stable and reliable revenue stream with the goal of becoming a
sustainable resource for users requiring high quality in vivo testing. The BC will continue to provide (a) a centralized
space for many behavioral assays and surgical procedures; (b) standardized protocols and training between laboratories to
reduce variability and increase reproducibility and validity of behavioral assays; (c) advanced training and model
development and validation (e.g., alternatives to reflexive nociceptive responses such as affective, cognitive, and pain-
suppressed readouts). New developments include expanded space and equipment for independent testing areas for rats and
mice to increase throughput and diminish potential confounds of testing both species in the same areas, expanded
breeding and genotyping services to support the increased utilization of genetically-modified mouse and rat models, and
support for investigators’ utilization of optogenetic approaches in behavioral studies. Continued training of Core research
staff will be provided to ensure that the highest level of innovation and support can be provided to Behavior Core users.
User feedback from internal and external users has consistently been highly positive. Core personnel have been included
as authors on publications and Behavior Core services have been included in NIH grant submissions. Continued
investments in its capabilities will allow the Core to provide the latest experimental tools in animal research and help the
Core transition to fiscal independence. Noting the value that the COBRE research cores bring to UNE, the institution has
outlined a commitment to support the Behavior Core for at least 5 years beyond the end of the Phase 3 funding period.
Institutional commitments include dedicated laboratory space and shared costs for equipment purchase, maintenance, and
upgrades, a voucher program for Behavior Core use and training, and support of dedicated effort for Core Directors. Such
support will foster the growth and expansion of Behavior Core resources required to maintain the high-quality services
currently appreciated by current users. The Behavior Core Director has worked closely with neighboring COBRE and
INBRE supported research cores at the Maine Medical Research Institute and the Mount Desert Island Biological
Laboratory to coordinate Behavior Core services with other regional research cores. This coordination will allow the
Behavior Core to broaden its user base as it prepares for long-term sustainability."
10845671,"Prior to the initiation of this COBRE, there were no research cores at the University of New England (UNE). Phase 1 and
2 COBRE support resulted in the development of the Histology and Imaging Core (HIC) into a critical resource for
COBRE investigators and the broader research community at UNE and the region. The Core's histology instrumentation
includes tissue embedding equipment, microtomes, vibratomes, cryostats and slide staining workstations. Imaging
equipment includes brightfield, widefield fluorescence, slide-scanning, confocal and 2-photon microscopes. Technical
services include tissue embedding, sectioning, conventional histology stains, immunohistochemistry, and antibody
optimization and validation. In Phase 2, the HIC provided services to 38 investigators (15 UNE-COBRE, 8 UNE-non-
COBRE, 10 in external academia and 5 in industry), and trained 175 laboratory personnel. Also in Phase 2, a fee-for-
service model was initiated, and strong partnerships with other IDeA institutions at Brown University and Maine Medical
Center Research Institute were developed that, in combination with internal users, have the potential to be long-term
sustaining providers of Core income. Special care has been taken to ensure that the Core capabilities do not duplicate
those offered by other COBRE- and INBRE-supported research cores. Instead, the Core has strategically specialized in
unique services such the processing of brain samples, bone samples and marine-derived samples. In Phase 3, the HIC will
maintain its current outstanding level of performance, critically assess its performance, continue to develop its personnel
professionally, and hire an additional technician to keep pace with the needs of its broadening user base. The HIC will
also undertake a rigorous strategic planning program under the direction of a UNE expert in small business strategy, with
the goal of completing its transition to post-award sustainability. The HIC has secured critical additional institutional
support, including guarantees of post-Phase 3 salary for key Core personnel, protected time for Directors, laboratory
space, assistance with maintenance and service contracts, and an internally funded core voucher program and continuation
of the UNE mini-grant program for those striving for extramural support. Through these efforts, the UNE HIC will
continue to provide excellent critical research support to its many users, ensuring maximum utility to UNE and the
broader research community in Phase 3 and beyond."
10845673,"The Pilot Project Program will continue to be a critical component of the COBRE, ensuring the long-term sustainability of
both the Behavior Core and the Histology and Imaging Core. Sustainability of these Cores will require continued internal
use, but also a strong regional user base from academic institutions and industry partners. To accomplish this, the Pilot
Project Program will solicit proposals from research faculty at both UNE and its Northern New England partner
institutions (Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Maine INBRE institutions, and the University of New Hampshire),
increasing the external user base for the Cores. The Pilot Project Program will provide a maximum of 2-years of funding
for early-stage projects to generate preliminary data that have the best chance for obtaining extramural research dollars.
With the solicitation of proposals from outside of UNE, funding priorities for the Pilot Project Program will no longer be
restricted to pain research but will be expanded to include any projects that utilize the COBRE research cores. Awarding

pending or in the process of revision. The Administrative Core will implement the Pilot Project Program through the
following Specific Aims. Aim 1 will solicit, review, and select highly meritorious proposals for funding. Proposals will be
evaluated for their scientific strength (Significance, Innovation, and Approach), as well as investigator and environment
strengths. The scientific review committee will be composed of both experienced and early-stage investigators, chaired by
the COBRE Program Coordinator, mirroring NIH study section procedures. A secondary review of this committee’s
recommendations will be completed by the External Advisory Committee (EAC) and COBRE Director before funding
decisions are made. In Aim 2, the Administrative Core will provide oversight and evaluate the progress of all pilot project
awardees. Pilot Project Leaders will receive a post-award orientation from the COBRE Director, as well as budget support
from the COBRE Program Manager, with projects needing to be in full compliance with all applicable NIH policies.
Scientific progress will be evaluated quarterly by the mentor(s) of the Pilot Project Leader and the Administrative Core,
and annually by the EAC. The Administrative Core in Aim 3 will provide Pilot Project Leaders with career and research
guidance through a faculty development program that utilizes trained, formal mentor(s) for both research and career
guidance, in addition to formal in-person or asynchronous faculty development sessions. As Pilot Project Leaders may be
non-UNE faculty, the Administrative Core will work their home institutions to recruit mentors and ensure that our faculty
development content is congruent with their home institutions."
10845674,"SUMMARY: The Administrative Core is a mandatory core and, as in the past, will assume organizational

Wyoming INBRE Administrative Core are to continue to provide logistical support for the statewide
network comprised of the University of Wyoming as the lead institution and the Wyoming community
colleges as partner institutions, implemented during INBRE 1-3 to meet Wyoming INBRE’s Specific Aims.
The top priorities and major objectives of Wyoming INBRE 3 and the Administrative Core are structured
around the five specific aims of Wyoming INBRE: 1) continue to build on the established multi-
disciplinary research network with scientific foci that will build and strengthen biomedical research
expertise, education, training, and infrastructure at the University of Wyoming and its seven partner
institutions; 2) build and increase the research base and capacity of the University of Wyoming and its
partner institutions by providing research support to faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate
students; 3) provide research opportunities for undergraduate students that will create a pipeline for
undergraduate students to continue in health research careers within IDeA states; 4) enhance the

opportunities across the Western IDeA Region."
10845675,"Bioinformatics Project Summary 
The long-term goal of the Bioinformatics Core (BC) is to develop a robust bioinformatics 
infrastructure that increases the overall research productivity of Wyoming researchers, and 
provides career-enhancing training for Wyoming students. The primary goal of the BC during 
INBRE 4 is to build on successful bioinformatic programs supported by previous INBRE funding 
with a plan that acknowledges the state’s needs and takes into account the unique structure of its 
INBRE network. The BC will pursue the following three objectives to achieve this BC-specific goal, 
as well as the overall Specific Aims of Wyoming INBRE 4: 
1. Support bioinformatics research and education at the University of Wyoming, by enhancing 
and extending successful INBRE 3 programs. 
2. Foster statewide development of bioinformatics skills and capabilities through support for 
research and training at the community colleges and state entities. 
3. Expand the impact of the BC’s work through engagement with regional and national INBRE 
programs and networks. 
 The expected outcomes of the BC include successful collaborative bioinformatics research 
projects, which at the University of Wyoming will generate publications in the peer-reviewed 
literature, and at the community colleges will provide student exposure to bioinformatics 
methodologies. Bioinformatics education will continue to support the transition of research groups 
to being capable of independent bioinformatic analysis. Tangible resources in the form of seed 
grants for data generation, as well as travel grants to acquire specialized bioinformatic training, 
will position Wyoming investigators to compete successfully for extramural research funding. BC 
personnel will also contribute to a burgeoning UW undergraduate curriculum in computational 
biology and data science, through teaching of dedicated bioinformatics courses. Outcomes of 
work with state entities will include continued support in data analysis training as well as an 
internship program to improve workforce development. These project outcomes will have positive 
impact on the ability of Wyoming researchers and educators to use bioinformatic approaches in 
their research, and on career trajectories and workforce development for student and state entity 
trainees. To help achieve these objectives, we propose two improvements in BC organizational 
structure and staffing. The BC Director will be assisted by a new BC Associate Director, and 
addition of a new Bioinformatics Education and Outreach Coordinator to enhance the BC’s ability 
to support community college and UW faculty to add bioinformatics modules into existing courses."

improvement. An ambitious recruitment and retention plan—involving the active participation of all training
faculty—is employed to ensure full participation and inclusion of trainees from underrepresented minority,
disabled, and disadvantaged backgrounds."
10892301,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
My overarching goal is to understand the three-dimensional (3D) enhancer regulation of aging and age-related
diseases. Aging is accompanied by functional decline of tissues and an increased probability of many
diseases. Epigenetic alteration is one hallmark of aging. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that histone
acetylation levels elevate in senescent cells and global remodeling of the enhancer landscape occurs in aging
and senescence. However, there is poor understanding of the influence of three-dimensional (3D) enhancer
regulation changes during senescence. My preliminary data demonstrate that many enhancers connect
together to form large clusters, termed hubs. The enhancers and promoters included in hubs are different
between proliferation and senescence. The senescence-specific hubs ensure critical transcription programs for
senescent phenotypes. However, how enhancer hubs change in response to stress and the mechanisms and
functions of these alterations remain to be elucidated. The main goal of the proposed studies is to uncover
mechanisms underlying the 3D regulation of enhancer hubs under different sources of stress during
aging and age-related disease. I hypothesize that (1) during aging, key enhancers cluster together within
hubs to regulate stress-specific gene expression programs; (2) two enhancer regulatory pathways exist during
normal aging: one is cell intrinsic, and the other is cell extrinsic deriving from environmental inflammatory
signals which accelerate the intrinsic pathway. In the mentored K99 phase (Aim 1), I will study epigenetic
mechanisms regulating 3D enhancer hubs in senescence (Aim 1a) and test their generalization among
different types of senescence (Aim 1b). Completion of these aims will set the stage for my independent
research in aging and age-related metabolic disorder. In the R00 phase (Aim 2), in natural aging in liver,
utilizing a unique mouse model, I will dissect the intrinsic enhancer regulatory pathway in hepatocytes and the
extrinsic pathway stimulated by environmental inflammatory signals. This will provide potential targets to
ameliorate age-related metabolic disorders in future direction of my independent lab. Ultimately, the proposed
research will unveil new mechanisms underlying the interplay between inflammation and enhancer regulation
in aging and provide novel therapeutic targets for age-related diseases. The career development and training
components in K99 phase will expand my experience in aging, metabolism and immunology to provide a rich
foundation for my successful transition to an independent career."

This application requests five additional years for the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Training Grant
in Rheumatology to continue to fulfill its goal of preparing pre- and post-doctoral fellows for careers as
independent investigators in academia, conducting cutting-edge basic and/or translational rheumatology
disease-related research. We are requesting 3 postdoctoral training slots (for MD, MD/PhD, MD/MPH, and/or
PhD researchers in bench laboratory or clinical-translational investigation), and 3 slots for predoctoral students
(for dual MD/PhD and/or single PhD students, all to be trained in basic-translational research in the UCSD/La
Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology (LJI) Biomedical sciences Program in Immunology). The training
program will consist of a research experience typically of 24 months, and up to 36 months.
We re-imagined and re-energized our program by implementing a series of innovations for this renewal
application that allow us to prepare our trainees for the research workforce of tomorrow. Rather than traditional
research approaches, we will embed critical skills like team science, community engagement and
dissemination and implementation science into each trainee project. The 48-participating faculty will build
multi-disciplinary training teams that will include in this cycle a clinical or basic research mentor, one
computational mentor, together with one Rheumatology clinician and one junior mentor-in-training for all trainees.
This will emphasize collaboration, help nurture translational thinking and team science in the trainees, help
access patient cohorts and samples, and develop the mentoring skills of junior faculty. This exposure to “team
science” together with the mandatory coursework will help the trainees learn how to interact with colleagues,
and share in the contributions and credit for interesting research programs. Of important note, to address health
disparities and unmet needs, this program will focus on bi-directional communication between trainees and
the community, will include a community member on the mentor team, will embed interactions with the
community in planning studies and assessing impacts, as well as a Dissemination and Implementation plan.
To promote creation of multi-disciplinary research teams, we have added new well-funded, outstanding primary
mentors, with a strong emphasis on diversity and leaders focused on population science and community
engagement. We have also re-organized our program around 2 major themes integrated with our central focus
on translational rheumatic diseases research that represent strengths in our research community: (1)
Translational Immunology, Joint Biology, Mucosal Immunobiology and Metabiomics, and (2)
Epidemiology, Biomedical Informatics and Computational Biology. We will also emphasize recruiting and
training outstanding independent researchers who help develop evidence-based treatments in routine care and
expand collaboration with our community to improve health dissemination in the community."
10849547,"ABSTRACT: This U01 application aims to (1) develop a robust protoacoustic dosimeter for 3D in vivo dosimetry
in proton FLASH therapy, which is essential for its clinical application and acceptance; (2) form a multi-disciplinary
and multi-institutional research partnership, incorporating both academic and industrial entities, to hasten the
creation and implementation of this innovative dosimeter for clinical usage in the ensuing 5-10 years.
More than half of cancer patients receive radiation therapy (RT) in their treatment journey. The recent RT method,
FLASH, using an ultra-high dose rate, is noted for its ability to minimize normal tissue damage while maintaining
tumor control. Proton therapy is emerging as a promising delivery method for FLASH. Ensuring the precision of
proton FLASH delivery is critical given the high risks of such treatments. Errors in ultra-fast delivery can significantly
affect dose delivery to the tumor and healthy tissues. As a result, there's an urgent need for a 3D in vivo dosimeter
for validation and guidance of the actual dose delivered by FLASH. This necessity stems from the fact that current
dosimeters can't handle the ultra-high dose rate in FLASH or lack in vivo volumetric data. Thus, developing 3D in
vivo dosimetry is key for the precise delivery of proton FLASH RT.
Our proposal involves the creation of a novel Protoacoustic/Ultrasound Dual-modality Imaging System (PUDIS)
to meet this pressing need. PUDIS uses protoacoustic imaging for dosimetry validation, and we are pioneers in
exploring radiation-induced acoustic imaging for radiation dosimetry. Recently, we've shown the potential of using
protoacoustic signals for in vivo dosimetry of a single proton pulse. However, more work is needed to explore this
technology under FLASH dose rate and significantly enhance the image quality for precise 3D dosimetry.
We aim to accomplish this through the following objectives: Aim 1: Characterize the basis of protoacoustic imaging
as a FLASH dosimeter on human-size phantom. Aim 2: Develop a robust protoacoustic/ultrasound dual-modality
imaging system (PUDIS) for dosimetry/anatomy verification on animal models in vivo. Aim 3: Establish PUDIS as
a quantitative 3D dosimetry system for FLASH therapy.
Outcome/Impact: This grant will result in a rigorously vetted PUDIS prototype, marking the first introduction of 3D
in vivo dosimetry to proton FLASH RT. Backed by a team of cross-institutional academic and industry experts, we
anticipate a successful project. PUDIS's in vivo 3D dose verification will catalyze precise proton FLASH RT,
unlocking FLASH's full potential. This accelerates research, application, and acceptance of this treatment,
ultimately benefiting cancer patients vulnerable to RT-related toxicities."

This is a proposal to support the ENgaging Leaders In Global and local HealTh Equity in Neurology
(ENLIGHTEN) training program. The goal of ENLIGHTEN is to prepare clinician researchers and PhD
scientists to become leaders in neurologic health equity research aimed at reducing the gap in neurologic
health and access to healthcare for neurologic disorders in the US and globally. As knowledge about health
disparities and their adverse effects on health outcomes expands, the research environment has shifted to
focus not only on identifying disparities but also on developing effective and sustainable solutions to reduce
disparities and improve outcomes among patients with neurologic conditions. This rapidly changing landscape
requires training in skills needed to translate scientific findings into evidence-based interventions on a
community and population health level, including for the most underserved and vulnerable populations.
ENLIGHTEN is supported by the superb interdisciplinary research and training environment of the UCSF
Department of Neurology, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Clinical Translational Science
Institute, Center for Vulnerable Populations, Global Brain Health Institute, and Institute for Global Health
Sciences. This robust infrastructure combined with a multitude of mentors with expertise in global neurology
and neurologic health equity make UCSF the ideal home for ENLIGHTEN. We propose a highly unique
program structure, with 10 faculty at UCSF and over half of our mentors outside of UCSF, including 9 faculty at
other US institutions, of which 2 are located at historically black colleges and universities, and 4 faculty at our
low- and middle-income partner sites. By harnessing nationally and globally dispersed expertise into a shared
intellectual space, ENLIGHTEN will provide a forum for a carefully selected core group of exemplary mentors
to engage in the scientific education and career development of a small cohort of highly motivated trainees
positioned to become future leaders in neurologic health equity.
We request support for two postdoctoral MD or PhD trainees selected annually for this stimulating two-year
training program, which aims to develop a capable health equity workforce committed to careers in
neurological research. At the core of ENLIGHTEN’s training model is hands-on research experience in
neurologic health equity with one-on-one guidance from a primary mentor and mentoring team integrated with
coursework in health equity topics (e.g., population health, social and environmental determinants of health,
implementation science, community-engaged research) and applied training in quantitative literacy, rigor, and
reproducibility tailored to the prior training, proposed research, and career plans of trainees. Through this
multipronged educational program, trainees will gain the advanced skills and rich experience needed to design,
implement, and analyze rigorous research studies; disseminate their results; and transition to research
independence."

Health and health behavior depend crucially on social networks. Both the spread of
communicable diseases, such as HIV, and the diffusion of beliefs and practices that shape
health behavior, such as dietary risk behavior, can be understood as network-generated health
processes, operating over (sometimes very complex and dynamic) social networks. This
recognition is evidenced by the dramatic growth in social network and health studies in the last
30 years. Despite the clear demand and recognition of health importance, network methods are
rarely covered in the standard social-science methods sequences for health and health-policy
scholars. The first phase of the Social Networks & Health (SN&H) scholars R25 focused on an
intensive introduction that favored breadth over depth and investing directly in fellows’ research-
ready projects to help spur innovative health research. This approach has been successful, with
high participant satisfaction and demand for the training outpacing openings every year.
Although the basics course sequence is in high demand, our Fellows and alumni have
continuously expressed interest in more in-depth, advanced methods training. As such, for this
renewal we propose to expand on this intensive introduction by offering two types of workshops
in alternating years: we’ll continue the intensive intro in odd years (program years 5, 7, 9) but
offer an advanced methods sequence in even years (6, 8, 10). The advanced training will focus
on the estimation and implementation nuances of base methods, covering causal inference in
peer effects (including experiments), complex data collection, advanced network inductive
techniques (communities and roles), simulation and computational modeling, and dynamic
statistical modeling. The target audience will be people who have started network analysis
related projects or who have participated in our earlier workshops. By providing advanced
training, we can propel the community of social networks and health scholars past novice work
and empower them to be able to train and mentor others. The new set of courses will also
expand our online resources with new code, video lectures, and instructional materials. This
program will provide participants with the skills and resources needed to move research from
inchoate ideas to practical, well-reasoned and generative social networks and health research
at the cutting edge of contemporary network science."

GC cases. The etiology of GA has been described as a histopathological progression from atrophic gastritis,

Metaplasia (SPEM), which is associated with human GA as a pre-neoplasia. Extensive studies have established
H. pylori as a major environmental risk factor for GC and ~1% of infected cases are linked to GC. The role of
host factors for GC are also indicated by accumulating evidence. As in other diseases, rare cases of genetic
mutations can offer novel insights that may be broadly relevant. Indeed, gastritis and GC development in
recently-identified rare cases of human CTLA4 haplo-insufficiency highlight the potential of chronic inflammation
in GC. A recent survey of 133 patients with CTLA4 haplo-insufficiency from ~2-50 years of age found atrophic
gastritis in 9% of the patients and GC in 3% of the patients. The finding from these rare cases also consists with
evidence for an association of human GA with a genetic predisposed CTLA4 insufficiency due to gene
polymorphisms. We recently reported a transgenic CTLA4 RNAi “knockdown” (CTLA4KD) model for GC initiated
by CTLA4 insufficiency. On susceptible genetic backgrounds, CTLA4KD mice exhibited spontaneous
development of SPEM with 100% penetrance, even in germ-free conditions. Corroborating the genetic evidence,
CTLA4 blockade with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) also induced SPEM in mice. With age, SPEM progressed
to GA in all CTLA4KD mice. Thus, CTLA4KD mice not only model human GC initiated by CTLA4 insufficiency,
but also capture a shared feature of SPEM and GA progression with an entire cascade from gastritis, metaplasia
to invasive adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, the CTLA4KD model illustrated a critical role of autoimmunity in GC.
Autoimmunity has been suggested to be the cause of the recently identified rise of noncardia GC in Americans
who are less than 50 year old, especially non-Hispanic white women. Overall, our preliminary data suggest that
the causality of CTLA4 insufficiency in GC was due to a type of inflammatory “crosstalk” between immune and
epithelial cells. We hypothesize that type 2 inflammation initiates metaplastic differentiation of gastric epithelia
and drives malignant transformation of the pre-neoplastic lineage into invasive adenocarcinoma. Specifically, we
will: 1) determine the subtypes of immune cells that cause aberrant epithelial-immune interaction in mucosae
leading to metaplastic differentiation and malignant transformation; 2) examine the origin and fate of pre-
neoplastic cell differentiation mediated by epithelial-intrinsic signaling of type 2 cytokine receptors; 3) identify the
growth factors in type 2 inflammatory niches that propel the proliferation and transformation of epithelial lineages
in the stomach. The study will reveal the origin and fate of pre-malignant cells, and help a long-term goal to
identify potential biomarkers and targets to break the link between inflammation and tumorigenesis."

While many children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are cured with frontline therapy,
for those who experience relapse, outcomes remain suboptimal. I am a pediatric oncologist
specializing in the care of children, adolescents, and young adults with high-risk and relapsed
leukemias with a research focus on clinical trials of novel therapies in both the relapsed and
frontline settings. My clinical research efforts are conducted primarily through collaborative
studies that are made possible by the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN), specifically the
Children’s Oncology Group (COG), where I am currently spearheading the pediatric
development of inotuzumab ozogamicin as the Study Chair or Co-Chair of two large COG ALL
trials, am a member of the COG Relapsed ALL Steering Committee, and am the Vice-Chair of
the APAL2020SC screening trial for molecular characterization of relapsed leukemias with
allocation to targeted clinical trials. Beginning in October 2023, I will serve as the COG ALL
Committee Vice-Chair for Precision Medicine/Relapse. My research interests include improving
our understanding of the toxicities of novel agents, identifying patients at highest risk for side
effects and devising optimal management approaches for diverse patient populations based on
clinical features, leukemia biology, and pharmacogenomic factors. In this era of multiple novel
agents with activity in ALL including bidirectional antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, chimeric
antigen receptor T-cell therapy, and targeted agents including kinase inhibitors and modulators
of apoptosis, the development of well-designed and efficient clinical trials to determine how to
incorporate these agents for different populations will be critical to moving the field of ALL
therapy forward over the next decade. Locally, I serve as the Medical Director of the
Leukemia/Lymphoma Program at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center with a focus on
pilot studies of novel agents that, if promising, can be further developed in COG. The long-term
objective of this application is to support the time needed over the next five years to complete
the active COG inotuzumab ozogamicin trials (NCT03959085, NCT02981626) and to lead
development of the COG portfolio of trials for both newly diagnosed and relapsed ALL."

ABSTRACT
High-throughput genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and immune profiling technologies now provide a wealth of
data that can be mined to interrogate basic biological process, changes in cellular or organismal populations,
and the molecular bases of disease—at levels ranging from the whole organism to single cells. The generation
and analysis of such data is now a pillar of research approaches and problems in the life sciences. The Center
for Quantitative Biology (CQB) has established a vibrant research program, uniting “wet bench” researchers
focused on pressing problems in human heath, with computational scientists providing rigorous analysis,
methods development, and insight to these data. Single-Cell Genomics (SCG) and spatial transcriptomics have
become essential tools to understand diseases involving complex biological systems including cancer,
neurodegenerative, and immune/autoimmune diseases. Phase 1 of this COBRE established the SCG Core, a
centralized resource within the CQB providing access to cutting-edge instrumentation and expertise in single-
cell and spatial -omics technologies to project leaders and researchers across the Dartmouth research
community and regional IDeA institutions. The SCG Core has had a substantial impact on science conducted by
CQB project leads and other Dartmouth investigators, processing over 600 samples, publishing 18 manuscripts
and helping to secure 5 grants totaling more than $11 million. Working closely with COBRE leadership and its
users, the SCG Core has implemented end-to-end workflow support for sample collection, tissue processing and
quality control within a digital sample tracking framework (Aim 1), and performs cell isolation, library preparation,
and sequencing for a comprehensive suite of single-cell workflows (Aim 2). In Phase 2, the SCG Core will build
upon current efforts to provide spatial transcriptomics services through close integrations with histology, imaging,
and pathology resources at Dartmouth, building the infrastructure required for translational science (Aim 3).
Through collaboration with the Genomic Data Science Core (GDSC), users will have access to analysis
workflows complementary to the offerings provided by the SCG Core, ensuring the large amounts of complex
data generated by these methods can be readily interpreted to gain biological insight and inform subsequent
experiments in a timely manner. As leaders in the field of single-cell genomics, members of the SCG Core will
also serve as key opinion leaders for industry and academic partners and engage with the scientific community
through regional and national meetings. As part of a network of experts in the field, the SCG Core will stay
abreast of the latest technologies and learn from the experience of others to implement high-quality services for
its users."
10852859,"In spite of the serious threats of intentional or accidental exposures to radiation, molecular mechanisms of injury after
total body irradiation (TBI) are not completely clear, hence radiomitigative approaches remain insufficient. Our
discoveries of oxygenated cardiolipins (CLs) as required stages of TBI apoptosis have already resulted in
mitochondria-targeted GS-nitroxides and imidazole-substituted fatty acids as anti-apoptotic radiomitigators. Similarly,
deciphering the TBI ferroptotic signaling by hydroperoxy-phosphatidylethanolamines (HOO-PEs) produced by 15-
lipoxygenases (15LOX) complexes with phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (15-LOX/PEBP1) guides us to
new inhibitors as novel radiomitigators. Our demonstration of “theft- ferroptosis” by a bacterial pathogen,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, utilizing its 15-LOX (pLoxA) (12) to trigger ferroptosis of the host (epithelial) cells indicates
that TBI induced non-sterile inflammation may be also therapeutically targeted. Our central hypothesis is that radiation
triggered responses engage several types of programmed necrotic death, particularly ferroptosis, in GI epithelial cells
and the major innate immune cells, neutrophils and macrophages, evolving over time and driving necro-inflammatory
vs pro-resolving apoptotic responses during sterile and non-sterile inflammation and culminating in multiple organ
dysfunction and mortality. This sets the stage for a principally new understanding of the TBI mechanisms and leads to
a new harmonized radiomitigation strategy of time- and mechanism-specific targeting of the leading cell death
pathways. Our hypothesis will be tested as follows: Aim 1: By employing Redox Lipidomics identify specific
oxygenated phospholipid signatures of the major death programs in epithelial cells, neutrophils and macrophages of
the GI of irradiated mice at different stages of sterile and non-sterile necro-inflammation. These newly discovered TBI
lipid biomarkers will be related to: i) specific protein markers of cell death, ii) major pro- and anti-inflammatory lipid
mediators, iii) cytokines, and iv) breach of the epithelial barrier and immunosuppression. Aim 2: Explore molecular
mechanisms of sensitivity/resistance to ferroptosis of macrophages and neutrophils polarized to M1 (N1) and M2 (N2)
states in response to pro-/anti-inflammatory conditions and expression of 15LOX and iNOS/NO• system in vitro and
TBI induced ferroptosis in vivo. We will employ 15LOX and iNOS KO mice and also quantitatively assess the role of
P. aeruginosa and its pLoxA in gut ferroptosis and radiosensitivity of mice to TBI. Aim 3: Design new selective
inhibitors of pro-ferroptotic catalytic activity of mammalian 15LOX as well as prokaryotic pLoxA of P. aeruginosa and
test them as anti-ferroptotic radiomitigators during sterile and non-sterile stages of TBI radiation disease. Overall, this
project is based on an entirely new concept that abandons the search for a single “silver-bullet” radiomitigator and
includes a harmonized combination of several mitigators controlling TBI triggered aberrant reactions in time- and
mechanism-dependent manner."
10852861,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiac fibrosis is the pathologic development of scar tissue around the muscle cells of the heart. It
occurs with nearly every form of heart disease and rapidly progresses the heart to failure. A fundamental
cellular determinant of fibrosis is the transition of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which are the primary
producers of fibrotic matrix. Notably, myofibroblast revert to quiescence as organs including the heart
recover from some injuries and fibrosis resolves. New evidence from liver and skin suggests these
deactivated myofibroblasts are primed to reactivate with enhanced fibrotic responsiveness and wound
healing capabilities as a protective adaptation to future injury. This has never been examined in the heart,
but our preliminary data suggests cardiac fibrosis more than doubles when recovered hearts experience
a second bout of pathologic stress. Given heart disease develops from cumulative rounds of stress and
recovery, cardiac myofibroblasts likely undergo multiple cycles of deactivation and reactivation providing
impetus for delineating these processes and determining how they are regulated. Our previous work
suggests that p38 MAPK regulates the stability of the myofibroblast phenotype and the heart's fibrotic
response. Moreover, recent findings suggest p38 inhibition appears to deactivate myofibroblasts
reverting them to quiescence. This finding suggests that we can use experimental p38 perturbations of
the myofibroblast state to study its impact on the heart's fibrotic response. Hence two comprehensive
specific aims will be used to examine the overarching hypothesis that p38 regulation of myofibroblast
state stability and the kinetics and fate trajectory of deactivation underlies long-term fibrotic
responsiveness of the heart. Here single cell RNA sequencing in combination with myofibroblast lineage
reporter mice engineered with targeted gain or loss of p38 function will be used to determine: (Aim 1) the
role of p38 in regulating myofibroblast deactivation and resolving cardiac fibrosis, and (Aim 2) the effects
of p38 activity on deactivated cardiac myofibroblast reactivation, fibrotic responsiveness, and fibrotic
memory. Together these aims will attempt (A) to define the process and regulation of cardiac
myofibroblast deactivation and reactivation, (B) to identify compensatory responses to perturbations in
myofibroblast activity, and (C) to identify the function of deactivated myofibroblasts, their epigenetic
memories of injury, and their role in enhancing the heart's fibrotic responsiveness."

aging research. We will provide these trainees with the skills and experience to pursue advanced
MSTEM degrees and research careers in aging by providing research training, education, career
development, mentoring, and peer socialization activities that emphasize integration between
geroscience and health disparities research. Our program is designed to overcome longstanding
financial, social support, and cultural barriers that have limited opportunities for diverse

professionalization opportunity over the entire four-year undergraduate experience. We will target
recruitment of underrepresented minority students from the USC student population, from
underrepresented minority serving 2-year and 4-year colleges, and from the local K-12 schools in
the greater LAUSD. GEMSTEM will create an undergraduate-centered geroscience research
community modeled for sustained program enhancement by the continuous assessment of
programmatic components by students, expert geroscience faculty, and professional staff.
 The goals of the GEMSTEM program are to (1) expand research access to emerging
undergraduate researchers from racial and ethnic minority and other health disparity populations
and (2) increase the number of researchers conducting gerontological research to reduce health
disparities in older adult populations. GEMSTEM aims include: (1) recruit a diverse group of
USC undergraduate students from Gerontology and other MSTEM degree programs, over the
entire undergraduate experience, to participate in GEMSTEM; (2) engage student participation
in active research on aging and introduce them to diversity in aging research through socialization
and engagement activities that will build passion for and commitment to a disparities-informed
geroscience; (3) facilitate structured education and research training opportunities in aging;
provide sustained mentorship; and prepare program participants for future success in graduate
and medical school research training and careers; and (4) create a community GEMSTEM

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI’s) represent a paradigm shift in cancer care, leveraging the immune system
to target cancer cells. In animal and basic studies, these pathways (PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4) are also critical
negative regulators of atherosclerosis and blockade of PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4 in animal studies activates T
cells leading to T cell infiltration and increased atherosclerosis. We provide retrospective clinical and imaging
data to support our hypothesis that ICI’s will increase coronary atherosclerosis in a prospective study. We will
test this hypothesis by performing a prospective observational coronary CTA study, where 135 patients (initially
enrolling 300) with melanoma, with and without the BRAF mutation (2:1 ratio, ICI/BRAF), will undergo serial
coronary CTA at baseline, 12 months (sub-group) and 2 years. Patients with melanoma with a BRAF mutation
receive BRAF inhibitors and will act as the control group, while BRAF negative patients are treated with an ICI.
In Aim 2, based on prior work, we will test whether pre-specified plausible biological factors with established
associations with plaque progression (e.g. PD-1, PD-L1, sCD163, sCD14, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-1b) mediate the
accelerated atherosclerosis with ICI’s. For example, lower PD-1 and PD-L1 levels associate with higher
coronary atherosclerotic plaque where both PD-1 and PD-L1 suppress T cell–driven inflammation in plaques
and plaque progression. In Aim 3, we will perform unbiased exploratory analyses applying single-cell RNA
technologies to systematically decipher the immune cells that contribute. In patients, not on an ICI, specific T
cell subsets have been linked to atherosclerosis and, in preliminary data, we show activation of specific T cells
(CD8+) with other ICI toxicities. The use of ICI’s has increased and continues to rapidly expand. It is estimated
that 36% of cancer patients are currently eligible for an ICI and the number of active clinical trials leveraging
ICIs is extraordinary. Therefore, there is an urgent need to test in a clinical study whether ICI’s lead to
accelerated coronary atherosclerosis and to provide insight into the mechanisms involved."
10853009,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rhabdoid tumors are rare and aggressive pediatric cancers with high rates of mortality and few treatment
options. Most children diagnosed with rhabdoid tumors will die within 18 months of diagnosis, often after
grueling treatment regimens that involve combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. The
molecular basis of rhabdoid tumors is remarkably simple, and involves loss of a single tumor suppressor—
SMARCB1—which encodes the SNF5 component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler. Identification of
SNF5 loss as the driver of rhabdoid tumors was a major breakthrough in understanding the disease, but
raises the question of how the absence of SNF5 promotes tumorigenic programs and whether there are
actionable targets for therapeutic intervention in these cancers. The premise of this project is that loss of
SNF5 causes rhabdoid tumors, at least in part, by activating c-MYC, an oncoprotein transcription factor with
extensive ties to cancer. Supporting this premise are preliminary data showing: (i) an extensive overlap
between the primary transcriptional effects of MYC inhibition and SNF5 re-introduction in rhabdoid tumor
cells, (ii) physical interactions between MYC and SWI/SNF components that are blocked by SNF5, (iii) the
ability of SNF5 to separately inhibit DNA binding by MYC, (iv) MYC-dependent recruitment of a core SWI/
SNF component to chromatin in rhabdoid tumor cells, and (v) an essential role for MYC in rhabdoid tumor
cell survival and transformation. Together, these data explain the recurrent presence of MYC target gene
signatures in rhabdoid tumor patients, and support a model in which loss of SNF5 stimulates a productive
interaction of MYC on chromatin with 'residual' SWI/SNF complexes—which in turn drives key tumorigenic
transcriptional programs in these malignancies. The goal of this project is to characterize the MYC–SWI/
SNF connection in rhabdoid tumor cells, and determine its role in sculpting the rhabdoid transcriptome.
Specific Aim 1 will use a combination of biochemical, genetic, and genomic approaches to define
components of the MYC–SWI/SNF complex and to characterize their recruitment to sites across the
rhabdoid genome. Specific Aim 2 will combine high resolution transcriptomic analyses with cell-based
assays to reveal primary transcriptional events that are controlled via the MYC–SWI/SNF interaction in
rhabdoid tumor cells and to decipher the underlying mechanisms. Completion of these studies will
rigorously challenge the idea that MYC is a defacto driver of oncogenic transcriptional processes in these
cancers. These studies will also expose whether MYC inhibitors are likely to be an effective therapeutic
option in rhabdoid cancers, and will establish a paradigm for how tumor-associated mutations in SWI/SNF—
which occur in 20% of all cancers—intersect with classic oncogenic pathways to drive malignancy."

 This K23 application aims to support Dr. Lisa Anderson to achieve her overarching goal of establishing an
independent, patient-oriented research career that will (a) elucidate biological and psychological mechanisms
associated with risk and maintenance of eating disorders, and (b) use this information to develop and optimize
precise, efficacious treatments for eating disorders. The proposed application will strengthen Dr. Anderson’s
abilities to meet her career goals by providing advanced training designed to: (a) develop expertise in theory
and assessment of disgust conditioning mechanisms involved in transdiagnostic models psychopathology
characterized by avoidance behaviors, and to translate this knowledge to research for eating disorders; (b)
gain knowledge and skills in neuroimaging methods necessary to conduct independent research investigating
the neural substrates of disordered eating; and (c) obtain advanced training in analysis of neuroimaging (fMRI)
data required to independently examine maintenance mechanisms underlying eating disorders across various
units of measurement (i.e., psychological-, behavioral-, physiological-, and neurobiological-level variables). Dr.
Anderson has assembled a team of experts who will provide training to accomplish the proposed training goals
and scientific aims. The core mentorship team consists of Dr. Scott Crow (training in translational eating
disorders research), Dr. Kathryn Cullen (neuroimaging training), Dr. Mark Fiecas (biostatistics), Dr. Shmuel
Lissek (cross-diagnostic models of disgust learning), and Dr. Thomas Hildebrandt (translation of disgust
learning models to eating disorders, computational modeling of aversive reinforcement learning in anorexia
nervosa [AN]). Dr. Kelvin Lim will consult on neuroimaging study design and R01 application preparations. Dr.
Carol Peterson will consult on emotion regulation models and emotion-based mechanisms research for eating
disorders. Dr. Josh Cisler will consult on disgust-based task design and computational models of aversive
reinforcement learning. As part of her training, Dr. Anderson will complete a two-part study. Study 1a will
compare patterns in neural activation during a food-specific disgust generalization and extinction task between
individuals with AN and non-eating-disorder comparison participants to establish the extent to which the neural
substrates of food-specific disgust generalization and extinction specifically relate to food avoidance and
restrictive eating severity in AN. In a longitudinal arm, Study 1b will determine the extent to which neural
activation patterns associated with disgust generalization and extinction predict later AN maintenance. Overall,
in addition to supporting Dr. Anderson’s training goals, this project will meet a critical need by identifying
disgust conditioning mechanisms that may underlie food avoidance symptom severity and disorder
maintenance in AN. This knowledge will ultimately inform the development of novel biological treatments (e.g.,
psychopharmacology, neuromodulation) and optimization of psychological interventions (e.g., reinforcement-
based psychotherapies) that promote long-term recovery from this persistent psychiatric disorder."

The central goal of the University of Kansas’ multidisciplinary Maximizing Access to Research Careers program
(KU MARC) is to provide research, academic, and professional development training to students from groups
underrepresented in the biomedical sciences. The program will have a special emphasis on American Indian
(AI) students. All participant students will be well prepared to thrive in competitive PhD programs and assume
leadership roles in subsequent biomedical research careers. The geographic and demographic context in which
KU is situated provides many unique opportunities and challenges for this training program. KU is a premier
research institution, an AAU member, and classified by the Carnegie Foundation as a “Doctoral University: Very
High Research Activity”. Given its suburban/rural location, KU is a predominantly majority-serving institution.
However, KU’s recruitment and retention efforts to increase diversity are paying dividends, and 45% of
undergraduates in KU MARC-participating programs are MARC-eligible, providing a robust applicant pool.
Moreover, KU is fortunate to have a long-standing relationship with nearby Haskell Indian Nations University,
including a co-sponsored Bridges to the Baccalaureate Program. KU MARC is well-positioned to recruit and train
AI students, who are severely underrepresented in the sciences, through its research and professional
development training as well as its tuition support for students transferring from Haskell to KU. KU MARC’s
programmatic activities are focused both on scholars’ development as scientists and on building an inclusive
community that can provide support as MARC scholars navigate the many challenges inherent to being
underrepresented in their fields. Key activities will include 1) a Pre-MARC program, where potential MARC
scholars will be mentored by current scholars and will explore biomedical research and career opportunities; 2)
Individual Development Plans to guide scholars’ research, academic, and professional activities; and 3)
comprehensive research experiences (10-15 hrs/wk during the academic year; 40 hrs/wk in summer, including
a required off-campus research experience) under the guidance of a KU faculty mentor. Research experiences
will be focused on cultivating scholars’ ability to develop hypotheses, design rigorous and unbiased experiments,
analyze and interpret results, and disseminate findings widely. Key activities also include 4) responsible conduct
of research and rigor and reproducibility training; 5) coursework including scientific writing, quantitative/analytical
methods, and how to prepare competitive graduate school applications; 6) matching of new MARC scholars with

10853018,"Quantitative image features (QIFs) such as radiomic and deep features hold enormous potential to improve the
detection, diagnosis, and treatment assessment of a wide range of diseases. Generated from clinically acquired
Computed Tomography (CT) scans, QIFs represent small pixel-wise changes that may be early indicators of
disease progression. However, detecting these changes is complicated by variations in how CT scans are
acquired and reconstructed. Ensuring repeatable and reproducible QIFs is necessary for developing predictive
models that achieve consistent performance across different clinical settings. This project's premise is that QIFs
are sensitive to CT parameters such as radiation dose level, slice thickness, reconstruction kernel, and
reconstruction method. The combined interactions among these parameters result in unique image conditions,
each yielding its own QIF value. Moreover, some clinical tasks and algorithms are more sensitive to differences
in QIF values than others. We hypothesize that a systematic, task-dependent framework to characterize the
impact of variability in CT parameters and effectively mitigate them will result in more consistent QIF values and
the performance of prediction models. Three interrelated innovations will be pursued in this work: 1) a novel
framework for characterizing the impact of different acquisition and reconstruction parameters on QIFs
and ML models using patient scans with known clinical outcomes in multiple domains; 2) a systematic
approach for selecting an optimal mitigation technique and evaluating the impact of normalization; and
3) an open-source software toolkit that formalizes the process of CT normalization, addressing real-
world use cases developed by academic and industry collaborators. In Aim 1, we will evaluate how multiple
CT parameters influence QIF values and model performance. Utilizing metrics of agreement and a heat map-
based visualization, we will determine under which image acquisition and reconstruction conditions the QIFs and
model performance are consistent. In Aim 2, we will assess and enhance normalization techniques for mitigating
the impact of differences in acquisition and reconstruction, targeting the set of imaging conditions that are most
relevant to a clinical task. In Aim 3, we will engage a spectrum of external stakeholders to guide the development
and adoption of a software toolkit called CT-NORM. Three distinct clinical domains will drive our efforts: lung
nodule detection (which relies on identifying small regions of high contrast differences to identify nodules),
interstitial lung disease quantification (which depends on characterizing texture differences), and ischemic core
assessment (which relies on detecting low contrast differences in brain tissue). CT-NORM will provide the
scientific community with an approach and a unified toolkit to characterize and mitigate the impact of
reconstruction and acquisition parameters on QIFs and prediction model performance. By addressing critical
sources of variability, we will improve the process of generating QIFs and facilitate the discovery of precise and
reproducible imaging phenotypes of disease."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder caused by interactions among multiple
genetic and environmental factors. The strongest genetic factor of AD is apolipoprotein (APO) E genotype—
APOE4 increases AD risk and lowers age-onset of AD and APOE4 carriers account for ~60% of all AD cases;
the remaining ~40% are APOE3 carriers. The genetic complexity and multifactorial nature of Alzheimer’s disease
pose unique challenges for traditional drug development that usually targets a specific gene, protein, or pathway.
For the past several decades, new drug development efforts to target specific AD-related proteins or pathways
have shown promise in animal studies, only to fail during human trials. Since the process of developing new
drugs for Alzheimer’s disease is complicated, time-consuming, and costly, there is a pressing need to consider
unconventional drug development strategies, such as repurposing drugs currently approved for other conditions.
 The approach of drug repurposing has a number of advantages over the development of new drugs and has
been used successfully for various disease conditions. The established safety and tolerability of approved drugs
can lower the burdensome financial thresholds associated with screening, dose optimization, toxicology,
formulation, and manufacturing development. Repurposing approved drugs can also drastically shorten the time
for a drug to reach patients. The recent convergence of two factors presents an unprecedented opportunity to
advance rational drug repurposing. First is the availability of public databases from large-scale genomic,
transcriptomic, and other molecular profiling studies for major diseases in humans. Second is the development
of computational approaches and algorithms as well as the network concept of drug targets, which allows us to
investigate the ability of a therapeutic agent to perturb entire molecular networks away from disease states.
 Many therapeutic areas including cancer have benefited from repurposing existing drugs based on the
network concept of drug targets. Drug repurposing for central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including
Alzheimer’s disease, started recently, with limited success so far, including our recent repurposing of bumetanide
for treating APOE4-related Alzheimer’s disease. A major challenge of drug repurposing for CNS diseases,
including Alzheimer’s disease, is the lack of whole genome gene expression perturbation databases of approved
drugs in human cell types relevant to CNS diseases, including AD.
 This proposal aims to address this major bottleneck for CNS disease drug repurposing, focusing on AD drug
repurposing, by establishing APOE-genotype-dependent and human CNS cell-type-specific Connectivity Maps
(hCNS-CMAPs) covering ~12,000 drugs demonstrated safety in humans, using human iPSC-derived CNS cells
(Aim 1). We will then apply these hCNS-CMAPs for AD drug repurposing and validate the identified top drugs in
a novel mouse model of AD (Aim 2). The outcomes of this project will provide the research and drug development
fields with invaluable resources for repurposing the approved drugs toward AD and other CNS diseases."

CT imaging is one of the primary diagnostic tools utilized in modern radiology departments, and its importance
to modern medicine cannot be overstated. In recent years, spectral CT technologies have been developed to
address one of the long-standing technical limitations associated with conventional single-kV CT imaging:
anatomical structures with different material compositions may have the same CT number for a given acquisition.
Current spectral CT imaging systems have been implemented using advanced x-ray source and/or detector
technologies that enable image objects to be rapidly scanned using two distinct x-ray spectra. However, these
hardware-based spectral CT systems are not without their own intrinsic limitations. Such limitations include a
reduced field-of-view, slower scan speeds, misregistration between the high kV and low kV measurements in
dual source systems, lack of tube current modulation for many fast kV-switching systems, and having other
clinical workflow/efficiency challenges. In this application, we propose to implement and translate a novel single-
kV spectral CT imaging method for abdominal CT applications that overcomes the limitations associated with
current spectral CT imaging methods. With this new method, all conventional contrast-enhanced single-kV
abdominal CT exams can be used to generate a deluxe series of CT images with the desired spectral CT
functionalities including virtual non-contrast CT images, virtual mono-energetic CT images, and quantitative
material basis images (i.e., one-stop-shop). This new method enables an integrated clinical workflow to improve
clinical diagnostic accuracy while reducing both radiation dose and contrast dose to patients, all while reducing
overall healthcare costs. Three specific aims will be carried out to accomplish the overarching objective of this
project: 1) Implement and optimize techniques to achieve one-stop-shop single-kV spectral CT imaging for
abdominal applications; 2) Validate the proposed one-stop-shop single-kV spectral CT imaging method using
the hardware based spectral CT imaging methods; and 3) translate the one-stop-shop single-kV spectral CT
imaging method to the clinical environment for clinical performance evaluations. Upon the completion of this
project, a unique one-stop-shop CT imaging paradigm will have been implemented and translated to clinical
abdominal CT exams to enable one-stop-shop abdominal CT diagnoses with just a single-kV contrast-enhanced
CT acquisition. This new technique can be made available to all types of imaging facilities including community
hospitals or clinics in developing nations, which is in stark contrast to hardware dual-energy CT and photon
counting CT imaging which has been traditionally reserved to high profile academic medical centers that can
afford the latest technological platforms."

10844150,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the United States, the prevalence of opioid use and opioid use disorder (OUD) more than doubled in recent
years. There has been an increase in opioid-related overdose deaths with nearly 92,000 reported in 2020. This
has led to an unprecedented current crisis of OUD and overdose deaths resulting from indiscriminate use of
opiates. While opioids are potent analgesics and provide relief from pain, they are also prone to be addictive.
This crisis is further worsened due to the availability of illicit and more potent synthetic opiates like Fentanyl.
The current FDA-approved drugs for OUD are both inadequate and have adverse effects. Therefore novel
mechanism-based drug discovery approaches are urgently required for OUD and also to prevent overdose
deaths resulting from respiratory depression.
 The heritability of substance use disorder is estimated to be greater than 50% based on twin, family, and
adoption studies, and yet few modulating genes have been evaluated. Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) signaling is
the major pathway responsible for both pain relief and euphoric effects of opioids. It is important to note that
morphine inhibits nuclear translocation of TFEB, a master regulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP),
thereby reducing autophagic activity. Interestingly, we also found that MOR is colocalized with TFEB in the
subcellular neuronal membranes, and most importantly also physically interact with each other as shown by
coimmunoprecipitations. Also, opioids induce significant damage to neurons with reduced synaptic plasticity,
and TFEB is known to protect against neurodegeneration in vivo in the brain, especially the dopaminergic
neurons. Even more important, the most frequent cause of overdose death due to opioids is opioid-induced
respiratory depression (OIRD) as well as damage to the lung tissue. Interestingly, TFEB overexpression can
decrease inflammation and mitochondrial damage in the lung tissue thereby protecting against acute lung
injury. Based on this overwhelming evidence we hypothesize that “As a master regulator of ALP, TFEB plays a
pivotal role in the mitigation of opioid tolerance and dependence by enhancing synaptic plasticity in the brain”.
In specific aim 1, we will use SH-SY5Y cells and striatal primary neurons to verify whether TFEB
overexpression or siRNA-mediated knockdown alters morphine-, fentanyl-, DAMGO, and Methadone-induced
MOR desensitization, internalization, and stability. Specific aim 2 is an in vivo study designed to assess
whether TFEB or its activator TPI-132 influences MOR agonist-induced analgesia, dependence, tolerance,
respiratory depression, and withdrawal symptoms using flag-TFEB, TFEB-/- mice and wild-type mice after sub-
chronic exposure to morphine and fentanyl. To increase rigor, we have included two cell types, multiple
opioids, different time points, doses. If TFEB indeed mitigates opioid addiction and tolerance, TPI-132 that can
activate TFEB and autophagy may be developed as novel and excellent therapy for OUD and overdose deaths"
10844151,"Project Summary
 The functional significance of actin in cellular health and fitness is unquestionable, as the actin
cytoskeleton is required for a diverse array of cellular processes as simple as movement and motility. The loss
of function of actin is seen in clinical manifestations in many diseases, and specifically during the aging process.
However, these studies are limited to the cytoplasm, despite actin being identified in the nucleus over 50 years
ago. The lack of studies of nuclear actin during aging is likely owning to the poorly understood mechanistic
function and the available tools to study nuclear actin. In fact, even studies of cytoplasmic actin during aging is
still a burgeoning field, making the studies of nuclear actin even more elusive. This highly innovative proposal
aims to tackle this major black hole in the field, leveraging our expertise in cytoplasmic actin to shift our research
direction into studying nuclear actin in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation.
 Our first goal is to synthesize a robust method to visualize the quality, function, and dynamics of nuclear
actin during stress and aging in C. elegans. As a new field, there are still no existing tools to reliably study nuclear
actin in perhaps the most powerful genetic model organism for aging research. Therefore, we propose to
synthesize multiple methods to reliably stain the numerous variants of nuclear actin. Furthermore, we will
leverage diverse genetic methods to directly study how changes to nuclear actin stability, function, and dynamics
can impact the aging process. We hypothesize that nuclear actin dysfunction during aging contributes to
physiological consequences and perturbing nuclear actin can result in premature aging.
 Emerging studies have implicated nuclear actin in DNA and RNA regulation, quality control, and function,
which is unsurprising considering the contents of the nucleus. Here, we aim to study the hypothesis that nuclear
actin can influence DNA repair. Specifically, we hypothesize that nuclear actin filaments form under stress to
recruit DNA repair machinery, and breakdown of this process is what leads to genomic instability and decline of
organismal health during aging. As an alternative hypothesis, we also propose that nuclear actin may play an
important role in transcriptional fidelity. Like DNA integrity, transcriptional fidelity is important to prevent the
synthesis of mutated proteins that can aggregate and cause physiological consequences during aging. Thus,
we argue that nuclear actin can drive protein homeostasis by preventing transcriptional errors, and the
breakdown of this functional process during aging can result in age-related disease.
 Ultimately, we propose to venture into two new research directions for our lab: nuclear actin and DNA
repair. Moreover, we propose to merge these two novel fields into a highly innovative study understanding how
nuclear actin impacts transcriptional fidelity and vice versa, creating a unique research proposal perfectly in line
with the vision of the Stephen I. Katz Early Stage Investigator Research Project Grant."
10846635,"Significance: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the leading cause of death from cancer in the U.S., is
plagued by racial disparities across the spectrum of care. Despite the fact that racial cancer disparities are long-
standing and well-described, fundamental knowledge gaps remain. First, the degree to which racial disparities
in NSCLC care and outcomes vary across geographic regions has not been thoroughly explored. Second, little is
known about how contextual factors contribute to racial disparities at the regional level. Historically, health
services research has focused on the healthcare system as the primary driver of racial disparities, with a limited
exploration of contextual factors such as health care segregation and structural racism. Further, it is unclear
how key stakeholders within the healthcare and community settings address and overcome barriers to
equitable NSCLC care. Objective: We will address these critical knowledge gaps, with the overarching goal of
mitigating racial disparities in NSCLC diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes, by identifying modifiable structural
and health system/intermediary factors and strategies that influence equity in lung cancer care. We intend to
conduct an explanatory sequential mixed methods study, combining novel retrospective, population-based
studies of racial disparity in lung cancer care with a positive deviance analysis. Through qualitative interviews
with key stakeholders in regions with high versus low racial disparities, we will reveal strategies and structures
that influence equity in lung cancer care and outcomes. Our hypothesis is that the magnitude of racial
disparities varies substantially across counties, and this variation does not arise by accident – there are specific
contextual factors, such as structural racism, segregation, and health system factors, that exacerbate
disparities. Specific Aims: We propose an explanatory sequential mixed methods study of Medicare
beneficiaries diagnosed with NSCLC from 2013 through 2017: (1) To assess variation in racial disparities in
NSCLC care (non-Latinx Black vs. non-Latinx White) across counties within SEER regions. (2) To assess
structural/foundational factors (e.g. structural racism, socioeconomic inequality) associated with area-level
racial disparities in NSCLC care. (3) To assess health system/intermediary determinants (e.g. hospital
characteristics and competition, patient segregation) of area-level racial disparities in NSCLC care. (4) To
identify stakeholder strategies associated with ensuring equitable NSCLC care in counties that have similar
socioeconomic characteristics, yet higher versus lower racial disparities. The proposed mixed methods study
will have a high impact, using a combination of innovative methods to move beyond traditional health system
factors to identify modifiable structural, socioeconomic, and social factors that contribute to lung cancer
disparities. Furthermore, we will elucidate strategies that stakeholders have used to decrease racial disparities,
identifying approaches that can be adopted more broadly to improve equity in NSCLC care."

The mission of the HIPC program at LJI is to use hypothesis-free approaches to define comprehensive molecular
profiles of T cell subsets in the context of lung pathogens. The areas of interest cover an extremely wide spectrum
of “omics” analysis including: (i) analysis of global gene expression (bulk and single-cell RNA-seq), (ii) analysis
of T cell receptors high variable sequences repertoire by bulk or single-cell TCR-seq, (iii) analysis of changes in
global epigenetics profiles (genome-wide enhancer profiles) using single-cell ATAC-seq, in T cell memory
subsets from patients infected and/or vaccinated against, SARS-CoV-2, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and
other lung pathogens. All these “omics” applications rely on standardized and well-validated high-throughput
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods – a key service provided by this Core.
The Sequencing Core will support all NGS activities for all the three projects involved in this program. This will
be facilitated by the extensive genomics expertise of its personnel and the availability of cutting-edge
technologies and automated platforms to generate highly reproducible and robust sequencing data from a large
number of samples. Practically, the Sequencing Core will interface directly with all three Projects and provide a
standardized and quality-controlled pipeline consisting of receiving samples, sorting cells, preparing RNA/DNA,
preparing libraries for high-throughput NGS, and transferring the resulting data to the Data Management and

10854756,"Project Summary: Project 1
The current LJI HIPC Proposal focuses on common pathogens causing infectious diseases of the respiratory
tract. Here in Project 1, our focus is to define changes of antigen-specific T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2
vaccination over time, up to 3 years post vaccination; and compare them to those observed in natural infection
or previously-infected, but now recently-vaccinated subjects.
We will examine T cell phenotypes defined by cytometric analysis of reference panels of markers. T cell sub-
populations defined by transcriptomes of single-cells, and T cell clonality defined by single-cell T cell receptor
(TCR) sequence analysis. These unbiased studies will define features associated with the magnitude and
persistence of antigen-specific T cell responses.
The data generated in the context of SARS-CoV-2 will then be compared the data to T cell responses induced
by natural infection with common cold coronaviruses (CCC). This will provide a comparator with other much less
pathogenic coronaviruses.
Our studies will further detail and compare the results of vaccination with different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
platforms (Moderna, Pfizer, J&J and others that might be authorized). In parallel, we will investigate samples
from two studies involving two commonly utilized vaccines, namely those against Yellow Fever and Pertussis.
Finally, our studies will also provide a large cross-sectional cohort, to address, on one hand, differences in
disease severity, ranging from mild to moderate to severe, and the impact of variables such as age, sex, ethnicity,
disease severity, and exposure to CCC viruses on the magnitude and persistence of vaccine-induced T cell
responses."

We are requesting funds to purchase an Abberior Facility-line STED microscope for the Advance Cell Imaging
Core (ACIC) at the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW). This instrument will serve a primary user group of 14
investigators, most of whom are well-funded by NIH. These investigators study a variety of projects across
diverse fields in cell biology, neuroscience, endocrinology, microbiology, cancer biology, and drug discovery. A
common feature of these research projects is the deep reliance on microscopy to understand how molecule-
scale structures dictate cell- and tissue-scale function. However, these investigators are facing a major barrier:
the lack of access to a suitable super-resolution imaging system to resolve and monitor the nanostructures of
interest. STED microscopy is an ideal solution over other super-resolution strategies (e.g., PALM, STORM,
SIM, and ExM) for this research community because it operates similarly to confocal as a turn-key system and
provides about a 5-fold or higher resolution increase. Many users in this group have ample expertise in
confocal microscopy and quantification, making STED implementation easier. Abberior 3D-STED provides not
only excellent resolution but also combines the latest innovations that facilitate super-resolution imaging in
thicker tissues and live cells. As there is no single STED microscope in our medical school and other
universities in Milwaukee, its acquisition will significantly propel the research progress across multiple
departments, programs, and institutions in southeastern Wisconsin. This instrument will provide mechanistic
understandings of diverse biomedical topics, such as synapses, ion channels, receptor function, autophagy
trafficking, mitochondrial dynamics, intracellular signaling, cell migration, organ development, and
neurodegeneration. These projects will benefit from access to this STED nanoscope. This instrument will be
installed at the imaging core (ACIC) and maintained by the experienced, PhD-level staff. Together, the
acquisition of the Abberior 3D-STED microscope will promote new understandings of cellular structures,
dynamics, and function at the nanometer scale, which is highly relevant to human health and disease. This
instrument will significantly accelerate NIH-funded research programs at MCW and other institutions in the
region. This application responds to PAR-22-079 “High-End Instrumentation (HEI) Grant Program”"

turnover to ensure the best training environment for Ph.D. candidates. A holistic review admits 20-24 trainees
from a robust pool size of ~150 training grant eligible candidates, which recently increased by 40% with a
doubling of underrepresented minority applications following an evidence-based decision to remove the GRE
requirement. The training program will leverage institutional funds to defray tuition charges in all years, support
administration and all program activities and guarantee trainee support. The first year curriculum will begin with
the intensive Introduction to Human Body course that combines hands-on dissection of the human cadaver,
virtual histology labs, in-class and e-lectures, and group presentations by students. Following a basic science
curriculum covering principles in molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry and cell biology, accompanied by
three 10-week laboratory rotations, the year will end with Introduction to Clinical Research and Cellular and
Molecular Basis of Disease that covers a spectrum of clinically and/or socially relevant disorders of the human
body, completing the cycle of the year from ""book to bench to bedside"". Other program-specific activities will
include a Grant Writing workshop, a newly developed Rigor and Reproducibility in Research (3R) course and
an individualized Bench to Bedside and Back (3B) clinical experience under the direction of a clinical co-
mentor in years 3-4. The program sponsors an Annual Retreat, journal club and student-run research in
progress seminar series. Structured career training opportunities in teaching and non-academic tracks
(OPTIONS) are built into the curriculum requirements and graduates pursue diverse research careers including
academic faculty (20%), industry (31%), physician scientists (19%), government (6%), business, policy or as
postdoctoral fellows. Attrition rates are low (5.5%) and time to graduation has averaged 5.7 years. In summary,

Over the past 5-10 years, the opioid epidemic has become a national crisis in the United States. Currently, few
good treatment options exist, and little is known about the underlying mechanisms contributing to risk for
addiction and to drug effects on the brain. This project addresses both of these issues using a rat genetic
model to identify genetic contributions to phenotypes associated with the development of opioid use disorders.
We will identify oxycodone-related phenotypic, genotypic, and RNA expression differences within the
HXB/BXH RI strains and 15 additional inbred rat strains for which genetic data are available, drawn from the
Hybrid Rat Diversity Panel (HRDP). Our preliminary phenotypic data suggest that the founder strains
SHR/OlaIpcv and BN-Lx/Cub, along with the ACI strain, differ on many of the phenotypic traits assessed
including the self-administration of oxycodone. In Aim 1, 48 inbred rat strains will be assessed for multiple
oxycodone-related behavioral phenotypes, including measures of analgesia. Quantitative trait loci (QTL)
associated with these behaviors will be identified using existing genetic data. In Aim 2, we will perform RNA
sequencing using tissue from the nucleus accumbens and amygdala in naïve animals and in rats following
oxycodone self-administration. This will identify genes that differ by strain, which will be informative about
baseline risk by genotype, and also identify genes that differ in response to oxycodone (shared and unshared
across strains). Because genes do not operate independently, but work in networks and pathways, Aim 3 will
employ a systems genetics approach to identify genetic networks involved in baseline differences across
strains and in the response to oxycodone self-administration. Across all aims, we will compare the QTL
regions, RNA expression differences, and gene network pathways to those found by others in the field using
complementary rodent models and/or human studies (including our collaborator Dr. Olivier George) in order to
narrow focus on priority genes and pathways."

The Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology (CSDE) at the University of Washington
proposes a training program to create a new generation of population scientists and
demographers equipped with skills to conduct data intensive research with advanced
computational and statistical methods. Population science provides a crucial interdisciplinary
framework for understanding the social, economic, political, and demographic dynamics affecting
patterns of disease, mortality, fertility, and migration, but to extract signal from noise in the
complex interplay of these processes the next generation requires a training in state-of-the-art
methods. The program will prepare trainees to be leaders in problems involving a wide range of
complex data, including data arising from multiple sources, data not intended for research (e.g.
administrative data), dynamic or spatial data, network data, and “big data’’ sources. At the core
of this program is a collaboration between CSDE, the eScience Institute (UW’s data science
center), and the Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences (CSSS). These three institutes
combine extensive expertise in demographic methods, data science, computer science and
statistical methods and have a long, successful record of collaboration on research and training
activities, including a BD2K track in Big Data for Demographic Research. Through this
collaboration, trainees will take a series of coursework in the following areas: advanced statistical
methods and machine learning, coding, databases, data visualization/communication, and data
ethics. Trainees will also take part in team-mentoring processes, where they develop an
apprenticeship relationship with a primary mentor but also learn directly from other faculty and
trainees through collaborative projects and seminars. Mentors will come from all three centers,
along with a variety of additional departments, selected to provide the most relevant expertise,
including multiple faculty from the highly-ranked departments of Biostatistics, Statistics and
Computer Science & Engineering. Further, trainees will get hands-on experience through

Funds are requested to purchase a Thermo Fisher Scientific Orbitrap IQ-X Mass Spectrometer
System with Vanquish Flex UHPLC System (IQ-X) to establish a unique omics capability at the
University of South Florida (USF), with analytical performance that is not currently available as a
shared resource, for detailed, high-resolution structural analysis of low-level small molecules in
complex biological matrices. Specifically, we have developed Nucleic Acid Adductomics (NAA)
which aims to describe the totality of modifications in the genome i.e., DNA, and RNA products
plus other significant classes of adducts e.g., DNA-DNA, RNA-RNA, DNA-protein, and RNA-
protein crosslinks, all of which are implicated in pathogenesis. The requested instrument will be
the only one of its kind outside of Taiwan performing NAA, and will support efforts to better
understand the role of NA modifications in health and disease. Over twelve NIH-funded principal
investigators (major users, representing 24 awards) across USF/Moffitt Comprehensive Cancer
Center need the analytical capabilities provided by the IQ-X. Specifically, they need to identify the
diverse range of NA modification types, and an unprecedented number of individual adducts,
through ultra-high mass measurement accuracy and resolution, and unique scanning features
(e.g., neutral loss-driven MS2 or MSn analysis for structure elucidation), while maintaining a
respectable sample analysis time. An accompanying need is to perform targeted adductomics for
specific nucleic acid-derived biomarkers in complex matrices with significant chemical noise. For
analytical and user convenience, the instrument will be housed within the Proteomics Facility
located in the Florida Center for Excellence for Drug Discovery and Innovation, at USF. The
instrument will support NIH-funded investigators from multiple departments across major USF
colleges (e.g., Arts and Sciences, Medicine, Public Health) and Moffitt. The IQ-X will be the first
instrument of its kind at USF, and will be dedicated to performing non-targeted and targeted NAA,
with options to focus on cellular, nuclear, or mitochondrial targets, and extracellular matrices, such
as urine. The instrument will be used to enhance basic and translational, NIH-funded research
programs at USF/Moffitt that cover a wide range of topics e.g., infectious disease, genome
instability, carcinogenesis, respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological disorders. This cutting-
edge technology will accelerate new and important discoveries for multiple projects, as well as
opening new directions of research in the biomedical sciences, and improving our understanding
of the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis."
10854834,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiomyopathy (CM) encompasses a diverse group of diseases of the heart muscle that occur in 1 out of 500
adults and predispose to heart failure. Accurate determination of CM subtype (phenotyping) is essential to inform
downstream tests, risk stratification, and targeted treatments. Cardiac MRI has emerged as the non-invasive
standard for assessment of cardiac structure, function, and tissue properties in patients with suspected CM.
However, cardiac MRI only comprises 1% of all MRI exams in the US, largely due to the need for (1) long and
complex protocols where multiple images are collected with different contrast weightings, (2) unreliable and
uncomfortable strategies to reduce motion, and (3) a lack of reproducibility of certain tissue property
measurements. This multidisciplinary project between MRI scientists and cardiologists will validate 3D cine
Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) as a comprehensive all-in-one imaging technique for CM detection
and phenotyping. A streamlined and paradigm-changing cardiac MRI exam is proposed, consisting of a 5-minute
free-breathing and ungated 3D cine MRF scan that will be collected before and after administration of gadolinium
contrast. This technique will yield quantitative T1, T2, and spin density (M0) maps with 3D isotropic coverage over
the left (LV) and right (RV) ventricles. Additionally, measured tissue properties and MRI simulations will be used
to generate contrast-weighted cine and LGE images in an automated fashion, eliminating the need for multiple
acquisitions and manual scan adjustments. A multicontrast LGE approach is also proposed where bright-blood,
dark-blood, and novel “optimal-contrast” images will be generated to optimally highlight myocardial scar and
fibrosis. The 3D cine MRF exam is expected to have advantages over routine clinical imaging and existing rapid
imaging methods in terms of (1) improved accuracy/reproducibility of quantitative tissue properties, (2) shorter
exam times, (3) reduced operator dependence, and (4) high diagnostic accuracy for specific CM phenotypes.
Technical validation of 3D cine MRF in healthy subjects will be performed in Aim 1, including development of
cardiac/respiratory self-gating methods tailored for MRF and development of a “physics-informed” deep learning
reconstruction for artifact reduction and scan acceleration. Aim 2 will compare image quality and quantitative
measurements from 3D cine MRF to standard MRI methods in patients with established CM. Additionally,
quantitative thresholds for objective detection of specific CM phenotypes will be determined. In Aim 3, tissue
properties and synthetic images derived from 3D cine MRF for will be tested in a prospective cross-sectional
study to evaluate diagnostic accuracy for differentiating (1) ischemic vs nonischemic CM and (2) nonischemic
CM phenotypes, using a standard cardiac MRI protocol as reference. The overall expected outcome of this work
is an ultrafast all-in-one MRI exam for CM detection and phenotyping that will streamline cardiac MRI exams and
assess cardiac structure, function, and tissue properties using reproducible quantitative imaging."

Immunology was a key element in the development of scientific medicine, and has since been a constant
source of extraordinary discovery that enriches every area of contemporary biomedicine from basic science to
translational and clinical research. Immunology established the foundation upon which our understanding of
infectious disease and vaccinology has been, and is being, built. As immunology pervades all of biomedical
science, so do a wide swath of biomedical disciplines support contemporary immunology. Microbiology,
molecular biology, cell biology, and computational biology among others are essential strands in the fabric of
immunology. This dually-distributed nature of immunology represents an extraordinary achievement for the
field, but simultaneously presents a challenge in training the next generation of innovators and scientific
leaders.
 We propose to continue our successful Immunology Training Program (ITP), now completing its 30th
year of producing accomplished immunological researchers, preserving the factors that have contributed to its
success and draw on the specific strengths of Boston University and the Boston Medical Center, while
adapting to the changing environment in scientific funding, cross-disciplinary research, and Computing and
Experimental Technology.
 We intend to develop and maintain the infrastructure necessary to foster an interdepartmental program,
building connections among faculty members across many departments on the Medical and Charles River
Campuses. We will continue to reach out to faculty members in new and emerging fields with the potential to
generate innovative approaches to human health through immunology, and provide valuable cross-disciplinary
training to future leaders in immunology. An integral part of this training will focus on research integrity, the
proper conduct of scientific investigation, and ethical treatment of others.
 We will continue to recruit outstanding young students committed to careers in basic, translational, and
clinical science, and provide attractive opportunities to students from disadvantaged backgrounds—women
and underrepresented minorities in particular.
 We will continually monitor trainee progress, and the effectiveness of the program overall, and take
whatever actions are necessary to ensure success individually and collectively."
10851349,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The loss of the tumor suppressor gene SMARCB1, a core member of the SWItch/sucrose non-fermentable
(SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex, defines a group of malignancies characterized by a particularly
aggressive clinical course and prominent metastatic behavior. Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is the most
commonly diagnosed SMARCB1-deficient renal malignancy and predominantly afflicts young individuals of
African descent carrying the sickle cell trait. SMARCB1-deficient renal malignancies are extremely challenging
diseases that fail to respond to standard-of-care therapeutic regimens used for other renal tumors. In our
recent work, we found that SMARCB1-deficient renal malignancies such as RMC are characterized by a highly
inflamed phenotype, yet demonstrate accelerated tumor progression (hyperprogression) in response to standard
immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). Our preliminary data in prospectively collected tissue specimens and
immunocompetent genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of RMC suggest that this hyperprogression
following ICI is due to the engagement of myeloid-affiliated transcriptional programs in tumor cells. Our
overarching hypothesis is that the hijacking of myeloid-affiliated transcriptional circuits by SMARCB1-deficient
renal malignancies is the major mechanism driving ICI-induced hyperprogression, which can be prevented by
targeting master myeloid regulators such as S100A9 and the CEBPB/p300 complex. In the first aim, we will
perform immunogenomic profiling studies at the single-cell level in our clinical trial tissue specimens and
immunocompetent GEMMs to determine how ICIs, using anti-PD-1 alone or in combination with either anti-
CTLA-4 or anti-LAG-3, modulate the tumor immune microenvironment to drive hyperprogression via the
engagement of myeloid-affiliated transcriptional pathways. In the second aim, we will perform translational
genomic and pharmacologic experiments in our GEMMs of RMC to determine whether targeting S100A9 or the
CEBPB/p300 complex can induce sensitivity to ICIs in SMARCB1-deficient renal malignancies. In the third aim,
we will utilize a first-in-class technology that enables the retrieval of ICI therapy-resistant clones to investigate
clonal dynamics in our GEMMs and determine the role of SMARCB1 loss in the engagement of myeloid-related
transcriptional pathways and subsequent hyperprogression of tumor cells following ICI treatment. This project is
realistic and feasible within the proposed timeline and budget because it utilizes technology, tissue samples,
and models of SMARCB1-deficient renal malignancies already available to the multidisciplinary research team
of experts and a dedicated translational pipeline led by the PI, Dr. Pavlos Msaouel. Our approach can provide
fundamental information about the mechanisms of ICI-induced hyperprogression in SMARCB1-deficient renal
malignancies, which will substantially improve our understanding of how to optimally elicit antitumor immune
responses and thus will open new therapeutic avenues for these and other diseases driven by loss of SMARCB1
or of other subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex."

Traumatic injuries disrupt immune system homeostasis, which can predispose patients to opportunistic
infections and other trauma-associated complications like systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS),
organ damage, and chronic critical illnesses. Trauma induces unique and complex host responses that are
initiated by tissue damage and the release of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that trigger
specific immune reactions. We identified that a subset of CD4+ T cells called regulatory T cells (Tregs) are
acutely activated by injury in a mouse burn trauma model. The counter-inflammatory suppressive activity of
Tregs is enhanced by trauma, which suggests that Tregs may control the intensity of post-trauma inflammation
and restoration of immune system homeostasis. People can have different numbers of Tregs in their tissues or
have different functional Treg responses to trauma that could determine trajectory of their response to
traumatic injuries. Our hypothesis is that Tregs control immune reactions to DAMPs and influence the
trajectory of the host response to trauma. To address this hypothesis, we propose a series of trauma
immunology studies to systematically interrogate; 1) Treg control of immune system phenotypes and
homeostasis, 2) trauma-induced Treg activation mechanisms, and 3) effects of modulating Tregs on immune
phenotypes, anti-microbial immune function, and the two-hit SIRS response. The specific aims for this project
are; 1) To determine how CD4+ Tregs control immune system reactivity to trauma, 2) To define the specificity
and molecular nature of trauma-reactive CD4+ Tregs and other T cells, 3) To investigate how CD4+ Tregs
influence anti-microbial immunity and two-hit SIRS. We anticipate that the outcome of this research will
significantly advance our fundamental knowledge of specific immune mechanisms that modulate trauma
immunity. We have several significant goals that we wish to achieve during the course of this project; 1) to
provide new insights into the biology of Treg activation and function, 2) to develop a deeper understanding of
immune system control of the mammalian trauma response, and 3) to explore the therapeutic potential of
modulating Treg activation and function as a specific trauma immunotherapy to improve immune function and
balance following trauma."

The widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in developed countries has modified HIV infection from a
terminal illness to what is now largely a manageable chronic infection. Even when HIV replication is suppressed
with ART, people infected with HIV present with a chronic inflammatory state that is thought to contribute to the
development of neurologic and psychiatric co-morbid conditions. A growing body of evidence is implicating the
innate immune system with sensitization of the brain to neurological damage associated with HIV infection and
other neurodegenerative conditions. This non-resolving inflammatory/immune response sensitizes and primes
the brain for any subsequent inflammatory event, and is thought to be a form of innate immune memory in which
microglia adapt their phenotype depending on the stimulus they are exposed to, and the frequency with which
they are exposed to that stimulus. This adaptation is a form of innate immune memory that can be associated
with long-lasting molecular reprogramming that can either enhance or suppress the microglial response to
subsequent stimuli. The impact of HIV infection, and ART on microglial reprogramming is unknown. Here we
have identified the sphingomyelin hydrolase neutral sphingomyelinase2 (nSMase2) generated ceramide as a
critical regulator of the innate immune response to ART suppressed HIV infection."
10842861,"Project Summary
Telomeres are essential structures located at the ends of linear chromosomes that protect genomic integrity
by preventing chromosomal fusion, degradation, and activation of DNA damage response pathways. The
telomerase reverse transcriptase maintains telomere length to compensate for telomere erosion by adding
short DNA repeat sequences to chromosome ends. In the absence of telomerase, telomeres progressively
shorten with each cell division due to the end-replication problem and nucleolytic processing. Critically short
telomeres ultimately induce cellular senescence or apoptosis. Dysregulation of telomere homeostasis has
been implicated in many human diseases, including cancer and rare genetic syndromes. Yet, the molecular
mechanisms underlying telomere/telomerase biology and the interplay between telomere dysfunction and
disease pathology are still not fully understood. With our previous NIGMS funding, we investigated
telomeres/telomerase from ciliates, yeasts, and vertebrates to uncover conserved structural features of
telomerase RNA, protein subunits, and telomere DNA. We used a combination of biochemical, structural,
computational, and novel single-molecule biophysical methods to study the function and dynamics of
telomerase and telomere DNA. Our results, together with the progress made in other laboratories, advanced
detailed mechanistic models for telomerase enzyme assembly, spatiotemporal regulation of telomerase
recruitment to telomeres, telomere chromatin remodeling by shelterin proteins, and coordinated
conformational changes within telomerase during its complex catalytic cycle. We are now uniquely positioned
to critically evaluate these models with our established state-of-the-art methodologies. The insights gained
from this research will provide a framework for the development of new therapeutic strategies and preventive
measures for telomere-related disorders. Funding from the MIRA will provide the necessary resources and
ﬂexibility to pursue new avenues of mechanistic research within the rapidly developing ﬁeld of telomere and
telomerase biology."

Mechanisms of enhancer dynamics and assembly in gene regulation
Effective gene regulation is essential for the proper functioning of cells. Dynamic control of enhancer
repertoires drives stage-specific transcription during tissue development and disease progression. The overall
objective of our research program is to gain a fundamental understanding of the regulations of enhancer
dynamics in response to signaling and their effects on gene regulation, leading to innovative approaches to the
prevention and treatment of enhancer-related diseases. We propose the following two themes to pursue this
objective from multiple levels: from the enhancer chromatin organization, to the coordination of enhanceosome
components, and the molecular interactions that drive enhancer assembly. Supported by the NIGMS R01 grant
(R01GM137009) and other grants, we have made significant progress in both themes, and the results gained
from our previous studies form the strong foundation of this MIRA research program.
Theme 1: To profile the context-specific enhancer dynamics and understand its functional
significance. Our previous studies have revealed that enhancer dynamics can be induced by 1) acute
hormone stimulations, which can build up the active enhancer machinery in just minutes at many chromatin
sites to turn on gene expression, and 2) chronic disease progression towards tamoxifen resistance, which
reprograms the ERα cistrome to evade endocrine therapies in breast cancer. With these two established
model systems (acute and chronic signaling), we will 1) capture the dynamic enhancer chromatin organization
with multi-omics analyses and identify candidate key transcription factors associated with enhancer
reprogramming using bioinformatic approaches; 2) define stage-specific enhanceosome components using in
vivo proximity-dependent biotin labeling BioID/TurboID technologies; and 3) introduce a series of perturbations
to understand how disruption of enhancer dynamics affects transcriptional activation and cell state.
Theme 2: To decipher inter- and intra-molecular interactions of enhancer components and their
contributions to enhancer assembly. Enhancer activation relies on proper enhancer assembly, but the
molecular mechanisms of enhancer assembly (how protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions occur) are
unclear. We have revealed important principles of enhancer assembly, including combinatorial interactions of
multiple transcription factors on hormone-regulated enhancers, and phase-separated condensation mediated
by hormone receptor multivalent interactions. Further studies will employ a diverse set of genetic and genomic
approaches, as well as our recently established imaging-based approaches, including the LacO arrays/LacI-
fluorescence proteins system and a single-molecular tracking (SMT) imaging system. Specifically, we plan to
1) investigate the behaviors of homotypic and heterotypic multivalent interactions of enhanceosome
components and their contributions to enhancer assembly; and 2) dissect the intra-molecular interactions of
hormone receptors in response to ligand binding and their roles in regulating enhancer assembly and activity."

 Indigenous children, including those who identify as Diné (Navajo, meaning “The People”),
have inequitable access to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis and treatment services.
ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition, which can be diagnosed in early childhood. The
objective of the Advancing Hózhó in Autism Assessment (AHAA) for Diné Families study is
to develop recommendations to ensure that ASD assessment practices and the context in which
assessments occur are culturally responsive. Assessment practices and contexts encompass
the assessment experience for Diné children and parents/guardians. This study is aligned with
the National Institute of Mental Health’s strategic plan to advance equity in ASD services and
outcomes, as well as the recommendation of the Lancet Commission on the future of care and
clinical research in autism to prioritize research strategies that have an emphasis on
“understanding what interventions work, for whom, when, how, and with what general
outcomes.”
 Our central hypothesis, substantiated through research examining practitioner confidence
and expertise in working with diverse children and families,6 is that a lack of culturally
responsive ASD assessment practices along with the contexts in which assessments occur for
Diné children and parents/guardians contributes to inaccurate ASD diagnosis and inequitable
ASD services access. Our long-term goal is to ensure that ASD services are culturally
responsive for Diné families and to reduce persistent ASD inequities for Indigenous
communities.
 Aim 1: Determine how ASD assessment practices and the assessment context align or
misalign with cultural beliefs, including Hózhó, among Diné families by conducting
interviews with 15 Diné parents/guardians of children ages 2-6 years who have experienced ASD
diagnosis in the last 12 months.
 Aim 2: Describe practitioner perspectives on how ASD assessments are conducted
with Diné families including cultural adaptations made or not made through interviews with
15 ASD practitioners and a survey of 55 ASD practitioners.
 Aim 3: Identify the cultural adaptations made by interdisciplinary ASD assessment
teams with Diné children and their participating parents/guardians through the observation
of 10 assessments with Diné children ages 2-6."
10844465,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Significant rates of psychological distress have been found in patients across a range of genetic counseling
settings, including cancer, cardiology, prenatal and medical genetics. In many cases, these needs are profound
and unmet. Such data suggest that genetic counselors providing clinical care should routinely assess patients’
emotions and psychological impact. Accreditation boards for genetic counseling require this skill to achieve
certification, but there is no standard definition of a “psychosocial assessment” in genetic counseling nor
universal instruments to facilitate it. Those tools that do exist are questionnaire-based or specific to a clinical
indication, eg. hereditary cancer. We can look to other healthcare settings, such as social work and primary
care, to borrow tools which standardize the psychosocial assessment and which may be applicable in genetic
counseling. One such tool developed in primary care is the BATHE method: a structured technique consisting
of four questions that explore patients’ main presenting concerns, emotional affect and coping, paired with
guidance for empathic responses. Evidence from the primary care literature shows the BATHE method reduces
patient anxiety and improves patient empowerment. Providers find it concise and easy-to-learn, allowing for a
person-centered interaction without increasing consultation time. These characteristics combined make it an
attractive tool to pilot in genetic counseling, which provides patient-centered care while balancing information
delivery and support. For these reasons, we request funding through this NHGRI R21 mechanism to better
characterize the current state of psychosocial practices and pilot an innovative standardized way to provide
such an assessment in genetic counseling. These goals are in line with the NHGRI’s 2020 Strategic Vision to
promote patient empowerment around genomic information and train a workforce that is scalable and efficient.
First, this study will describe the current practices of psychosocial assessments in genetic counseling, using
descriptive content analysis of transcripts of a purposive sample of genetic counseling sessions at Stanford
Medicine. Second, this study will pilot a psychosocial assessment tool (the BATHE method) in genetic
counseling to assess its feasibility and acceptability by genetic counselors. Exploring patients’ perspectives,
patient-related outcomes, and influence of cultural differences are crucial, and the current study lays the
groundwork for this subsequent research. At the conclusion of our study, the findings from our aims will inform
the development of a genetic counseling-specific standardized psychosocial assessment. The ultimate goal of
this research is to build a foundation for investigation of patient outcomes in response to psychosocial
counseling approaches."

Histone deacetylases (HDACs), a family of enzymes that repress gene transcription through deacetylation,
represent one of the mechanisms through which environment can affect gene expression. Preclinical studies
have repeatedly demonstrated that the epigenetic enzymes HDACs play a key role for normal brain function,
including socio-emotional skills. In vivo and postmortem work in animals and humans has implicated regional
abnormalities in HDAC expression levels in psychiatric disorders. However, to date, little is known in terms of
the association between in vivo HDAC epigenetic enzymes expression and human behavior. The study of this
association is possible given the recent development of [11C]Martinostat, a positron emission tomography (PET)
imaging probe allowing the in vivo assessment of HDAC brain expression.
Neuropsychological traits associated with emotion regulation, social skills, anxiety, the ability or inability
(anhedonia) to experience pleasure, and sensitivity to reward are common and continuously distributed in the
general population. Taking advantage of this normal variation, we will investigate the relationships between
HDAC expression and neuropsychological profile. We propose to study the association between HDACs
expression determined by PET imaging and neuropsychological traits in healthy male and female young adults
(Aim 1). We will also investigate whether there are regional sex differences in HDAC brain expression in young
adults (Aim 2). Furthermore, using simultaneous PET- functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we will
determine the relationship between HDAC expression and brain activation in response to socio-emotional and
reward fMRI tasks (Aim 3).
In summary, this study will provide insights into the in vivo epigenetic landscape of HDACs in healthy male and
female adults, and its association with neuropsychological traits and brain activation. If regional HDACs
expression is sex-specific, it may contribute to known differences in disease susceptibility and disease
prevalence in males and females. A better understanding of normal epigenetic variations and their association
with behavioral phenotype in humans is an essential first step for the field of neuroepigenetics, and will have
implications for future studies investigating epigenetic dysregulation in psychiatric diseases."

The goal of this K24 is to provide support to allow Dr. Ashare to spend an additional 25% of her
time mentoring junior physician scientists in patient-oriented research on inflammatory lung
disease. This K24 will provide the opportunity for Dr. Ashare to expand her program in patient-
oriented translational research, integrate new physician scientists and PhD scientists into her
research program, and allow for additional protected time so she can mentor additional trainees.
In addition, with the help of her senior advisory committee, she will also use this time to improve
her own mentoring skills. This K24 describes two aims that involve patient-oriented translational
research using primary lung macrophages obtained from human subjects. Each Aim will serve
as an individual project for a new trainee. Aim1 exploits preliminary findings that macrophages
isolated from different regions of the lung are metabolically different and will specifically
investigate the impact of increased glycolytic metabolism in upper lobe macrophages on the
generation of inflammation. This aim will also determine the role of succinate accumulation in
the generation of the macrophage inflammatory response. Based upon our data demonstrating
that there are phenotypic and genotypic differences in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from
different regions of the CF lung, Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that regional P. aeruginosa
isolates differentially stimulate lung macrophage immune responses and exhibit different
responses to extracellular succinate. These two independent but complementary aims will allow
new trainees to pursue translational patient-oriented research projects that will lead to a greater
understanding of host-pathogen interactions in the CF lung."

This proposal is focused on developing a vaccine for prevention of Powassan virus (POWV)- associated disease.
POWV is a tick-borne flavivirus currently endemic to North America, primarily in the northeastern and north-
central regions of the United States and extending north into Canada. Due to the expanding range of Ixodid tick
vectors, POWV has the potential to become an emerging pathogen and public health threat. In humans, POWV
is a neurotropic virus that can lead to severe, sometimes fatal encephalitis and meningitis. We propose to
develop a vaccine based on non-replicating virus-like particle (VLP) antigens produced by expression of the viral
pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins in cultured cells followed by purification of VLP from the culture
supernatant. VLPs will be paired with one of several novel vaccine adjuvants that stimulate specific pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs). Each antigen/ adjuvant pairing will be tested in mice to quantify elicitation of
neutralizing antibodies and POWV-specific T cells. We will also characterize B- and T-cell phenotypes in detail
to determine how the vaccine-driven response compares to infection with intact POWV. Similarly to humans,
POWV infection of wild-type laboratory mice results in lethal infection of the brain and CNS. Therefore, we will
also evaluate vaccine efficacy in a challenge model of POWV infection in mice. Cohorts of mice vaccinated with
individual antigen/ adjuvant pairings will be challenged with a lethal dose of POWV. These cohorts will be
evaluated for increased survival, as well as, for reduction of viral load in tissues at multiple times post infection.
Upon completion of this project, we expect to have developed an optimally formulated POWV vaccine which
could move forward to clinical testing and be rapidly mobilized in the event of POWV emergence."
10850959,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 It is estimated that over 1.7 million hospital acquired infections per year in the U.S. result from microbial
biofilms. New approaches to specifically target and disrupt bacterial biofilms will thus have a significant impact
on human healthcare. Exopolysaccharides like poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) are critical biofilm
components that facilitate cell-cell interactions and serve as a protective barrier against the host’s immune
system and common antibiotic therapeutics used to treat bacterial infections. However, there is little is known
about the molecular interactions of PNAG with other biofilm EPS components. Blocking the interactions between
bacterial cells and PNAG or using glycosidase enzymes that break down PNAG and disrupt biofilms are attractive
approaches to treat biofilm infections.
 Overall, our goal is to characterize molecular interaction networks of exopolysaccharides like PNAG,
determine how they contribute to biofilm formation and dispersal, and develop novel strategies to treat biofilm
infections by blocking these interaction networks or by catalyzing the breakdown of critical biofilm EPS
components. To accomplish this overarching goal, we have identified two primary research areas for the next 5
years and plans for beyond. The first area seeks to develop tools for rapid identification of PNAG in bacterial
biofilms and develop a live cell proximity labeling platform for identification and subsequent characterization of
PNAG-binding proteins. These protein-carbohydrate binding interaction have the potential to be targets for new
anti-biofilm therapeutics. A second area will develop high-throughput approaches to identify and subsequently
engineer PNAG glycosidase enzymes through functional screening of environmental metagenomes and iterative
site saturation mutagenesis approaches. To enable these studies, we have developed new colorimetric and
fluorometric PNAG analogs that enable the high throughput identification of PNAG glycosidase activity. This
research will establish a platform in my laboratory to rapidly identify and develop novel biocatalysts for biofilm
dispersal activity. Overall, these research efforts will provide new unique insight into the role of PNAG in biofilm
formation and will provide tools that will impact the way that we approach treating biofilm infections."

Liver deformation leads to difficulties in tumor localization during minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS). The
goal of this proposal is to develop an efficient surgical navigation tool for MILS by compensating for liver
deformation and mapping preoperative data to the patient’s anatomy. Specifically, we will develop a non-rigid
simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) approach to estimate the deformation of liver surface from
stereo laparoscopy videos. We will develop machine-learning methods to detect landmarks and perform non-
rigid registration. The algorithms will be implemented on a GPU to achieve real-time. Preliminary data has
demonstrated the feasibility. During the R00 phase, we will mainly address the clinical needs and develop novel
ways to provide intraoperative guidance. This project will greatly improve the tumor resection accuracy in MILS.
The candidate for this award Dr. Haoyin Zhou is a postdoc at Surgical Planning Laboratory (SPL), Brigham and
Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). Dr. Zhou has extensive experience and expertise
in computer vision, machine learning and their applications in medicine. BWH is an international leader in basic,
clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to
promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. National Center for Image Guided
Therapy, and Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided Operating (AMIGO) suite will greatly support this research.
Dr. Zhou’s long-term research goal is to develop and apply advanced computer vision and machine learning
technologies to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases for better health care.
His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of medical image

The Molecular and Cell Biology Core (MCBC) of the Center for Lung Biology and Disease (CLBD) has been
created to meet the need for advanced molecular biology support by PJIs. The current application includes four
more JPI-led full projects that hold exceptional promise for being developed as independent investigators who
can compete nationally for categorial NIH funding. These projects require advanced molecular and cellular
biological principles, methods, and advances in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, immunology, and
microscopy to delineate fundamental cellular mechanisms leading to disease outcomes. In this Phase II renewal
application, the Molecular and Cell Biology Core (MCBC) proposes to continue to leverage, coordinate, and
expand the resources and expertise of the Division of Biotechnology and Molecular Medicine (BIOMMED) at
the LSU School of Veterinary Medicine. BIOMMED administers and coordinates access to specialized Core
Facilities, including the Gene Expression and Sequencing Laboratory (GeneLab), Viral Vectors Laboratory,
Protein Characterization and Purification Laboratory, which also generates monospecific and monoclonal
antibodies, and coordinates and facilitates access to a variety of other LSU Vet Med resources including the
LSU Vet Med Microscopy Center and the Shared Instrumentation Facility (main campus) which provides
advanced immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. MCBC offers biostatistics and advanced
bioinformatics analyses to analyze complex genomic and transcriptomic data to LSU and Louisiana researchers
in close collaboration with the LSU Center for Computation & Technology. MCBC aims to provide and
coordinate access to advanced instrumentation and services and develop and offer new molecular
methodologies. MCBC will also provide training for molecular biology and cell biology methodologies to all PJIs
and other NIH-funded investigators to achieve their research objectives. The MCBC has two specific aims: Aim
1. To provide the Center and other NIH-funded investigators with resources and expertise on advanced
molecular biology technologies, instrumentation, technical support, and development of molecular assays
needed for their projects. Aim 2. To organize, coordinate, and facilitate interactions among COBRE
investigators, mentors, and students; train PJIs and other faculty, staff, and students in advanced molecular
biology technologies; and establish long-term sustainability of all core services and functions. The MCBC
centralized molecular and cell biology services and training will provide outstanding capabilities in molecular
and cell biology methodologies. MCBC will streamline experimental tasks to maximize efficiency, productivity,
benefits, and efficient use of reagents, as well as assist PJIs in adopting and developing new technological
molecular and cell biology approaches."
10851555,"INHALATION AND INFECTION CORE – PROJECT SUMMARY
The new Inhalation and Infection Core (IIC) has been created to support the research need of the COBRE
Promising Junior Investigators (PJIs) and NIH-funded investigators in their endeavors to study the combination
of pulmonary infectious plus non-infectious agents within a single model and address mechanisms of
respiratory diseases under real-life environmental exposure scenarios. The goal of the IIC is to provide
expertise, assistance, and training, for the delivery of inhaled pollutants through novel exposure systems and
to generate animal infection models. In addition, the IIC will offer physiologically relevant air-liquid interface in
vitro models that closely mimic realistic pulmonary exposure conditions of inhaled toxicants and/or pathogens
at the blood-air interface. The IIC builds upon our current bio-safety level 1 (BSL-1) inhalation research
capability to expand into a BSL-2 area allowing inhalation exposures. Combining state-of-the-art capabilities for
inhalation exposures to environmental pollutants with infectious disease models will create a multi-disciplinary
platform, responsive to both current and future needs of JPIs, enabling investigators to conduct next level
inhalation research and gain unique insight into mechanisms of toxicity of specific pathogens using real-life risk
simulation approaches. The unique advantages offered by these infrastructural capabilities, which combine
expertise for inhalation exposures and infection models, will position ourselves as a major center of expertise
in the South. The IIC will provide experimental support via two specific aims. Aim 1. Create an all-inclusive
BSL-2 research environment for inhalation studies. This will be accomplished A) by providing support and
expertise to investigate interactions between human cells, pathogens, air pollutants and respiratory diseases,
and B) by provide experimental expertise allowing for the performance of in vitro and in vivo assays using both
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species. Aim 2. Provide training to CLBD graduate students, post-
doctoral fellows, and principal investigators on how to use the facilities and equipment provided by the IIC."
10851971,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Currently, conventional methods that have been utilized to characterize hematopoietic progenitors and their potentials including flow cytometry, in vitro colony-forming-unit assays and in vivo genetic marking are being vigorously complemented with genomics analyses such as single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) and scATACSeq. While these complementary analyses are defining a multitude of possible cell states, there is considerable confusion concerning the correspondence between such states and the heterogeneity/identity of cells captured within canonical flow cytometry gates, their developmental potentials, and mechanisms underlying lineage specification. To address this fundamental problem in the field we have assembled an interdisciplinary research team with deep expertise in the application of single-cell technologies, hematopoiesis, computational genomics and systems biology to develop and promote a unifying framework for the analysis of genomic states with their developmental potentials and trajectories. Specifically, we will define prevalent and rare hematopoietic intermediates as well as their developmental potencies, restrictions and trajectories, on the basis of their genomic states along with the optimal markers and flow gates necessary to isolate them. Using these genomic datasets coupled with analyses of poised or active enhancers interacting with promoters, we will infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that delineate the connectivity of transcription factors to their target genes thereby inferring control mechanisms underlying the distinctive genomic states. Thus, exploiting a consolidated biological, molecular and computational dissection of the hematopoietic system focusing on underlying genomic regulatory architectures, we will provide a new framework to incisively understand steady state hematopoiesis."

10848615,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over half of patients treated for cancer report concerns related to sexual health. If unaddressed, such concerns
can cause substantial distress and compromise patients’ health and overall well-being. Although clinical
guidelines uniformly recommend oncologists discuss sexual health with their patients, evidence suggests that
sexual health is overwhelmingly neglected in patients’ routine cancer care. Oncologists lack knowledge and skills
with which to effectively discuss sexual health, largely because most have received no relevant training. A recent
survey of hematology-oncology fellowship programs in the U.S. by our team found that the majority offer little to
no formal training in sexual health. The failure to educate hematology-oncology fellows on sexual health in the
face of prevalent cancer-related sexual problems and considerable patient distress constitutes a critical gap in
preparedness of the oncology workforce in the U.S. A training course for fellows on addressing cancer-related
sexual health is likely to be both highly acceptable and impactful because it would (a) fit well into the educational
setting of the fellowship program and (b) provide the foundation for clinicians-in-training to develop effective
clinical practice patterns that integrate regular communication about cancer-related sexual health. Therefore, we
propose to develop a novel virtual course, called Sexual Health Integrative Fellowship Training (SHIFT), that (a)
will provide education and skills training in communication about cancer-related sexual health to hematology-
oncology fellows and (b) is guided by theory, significant preliminary qualitative and intervention research by the
project team, and active involvement from a diverse Patient Advisory Board and other key stakeholders. Because
certain cancer patient subgroups (e.g., sexual and gender minority patients) may have unique cancer-related
sexual concerns and communication needs, SHIFT will include content to facilitate fellows’ effective
communication about sexual health with a diverse patient population. Aim 1 of the project is to develop the SHIFT
course, which we expect will improve hematology-oncology fellows’ knowledge, beliefs based in social cognitive
theory (i.e., self-efficacy and outcome expectancies for sexual health communication), and clinical
communication outcomes (i.e., comfort and communication about sexual health). Aim 2 is to evaluate the
acceptability and impact of SHIFT on knowledge, beliefs, and sexual health communication among two cohorts
of hematology-oncology fellows from Fox Chase Cancer Center (primary site) and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
We will then refine the course and plan for its dissemination. The proposed study will be the first to develop and
test a training course designed to equip fellows in oncology to address sexual health with their cancer patients.
This study represents a logical next step in an ongoing body of research centering on the development of
evidence-based interventions to improve patient-clinician communication about sexual health in cancer. The
overarching goal of this line of work is to improve the health and quality of life for patients with cancer through
integrating effective clinical communication about sexual health into their routine cancer care."

 2 Pitch and harmonicity play a defining role in the perception of speech and music, and are crucial for
 3 the perceptual organization of sounds in an auditory scene. Listeners with hearing loss, and
 4 especially those with cochlear implants, suffer from a striking deficit in pitch perception abilities, as
 5 current sound processing strategies are unable to provide robust pitch cues. Despite advances in our
 6 understanding of how pitch is perceived, coded, and represented in our auditory system, there are
 7 still significant gaps in our basic understanding of how pitch, and especially harmonicity, is
 8 represented in the auditory cortex. A better understanding of the neural transformations involved in
 9 pitch perception should help in designing more effective neural and acoustic prostheses. The overall
10 goal of the proposed project is to understand the neural representation of pitch and harmonicity and
11 elucidate the role of temporal integration in pitch perception using a combination of behavioral
12 (psychoacoustics), electrophysiology (EEG), and neuroimaging techniques (fMRI). In the mentored
13 K99 phase of this project, the candidate will conduct research on both of these overarching themes.
14 fMRI will be used to investigate what properties of harmonic complex tones are represented in
15 anterior-lateral regions of auditory cortex (Aim 1). Using carefully controlled stimuli, this study should
16 provide strong evidence for whether harmonic tones elicit a stronger response than inharmonic tones
17 in auditory cortex. The candidate will also conduct a series of behavioral experiments using a novel
18 stimulus that produces an illusory virtual pitch percept, to provide empirical data for quantifying the
19 parameters governing temporal integration in the perception of pitch (Aim 2). These behavioral
20 experiments will add crucial understanding of the temporal aspects of pitch perception, which are not
21 taken into account in current pitch perception models. In the R00 phase of the project, the candidate
22 will utilize the techniques and findings of Aims 1 and 2 to study two important aspects of pitch
23 processing and perception. A novel modification of the stimulus investigated in Aim 2 will be utilized in
24 an fMRI study to differentiate the cortical representations of different perceptual modes of listening,
25 namely synthetic and analytic. Additionally, this stimulus will also be used in an EEG study to explore
26 the neural correlates of the Pitch Onset Response (POR). Overall, this project will relate perceptual
27 characterizations of the illusory stimulus to neurophysiological findings to provide new insights to the
28 field of pitch perception, which in turn could motivate the development of novel pitch processing
29 strategies in auditory prostheses. The research performed and training provided during this award will
30 enable the candidate to achieve her goal of developing an independent research program that
31 employs both neurophysiological and behavioral approaches to investigate auditory phenomena."

 High-risk human papillomaviruses (HR HPVs) cause 5% of all cancers. There are preventive vaccines
against HPV, but less than 2% of the world's target population has received them. This leaves millions of women
and men at risk for HPV-associated cervical, anogenital, and head and neck cancers. We need to understand
how HR HPV establishes and maintains an active infection, while also driving cancer development, in order to
guide focused therapeutic interventions to prevent, arrest, and reverse disease.
 The greatest clinical risk factor for cervical cancer is a persistent HR HPV infection. This persistence
occurs through coordinated dysregulation of cellular pathways, which both support the infection and foster cancer
development. Underlying this dysregulation is the requirement that the HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 partner with
cellular proteins. Our work has focused on the E6 oncogene from HPV type 16 (16E6), the most common HR
HPV type in cancers. Previously, we found that 16E6 required the cellular protein NFX1-123, and its protein
partners cytoplasmic poly(A) binding proteins (PABPCs), to fully activate telomerase and the immortalization
pathway. Our current studies revealed that NFX1-123 is highly expressed in cervical cancers, and together 16E6,
NFX1-123, and PABPCs amplify telomerase, cellular growth, and longevity over time. We also discovered that
NFX1-123 is increased during differentiation and, together with 16E6, augments cellular differentiation cascades
and their host and viral gene targets while simultaneously protecting against concomitant cellular arrest and
senescence. These findings create a sightline for a new level of investigation that will uncover the connectivity
and control of growth and differentiation and the temporal changes driving and accelerating immortalization by
PABPCs, NFX1-123, and 16E6. These results will also delineate targets for future treatments that specifically
disrupt universal pathways required for HPV and its cancers.
 Our specific aims are: (1) Determine how 16E6, NFX1-123, and PABPCs work together in co-regulating
growth and differentiation to better establish a persistent infection. We will mimic the initial steps of establishing
a HR HPV infection to identify the way in which these proteins function to permit both differentiation and growth
in concert during the initial, foundational steps of a HR HPV infection. (2) Elucidate the mechanism of longitudinal,
sequential increases of hTERT and telomerase by 16E6, NFX1-123, and PABPCs. Telomerase activation leads
to cellular immortalization. We will leverage long-term cellular studies to determine the sequential changes to
hTERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, due to 16E6 with NFX1-123 and PABPCs and to create a roadmap
of molecular oncogenic progression that mirrors clinical chronology. Our proposed studies will elucidate the
temporal and interwoven dysregulation of oncogenic pathways by 16E6 and its host protein partners; they will
also provide foundational data on the oncogenic etiology and progression of increasingly common HPV-
associated cancers."

People living with HIV (PLWH) have higher rates of drug addiction compared with uninfected populations, and
often show faster rates of disease progression, including early and rapidly progressing cognitive impairments.
We have previously demonstrated that synaptic damage resulting from acute morphine administration self-
repairs during drug withdrawal. These repair mechanisms were not active in gp120 transgenic mice, and synaptic
repair failed during drug withdrawal. Although these observations in addition to a number of other studies that
have demonstrated interactions of morphine with HIV that ultimately reduce dendritic spine density, the precise
mechanisms for these interactions are not understood. Our preliminary findings suggests that the initial dendritic
damage induced by morphine involves activation of a non-canonical Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain,
Leucine rich Repeat and Pyrin domain containing (NLRP) inflammasome pathway in astrocytes that facilitates
the release of EVs carrying complement C3. This complement protein is opsonized in dendritic spines and targets
them for elimination by phagocytosis. The removal of morphine stops the shedding of complement C3 from
astrocytes, and dendritic spines can self-repair. However, in the setting of viral infection there is a sustained
activation of pattern recognition receptors on microglia with chronic activation of the classical NLRP
inflammasome pathway that maintains a state of persistent inflammation, This chronic inflammatory state
disallows dendritic spines to self-repair. Here we propose to use primary cell culture, EcoHIV infected mice, and
conditional transgenic systems to test the hypothesis that interactions between TLRs, the inflammasome, and
the complement system contribute to neuronal damage in PLHW who abuse opiates.

10832963,"Following return from the Gulf War (GW), veterans have experienced of a constellation of symptoms,
designated Gulf War Illness (GWI), that cannot be associated with a single disease. In this regard, GW
veterans exhibit structural and functional deficits in the central nervous system (CNS), along with
cardiovascular complications. One of the more insidious aspects of GWI is that it is a chronic and
progressive disorder; indeed, the number of veterans diagnosed with GWI continues to rise in the post-
deployment period. Although the mechanisms underlying the myriad of symptoms associated with GWI
remain to be elucidated, some studies have determined that GWI veterans exhibit exaggerated immune
responses to physiological stressors, which when combined with other studies support the concept that
neuroinflammation is a key component in the etiology and progression of GWI.
During the previous funding period we developed a rodent model of GWI in which rats were administered
the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor pyridostigmine bromide (PB) alone and in combination with
repeated restraint stress (RRS). Our ongoing studies have revealed that PB and RRS elicit alterations in
cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, neuroimmune and behavioral measures. Perhaps more importantly, our
preliminary studies indicate that these PB+RRS-induced alterations are exacerbated by lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) or acute exposure to heterogeneous social stressors. Such observations suggest that in addition to
baseline differences, a prior history of PB and stress may predispose GWI veterans to exaggerated
responses to immune challenges or stressful life experiences after deployment in the GW. Surprisingly,
relatively few studies have directly tested this hypothesis to determine the underlying mechanisms
responsible for exacerbated responses to stress or immune challenges after exposure to PB. Accordingly,
the goal of this project is to directly test our overarching hypothesis that immune challenges and stressful
stimuli lead to exacerbated neuroimmune, neurochemical, cardiovascular and behavioral deficits after
exposure to cholinesterase inhibition in an animal model of Gulf War Illness. This hypothesis will be tested
in the following Aims:
• Aim 1 will examine whether immune or stress challenges lead to potentiated neuroimmune responses in
 PB+RRS rats
• Aim 2 will determine whether LPS or to exposure social stress enhances cardiovascular complications in
 enhanced in PB+RRS rats.
• Aim 3 will determined whether the performance of hippocampal and prefrontal cortex-dependent
 behaviors are adversely affected by LPS administration or acute social stress.
Successful completion of these studies will demonstrate that PB treatment in combination with stress elicits
fundamental alterations in brain and body responses that may be much more evident following immune and
social stress challenges, which would be highly consistent with the progress nature of GWI
pathophysiology. Most importantly, these studies will identify loci for therapeutic intervention that can be
quickly tested in our model and implemented for the treatment of GWI in our veterans."
10832386,"Project Summary
Protein histidine phosphorylation plays an important role in several key signaling pathways in
mammals but is very poorly understood. The main reasons for this dearth of information about
histidine phosphorylation are the relative instability of pHis as compared to pSer, pThr, and pTyr
and a complete lack of chemical tools available to monitor and modulate the enzymes involved
in histidine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The Barrios laboratory is working to develop
fluorogenic assays that can be applied to monitoring cellular histidine phosphatase and histidine
kinase activity and to develop the first inhibitors of mammalian histidine phosphatase and
histidine kinase activity. We will investigate the structural and sequence contexts that facilitate
histidine phosphorylation and stabilize the resulting pHis residue and characterize the effects
that histidine phosphorylation has on protein structure and function, including enzymatic activity
and ability to bind metal ions. The tools, fundamental insights, and specific examples developed

and kinases and are expected to revolutionize the field. The ultimate goal of the work is to
elucidate the roles that histidine kinases and phosphatases play in cellular signaling, health, and
disease and to identify promising therapeutic targets and lead compounds that act on histidine

10833563,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification involved in transcriptional regulation of genes involved in
development and differentiation, and its deregulation contributes to human pathogenesis. It is catalyzed by the
family of DNA methyltransferases including catalytically active Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b. DNA methylation
plays a major role in preimplantation development in mice. To establish a new epigenome, the mouse zygotic
genome undergoes epigenetic reprogramming, including global DNA demethylation at the 8-cell stage. Upon
implantation, a wave of de novo methylation in epiblast cells mediated by de novo enzymes Dnmt3a and
Dnmt3b results in new methylation patterns maintained by Dnmt1 that form a basis for tissue-specific
expression and differentiation.
Dnmt3b regulates developmental and imprinted genes, X chromosome inactivation, pericentromeric regions,
gene bodies and other genomic regions. Its importance in mouse development was demonstrated by
embryonic lethality of Dnmt3b-/- mice. We recently found that Dnmt3bCI/CI mice expressing catalytically inactive
Dnmt3bCI protein survived both pre- and postnatal development. Molecular analysis suggested that accessory
function - the ability to recruit other Dnmts to proper genomic loci – of Dnmt3b rather than its catalytic activity,
is important for methylation and survival. Here we hypothesize that Dnmt3b is a multifaceted protein whose
various activities involved in methylation affect pre- and postnatal development and are critical to prevent
disease formation in mice. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 we analyze global methylation and expression at
different stages of development in mice lacking various Dnmt activities to determine the scope of Dnmt3b’s
accessory function in Dnmt3a-mediated de novo methylation in vivo as well as regulation of transcription of
various genomic features including gene bodies, germline genes and transposons. In Aim 2, will test the ability
of Dnmt3b to complex with other Dnmts and contribute to de novo methylation induced by other Dnmts in
Dnmt1-/-;Dnmt3a-/-;Dnmt3b-/- triple knockout mouse embryonic stem cells. In addition, we will genetically test
the importance of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3l for Dnmt3b’s accessory function and validate our data in a human cell
line. In Aim 3, we will perform longitudinal study of Dnmt3b+/+ and Dnmt3bCI/CI mice conceived through the use
of in vitro fertilization (IVF) technique to analyze disease development, Dnmt levels, the rate of methylation and
gene expression errors, as well as their persistence over time.
Collectively, our studies will reveal physiological relevance of Dnmt3b activities in mouse development,
uncover basic mechanisms utilizing Dnmt3b functions and their involvement in IVF. Our results could result in
changes in Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) and affect the focus of preventive care for ART-
conceived individuals."
10833568,"T cell tolerance depends heavily on the thymus, reflecting negative selection of effector T cells (Teffs)
and positive selection of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) are major players
in both of these processes. Beyond transcribing the genes encoding molecules needed for their maintenance
and function, mTECs express transcripts derived from much of the protein-coding genome, notably mRNAs
specifying proteins characteristic of mature peripheral cell-types (peripheral-tissue antigens or PTAs). While
the whole mTEC compartment expresses a large repertoire of PTA transcripts, an individual mTEC makes only
a small subset of them. Aire drives expression of most thymic PTA transcripts by a mechanism thought to
entail super-enhancer activation and remodeling of 3D chromatin structure. Hence, the reigning model to
account for the mTEC PTA repertoire focuses on quasi-random de-repression of gene transcription, with no
discernible biological logic. However, our unpublished scATAC-seq and multi-pronged downstream studies
argue for a different model: in fact, Aire promotes both the ectopic expression of PTA transcripts (in Aire-stage
mTECs) and the ectopic differentiation of peripheral cell-types (from post-Aire mTECs). While previous scRNA-
seq studies did uncover some ectopic mTEC clusters, our ATAC-seq approach substantially broadened these
observations and revealed the underlying logic: a diversity of ectopic mTEC subtypes, largely downstream of
Aire expression, are marked by the lineage-defining transcription factors (TFs), chromatin accessibility
landscapes and transcriptional programs of peripheral cell-types. While it is well established that the ectopic
transcripts characteristic of Aire-expressing mTECs play an important role in T cell tolerance, almost nothing is
known about the influence of post-Aire ectopic mTEC subtypes. Thus, the major goal of this project is to
elucidate the impact of ectopic mTEC subtypes on T cell tolerance, which will be addressed in three
Specific Aims: a. To determine whether ectopic mTEC subtypes induce T cell tolerance. Our initial approach
relies on the lineage-defining TF logic mentioned above and on exploiting a fluorescent-protein (FP)-targeting
strategy. Preliminary data demonstrate that specific targeting of eYFP to the M-cell mTEC subtype inhibits the
CD4+ T cell response to immunization with an eYFP peptide. We will extend this finding in several directions --
evaluating the mechanism, thymus dependence, Aire dependence, generality & implications for autoimmunity.
b. To examine the landscape and function of ectopic mTEC subtypes in perinatal mice. As this is a critical
window for induction of T cell tolerance, we will perform scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and functional comparisons
of mTECs from perinatal and adult mice to query the range and relative importance of ectopic mTEC subtypes
at the two ages. c. To determine whether extrinsic signaling to ectopic mTEC subtypes expands their PTA
repertoires. We will broadly and specifically ablate key signaling molecules, and test effects on the repertoires
of ectopic mTEC subtypes and PTA transcripts, as well as T-cell tolerization to the “inflammatory self.”"
10833571,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Complex vascular diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), and coronary
artery calcification (CAC) pose considerable public health burden worldwide and involve both genetic and
environmental risk factors over a lifetime. Given the rising prevalence of vascular diseases across human
populations, there is an urgent need for new treatments and preventative measures that target the primary
disease processes in the vessel wall. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of
genetic loci associated with vascular disease risk. Large-scale functional genomic studies have begun to
resolve many of the causal genes, variants, and pathways at these loci and demonstrated shared genetic
etiologies. However, it still remains a challenge to translate these genetic discoveries into biologically and
clinically relevant insights. More than half of the CAD/MI loci are associated independently of classical risk
factors and may point to vascular dysfunction. Our group and others have adopted a systems-based approach
to prioritize the genes and mechanisms altered by disease risk loci in human coronary artery smooth muscle
cells (SMC). SMC normally regulate vascular tone but play critical roles in atherosclerosis as their contractile
gene program is hijacked during phenotypic switching to immune cell, fibroblast-like, and osteoblast-like cells.
Using multi-omics and quantitative trait locus mapping in human coronary artery SMC and tissues we recently
identified candidate causal genes and mechanisms for CAD-related vascular dysfunction. Single-cell analyses
of human coronary lesions demonstrated a critical role for CAD-associated transcription factors (e.g. TCF21) in
regulating SMC phenotypic switching during atherosclerosis. Using single-cell epigenomic profiling of coronary
arteries (n=41) we also identified novel SMC specific transcriptional regulators that are associated with multiple
vascular diseases. Integrative fine-mapping analyses prioritized Four-and-a-Half LIM domains 5 (FHL5) as a
causal gene for CAD/MI and subclinical vascular diseases. Interestingly, FHL5 overexpression decreased
SMC contractility, and increased proliferation and calcification, consistent with the genetic association for CAC.
Finally, FHL5 chromatin and transcriptome profiling in SMC support its role as a transcriptional cofactor, by
altering SMC contractility and extracellular matrix expression/regulation. These data suggest that elucidating its
trans-regulatory pathways may resolve mechanisms of pleiotropic risk across these conditions. Herein, we plan
to perform functional genomic studies of FHL5 in both human vascular cells and arteries ex vivo to determine
its role in vascular dysfunction, through altered actin cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix regulation, and
vasoreactivity. We will further reveal its target binding regions, protein interactomes, and construct multi-omic
gene regulatory networks to determine the effects of the FHL5 regulome on subclinical and advanced disease
outcomes. Together these studies will reveal key regulatory cascades and biomarkers for multiple vascular
conditions and inform novel early treatment or prevention strategies to eradicate these debilitating diseases."
10836668,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Globally, new HIV infections are concentrated in eastern and southern Africa where they are largely acquired
by women outside of known key populations. Identifying African women at high risk for HIV acquisition and
successfully engaging them in HIV prevention services, particularly pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
programs, is an urgent global health priority. The U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief program in
Africa typically relies on self-reported risk screening tools (SRST) to target HIV testing and refer individuals for
PrEP. However, these tools have low to moderate sensitivity, missing many women at high risk for HIV. This is
partly due to underreporting of risk factors, but also because many African women are at heightened HIV risk
solely through relationships with high-risk male partners. Moreover, many African women enrolled into PrEP
programs stop using PrEP within months of initiation. Decades of research shows that curable sexually
transmitted infections (cSTI) are objective markers of future HIV risk, but cSTI testing largely has been omitted
from African HIV programs. With the advent of lower cost multiplex cSTI testing and point of care diagnostics,
there is new opportunity to determine whether integrating female cSTI testing services into HIV programs can
improve HIV epidemic control. Here, we propose an individually randomized effectiveness implementation trial
of SRST plus cSTI diagnostic testing for chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomonas, and syphilis compared to SRST
alone to increase PrEP use among cis-gender African women aged 15-39 years. We hypothesize that cSTI
testing will increase PrEP use primarily through (i) improved identification of women at high risk for HIV and (ii)
enhancement of self-perceived HIV risk. The proposed research will be nested within the Rakai Community
Cohort Study, a population-based HIV surveillance cohort in Uganda. In Aim 1, ~4,500 HIV-negative women
will be individually randomized 1:1 to PrEP screening based on SRST plus cSTI diagnostic testing
(intervention) versus PrEP screening based on SRST alone (control arm). Both arms will be offered syndromic
case management for cSTIs and syphilis testing for pregnant women (standard of care). The primary outcomes
will be PrEP uptake, adherence, and persistence, assessed through clinical records and drug level testing. In
Aim 2, we will perform a mixed-methods, implementation science evaluation of female cSTI testing for HIV
prevention and control. We will use qualitative and quantitative methods to assess the mechanisms, barriers,
and facilitators to improving PrEP outcomes through cSTI testing and how this varies by cSTI pathogen, SRST
outcomes, and demographic profiles. In Aim 3, we will use mathematical models to evaluate different cSTI
testing approaches to reduce HIV incidence at a population level by considering what cSTIs to screen for, in
what health care settings, and at what cost thresholds. We will also model broader health benefits of cSTI
testing. Results from this study will provide actionable, population-level information to inform strategic delivery
of high impact HIV prevention through integrated HIV and cSTI programming in Africa."
10837607,"SUMMARY – OVERALL
 While there is an urgent need for vaccines eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against the highly
mutable HIV-1 retrovirus to stem its global spread, this goal remains elusive. Antibodies produced against
trimeric gp160 sites of vulnerability during natural infection drive retroviral mutation further, diversifying quasi-
species in individuals. One apparent exception is the conserved membrane-proximal external region (MPER)
site, critical for hemifusion/fusion and which is stealth, largely immersed in lipid and only transiently revealed
during spontaneous ectodomain tilting. Liposome-arrayed MPER segments induce specific antibodies in mice
but without neutralizing activity, explained by the restricted antibody access to the native MPER residing in a
narrow “crawlspace” between the viral membrane below and the base of the gp120 and gp41 protomers of the
trimeric gp160 envelop. Biomaterial formulation of polymer “steric clouds” on liposomes or alternative origami-
based approaches on nanodiscs to limit access to the MPER, akin to that mandated by the trimer three-fold axis,
were technically cumbersome and confounded by the uncertainty of MPER topology. Our recent analysis of the
structure and dynamics of nanodisc-embedded trimeric HIV-1 spike protein provides compelling data for
alternative design. In addition, synthetic RNA lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulation technology obviates vaccine
challenges with hydrophobic proteins such as the MPER and adjacent transmembrane segment (MPER-TM).
This P01 comprises two projects. Project 1 shall determine the immunogenicity of RNA vaccines encoding
MPER-TM trimers fused to structurally suitable self-proteins to focus antibody responses against the conjoint
membrane arrayed viral MPER-TM, with the self-proteins imposing steric restriction comparable to that exerted
by the gp160 ectodomain on the native MPER. Serological, single B cell, recombinant mAb methods,
neutralization assays and Ig bioinformatic analyses are applied. Automated computational searches of the pdb
informed by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures and using RNA technology reveal
antigenicity and immunogenicity of construct design for planned immunization studies in normal as well as knock-
in mice harboring human Ig D3-3 and JH6 gene segments for long CDRH3 loop generation. Project 2 will perform
cryo-EM and X-ray crystallographic studies to compare existing and additional HIV-1 patient-derived bnAbs
obtained from biobanked serial samples (Osier, IAVI) with those that are vaccine elicited, in the context of
nanodisc-arrayed MPER immunogens and native spike protein. We shall investigate Ig requirements of somatic
hypermutation (SHM), Fab molecular dynamics (MD) and co-evolution of antibody approach angles and affinities
of bnAbs of IgG1 and IgG3 isotypes. Projects 1 & 2 shall be performed by Kim/Weissman (DFCI/UPenn) and
Reinherz (DFCI), respectively, with four Technology Components: mRNA-LNP vaccine synthesis by Weissman
(U Penn); cryo-EM by Walz (Rockefeller), X-ray crystallography by Tan (APS) and Kwong (NIH); and MD by
Huang (Texas A&M). Administrative (Reinherz) and Antibody (Seaman, BIDMC) Cores serve all."
10837780,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Disparities in alcohol and other substance (AOD) use and misuse are well documented between sexual
minority adolescents (SMA) and their heterosexual peers. SMA of color also have higher rates of AOD use and
misuse than heterosexual peers of the same race/ethnicity and to some extent their White SMA peers. Daily
stigma and discrimination-related stressors specific to their marginalized identities (i.e., minority stressors,
racism-based stressors) contribute to health disparities among SMA of color. These stressors occur at the
interpersonal level (e.g., discrimination) and are reinforced at the structural level (e.g., anti-gay laws, or racist
institutional policies). Minority stress at a single axis of identity is directly correlated with AOD use and misuse
among sexual and racial/ethnic minority populations. Similarly, structural oppression (i.e., structural
heterosexism or racism) during adolescence has long-lasting health effects, including AOD use and misuse.
However, this work rarely takes an intersectional lens that considers both sexual orientation and race/ethnicity.
Although mounting cross-sectional and recent but limited longitudinal evidence implicates minority stress as a
key contributor to disparities in AOD use and misuse, the prospective, daily, and chronic impact of these
stressors on SMA of color's AOD use and misuse across adolescence is largely unknown. There is also a lack
of research examining the impact of structural oppression on SMA of color's AOD use, how it may play a key
etiological role in accelerating the progression of AOD use and misuse over adolescence, and how it may
impact the long-term and daily associations between intersectional minority stress and AOD use and misuse in
SMA of color's daily lives. In addition, little is known about protective factors between minority stress and AOD
use and misuse, which is needed to inform prevention and treatment interventions. Relying on our
investigator's team methodological, theoretical, analytic, and clinical expertise and pilot work, we propose a
rigorous and innovative study of intersectional stress and structural oppression and how they relate to AOD
use and misuse among SMA of color. Using a measurement-burst design, a combination of longitudinal and
daily diary methods, our aims are to: 1) test the prospective associations between intersectional stress and
structural oppression and AOD use and misuse among a national sample of SMA of color over 2.5 years
(N=950) with 6-month time-points; 2) test the daily associations between within-person fluctuations of
intersectional stress and AOD craving, use, misuse, and problems among the sample over 10-days at each 6-
month time point; 3) test protective and risk factors that attenuate or exacerbate the associations between
intersectional stress and AOD use and misuse over adolescence across the 2.5 years and in daily life. The
results will allow for more precise understanding of minority stress, structural oppression, and AOD use and
misuse in this population and inform clinical assessment and the development of culturally sensitive
interventions for SMA of color."
10840382,"ABSTRACT
It is fundamentally important to understand how functional information is encoded by a genome. Characterizing
these functional elements can bring novel mechanistic insights into biological processes ranging from normal
development to disease progression. I developed a computational algorithm to analyze ribosome profiling data,
and unexpectedly revealed thousands of short open reading frames (sORFs) encoded by putative ‘noncoding’
regions, including lncRNAs, pseudogenes, and 5’UTRs. Some of the sORFs are conserved across species,
suggesting biological importance. My results together with several other genetic studies in model species have
opened up a research frontier to study the biological roles of sORFs encoded in a genome. Here I propose to
use integrated computational and experimental genomics approaches to systematically characterize biological
functions of sORFs. First, we will study basic principles driving sORF conservation and expression across
eukaryotes. Second, we will study the stability and degradation pathways of sORF-encoded micropeptides. Third,
we will examine the importance of sORFs for regulating cell proliferation. Finally, we will study the functional
roles of sORF translation in regulating RNA stability. Taken together, our study will shed light on the functional
characterization of the newly identified translated regions in a genome and provide novel insights into the
interplay between RNA translation and genome evolution. Our findings will have far-reaching implications for the
molecular understanding of translational control and peptide functions underlying development and diseases."
10840447,"Our recent advances in the use of fluorescent fitness reporter Mtb strains in the murine TB model has afforded
us a unique appreciation of the role of macrophage lineages in both the control and promotion of Mtb growth.
Moreover, the extension of these observations through the successful development of Dual RNA-seq protocols
for characterization of infected cells isolated directly from the murine lung has provided a further understanding
of how host nutritional immunity is central to the control of bacterial growth, at least in early infection.
 We propose building on our collaboration with Dr. Henry Mwandumba in Malawi and extending these
observations through an ex vivo Mtb challenge model with human bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells to
functionally phenotype the macrophage lineages present in the human lung airways. Furthermore, we recently
demonstrated the persistence of transcriptionally-active HIV-1 genomes in the alveolar macrophages of ART-
naïve and ART-suppressed donors in Malawi and believe that we can take advantage of this unique human
subjects cohort to characterize the impairment of lung immunity known to occur in people living with HIV-1 that
renders them hypersusceptible to both TB and other lower respiratory tract infections.
 Our hypothesis is that the functional and phenotypic typing of Mtb-infected human lung macrophage
subsets from healthy and HIV-1-infected volunteers will generate testable models for immune-mediated control
of Mtb growth that will inform future vaccine development programs.
Specific Aim 1: Assessment of anti-Mtb immune function in a BAL ex vivo challenge model. This aim will
be overseen by Dr. Mwandumba in Malawi. We will use our fluorescent readouts of bacterial fitness to quantify
and optimize anti-microbial activities in human BAL cell cultures from HIV-1 uninfected and infected donors
challenged with Mtb ex vivo.
Specific Aim 2. Utilization of SILAC labeling and single cell RNA-seq to identify soluble modulators of
Mtb host macrophage function in HIV-1 negative and HIV-1 positive donors. This aim will be overseen by
Dr. Russell at Cornell University on human macrophages and BAL samples from Malawi. We will perform (i)
Proteomic analysis of released effector proteins by metabolic labeling studies (SILAC) of secreted proteins from
human BAL cells pulsed ex vivo in Malawi. (ii) We will perform single cell (scRNA-seq) RNA-seq analysis of
Mtb-challenged BAL cell populations from HIV-1 uninfected and infected donors to identify macrophage-
dependent pathways of immune control of Mtb growth and their impairment by HIV-1.
Specific Aim 3. The use of Loss of function and Gain of function approaches to assess candidate genes
and pathways in successful control of intracellular Mtb infection. We will use siRNA and synthetic mRNA
to manipulate host HMDMs and BAL macrophages to validate candidate genes/pathways involved in restriction
of bacterial growth, and how it is compromised in the HIV-1 lung environment."
10840334,"60 million people are enrolled in Medicare and 75 million in Medicaid, making these programs among the
most influential in the US health care system. Through them, federal and state governments regularly
experiment with new models of payment and delivery, trying out policy ideas on millions of beneficiaries. A
key laboratory for this experimentation is the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (the Innovation
Center), which has recently committed to “make equity a centerpiece of every model.”
New payment and delivery models may either widen disparities (e.g., through inadequate risk adjustment and
selection), ameliorate them (e.g., by addressing social determinants of health with flexible reimbursement), or
both (across different outcomes and subgroups). However, existing methods are not well suited to estimate
these programs' impacts on health equity.
Medicare and Medicaid programs and policies, because they are rarely randomized, are evaluated using
observational causal inference methods. One popular such method is difference-in-differences (diff-in-diff),
which compares changes in outcomes for people exposed to a new model versus changes over the same time
in a comparison group of people not exposed to the model. While useful for overall program impacts,
standard diff-in-diff methods are not suited to equity evaluations. The target estimands are not formulated
for equity questions, they do not accommodate varying responses across subgroups, and they do not account
for variation in treatment effects. In addition, the methods are not grounded in frameworks for health equity
and thus fail to use causal assumptions tailored for groups who experience disproportionate disadvantage.
Partly because of these methodological shortcomings, existing evidence on equity impacts of Medicare
alternative payment models is sparse and mixed. Primary care transformation models have received even less
attention. We propose to develop and apply novel methods to study how Comprehensive Primary Care Plus
(CPC+) affects health care for Black Medicare beneficiaries. This national advanced primary care medical
home model was introduced across 18 regions in 2017-18 and will continue through 2021. Our specific aims
are 1) To estimate impacts of CPC+ on health care and health equity for Black Medicare beneficiaries, 2) To
estimate variation in responses to CPC+ within subgroups of Black Medicare beneficiaries with intersecting
identities of gender, disability, and dual eligibility for Medicaid, and 3) To explore variation in responses to
CPC+ across two contextual dimensions: primary care practice characteristics and the local health care and
socioeconomic environment. This application is in response to NOT-HS-21-014 Special Emphasis Notice

10840430,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune-modulating therapies have been revolutionary treatments for several cancer types including melanoma,
lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma. However, most cancer patients do not respond to immunotherapies, and
there remains a critical need to identify alternative approaches to treating these cancers. Endogenous
retroviruses (ERVs) are genetic remnants of retroviral infection transmitted vertically through generations, whose
transcription can result in type-I interferon activation, and/or presentation of ERV-associated antigens. Recent
studies on ERVs in human cancer has shown that ERV expression can render cells immunogenic in a variety of
cancer types including colorectal, breast cancer and melanoma. Therefore, characterization of how ERV
expression is regulated in cancer will reveal opportunities to therapeutically de-repress ERVs and improve
immunotherapy outcomes in low antigen tumors.
In the F99-phase of this proposal, I will investigate the role of epigenetic factors regulating ERV expression and
anti-tumor immunity in melanoma. Specifically, I will test melanoma tumors for ERV tetramer-positive CD8+ T
cells, to determine the antigenicity of de-repressed melanoma ERVs. Furthermore, I will determine the
mechanism by which type-I interferon response is induced in epigenetically-modified tumors, and determine the
role of ERV MHC-I antigens through genetic knockouts of each component and evaluating tumor growth and
immunogenicity. This work will establish the mechanism by which ERVs are regulated epigenetically, and
establish a framework for investigating ERV regulation and its impact on the immune response to cancer.
In the K00-phase of this proposal, I will harness my experience studying ERVs to investigate their utility in
improving the immune response to antigen-low tumor types. Specifically, I will perform a CRISPR screen to
identify druggable regulators of HERV expression in human cancer cell lines. I will then validate these candidate
regulators by pharmacologically targeting them and testing the induction of type-I interferon and antigenic
responses in these cells. Finally, I will evaluate whether ERV-specific CAR-T cells can react to ERV-induced
cells in vivo.
This proposed research will clarify the mechanisms by which ERVs are epigenetically regulated in cancer, and
identify novel and actionable targets for re-expressing ERVs in difficult-to-treat tumor types. This will lead to
improved immunotherapeutic strategies for treating cancers with poor patient outcomes."

The Developmental Research Project Program (DRPP) of the Wyoming INBRE will carry out the central function 
of allocating funds to support biomedical research throughout the Wyoming network including the University of 
Wyoming (UW) and the state’s 7 community colleges. The DRPP will manage internal grant competitions in the 
INBRE-4 thematic areas of (1) Cell and Molecular Biology and (2) Methods for Chronic Disease Research and 
Therapies. These themes are a natural outgrowth of INBRE-3 focus areas and are designed to capture the 
widest possible field of active biomedical researchers within the Wyoming network. Other keys functions of the 
DRPP will be to oversee the advising and mentoring of supported faculty, to monitor progression toward project 
goals and funding independence, and to ensure standards of compliance. In carrying out its functions the DRPP 
will continue to work closely with the Administrative Core, Bioinformatics Core, and INBRE Student Programs. 
Since the start of INBRE-3 (2015–present), the DRPP has allocated $3M, or 95% of its total budget, to support 
45 different research projects within the Wyoming network. This includes Thematic and Pilot grants, which are 
used to support research-intensive faculty at UW. A key litmus test for Pilot and Thematic projects is that they 
must have the potential to be developed into independent R-type or similar awards. In addition, 10% of Thematic 
and Pilot awards are used to promote UW–community college interactions, thus strengthening the network. The 
DRPP also funds Collaborative grants, which support extensive scientific collaborations between UW and 
community college investigators. Collaborative projects emphasize student training and network development 
but also encourage the publication of results. During INBRE-4, the DRPP will continue to work with the 
Administration Core to allocate graduate assistantships and shared equipment grants, as well as other 
initiatives. Our central aims will be to: (1) Collaborate with other INBRE cores to support biomedical research 
projects, training opportunities, and critical infrastructure throughout the Wyoming network; (2) Administer a fair 
and rigorous system for the evaluation of INBRE research and training proposals; (3) Ensure appropriate 
advising, oversight, and assessment for faculty and students engaged in Wyoming INBRE projects; and (4) 
Promote inter-institutional biomedical research, training, and interactions within the Wyoming network and 
western region of the Regional Alliance of INBRE Networks. These goals are supported by a strong foundation 
laid during INBRE-3, which included the rigorous external review of Pilot and Thematic awards. In addition, 
during INBRE-3 the DRPP introduced five new training initiatives including (1) Faculty Chalk Talks, (2) External 
Consulting, and (3) Grant and Manuscript Editing. During INBRE-4 we will continue with these successfully 
reviewed activities and further enhance our efforts to aid faculty with grantsmanship and publication output. A

10850784,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Animals routinely operate in complex environments rich in sensory stimuli. They handle this informational
complexity by having their behavior guided by the most salient (and more generally, highest priority) stimulus in
the environment. The neural circuit mechanisms underlying competitive selection of the highest priority stimulus
across space remain poorly understood. Recent evidence from behaving monkeys has revealed that the
intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus (SCid), a major sensorimotor hub in the vertebrate
midbrain, are required for normal competitive stimulus selection. In parallel, our work in the barn owl optic tectum
(OTid, avian homolog of SCid) has revealed that OTid neurons signal the highest priority stimulus categorically,
which can account for SCid’s critical role in spatial selection behavior. Such categorical signaling requires a
specialized, donut-like pattern of spatial inhibition onto OTid from an inhibitory nucleus called Imc in the nearby
midbrain isthmic complex. Separately, feedback from a cholinergic isthmic nucleus, Ipc, is known to amplify OTid
firing rates. Despite these insights, several fundamental questions about the functional logic of this isthmo-tectal
(OT-Imc-Ipc) network for competitive stimulus selection remain open, and here, we address three. First, we aim
to elucidate how the preferential neural signaling of the most salient stimulus is implemented in OTid. Specifically,
our hypotheses are (1a) that OTid signals the strongest among competing stimuli with a combination of enhanced
gamma synchrony, reduced trial-trial variability, greater resistance to adaptation, and reduced noise correlations
(rather than just with elevated firing rates), and (1b) that cholinergic Ipc serves as a multiplexed mechanism for
regulating these diverse OTid coding features. Second, we aim to elucidate a neuromodulatory mechanism for
the control of categorization. Our hypotheses (based on our model predictions) are (2a) that (hitherto
uncharacterized) spatially-specific cholinergic input onto Imc neurons causes multiplicative modulation of Imc
activity, and (2b) that it serves as a mechanism to enhance the degree of categorical signaling of the most salient
stimulus by OTid. Third, we aim to uncover the source and broader functional logic of this cholinergic input. Our
hypotheses are (3a) that Ipc is the dominant source of cholinergic input onto Imc neurons, and (3b) that in
parallel, Ipc, which influences activity across the layers of the OT, selectively spares the OT layer that provides
input to it (layer 10); revealing a precisely organized circuit design that minimizes runaway feedback excitation
in this network. We will test these hypotheses using in vivo electrophysiology and drug iontophoresis during
visual stimulus presentation in awake, head-fixed barn owls, together with computational modeling. Preliminary
data from the three aims support our hypotheses. Results from the proposed work have the power to reveal
fundamental neural circuit mechanisms involving multiple neurotransmitter systems for executing the
sophisticated computations that underlie stimulus competition and spatial selection across space."
10850785,"SUMMARY: Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric conditions, yet no new anxiolytic drug has
been approved for treatment in the last decade. Therefore, there is a significant unmet need to develop new
effective pharmacotherapies. In rodent and human studies, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) has
emerged as a key brain region translating prolonged exposure to uncertain threats into sustained fear. The
BNST is hyperactive in patients suffering from anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. Human
imaging studies demonstrate an enhanced functional connectivity between the BNST and the central amygdala
(CeA) in anxious individuals. In rats, the BNST sends inhibitory projection to the CeA (BNSTàCeA) but there
is a significant knowledge gap on how the BNST interacts with the CeA to modulate fear processing. As the
CeA and BNST drive fear responses to predictable and unpredictable threats, respectively, increased activity
of the BNSTàCeA neurons will favor responses to the unpredictable threats and can precipitate
hypervigilance, an important hallmark of anxiety disorders in humans. Therefore, the factors that inhibit this
BNSTàCeA output have untapped potential as novel therapeutic targets. Recent findings from the lab show
that one such target involves oxytocin receptors (OTR) in the BNST, as OTR activation inhibits BNSTàCeA
output and facilitates fear to predictable threats (cued fear). In contrast, our compelling preliminary data
indicate that activation of vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) in the BNST directly excites Type III/Corticotropin-
releasing factor (CRF) neurons, which promote sustained fear responses. Based on this scientific premise, the
central hypothesis of this proposal is that by inhibiting and exciting the BNSTàCeA neurons, OTR and V1aR
facilitate fear responses to predictable vs. unpredictable threats, respectively. This innovative concept will be
investigated using cutting-edge experimental approaches, including chemogenetic and optogenetic
manipulations of BNSTàCeA neurons in recently developed transgenic rat models (OTR-Cre, AVP-Cre, CRF-
Cre). Rigorously designed behavioral and electrophysiological experiments will test the hypothesis with the
following specific aims: 1) Determine the integrated role of V1aR and OTR in modulating activity of BNST
neurons, 2) Determine whether predictable vs. unpredictable threats differentially modulate activity of
BNSTàCeA neurons via OTR and V1aR, 3) Determine the role of BNSTàCeA neurons in mediating fear
responses to predictable vs. unpredictable threats, and the contribution of OTR vs. V1aR. By refining
mechanisms underlying the activity of BNSTàCeA neurons, this proposal will have a positive impact on the
understanding how an imbalance in processing of predictable vs. unpredictable threats can lead to a
hypervigilance and precipitate the onset of anxiety disorders."
10850786,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The University of Oregon's long-standing predoctoral Developmental Biology Training Program's goal is to
train rigorous, skilled, and innovative developmental biologists. Our trainees develop abilities to lead research
programs of their own, communicate discoveries to other scientists and the public, and teach future
generations of scientists. Our multi-faceted training equips students to become leading academic and non-
academic scientists or achieve other influential research-related careers.
Individualized research training within one of many active and diverse laboratories is the core of our program.
Trainees' thesis research builds upon a continuously innovating curricular foundation. Core graduate-level
courses are Molecular Genetics and Developmental Genetics and one of Developmental Neurobiology, Stem
Cells & Regeneration, and Genomics Approaches. Additionally, all trainees take Advanced Biological
Statistics. We surround research and coursework with a wealth of enhancing and broadening experiences.
Examples include first year rotations, required teaching, a dissertation advisory committee, journal clubs, a
monthly interest group, annual student research reports, and interactions with visiting speakers. We offer
various career development activities especially to support students interested in non-academic careers. A
unique highlight is our annual trainee-organized Developmental Biology Training Program symposium, where
trainees host leading scientists to share their research on a topic of the students' choosing.
We request continued support for seven predoctoral positions within a program that includes 22 highly
collaborative, productive, and well-funded labs dedicated to graduate training. We have expanded the reach
and vitality of our research and training with six new Assistant Professors, all of whom are top recruits and
represent diverse areas of developmental biology research. They join the DBTP's internationally respected
senior faculty to position us to maintain our outsized record of innovative research and training. The DBTP
unites faculty and trainees from two Departments (Biology or Chemistry & Biochemistry) and four Institutes
(Institute of Molecular Biology, Institute of Neuroscience, Institute of Ecology and Evolution, Oregon Institute of
Marine Biology). Trainees are exposed to research across Institutes due to a rich tradition of collaboration,
common training activities, the close proximity of most labs, and outstanding core facilities. As such, our
program fosters interdisciplinary training that bridges genetics, genomics, molecular biology, cell biology,
computational biology, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology. This breadth complements the focused project-
oriented training students receive in their thesis labs, producing creative and confident scientists empowered to
direct impactful research programs or assume other science leadership roles."
10850892,"Project Summary / Abstract
This is a patient-oriented career development proposal designed to provide the candidate with advanced
training, protected research time, and mentored research experience. The research aims focus on Borderline
Personality Disorder (BPD), which is a serious and debilitating mental illness that affects 2-6% of the
population and increases risk of suicide. Current treatments have limited efficacy and there are no FDA-
approved medications for BPD. The candidate's long-term career goal is to improve the treatment of BPD and
other disorders with significant social symptoms by using computational psychiatry to better predict prognosis
and best treatment match.
To continue her progress toward this goal, the candidate proposes a detailed plan for training, including expert
mentorship and three supervised research aims. The training plan is designed for the candidate to gain
expertise in neuroimaging, computational modelling, and learning theory. The candidate will also build on her
strong foundation in clinical research and treatment of people with Borderline Personality Disorder and in
statistical approaches to data analysis. The mentorship team has extensive expertise in clinical psychiatry
research, fMRI study design and analysis, and computational modelling of learning. They will provide the
candidate with the resources and supervision needed to advance toward her research goals.
These studies leverage recent advances in computational psychiatry. Through three hypothesis-driven
research aims, subject behavior and brain activation will be tested during an interactive social learning task.
These aims test learning under volatility (when the environment is unpredictable) in BPD compared to
BPD+PTSD, PTSD, and trauma-exposed healthy controls. Aim 1 tests the role of anterior cingulate cortex for
signaling volatility, and interaction between amygdala and anterior cingulate in this setting. Aim 2 tests
learning patterns in BPD versus comparator subjects to identify illness-specific phenotypes. Aim 3 tests how
neural and behavioral markers of learning relate to social functioning. Next steps will be to refine a
computational model of learning in BPD to predict prognosis, predict best treatment match for an individual,
and test novel biological treatment targets.
Improving our mechanistic understanding of interpersonal symptoms will improve our clinical treatments and
significantly reduce suffering for millions of people with BPD and their families."
10854752,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Clinical Core
 The Clinical Core (CC) is an integral part of the LJI HIPC Program. The Core provides leadership and
management of all clinical samples and data. This includes ensuring all regulatory documentation is in place for
human subjects research both at LJI and at collaborators' institutions, appropriate training of personnel and
monitoring all clinical study activities of the HIPC center, managing oversight of internal and external sample
collection which includes arranging for regular shipments of samples to LJI, sample storage, clinical data
collection, oversight in our specialized donor record administrative system DoRAS, and QC of received samples.
The CC ensures that HLA typing is performed on all samples that require it, as well as ensuring it works with the
Projects, Sequencing, and Data Management and Analysis Cores to confirm sample integrity and identity
throughout the experimental and bioinformatics pipeline process.
 The overall scientific program will develop a series of immune signatures for antigen-specific T cells
responding to a diverse range of respiratory pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, common cold coronaviruses,
influenza, tuberculosis, pneumococcus, pertussis, and fungi (aspergillus and candida). The success of the entire
program is contingent upon successful accrual of high-quality human samples and the associated donor
information. Obtaining such samples in sufficient quantity and quality presents specific challenges, because of
the proposal's focus on comparison of T cells reactive to different respiratory pathogens, and enrollment of
individuals from several, very different, geographical locations. To address these challenges, the CC will use
well-developed and validated methods to procure samples (including PBMC, lung tissue, and BAL) from cohorts
associated with natural infection, ongoing disease, and vaccination. The cohorts to be used for this program will
be obtained from either our well-established in-house LJI Center for Clinical Investigation (CCI) or our
experienced collaborators and clinicians that have access to unique cohorts and with whom we have enjoyed
fruitful relationships over many years. We are confident in our ability to provide the necessary samples as well
as clinical and scientific input to enable the most robust and compelling studies. We will continue recruitment
and sample acquisition of already established cohorts, and access previously obtained samples in the context
of the SARS-CoV-2 project (Project 1). In addition, we have established long-standing relationships with Drs.
Dharshan DeSilva (Sri Lanka), Matt O'Shea (UK), Maria Lerm (Sweden), Cesar Ugarte (Peru), and Richard
Silver (USA) that will provide longitudinal samples from subjects with latent TB infection or who are diagnosed
with active TB, and from subjects undergoing BCG vaccination (Project 2). The CC will provide lung tissue and
bronchoalveolar lavage specimens (BAL) from patients undergoing lung surgery for clinical indications by closely
collaborating with Christian Ottensmeier (UK; Project 3)."
10854759,"Project Summary: Project 2
Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and is a leading
cause of death from a single infectious agent worldwide. Here we will characterize immune signatures (IMS) of
Mtb antigen-specific CD4 T cells in individuals with different states of Mtb infection and BCG vaccination.
Specifically, we will utilize our established Mtb peptide epitope pools and assay systems to identify antigen-
specific CD4 T cells and their T cell receptors (TCRs). The IMS will be further characterized in cytometry and
single-cell RNA-seq assays after antigen stimulation and ex vivo. For Aim 1, we will enroll cohorts of individuals
with active tuberculosis (ATB), characterized by uncontrolled symptomatic Mtb infection, who will be receiving
anti-TB therapy. We will longitudinally track the IMS over the course of treatment, and identify markers
predictive of treatment outcomes. For Aim 2, we will enroll individuals with ‘latent’ TB infection (LTBI), which is
characterized by immune reactivity to Mtb but no symptoms of disease (i.e. Mtb reactive). LTBI is
heterogeneous, consisting both of individuals who have successfully cleared their infection and display a
memory immune response, as well as others with subclinical infection at increased risk of developing active
disease. There is currently no test available to distinguish subclinical from cleared infection. We will determine
the IMS in prophylactically-treated LTBI longitudinally, and determine who displays a treatment response most
similar to ATB, which we consider most likely to have had subclinical disease. For a separate cohort of LTBI,
we will utilize a unique human challenge model to obtain samples with antigen-specific resident T cells from
the lung and use them to evaluate overlap and differences between the IMS in the blood vs. lung from the same
set of individuals. For Aim 3, we will obtain samples taken pre- and post-BCG (re)vaccination in adults to
characterize the vaccine induced IMS. Revaccination of Mtb uninfected adults has been shown to be protective
from disease, thus, comparing this IMS with that in LTBI (controlled infection) vs. ATB (uncontrolled infection)
can reveal protective components of vaccine induced immunity."
10854761,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 La Jolla HIPC team will focus on common pathogens causing infectious diseases of the respiratory tract.
Here in Project 3, we will determine the molecular properties of lung tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM cells)
that are specific to a wide-range of viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens. Our goal is to establish a single-cell
atlas of the transcriptome, epigenome and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of pathogen-reactive lung TRM cells.
In Aim 1, we will perform single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and TCR-seq analysis of T cells isolated from lung
tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of 100 living donors, who undergo surgical resection for suspected
early-stage lung cancer (TARGET Lung study). We will utilize their TCR sequences to determine the pathogen-
specificity of lung TRM cells. To achieve this goal, we will generate a catalogue of experimentally-validated TCR
sequences that are specific to different pathogen epitopes and HLA-typed donors; we will achieve this goal by
stimulating PBMCs of matched donors with peptide pools targeting specific pathogens that infects the lungs such
as: viral (Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, para influenza, meta pneumovirus, SARS-CoV-2, common cold
corona virus), bacterial (pneumococcus, pertussis, mycobacterium) and fungal (aspergillus and candida)
pathogens, and retrieve TCR sequences of responding T cells. Longitudinal assessments: To assess
persistence and plasticity of pathogen-specific lung TRM cells, in a subgroup of donors (n~25-50), we will obtain
BAL samples 1 year after initial assessments and perform single-cell analysis as above. In Aim 2, we will define
the molecular properties of human lung T cells responding to vaccination (n=100). In 100 donors (TARGET Lung
study), we will assess effects of 4 different vaccines (n=25/vaccine cohort): (i) inactivated influenza vaccine, (ii)
pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23), (iii) SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, (iv) Pertussis vaccine (Boostrix-IPV). We will
compare the molecular features of circulating and lung T cells (TRM cells) that respond to vaccines targeting
different pathogens. In addition, we will determine if vaccine-responding T cells in the blood truly reflect TRM
responses in the lung tissue. Longitudinal assessments: We will also collect repeat blood and BAL samples,
obtained by research bronchoscopy, 12 months after vaccination. We will determine the magnitude and
phenotype of vaccine-responsive T cells in the blood and lungs to assess their persistence and plasticity. We
have extensive synergies with Project 1 and 2, especially the focus on generating immune signatures of various
respiratory pathogen-specific T cells."

 The Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) will continue to provide centralized data management
and analysis services for the LJI HIPC center projects and cores, as it has successfully done since the inception
of the HIPC Program at LJI in 2015. Further, the DMAC will ensure the ongoing timely submission of data and
data analyses obtained under this award to the ImmPort database and other repositories identified by NIAID.
 For centralized data management, we will utilize our in-house, data management system of
interconnected databases and analysis scripts. This is centered around the Donor Record Administration System
(DoRAS) for tracking donors and samples along with clinical information. Here we will extend DoRAS to ensure
that all clinical information relevant to the present proposal can be captured. The database will be accessible
through the internet and provide a consistent basis to select samples and interpret results. All information in
DoRAS is de-identified, so that research projects will not have access to sensitive information, allowing data to
be freely shared.
 In terms of data analysis services, the DMAC will build on the procedures established successfully in the
last 6 years and provide a set of automated analysis pipelines that take data generated in each Project and
provide standardized analyses that will facilitate inter-project comparisons and reproducibility. Pipelines for bulk
RNA-seq have already been fully implemented including user friendly web reports for the generated results.
Initial pipelines for single-cell- RNA-seq analysis have been established, and will continue to be optimized. For
high-dimensional cytometry analysis as generated by flow or mass-cytometry, we will be using a combination
of traditional manual gating approaches and directed automated gating methods, in particularly Directed
Automated Filtering and Identification of cell populations (DAFI)1, which was developed in the previous funding
period. Also, we will optimize and automate a TCR-seq analysis pipeline that will identify TCRs in various
experimental settings. Power calculations will also be provided.
 To facilitate efficient data sharing with ImmPort, and to follow guidelines for data standards set by the
newly introduced HIPC Coordinating Center (HCC), we will take advantage of the fact that the data generated
through automated pipelines in this proposal is already in a standardized format, and ties back to the sample
and human subject information captured in DoRAS. Updates to data standards are easily implemented in these
pipelines, and will generate the desired export format for ImmPort, GEO or SRA. Additionally, DMAC will provide
dedicated staff with experience in data submissions to ensure that study specific data elements not covered by
the automated pipelines will be appropriately submitted. We have extensive experience and success with this
approach, as evidenced by our track record of submissions in the last funding period."

At present 6.7 million people in the US are living with Alzheimer’s disease and countless others are impacted
by age-related cognitive decline. The cost of care for these is skyrocketing. We urgently need to discover new
prevention and treatment strategies. To do this, we need to train the next generation of scientists in modern
techniques and in how to integrate findings across multiple domains and research approaches. UCI has a
long and distinguished history in the study of brain plasticity and learning and memory at multiple levels
and in integrating across levels and approaches. In addition, UCI has long and growing expertise in
neuroinflammation, stem cell biology and translational science, all of which are included in this training
program. However, new areas of strength have been developing and collaborations formed with enhanced
animal and human imaging, sleep researchers, cognitive sciences and clinical trials that is vital to real progress
in generating the capabilities to identify, treat and prevent/delay pathological decline in cognitive function. We
seek to provide pre- and postdoctoral trainees with training in concepts such as the integrative roles of
genetics and environment in brain aging and as a function of lifespan. Although a significant fraction of
research involves animal studies, we emphasize a broadened consideration of ""bridging the gap"" between
animal and human studies. Overall, our training program has six primary features and strengths: 1) A team of
innovative and scholarly preceptors who have a strong record of accomplishment for training young scholars;
2) An excellent collaborative environment; 3) A core set of courses on tailored to brain aging and dementia
research; 4) A set of seminars and symposia and training on brain pathology through Clinical-pathological case
presentations 5) Specific training in oral and written communication skills; and 6) Individual guidance and
mentoring to help trainees reach their career goals. Overall, our Training program in Neurobiology of Aging
and Alzheimer’s disease is designed to develop a uniquely trained cadre of investigators who over the years
will develop successful careers bench to clinic translation of research to improve the lives of the elderly and
ensure sustainably healthcare for the nation."
10849327,"Project Summary: Osteopetrosis is a heritable skeletal disorder characterized by abnormal systemic increase
in bone mass density, bone marrow failure, bone fractures, osteomyelitis, and impaired vision and hearing,
among other clinical features leading to physical disability and death of patients. Osteopetrosis can be caused
by mutations in the Clcn7 gene that result in defects in the function of osteoclasts (OCs), tissue resident cells of
the bone derived from hematopoietic progenitors and specialized in bone resorption. Bone marrow
transplantation (BMT), which replaces defective OCs and restores bone resorption is the only available treatment
for osteopetrosis despite knowing its etiology for decades. However, not all patients are eligible for BMT, depend
on HLA-match donors, and patients who receive BMT frequently suffer from severe complications including
toxicity of conditioning treatment, graft versus host disease (GVHD), among others, which results in high
transplant-related mortality. Alternative therapies for osteopetrosis have been reported that include genetic
therapy using retroviral infection for delivery, unfortunately clinical trials showed elevated incidence of vector-
induced hematological malignancies in these patients. Others have reported a therapeutic approach, currently
in clinical trials, that utilizes lentiviral infection in cells to provide with functional genes followed by transplantation,
however, this therapy requires conditioning treatment including irradiation or chemotherapy to achieve
engraftment of genetically modified cells.
In this grant, we proposed a novel alternative therapeutic strategy that combines CRISPR/Cas9-based genome
editing tools to correct osteopetrosis-causing Clcn7 mutations ex vivo in hematopoietic progenitors, followed by
autologous infusion of mutation-corrected cells into osteopetrotic mice to restore normal bone remodeling. This
novel approach overcomes the undesired long term and fatal consequences of BTM, since it does not require
HLA-match donors and conditioning treatment including irradiation or chemotherapy for cell engraftment. The
goal of this grant is to develop and establish standard protocols for the assessment, design, testing and validation
of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technologies that would offer individual patients with a mutation-specific and
cell-specific approach to treat osteopetrosis."

Program summary
Approximately 20% of all human cancers are associated with viruses that function as biological
cofactors driving these cancers. Some of these viruses may have a direct role in mediating these
cancers as in the case of HIV-related cancers, which includes Kaposi’s sarcoma, pleural effusion
lymphomas and lymphoproliferative disease. There is also an increase in the number of HPV-
related patients for example in the immunocompromised patients who are on HAART therapy and
in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. The Tumor Virology Training Program at the
University of Pennsylvania serves as the central forum for facilitating interactions among
investigators involved in cancer-related viral research on the Penn campus which provides a more
directed training for trainees. Program members have expertise in EBV, KSHV, HPV, HCV, HIV
and other retroviruses. The biomedical community at Penn would like to continue the momentum
of this training program in Tumor Virology for training predoctoral and postdoctoral students.
There are 21 trainers in this program all of whom are committed to training pre and postdoctoral
fellows for biomedical research careers. The faculty have well-funded NIH programs supported
by different NIH funding mechanisms, and other Government and private foundation funding. The
training program seeks to continue support of 2 predoctoral and 4 postdoctoral students, annually,
for each of the 5 years of funding. The number of trainees in labs of the trainers of this program
has been consistently increasing and we anticipate this trend continuing in the coming years.
Thus, we would like to have available slots for the continued increase in the number of predoctoral
and postdoctoral candidates available to the program. Viral related cancers are expected to
increase as the technology for identifying these agents improves. We continue to provide an
atmosphere of collaboration between clinical and basic scientists for our trainees who will have
the opportunity to formulate ideas which will lead to basic and translational studies initiating and
maintaining a cohesive group in tumor virology. The increased incidence of viral associated
cancers, the commitment of the trainers and the institution with a well-organized training program
will continue to provide an outstanding training environment for pre- and postdoctoral candidates
in tumor virology."
10850321,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disease caused by mutations in the gene NF1. Most
NF1 pediatric patients present with diverse neurological conditions, including learning disabilities, attention deficit
and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and motor skill issues. No specific treatments for these issues are available
and most patients perform poorly in school. Brain white matter (WM) and myelin abnormalities are commonly
observed in parallel with the peak of neurological conditions in NF1, yet no clear evidence can link abnormal
myelin and brain dysfunction in NF1. This represents a critical barrier to progress in the NF1 field. In contrast,
evidence of central roles for myelin in regulating learning and mood is rapidly increasing. Hence, this project’s
goal is to use the most recent information and tools on myelin biology to unveil specific impacts of Nf1 mutation
on oligodendrocyte (OL; brain myelinating cell) / myelin development and related brain dysfunction. Understand-
ing mechanisms for Nf1 mutation in mouse models will diversify therapeutic tools and schedules for NF1 treat-
ments. Indirect evidence suggests roles for Nf1 in every step of OL formation and myelin development, and our
preliminary results suggest transiently increased brain WM/myelin in infants with NF1. Moreover, life-long anal-
yses in Nf1+/- mice suggest hyperproliferation of OL precursors (OPCs) and increased OL production in postna-
tal development and, contrastingly, defective OPC proliferation in adults. Correlatively, juvenile Nf1+/- mice show
increased activity and learning in a myelin regulated motor skill test (complex wheel; CW), and impaired activ-
ity/learning in 1-year old Nf1+/- mice. These mice, however, have Nf1 mutated in every cell; thus, to unveil links
between Nf1-driven abnormal myelin biology and brain function we propose using myelin specific models. We
hypothesize that postnatally induced Nf1 mutation in OPCs increases their proliferation/differentiation, which
causes transient hyperactivity and improved learning curves of fine motor skills in the CW test. To test this idea,
we will use a tamoxifen inducible system to mutate Nf1 in mouse OPCs (nNf1). The Aim 1 will define the OL
lineage progression in nNf1 mice, Aim 2 will test nNf1 impact on CW activity and learning, and Aim 3 will assess
the rescue of phenotypes. Successful completion of these aims will help to settle a long-lasting debate on myelin-
behavior links in NF1. In the mid-term, results will help to propose therapeutic targets and windows of time for
interventions in NF1 patients. In line with NIH mission, this study will generate fundamental neuroscience
knowledge and promote reduction of the burden of neurological diseases, particularly of NF1 on pediatric pa-
tients. The PI’s expertise and research network in NF1, myelin biology, and mouse genetics will be essential for
the timely completion of the aims. Furthermore, this study involves direct participation of undergraduate minority-
in-science students and will produce data for high impact publications to achieve research excellence."

 In the past five years, under the support of the NIH R25 grant, we successfully developed a
comprehensive curriculum pathway for our undergraduate team-based biomedical engineering
(BME) capstone design courses. In this renewal proposal, we aim to improve the current
curriculum by developing new courses/programs and bringing new partners to the interdisciplinary
design teams, to enhance BME student skill development in biodesign, expand the team
perspective, and improve communication across disciplines. In the next project period, we aim to
achieve the following three goals: 1) Offer an enhanced biodesign curriculum to BME students,
by adding new healthcare topics, global components, a more diverse pool of healthcare mentors,
and a new course structure (i.e., the Vertically Integrated Projects Program), to the current
practice. 2) Develop a Healthcare Device Innovation (HDI) Microcredential Program. Three
courses will be developed for this microcredential program, covering various biodesign topics.
These new microcredential courses will be open to enrollment for not only BME undergraduate
students, but also all healthcare students and practicing healthcare providers within Stony Brook
University and Stony Brook University Hospital. BME undergraduate students will be able to take
these classes as technical electives. These courses will give BME students opportunities to work
directly with a variety of healthcare providers with expertise in general medicine, nursing, dental
medicine, clinical laboratory services, emergency medical services, radiology, occupational
therapy, physical therapy, and social welfare, etc. 3) Establish a new Biotechnology and
Entrepreneurship Internship Program, in collaboration with Center for Biotechnology, the
Intellectual Property Partners Office, and local biotech companies. This new internship program
will provide BME undergraduate students with experiential learning opportunities to observe (and
comprehend) the operational and business side of the biodesign process.
 We will recruit, retain and train a diverse group of students/participants in the proposed
educational programs. Quantitative and qualitative analyses will be conducted to assess and
evaluate the programs’ learning and teaching outcomes. The enhanced biodesign curriculum,
microcredential and internship programs will help BME students to learn how to work effectively
with various healthcare providers and other stakeholders during the biodesign process. All these
programs will help BME students to gain practical skills that are needed for the future
bioengineering workforce development."
10852825,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lower-extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis that affects
more than 236 million individuals worldwide. Patients with PAD have a worse quality of life (QOL) than their
healthy counterparts, due in part to the marked decline in physical functioning. Few non-invasive therapies
currently exist to improve functional performance and restore QOL in people with PAD. The goal of the
proposed experiments is to determine the benefits of home-based leg heat therapy (HT) on lower-extremity
functioning and QOL in patients with PAD. This novel approach consists of custom engineered trousers and a
portable water pump. Hot water is circulated through the trousers, evenly heating the buttocks, thighs and calf.
This system is safe and convenient for application in the home setting without supervision. We demonstrated
that repeated exposure to leg HT using these customized water-circulating trousers enhanced muscle strength
and capillarization and accelerated recovery following muscle damage in young, sedentary individuals. In a
preclinical model of PAD, we reported that HT via repeated lower-body immersion in a water bath enhanced
skeletal muscle mass and strength. Our first randomized sham-controlled trial in 32 patients with symptomatic
PAD revealed that supervised leg HT elicited a clinically meaningful improvement in perceived physical
functioning. Our recent R21-sponsored pilot study revealed that home-based, unsupervised leg HT is safe and
well-tolerated by symptomatic PAD patients. Building upon these extensive preliminary data, we propose to
conduct a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial in 110 patients with PAD to establish the
effect of daily home-based leg HT for 12 weeks on functional capacity and QOL. Patients randomized to the
leg HT group (n=55) will be asked to apply the treatment daily for 90 min using water-circulating trousers
perfused with water heated to 42ºC. In the sham group (n=55), water at 33ºC will be circulated through the
trousers. The primary study outcome is the change in 6-minute walk distance between baseline and the 12-
week follow up. Secondary outcomes include changes in leg strength and fatigability, changes in the short
physical performance battery score and changes in perceived QOL. In Aim #2, we will determine the tissue-
level mechanisms by which HT affects muscle strength and walking performance. We will assess skeletal
muscle morphology and blood flow using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biopsies from the calf
muscle. If the conclusions based on our preliminary data are substantiated, the proposed experiments will
provide an evidence-based framework of feasibility and efficacy of a novel, straightforward approach to
improve functional performance and QOL in patients with PAD. Given its accessibility, tolerability and ease of
use, HT has the potential for rapid translation and application in the clinical setting, thereby opening new
horizons for the non-invasive management of PAD.

10852929,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
While great strides have been made in reducing breast cancer mortality over the last two decades, most of this
reduction is attributed to advances in treatment. Screening’s contribution to breast cancer mortality reduction has
been stagnant as screening continues to rely on mammography’s x-ray technology that preferentially detects less
aggressive cancers and can mask tumors in dense breasts, due to the similar x-ray attenuation characteristics of
breast tumors and dense tissue. Over half of women who undergo screening in the US have mammographically
dense breasts (MDB), and mammography fails to detect 75% of cancers in women with MDB when it is compared
to a functional screening tool such as MRI. However, the cost and complexity of MRI as well as concerns about
safety and tolerability have been barriers to screening women with MDB, and there remains no consensus on
whether or how supplemental screening should be performed in women with MDB, which underscores the need for
a functional modality with a more favorable cost, tolerability, and safety profile.
Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) is a functional screening tool that utilizes gamma detectors to image the
preferential uptake of a radiotracer in breast cancers. Like MRI, MBI detects invasive breast cancers that are not
visible on mammography due to breast density and preferentially detects aggressive cancers, but is less costly and
complex to interpret compared to MRI. MBI has shown promise when evaluated in single-center studies, but has
yet to be evaluated across diverse breast imaging practices and patient populations, and has yet to be compared to
3D mammography (also known as digital breast tomosynthesis [DBT]), which is becoming the new standard
screening mammography test. This need for multicenter validation, coupled with additional concerns about cost and
radiation dose have limited MBI adoption to date.
We propose the Density MATTERS (Molecular Breast Imaging and Tomosynthesis to Eliminate the Reservoir of
Undetected Cancers) clinical trial in which 3000 women will undergo concurrent MBI and DBT at study entry and
one year later. We hypothesize that MBI, whether in combination with DBT or alone, will detect at least twice as
many invasive cancers as DBT and will lead to fewer advanced cancers in the second year of screening, which are
associated with higher breast cancer mortality. We will also compare the costs of these two screening approaches
and validate a new image processing tool so MBI can be acquired at a radiation effective dose as low as DBT.
This project is timely as a February 2019 federal law now mandates that women with MDB are informed of the risk
of tumor masking on mammography. Thus, up to half of women nationwide will be seeking a solution for improved
screening. Project outcomes could change clinical practice for women with MDB by validating MBI as an
immediately available, safe and well-tolerated screening solution to detect invasive cancers missed on
mammography and DBT, without increasing costs or radiation exposure."
10853968,"Infectious diseases remain an important global threat despite the continuing invention of drugs, vaccines, and
other effective interventions. Two principal factors drive this continued threat: 1) efficacious interventions are
nearly always met with rapid evolutionary responses on the part of pathogens and disease-transmitting
vectors, reducing their potency over time, and 2) the threat of infectious diseases is dynamic and exacerbated
by the growing and increasingly connected human population, as evidenced by disruptive outbreaks,
epidemics and pandemics in recent years driven by Zika, Ebola, Candida auris, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria
and, of course, SARS-CoV-2.
 Genomics, transcriptomics, and associated scientific tools for investigating pathogens in precise detail
and at tremendous scale offer new means to combat existing and emerging infectious diseases. Our GCID
combines deeply experienced Management, Administrative, and Technology and Data teams, with scientists
who have exceptional records in microbial genomics, to apply innovative approaches to crucial problems in
infectious disease research. Our four Research Projects, devoted to viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic
diseases, and vectors responsible for their transmission, will target high priority pathogens and
pathogen-host-vector systems with a major impact on the global burden of disease. To maximize synergy
between Projects, our research aims were developed with a common conceptual framework and shared
approaches, and leverage working relationships that have been developed through years of close collaboration
and scientific dialogue within our center and with the wider community of infectious disease research and
public health officials. Using those shared concepts and approaches, supported by our Cores, our GCID will
pursue three broad, long-range objectives across our four Projects:
Specific Aim 1: Identify and profile novel threats and therapeutic targets. We hypothesize that selectively
applying genomic methods to gather and prioritize information will accelerate counter measures against the
emergence of resistance to existing therapeutics and effective responses to new disease emergencies and
spillover events.
Specific Aim 2: Inform clinical treatments for the benefit of patients and populations. We hypothesize
that genomic and transcriptomic data will improve disease treatment by more rapidly and precisely defining the
basis of resistance and virulence.
Specific Aim 3: Drive precision public health surveillance and responses to disease emergence. We
hypothesize that genomic analyses will improve our responses to infectious threats to support public health.
Impact: We will develop innovative genomic approaches and datasets to address critical gaps in knowledge
and capacity across diverse infectious diseases, and disseminate data and tools to the wider community."

With the increase of agriculture practices to satisfy global food demand, there has been an increase in pollution
of nitrogenous compounds from agricultural run-off in water drinking sources. The acute ingestion of nitrite, a
byproduct of this nitrogenous waste, can lead to several physiological disorders (i.e., methemoglobinemia,
cardiac disorders, endocrine disruption, and neural damage). However, very little is known about continuous
exposure to nitrites at the low concentrations found in our drinking water. Moreover, the effects of these chronic
exposure to nitrite during pregnancy and embryo development are unknown. We hypothesize that pregnancy is
a stage with high sensitivity to pollutants effects, in which nitrites can interfere with the transfer of steroids,
immune factors, and transcripts to the embryo. Thus, dampening the proper neurological development and
growth of the embryo. The overall goal of this research project is to assess the effect of chronic consumption of
nitrate during the full gestational period. For that, we will use a live-bearing fish model, Xiphophorus couchianus,
that allows having a high number of spawns per female (around 20 fully developed juveniles) in a short period
(1 month). We will test our hypothesis in the following (2) specific research aims: Aim 1. To measure the effect
of environmental nitrite in steroid and immune factor transfer from mother to embryo. Aim 2. To determine the
effect of nitrite-induced loss of maternal factor transfer in embryo development and olfactory function. Under the
first aim, we will (i) measure the transfer of steroids and immune factors into embryos from mothers exposed to
several concentrations of nitrite and (ii) analyze the changes in maternal transcript transfer after nitrite treatment
using taqSec transcriptomic analysis. Finally, in (iii) we will localize and measure the expression of these
transcripts by spatial imaging techniques in slices from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded block of ovaries and
embryos. In aim 2, we will characterize the neurological damage in juveniles from mothers exposed to nitrite by
assessing olfactory function and cognitive behavior. The expected outcome of this work is to establish a
pregnancy model that can be used to test toxicological processes derived from pollutant ingestion. Moreover,
this work can inform about safe levels of environmental nitrate ingestion during pregnancy and designing
preventive treatments to address the concerning increasing nitrate in drinking water."
10850399,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Age related hearing Loss (ARHL) is one of the most common chronic conditions affecting nearly one third of
the world's population over 60 years. Hearing aids (HAs) are the most commonly used and effective treatment
for people with ARHL. However, hearing aid uptake is low with only one in 4 people with hearing loss using HA
in high-income countries. This low uptake has been attributed to several multilevel factors including
awareness, high cost of the device, stigma, and perceived need. To address accessibility and affordability
issues with HAs, the U.S. Congress passed a new Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid (OTC HA) act in 2017. In
August 2022, the FDA finalized this legislation creating a new OTC HA category, which allows consumers to
purchase a HA without consulting a hearing care professional (HCP), significantly reducing the cost of these
devices. Unlike a traditional gold standard HA acquisition model where users need an in-person consultation
with HCPs to obtain prescription hearing aids, OTC HA do not have any requirements for consultation with
HCPs. In anticipation of OTC HA, several new service delivery models for HA provision have become evident
in the US. These include: OTC HA fit by a HCP using audiology best practices (OTC-HCP), OTC HA fit to
individual users using some best practices via remote consultation (OTC-R), and users purchasing self-fit OTC
HAs without any clinical support from HCPs (OTC-SF). These new service delivery models, if proven effective,
are likely to improve accessibility and affordability of HAs. However, concerns remain about their safety and
unproven efficacy given that these models are newly emerging.
The overall aim of the proposed project is to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of emerging OTC service
delivery models (OTC-HCP, OTC-R, OTC-SF) with the gold standard traditional HA-HCP model. We propose a
prospective four-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with longitudinal repeated measures. This trial
will be a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study in which we will simultaneously examine the
implementability of the different service delivery models. Aim 1 will focus on comparing the effectiveness of HA
intervention delivered via four service delivery models (i.e., HA-HCP, OTC-HCP, OTC-R, and OTC-SF) using
self-reported, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes in an RCT. In the same study, Aim 2 involves comparing the
neurophysiologic outcomes between the HA service delivery models. Finally, Aim 3 focuses on optimizing
implementability of OTC HA service delivery from multiple multilevel perspectives. The proposed research is
conducted by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in audiology, cognition, neuroplasticity, health information
technology, implementation science, digital hearing, qualitative and mixed methods approach, and healthcare
economic. Results of our study will provide an urgently needed detailed examination of the effectiveness of
emerging service delivery models for OTC HAs compared to the traditional gold standard HCP model for adults
with mild-moderate ARHL informing clinical practice and policy recommendations."
10853102,"ABSTRACT
Age-associated cognitive decline varies in extent among individuals, and this variation likely arises from a
complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. The Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for
Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) is based on the most compelling evidence in the diet-dementia field.
Epidemiological data suggest that greater adherence to the MIND diet slows the rate of cognitive decline and
reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Genome-wide association studies of AD are enriched with
variants mapping to genes implicated in immune response and cholesterol metabolism, which may result in
different responses to preventive measures such as diet. Foods and nutrients emphasized by MIND have also
been shown to have beneficial effects on the brain, potentially mediated by immunity or cholesterol pathways.
Genetic factors contributing to between-person variation in metabolism of key MIND components may also
enhance or limit their efficacy and ultimately impact response to this diet.
MIND associations with cognitive health are modest overall but, when combined with individual genetic
information concerning AD susceptibility and MIND-component metabolism, may reveal subgroups of the
population who especially benefit when adhering to this diet. Our proposal leverages the first, ongoing MIND
trial as well as existing community- and population-based data to examine how genetic differences in (a) AD
predisposition and (b) nutrient metabolism modify the response to the MIND diet. Our research will provide
mechanistic insights into the role that MIND may play in slowing cognitive decline and will also inform the
implementation of MIND for optimal effectiveness."

Recent trends highlight the importance of championing a genomics research workforce that is inclusive and
reflective of individuals who are commonly underrepresented in the genomics enterprise. Offering training to the
entry-level workforce such as Community Health Workers (CHWs) can support workforce diversity and genomics
research broadly by ensuring the entry-level workforce fully understands the genomics aspects of the research
in which they are engaged. CHWs are a highly diverse workforce. The workforce has witnessed unprecedented
growth, with $225 million in support from the Biden-Harris administration to train 14,000 CHWs in 2022 and an
anticipated 15% increase in the number of CHWs in the US by 2029. Although CHWs are from the communities
they serve, regularly interact with diverse populations, and have expressed interest in receiving training in
genomics and related competencies, CHWs have yet to be provided with appropriate training in genomics. Thus,
CHWs are an obvious but not well-equipped potential entry-level genomics research workforce. To address the
unmet need of developing a trained network of CHWs with genomics competencies, we propose the PaRtnEring
to build understanding oF gEnomics Responsibly (PREFER) CHW Genomics Research Education Program
(PREFER CHW). Through this program we will work closely with five partner sites in the Southeast United States
(The Center for Community Health Alignment, North Carolina CHW Association, South Carolina State University,
Southern Mississippi University, and the Tennessee CHW Association). The CHW workforce is highly active in
the Southeast, with over 10,000 CHWs engaged in the region and over 3,000 CHWs in the four states (South
Carolina, North Carolina, Mississippi, and Tennessee) that are participating in PREFER CHW. The Southeast
United States is home to higher proportions of individuals that are underrepresented in the genomics research
workforce (i.e., from racial minority groups, disadvantaged, rural, poor, and lower educational attainment
backgrounds), making CHWs a critical entry-level genomics research workforce. Specifically, we will: 1) refine
and finalize an educational curriculum (PREFER CHW) focused on 10 key genomic competencies, 2) implement
the program among 150 CHWs using online asynchronous and synchronous methods, 3) equip partner sites to
continue delivering PREFER CHW, and 4) assess the content and program goals of PREFER CHW. Our
approach builds from the substantial strengths of the lead site faculty (Medical University of South Carolina) in
genomics education and history of collaboration with partner sites. PREFER CHW offers a viable, sustainable
solution of training CHWs in genomics competencies to help enhance the capacity of the entry-level genomics
research workforce and leverages the existing network of CHWs to improve genomics research workforce
diversity."

Given the prevalence of crosstalk among oncogenic pathways and disease
heterogeneity, it has become increasingly apparent that combination therapies are
required to achieve long-term cure and to minimize development of resistance mutations
and escape pathways. The majority of existing combination therapies are developed in
an ad hoc fashion, namely one agent at a time, without systematic consideration of
potential complex interactions among the gene targets by leveraging disease-specific
omics data. Moreover, the existing combination therapies are based on targets of
existing drugs, which only represent a small portion of the human proteome. To this end,
we hypothesize that systematic identification of synergistic key regulators represents a
promising approach for nominating targets of combination therapy. Towards this goal,
we will forward engineer a platform for identifying synergistic regulatory nodes in a
cancer gene regulatory network as the targets for combination therapy. We will generate
disease-specific multi-omics data to construct an integrative gene regulatory network, a
pre-requisite for understanding the deregulated gene network in the cancer cells and for
developing effective and lasting therapy. We will focus our study on Philadelphia-like
acute lymphoblastic leukemia as a proof-of-principle. Our team proposes a novel
approach to this problem by leveraging the unique strengths of the investigators in
systems biology, genomics, proteomics, and translational research, as well as the large
cohort of patient samples available at our institutions. If successful, the proposed
framework would be a tremendous advance and paradigm shift to understand genetic
interactions among oncogenic pathways for eventual therapeutic intervention."
10850238,"Project Summary/Abstract: Whole brain synaptic density imaging with quantitative positron emission
tomography (PET) has demonstrated critical insights into understanding of neurodegenerative disorders and
epilepsy, especially in the setting of normal anatomical MRI. We propose to use quantitative whole brain PET
with a novel synaptic density tracer to characterize the synaptic density changes in the setting of targeted
radiation therapy in rodents and to correlate it to cognitive changes that occur after radiation therapy. While
radiation therapy is a life-saving standard of care for treatment of central nervous system (CNS) malignancies
in both adults and children, cognitive decline is one of the major complications and has been tied to
multifactorial mechanism which includes loss of synapses, white matter damage, endothelial cell damage, and
activation of neuroinflammatory markers within the hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex. Hippocampal sparing
radiation therapy is the leading approach to preserve cognitive function in patients requiring radiation therapy.
Unfortunately, even after hippocampal sparing radiation, over 50% of patients develop debilitating cognitive
decline. With increase in long term survival of patients with CNS malignancies, there is a critical need to
understand the mechanisms behind radiation induced brain injury, so that therapies can be targeted to prevent
post-radiation cognitive decline. Currently there are no established drugs that prevent or treat the sequelae of
radiation, nor are there biomarkers to monitor cellular damage. Availability of these could be used to modify
treatment protocols prior to the development of severe cognitive decline. Characterization of whole brain
dynamic changes in synapses and how they are related to white matter damage have not been evaluated up to
now, because tools to study whole brain synaptic density have not been readily available. To characterize the
mechanisms behind radiation induced cognitive decline, we will use a novel PET tracer that has been
established to measure synaptic density and quantitative PET modeling for quantification of synaptic density in
different regions of the human brain. We assembled a team of experts in fields of quantitative PET, rodent
quantitative MRI, rodent radiation therapy, rodent neuropathology, and cognitive assessment to determine the
time course of synaptic density changes in different regions of the brain and how it relates to pathological
assessment of synaptic density, white matter damage, and neuroinflammation. The short term goal of this
project is to characterize the hippocampal and extra-hippocampal synaptic density changes in rats after
targeted half-brain radiation. The long term goal is to use this model to characterize the molecular mechanisms
of radiation therapy induced CNS damage in human patients that must undergo radiation treatments for brain
tumors. Completion of this project will characterize a novel non-invasive biomarker of radiation induced
cognitive decline that can be translated into clinical trials and used for monitoring of synaptic density changes
to personalize treatment."
10850239,"Project Summary
Collagen has been used for biomedical applications for many decades due to its unsurpassed biocompatibility
and chemically tunable mechanical properties. There is a growing need for processible collagen due to rapidly
developing tissue and organ engineering. The major source of raw collagen is animal tissue; thus, safety and
possible contamination are major concerns. Current attempts to make synthetic collagen-like materials start from
collagen-like peptides synthesized by classical solid-phase peptide synthesis, and thus, is not suitable for large-
scale preparation and has little potential for clinical translation. We propose to develop a new approach to
address an unmet need in synthesis of peptide polymers: controlling the polymer sequence and at the same
time generating high molecular weight polymers. More specifically, we aim to develop collagen-like polymers by
de novo synthesis starting from tripeptide ProHypGly-N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) and by ring opening lead to
polymerization via kinetically controlled polycondensation. The ring opening polymerization of NCA is a very well-
established method of synthetizing peptide polymers from single amino acids. The polymer synthesis can be
controlled to yield high molecular weight homopolymers, block-copolymers, and branched and functional
polymers. However, the problem of controlling the sequence of amino acids within the polymer has not been
resolved. We outline two synthetic routes to synthesize the monomer N-Boc-ProHyp(OtBu)Gly-NCA for the
synthesis of collagen-like polymers. Moreover, we propose the simultaneous deprotection of Boc group in
tripeptide NCA revealing an open N-terminus, as well as the initiation of kinetically controlled polycondensation
leading to collagen-like polymer. While the monodisperse polymers are viewed as better suited for clinical
translation, we postulate that having a polydisperse collagen-like polymer will enable self-assembly into the triple
helix conformation that is required for mechanical stability of collagen-like matrix. The helical structure of the
collagen-like polymers will be observed with Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy. The biocompatibility of the
collagen polymer will be evaluated with Human Dermal Fibroblast cell culture and mechanical characterization
will be performed at UC San Diego Materials Research Science and Engineering Center. The proposed synthesis
and characterization methods have been evaluated for safety and accessibility, because all experiments and
data analysis will be performed by undergraduate and MS graduate students. We envision that the development
of this novel approach will open the door to synthesis of many types of polymer peptides with short repeatable
peptide sequences (e.g., elastin-like and RGD peptides)."
10854839,"Rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) homicides are three-fold higher among Black women and IPV-related
deaths rob Black women of at least a decade of life relative to White women. Lifetime IPV prevalence is also
higher among Black (50%) than White (35%) women. This persistent and disproportionate impact of IPV for
Black women strongly suggests the need for an intersectionality framework to inform IPV intervention and
prevention services for Black women delivered by health care providers. The American College of Obstetrics &
Gynecology (ACOG) recommends routine IPV screening and supports implementation of `trauma-informed
care with close attention to avoiding stigmatization and prioritizing resilience'. As a Tennessee-based HBCU,
Meharry Medical College is ideally positioned to heed ACOG's call to action. We propose the use of an
intersectionality framework to inform the adaptation, implementation and evaluation of clinic-based trauma and
violence informed care (TVIC) intervention. Meharry is home to an evidence-based trauma-informed care
intervention for HIV care; this intervention will inform our IPV focused intervention's development. To support
women's health equity and actualize ACOG recommendations, we propose the adaptation, implementation,
and rigorous evaluation of an innovative TVIC intervention. By using an intersectionality framework in the
adaptation of our TVIC intervention, we seek to ensure its relevance for Black women. Our primary goal is
the adaptation, implementation and evaluation of a TVIC intervention designed for Black women in
Central Tennessee. In this 5-year RCMI project, we propose 3 aims. Aim 1) Engage a stakeholder committee
of patients, providers, and experts (COPE) to adapt a trauma & violence informed care (TVIC) intervention for
Black women and their healthcare providers at Meharry. [Years 1-2]. Aim 2) Implement and prospectively
evaluate the adapted TVIC intervention at the healthcare provider-level, measuring changes in Meharry
healthcare provider's self-efficacy for TVIC implementation and alignment with TIC knowledge, attitudes, and
practices. [Years 2-3] Aim 3) Implement the adapted TVIC intervention at the patient-level to provide trauma-
informed IPV screening, brief interventions, and referrals to treatment (SBIRT), and rigorously evaluate this
TVIC intervention's impact on the primary outcome of patient-perceived usefulness of intervention and reported
linkage to IPV services, and the secondary outcome of changes at the clinic-level relative to climate and
culture, through a non-randomized pragmatic trial design. [Year 4-5]. Meharry's mission of `advancing health
equity through innovative research' and `compassionate health services' make this HBCU an ideal setting for
this innovative and impactful research. This research has the potential to transform the care Black women who
experience IPV receive with the goal of addressing the disproportionate impact IPV has for Black women. Early
detection of IPV via universal screening coupled with IPV-related trauma-informed care can reduce the range
of IPV-associated mental and physical health consequences and medical costs, estimated at $2.1 trillion USD."

The Overarching Goal for our project is to better understand the impact of environmental stressors (i.e., due to
demographic, socioeconomic, and/or psychosocial factors) on the incidence of gestational poor sleep quality
that we predict triggers adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO; i.e., gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, fetal growth
restriction, premature delivery, hemorrhage, and stillbirths) more prevalent in African American women than
Caucasian women. Our Central Hypothesis is that “High Levels of Psychosocial and Socioeconomic Stressors
Alter Gestational Sleep Quality, Reduce Coping Response, and Impair Glucose Tolerance Resulting in Adverse
Pregnancy Outcomes”. To test this, we will enroll 256 otherwise healthy pregnant (singleton) African American
women (ages 18-40 years) and followed starting from 12-14 weeks of gestation. Thus, under Aim 1 we will
qualitatively and quantitatively measure sleep quality coupled with evaluation of demographic, socioeconomic
status (SES), and psychosocial status )PSS). In Aim 2, we will assess how poor sleep quality affects
physiological functions for the regulation of maternal nutrients (glucose, amino acids, lipids). We will collect blood
and saliva samples and measure key hormones regulating metabolism (insulin, corticotropin-releasing hormone
(CRH), free and total cortisol), and carrier proteins (CRH-binding protein, cortisol-binding globulins). Finally, in
Aim 3, we will determine the association between poor sleep quality versus gestational diabetes, preeclampsia,
and stress levels during gestation. Several interrelated clinical biomarkers will be quantified to verify the physical
and health status of participants (i.e., hemoglobin A1c, cortisol, C-reactive protein, lipid panel, and
comprehensive metabolic panel), respectively. Altogether, we expect to find that high levels of SES and PSS
predispose African American women to gestational poor sleep quality and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Impact and Innovation: This study will yield new knowledge on the impact of low socioeconomic status and
psychosocial stress on gestational sleep quality and APO in African American women. This may partly account
for the disparities in APO since African Americans typically deal with a heavy burden of psychosocial and
socioeconomic stress in the American society. Overall, the concept that gestational poor sleep quality is a potent
risk factor able to ‘unbalance’ the intricate catabolic state that occurs in the second half of pregnancy is novel. If
validated this will uniquely inform screening tests for early detection of poor sleep quality during gestation and
implementation of evidence-based non-drug strategies for the curtailment of disparities in APO."

 Approximately 1.2 million people in the US and ~ 37 million people worldwide are living with HIV-1. In
spite of considerable progress in HIV/AIDS research, anti-retroviral therapy (ART) remains the only treatment
option for HIV-1 infection. While ART has been highly effective in controlling the virus and making HIV infection
a manageable disease, the drugs used in the ART regimens cause adverse side effects. Among the most widely
prescribed antiretrovirals (ARVs) are integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) which block the critical step of
HIV-1 integration into host chromosomes. Unfortunately, recent reports suggest association of INSTI prescription
with treatment-limiting neuropsychiatric adverse effects. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that drive
neuropsychiatric effects of INSTIs are critically important for the long-term success of ART. The goal of this
proposal is to identify the mechanisms of INSTI-associated neuropsychiatric adverse events (NPAEs).
 Currently, it is recommended that INSTIs be included in all initial regimens for HIV-1 treatment. the most
preferred ARVs. Currently approved INSTIs include raltegravir, elvitegravir, dolutegravir, bictegravir, and
cabotegravir. Although generally reported to be safe and effective there is a growing concern about the adverse
metabolic and neuropsychiatric effects associated with the INSTIs. We hypothesize that that INSTI-associated
NPAEs are driven by alterations in glutamate and calcium signaling that affect synaptic function and
neuronal communication in specific brain circuits. To test this, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we
will e
lucidate the effects of HIV-1 INSTIs on glutamate neurotransmission. In
Aim 2, we will decipher
the
mechanism of INSTI-induced glutamate neurotransmission. In
Aim 3, we will probe the adverse effects of HIV-
1 INSTIs on neuropsychiatric circuitry. To achieve the goals of these specific aims, we have developed a novel
approach that combines the expertise in HIV neuropathogenesis, to that of neuroscience and neuropsychiatric
disorders and clinical research. Through this multidisciplinary approach, our studies will uncover novel cellular
and biochemical pathways that may be targeted to reduce INSTI-associated neuropsychiatric adverse effects.
 HIV/AIDS disproportionally affects African-Americans and other minorities. ART is the only treatment
option available to reduce the disproportionate burden of this deadly disease. Unfortunately, long-term exposure
to ART contributes to treatment-limiting NPAEs among HIV-1 positive individuals. Given the rapidly expanding
global use of INSTIs to treat HIV, it is critical to understand the mechanisms that drive these NPAEs to reduce
the disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS. Therefore, our proposed studies focused on HIV/AIDS are
perfectly aligned with the overall goals of the RCMI program."
10854844,"COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE: PROGRAM SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Racial and ethnic health disparities persist, despite numerous mitigation efforts. It is indisputable that
community engagement in research is essential for developing and translating research to address these
disparities. An infrastructure to support community/academic research partnership development,
implementation, and translation of research findings into real-world settings is essential.
The Meharry Community Engagement Core (MCEC), established in the current grant cycle, is the first
organized unit at Meharry that exclusively supports community engaged research. Led by Meharry researchers
with extensive community engaged research experience, working in partnership with community stakeholders,
the MCEC “connects community members and organizations with Meharry researchers to conduct research
and share results that will improve health for communities that experience the poorest health outcomes.”
The goal of the MCEC is to support high impact, community engaged research and facilitate timely
dissemination and translation of results into sustainable real-world settings. In the next cycle, the following
aims will be implemented in support of this goal:
Specific Aim 1. Support existing and facilitate new long-term relationships with CBOs and other
community stakeholders. Select activities: Build/maintain a coalition of stakeholders using existing (e.g.,
pairing them to research roles/topics of interest) and new (e.g., broadly sharing lay dissemination products
from CBO/academic partnerships) strategies and foster collaboration between community stakeholders and
Research/Pilot project investigators by facilitating co-development of community-prioritized research questions.
Specific Aim 2. Enhance existing and implement new strategies to increase community participation in
research and recruitment and retention of study participants. Select activities: Increase opportunities for
community input and participation in research by expanding number and type of researchers that leverage CE
Studios8. Increase the number of participants in the Meharry Research Partners Database, a Meharry-only
research participant registry, by implementing Meharry student-developed social marketing campaigns.
Specific Aim 3. Enhance and expand research dissemination and translation efforts among diverse
stakeholder groups and audiences. Select activities: Increase lay dissemination of results from
CBO/academic partnerships by including it as an expected deliverable during partnership development.
Support planning processes to translate research findings into community/system-level changes by facilitating
modified versions of translation studios in which the focus will be on identifying next steps, feasibility of next
steps/alternatives, resources, and sustainability."
10854846,"The Investigator Development Core (IDC) will address the development of early-career
investigators in basic biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research through a pilot project
program that allows researchers to generate preliminary data for submission of grant
applications, particularly focusing on research related to diseases that disproportionally
impact minority or other disparity populations, or those that address health disparities.
Professional development opportunities to increase junior faculty and post-doctoral
fellows' participation, advancement, and leadership capabilities will be linked to this core.
The overarching goal of the IDC is to produce the next generation of successful junior
investigators studying basic biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research focused on
health disparities. Thus, the IDC will enable our junior researchers to successfully apply
for extramural funding and progress in their academic careers as funded investigators.
The IDC will apply innovative strategies to provide robust research career development
resources, leverage technology and data science to address health disparities, mentor
junior faculty and post-doctoral fellows, and create a holistic, individualized, and rigorous
track for each IDC participant. To achieve these goals, the IDC will pursue three specific
aims:
1) Establish a pilot awards program targeted to post-doctoral fellows and junior
 faculty to advance basic, behavioral, and clinical research in health disparities.
2) Mentor the pilot project investigators to enhance their career development,
 publications, and research outcomes derived from pilot research funds.
3) Implement a grant submission timeline for extramural grant funding appropriate to
 the pilot investigator's career stage.
The IDC is envisioned as a magnet and an engine - a magnet that attracts early-stage
investigators into health disparities research and an engine that nurtures them toward
success in NIH grant funding. Findings from the proposed pilot project health disparities
research program will lead to new K, R, and equivalent extramural grants, the outcomes
of which will contribute to healthier communities across the nation."
10854848,"Project Summary. The overarching goal of Meharry RCMI Research Capacity Core (MRRCC) is to increase
the number of funded investigators at Meharry Medical College. To this end, RCMI has equipped and staffed
MRRCC with the latest state of the art biomedical instrumentation that enables our investigators to compete on
equal footing with investigators from research intensive institutions like Vanderbilt University. MRRCC Core
directors have also established a close working relationship with their counterparts at Vanderbilt University such
that our investigators are able to access equipment at Vanderbilt that they may need but not currently available
at Meharry. For example, our investigators can access and utilize electron microscope at Vanderbilt for their
imaging needs due to such arrangements (see letter of support). During the current funding cycle of RCMI, our
investigators were able to obtain R01, R21, SC1 and U54-Cancer investigator-initiated funding based on the
data generated in MRRCC. These non-RCMI grants that were obtained with the help of MRRCC totaled more
than $ 11,000,000. MRRCC has also fostered collaboration among our investigators. For example, during the
current RCMI funding cycle, 314 basic science grant applications collaborated with at least one of the 5 MRRCC
cores. Specifically, 65 applications collaborated with one core, 50 with 2 cores, 54 with 3 cores, 37 with 4 cores
and 8 collaborated with all the 5 cores. We have 2 broad specific aims for MRRCC in the current application:
Aim 1. Expand core services and resources. We will purchase with institutional funds an OpenSPR system for
protein-protein interactions in real time and Seahorse for metabolomics studies. As funds become available, we
will continue to provide new instrumentation based on our user’s needs. We will establish a new Genomics Data
Core. This core will provide Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis, data mining, AI/ML, and
visualization through development of genomic databases and state-of-the-art data-access portal. Lastly we will
establish Gene Editing Services. The new core service will help users with the design of CRISPR/Cas9
experimental protocols, perform transfection/infection, determine CRISPR efficiency, clone positive cells, and
evaluate on/off-targets efficiency.
Aim 2. Continue to provide high quality service. The services we provide are deemed necessary for generating
preliminary data for grants, publishing manuscripts in high impact journals, and enabling acquisition of extramural
grant support. We will enhance business operations. We are establishing direct connectivity with our Office of
Information Technology (OIT) to provide seamless data tracking and improve cost recovery by connecting within
institutional-level systems. We will also enhance interconnectivity within the MRRCC Sub-Cores, Meharry
research departments, and the national RCMI network. We will enhance cost recovery efforts by requiring
funded investigators to budget at least $ 2,000 per year for services that they will get from MRRCC."
10854772,"Title: Personalized Cancer Therapy Guided by Photoacoustic Chemical Imaging (PACI)
of Tumor Microenvironment (TME)
Abstract:
Tumors are often found in an altered metabolic state, which leads to anomalous chemical composition, such as
hypoxia (low oxygen level), acidosis (low pH level), and hyperkalemia (high potassium concentration). These
three form a “therapy resistance triad (O2, pH, and K+)”, suppressing cancer’s responses to radio-, chemo-,
and immuno-therapy. As each triad member’s concentration is strongly relevant to cancer progress and
response to therapy, a non-invasive, sensitive, and reliable approach for evaluating their temporal and spatial
distributions in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in vivo, non-invasively, is highly desirable. To fill this serious
and long-standing gap in technology, we introduce a novel set of O2, pH, and K+ sensing nanoprobes that, in
combination with the emerging photoacoustic imaging technology, enables quantitative mapping of the O2, pH,
and K+ levels in solid tumors in vivo. The central hypothesis of this proposed research is that, enabled by our
photoacoustic chemical imaging (PACI) powered with sensitive chemical indicator nanoprobes, we can image
and quantitatively evaluate the spatio-temporal distributions of the TME’s therapy resistance triad (O2, pH, and
K+), at depths of up to a few centimeters, in vivo and in a non-invasive fashion, and then correlate with cancer
responses to treatments via radio-, chemo-, and immuno-therapy. This hypothesis will be examined rigorously
using orthotopic patient derived xenograft (PDX) breast cancer mouse models. To enable a comprehensive
understanding of the technology’s capabilities, as well as limitations, the imaging results from PACI of the TME
will be compared for a wide variety of PDX tumor models and treatment situations. To examine the central
hypothesis, our research will focus on three specific aims: Aim 1. Understand tumor response to radio-therapy
by PACI of the TME; Aim 2. Understand tumor response to chemo-therapy by PACI of the TME; and Aim 3.
Understand tumor response to immuno-therapy by PACI of the TME.
Potential impact: As the orthotopic PDX tumors faithfully resemble the original tumors in cancer patients,
including their TME, chemical imaging of these PDX tumors, combined with studying the correlations of the
imaging findings with the cancer responses to therapies, could have a large impact on translational research
and clinical management of breast cancer, e.g. helping to discriminate the most suitable treatment plan or
alternative plan for individual cancer patients. By the end of this funding period, we will objectively test and
thoroughly verify whether the novel PACI technology powered by sensitive nanoprobes can image the TME’s
chemical properties of PDX mouse tumors in vivo, non-invasively, for predicting the cancer responses to radio-
, chemo-, and immuno-therapy. Once successfully validated, the proposed strategy could shed new light on
imaging-guided personalized cancer medicine, so as to hopefully ensure an optimal treatment outcome."
10854773,"Yale School of Medicine has a long tradition and record of accomplishments in training medical students for
careers in academic medicine and research. This application is a competitive renewal of a training grant (Short-
Term Training: Students in Health Professional Schools) that was first awarded in 1987-88 and is now in its 34th
consecutive year. The purpose of the renewal is to provide intensive short-term training in research for selected
predoctoral medical students in 93 of the most outstanding laboratories and training sites at the Yale School of
Medicine. The specific training will range from fundamental molecular biology and cellular physiology to applied
clinical research in areas related to heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) conditions. The program is designed to
attract the most highly qualified Yale medical students into careers as physician-scientists in the biomedical
sciences and HLBS domains. A recently conducted extensive follow-up documents a record of superb
subsequent research training, research productivity, and faculty appointments (40.7%) among previously
supported students.
Trainees will be pre-doctoral medical students who have completed in good standing at least one year of the
curriculum at the Yale School of Medicine. Twenty-four students per year will be selected competitively for this

The proposed research will focus on understanding the role of resilience in addressing mental health
disparities for transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals. Clinical and scientific understandings of TGD
health have been conceptualized primarily through the minority stress model (Brooks, 1981; Meyer, 1995;
2003; Testa et al., 2015) which disproportionately focuses on deficit and risk. In contrast, resilience moves
beyond risk identification and has the potential to inform the development of interventions to help protect TGD
people from minority stressors and heal from the consequent harm (Meyer, 2015). Matsuno & Israel (2018)
recently proposed the Transgender Resilience Intervention Model (TRIM) as an expanded version of the
minority stress model (Meyer, 2003; Testa et al., 2015). TRIM presents a promising theoretical framework from
which to understand the role of resilience in mitigating the impact of minority stressors on mental health for
TGD individuals. However, current measures do not provide a comprehensive way to assess TGD resilience
as outlined in the TRIM. Our preliminary work significantly broadens the conceptualization of resilience and
provides an important starting point from which to develop items for our proposed Multidimensional TGD-
Resilience Scale. We incorporate findings from our review (Puckett et al., 2022) with recent research and
preliminary data from each of the MPIs in order to map onto NIMHD’s health disparities research framework.
We will use this framework as a conceptual map for developing initial items for our Multidimensional TGD-
Resilience Scale that reflect individual, interpersonal, community, and societal levels of influence. In order to
broaden the utility of our measure to address the unique needs of TGD POC, we propose a fifth level of
influence related to intersectional resilience. In this 4-year MPI project, Drs. Puckett, Matsuno, and Galupo will
work with expert and community panelists to develop and evaluate initial scale items for our Multidimensional
TGD-Resilience Scale (Aim 1), psychometrically investigate our novel measure (Aim 2), and investigate the
protective function of resilience in relation to TGD health disparities using a longitudinal design (Aim 3). This
project is poised to broaden our conceptualization and measurement practices for TGD Resilience, reframe the
overall approach to TGD health to incorporate a strengths-based focus, and inform the development of
targeted mental health interventions to bolster resilience. This application is in response to PAR-22-072, which
calls for research on measures and methods to advance research on minority health and health disparities-
related constructs. The factors influencing TGD health disparities are under-researched and there are no
measures that reflect multidimensional manifestations of resilience or the unique characteristics of resilience
for TGD people. Our focus on protective factors directly aligns with NIMHD’s areas of interest and our
community-participatory approach provides an avenue for future research to better reflect TGD people’s lives."

 The objective of this multi-PI R01 application is to determine how the autophagy machinery regulates the
development of cocaine abuse. Cocaine is one of the most widely abused drugs, and produces a variety of
behaviors including reward, craving, and relapse. Although many pharmacological targets and behavioral
interventions have been explored, there are no FDA-approved medications for reducing cocaine use or treating
relapse in cocaine addicts. Autophagy is a key lysosomal degradation pathway that targets cargos for
degradation either selectively or non-selectively, and is temporally and spatially controlled by more than 30
autophagy genes. Autophagy occurs constitutively at a basal level, and can be further induced by stress. We
recently discovered that an autophagy-related protein Becn2/Beclin 2, which forms a complex with the
autophagy-inducing class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Vps34, is a novel regulator of acquisition of cocaine
reward behaviors via dopamine (DA) D2 receptors (D2Rs). Knockout of Becn2 (but not its homolog Becn1)
globally or specifically in DA neurons protects mice from cocaine-induced locomotor stimulation, conditioned
place preference, and intravenous self-administration. UPLC/mass spectrometry profiling indicates that cocaine-
induced accumulation of DA, but not other neurotransmitters, is attenuated by Becn2 depletion. In addition,
pharmacologically inhibiting autophagy kinases upstream of Becn2, including ULK1 and Vps34, mimics the
effects of Becn2 depletion/mutation on cocaine-induced reward behaviors and DA accumulation, suggesting the
existence of a ULK1-Vps34-Becn2 axis in the regulation of cocaine responses. Furthermore, biochemical
analyses reveal that D2R is a degradation target of Becn2 via binding to a Becn2-associated protein GASP1.
Genetic inhibition of Becn2 or pharmacological inhibition of ULK1 similarly increases striatal presynaptic D2Rs.
Based on these preliminary data, we propose to investigate the hypothesis that the ULK1-Vps34-Becn2
autophagy axis controls vulnerability to cocaine abuse by selectively regulating D2R autoreceptor endolysosomal
trafficking and degradation in DA neurons. Using a combination of genetic, imaging, biochemical, cellular and
behavioral approaches, we aim to answer the following questions: How does Becn2 function in DA neurons to
regulate acquisition of cocaine-taking, dose response, reinstatement of cocaine-seeking, and D2R catabolism
(Aim 1)? Is there a ULK1-Vps34-Becn2 autophagy pathway in DA neurons regulating these cocaine reward
behaviors, and if so, how does it work (Aim 2)? We anticipate that with these two fundamentally related aims,
our study will establish the function and mechanism of a Becn2-centered autophagy axis in the regulation of D2
receptor metabolism, DAergic function, and cocaine-related reward behaviors. A better understanding of this
novel molecular mechanism may provide new options for developing treatments for cocaine abuse and additional

Cardiorenal syndrome is an age-associated pathology where the dysfunction of the heart or kidney induces
excess extracellular matrix in the other organ. We propose, and our data supports, that age-associated
dysregulation between interorgan signaling promotes cardiorenal syndrome. Comorbidity, heterogeneity and
gender differences may be better managed by understanding how age affects kidney-adrenal-heart
communication and by what mechanisms these tissues induce fibrosis. This project will transplant adrenal and
kidney tissue between young and aged mice to determine how altered interorgan communication drives aging-
associated cardiac dysfunction. We will study the interaction of age-associated water-loss and interorgan
communication to determine how this impacts cardiorenal aging. Because we find that mammalian renal steroid
hormones can induce heart fibrosis in Drosophila by acting through a novel membrane receptor, we will
determine how this receptor signals to induce fibrosis and identify the corresponding receptor in mammalian
tissues. Overall, this proposal aims to understand how aging impacts interorgan communication to produce age-
associated cardiorenal syndrome and fibrosis, using models of Drosophila and mice."

The fungus Candida albicans is a ubiquitous pathobiont of the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT). It is also the
most common cause of life-threatening fungal infections in the United States and other developed countries.
These infections generally arise as a result of dissemination from the GIT; therefore, the biology of this species
in its native niche is relevant to the initiation of disease, yet it has been neglected in molecular, immunological,
and genomic studies. To understand this important biology, it is paramount to diversify the spectrum of C.
albicans strains that are studied by including isolates derived from the human GIT. To date, GIT isolates
represent a tiny minority of publicly available C. albicans strains and genome sequences. We hypothesize that
there is a wide diversity of C. albicans strains in the human GIT and that these strains engage in a broad spectrum
of interactions with the intestinal epithelium reflecting differences in their ability to attach to, and invade, the
intestinal mucosa and to eschew local host defenses. The research proposed herein will define the genomic
diversity of this fungal species in the human GIT, illuminate the range of responses that distinct C. albicans
isolates elicit in the intestinal epithelium, and identify Candida loci associated with fitness of the fungus in the
GIT. The project builds upon world-class sequencing, computational, and experimental capabilities at Baylor
College of Medicine and The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, leverages the largest
medical center in the world for human GIT-derived Candida isolates, and takes advantage of state-of-the-art
human organoid technology as well as mouse models of GIT colonization to probe the diversity of this medically
important fungus. Identifying fungal genetic markers associated with dissemination from the GIT will have
profound implications for the management of patients at particular risk for candidiasis."

Circadian clocks play a fundamental role in aligning physiological and behavioral processes to predictable
changes in the daily environment. For decades, circadian signaling has been implicated in the development of
cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in individuals with cardiovascular disease. However,
numerous critical knowledge gaps persist regarding the connection between circadian clocks, circadian
rhythms, and SCD. This research proposal addresses these knowledge gaps by investigating the molecular
mechanisms underlying the circadian regulation of ion channel transcripts and proteins that impact arrhythmia
susceptibility.
Aim 1 will elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the circadian regulation of cardiac ion channel
genes essential for cardiac excitability. Through comprehensive promoter analyses utilizing real-time
bioluminescence assays (LumiCycle), we will identify the conserved cis-regulatory element(s) essential for
circadian activity. The identified cis-regulatory element(s) will be validated using Chromatin
Immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays.
Aim 2 focuses on determining how circadian alignment and misalignment affect the transcription and
translation of genes essential for normal cardiac electrophysiology. We will explore the impact of time-restricted
feeding on the transcriptional and translational regulation of myocardial genes important for cardiac excitability
by employing mRNA-seq and Ribo-seq technology.
Aim 3 will determine the physiological implications of circadian alignment and misalignment on cardiac
electrophysiology, autonomic regulation, and arrhythmia susceptibility. We will assess the impact of
manipulating feeding-fasting cycles on cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia susceptibility utilizing an
arrhythmogenic mouse model with impaired cardiac conduction and ventricular refractoriness (Scn5a+/-). We
will also investigate how feeding-fasting cycles modulate the autonomic nervous system's regulation of cardiac
electrophysiology using an inducible cardiomyocyte-specific Rrad knockout mouse model (iCSΔRrad).
This interdisciplinary project lies at the interface between chronobiology and cardiac electrophysiology, and it
will generate new knowledge to provide valuable insight into how circadian clocks and alignment impact the
risk for cardiac arrhythmias. In addition, the results of this project are expected to identify novel
chronotherapeutic strategies that can readily be adopted to mitigate arrhythmogenic risk in vulnerable
populations."

Dynamics of interorgan communication and biological age change as a function of chronological age but these
dynamics and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Organ transplantation offers a clinically most
relevant model with donor/recipient age-discrepant combinations representing a clinical routine to meet the ever-
increasing organ demands. Our published studies and preliminary data show that an elevated donor age drives
the immunogenicity of organs leading to augmented alloimmune responses with higher acute rejection rates.
This, in turn, is blunted with the increase of recipient age, demonstrating both clinical relevance and inter-
organ/recipient communication. These clinically relevant scenarios raise the possibility of potential rejuvenation
and/or accelerated aging when performing heterochronic organ transplants. We have shown that the recipient
environment can affect the biological age of transplanted organs. Specifically, when transplanting old organs in
young recipients, we observed the reduction of donor organ biological age. At the same time, old organs
transplanted into young recipient mice promoted aging, which not only led to an accumulation of senescent cells
in peripheral organs, but also to a decline of physical and cognitive functions. Our project brings together a
synergistically positioned group of aging and transplantation researchers and clinicians. Vadim Gladyshev (MPI)
is an expert on aging biomarkers and the biology of aging. Stefan Tullius (MPI) is a clinician/scientist who provides
the clinical perspective. The latest generation of aging biomarkers based on omics approaches, combined with
state-of-the-art model systems place us in an unprecedented position to study inter-organ dynamics of aging.
Our hypothesis is that that young and old cells transferred with an organ transplant may exert rejuvenating and
aging effects extrinsically. This hypothesis will be tested in our established transplant models of clinical relevance
and confirmed using a unique clinical database. We also hypothesize that transplanted organs will acquire the
biological age approaching that of recipients. This includes the situation wherein old donor organs will be
rejuvenated in young recipients, potentially increasing the use of discarded organs. This approach is significant
and innovative in (i) delineating novel mechanisms of interorgan communication in a clinically relevant
heterochronic transplantation model with perturbation of specific tissues, (ii) the use of state-of-the-art tools of
aging science to characterize changes in biological age dynamics, (iii) the use of detailed mechanistic
approaches to pinpoint changes in interorgan communication upon biological age perturbation; (iv) synergistic
efforts of research groups combining deep complementary expertise in preclinical and clinical studies of aging
biology and transplant medicine; and (v) real-world implications of the proposed work. These studies position us
to substantially advance understanding of interorgan communication with regard to biological age, with the
potential to delineate novel pathways in support of organ rejuvenation and the prevention of transferring age-
accelerating effects with organ transplantation."

The microbiome plays an important role in many human disorders and diseases, including
cancer, autoimmune diseases and sexually transmitted infections. Microbial communities are
usually studied via their genetic sequences, and a major challenge in modern microbiome
science is that microbial sequencing introduces both bias and variability. The magnitude of
sample- and study- specific variation in sample measurements can exceed the magnitude of
variation due to treatment or disease status, which impedes the diagnosis and treatment of
complex diseases. To support low-cost, rigorous and reproducible microbiome research, we will
develop statistical tools to guide researchers in decision-making in the presence of
measurement error in microbiome studies. We will focus specifically on robust approaches to
differential abundance, integrated models for multiple biological units (including both within- and
across-kingdom interactions), and methods for emerging data structures (such as samples with
spike-in cells or communities). We will also develop recommendations on the experimental
design of microbiome studies, focusing on maximizing statistical power to make true discoveries
while minimizing sequencing and labor costs. Our methods apply to a broad range of microbial
questions, including ecology, metabolism, evolution, and community assembly. Our methods
will be accompanied by freely available, open-source software, as well as detailed tutorials and
forums for user questions. The long-term goal of this research is to improve the efficiency with
which microbiome science can have a positive impact on the etiology and treatment of human
disease and infection."
10840677,"Peptidoglycan (PG) is the mesh-like scaffolding that determines the shape and size of bacterial cells and protects
them from osmotic shock. In Gram-positive bacteria, thick PG provides the outer cellular layer to which wall-
teichoic acids, capsule, and extracellular proteins are covalently attached. The human respiratory pathogen
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) has emerged as a leading model for PG synthesis and its
regulation in ovoid-shaped Gram-positive bacteria. Pneumococcal PG synthesis shows fundamental differences
from PG synthesis in rod-shaped and spherical bacteria. Most notably, PG synthesis is zonal and carried out by
two separable PG synthase nanomachines confined to the midcell of dividing pneumococcal cells. The septal
PG synthase (bPBP2x:FtsW) locates to the leading edge of the closing septal annulus, while the elongasome
PG synthase (bPBP2b:RodA with RodZ, MreCD) locates to the outer rim of the septal annulus and pushes
peripheral PG outward. Both the septal and elongasome PG synthases move circumferentially at midcell driven
by PG synthesis, but not by FtsZ treadmilling. This project builds on previous findings to address the most
important current questions about PG synthesis in S. pneumoniae. One set of questions centers on the functions
and regulation of the three Class A PBP PG synthases (aPBP1a, aPBP1b, aPBP2a) in exponentially growing
and stressed pneumococcal cells, about which relatively little is known. By using a comprehensive approach that
includes innovative assays of septal and elongation PG synthesis rates in live cells, single-molecule (sm) motion
dynamics, and high-resolution microscopy, we will determine the contributions of the aPBPs to PG synthesis
and how their dynamics and localization are altered by mutational changes and cell-wall stress. Unbiased and
directed approaches will be used to identify aPBP interactors at different stages of division and how these
interactions regulate aPBP functions. A second set of questions center on the mechanisms that organize and
regulate the septal and elongasome PG synthase nanomachines. We will determine mechanisms that organize
circumferential motion and nodal distributions of PG synthases at midcell. We will also determine the assembly
pathway of the septal divisome in early-divisional cells and the mechanisms by which the septal and elongasome
PG synthesis machines separate and are regulated later in division. We will continue studies of newly discovered
mechanisms that link PG synthase functions to the availability of PG precursor metabolites and to second
messengers. A third set of questions concerns the roles, interactions, and regulation of the FtsEX:PcsB
hydrolase in PG remodeling and the MpgB and MpgA muramidases in PG-chain release in septal and
elongasome PG synthesis, respectively. Altogether, this project will fill in major knowledge gaps about the
dynamics, functions, and regulation of aPBPs, about the organization and regulation of septal and elongasome
PG synthesis, and about PG remodeling and hydrolysis in S. pneumoniae, add significantly to the PG synthesis
field in general, and reveal additional vulnerabilities and targets for new antibiotic and vaccine development."

Metals are essential micronutrients that are required for proper functioning of cells and organisms, and their
distribution and speciation (the metallome) is tightly controlled by complex homeostatic machinery. Deviations
from metal homeostasis are associated with multiple pathologies, environmental metal contamination, and metal
deficiencies, which all have important effects on cellular function. The metallome is defined by two main metal
ion pools: the labile metal ion pool in which metals are weakly bound and exchangeable and the tightly-bound
metal ion pool in which metals are ligated to biomolecules with high affinity. Metalloproteins that constitute the
tightly-bound metal ion pool represent one third of the proteome and within these proteins, metals have diverse
structural and catalytic functions. These metalloproteins exist in several metalation states, including apo (metal-
free), holo (metal-bound), and mismetalated. These states are controlled by several factors, including metal ion
availability and the presence of metal transporters or metallochaperones. The Que lab is interested in studying
how the metalation state of metalloproteins in the cellular environment responds to changes in metal ion
availability and other biological stimuli. There are several broad questions that drive our research: (1) are there
biological or abiological scenarios in which metals in metalloproteins are labile and exchangeable rather than
tightly-bound, making these proteins vulnerable to metal ion loss or demetalation? (2) What factors govern how
vulnerable a metalloprotein is to demetalation? (3) How does this knowledge impact our understanding of the
biological function of these enzymes and their relation to human health and disease? Our strategy to tackle these
questions is to develop fluorescent probes that allow us to monitor metalloprotein expression and metalation
dynamics in live cells. We specifically target metalloenzymes due to the important chemical reactions they
catalyze and the presence of an open coordination site in their active site that can be targeted using metal-
binding, inhibitor-inspired fluorogenic molecules. In the previous granting period, we demonstrated our ability to
produce fluorescence turn-on probes for the ubiquitously expressed carbonic anhydrase (CA) and antibiotic
resistance enzyme New Delhi Metallo-𝛽-lactamase (NDM). These probes revealed that CA-bound zinc is not
labile in cells whereas NDM-bound zinc is labile, with metal loss being observed after NDM-expressing E. coli
were treated with metal chelators. In the next five years, our first goal is to improve the properties of our
fluorescent probes to increase their sensitivity and enable multiplexed imaging. Our second goal is to target
additional metalloenzymes in order to expand our biological scope and elaborate on our probe design principles.
Our third goal is to further explore the lability of zinc sites in three clinically relevant metallo-𝛽-lactamases,
including NDM, and the consequences of this lability on antibiotic resistant infections, the nutritional immunity
response, and therapeutic strategies. Metalloenzyme probes developed as part of this award also have potential
applications in diagnostics and high-throughput drug screening for pathologies associated with these species."

The objective of this proposal is to gain mechanistic and pathological understanding of human GlcNAc-1-
phosphotransferase (PTase), an enzyme which modifies lysosomal hydrolases. Lysosomes contain several
dozen acid hydrolases that break down unwanted proteins and lipids. Lysosomal enzymes acquire a mannose-
6-P moiety in the Golgi apparatus by the action of PTase, which uses UDP-GlcNAc as a donor substrate. The
mannose-6-P functions like a zip code that guides the delivery of these enzymes to the lysosomes. PTase is
encoded by the GNPTAB and GNPTG genes and assembles a 340-kDa heterohexamer of α2β2γ2. PTase
selectively modifies lysosomal (but not non-lysosomal) glycoproteins transiting the ER–Golgi system. It has
been unclear how PTase catalyzes the GlcNAc-P transfer reaction and how it distinguishes lysosomal from
non-lysosomal glycoproteins. Mutations in the genes encoding PTase cause mucolipidosis II and III and lead to
abnormal body structure, mental retardation, and several neurological diseases. In preliminary studies, we
have determined the atomic structure of the catalytic core of the dimeric α2β2 subcomplex in the apo form. We
have identified an inhibitory hockey stick motif that moves in and out of the catalytic pocket in the absence of
substrates. We have also derived a nm-resolution cryo-EM 3D map of the holoenzyme. Building on these
strong preliminary studies, we propose to determine the structures of the catalytic core bound to the donor
substrate UDP-GlcNAc and the acceptor substrate mimic α-methylmannoside, and to perform structure-guided
mutagenesis and in vitro activity assays. These structure-function studies of the catalytic core will enable us to
formulate the unique phospho-glycosyl transfer reaction mechanism. We also propose to carry out systematic
mutational and functional assays to examine the many reported disease-causing mutations. Finally, we
propose to study the structures of a large lysosomal hydrolase-binding peripheral region and the γ-subunit of
the PTase holoenzyme and to explore how they interacts with selected substrate lysosomal hydrolases. The
proposed research will address the molecular mechanism of a key signaling pathay in glycobiology and will
provide molecular insights into how mutations in the PTase cause the associated human diseases."
10844598,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) still results in hundreds of
thousands of new pediatric HIV infections every year, especially in resource-poor areas of the world where
access to antenatal/postnatal antiretroviral therapy (ART) is limited. Sadly, in the absence of ART, >50% of HIV-
infected infants die by 2 years of age. Since ART alone will not be sufficient to end the morbidity and mortality
associated with HIV/AIDS in children, there is an urgent need for developing practical interventions to prevent
and treat pediatric HIV infection. To that end, this project will evaluate the potential of gene therapy with the
potent and extremely broad HIV inhibitor eCD4-Ig to prevent and treat perinatal HIV infection. eCD4-Ig is a
chimeric molecule consisting of the outer domains of CD4, an IgG Fc portion, and a co-receptor mimetic peptide.
eCD4-Ig has unmatched breadth and very potent effector activities against HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV. The eCD4-Ig
gene will be delivered to infant rhesus macaques (RMs) via adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene
transfer. AAV vectors are safe and can transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells. Critically, AAV-driven
transgene expression in long-lived cells, such as those of skeletal muscle, can last for years, possibly decades.
While AAV-mediated delivery of eCD4-Ig has been shown to protect adult RMs against challenge with pathogenic
immunodeficiency viruses bearing highly divergent Envelope proteins, this approach has never been tested in
infants. We have recently partnered with the Farzan lab to characterize the kinetics of eCD4-Ig expression in
infant RMs treated with AAV/eCD4-Ig at birth. Compared to adult animals, AAV/eCD4-Ig-treated newborn RMs
experienced substantially higher levels of eCD4-Ig and lower levels of antibodies against the eCD4-Ig molecule.
Note that these anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) are highly detrimental to AAV-mediated delivery of immunoglobulins
because they can clear the molecules from circulation, thereby reducing the efficacy of this approach. The low
levels of ADAs observed in the AAV/eCD4-Ig-treated infants is consistent with previous reports of neonates
developing tolerance to AAV-delivered transgene products. Given the ability of AAV vectors to promote sustained
transgene expression after a one-time administration, and the unique window of opportunity offered by the
neonatal period to achieve robust AAV-driven expression of eCD4-Ig in vivo, we postulate that AAV-mediated
delivery of eCD4-Ig to infants can prevent and treat postpartum HIV infection. In specific aim (SA) 1, we will
characterize the safety profile of AAV/eCD4-Ig in infant RMs. In SA 2, we will determine if neonatal delivery of
AAV/eCD4-Ig can prevent oral acquisition of SIVmac239 in RMs. In SA 3, we will assess if AAV-mediated
delivery of eCD4-Ig to SIV-infected infant RMs can control viral replication without ART. If successful, the
proposed experiments will build the pre-clinical foundation for testing AAV-mediated gene therapy with eCD4-Ig
in infants as a means to prevent and treat perinatal HIV infection."

 This new R01 application entitled “Is prenatal alcohol exposure a risk factor for the onset and progression of
AD/ADRD?” is submitted in response to RFA-AA-20-006 “Impact of Alcohol on the Onset and Progression of
Alzheimer's Disease and Its Related Dementias”. The overarching goal is to test the novel hypothesis that
prenatal alcohol exposure may be a risk factor for predisposing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's
Disease-Related Dementia (ADRD). Indeed, the literature is replete with epidemiologic discussions of alcohol
consumption in the adult as a risk factor for AD/ADRD. However, the biological underpinnings of prenatal
alcohol exposure are distinct from those of adult alcohol consumption. To date, epidemiologic studies have not
mined the prospect that prenatal alcohol exposure may be a predisposing factor for developing AD/ADRD.
Thus, this proposal rides on the premise that, whereas preclinical and clinical studies have linked prenatal
alcohol exposure to certain neurodevelopmental brain disorders, whether or not it is a potential risk factor for
developing later-life, adult-onset cognitive disorders, notably AD/ADRD, warrants investigation. To this end, we
propose three aims, employing age-matched male and female 3xTg-AD mice and leveraging our combined
expertise in investigating the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on corticogenesis, cortical form and function
and behavioral testing.
Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that a binge-type prenatal alcohol exposure of 3xTg-AD fetuses early in gestation
disrupts corticopetal tangential migration of primordial GABAergic interneurons and their distribution in the embryonic
medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus.
Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that the aberrant tangential migration is associated later in life with a precocious
deficit in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning/memory and an exacerbated impairment in mPFC-dependent
behavioral flexibility in adult 3xTg-AD mice exposed prenatally to alcohol.
Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that the precocious deficit in spatial learning/memory and the exacerbated
impairment in behavioral flexibility in the 3xTg-AD mice with PAE are associated with (1) altered number and/or
distribution of GINs and/or (2) abnormal inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission in the
mPFC and hippocampus.
 Overall, this proposal charts an unexplored and innovative direction that carries the adverse
neurodevelopment consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure into the realm of AD/ADRD research. The
findings promise to contribute new vistas into the molecular, cellular and behavioral parallelisms between
prenatal alcohol exposure and AD/ADRD as well as their intervention and treatment."

The Pennsylvania Animal Diagnostic Laboratory System (PADLS) at the University of Pennsylvania’s New
Bolton Center offers comprehensive veterinary diagnostic services in the areas of pathology,
microbiology, molecular diagnostics, and toxicology, as fully accredited by the American Association of
Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians (AAVLD) and a first-tier laboratory member of the Veterinary
Laboratory Investigation and Response Network (Vet-LIRN). Safeguarding the animals and citizens of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania against threats to animal health and food safety, the laboratory serves
as a critical Eastern United States resource, making it an excellent fit for this Vet-LIRN project proposal.
Our laboratory is experienced in the analysis of a variety of sample and matrix types, including but not
limited to animal samples, environmental samples, vermin, water, animal drug products, and animal and
human food products and ingredients such as grain, meat, fish, and milk. We will use our laboratory’s
veterinary diagnostic experience, expertise, and infrastructure to accomplish the work described for this
project. In addition to addressing the need for added laboratory capacity in the event of a large-scale
outbreak or incident involving animal food, drug-related illnesses, or other large-scale emergency events
requiring surge capacity testing, the PADLS New Bolton Center Laboratory can further strengthen the
Vet-LIRN through diagnostic activities that better enable early detection of emerging events involving
national food safety and security and facilitate the rapid responses that can minimize harm and best
protect both human and animal health.
Our laboratory provides comprehensive veterinary diagnostic services to the Pennsylvania and the
surrounding region through federal, state, and local collaborations. Some analyses are part of normal
surveillance activities or routine necropsies, while others are associated with cases of excessive,
unexpected, or otherwise unexplainable animal losses or illness that may potentially pose a risk to
animal health and/or animal or human food safety. The laboratory adheres to AAVLD’s “Requirements
for an Accredited Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory”, meeting specific requirements pertaining
to all aspects of the laboratory and its activities. AAVLD also requires that our laboratory has a Quality
System that documents policies, systems, programs, and procedures. Due to the varied nature of the
sample matrices we receive we are constantly improving and refining our analytical methods in order to
ensure their sensitivity and specificity. We are confident in our ability to continue to support Vet-LIRN in
this project due to our present qualifications and experience and a proven history of successful Vet-LIRN
collaborations through both the infrastructure and method development grant programs."
10850962,"Project Summary
Aberrant expression of microRNAs has been found associated with pathological conditions. Over the past years
many putative miRNA-based disease biomarkers have been reported, but none of them has been fully validated
(e.g., for FDA approval). This is largely because of the lack of an analytical methodology that offers accurate,
repeatable, and cost-effective quantification of microRNAs present at very low levels in biological specimen. The
current golden standard for microRNA assay (i.e., quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction,
RT-qPCR) offers “a relative quantification” and is very high in assay cost (>$15 of consumables /per assay).
After all, all PCR-based quantitative assays deploy a calibration curve established between fluorescence signal
and the logarithm of microRNA concentration (instead of microRNA concentration), which by nature produces
less accurate quantitation results and exponentially amplifies the uncertainties contained in fluorescence signal
measurements. The goal of the research is to eliminate current limitations in quantitative assay of microRNAs,
thus fostering the biomedical research and full validation of these emerging disease biomarkers. We propose
herein a novel analytical strategy for “absolute quantification” of target microRNAs based on robust and popular
ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) in combination with affinity
magnetic solid phase extraction and isothermal signal amplification. The strategy involves the following PCR-
free workflow: 1) target microRNA is extracted /enriched from a biological sample by using an ssDNA probe-
magnetic bead conjugate; 2) solid surface polyadenylation of target microRNA captured by poly(A) polymerase
with 13C-labeled adenine; and 3) UPLC-MS/MS determination of 13C-labeled adenine after acid hydrolysis of the
extended target microRNA. The quantitative assay is expected to have the following assay characteristics: high
sensitivity (LOQs < 1pM, a physiologically relevant level), high accuracy (recovery ≥ 95%), good repeatability
(RSD ≤ 5%), the capability of single base mismatch discrimination, no need for a total RNA isolation in the assay,
and cost-effectiveness (a total cost of consumables < $1.5 per assay. Implementation of this analytical method
will have a profound impact on microRNA biomedical research.
 The project proposed fits the research concentration at Jackson State University and will be able to draw
students from the Chemistry and Biology programs. The participating students will acquire lab skills including
cell culture, biological sample preparation, instrumental analysis, and scientific data process /presentation
through research activities. In general, the project will help to develop and to sustain research excellence at JSU
(an HBCU), and thus contribute to the diversity of our future research workforce."
10851556,"SUMMARY
Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive pathogen that can infect every niche of the vertebrate host. S. aureus
infections range from minor skin infections to fatal bacteremia. In the US alone, there are nearly 900,000 cases
of severe S. aureus skin and soft tissue infections diagnosed each year. The prevalence of this pathogen and
the frequent use of antibiotics selected for antibiotic resistant strains, including methicillin resistant S. aureus
(MRSA) with resistance to the -lactam class of antibiotics. Once primarily a nosocomial infection, MRSA is now
often acquired in community settings, causing about 10% of severe S. aureus infections. These strains also
exhibit increased virulence, presenting the desperate need to develop new therapies. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a
genetic disease resulting in thicker than normal lung mucus, predisposing patients to pneumonia, especially from
S. aureus, which is present in 70% of CF patients. The immune system of healthy patients kills pathogens
through mechanisms involving the release of reactive oxidants like HOCl that oxidize and inactivate proteins
necessary for bacterial survival. HOCl kills cells through non-specific chemistry so both host and pathogen are
damaged. CF patients have an increased number of activated neutrophils in their lungs from a young age, and
the HOCl generated by those neutrophils contributes to deceased pulmonary function and shortened life
expectancy. This proposal will define the role of HOCl-induced oxidation of methionine in S. aureus physiology
and pathogenesis. The S. aureus methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msr) revert methionine sulfoxide to
methionine, repairing oxidatively damaged proteins. This process prevents the organism from needing to
synthesize oxidized proteins de novo, a significant energy savings for the cell. Staphylococci are unique among
bacterial species in having four Msr enzymes, and the role of these enzymes in pathogenesis is not understood.
The Beavers lab recently demonstrated that Msr enzymes protect S. aureus from killing by neutrophils as well
as HOCl, the primary oxidant produced by neutrophils, but not other oxidants present at the host-pathogen
interface. The CF lung is a particularly relevant setting to explore the role of Msr enzymes in S. aureus
pathogenesis because S. aureus persists in the CF lung despite high concentrations of neutrophils and a harsh
oxidizing environment. This proposal will test the hypothesis that Msr enzymes protect S. aureus during CF
pneumonia by defining the mechanisms by which S. aureus uses Msr enzymes to avoid killing by the host
immune system and determining the role of each methionine sulfoxide reductase during S. aureus pneumonia
in the CF lung. This will provide a foundation for future research focused on understanding bacterial physiology
and responses to host-pathogen oxidants. Additionally, the identified and validated pathways represent
therapeutic weaknesses in S. aureus and thus targets for the development of antibiotics that sensitize pathogens
to host oxidative killing. These discoveries will improve treatments in CF patients and healthy patients alike."
10851557,"SUMMARY
S. aureus-associated pneumonia accounts for an estimated 50,000 staphylococcal infections per
year in the United States. S. aureus is one of the leading etiologic agents of ventilator-
associated pneumonia in the intensive care environment. S. aureus pneumonia has a high rate
of mortality due to the prevalence of antibiotic resistance and the lack of an effective vaccine.
During pulmonary infection, neutrophil influx is a double-edged sword: neutrophils clear the
invading pathogens, or overzealous neutrophils may cause tissue damage leading to pneumonia.
Hence, understanding the mechanisms by which S. aureus keeps lung neutrophils at rest is
crucial to decipher how S. aureus maintains its silent colonization state and when/how its
presence becomes pathogenic. The Staphylococcal Superantigen-Like protein (SSL) family is
an example of a complex immune evasion system of S. aureus. Recently, we reported that
SSL11 mediates motility arrest in human neutrophils by inducing cell adhesion. Our preliminary
studies showed that SSL11 interacted with recombinant integrins, and integrin blocking
antibodies inhibited SSL11-induced cell adhesion and motility arrest. The main goals of this
study are: To determine how SSL11 induces cell adhesion via integrins (aim 1); To determine
whether SSL11 inhibits pneumonia by inhibiting neutrophil migration in a mouse model (aim 2).
This proposal is designed to characterize a previously under-appreciated mechanism of bacterial
toxin action to evade neutrophil function, provide insight into how S. aureus establishes and
maintains host colonization, and reveal a potential new therapy to treat pneumonia associated
with massive neutrophil migration."
10851558,"SUMMARY
The “obesity pandemic” is a major global public health issue that affects more than 40% of the US population
and is tightly interrelated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Affected people are at least 3 times more likely
to develop critical and life-threatening respiratory viral (COVID-19 or influenza) infections. A large proportion of
the current and future human population is and will be at very high risk of severely suffering from these infections.
There is an indispensable need to study the underpinning mechanisms that drive increased susceptibility in
obese and diabetic subjects. The long-term goal is to elucidate the biological mechanisms by which metabolic
diseases influence the pathogenicity of viral respiratory infections. The overall objective of this proposal is to
determine the effects of dysfunctional adipocytes and the leptin pathway in shaping pulmonary innate responses
to respiratory viral infections. Our central hypothesis is that adipocyte secreted factors and impaired leptin
signaling alter homeostatic pulmonary host responses and enhance airway/alveolar epithelial permissiveness to
respiratory coronaviruses and Influenza virus A infections, with consequently increased lung injury associated in
part with higher viral replication. The rationale for this project is that the dissection of such responses is likely to
yield a strong framework whereby new therapeutic approaches targeting the leptin pathway can be developed
to ameliorate the impact of these infections in at-risk patients. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing
two specific aims: 1) investigate the influence of healthy and dysfunctional adipocytes and leptin signaling in
bronchial and alveolar air-liquid interface cultures following viral infection; and 2) investigate the contributions of
leptin signaling on pulmonary innate responses and its effects on clinical outcome, viral replication and lung
injury following in vivo Influenza A and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Under the first aim, human airway and alveolar
cultures on an air-liquid interface will be exposed to conditioned media derived from healthy and dysfunctional
human adipocytes and probed with siRNAs to dissect different components of the leptin pathway. For the second
aim, leptin receptor-STAT3 signaling-deficient, leptin receptor-SOCS3 signaling-deficient, and leptin receptor-
deficient mice will be employed to mechanistically understand the role of the leptin pathway in in vivo pulmonary
responses to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus A. The proposed research is innovative as it combines in vitro
and in vivo tools to mechanistically probe the leptin signaling pathway and understand its role in pulmonary
responses to viral infections, a substantive deviation from what is currently known. The proposed research is
significant as unravelling the precise role of the leptin signaling pathway during respiratory viral infection will
allow the identification of host pathway intervention points for precise intervention strategies to combat these
infections in at-risk obese and T2DM patients."
10851559,"SUMMARY
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the leading cause of hospital-acquired infection
worldwide, causing approximately 14 million infections annually in the United States alone. Increasing antibiotic
resistance observed with this pathogen highlights a compelling need to identify new therapeutic targets to treat
MRSA infections. Although directly targeting pathogens with antibiotics has been a successful approach for
treating infections, many pathogens, including MRSA, eventually become resistant to these drugs. As an
alternative, immunomodulatory strategies to enhance host defenses, such as those shown to be effective against
cancer cells, have the potential for treating drug-resistant pathogen infections. The Abuaita lab recently showed
that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor, IRE1α, is a key component in innate immune defense against
MRSA in macrophages, neutrophils, and in a murine skin abscess model of infection. This work found that IRE1α
controls macrophage and neutrophil antimicrobial functions by enhancing production of inflammatory molecules
including mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (MitoROS), neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and IL-1β, all
of which are essential for resolving MRSA infection in vivo. In the lung, ER stress occurs during infection, air
pollutant inhalation, and during the development of many pulmonary diseases such as Idiopathic Pulmonary
Fibrosis and Asthma. It is not well understood how IRE1α is involved in the progression and resolution of lung
diseases. As the lung is a vital organ, macrophages and neutrophils must adequately tune their responses to
ensure effective antimicrobial function without excessive tissue damage that could inhibit gas exchange.
Therefore, investigation of IRE1α-mediated stress responses during lung infection is expected to yield valuable
mechanistic insight into the regulation of pulmonary host defenses. The primary goal of this proposal is to
elucidate the role of IRE1α in pulmonary host defenses during MRSA infection. The central hypothesis is that
infection triggers IRE1α signaling, which enhances lung innate immune effector functions, includes bactericidal
activity and production of inflammatory mediators. The following Aims are designed to test this hypothesis: 1)
Characterize the requirement of IRE1α activation and MitoROS generation to lung macrophage inflammatory
responses and 2) Elucidate whether the IRE1α circuit aids or impedes innate immune defense against pulmonary
MRSA infection. Completing this study will define the ER stress response regulatory network in lung host defense
and will lay the groundwork for further studies to reveal cellular stress targets for potential antimicrobial
immunotherapies."
10850782,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Increasing the efﬁciency of computational methods has been instrumental to extracting insight from genomic
data. Fast aligners such as MUMMER, fast k-mer counters such as JELLYFISH, fast expression quantiﬁers such
as SAILFISH and SALMON, and high-quality efﬁcient genome assemblers such as MASURCA have been crucial
to unlocking the potential of genomic and metagenomic data. Nevertheless, computation remains a time and
cost bottleneck in many application areas. Algorithmic sketching methods, such as the minimizer schemes, have
been a useful technique for achieving improved computational efﬁciency. However, despite their importance,
these sketching techniques are understudied from a theoretical perspective and underused from a practical
perspective.
We propose to design, implement, test, and validate new sketching approaches based on signiﬁcant extensions
to the successful minimizers sketching schemes, greatly increasing the ﬂexibility of these approaches and ex-
panding their use into new areas including handling high-variance or highly repetitive sequences, and providing
a new, standard sketching toolkit for genomic method designers and software implementors. These extensions,
collectively referred to as marker selection schemes, will enable faster alignment, clustering, and assembly of
genomic sequences, and will spur further computational innovation in genomic applications.
To inform and validate this algorithmic work, we propose to enhance three important and broad areas of genomic
computational methods. First, we will extend the widely-used MUMMER aligner with a number of application-
speciﬁc “modes” that exploit these new and existing sketching schemes to achieve enhanced efﬁciency and
greater sensitivity. This will ensure continued development and enhancement for additional applications of this
important computational tool. Second, we will enhance the MASURCA genome assembler with updated in-
tegration with the new MUMMER. Third, we will use the developed marker selection schemes and additional
algorithmic ideas based on geometric embedding of sequences to develop more accurate, fast estimators of
distances between genomic sequences. These approximate distance estimators are essential for a number of
metagenomic applications including species classiﬁcation, clustering, and search. We will advance the compu-
tational accuracy of these tasks through these improved estimators.
This project will result in a deeper toolbox of genomic sketching and distance estimation algorithms, software
libraries encoding these new algorithms for wider use by the community, and an improved suite of genomic
software, including enhancements to a widely used aligner and assembler and improved accuracy in existing
and new metagenomic software."
10850872,"Various environmental/behavioral factors can influence brain development and subsequent cognitive and be-
havioral functioning. Among factors contributing to optimal neurodevelopment are the richness of the postnatal
environment and caregiving quality, both of which have been shown to affect brain, behavior, and social devel-
opment of offspring. Environmental exposures however, have the ability to derail neural and cognitive/behav-
ioral development, with lifelong negative consequences. Developmental exposure to lead (Pb), an important
public health problem, can affect all populations, however, members of low socioeconomic status (SES) com-
munities are at higher risk of exposure, sustain the highest blood Pb levels, and have adverse outcomes that
are potentially more severe. The effects of low SES on cognitive and behavioral development are multifactorial
but variations in parental care and quality of the home environment appear to play important roles. How these
factors act individually and interact to modulate the brain’s epigenetic and transcriptional responses to Pb ex-
posure and affect cognitive/behavioral outcomes has not been examined. Previous studies from our lab and
new preliminary data show that DNA methylation in the hippocampus (HIPP) and frontal cortex (FC) and trans-
criptional profiles in HIPP are modulated by the quality of the postnatal environment and by Pb exposure, as
are associative learning and memory and executive functioning. However, the impact of quality of maternal
care has not been examined as an effect modifier in experimental studies of Pb neurotoxicity nor have the
combined influences of maternal care and the quality of the post-weaning social environment been studied.
Preliminary data show for the first time that quality of maternal care is an important effect modifier of the toxic
influences of Pb exposure. Data suggest that different early life experiences may modify the expression of cog-
nitive and behavioral deficits produced by developmental Pb exposure and may do so through further altera-
tions of methylation and transcriptional profiles initially modified by Pb exposure. The proposed studies will
investigate this through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Examine the extent to which variations in social en-
vironment and quality of maternal care independently or jointly modify cognitive/behavioral outcomes in males
and females with developmental Pb exposure; Aim 2: Identify critical gene-level methylation changes in HIPP,
FC, and AMYG (using Methylation Dependent ImmunoPrecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) and Methylation-
sensitive Restriction Enzyme digestion sequencing (MRE-seq)) and transcriptional/functional network changes
(using RNA-seq) that are affected by developmental Pb exposure and the extent to which altered profiles can
be modulated by quality of maternal care and/or environmental enrichment. These studies will provide new in-
formation on how environmental/behavioral factors may interact to influence neurodevelopmental vulnerability
and resiliency following Pb exposure and provide information relevant to understanding the biological bases of
social/behavioral interventions that are translationally relevant for improving outcomes from Pb exposure."

The aim of this grant is to identify, validate, then target for therapeutic intervention, regulatory elements within
the 5’ untranslated regions (UTR) of protein coding genes, known as upstream open reading frames (uORFs).
In so doing, we aim to modulate the protein output from selected genes, offering a novel, translational
approach with broad potential, that we will first test in the context of animal models of hereditary diseases. To
achieve the goals of our integrative MultiPI R01, we will leverage the expertise of both our labs spanning
computational modeling, genomics, genetics, RNA biology, molecular biology, and animal work. In Aim 1 we
will combine large genomic and genetic datasets including gnomAD, the PennMedicine BioBank, and the
UKBioBank to systematically identify functional uORFs and prioritize those for validation. The resulting
database of human uORFs will be made publicly available and widely accessible as a user-friendly web-tool.
Predicted regulatory uORFs suggested by the Aim 1 pipeline will be fed into the experimental Aims 2 and 3. In
Aim 2 we will validate the high-priority uORF targets using luciferase assays and in Aim 3 we will test the
modulation of these uORFs as a potential for therapeutic intervention. The results of Aims 2 and 3 will be fed
back to the pipeline of Aim1 to improve prioritization of future uORFs. Overall, we expect the resources and
discoveries made by this grant to shed light on the functional role of uORF and offer therapeutic avenues for
several hereditary diseases."
10849079,"The overarching goal of this proposal is to create conditional gene animal resources for modeling human
health and disease in zebrafish through improved genome editing tools. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is second only
to mouse as the most commonly published model system for human health. In 2023, NIH supports over 150
Principal Investigators in >200 Research and Resource Zebrafish projects (>$80 million) across 19 institutes.
Zebrafish possess high fecundity for genetic studies and optically clear embryos for live imaging and
visualization of developmental processes. Readily accessible methods have been established to modify gene
expression or edit the genome by injection of reagents into the single cell embryo. Zebrafish is increasingly
used for post-embryonic and adult models of disease and regeneration, requiring strategies for inducible
genetic manipulation with tight spatial and temporal control across the lifespan. The ability to fully utilize this
powerful animal model is limited by a lack of tools for tissue and cell-type specific gene functional studies,
reproducible and accurate transgene expression, and reliable integration of nucleotide variants and short
sequences into the nuclear genome. Epigenome regulation and energy metabolism are rapidly emerging areas
impacting development, disease, and regeneration, yet few zebrafish genetic alleles are available to study
either in zebrafish. Moreover, the ubiquitous expression of epigenetic and nuclear mitochondrial genes
requires conditional alleles to model tissue and organ specific pathologies associated with these fundamental
biological processes. For zebrafish to remain at the forefront of animal models that address the research
mission of institutes across the NIH, innovative methods are needed for precision genome editing and
expanding the conditional genetic toolbox to these understudies areas. Building on our pioneering strategies in
zebrafish genome editing, the improvements and conditional genetics resources we propose to develop here
will have a significant, lasting impact on zebrafish. We propose the following aims: Aim 1. Expand the
zebrafish community resource for Cre recombinase conditional gene studies to established fields of
zebrafish studies (embryonic development, major tissues and organ systems) and understudied, rapidly
emerging areas (epigenetics, mitochondrial biology). Aim 2. Further develop and improve methods for
precision targeted integration to increase the accessibility of our GeneWeld and DonorGuide methods for
integration of long DNA fragments and short sequences. Aim 3. Continue development and distribution of
targeted integration resources to the zebrafish community through seminars, conferences, social media, and
virtual and hands on training. We expect by the end of the funding period to significantly expand our Cre and
conditional allele resource. Our methods to improve GeneWeld and DonorGuide precision genome editing in
zebrafish will be widely applicable, given the near universal application of CRISPR genome editing in model
and non-model systems."

Meharry Medical College is continuing its mission in training underrepresented minority students for diseases
that disproportionately impact underserved communities. As the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted, infectious
diseases continue to cause a global humanitarian and economic burden. The most effective way to combat the
continued emergence of infectious diseases is to have a robust drug development pipeline at the ready. The
training for scientists in this drug development pipeline to combat infectious diseases needs to include structural
biology and students traditionally underrepresented in biomedical sciences. To strengthen professional and
scientific skills to enhance scientific productivity, particularly in the field of structural biology of human pathogens,
novel programs, such as the one proposed are needed.
The proposed HBCU/MSI Mentored Research Program in the Structural Biology of Human Pathogens is a 10-
week summer program will provide an intensive, hands-on research experience for students (community college,
undergraduate, medical) that will deliver training and education in the structural biology of infectious disease
proteins. Research training will be provided by a diverse faculty consisting of experienced structural biology
investigators from Meharry Medical College and Vanderbilt University Medical Center. A nationwide search will
be conducted to select 10-16 students per year who are interested in pursuing careers in medicine and
biomedical science related to NIAID. Student research projects will focus on structures on human pathogens,
provide by our partnership with Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Diseases (SSGCID). Student
education will encompass the fundamentals of structural biology provided in a mini-course and mentored
through the solving of protein structures. This exciting and innovative program will give each student participant
the full workflow of solving a protein structure from prediction to expression all the way through to structure
determination and publication. As a collaborator, Black In Biophysics will assign a Career Mentor to each
participant and students will participate in career development workshops to explore career options, create
individual development plans, and obtain information needed to apply and successfully gain entrance into Ph.D.
and M.D. training programs.
At the end of the 10-week program, students will have an opportunity to create oral and poster presentations
describing their research and present their research findings internally during the Summer Research Symposium
and externally at one national conference. Program directors and staff will track participants through their
undergraduate/medical and post graduate training to evaluate the extent to which program goals were met and
identify areas for improvement. Evaluations from research mentors and program directors/chairs will also be
used to assess and improve the program."
10848643,"The training and retention of the next generation of vision scientists was a major goal in the
2021 NEI strategic plan, with a stated mission to “Inspire and train a talented and diverse next
generation of individuals to expand and strengthen the vision workforce”. In line with this
mission, this T32 renewal application requests support to increase our Interdisciplinary Vision
Sciences (IVS) training program to four predoctoral and two post-doctoral positions annually for
years 16-20. Predoctoral trainees drawn from seven interdisciplinary graduate programs will be
supported for one year, extendable to two by fair competition annually. Postdoctoral trainees are
drawn from our preceptors’ laboratories. Our training plan includes multidisciplinary aspects of
the visual system, ranging from study of single molecules to the mechanisms underlying
ophthalmic diseases and cognitive processing of the visual input. All trainees take an intensive 3
credit semester long course “Biology of Vision” that is team-taught by faculty and IVS preceptors
and includes basis of grantsmanship and grant writing skills as a pathway to independence.
Training is supplemented with monthly meetings that encompass subjects ranging from science
communication, aspects of professional development, issues regarding rigor, reproducibility and
the responsible conduct of research, and the development of mentoring relationships. The plan
further details the exposure of trainees to a broader appreciation of basic vision research
through seminar series of invited speakers, faculty, and the trainees themselves. Every trainee
is required to present their scientific work at least yearly. Clinical exposure is also mediated by
requiring attendance to weekly UPMC Vision Institute Grand Rounds, and the annual ”Vision
Research Day” where all in Ophthalmology meet for a day of clinical and Basic research
discussions. The plan involves 18 preceptors with secured funding from three schools in two
universities that have a diverse range of vision science research programs. Preceptors receive
training themselves in the mentor-mentee relationship. Our program is the only vision training
program in Pittsburgh to offer a broad appreciation of vision science and the interdisciplinary
aspects of vision research. The past 10 years saw most IVS trainees succeed and remain in
research-intensive or -related careers in academia and industry. Several have subsequently
secured independent grant funding. We feel that this justifies the continuing T32 support from
the NEI so that we can add to the next generation of vision scientists and researchers."
10832620,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading mode of epilepsy related death. Recent
estimates indicate that SUDEP is responsible for approximately 7,000 deaths each year in the United States
and Europe, and is the second most common cause of the number of adult life years lost after stroke. To
accelerate SUDEP research, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) at the NIH-
funded Center for SUDEP Research (CSR), a network of 14 institutions collaborating in a broad spectrum of
basic science and clinical approaches to study possible biological mechanisms underlying this potentially
preventable mortality and develop predictive biomarkers for interventions. Identification and communication of
alterable SUDEP risk factors to affected patients is an important strategy to lower SUDEP incidence.
However, systematic individualized assessment of SUDEP risk is currently unavailable due to a number of
challenges. Often the required information is embedded in data residing in disparate, unlinked datasets and
systems; there is a lack of a specific controlled vocabulary for precise extraction of SUDEP risk factor
information with semantic uniformity; and the corresponding computational algorithms and tools needed for
important risk marker extraction from clinical text and electrophysiological signals are yet to be fully developed.
We propose to overcome these challenges by developing SURME, a SUDEP Risk Marker Extraction system
for automated extraction of known and putative SUDEP risk markers from the multimodal CSR data repository
(called MEDCIS) which contains over 1,600 patients enrolled from Epilepsy Monitoring Units in 7 medical
centers. In Aim 1 we will develop a dedicated controlled vocabulary building on our own Epilepsy and Seizure
Ontology and existing SUDEP risk guidelines and reported risk factors. We will develop an extraction pipeline,
leveraging our earlier epilepsy phenotype extraction tools, for detecting risk markers from clinical text. In Aim 2
we will develop a scalable approach for detecting two significant putative physiological biomarkers from
electrophysiological signals: postictal generalized EEG suppression; and root mean square differences of
successive R-R intervals. In Aim 3 we will perform pilot implementation of SURME on MEDCIS for automated
risk assessment using “SUDEP-7 Inventory” and “SUDEP and Seizure Safety Checklist”, as well as
assessment of putative SUDEP risk factors using CSR cohort. We expect SURME and its future versions to
become an invaluable SUDEP risk assessment tool as a part of standard epilepsy care. The long-term goal of
this study is to create evidence-based SUDEP risk assessment tools to improve epilepsy care, with
individualized risk scores and recommendations for managing modifiable risks, ultimately leading to reduced
SUDEP mortality and improved epilepsy patient care."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among U.S. women, accounting for approximately
1 of every 3 female deaths. Cumulative evidence has identified pregnancy complications as well as fertility
measures, as CVD risk factors. However, there is very limited knowledge on the impact of environmental
exposures during pregnancy and both short and long-term maternal cardiovascular and metabolic health.
Environmental chemicals with potential cardiometabolic impact include phthalates and organophosphate (OP)
flame retardants, which widespread use leads to ubiquitous general population exposure. Experimental studies
demonstrated that both phthalates and OP flame retardants bind to human peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptors (PPARs), a master nuclear receptor that is involved in lipid metabolism regulation. Among subfertile
women enrolled in the Environment and Reproductive Health (EARTH) Study, we observed worse pregnancy
outcomes, including decreased live birth rates, increased pregnancy loss and elevated glucose levels during
pregnancy, with increasing urinary concentrations of phthalate and/or OP flame retardant metabolites.
However, it is unstudied whether phthalate and OP flame retardant exposure during pregnancy is associated
with long-term (midlife) maternal cardiovascular and metabolic health. We propose to evaluate associations of
preconception, pregnancy and midlife urinary phthalate and OP flame retardant metabolite concentrations
(individually and as a mixture) with long-term cardiometabolic health (anthropometry, glucose and lipid
metabolism, blood pressure and inflammatory biomarkers). We will also identify the most important window(s)
of exposure associated with cardiometabolic health, evaluate the joint and interactive effects of urinary
metabolite concentrations and modifiable lifestyle risk factors for CVD (BMI, diet, physical activity, smoking)
with cardiometabolic health, and investigate trajectories of cardiovascular health outcomes from pregnancy to
midlife. We embed our proposal within the EARTH Study (2004-2021), a cohort of subfertile couples attending
a single fertility center to identify environmental predictors of reproductive health. Strengths of EARTH Study
include collection of urine samples both before and during pregnancy and its comprehensive and rich database
of covariates. We will contact and re-enroll former female EARTH participants who will provide additional urine
samples comprising the midlife window of exposure for phthalate and OP flame retardant metabolites and we
will assess their current health status. Women with impaired fertility are at higher risk of CVD, thus this
proposal provides an exceptional opportunity to explore cardiovascular and metabolic health among women
within the well-established EARTH Study, which so far, has focused on fertility, pregnancy and offspring
outcomes. Results from the proposed series of investigations will inform clinical care for women from the
reproductive years through midlife, CVD guidelines regarding screening and long-term follow-up, and future
research priorities."

The most common neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s
diseases, all display distinct clinical presentations. The basis of these distinct clinical presentations is the
enhanced vulnerability of specific neuronal cell types to death or dysfunction in each disease, despite
widespread expression of disease-associated genes. My work uses innovative approaches to address these
long-standing questions of enhanced vulnerability, which have remained open questions in the field for
decades. I was centrally involved in developing a widely used cell type-specific profiling methodology known as
translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) that allows cell type-specific RNA profiling. My lab has recently
developed a new genetic in vivo screening platform for the CNS, a powerful new approach for brain studies as
it allows for systematically testing the causal effect (versus correlation) of each gene in the genome for disease
phenotypes, rather than more standard approaches that test a single gene per animal. Additionally, using
single cell sequencing approaches, we have also conducted the largest single cell studies of Huntington’s
disease patient tissue conducted to date. These studies have collectively revealed the scope of transcriptional
dysregulation in Huntington’s disease and Huntington’s disease model tissue, and also have implicated
neuronal innate immune activation as a likely key driver of cell type-specific vulnerability in Huntington’s
disease. My long-term research goal, starting with Huntington’s disease as a model disorder, is to elucidate the
basis of enhanced vulnerability in neurodegenerative disease, not only as a window for discovering valuable
insights into the cell biology of disease-relevant neuronal cell types, but also identifying new therapeutic
targets."

Concussive injury or mild/moderate TBI (mTBI) accounts for a large majority of the brain injuries in USA and
compromises neuronal function and cognitive abilities that can last for years. Neurons that survive the initial
insult show a decline in function, and one of the most intriguing aspects of mTBI is that many patients become
vulnerable to secondary injury or neurological disorders, which underlying instructions are hiding in alterations
of gene programs. The lack of information how TBI alters gene regulatory programs that govern pathogenesis
has precluded major advances in strategies to guide TBI therapeutics. Traditional medicine relies on
manifestations of symptoms and phenotypes rather than causative factors of the pathology. Instead, alterations
in the program of genes are likely causative factors of the pathology and can reveal therapeutic targets that can
support precision medicine initiatives. We have recently implemented the use of single-cell genomic analysis to
elucidate the impact of TBI on cell types, genes, pathways, and cell-cell interactions that can help inform on
novel targets for therapy. Our results from single-cell genomic analysis point to cell metabolism as a driver of
mTBI pathogenesis at the cell level and has helped us to prioritize thyroid hormone (important metabolic
modulator) as a potential therapeutic agent. The underlying hypothesis is that treatment with thyroid hormone
T4 can activate gene regulatory mechanisms that control functionality of circuits in brain regions important for
processing of higher order information. Leveraging the expertise of Dr. Xia Yang in genomics and systems
biology, and Dr. Fernando Gomez-Pinilla in TBI, we will utilize state-of-the-art parallel single cell sequencing
(drop-seq) to assess changes in gene expression in cells forming circuits in brain regions related to cognitive
processing. A unique aspect of our project is the implementation of highly sophisticated genomic procedures to
understand unsolved questions in the field of neural repair and plasticity and to monitor the efficacy of treatments,
using basic concepts of precision medicine. Astrocytes supply energy used by neurons, and they play a crucial
role in the incorporation of thyroid hormone from blood into neuronal cells, and according to our preliminary data,
astrocytes are highly vulnerable to TBI. We will modulate astrocyte activities to probe the role of astrocytes on
circuit reorganization after TBI and on the effects of thyroid hormone. Our studies have the promise to open new
avenues to mitigate mTBI pathology based on cell-specific functional aspects of gene regulation, which is also
a main premise for precision medicine initiatives."
10832965,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the signature wound of Veterans returning from Operations Iraqi Freedom,
Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation New Dawn (OIF/OEF/OND), with up to 20 percent exposed to a
mild TBI (mTBI) and experiencing persistent post-concussive symptoms. Among those with a mTBI diagnosis,
the majority also suffers from stress-based psychopathology (e.g., depression, post-traumatic stress disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder), as well as chronic pain. To cope with distress, pain, and other difficulties,
Veterans often turn to maladaptive avoidant coping strategies which offer short term relief but
exacerbate/maintain mental health problems and have detrimental long-term effects on social, occupational,
and community reintegration. Unfortunately, Veterans face significant barriers to engaging in mental health
treatment, including stigma, the belief that one should overcome psychological difficulties on his/her own, and
concern that receiving such care would negatively impact their careers. Practical barriers, including time
constraints, distance from a treatment facility, and competing priorities (e.g., work and family demands), are
also barriers to care. Even among Veterans who start mental health treatment, only a small minority complete
a recommended course of evidence-based therapy.
 Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a trans-diagnostic treatment model that helps patients to
overcome avoidance by promoting acceptance-based coping and engagement in meaningful life activities. In
this context, Veterans are asked to think about their “new mission(s)” after leaving the military and the
importance of engaging in actions that fulfill their mission even when it may be difficult. ACT has established
efficacy in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and chronic pain, and has been effectively implemented in
various treatment-delivery formats, including 1-day group workshops. A 1-day ACT workshop addresses
specific needs of Veterans with mTBI, stress-based psychopathology, and chronic pain (polytrauma triad) and
important barriers to treatment. It 1) is trans-diagnostic (i.e., applies to more than one condition); 2) targets
avoidance-based coping; 3) cultivates acceptance-based coping and builds on Veteran’s values and goals to
motivate them to make difficult decisions; 4) is delivered efficiently and thus more accessible; 5) is less
stigmatizing and thus acceptable; and 6) address problems with treatment adherence and completion.
 With the support of an RR&D SPiRE pilot grant, the PIs developed a 1-day ‘ACT on Life’ workshop tailored
specifically for the needs of Veterans with mTBI, stress-based psychopathology, and chronic pain. Veterans
with this polytrauma were then randomly assigned to the ‘ACT on Life’ workshop (N=20) or to Treatment as
Usual (TAU; N=12). All Veterans attending the 1-day ACT workshop completed it, and relative to TAU,
exhibited greater improvements in distress and reintegration at the 3-month follow-up (effect sizes .68 and .47,
respectively). Building on these promising preliminary findings, we now propose to conduct a more rigorous
randomized controlled trial with 212 Veterans to compare the efficacy of the 1-day ACT workshop to an active
treatment comparison (Education, Resources, and Support; ERS) on symptoms of distress and social,
occupational, and community reintegration. We will also examine mediators and moderators of treatment
response to identify which ACT components are directly responsible for treatment effectiveness and whether
treatment benefits are constrained by various personal factors.
 Establishing the efficacy of a 1-day ACT workshop for OEF/OEF/OND Veterans with mTBI and multiple
coexistent conditions addresses key priorities of VHA RR&D: 1. developing interventions which will improve the
psychological health status of Veterans who have specific needs; and 2. enhancing the community, social, and
occupational reintegration and functioning of post-deployment Veterans so that they may function more fully in
society."
10833078,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Transposable elements (TEs) are omnipresent genomic parasites, comprising >70% of the nuclear
DNA in certain lineages. In addition to producing deleterious mutations, TEs can exert lethal, genotoxic effects
on host cells by causing double-stranded breaks during insertion and excision. Host genomes have two
mechanisms for avoiding the fitness costs of parasitic TEs: resistance and tolerance. Mechanisms of
resistance reduce TE load by repressing transposition, while mechanisms of tolerance reduce the fitness
consequences of existing TEs. While resistance to TEs is studied extensively, with small-RNAs in particular
emerging as a taxonomically widespread strategy, tolerance is a new concept that I have recently proposed.
Furthermore, through an innovative QTL mapping experiment, I provided critical proof-of-principle for tolerant
genetic variants in Drosophila melanogaster. In the future, I propose to build on these recent discoveries to
expand our understanding of tolerance mechanisms and evolution.
 First, we will study the mechanism and recent evolutionary history of bruno-dependent tolerance to P-
element DNA transposons. Bruno is a developmental regulator of oogenesis, which we have recently
demonstrated is a major determinant of female germline tolerance to unregulated P-element transposition. By
combining genetic analysis of mutant alleles, as well tolerant bruno variants we have isolated from natural
populations, we will reveal the underlying mechanism of bruno-dependent tolerance. Furthermore, by taking
advantage of the unique opportunity provided by historic D. melanogaster collections, we will evaluate the
contribution of bruno tolerant variants to the host adaptation to the P-element invasion in the mid 20th century.
 My second research direction is motivated by our discovery that natural variation in heterochromatin is
an important determinant of how cells are impacted by unregulated transposition: larger doses of
heterochromatin and reduced heterochromatin formation decrease cellular tolerance. These observations are
reminiscent of Barbara McClintock's “genomic shock” model, in which tremors arising from DNA damage or
cellular stress trigger the release normally quiescent repeats. I therefore propose to interrogate the relationship
between heterochromatic variation and response to genotoxic stress at both the cellular and regulatory levels.
 My long-term goal is to reveal complex and intimate relationships between TEs and their hosts, which
contribute to genome evolution and shape the evolution of gametogenesis. A better understanding of these
interactions is of vital importance because: 1) they are the interface at which TEs and host cells coevolve, 2)
TE activity is implicated in the onset, progression of many tumor types and age related neurodegenerative
diseases, and 3) vast differences in TE content and distribution between host genomes remain largely
unexplained."

in early auditory processing in Sz are indexed by impaired tone matching and auditory plasticity, as well as by
impaired generation of mismatch negativity (MMN) and reflect dysfunction within subcortical and cortical

10838418,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Primary Immune Deficiency (PID) is a debilitating condition that affects one in 1,200 persons in the US.
Although PID has been historically perceived to predominantly affect non-Hispanic white population, emerging
evidence suggests stark disparities in the diagnosis of PID among racial and ethnic minorities. Of note, while
past reporting of PID found that the majority of patients were non-Hispanic whites, implementation of newborn
screening for certain types of PID found no difference in disease prevalence in any ethnic group. Differential
access to diagnostic testing and specialty care, as well as diagnostic bias rooted in the prevailing belief that
PID primarily affects non-Hispanic white population, may have contributed to the underdiagnosis of PID among
minority populations. To date, there remains scant data on the risk factors of diagnostic delay in minority
patients with PID, and there are currently no published studies investigating impediments to diagnosis and how
they can be addressed. Delay in the treatment of PID can result in serious health problems, including organ
damage and death. There is therefore an urgent need to address disparities in the diagnosis of PID.
Our long-term goal is to improve timely diagnosis and treatment of PID in underserved populations. To achieve
this goal, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Identify patterns of diagnostic delay in PID among racial
and ethnic minorities; (2) Identify barriers to early diagnosis of PID among racial and ethnic minorities; and (3)
pilot a targeted intervention to improve awareness of disparities in PID diagnosis. We will combine analyses of
electronic health record (EHR) data (Aim 1) with qualitative analysis of patients’ lived experience and real-
world perspectives from healthcare providers to understanding barriers to early diagnosis of PID (Aim 2).
Additionally, we will apply advanced machine learning analysis as an innovative approach to enable a more
comprehensive understanding of the patterns of diagnostic delay. PID is a complex group of diseases with
highly variable clinical manifestations. We anticipate that the application of machine learning methods to EHR
data can facilitate identification of under-recognized patterns of diagnostic delay and will enable us to learn
from large clinical datasets in a scalable manner. Integrating knowledge from these analyses, we will then
develop and evaluate an educational outreach program targeting healthcare providers to raise awareness of
the disparities in PID diagnosis experienced by minority groups (Aim 3). The study will be conducted at 2 major
healthcare systems in Massachusetts: Mass General Brigham and Boston Medical Center.
This body of work represents the first systematic effort to investigate the patterns of, and barriers to, early
recognition of PID among minority populations in the US. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed pilot
educational outreach program will be the first educational initiative aimed at addressing PID diagnostic
disparities in the US, and will provide a foundation towards our longer-term goal of designing and developing a
regional/national educational program to improve diagnosis of PID among minority populations."
10838420,"Latinos in the U.S. experience significant disparities in access to mental health services due to lack of 
health insurance, cost of services, limited awareness of mental health resources, mental health stigma, and 
fear of deportation. Limited English proficiency coupled with an acute lack of bilingual and culturally competent 
providers further impede Latinos’ adequate access to quality mental health services. The COVID-19 pandemic 
has only amplified the need for mental health care and exacerbated mental health disparities for Latino 
communities, making it urgent to identify low-cost, effective strategies to reduce these gaps. This 5-year 
project seeks to develop and test a multi-level, community intervention to improve mental health 
outcomes and promote access to culturally appropriate mental health treatment for Latino 
communities in Philadelphia. CRISOL Mente will include components at various levels of the socio-ecological 
model: a clinic-based, stepped-care program relying on Latino lay health workers (LHW) for the delivery of 
mental health services (Aim 1), outreach and education activities to reduce mental health stigma in the 
community (Aim 2), and efforts to strengthen Latino-serving organizations’ capacity to address mental health 
and other syndemic conditions contributing to untreated mental health among Latinos (Aim 3). To improve 
mental health symptoms and engagement in care, we will recruit, train and supervise a cohort of Latino LHW 
who will be embedded into two Latino-serving clinics, extending the reach and effectiveness of the clinics’
mental health services. We will compare the impact of three different levels of LHW involvement: a) 
community outreach/navigation (i.e. screening and referral of community members); b) auxiliary care (i.e. 
screening, referral, and help overcoming barriers to better mental health); and c) task shifting (i.e. screening, 
referral, assistance, and supervised delivery of basic mental health treatment). The LHWs will also conduct
outreach/education activities in the community (e.g. radio talks, info sessions, tables in community venues)
to reduce mental health stigma. Our experienced and largely Latino community-academic research team will
also engage in capacity building activities (i.e. monthly town halls, annual retreats, weekly newsletters, 
provision of trainings and technical support) with the Latino Health Collective, a coalition of Latino-serving 
organizations. Using mixed-methods and the RE-AIM framework, CRISOL Mente’s impact will be evaluated 
with clinical data, baseline and 6-month patient survey data (N=200 from each level of LHW involvement), and 
qualitative interviews with community members (N=30) referred to mental health services by the LHW (Aim 1); 
pre/post mental health stigma data from two respondent driven sampling (RDS) surveys of Latinos (N=400 
each) conducted in 2022 (preliminary study) and in 2027 (Aim 2); community capacity indicators from three 
surveys of Latino-serving organizations conducted in 2019, 2021 (preliminary studies) and 2027, and key

great promise for addressing cancer screening disparities, as it reduces multi-level barriers to care. Our

improve colorectal cancer-related care delivery and reduce disparities in telehealth access and care by
developing and testing telehealth tools and technologies using novel research methods. This research will use
rapid methods and adaptive-evaluation processes and will apply the Health Equity Implementation Framework
and components of the Reach Effectiveness-Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, with
an emphasis on effects on disparities in implementation and evaluation. PRIME will assess neighborhood-level
social determinants of health and adapt and optimize a telehealth-solution to improve the quality, reach, and
effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening in predominantly Latinx clinic populations aged 45-54 (Aim 1); test
technical and communication solutions that use video-text messages to educate patients about colorectal
cancer screening, link them to community-based services, and provide personalized navigation to support to
improve uptake of screening and follow-up care, using a pragmatic stepped-wedge design (12 neighborhoods;
3,000 patients aged 45-54; Aim 2); and assess multi-level moderators of program effectiveness (including
neighborhood-level social determinants of health, ethnicity, and preferred language) and organizational-level
barriers and facilitators to implementation; and scale-up the program across neighborhoods and partnering
clinical practice sites (n = 4; Aim 3). This project will leverage local resources and strengthen connections

sustainment. To ensure the project’s success, we have assembled an engaged group of community partners,
including payers, health centers, community-based organizations, and patients, along with a multi-disciplinary

 Medically tailored meal (MTM) interventions are of rapidly growing interest to healthcare systems, payers,
patients, and policy makers. MTMs are fully prepared, nutritionally customized, and generally home-delivered
healthy meals for individuals living with advanced and costly diet-sensitive conditions, such as diabetes, heart
failure, end stage renal disease, HIV, and cancer. Meal plans are designed by a registered dietitian nutritionist
based on diagnoses and nutritional assessment. Several preliminary studies have suggested that MTM
programs can reduce healthcare utilization and healthcare costs for high-risk patients. Impacts on obesity,
glucose control, and related health outcomes have not been evaluated. This collaborative initiative will assess
the impacts of MTMs on obesity, diabetes control, blood pressure, healthcare utilization, and healthcare costs

10850894,"Abstract:
It is well established that quiescence or dormancy preserves the self-renewal and long-term reconstituting
potential of long-term HSCs (LT-HSC). HSCs that are quiescent give rise to much higher reconstitution than
proliferating HSCs in transplant recipients, and signals that drive HSCs into proliferation cycle often lead to HSC
differentiation and exhaustion. However, the mechanisms that coordinate HSC quiescence, proliferation and
differentiation remains to be investigated. Recently, we and others reported that protein homeostasis at
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays important role in preserving HSC functions under stressed condition. However,
it remains to be investigated whether protein quality control is important for HSCs under steady state, when the
majority of HSCs remain in a deeply dormant state with profoundly reduced protein synthesis rate and metabolic
activity. ER associated degradation (ERAD) is a critical component of protein homeostasis, and ensures protein
quality control by degrading inappropriately folded or assembled proteins in ER. ERAD complexes recognize
misfolded proteins in ER and translocate them to cytosol for proteasomal degradation. Our preliminary studies
indicate that protein quality control via ERAD governs HSC quiescence and self-renewal. The Sel1L/Hrd1 ERAD
genes are enriched in the quiescent and inactive HSCs, and conditional knockout of Sel1L in hematopoietic
tissues drives HSCs to hyper-proliferation, which leads to complete loss of HSC self-renewal and HSC depletion.
ERAD deficiency via Sel1L knockout induces a non-apoptotic ER stress and activates all three main pathways
of unfolded protein response (UPR). Furthermore, we found that mTOR signaling is activated in Sel1L knockout
HSCs and inhibition of mTOR via rapamycin rescues Sel1L knockout-induced HSC defects. We therefore
hypothesize that Sel1L maintains HSC quiescence and self-renewal by restricting mTORC activity. Here, we
propose three aims to determine the mechanism by which ERAD modulates mTOR signaling to preserve HSC
quiescence and self-renewal: 1) Determine the role of Akt/mTOR signaling branches in Sel1L-mediated HSC
regulation; 2) Dissect the interaction of ERAD and UPR signaling; and 3) Determine the role of Rheb in ERAD
deficiency-induced HSC dysregulation. These studies will establish Sel1L/Hrd1 ERAD as the master regulator
of HSC quiescence, and provide novel insights into how protein quality control systems coordinate with
proliferation signaling pathways to determine HSC fate."

As both a Native-American serving, non-tribal institution and minority serving institution in poor,
rural southeastern North Carolina, the U-RISE program at the University of North Carolina at
Pembroke aims to increase the number of our diverse and disadvantaged students who pursue
a terminal degree in biomedical or behavioral science and ultimately enter the biomedical
research workforce. In order to accomplish this goal, we aim to recruit 6 trainees annually from
underrepresented (UR) or disadvantaged backgrounds and provide them with two years of
research training and experience with passionate faculty preceptors (for a total of 12 trainees
supported each year). Research training will include basic skills such as lab safety and
documenting experiments but also in communication skills, both written and oral, through
practice writing abstracts, direction in reading primary sources, and presenting research in the
form of elevator talks, poster and oral presentations. In addition, the trainees will be retained
due to the formation of a strong cohort and supported by a three-pronged mentorship approach
from peers, program leadership and research faculty. Furthermore, career exploration and
development will aid in their retention by giving the trainees a more concrete picture of their
future. Setting and accomplishing goals will be modeled through the development and
monitoring of an individual development plan (IDP). To increase retention and resiliency in
graduate training, trainees will take part in workshops and activities aimed at helping them
develop coping and self-care strategies and increase self-efficacy and science identity.
Recruitment of trainees will be facilitated by a pre-U-RISE summer research experience open to
all students in the included majors. As a result of these activities, we expect that at least 90% of
the RISE Fellows will graduate with a BS degree in biology, chemistry or physics and at least
75% of RISE Fellows will have entered a biomedical research graduate program within 3 years
after graduation. The evidence-based interventions in the research training program will
successfully prepare UNCP graduates to be confident, competent and experienced candidates
to enter and succeed in biomedical research careers."

biomedical enterprises of academia, government, and industry is relatively homogeneous. One way to
remedy this is for science communities to be intentional and specific in how equitable, inclusive, and diverse
scientific environments are fostered to welcome and support different perspectives. Current practice of
science creates the “diversity-innovation paradox.” Research demonstrating that rigorous, impactful science
and improved innovation result from diverse and inclusive workspaces, yet creative thinkers from Historically
Excluded Communities (HECs) are too easily excluded and their contributions valued less highly. Not
currently available to undergraduate students and their faculty mentors at NMSU is a program that blends
training in critical thinking laboratory skills, support in a multitude of relevant professional proficiencies, and
intentional community building among scholars from diverse cultural and academic backgrounds with
scientifically trained faculty mentors and staff. A two-year research education program is bolstered by an
inclusive and affirming educational seminar series built into students’ curriculum. Complementary activities
focus on knowledge, skills, and confidence in four major areas: basic research skills, quantitative-based
approach to analyze and solve problems, scientific communication skills and development of a science
identity. This application requests funds to train forty-five undergraduate scholars over five years. NMSU
can achieve this goal because of the institution's unique status as a doctoral, research-intensive, land grant,
minority (Hispanic) serving university with a diverse student population, a cadre of accomplished mentors, a
growing collaboration among different university units focusing on postbaccalaureate education of NMSU
students, and a strong institutional record of successfully increasing the diversity of trainees in the biomedical
sciences nationwide. This application introduces innovative elements that are evidence-based interventions
that 1) strengthen the students’ understanding of the ethical norms in scientific research by applying critical
thinking skills and a quantitative-based approach to analyze and solve problems (Aim 1); 2) Implement a
curriculum that addresses development training skills in management, inter-personal communication,
presentation, and promotes faculty-student relationships to be grounded in open communication, support
and allyship – all practices which foster a scholar’s science identity (Aim 2); and 3) Cultivate the interface
between biomedical, social, environmental, and agricultural scientific fields that relate directly to human
health and well-being by increasing the inclusion of students from other colleges into biomedical research
experiences like the levels observed in the college of Arts and Sciences (Aim 3)."

Patterns of reproductive health, fertility, investment in children, morbidity, and mortality vary substantially by
age, race, ethnicity, gender, economic status, and other axes of stratification—a reality that emerged
particularly clearly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The methods and approaches of population science, which
are rooted in the tools of demography but draw also from empirical approaches of biostatistics, epidemiology,
and economics, are essential for understanding the causes and consequences of these patterns of population
health and well-being. In this renewal application, we propose continuation of the multidisciplinary and
interdisciplinary Population Science Training Program housed at the Carolina Population Center. The goal of
the program is to train the next generation of population scientists to conduct critical research on the causes
and consequences of population change and the implications for health and well-being across the globe.
Cross-disciplinary collaboration and hands-on involvement in innovative population science research are
defining features of our program. Our training faculty represent 11 different academic departments, roughly
balanced between social science and public health disciplines; our trainees themselves are equally diverse.
The predoctoral program combines disciplinary PhDs with a strong grounding in population science through
coursework, seminars, and workshops and a mentored research practicum with one or more faculty members
that continues throughout training. The postdoctoral program is structured around a close mentoring
relationship between the training faculty and postdoctoral scholars, customized to fit the goals and interests of
both. We seek continued support for seven predoctoral trainees and two postdoctoral scholars, a level well-
justified by the competitiveness of the current program and the outstanding productivity and placement of prior
trainees. With substantial guidance from the training director, training manager, and their faculty preceptors,
trainees in our program leave with the subject matter expertise, interdisciplinary orientation, team science
approach, data skills, and population perspective to conduct creative and rigorous research to improve human
health and well-being in the US and beyond."
10848897,"Early life medical intervention, such as occurs in the neonatal intensive care unit, saves infant lives, but also is
a significant risk factor for subsequent emotional, mood and sensory dysfunction, including chronic pain.
Critically, there is mounting evidence of significant sex differences in NICU outcomes, with greater mortality
and gross neurological dysfunction in males and greater risk of internalizing disorders in females. However,
the mechanisms underlying these sex differences are largely unknown, a key gap in the literature. Our long-
term goal is to understand the neurological substrates that underlie the different effects of neonatal pain and
stress on vulnerability to negative affect disorders, including chronic pain, during the juvenile period in male
and female rats. To accomplish this, we will expose neonatal rats to NICU-like treatment including a series of
repetitive paw pricks which results in a latent vulnerability. Our central hypothesis is that the underlying
neuro/endocrine mechanisms differ between the sexes. For example, we have previously demonstrated that
exposure to a subsequent “activating” stressor during the juvenile period unmasks alterations to negative
affective behavior and pain thresholds in both sexes following neonatal pain. However, the neurobiology
underlying these changes differ. For example, Corticotropin Releasing Factor (CRF)-containing cells within the
central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) are particularly responsive during neonatal trauma and are reduced in
number later in life, but only in male rats. Females, although also affected by neonatal pain, do not appear to
undergo the same changes in the amygdalar CRF system. Importantly, however, intra-amygdala CRF1
antagonists can reverse the hypersensitivity in both sexes. Thus, while CRF-expressing cells in the CeA are
only involved in male rats, CRF receptors are involved in both sexes, suggesting involvement of a non-
amygdala source of CRF in females. Preliminary data point to the hypothalamus. To better understand these
differences, we propose a series of innovative experiments to identify the behavioral and brain changes
underlying the different effects of neonatal pain in male and female rats. Specific Aim 1 proposes hi-plex in
situ hybridization and florescent immunohistochemistry designed to assess changes in neuropeptide gene
expression and cellular phenotypes in the amygdala and hypothalamus to examine differences between male
and female rats exposed to NICU-like experiences. While the function of some individual genes and
biomarkers have been established, many cells co-express several neuropeptides and the various overlapping
expression patterns of these neuropeptides has not been studied. Specific Aim 2 looks for changes in
neuronal activation patterns in identified cell types in the amygdala and hypothalamus and correlates this with
changes in behavior, using immediate early gene signaling as a proxy for neuronal activation. Together, these
experiments will fill in critical gaps in our knowledge regarding sex differences in the lasting consequences of
neonatal pain."
10849348,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Muscular dystrophies (MDs) occur world-wide affecting all races with an estimated combined prevalence of ~20-
25 per 100,000. Muscle mass is ~65-85% of our body and there are many genetically distinct MDs that affect
different body muscles. While mechanistic studies led to some promising therapeutic strategies to slow disease
progression, these options are still limited and there is essentially no cure for MDs. Thus, it remains critical to
understand the disease mechanisms and utilize the knowledge to develop innovative therapeutic strategies. At
University of California, Irvine (UCI), we have strengths in 4 areas of muscle and MD research: (1) muscle
immune response/inflammation, (2) muscle regeneration/stem cell biology, (3) epigenetics and gene regulation,
and (4) robust clinical and translational research (with strengths in development of biomarkers, natural history
studies, validating outcome measurements for interventional studies, and therapeutic development). Together,
we believe we can build a robust training program to move the field forward. The major objective of this T32
grant is to cultivate future muscle biology and MD researchers through multidisciplinary training. Mentees will be
three predoctoral students and one postdoctoral fellow per year. The T32 program will be affiliated with a newly
formed Muscle Biology and Disease Research Center at UCI. UCI is a site for one of the highest number of
clinical trials in the US for muscle-related therapy (immune myopathies, muscular dystrophies and rare and
ultrarare genetic non-dystrophic muscle disorders). Eighteen mentors have complementary expertise in
genomics, epigenetics, immunology, stem cell biology, tissue engineering and clinical research. Each trainee
will be co-mentored by a clinician and a basic scientist. The trainees’ development will be supported through
didactic teaching, journal club, seminar series, and research in progress meetings on campus as well as
opportunities for research presentations at national and international conferences. The T32 program also
provides rigorous training for responsible conduct of research and data reproducibility as well as support for
career development. Trainees also have opportunities/exposure to the multidisciplinary muscle clinics at UCI
(UCI hosts thematic half day clinics in muscular dystrophy, myositis, Pompe Disease and GNE myopathy). There
will be opportunities to engage in activities with patient advocacy groups and industry, which would be important
to help mentees to understand the impact and the process of possible application of their research in the MD
community. Our goal is to train the next generation scientists who can perform rigorous translational research
to help MD patients."

The PI proposes a high-impact multidisciplinary research project investigating the effects of brain microvascular
anatomy and function on neuronal and glial plasticity in a mouse model of peripheral neuropathy.
Chronic pain is a heavy burden for the individual and society, affecting 30% of the adult population in the USA,
and presenting with multiple co-morbid psychiatric disorders, including mood alterations and cognitive
impairment. One pivotal mechanism that could explain the chronification of pain as well as its resistance to
classical treatment is the concept of pain centralization, where initial sensory events can gradually alter the
central nervous system, resulting in amplified pain and/or aberrant pain that exists without peripheral
sensitization. Alterations in brain circuitry have been well reported across a spectrum of pain conditions, such as
complex regional pain syndrome, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, and migraine, thus prompting the quest for
treatments that could reset these systems. However, most of the research in this area overlooks the evolving
brain microvascular changes that may parallel cellular plasticity.
Our long-term goal is to delineate brain vascular alterations (permeability, anatomy, and perfusion) and the
associated changes in neurons and glia that parallel the progression of peripheral neuropathy. This approach
goes beyond attempting to mask the experience of pain via pharmacotherapy (including addictive opioid
treatment) and seeks to understand the mechanistic underpinnings of pain chronification via (mal)adaptive brain
alterations. Specifically, we aim to 1: Characterize the anatomical and histological signs of blood-brain-barrier
permeability following peripheral neuropathy. 2: Identify changes in brain micro-vascularization following
peripheral injury. And 3: Characterize the effect of brain vascular plasticity on neuronal and glial abundance and
function.
While it is understood that pain is a subjective experience that ultimately resides in the brain, there is no
characterization of how an injury to the limb causes long-term brain alterations, and for many patients, a lifetime
of pain and suffering. This proposal outlines a path by which trauma to peripheral tissues can cause long-lasting
behavioral and brain plasticity via vascular mechanisms.
This proposal will enhance the infrastructure of research and education at Queens College, introducing
biochemical and biomedical research experiences to underrepresented minority and female students, who would
otherwise lack such opportunities. This would allow them to experience a broad spectrum of techniques, and
acquire skills such as small animal surgery, behavioral testing, and advanced biochemical analyses."
10852970,"This project will seek to define the relative risk contributions of microbial and genetic factors to the
development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) within a cohort of high-risk multiplex (3 first-degree relatives
affected) IBD families. Candidate: The primary objective of this application is to support Dr. Elizabeth
Spencer’s career development into an independent, patient-oriented investigator in the field of prevention and
personalized medicine for IBD patients. Dr. Spencer’s career goal is to become an independent researcher
and leader in the application of risk stratification and prevention for IBD. Dr. Spencer’s proposed training
activities are in five areas: 1) microbiomics, 2) metabolomics, 3) computational genomics and metagenomics,
4) longitudinal cohort building, and 5) leadership. To achieve this, she has assembled a mentoring team led by
Dr. Marla Dubinsky, Co-Director of the IBD Clinical Center at Mount Sinai and Chief of the Division of Pediatric
Gastroenterology, an expert in IBD risk stratification, Dr. Judy Cho, Ward-Coleman Professor, Vice-Chair of
Genetics & Genomics & Gastroenterology, and Director of the Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized
Medicine (IPM) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), an expert in the genetics of IBD, and
Dr. Jeremiah Faith, Associate Professor of Genetics and Genomic Sciences and Clinical Immunology and
Director of the Microbiome Translational Center, an expert in microbiomic analysis. Environment: The ISMMS
has a strong tradition of outstanding research and is one of the top 20 medical schools in NIH funding. The
Mount Sinai Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology is an international leader in IBD research and clinical care.
Research: IBD is a heterogenous set of chronic inflammatory disorders that arise from the complex interplay
of genetic, environmental and microbial factors, and immune responses. These complicated interactions arise
before the identification of overt disease, making it difficult to tease out the causative factors behind disease
inception given the need for a pre-clinical, high-risk cohort. The Multiplex Families Research Program at
ISMMS provides a unique cohort of affected and unaffected members of multiplex families with IBD to examine
the relative contribution of these factors. Dr. Spencer’s preliminary observations in this cohort have shown that
siblings with IBD tend to cluster together in birth order, likely due to some environmental sharing, which could
be attributed to microbial changes. We would like to explore this further by characterizing the microbial and
genetic contributions to familial IBD to improve stratification of those at high-risk for developing both pre-clinical
and overt IBD. Therefore, our specific aims are (1) to define the features of microbial and metabolomic profiles
in sibling clusters of IBD and their association with genetic risk and (2) to develop an IBD risk score
incorporating genetic, microbial, and metabolomic factors with validation in a similar, external cohort. The
general approaches and skills developed during this award can be applied to further IBD risk stratification and
continued exploration of possible inciting environmental triggers for those at high-risk for IBD."

Insects are extremely prone to dehydration, where individuals may succumb after exposure to only a few hours
of dry conditions. Mosquitoes are highly susceptible to desiccation due to high water loss rates, especially
when temperatures are high, relative humidity is low, and drinking water is lacking. Importantly, if dehydrated
mosquitoes move to more humid areas, dehydration-induced phenotypes can last for many hours. Recent
studies have examined mosquito development and other specific topic areas under dry season conditions, but
no integrative studies have examined the role of dehydration bouts on mosquito behavior, physiology, and
potential for disease transmission. For most insects, exposure to xeric periods prompts their retreat into
favorable microhabitats until conditions improve, which could take hours or weeks. Our preliminary studies
indicate that activity and blood feeding in mosquitoes increase by three- to four-fold following sub-lethal
dehydration, but the potential mechanisms and impact of this phenotype are unknown. The focus of this
proposal will be examining the effect that dehydration has on mosquito biology, specifically how desiccation
stress alters general mosquito biology, host choice, host-pathogen interactions, and disease transmission. The
primary study organism will be the northern house mosquito, Culex pipiens, a vector for West Nile virus, with
comparative studies to mosquito species to Aedes aegypti. These studies are supported by 1) experimental
designs that can discern the effects between only exposure to dry conditions and direct mosquito dehydration
(= organismal water loss), 2) preliminary studies on CRISPR-Cas9 lines of chemosensory proteins which show
altered water attraction, 3) shifts in blood feeding and diversion of blood to the crop, 4) increased retention of
the bloodmeal in dehydrated mosquitoes when compared to hydrated counterparts, 5) differential expression of
immune genes following a bloodmeal if mosquitoes are dehydrated before host feeding, and 6) field-based
mesocosm experiments that indicate dehydrated mosquitoes are more prone to blood feeding.
This study has four specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Influence of dehydration on basic biological parameters
before and after blood feeding. Specific Aim 2. Examine aspects underlying behavioral modifications of
mosquitoes following dehydration stress. Specific Aim 3. Impact of dehydration on viral retention and
transmission. Specific Aim 4. Field-based observations and mathematical modeling of disease transmission
changes due to dehydration exposure. Overall goal accomplished by the completion of these proposed
studies: These proposed studies will be transformative by providing the first integrative experiments that
examine the effects of dehydration bouts on the dynamics between mosquito physiology, behavior, and
pathogen transmission."
10852972,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Simple purine–pyrimidine (Pu/Py) repeats (PPRs) are known to form the left-handed, fragile Z-DNA structure.
Such repeats are also known to be highly mutagenic, inducing large chromosomal deletions and rearrangements
in the cells of higher organisms. The mutagenic effects of Z-DNA would be the most detrimental to a species if
breaks occurred uncontrollably in the germ line and mutations occurring at unrepaired breaks were passed on
to the next generation. We discovered a novel biological process in the mammalian germ line that controls Z-
DNA structure at PPRs. Using the Zbtb43 mutant mouse genetic model and our transgenic mouse line that
allows us to isolate germ cells, we found that a previously uncharacterized DNA binding protein, ZBTB43
remodels Z-DNA structure and protects from double-strand breaks in fetal male germ cells in vivo. By
biochemical assays we found that ZBTB43 binds to PPR-rich DNA sites in the genome in vitro. ZBTB43 binding
sites form Z-DNA and cause large genomic rearrangements in mammalian cells. By in vivo epigenome mapping
we detected Z-DNA in mutant germ cells at the locations where ZBTB43 binding occurs in wild-type
prospermatogonia. We hypothesize, therefore, that ZBTB43 safeguards genome integrity in the germ line by
binding and eliminating Z-DNA at PPRs. In addition, we found that by eliminating Z-DNA, ZBTB43 promotes de
novo methylation at PPRs during the time of global epigenetic remodeling. We propose to pursue the following
Aims, using a combination of genetic, cell biology, biochemistry, and epigenomic approaches. In Aim 1, we will
test the working hypothesis that ZBTB43 eliminates Z-DNA structure in vivo by directly binding to PPRs in fetal
male germ cells. We will determine 1) the spatial and temporal changes of the Z-DNA structure in fetal male
germ cells in the presence or absence of ZBTB43 protein in vivo; 2) the dependence of the Z-DNA remodeling
process on the direct binding of ZBTB43 to the Z-DNA structure in vivo; and 3) the molecular requirements of
ZBTB43 action on Z-DNA. In Aim 2, we will test the working hypothesis that ZBTB43 facilitates de novo DNA
methylation in prospermatogonia indirectly by eliminating Z-DNA, thus revealing the sequences as substrates
for de novo methyltransferases. We will map DNA methylation in the presence and absence of ZBTB43 during
the epigenome remodeling process in fetal male germ cells. We will test whether de novo DNMTs methylate Z-
DNA substrates in vitro. We will test whether ZBTB43 affects nucleosome occupancy at PPRs. In Aim 3, we will
test the hypothesis that Z-DNA is mutagenic in the germ line and that ZBTB43 has evolved to manage that
burden. We will map double-strand breaks in mutant fetal germ cells, test the anti-mutagenic effect of ZBTB43
in cell culture, and search for genomic rearrangements in sperm of Zbtb43 mutant males. By the end of the grant
period, we will have identified and characterized the first example of how a DNA binding protein protects genome
integrity and targets de novo DNA methylation by controlling Z-DNA structure in the mammalian germ line."
10853095,"Project Summary
Cochlear implant (CI) electrode arrays are made of platinum (Pt) wires and contacts encased in
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, silicone) housing. These materials provide mechanical stability and flexibility
critical to the long-term function of the device. However, they also induce a foreign body response and fibrosis
that have detrimental effects. For example, the fibrotic capsule that eventually encases all CI electrode arrays
leads to increased impedances and signal broadening which decreases the effectiveness of the device.
Further, intracochlear fibrosis is implicated in the loss of acoustic hearing that can occur months to years after
implantation. As candidacy for CI is rapidly expanding, including many patients with significant residual
hearing, there is an urgent need to understand the fundamental processes that lead to intracochlear fibrosis.
Macrophages are recognized as key, central regulators of the foreign body response to biomaterials in other
tissues and our preliminary data demonstrate vigorous macrophage recruitment following implantation of CIs.
We hypothesize CI biomaterials activate macrophages leading to the recruitment of fibroblasts and
fibrosis/encapsulation of the biomaterials and that electrical stimulation modulates this macrophage response
dependent on the stimulus level and timing of onset. In Aim 1, in vitro culture models are used to explore the
differential effect of PDMS and Pt on macrophage recruitment, activation, and regulation of cochlear fibroblast
proliferative and synthetic functions. Aim 1 also investigates the temporal and spatial activation and recruitment
of macrophages following cochlear implantation using a reporter mouse model. Aim 2 examines the role of
macrophages in fibrosis/neo-ossification following cochlear implantation. First, we test the requirement of
macrophages for intracochlear fibrosis following CI using a mouse line that allows conditional and selective
depletion of macrophages. Next, implanted mice are treated with a specific CSF1R inhibitor to deplete
macrophages as a preclinical translational model. Finally, a CX3CR1 null mouse is used to determine the
effect of fractalkine signaling on post-CI fibrosis. Aim 3 determines the effects of varying levels of electrical
stimulation and effects of timing of electrical stimulation onset on macrophage recruitment and intracochlear
fibrosis. The proposed work provides a rigorous investigation of the effects that specific biomaterials, insertion
trauma, and electrical stimulation exert on macrophage responses and the regulation of the fibrosis in the
cochlea. The long-term impact of the work is to identify specific, effective, and durable strategies to limit
fibrosis following CI or other injuries to the cochlea."

Advances in single particle cryo-EM have transformed structural biology of ever-expanding
biological systems. We request funds to purchase a Glacios 2 cryo-TEM (Thermo-Fisher) at the
Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The goal is to enable users throughout the Institution,
working on different biological and disease mechanisms, to measure cryo-EM data at home, as
well as provide a seamless transition for atomic resolution data collection on Titan cryo-TEMs at
nearby NYSBC-MEMC and NCCAT. The microscope is equipped with a new generation Falcon
4i direct electron detection camera, and an ancillary vitrification device for the preparation of
cryogenic grids. Importantly, the microscope features 200 kV X-FEG optics, and an Autoloader
for cryogenic manipulation and loading of the biological samples. A suitable site for installation
has already been identified, and as a proof of the Institution’s commitment to establishing cryo-
EM, the Dean, Dr. Dennis Charney has agreed to lease the Glacios 2 under Thermo-Fisher’s
“bridge-to-grant” mechanism with no obligation to buy, and no lease payment until 12 months
after installation. Besides the construction costs, the institution is also deeply committed to all
other associated costs in establishing cryo-EM at Mount Sinai, including yearly service contract,
IT infrastructure, consumables, and salary for a cryo-EM manager. The success of this S10
application will help to meet a significant portion of the cost in establishing an expensive cryo-EM
facility at Mount Sinai that is absolutely crucial for the continued success of our NIH-funded
investigators, allowing them to fully partake in this new “resolution revolution” in structural biology.
The Glacios 2 cryo-TEM majorly enhances the NIH-funded research projects of numerous
investigators throughout Mount Sinai studying a wide range of biological systems that underpin
human diseases."
10850454,"Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) often results in legal blindness and is caused by more than 100 genetic mutations,
making its development challenging to address all causes with gene therapy. FDA approval of gene therapy for
LCA addressing RPE65 mutation has sparked great enthusiasm and hope for developing gene therapy.
However, classical gene replacement or gene-editing-based sight-saving therapies are applicable when
photoreceptors do not degenerate. Current systems, however, are limited by poor resolution and retinal
damage over a period. Most current clinical treatments are primarily focused on slowing down the progression
of the disease, as there is neither a cure that can stop the degeneration nor a therapy other than retinal
prostheses that can improve vision loss due to retinal degeneration. However, the electrical stimulation devices
are invasive and require complex implantation surgeries. We have investigated ultrasound stimulation for the
retina as a modality for treating retinal degenerative diseases. However, significant challenges in translating
this technology include (i) the requirement of high-intensity ultrasound and (ii) the lack of cell-specific
stimulation. By sensitizing specific retinal cells (e.g., retinal ganglion cells that are intact in RP) toward
ultrasound using the heterologously-expressed mechanosensitive channel, the sonogenetic stimulation-based
approach may provide an alternative therapeutic modality to restore visual function in the degenerated retina.
Nanoscope has screened and engineered mechanosensitive channels (EMC) from different microbial species,
which upon expression in mammalian cells and retina, allows sonogenetic stimulation by ultrasound with
intensity orders of magnitude lower than that required without EMC sensitization. EMC is activated by any
mechanical force that causes stretch and deformation of the lipid bilayer, such as stretch, pressure/suction,
and ultrasound, as measured by pressure clamp and electrophysiology. RGC-specific EMC delivery combined
with external US stimulation has generated restoration of visual function in the RP mice model. In the proposed
project, we aim to utilize sonogenetic stimulation using ultrasound array transducers for achieving vision
restoration in the photoreceptor-degenerated retina. This goal will be achieved through the following aims: Aim
1: In-vitro assessment of the efficacy of EMC by use of focused ultrasound stimulation, Aim 2: In-vivo
assessment of low-power ultrasound stimulation of EMC-sensitized retina, Aim 3: Sonogenetic restoration of
vision in a rabbit model of Retinitis Pigmentosa. The success of this proposed project will lead to the realization
of a non-invasive sonogenetic combination therapy for vision restoration in retinal degenerative diseases."

Chronic pain due to knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a large contributor to disability, affecting over >14 million Americans. However, treatment is difficult and outcomes are poor. This is because pain is not monolithic, and differences in underlying pain mechanisms affect treatment response. While knee OA pain can be due to tissue and joint damage (nociceptive pain), it can also be augmented and maintained by central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction – i.e., centralized or nociplastic pain. Variable CNS contributions explain why some people have severe radiographic knee damage yet report no pain, while others have “normal” radiographs yet report severe pain. Our group and others have shown that this centralized phenotype occurs in nearly all chronic pain conditions. Further, we have demonstrated the clinical relevance of matching pain mechanisms with therapies, showing that a greater degree of pain centralization lowers responsiveness to interventions (e.g., opioids and surgeries) directed toward reducing nociceptive pain in knee OA. Differences in underlying mechanisms may explain inconsistent clinical trial results with cannabinoids - the active compounds in Cannabis sativa. Clinical trials suggest that cannabinoids can be effective analgesics, but this has been shown primarily with Δ[9]-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) dominant preparations, which have abuse potential. However, a recent study showed that cannabidiol (CBD) reduced pain and increased function in men with knee OA. CBD is non-intoxicating, and exerts analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. The proposed studies are the first attempt to understand how CBD and THC affect different chronic pain mechanisms by examining the effects of these compounds on knee OA in individuals with varying degrees of pain centralization. Our overarching hypothesis is that CBD will decrease peripheral inflammation, THC will modify CNS pain processing, and combined CBD+THC will do both. To test this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims. Aim 1: In a randomized, double-blinded, 2x2 factorial design study, longitudinally assess peripheral and CNS effects of CBD and THC on inflammation (interleukin 6) and neurobiological correlates of centralized pain (i.e., default mode network to insula connectivity) using a phenotyping battery of patient reported outcomes, experimental sensitivity testing, and neuroimaging that we have successfully applied to other drugs and pain conditions. Aim 2: Examine effects of THC and CBD and their metabolites on additional indices of brain connectivity and neurochemistry as well as inflammatory markers.  Aim 3 (exploratory): Assess whether pain centralization predicts differential analgesic responsiveness to CBD and THC. Given that pain centralization occurs on a spectrum in many chronic pain conditions, our approach in knee OA will act as a translational model that can be applied to nearly all other pain conditions and will have broad implications for developing non-opioid analgesics for pain management."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. Approximately 30-50% of CRC
patients develop liver metastasis (CRCLM), a major contributor to CRC-related death. As surgical resection of
CRCLM becomes increasingly routine, improving outcomes for patients post-CRCLM resection is a high priority.
Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a naturally-occurring marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid may protect
against CRC. A recent Phase II randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) by our group showed that EPA
supplementation improves survival in patients with regional cancer and CRCLM. However, the specific
mechanisms through which EPA influences post-operative survival are not well understood. Recent data from
our group and others support that the anti-CRC benefit of EPA may be mediated by its pleiotropic roles in
modulating the gut microbiota and ameliorating tumor-permissive immunosuppressive mechanisms, including
inhibition of the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and
production of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2
(CCL2). Dietary fat composition is also a major driver of the gut microbial community structure. Mice fed with a
high-EPA diet demonstrate increased abundance of gut bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus
genera, that support the host immunoprotective system and improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, and
decreased abundance of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-producing bacteria that trigger chronic inflammation and
promote CRC. These data together support our hypothesis that the prebiotic effect of EPA abrogates intratumoral
immunosuppression and ameliorates systemic inflammation to improve survival of patients with surgical
resection of CRCLM. To test this hypothesis, we will leverage our recently launched, phase III RCT of 4-g daily
EPA-ethyl ester treatment among 448 patients undergoing liver resection surgery for CRCLM (EPA for
Metastasis Trial 2, EMT2), in which participants start treatment at least 2 weeks prior to CRCLM surgery and
continue for 2-4 years post-liver resection. Using tissue specimens collected from the post-treatment liver
resection, and blood, urine, and stool samples collected at randomization, surgery, and at 6-monthly intervals,
we will interrogate immune and microbiome pathways in relation to survival. We will address causality and
characterize the mechanisms by which EPA influences the host–microbial interactions to potentiate antitumor
immunity and suppress CRCLM in a novel ‘avatar’ germ-free CRCLM mouse model humanized with stool from
RCT participants. Through these integrated investigations, our study may open new avenues for developing
EPA-based combinatorial strategies for CRC treatment. The clinical utility of this strategy is particularly
appealing due to its cost and safety advantages."

characterize the mechanisms by which EPA influences the host–microbial interactions to potentiate antitumor
immunity and suppress CRCLM in a novel ‘avatar’ germ-free CRCLM mouse model humanized with stool from
RCT participants. Through these integrated investigations, our study may open new avenues for developing
EPA-based combinatorial strategies for CRC treatment. The clinical utility of this strategy is particularly
appealing due to its cost and safety advantages."

Despite changes in the structure of contemporary families, the dementia caregiving literature provides limited
information and insights about care situations and circumstances beyond those which involve spouses and
adult children/children-in-law caregivers. Little is known about the caregiving responsibilities and practices of
a growing number of extended family caregivers (i.e., grandchildren, siblings, nieces/nephews, step-kin) who
assume the role of primary caregiver. The purpose of this research is to increase understanding of how
extended family caregivers manage care for older persons with Alzheimer's disease or other dementias (PwD)
and the relationship between their care practices and PwD outcomes. Specifically, this project aims to learn
about the strategies extended family caregivers use to manage the demands of caregiving, barriers they face
when seeking and using informal support and home and community-based services (HCBS), and how care
recipients' needs, caregivers' non-care responsibilities, and HCBS use influence the well-being of the PwD
and caregivers. The research is guided by a life course perspective and is grounded in a health behavior model
that identifies predisposing, need, and enabling factors to contextualize service utilization and well-being
outcomes for PwD and the caregiver. The research employs a mixed-methods design to provide an in-depth
understanding of the issues faced by extended family caregivers and their use of informal help and HCBS to
assist with the care of the PwD. A telephone interview that includes open-ended questions and standard items
and structured measures followed by a semi-structured 8-day diary interview focused on the daily experiences
with HCBS will be administered to 240 extended family members who serve as the primary caregivers of a
PwD living in the community (i.e., non-residential settings), plus 120 nuclear family caregivers (i.e., adult
children and spouses) for comparison purposes. Descriptive, multivariate, and qualitative data analysis
techniques will be used to address the research questions and study hypotheses. Study findings will extend
scientific knowledge about extended family caregivers and their use of informal help and HCBS beyond that
which has emerged from the literature focused on nuclear family caregivers and provide a much more
elaborated conception of caregiving that acknowledges the transformations occurring in family life today.
Understanding family circumstances and the specific responsibilities and care practices of extended family
caregivers, challenges and barriers they face when accessing HCBS, and the resultant effect on the well-being
of the PwD as well as their own well-being will provide new and highly relevant information for HCBS and
programs designed to support family caregivers."

This application is a proposal for a Fellowship training program in pediatric endocrinology, designed to provide
multidisciplinary training in diabetes research at The Barbara Davis Center (BDC), and the Children’s Hospital
Colorado (CHC) at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU AMC). It also proposes to train
post-doctoral psychologists in diabetes behavioral research. Funding is requested for two years of research
training for three Pediatric Endocrinology trainees and one PhD psychologist in each year of the Program as
well as 3 Summer Medical Students (Short-term Scholars Program). The proposal’s rationale is: 1) There is
a critical shortage of pediatric endocrinologists and psychologists trained in diabetes research 2) Diabetes is
an increasingly significant healthcare problem in the pediatric population with devastating consequences from
a personal and health economics viewpoint 3) Current rapid advances in diabetes investigation calls for an
increased pool of physician scientists trained in clinical, biochemical, epidemiological, and behavioral research
to carry out basic and translational research in pediatric type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) to bring
advances in diabetes research to the clinical arena. Psychologists training in behavioral research beside
physicians will add strength to the physician program and contribute diabetes research trained psychologists
to the very small pool of these important specialists. The BDC and CHC have an extensive and proven record
in research training of young investigators. A strong endocrinology program at CHC, in addition to a research
program in T2D, will provide a well-rounded pediatric endocrinology training program. The BDC, CHC and the
wider CU AMC have well-established investigators in the epidemiology, pathophysiology, immunobiology,
genetics, and molecular biology of T1D and T2D. This network of experienced mentors is ideally suited to
develop the next generation of young pediatric endocrinologists prepared for a career as diabetes
investigators. Areas of research focus within the BDC include developmental islet cell biology, genetics,
immunology, autoimmunity, prediction and prevention of T1D, as well as the epidemiology of and novel
treatments for T1D and T2D. The integration of psychologists training in diabetes behavioral research will add
importance and depth to the Program. These areas of research are urgently needed and have been identified
as important to the national public health to address diabetes in the US. This application is enhanced and
supported by Colorado Clinical and Translational Research Institute, the Pediatric Clinical Translational
Research Center, the CU Diabetes Research Center, the Departments of Pediatrics, Medicine and the
Colorado School of Public Health. The ability to provide strong didactic courses in statistics, epidemiology,
research methods, ethics and regulation of human research, medical writing, molecular biology and genetics,
combined with a strong mentoring faculty will allow us to provide the training required to develop pediatric
endocrinologists and psychologists into the scientists needed for the leaders of tomorrow."

 The diminishing pipeline of physician scientists is a well-established concern, and the National
Institutes of Health has established that medical students not pursuing a dual degree were more likely to
choose a research career as a result of exposure to research during medical school. By providing mentored
short-term research experiences for medical students, and aligning students with a physician/surgeon-scientist
role model, we can influence the career choices of medical students to address the deficit in the number of
physician/surgeon-scientists entering the workforce. The overall program goal of the Short-Term Research
Experiences Advancing Medical Students (STREAMS) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)
remains to provide summer research fellowships with the aim of encouraging medical students to pursue
research careers, particularly in research areas related to the mission of NIDDK.
 STREAMS provides 8-12 week mentored research experiences that encourage students to pursue
careers in academic medicine and aims to enhance the pipeline of physicians and surgeons with potential to
pursue academic careers with NIDDK-related research interests. The program boasts outstanding leadership,
an environment that promotes engagement of medical students in research, a well-funded group of trainers
with extensive commitment to medical student mentorship, a diverse pool of potential trainees, a wide breadth
of research opportunities including health disparities research, and matching institutional support. STREAMS is
currently the only NIDDK-funded T35 in the Deep South. With 5 NIDDK-funded research centers, UAB
provides excellent resources to support this program.
 The program has been tremendously successful during its initial funding period. 32 trainees
have completed the program, and an additional 8 will complete the program in summer 2023. More
than 40% of trainees have been women, and 28% from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups.
Trainees have been extremely productive with excellent success in submitting abstracts, publishing,
and receiving awards for their research. All trainees submitted and presented at local conferences, and
97% had abstracts accepted and presented at national meetings. 75% of trainees from the initial 2
years have published journal articles, while several from years -03 and -04 have already published or
are in the process of preparing and submitting manuscripts. Nearly half of trainees received awards at
local meetings, and three won national awards. 75% of trainees who completed the program more than
1 year ago have pursued additional research experience. An overwhelming majority of trainees
reported that participation in STREAMS increased their interest to include research in future career
goals. These early markers of success are clear indicators of the program’s future ability to achieve
the long-term goals of encouraging medical students to pursue research careers."

Quality monitoring is essential in psychotherapy clinical trials and for supporting the use of evidence-based
interventions (EBI) in mental health service settings, but few are available, and these require costly and
laborious procedures. Without pragmatic, specific measures of quality, it is impossible to know whether key
quality components are being delivered, and to what effect. Natural Language Processing (NLP), a type of
artificial intelligence, has extraordinary potential to reduce burden by automating the process of quality coding.
Exposure therapy for anxiety is an ideal prototype for testing automated quality coding using NLP, given its
potential for public health impact and clear theory of mechanism to guide quality measurement. Building on
pilot work, this study will refine and test automated quality coding with audio data (N =1,286 patients and
11,213 sessions) from 6 existing clinical trials of exposure therapy for youth and adults, across both research
and community settings. To enhance project efficiency and future utility of findings, we will leverage strong
existing partnerships with 1) NIMH intramural researchers bringing expertise in the quantitative study of anxiety
and deep learning methods including NLP, 2) the international Exposure Therapy Consortium (ETC), whose
mission is to support centralized tools for researchers studying delivery and mechanisms of exposure therapy,
and 3) a diverse set of stakeholders including patients/families, providers, agency leaders, payers, policy
makers, and technology developers. Specific aims are designed to validate automated coding with NLP
against human coders, test predictive utility, and incorporate stakeholder feedback to facilitate near-term
usability of findings."
10852514,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from a ruptured brain aneurysm is a life-changing condition which affects more
than 30,000 Americans at a cost of $5.6 billion annually. Even survivors with a good outcome on common
outcome scales suffer from persistent cognitive deficits. The disease affects younger people and leads to a
disproportionate loss of work-years compared to other forms of stroke. Cognitive deficits in survivors of SAH are
a major driver of the inability to return to work; however, the factors leading to cognitive deficits—and the question
of whether they can be prevented or reversed—are largely unknown. Studies using fMRI and
magnetoencephalography suggest that these cognitive deficits are associated with alterations in resting state
functional brain connectivity, an indicator of long-range neuronal network integrity.
Our group has recently observed that SAH leads to alternations in resting state functional connectivity and
behavior in a mouse model of the disease. We hypothesize that these resting state networks could serve as a
therapeutic target, independent of other kinds of additional underlying mechanisms (e.g., inflammatory, vascular,
cellular, molecular). If we can intervene on these functional networks, then it might be possible to restore normal
cognition after brain injury. We will test our hypothesis through the following aims:
In Aim 1, we will determine the effect of SAH on functional connectivity and behavior. In Aim 2, we will determine
the effect of SAH on structural connectivity. In Aim 3, we will determine the effect of brain stimulation on functional
connectivity and cognition. To accomplish the aims, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team to determine
potential mechanisms of neurocognitive deficits after SAH that includes expertise in the clinical management of
SAH, preclinical mouse models of SAH, in vivo functional optical imaging, mouse MRI, and neuronal circuit
manipulation with optogenetics and chemogenetics.
The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve cognitive deficits in survivors of aneurysm rupture. Regardless
of our findings, we will gain an understanding of the role of functional networks in cognition following aneurysm
rupture. Our hope is that intervening on these networks can lead to an effective therapy. If we are successful,
we will lay the groundwork for a cure towards neurocognitive decline following subarachnoid hemorrhage while
also contributing to a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying cognition."

Cells undergo several types of regulated cell death, often initiated by proteases in the caspase family. Once
initiated, regulated cell death activates multiple processes in the cell in order to accomplish the demise of the
cell in a regulated fashion. For example, intestinal epithelial cells undergo the process of extrusion, whereby
the cell is detached from the epithelial monolayer and ejected into the lumen of the intestine. The process of
extrusion takes about 10 minutes, and requires that the extruding cell actively participate in the process by
disassembling its cytoskeleton, reassembling a contractile actomyosin ring, and then constricting and
disassembling adhesions to neighboring cells. Thus, the cell must remain alive for about 10 minutes, and
during that short time it must complete what we term a “bucket list” of tasks that accomplish the extrusion
process. Similarly, cells undergoing apoptosis activate multiple cellular processes to disassemble cellular
structures and package them into apoptotic blebs. This takes perhaps 30-60 minutes, the time in which the cell
must complete a bucket list of apoptotic tasks. Failure to complete these bucket lists will result in a defective
form of cell death that can be pathological. We recently discovered that caspase-7, once thought to be a cell
death executioner, is actually a death delaying caspase that buys the cell time to complete these bucket lists.
Caspase-7 hyperactivates the acid sphingomyelinase membrane repair pathway, allowing dying cells to more
efficiently repair damage to their membranes. Here we study the molecular mechanisms that enable caspase-7
to accomplish this unique function."
10854734,"This is a Hybrid 1, effectiveness-implementation study of yoga-based exercise (YE) as an adjunctive tool for
rehabilitation among persons with Severe Mental Illness (SMI), defined here as schizophrenia (SZ),
schizoaffective disorder (SZA) and bipolar I disorder (BP1). SMIs are common, severe and devastating
conditions that cause enormous disability world-wide. Many features of SMI can be treated effectively, yet the
long-term outcome has not improved much over the past century. The lack of improvement may be due to
ineffective treatment of functional deficits in SMI patients, particularly in terms of community functioning,
defined here as social, leisure, employment, and life skills functioning in the community. Complementary
and Integrative Medicine (CIM) therapies that improve community functions are thus of great interest for treating
Veterans with SMI and thereby target an area of high priority for the VA. Prior studies have shown short-term
benefits of YE for improving cognitive deficits and community functions among persons with SMI. While the
published studies are encouraging, the longer-term benefits of YE are untested, particularly for community
functioning. The profile of Veterans with SMI who will accept and adopt YE is also unknown. We have
conducted pilot studies and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) for individuals with SMI in India using short-term,
simplified YE combined with medications. Recently, we also concluded RELIEVE, a RCT of adjunctive YE for
Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the USA (VA RR&D Merit award, PI: L Davis, PsyD). We
found encouraging improvements from all our studies, but our Indian and US YE protocols are impractical for
Veterans with SMI. For example, some postures may be difficult for older Veterans with amotivation and/or
physical disabilities. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will design and evaluate adaptations of the Indian and US YE
protocols in a non-religious context (mindfulness, stretching, toning and breathing exercises). We will consult our
Indian and US colleagues, our Veterans with SMI and their VA therapists to adapt the protocol for our SMI
population. We will also adapt our control condition, the Wellness Lifestyle Program (WLP), from our recently
completed RELIEVE study. In Aim 2, we will conduct a 2-armed RCT in which consenting Veterans with SMI
will be randomly assigned to one of 2 arms: YE and treatment as usual (TAU, any prescribed treatment) or WLP+
TAU. Unlike prior short-term YE RCTs, the two arms will continue 12 months, including an initial 12-week training
period consisting of two supervised sessions per week, followed by a 12-week training period consisting of one
supervised session per week, and monthly refresher training sessions offered for the remaining 6 months. We
will conform to all COVID-19 related requirements for YE and WLP. Our Hybrid 1 trial will compare the efficacy
of YE versus WLP. Primary outcomes are self-report and performance-based measures of community
functioning; secondary outcomes are cognition and physical fitness measures. Our goals in Aim 3 are to
understand demographic/clinical features of Veterans with SMI who are more likely to accept and adopt YE to
enable long-term rehabilitation, by analysis of the RCT data (Aim 3A). We will also conduct qualitative interviews
with Veterans who have SMI and participated in the YE intervention arm, referring clinicians, and the Yoga
instructor to identify barriers and facilitators for implementation (Aim 3B). The project thus aims to advance our
long-term goals for improving the quality of life for Veterans with SMI and to provide evidence to guide home-
based and over the longer term, community-based YE practice, consistent with the Mission Act and the VA
Strategic Plan. Our experience in conducting a variety of SMI research for over 25 years offers strong support
for successful completion of the proposal."
10854850,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the United States, children’s development differs markedly as a function of their family’s socioeconomic status
(SES). Some of the most pronounced and consequential SES disparities are in language and cognitive
development, which are evident as early as two years of age and, by kindergarten entry, predict with depressing
accuracy children’s long-term academic trajectories. Yet while social science has identified a variety of structural,
contextual, and psychological factors that contribute to disparities in child development, we have limited
understanding of how these factors “get under the skin” to influence biological processes that are proximally
involved in brain maturation and shape key developmental outcomes. This proposal integrates approaches to
understanding developmental disparities from the biological and psychological sciences. Theorists in the
biological sciences have proposed that disadvantage gets biologically embedded during gestation, in part via
immune responses to stress that result in “adverse gestational environments” (AGEs). Animal studies have
confirmed that stressful exposures can contribute to adverse gestational environments and to subsequent
oxidative neuronal injury and impaired development, yet human studies have yet to examine whether AGEs are
associated with socioeconomic disparities in language and cognition. We leverage an existing NIH-funded study
of disparities in perinatal outcomes, where in-depth assessments of SES and the gestational environment are
being performed in 600 pregnant individuals from diverse backgrounds. We will follow children born to these
individuals, collecting measures of cognitive and language development during the infant-toddler period as well
as preschool outcomes at age 5 years. Aim 1 will determine if adverse gestational environments resulting from
maternal stress mediate socioeconomic disparities in child language and cognitive development. Aim 2 will
deepen understanding into the placental characteristics of adverse gestational environments that are associated
with lower language and cognitive development. Aim 3 will examine the combined contributions of AGEs and
postnatal caregiving environments in predicting language and cognitive development. Across these aims, we
utilize state-of-the-art methods from the social, behavioral, and biological sciences, and adopt a culturally and
linguistically responsive approach to assessment of child language and cognitive development. This study will
answer key questions about the origins of SES disparities in language and cognitive development that have
important implications for theory, policy, and practice."

 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US. There has been an increasing
recognition of the important contribution of fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) to CVD morbidity and mortality.
Mounting evidence suggests that the use of indoor air filtration to reduce PM2.5 exposure from days to weeks
leads to improvement in acute atherothrombosis biomarkers. However, no trials have assessed whether these
short-term effects are sustained or further improved with prolonged filtration. The proposed study is the longest
intervention trial investigating the effect of using low-cost air purifiers in residences on ameliorating
atherothrombosis progressions in vulnerable individuals. The study will examine atherothrombosis responses to
HEPA filtration across and within four subgroups of male or female and Hispanic or non-Hispanic participants.
We will leverage the diverse population in Los Angeles to investigate the effect of indoor PM2.5 filtration on both
levels and slopes of change in atherothrombosis biomarkers including arterial stiffness, blood pressure, targeted
proinflammatory and prothrombotic markers, and novel proteomic makers, as well as CVD risk score. The focus
on the slopes of change over time is novel and will provide better prediction of future CVD events and mortality
than biomarker level changes assessed in previous studies. We have an experienced team of investigators at
the University of Southern California (USC) and Duke University and will leverage the rich patient resource from
the USC KECK electronic medical records and the linked census-track PM2.5 data to enroll 100 participants of
65-84 years old non-smokers with a history of ischemic heart disease (clinically stable for at least 6 months) who
have lived in the census track with higher ambient PM2.5 exposure in the past years. Participants will be block-
randomized to two intervention arms (HEPA or sham filtrations, each of 9-month duration) and crossed over to
the other intervention arm after a 3-month washout period. This design allows us to conduct the two intervention
arms in the same calendar months of two consecutive years. Three home visits will be conducted during each
intervention arm to set-up and calibrate air monitors, measure health outcomes, and collect biospecimens.
Lifestyle and health covariates will be collected through online questionnaires. The crossover design and timing-
controlled interventions will reduce the influence of confounding factors since participants serve as their own
controls in the within-person comparison. Indoor and outdoor PM2.5 and co-pollutants will be measured; and
meteorological data as well as wildfire events will be recorded throughout the trial. These covariates will be
adjusted for in the statistical analyses. Our aims match the goal of NOT-HL-20-788 calling feasibility trials to
investigate the effects of portable air cleaners on reducing PM2.5 exposure and CVD biomarkers including novel
omics markers. Findings of the proposed study will provide the efficacy and feasibility data to support future
nationwide or multi-center trials to further investigate the air filtration effect on adverse CVD event incidence and
mortality."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and one of the leading causes of death in
the United States. AD is the only leading cause of death for which no disease-modifying therapy is currently
available. Neuroinflammation plays a major role in AD pathogenesis. Epoxyeicosanoid signaling is a key
integrator of cell-cell communication in the central nervous system (CNS), coordinating cellular responses across
different cell types. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are arachidonic acid metabolites of cytochrome P450
epoxygenase that have potent anti-inflammatory activity. In our preliminary study, we demonstrated that
pharmacological inhibition of sEH can attenuate neuroinflammation, enhance reduction of plaque pathology, and
eventually reverse spatial learning and memory deficits in preclinical models of AD. Although some sEH inhibitors
(sEHIs) have been reported, none of them are optimized for CNS applications. Blood brain barrier (BBB) is the
main hurdle for CNS drug development. Taking advantage of high throughput virtual screening and medicinal
chemistry optimization, we developed EHI-16 as a highly potent, orally available and brain permeable sEHI.
Additionally, EHI-16 reduces LPS-induced neuroinflammation in both primary astrocytes and in vivo. In this
project, we will further optimize EHI-16 to develop anti-inflammation therapy for AD treatment. To this end, we
assembled a highly motivated and experienced team with complementary expertise. Dr. Wang is an expert on
small molecule drug discovery and ADMET profiling. Dr. Zheng is a pioneer on AD pathophysiology and mouse
modeling. Our expertise, highly promising preliminary data, and proven collaboration track-record will ensure the
success of the proposed project. In Aim 1, we will develop potent, orally available, and CNS-penetrable sEHIs.
In Aim 2, we will determine the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics relationship of sEHIs and in vivo efficacy
in attenuating neuroinflammation and improving cognitive impairment in AD mouse models. In Aim 3, we will
determine the toxicity and PK profile of sEHIs in rats and dogs and perform IND-enabling studies. The successful
accomplishment of this project will open a new avenue for treating and preventing AD and will advance our
scientific knowledge of multiple mechanisms of AD."
10854951,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born very preterm (VPT, <32 weeks’ gestation) are at increased risk for social
competency impairments compared to their term-born peers, including social communication deficits and poorer
quality peer relationships leading to peer victimization and social rejection. Further, internalizing disorders are 2-
3 times higher in VPT children, with symptoms evident in early childhood and lasting into adulthood. Critically,
how social competence impairments evolve and persist into adolescence, and the extent that known risk factors
associated with VPT birth, including psychosocial adversity and executive dysfunction, shape their trajectory to
increase risk for internalizing disorders remains unknown. Additionally, the cerebellum is a key structure
adversely impacted by VPT birth, and aberrant cerebellar development is now recognized as a major risk factor
for social communication deficits. Altered cerebellar development, along with its functional interactions with the
Frontoparietal and Default Mode Networks involved in socio-emotional function, may be a key mechanism linking
VPT birth, social impairment, and internalizing disorders. We posit that individual-specific patterns of cortico-
cerebellar connectivity and related white matter tract (i.e., cerebellar peduncle) development underlie the
evolution of social competence deficits, and in turn, internalizing disorders that persist or worsen at age 14-15,
a critical period when peer interactions become more sophisticated and central. This process begins during
infancy and extends to adolescence, with psychosocial risk playing a pivotal modifying role. Advances in MRI
methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial
and temporal resolution. We couple innovative MRI techniques with detailed social-interaction and psychiatric
assessments in a unique, longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born adolescents (N=302; 137 VPT and 165 term-
born) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now aged 14-15 years. The cohort has been followed since birth,
undergoing prospective high-quality neonatal and school-age structural and functional connectivity MRI scans
and longitudinal assessments of social competence, socio-emotional functioning, and psychosocial and familial
risk at ages 2, 5, and 9-10 years (>80% retention at all waves). Continued evaluation of this valuable cohort
provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of social competence and internalizing
symptoms for better identification of adolescents at greatest risk for psychopathology and 2) how trajectories of
cortico-cerebellar structural and functional connectivity underlie these deficits. State-of-the-art MRI acquisition
and analyses will characterize the deleterious effects of VPT birth on cortico-cerebellar connectivity into
adolescence. We will delineate links between cortico-cerebellar connectivity, social competence, and
internalizing disorders to elucidate modifiable psychosocial exposures and improve individual-level
neuroimaging, behavior, and psychosocial predictive models that inform the timing of preventative interventions
during sensitive periods of brain and socio-emotional development to mitigate risk for internalizing disorders."

Timely and precisely sensing signals inside the body is critical for survival. Through the vagus nerve, a major
interoceptive system and a key body-brain axis, our brain is able to discriminate numerous physically diversified
inputs from various visceral organs to generate appropriate physiological responses. Anatomical, neurochemical,
and electrophysiological properties of vagal sensory neurons (VSNs) have been extensively investigated over
the past several decades, and their genetic heterogeneity has been beautifully revealed recently. Despite these
efforts in understanding individual vagal body-brain circuits, it is still unclear how this important interoceptive
system is organized to precisely present all body signals. The molecular and functional architecture of the
sensory vagus nerve remain to be a mystery. Are there unique features in VSNs innervating different visceral
organs? How are different body signals coded by the vagus nerve? What are the anatomical and molecular basis
for sensing similar/distinct inputs from different visceral organs? Here, we propose to bring knowledge and
innovative technologies in neuroscience, physiology, genetics, and computational biology to this important
interdisciplinary area to better understand the organization of this critical interoceptive system. Previously, we
have developed a number of novel molecular and genetic techniques in the vagus nerve to enable high-
throughput analysis of neuronal identities based on anatomical structures and neuronal activities. Here we will
employ these powerful tools to determine, through three specific aims, whether the vagus nerve uses specific
genetic signatures to code visceral organs and forms modular anatomical and functional units for sensing diverse
body signals. We expect that studies proposed here will reveal many important details for this essential
interoceptive system. We believe the proposed project will provide not only a critical foundation for delineating
the underlying sensory mechanisms but also genetic access for charting distinct body-to-brain neural circuits
and precise modulation of autonomic functions. A comprehensive and systematic understanding of diverse body-
brain pathways will open up new vistas in this important area of interoception and may bring novel concepts and
therapeutic targets into the field of neuroprotection."

 Low grade systemic inflammation (or inflammaging) associates with many age-associated diseases.
Among the mechanisms that incite inflammaging, damage to the intestinal barrier is likely among the most
important. As a common feature of aging, several studies have indicated a close connection between intestinal
barrier dysfunction, changes in the gut microbiota and chronic inflammation along with systemic multi-organ
injuries. One such organ is the pancreas where barrier impairment is known to contribute to several age-
associated disorders, including impaired insulin secretion and cancer. Despite these connections, why the
intestinal barrier becomes dysfunctional as we age, what drives the changes in microbiome with aging and how
these factors affect the quality of aging are unknown. Answers to these questions will help us identify
mechanisms of healthy aging which is a critical knowledge gain towards increasing quality of life in our aging
population.
 Studies from our group suggest that both the intestinal barrier and microbiome can change in response
to exposure to lifestyle factors (e.g., diet, eating time), that are important modifiable determinant of healthy aging.
In fact, changes in our lifestyle are likely why “aging”-related pathologies are on the rise. Of the several lifestyle
factors that may affect aging, disruption of circadian rhythms that govern a wide spectrum of host physiology is
quite common in our modern society. We and others have shown that disruptions of circadian rhythms negatively
affect intestinal microbiota and barrier function, leading to intestinal and extra-intestinal injuries including in
pancreas. Here we will study the impact of circadian disruptions on the gut-pancreas axis in aging through
microbial signaling. In Aim 1, we will study how food timing (as a proxy for peripheral circadian disruption) affects
intestinal driven inflammation and pancreas aging in mice. We will determine novel microbiome-host rhythms
that are under circadian cues and are connected to the gut-pancreas aging processes. Human studies in Aim 2
will aid in establishing the causal role of microbial signaling in mediating the effect of the host circadian disruption
on the gut-pancreas physiology. Our work will provide critical insights into targetable gut-centric anti-aging
mechanisms that could be considered for future trials as well as for developing prophylactic therapies."
10854982,"Myosin filaments in muscle exhibit an energy-saving “super-relaxed” (SRX) state that is thought to be
fundamental to the energetics and regulation of contraction. In cardiac muscle (including human), the SRX state
contributes to energy economy by sequestering a proportion of myosin heads away from actin, to be released
as needed when cardiac activity increases. Pathologic alterations to the SRX state are thought to underlie many
inherited cardiomyopathies, and therapeutic drugs appear to work by reversing these changes. Despite its
ubiquity and importance, the structural basis of the SRX has not been defined, leaving a crucial gap in our
understanding of cardiac contraction and the mechanism of disease and its treatment. A widely held view is that
SRX is structurally related to another ubiquitous feature of muscle myosin: the “interacting-heads motif” (IHM),
in which myosin’s two heads (blocked and free) interact with each other and with the proximal myosin tail (S2),
inhibiting their activity and conserving ATP. However, recent studies suggest that SRX may be a property of the
myosin heads themselves, and not require head interactions. In this grant we will use single particle electron
microscopy (EM), cryo-EM, and other biophysical techniques to define the structural basis of the SRX state and
the impact of key hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated (DCM) cardiomyopathy-inducing mutations and therapeutic
drugs on the structure of the IHM.
Aim 1 will define the basis of SRX in the isolated cardiac myosin head (S1) and heavy meromyosin
(HMM) by assessing if: (A) the SRX results directly from a specific conformation of the myosin heads, and (B)
the IHM correlates with the SRX state. Myosin constructs comprising single heads (S1) or two heads with 15
heptads of tail (15-hep), enough to form the IHM, will be expressed and characterized by our collaborator, Dr.
Christopher Yengo. Controls will have both heads but only 2 heptads of tail (2-hep), which cannot form a full
IHM. Negative staining EM and class averaging will reveal S1 and IHM conformations, and cryo-EM will show
for the first time the near-atomic resolution structure revealing the interactions within the IHM that underlie cardiac
relaxation. Aim 2 will define the structural basis of the SRX in native thick filaments by determining the near-
atomic cryo-EM structure of filaments isolated from cardiac muscle. Aim 3 will reveal the structural impact of key
HCM- and DCM-inducing mutations and therapeutic drugs on myosin head and IHM structure, using cryo-EM
and single particle imaging.
 The SRX is now widely recognized as a fundamental state of normal relaxed muscle, but its structural
basis is not understood. Our high-resolution structural studies will reveal the near-atomic structures of cardiac
S1 and the IHM and their relationship to the SRX in both molecules and filaments. This will provide new insights
into the fundamental mechanism of relaxation (diastole) in cardiac muscle, and an improved understanding of
the structural basis of cardiomyopathies and their treatment."

The need for more robust evidence to predict risk and prevent suicide among Black male youth is critical in
light of the rapidly rising rates of suicidal behaviors in this population. As the third leading cause of death in
Black male youth aged 12-18, the timely identification of suicide risk is a critical public health priority. Yet, there
is a fundamental gap in suicide research focused on Black male populations in these transitional
developmental stages due to limited investigations of race-related (e.g. discrimination) stress as a unique
antecedent to suicide and its potentially synergistic effect on known risk factors. Digital phenotyping platforms
offers an innovative opportunity to collect real-time data associated with race-related stressors by integrating
active (e.g. ecological momentary assessment-EMA) and passive (e.g. GPS, accelerometer, etc.) data using
smartphones. Refined digital phenotyping platforms may provide more granular insights towards Black male
youth's proximal suicide risk by assessing time-varying factors as they naturally occur. Thus, the proposed
project aligns well with the recent NIMH Notice of Special Interest related to identifying risk and preventing
Black youth suicide (NOT-MH-20-055). Specifically, the candidate plans to address the following specific aims:
(1) Modify a culturally-adapted digital phenotyping protocol for appropriate use among Black male youth; (2)
Conduct a pilot digital phenotyping study among a re-contacted and newly recruited psychiatric sample of
Black male youth to determine feasibility and acceptability of real-time assessments of suicidology in the study
population. The proposed K01 project enhances the candidate's prior research in mental health disparities and
health services research among Black male adolescents, and will uniquely position the candidate to enhance
suicide risk detection methodologies using real-time and culturally-responsive digital strategies. To achieve
these career objectives, the applicant will work with a highly skilled mentorship team (Drs. Holly Wilcox, Roland
Thorpe, Sean Joe, Johannes Thrul, and Hadi Kharrazi) and scientific advisory members (Drs. Leticia Ryan,
David Williams, and Benjamin Lê Cook) to build four areas of expertise relevant to this research agenda: (1)
intensive longitudinal design and analysis, (2) suicide risk identification, (3) engaged and culturally-responsive
recruitment and retention strategies, and (4) translation of research for suitability in youth populations. The K01
award will increase the applicants' capabilities as an independent researcher to develop and test fully-powered
real-time smartphone-based approaches to identify and mitigate suicide risk in this population."
10854847,"Aging is associated with rising arterial stiffness (AS), an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD)
that leads to hypertension, heart attack, stroke, and end organ damage. The development of aging-associated
AS follows a sexually dimorphic pattern of development with women developing AS later in life and women have
higher rates of arterial stiffness-associated CVD such as isolated systolic hypertension and heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction. The molecular mechanisms that contribute to sex differences in the development of
aging-associated AS are unclear. Determination of these mechanisms is an unmet medical need with significant
public health implications. We have shown that aging mice follow a similar pattern of development of AS, with
female mice experiencing a late onset of AS compared to males. Estrogen and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)
are protective in the premenopausal state, yet the role that estrogen/ERα plays in vascular aging has not been
defined. Recent studies have suggested that unliganded ERα (ERα without the presence of estrogen) may be
detrimental to vascular health and due to the declining levels of estrogen in females with age. Further studies
support that ERα/estrogen negatively regulate poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) and that PARP1
transcriptionally represses the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R), a protective arm of the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system. Our preliminary data demonstrate that: 1) aging female mice develop increased AS later in
life than males; 2) vascular ERα expression rises with age in females, 3) estrogen reduces the binding of PARP1
to the AT2R promoter in female SMC; 4) elderly females have enhanced intrinsic vascular smooth muscle cell
stiffness measured by atomic force microscopy compared to elderly males; 5) in a novel mouse model with ERα
deleted from smooth muscle cell (SMC-ERα-KO), AS is prevented in old females and circulating estrogen
declines, supporting a role for unliganded ERα in arterial stiffening and 6) SMC-ERα-KO mice are protected from
the aging-associated increase in aortic PARP1 and decrease in AT2R. We have proposed three specific aims to
test the novel hypothesis that young females are protected from CVD by estrogen--mediated inhibition of PARP1,
resulting in enhanced AT2R activity and that with advancing age, unliganded SMC-ERα contributes to the
development of arterial stiffening via the promotion of PARP1 and consequential inhibition of AT2R expression
and signaling. SA1 will test the hypothesis in vitro that SMC-ERα regulates the PARP-1/AT2R pathway in human
aortic SMC. SA2 will test the in vivo hypothesis that SMC-ERα regulation of PARP-1/AT2R contributes to sex
differences in AS in aging mice by utilizing our novel SMC-ERα-KO mice in addition to determining the role of
SMC-PARP1 in aging-associated AS with our novel SMC-PARP1-KO mice. SA3 will test the therapeutic potential
of chronic AT2R activation and PARP1 inhibition to ameliorate aging-associated AS in male and female mice.
The long-term goal is to identify sex-specific therapeutic targets to aid in improving arterial stiffness and the
associated CVD outcomes in the aging population."
10840998,"ABSTRACT
The cardiac outflow tract (OFT) with adjoining major arteries is susceptible to developmental
insults during embryogenesis that leads to congenital heart disease. Part of the reason for their
vulnerability is because the morphogenesis of the OFT requires the interaction of both neural
crest cells (NCCs) and adjacent second heart field (SHF) mesoderm cells. This takes place
during dynamic expansion of the embryonic pharyngeal apparatus. To understand these two
juxtaposed populations, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) after lineage
purification, focusing mainly on NCCs. Cardiac NCCs (CNCCs) have traditionally been defined
positionally rather than molecularly by specific gene markers of cell fate progression because of
their multipotency and changing genetic profiles. Using scRNA-seq, we were able to identify
putative CNCCs in the pharyngeal apparatus. This was achieved by using expression of early
vascular smooth muscle genes, such as Acta2, as a guide. From this, we identified three
CNCC populations at mouse embryonic day, E10.5. We refer to them as the Tbx2 and Tbx3
(Tbx2/3), Isl1 and Acta2 populations, based upon distinct expression of these genes. We
suggest that the Tbx2/3 and Isl1 lineage cells may independently evolve and contribute to
smooth muscle cells of the pharyngeal arch arteries and OFT, respectively. This proposal is set
to explore the origin and fate trajectories of these three populations by dual lineage tracing, by
determining the function of genes within, and to build gene regulatory networks controlling their
development. Not only will we examine changes in NCCs but also will evaluate surrounding
SHF mesoderm cells because altering CNCCs might affect these progenitor cells as well. We
also have scRNA-seq data on the SHF mesoderm cells purified from mouse embryos. On the
other hand, it is possible that alteration of genes required in the SHF can disrupt CNCC
development. As one specific example, Tbx1, the gene for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is
expressed in the SHF but not CNCCs, but it greatly affects their function. We will test the idea
that in Tbx1 null mutant embryos, CNCCs fail to progress from Sox10 expressing progenitors
and are not able to enter the OFT. Many of the genes to be investigated in this program are
associated with congenital heart disease in human patients. Overall, this program will help
identify molecular aspects of CNCCs and the orchestration of CNCC-SHF cell fates in
embryogenesis."

 The goal of this fellowship application is to support and facilitate the necessary training for the applicant
to develop an independent research career in precision mental health for substance use disorders. Her long-
term program of research will 1) identify and harness data sources that may allow for differential treatment
selection, 2) build machine learning models to select among treatments, 3) bring these models forward for use
in clinical practice, and 4) use these models to inform the development of novel treatments to fill gaps in care.
Through the proposed training goals, guided mentorship, and complementary experiences, this fellowship will
strategically advance the applicant’s career. She will increase her knowledge of substance use disorders and
treatments. She will gain expertise in advanced quantitative methods including feature engineering, genetic
analyses, and machine learning. She will complete her training with the skills to conduct and disseminate
interdisciplinary research poised to further precision mental health research for substance use disorders.
 The proposed project seeks to apply machine learning to precision mental health for cigarette smoking
cessation. Precision mental health is the application of the precision medicine paradigm to mental health
conditions. Precision mental health guides treatment selection using individual differences characteristics likely
to predict treatment success. Several factors have hindered progress towards successful treatment selection
via precision mental health. First, traditional analytic techniques have been insufficient to account for the real-
world complexities that underlie treatment response and recovery. Second, precision mental health models are
built and evaluated in the same sample and consequently do not generalize to new data (i.e., new patients).
Third, precision mental health research has rarely included genetic features (predictors) alongside and in
interaction with clinical (non-genetic) data, preventing integration of knowledge across domains.
 Contemporary machine learning approaches are well-suited to address these limitations. Machine
learning models can accommodate high-dimensional arrays of features across data sources, extract reliable
prediction signals that generalize robustly to new samples of patients, and incorporate genetic and non-genetic
features simultaneously. The proposed project will apply machine learning to the precision mental health
paradigm for cigarette smoking cessation. Cigarette smoking remains a critical and costly public health crisis
for which existing treatments are only moderately effective at best. The proposed project will produce a model
that can guide treatment selection among several first-line (i.e., FDA-approved) smoking cessation
medications. Successful application of the precision mental health paradigm to cigarette smoking cessation
would have immediate clinical impact by accelerating and optimizing therapeutic benefit. It would also serve as
a template for how to improve treatment outcomes across substance use disorders."
10810766,"Maine Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (Maine PRAMS) – Component A
Project Abstract
The Maine Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System aims to accomplish three goals: operationalize and
maintain a population-based surveillance system that collects specific data from Maine postpartum women on
emerging issues regarding maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy;
disseminate data collected to epidemiologists and subject matter experts that will use the data to inform their
practice and overall public health policy; and, ultimately decrease the maternal and infant morbidity and mortality
rate in Maine. These aims coincide with the overall purpose of PRAMS for Component A by aligning efforts to address
surveillance needs especially on a proactive and emerging scale.
To execute this project Maine PRAMS will use multi-modal data collection in the form of both paper and telephone
surveys provided to voluntary participants who are randomly sampled via State of Maine certified birth certificates.
Participants will be randomly sampled based on their delivery date of two to four months prior, residence status (in-
state vs. out-of-state), and non-surrogate and non-adoptive status. This data collection will be conducted on an
ongoing basis by initiating a sample batch for each of the twelve months of a data collection year to capture new
births. The batches will follow a strict schedule that outlines the mailing dates for surveys, when to transition to
phone surveys, and ultimately when to cease data collection for each batch.
Maine PRAMS intends to garner support and data partnerships within the current steering committee as well as
externally to influence the rate of use and the value of the data collected. The nature of these relationships
determines the effect that Maine PRAMS aims to hold on improving the health and wellness of Maine mothers and
babies and simultaneously decreasing the mortality and morbidity of the maternal and child health population."
10840900,"Project Summary
 Telomere, the protein/DNA complex at the chromosome end, is essential for keeping eukaryotic cells
proliferative. Conventional DNA polymerases cannot fully replicate the linear DNA ends, and most eukaryotes
use telomerase to synthesize the telomere G-rich strand de novo. The terminal telomere G-rich 3’ overhang
(G3OH) is essential for telomerase-mediated G-strand synthesis and formation of the T-loop structure that is
critical for protection of the natural chromosome ends from illegitimate DNA processes. In addition, the length of
G3OH needs to be regulated in order to avoid excessive telomeric recombination. Generation of the telomere
G3OH involves resection of the telomere 5’ end by exonucleases after the conventional DNA replication, G-
strand synthesis by telomerase, and C-strand filled-in. In higher eukaryotes, these telomere end processes are
regulated by OB fold-containing telomere ssDNA-binding proteins, which are absent in the kinetoplastid parasite
Trypanosoma brucei. Rather, we have found that T. brucei PolIE, a telomere protein and an A family DNA
polymerase, suppresses telomerase-mediated G-strand extension, helps ensure proper telomere C-strand
synthesis, and suppresses telomeric recombination. T. brucei causes sleeping sickness in humans and regularly
switches its major surface antigen, VSG, to achieve immune evasion. VSGs are monoallelically expressed
exclusively from loci immediately upstream of the telomere. We have shown that telomere proteins not only are
essential for T. brucei cell proliferation but also regulate VSG monoallelic expression and switching. However,
other than the fact that telomerase can synthesize the telomere G-strand DNA, mechanisms of telomere end
processing and its regulation are poorly understood in T. brucei. In this project, we aim to investigate
mechanisms of T. brucei telomere end processing regulation and telomere stability maintenance. In Aim
1, we will investigate how PolIE suppresses the telomerase action and whether it also affects the ending
nucleotides of the two telomere strands. The telomere C-strand fill-in in T. brucei presumably requires a DNA
polymerase. Since PolIE is a DNA polymerase, in Aim 2.1, we will test whether its DNA polymerase domain is
critical for its role in telomere end processing regulation. We have also identified Primase-Polymerase-like
protein 2 (PPL2, with a translesion DNA synthesis activity) as a telomere protein and found that PPL2 depletion
dramatically elongates the telomere G3OH length. In Aim 2.2, we will investigate whether PPL2 is important for
telomere C-strand fill-in and whether this function is PolIE-dependent. T. brucei does not have the non-
homologous end joining (NHEJ) machinery, while dysfunctional telomeres are frequently fused through NHEJ in
higher eukaryotes. In Aim 3, we will investigate whether homologous recombination and Microhomology-
mediated end joining are major pathways for telomeric recombination in WT and PolIE-depleted cells, which will
help reveal illegitimate processes that threaten the natural chromosome ends in T. brucei. Our studies will help
us better understand the telomere protein evolution and contribute to future development of anti-parasite agents."
10840901,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diffusely infiltrative glioma is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Most glioma patients experience
at least one seizure during the course of their disease, and over 30% suffer from repeated seizures, known as
tumor-associated epilepsy (TAE). Current front-line treatment for TAE is levetiracetam (LEV) (a.k.a. Keppra®),
but this fails to control seizures in over 50% of patients. Such patients then require more powerful second-line
antiepileptic drugs that often have greater side effects. TAE is more common in World Health Organization
(WHO) grade II-III gliomas than in grade IV glioblastomas, but the reason for this is not clear. The vast majority
of grade II-III gliomas contain mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (collectively “IDHmut”), which lead
to the production and release of large amounts of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG). D2HG bears a great deal of
structural similarity to glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter that binds to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor
(NMDAR) on neurons. Our data show that D2HG increases in vitro neuronal membrane depolarization and
neuronal network activity, and that this can be completely blocked by an NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist.
We also found that IDHmut glioma increases seizure activity in engrafted mice compared to IDHwt glioma, and
that this is greatly reduced by treatment with IDHmut enzyme inhibitor. Finally, we found that IDHmut gliomas are
much more likely to cause seizures compared to IDHwt gliomas. This is the first direct evidence of a mechanistic
link between IDHmut and seizures; therefore, our hypothesis is that D2HG contributes to an increased
incidence of seizures in patients with IDHmut gliomas, and that new targeted therapeutic strategies can
decrease seizures in these patients. In Aim 1, we will explore the mechanisms by which D2HG triggers
neuronal depolarization and increased neuronal network activity. Our two main hypotheses are: (i) D2HG directly
stimulates NMDA receptors; (ii) D2HG inhibits glutamate reuptake transporters that normally prevent the
pathologic accumulation of glutamate in the synaptic cleft. We will use patch clamping and multi-electrode arrays
to study the effects of D2HG on the electrical activity of cultured mouse cortical neurons, as well as on mouse
brain slices. In Aim 2, we will explore the effects of IDHmut glioma on the surrounding nonneoplastic tissue in
vivo, focusing on changes that are characteristic of epilepsy, including neuronal loss, NMDAR downregulation,
oxidative stress, inflammation, hippocampal damage, and altered mouse behavior. Results will be validated in
patient-derived IDHwt and IDHmut gliomas. In Aim 3, we will compare the anti-seizure effects of two next-
generation IDHmut inhibitors, AG-120 and AG-881, as well as memantine, an NMDAR antagonist that is already
used to treat Alzheimer’s Disease. Each of these drugs will be tested as monotherapy and in combination with
LEV. Successful completion of these Aims will establish the D2HG product of IDHmut as an epileptogenic agent,
will shed more light on how IDHmut alters the nonneoplastic neural tissues surrounding glioma, and will foster
clinical trials to determine the efficacy of IDHmut inhibitors, and memantine, against seizures in these patients."
10840904,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a highly aggressive disease that is projected to become the second
leading cause of cancer deaths in the Western world by 2030. Recently, studies utilizing transcriptional profiling
from resected PDA specimens have identified two molecularly distinct subtypes termed Classical and Basal.
These subtypes correlate with overall patient survival, with the Basal subtype predictive of higher rates of
metastasis, poor response to therapy and the worst outcomes. While this classification represents an important
breakthrough for identifying patients with the most aggressive variant of PDA, the underlying circuits that drive
key features of this variant are unknown. Without a clear understanding of this biology, our ability to effectively
treat patients with the deadliest form of PDA is compromised. Thus, a major goal in the field is to identify drivers
of the Classical and Basal subtypes of PDA in order to 1) effectively target Basal PDA or 2) promote conversion
to a less aggressive variant (Classical) that may respond more effectively to therapy.
 Towards this goal, we have discovered that the Hedgehog pathway transcription factor, GLI2, functions
in a non-canonical ligand independent manner as a critical regulator of the most aggressive Basal subtype of
PDA (Adams et al eLife, 2019; PMC6538376). The key findings in support of this model are, (1) GLI2 expression
is elevated in Basal PDA cell lines and patient tumors and predicts shorter survival in patients, (2) GLI2
suppression leads to loss of Basal identity and inhibits tumor growth while ectopic GLI2 expression in Classical
PDA cells causes a switch to the Basal state (3). Our findings underscore a previously unrecognized level of
plasticity in PDA cells and highlight an entirely new role for GLI2 in driving Basal identity in this disease. Building
on this work, we hypothesize that suppression of GLI2 represents a unique vulnerability in Basal PDA to
combat KRAS* resistance and tumor progression. Thus, we propose 2 specific aims that will 1) define the
non-canonical transcriptional circuits regulated by GLI2 in a cell-autonomous manner to mediate resistance to
KRAS* pathway suppression and 2) determine how GLI2-dependent secreted factors condition surrounding cells
to promote primary and metastatic tumor growth. These studies will determine the cellular circuits that control
Basal identity, define their role in the context of KRAS* resistance, tumor relapse and metastasis and lay the
groundwork for increasing the effectiveness of KRAS-targeted therapies that have entered the clinic."

Though the one-year survival rate in cardiac transplantation has reached 90-95%, the mortality rate beyond the
first year has not changed in the last two decades. Immune-mediated damage remains the primary cause of
long-term graft failure. Findings from our and other studies provide the rationale for investigating the gut
microbiome as a determinant of post-transplantation outcomes and as a potential tool to induce immune
modulation to improve long-term graft outcomes. The goal of this study is to determine the mechanisms by
which the gut microbiome impacts allograft outcome. We postulate that the disrupted metabolic activities of the
gut microbiome lead to inflammatory responses and intestinal injury via cell-type specific responses in the
intestinal cells network, which subsequently modulate alloimmunity and ultimately chronic cardiac graft
outcomes. We will take advantage of our clinically-relevant cardiac transplant murine model of chronic rejection
with well-characterized alloresponses, induced by pro- or anti-inflammatory bacteria, to determine the
alterations in the microbial metabolic activities in Aim 1, then to identify local intestinal barrier changes and the
underlying intestinal cell-type specific responses in Aim 2, and finally to characterize systemic alloresponses
and graft survival in Aim 3, in order to obtain a holistic understanding of the precise mechanisms of
microbiome-driven chronic graft outcomes. The proposed work will identify novel and critical microbiome-based
targets for diagnostic application and therapeutic intervention, and discern the complex and bidirectional
dialogue between the microbiome and alloimmunity to promote transplant immunologic quiescence and long-
term cardiac graft survival."
10841002,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ag-specific CD8 T cells express T cell receptors (TCRs) that recognize antigens in the form of processed
peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) molecules. In healthy individuals, the CD8
TCR repertoire comprises approximately 106–108 different cell populations. Soluble pMHCI multimers are widely
used to enumerate and isolate Ag-specific T cells by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS); however, FACS
has limitations including low-throughput, high shear-stress damage (especially to rare cells), and low multiplexing
depth due to limited number of fluorophores. For high-throughput cell sorting (>106 cells) such as for
manufacturing T cell therapies, magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) is commonly used but can only produce
antibody-enriched or depleted cell fractions, and cells sorted by positive selection remain labeled with beads,
preventing immediate downstream assays such as phenotyping by flow analysis. New approaches are needed
for multiplexed, high-throughput and label-free isolation of Ag-specific T cells. This proposal will develop DNA-
gated sorting (DGS) cytometry for multiplexed isolation of Ag-specific CD8 T cells. DGS comprise a molecular
DNA circuit that couples a magnetic bead to pMHCI molecules through DNA hybridization, and that functions as
a sorting ‘gate’ to capture, release, and recover Ag-specific T cells by toehold-mediated strand displacement. By
using orthogonal DNA strand displacement reactions, a library of beads coated with different pMHCI antigens
can simultaneously capture target cell populations en masse and each subpopulation can then be eluted by
sequential strand displacement. In contrast to fluorophores, the number of possible DNA sequences to design
strand displacement reactions scales exponentially by the length n of the DNA oligo (i.e., 4n), providing the
possibility to extend this technology to isolate Ag-specific T cells at depths that is currently not possible. This
proposal will also implement DGS with pMHCI monomers that multimerize when hybridized onto the bead to
produce the required binding avidity for T cell capture, but after cell release, revert into monomers to dissociate
from T cells resulting in label-free isolates. It will also implement light-induced peptide exchange to produce large
pMHCI libraries to integrate with multiplexed DGS. Finally, this proposal will demonstrate an important
application for the manufacturing of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells using virus-specific T cells to redirect
them to tumor cells, using key benchmarks such as ex vivo functional assays (expansion, transduction efficiency,
cytotoxicity) and in vivo therapy in mice bearing CD19+ cancer cells."

Veterinary biomedical researchers greatly enhance animal-based research that serves as the key bridge
connecting basic science and human-based studies. Veterinarian scientists play crucial roles by performing
biomedical research and by developing, characterizing, and using animal models to study human diseases,
enhancing rigor and reproducibility. Building on the outstanding foundation in comparative pathophysiology and

the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The primary goal of our program is to launch the careers of
veterinarian-scientists. We request funding for six DVM/VMD trainee slots/year to provide 3 years of
support/trainee. At Johns Hopkins, veterinarian trainees pursue research-intensive training by completing
PhDs or research postdoctoral fellowships if they enter the program holding dual degrees (both DVM/VMD and
PhD). We have a deep applicant pool to draw from to fill these positions. Our training program offers an
outstanding career development opportunity for veterinarians passionate about building careers in biomedical
research and becoming innovators and leaders in their fields. The great majority of trainees pursue either

Hartford Foundation, which supports dementia and palliative care programs; the Eisner Foundation, which supports intergenerational programs; and other innovative collaborations between academic and community nonprofit organizations. To meet the objectives outlined above, we will rely on methods we have been using successfully over the past 25 years to identify research mentors, match medical students with these mentors, monitor students’ research progress, facilitate this progress when needed, teach essential general research skills (including the responsible conduct of research), and provide a forum for presentation of students’ research and discussion of ideas. In addition, we will offer small group discussion of common topics in clinical geriatrics, career options in aging, and the opportunity to observe and to participate in the clinical care of geriatric patients in a variety of settings. By accomplishing the aims outlined in this application, this program will encourage and support medical students' interest in aging research and geriatrics, and develop a new cadre of physician scientists who will be able to address key issues related to the research priorities of the NIA.

10845134,"OVERALL: Targeting Cellular Senescence to Extend Healthspan – SUMMARY
 This proposal is for the renewal of P01 AG62413, Targeting Cellular Senescence to Extend Healthspan. In
the initial funding cycle, we made major conceptual and technical advances in the understanding of cellular
senescence, its mechanistic role in the aging of three distinct tissues, and its modifiability by pharmacological
intervention. The influence and impact of this highly collaborative PPG are highlighted by over 130 publications,
complementary grants, career development awards, and significant engagement in the Common Fund Cellular
Senescence Network. Moreover, several clinical trials have been initiated, consistent with the overall goal to
build a firm foundation of multidisciplinary discovery science in cellular senescence that leads to a pipeline of
therapeutic strategies that slow or prevent age-associated diseases.to drive translational geroscience forward.
 Our progress has also yielded several exciting and critical questions centered on the molecular
underpinnings of the senescence program, including the unique and overlapping roles of p16Ink4a and p21Cip1,
the role of specific senescent cell sub-types in tissue and systemic aging, and the tractability of these cell
populations by next-generation small molecules engineered to promote their elimination (senolytics) or alter their
behavior (senomorphics). We have assembled a uniquely qualified, highly collaborative, and multidisciplinary
team to pursue these new and important scientific directions in the renewal through three tissue-centered
projects and four highly complementary cores. The projects are Cellular Senescence and Bone Aging (Project
1), Cellular Senescence and Skeletal Muscle Aging (Project 2), and Cellular Senescence and Brain Aging
(Project 3). The multidisciplinary cores consist of an Administrative and Systems Biology Core (Core A), a
Common Mouse Models Core (Core B), a Drug Discovery and Development Core (Core C), and a Senescence
Molecular Phenotyping Core (Core D), each armed with innovative technologies and the appropriate expertise.
Collectively, through the coordination, integration, and analysis of research activities and results across the three
projects and four cores detailed in this application, this PPG will yield fundamental insights into the governing
roles of p16Ink4a and p21Cip1 in cellular senescence and aging, critical data on the therapeutic potential of
senotherapeutic compounds for age-related tissue dysfunction, and an advanced understanding and new
hypotheses regarding cellular senescence as a mediator of inter-organ communication between bone, skeletal

10842512,"ABSTRACT
Single cell approaches to measure gene expression genome-wide across all cells of developing organisms are
beginning to revolutionize our study of development, but we are still learning how to maximize the use of single
cell “atlases” and related methods to learn new developmental mechanisms. The C. elegans embryo is an
ideal system for single cell approaches because of its invariant development and powerful experimental tools.,
and the conservation of major regulatory mechanisms with humans. We have developed large-scale
expression resources to learn the “parts list” of embryonic fate specification. These include a single-cell RNA-
seq atlas of gene expression across most embryonic cells as well as protein expression profiles of hundreds of
transcription factors in the “Expression Patterns in Caenorhabditis” (EPIC) database that contains the
expression of over 250 fluorescent reporters analyzed by automated lineage tracing and expression mapping
methods. This proposal aims to understand the zygotic regulation of lineage specification during the period
from ~gastrulation through terminal differentiation. This critical developmental period was previously hard to
study due to redundancy and complex phenotypes, but our pioneering work combining single cell approaches
with mechanistic reverse genetics is helping to overcome these hurdles. Our recent and proposed work aims
1) to improve the utility, interpretability and quality of single cell embryonic atlases, 2) to leverage whole-
organism approaches to understand developmental regulatory networks, especially the context-specific ability
of the Wnt pathway to regulate lineage-specific targets, and 3) to understand how dynamic processes like high-
rate transcription and RNA turnover control the robust, timely, regulation of developmental decisions. This work
will both extend our understanding of developmental mechanisms, and provide lessons for similar studies in
more complex animals."

General anesthetics are routinely administered during surgical procedures to induce a reversible state of
unconsciousness, amnesia, analgesia, and immobility. However, it has become evident that anesthetics can
have detrimental effects on neurophysiological processes, including alterations in attention, sleep, and memory,
particularly in vulnerable populations such as neonates and older adults. Despite this knowledge, the precise
mechanisms underlying these undesired effects of anesthetics remain elusive. Our research aims to delve into
these mechanisms at the neural circuit, cellular, and molecular levels. Recent findings from our laboratory have
revealed the emergence of hyperactive neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) following anesthesia as an early
functional indicator of subsequent neurocognitive changes. Building upon these findings, we will further
determine the involvement of local inhibitory circuits and deeper brain centers, such as the hippocampus, which
send long-range projections to the PFC. Using a combination of in vivo calcium imaging, virus-based circuit
tracing, and chemogenetics, we will elucidate the functional relevance of these circuits to the detrimental effects
induced by anesthetics and develop strategies to protect cognitive function after anesthesia. In addition, our
preliminary data suggest that astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells expressing GABAA receptors, respond to
GABAergic anesthetics and subsequently activate the unfolded protein response. We will test the hypothesis
that sustained activation of the unfolded protein response in astrocytes leads to reduced release of soluble
factors crucial for synaptogenesis, resulting in synapse loss and long-term memory decline. Additionally, we will
investigate whether restoring astrocytic function through a novel gene delivery strategy capable of permeating
the blood-brain barrier would alleviate neurocognitive deficits induced by anesthesia. Collectively, the proposed
research will contribute to a mechanistic understanding of the detrimental effects of anesthetics on the brain.
This knowledge is critical for optimizing anesthesia practices and mitigating potential adverse effects. By
unraveling the intricate interplay between anesthetics, neuro-immune-glial interactions, and brain plasticity, our
research holds promise for advancing perioperative care and promoting brain health."

To survive in dynamic environments, the nervous system must be able to generate flexible behavior —
seamlessly weaving together past experience with the present context to achieve future goals. Our team
of experts on the neural circuits of behavior will collaborate to reveal the neural mechanisms by which a
mouse engages in specific processing of one sensory modality versus another based on task demands. We
hypothesize that these types of context-dependent behaviors operate through a flexible coupling and
decoupling of neural networks mediated by changes in neural dynamics based on gain modulation,
similar to mechanisms that are engaged in brain state regulation. During the waking state, arousal,
attention, and task engagement constantly vary and are associated with ongoing and large changes in the
activity of neuromodulatory (e.g., norepinephrine and acetylcholine) systems as well as intracortical
feedback pathways whose role is to specifically modulate neural network interactions. Through
identifiable and precise mechanisms, these pathways control the patterns of activity generated by the
neocortex, flexibly increasing or decreasing the information flow between specific neuronal networks. By
defining these precise mechanisms through a series of cutting-edge experiments, analysis and modelling,
we will shed light onto how the nervous system generates context-dependent behavior. By understanding
how the cortex flexibly reconfigures its functional interactions to produce contextually-appropriate
behavior, and how arousal and engagement modulate this flexibility, we will provide insight into a broad
range of human disorders, from those of attention and perception, to social interactions."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global concern that precipitates a diverse set of health consequences. TBI is a
major concern in forensic populations -- an issue recently highlighted by calls for research by national public
health institutions [1]. Indeed, upwards of 60% of inmates have a history of TBI, a rate seven times higher than
the general population (8.5%) [2, 3]. TBI is a criminogenic risk factor [3, 4] and even mild TBI increases the rates
of risk-taking behavior, substance use, and future offending [2, 4]. Over the last decade our team has been
continuously funded by NIH to collect detailed clinical and neuroimaging protocols from over 4000 incarcerated
men and women. We utilize a unique pair of twin mobile MRI units that are deployed directly on the secure
grounds of forensic facilities, making it possible to conduct this research. Our dataset includes multimodal
neuroimaging protocols, thorough clinical assessment, neuropsychological evaluations, and histories of TBI. All
of our n>4000 offenders have consented to participate in longitudinal follow-up studies. For this project, we will
commence a longitudinal study on n=300 individuals aged 35+, examining variables that will differentiate
trajectories associated with cognitive impairments. We will also leverage advanced neuroimaging tools
developed by our team to provide brain-based measures of cognitive decline and imaging-based classification
tools for identifying brain injuries and comorbid conditions (i.e., substance abuse, psychopathy scores,
depression, etc.). We will also examine how the brain injury profiles and comorbid conditions change over time.
The availability of these unique resources to examine this highly underserved population makes this an exciting
project with the potential to break new ground in our understanding of individual risk needs and divergent
outcomes in TBI and neurodegenerative disease."

This application aims to develop, implement, and evaluate an innovative research training program designed to
offer training and support to undergraduate students at Duke University and the University of North Carolina
(UNC) – Chapel Hill from diverse backgrounds to pursue careers in aging research. The long-term goal is to
enhance the diversification of the aging research workforce and promote scientific excellence. Diversity of
thoughts and approaches fosters innovation and creativity, and it is essential for scientific excellence. Yet, it is
well-established that much of the U.S. population scientific talent remains untapped, particularly among persons
from systematically disadvantaged social backgrounds. For example, while Hispanics/Latinos comprise nearly
20% and Blacks/African Americans 13% of the U.S. population, they represent less than 5% and 2% of R01-
awardees, respectively. The proposed Duke/University of North Carolina Advancing Diversity in Aging Research
(Duke/UNC ADAR) program will build on the infrastructure and expertise available at the Duke Center for the
Study of Aging and Human Development (Duke Aging Center) and UNC-Chapel Hill, to develop a collaborative,
state-of-the-art research training program at the forefront of providing training in aging research and resilience
to undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. This will be accomplished by providing diverse students
at these institutions with 1) mentored “hands-on” paid research experiences, 2) weekly seminars aimed at
enhancing skills and knowledge in aging and resilience research, as well as fostering career development, and
3) facilitated engagement activities with peers, older adults and the scientific community, aimed at promoting
group cohesion, enhance interest in pursuing careers in aging research, and promote a sense of belonging in
science, which will be key to fostering professional resilience. Mentors will include faculty from the Duke Aging
Center and UNC-Chapel Hill with expertise in aging and resilience research. Up to six new students will be
selected every year to participate in this 2-year program. They will be paired with a primary mentor at Duke
University or UNC, and will have access to a larger, diverse network of co-mentors. Together, the student and
primary mentors will develop an Individual Development Plan. There will be rigorous evaluation of the students’
career progress and of the mentoring relationship. Other features of the program will include active involvement
of community leaders, group projects, and mentoring training. Short-term outcome measures will include number
and diversity of students, research presentations, submission of abstracts and feelings of belonging in science.
Mid-term outcomes will include admission to and completion of graduate school. Long-term outcome measures
will include pursuit of careers in research and aging, grant funding and attaining independent scientist status. By
combining the unique strengths of Duke and UNC-Chapel Hill, this program will sow the seeds for the
development of a cadre of diverse scientists with expertise in aging research and promote a strong community
of researchers who are equipped to optimize reserve and resilience among older adults."

The multidisciplinary T32 postdoctoral training program in Cardiovascular Imaging at Stanford (CVIS) is designed
to train the next generation of cardiovascular imaging investigators by exposing them to three complementary
areas – clinical, engineering, and molecular imaging. With the rise in the impact of cardiovascular disease on
U.S. and world health and the rapid advances in imaging technologies and cardiovascular biology, it is critical
that trainees be provided a broad, multidisciplinary and collaborative training program to foster their ability to
translate cardiovascular imaging research into clinical applications. The program goals include rigorous training
in the scientific method, critical analysis, logical reasoning, and independent thinking in a highly collaborative
setting. Trainees develop a focused area of cardiovascular imaging research expertise and exposure to a wide
range of complementary research techniques. Mentors model collegial and productive collaboration, provide
guidance in oral and written communication, and model responsible, rigorous, and reproducible research
practices. The program proposes to continue training four postdoctoral fellows in multidisciplinary cardiovascular
imaging research. Fellows are appointed to the CVIS T32 annually, with a strong encouragement to seek their
own funding for additional years as part of the skills imparted by the program. Thirty trainees so far have benefited
from this program, including 12 women and 4 underrepresented minorities. Four fellows are currently in training.
Continuous and consistent evaluation from the trainees report a high degree of satisfaction with the program.
Fourteen of the past trainees have gone on to become independent researchers in premier academic institutions
and in industry. The Program is directed by Joseph Wu, MD, PhD (Contact PI), Professor of Radiology and
Cardiovascular Medicine and Director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute (CVI); John Pauly, PhD, Professor
of Electrical Engineering; and Koen Nieman, MD, PhD, Professor of Radiology and Medicine (Cardiology) at
Stanford University. Administrative and program management support is provided by a dedicated team of
educators in the Stanford CVI. An Internal Advisory Board consisting of senior Stanford faculty from a broad
range of disciplines and an External Advisory Board consisting of leading experts in cardiovascular imaging
research in the U.S. play a vital role in monitoring the progress of this training program, providing ongoing support
and advice as needed. The overarching goal of the program is to train the next generation of investigators with
expertise in advanced cardiovascular imaging technology, dedicated to identifying innovative solutions, and
capable of translating basic research into clinical success."

The overall goal of this K01 application is to estimate the impact of 1915(c) Home and Community-Based
Services (HCBS) Medicaid waiver programs for children with Severe Emotional Disturbance (SED) on
behavioral health care service use and expenditures for children with SED. Children with severe SED are at
significant risk for psychiatric long-term care (LTC) use due to the severity of their symptoms and inability to
access alternative community-based behavioral health care. To reduce public financial burdens and family
distress associated with use of psychiatric LTC, one in five states offer 1915(c) HCBS Medicaid waiver
policies. These policies expand the Medicaid-funded community-based service array for children who exhibit a
clinical need for institutional psychiatric care, regardless of family income levels. Though these policies are
intended to prevent psychiatric LTC use by providing alternative community-supports, achievement of these
goals is unclear. Scant existing research lacks either causal inference or generalizability, as they are cross
sectional, regional, or minimally control for clinical variation in program participants. The goal of this K01 is to
train the recipient in the statistical and methodological skills needed to study the impacts of health policy on
service utilization and expenditure outcomes for children and youth with complex behavioral health needs.
Research aims are to 1) create a comprehensive SED waiver policy dataset that codifies the structures and
provisions of these policies across states and over time, 2) identify and compare characteristics of children
enrolled in SED waiver programs and children who use psychiatric LTC among Medicaid-enrolled children with
behavioral health disorders; 2b) assess SED waiver policies and waiver program enrollment’s association with
amelioration of adverse risk factors for LTC, and 3) estimate the effects of the Texas SED Waiver and its
characteristics on Medicaid-reimbursed behavioral health service use and expenditures. The training aims of
the project are to 1) acquire knowledge, skill, and experience in public health law research methods, 2) build
knowledge on the assumptions and applicability of research designs and statistical methods for estimating
causal effects of behavioral health policy interventions using observational and administrative data, 3) apply
current and best practices for defining and measuring behavioral health service use and expenditures using
diverse sources of health claims data and 4) obtain the research, writing, and administrative expertise to
submit a successful R01 grant during the final year of the K01. Training aims will be accomplished through
formal coursework, individualized instruction, seminar and workgroup participation, mentored research, and
conference participation. Research aims will use data from state SED waiver applications merged with
Medicaid claims data from state and federal resources. This project will provide novel evidence for
policymakers nationwide regarding which children may be at risk for psychiatric institutional care, the policy or
service interventions that may reduce these risks, and what costs may be associated with these interventions."

Targeted protein degradation with small molecule degraders is an emerging therapeutic modality for cancer
treatment. Degraders have several advantages compared with traditional inhibitor drugs that make them
attractive new therapeutic entities. First, degraders can work at much lower concentration than inhibitors, thus
can be used at lower dosage and have lower drug toxicity. Second, degraders remove the target protein
altogether rather than simply inhibiting the enzymatic activity of the protein, thus eliminating the non-enzymatic
activities of target proteins. Such non-enzymatic activities are especially common for histone deacetylases
(HDACs). Third, degraders can be used to target targets considered “undruggable” by conventional means,
which represent 80% of the human proteome, as long as a protein binding ligand is available. However, the
current strategies to develop degraders follow a rather empirical route with fortuitous outcomes. Here we propose
to develop a new screening platform to discover and develop degrader molecules. The strategy involves
structure guided degrader library design based on promiscuous inhibitors that target a protein family followed by
chemo-proteomics screening to identify degradable protein family members and selective degraders against
them. The large amount of data from proteomics screens enables us to understand the relationship between the
chemical structures of degraders and potency of target protein degradation, which feeds back to the next round
of iterative library design and screening. Such iterative rounds of optimization with proteomics evaluation have
proven to be a more effective way to generate selective and potent degraders for developing therapeutic
candidates and chemical probes for biological studies. We apply this strategy to an important family of enzymes,
HDACs, for which specific inhibitors are rarely available. HDACs are therapeutic targets for many different kinds
of cancer and human diseases. We propose to develop selective degraders for a number of HDAC members.
Particularly, we hope to develop HDAC8 degraders as a new therapeutic candidate for Ewing sarcoma, an
aggressive cancer in children and young adults that have an urgent need for new therapeutic options. Secondly,
we hope to develop selective HDAC6 degraders to test the proposed role of HDAC6 in inflammasome activation.
We believe this strategy is widely applicable to other protein families and would make a significant impact in the
field of developing degrader therapeutics."
10832626,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Metabolic and innate immune responses, two primitive systems critical for the long-term homeostasis of multi-
cellular organisms, have evolved to promote cooperative, adaptive responses against diverse environmental
challenges. Unfortunately, over-nutrition and dietary imbalances are associated with pathogen-independent
(sterile) innate immune signaling pathway activation, leading to mis-regulation of these systems and instigating
metabolic dysfunction and disorders (such as obesity and diabetes). NF-kB transcription factors, evolutionarily
conserved regulators of innate immunity, are emerging as a critical node in this bidirectional coordination of
metabolic and innate immune responses across taxa. Uncovering the ancestral integration of metabolic systems
and NF-kB function, shaped by diet and nutrition, thus advances understanding of both basic physiology and the
complex etiology associated with metabolic diseases. The overarching goal of this proposal is to elucidate a
framework of NF-kB-centric innate immune-metabolic signaling networks using tractable invertebrate models
coupled with cell-based mammalian models. Drosophila provide a powerful integrative physiology model
(tractable both in terms of in vivo genetics and diets) to build this framework; as these signaling networks are
conserved from insects to mammals. Mainly utilizing Drosophila, new insights derived from previous studies
have revealed an evolutionarily conserved role for the innate immune transcription factor NF-kB in modulating
metabolic target gene expression during adaptation to dietary changes. It was uncovered that NF-kB antagonism
of Foxo function (a key nutrient-responsive transcription factor) is crucial to influence metabolic target genes in
diverse cell types to shape distinctive aspects of lipid metabolism (largely linked to catabolism – usage,
breakdown, and mobilization). This antagonism subsequently balances energy homeostasis with diet-dependent
nutrient supply and promotes metabolic adaptation. These findings highlight a critical need to explore the distinct
molecular and cellular mechanisms, governed by ancient innate immune signaling pathways, that may shape
the equilibrium between normal physiology and pathology associated with diet-mediated disruptions in lipid
metabolism. To this end, it is possible that diet- and NF-kB-dependent antagonism of metabolic transcription
factor function may be central to the integration of innate immune-metabolic signaling networks. There are three
specific aims to this proposal: (i) to explore interactions between NF-kB and histone deacetylases in the control
of diet-dependent chromatin remodeling and lipid metabolism, (ii) to determine whether unique signaling
mechanisms direct diet- and NF-kB-dependent transcriptional attenuation (vs activation) of metabolic target
genes, and (ii) to characterize NF-kB-modulated gene regulatory networks shaped by dietary imbalances and
chromatin remodeling. Exploiting Drosophila to explore the origin of innate immune-metabolic interactions holds
promise for an enhanced rate of uncovering novel mechanisms that underly lipid-metabolic imbalances and
metabolic dysfunction."
10833125,"Project Summary: Background: India has 267 million users of smoked and smokeless tobacco, making
cessation efforts critical for addressing tobacco-related cancers and diseases. An important opportunity comes
from brief advice interventions to promote tobacco cessation. These interventions can be delivered in a few
minutes by practitioners and typically include screening for tobacco use, brief counseling, and referral to
services. However, these programs do not meet the needs of the Indian context at this time as they: a) typically
come from high-resource, Western settings, b) emphasize the use of pharmacotherapy, and c) require highly
credentialed staff. We focus here on task-shifting, or using less credentialed workers who are more readily
available than highly credentialed professionals. We will support them through training and technology-based
ongoing supports (using an “app” and a social media channel).
Goal: We will adapt and evaluate the impact of a brief advice intervention for tobacco cessation to be delivered
in dental clinics, tuberculosis clinics, and non-governmental primary health centers. This proposal leverages
investigators' expertise with implementation science and behavioral interventions focused on cancer
prevention and control; the Mumbai-based team's expertise in training practitioners to use brief advice
programs; and the technology partner's expertise in developing apps to support health workers implement
programs.
Methods: This hybrid effectiveness-implementation study will test the impact of an adapted brief advice
intervention on tobacco cessation outcomes and will also collect pilot data regarding implementation factors.
Accordingly, the study draws on a tobacco cessation framework (5 A's) and an implementation science
framework (the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment framework). The study is organized
around three aims. Aim 1 will include formative research to support adaptation of existing brief advice
interventions. Aim 2 supports a randomized controlled trial to assess effectiveness of the adapted intervention
and gather pilot implementation data. Aim 3 addresses the opportunity to engage trained practitioners in an
ongoing manner through technology-based supports, with an emphasis on linking such engagement to
program delivery.
Innovations and impact: This study is innovative in that it focuses on scaleability at every step – from task
shifting to selecting practitioners outside the primary healthcare system, to using technology to support
practitioners. These features allow for a simple, scaleable brief advice intervention that can be used widely in
low-resource settings in Mumbai as well as other low- and middle-income countries, which is key for impact.
Findings from the study will support scalable tobacco cessation in India and will build the literature on adapting
research evidence from high-income countries to lower- and middle-income countries."
10833051,"Summary
Membrane organization in eukaryotic cells is controlled by ADP ribosylation factors (Arfs), small
GTPases that function as molecular switches to activate signaling cascades. Arfs regulate vesicular
transport of lipids and proteins between the ER and the Golgi (Class I-Arf1) and endosome-plasma
membrane trafficking (Class III-Arf6), implicating Arf function in cytokinesis, cell shape, organelle
transport, mitochondrial and lipid droplet function and pH-dependent regulation of cell size. Mutations
in Arfs or their partners have been linked to genetic neurological diseases causing severe malformation
of the cerebral cortex or mental retardation. Moreover, many pathogenic bacteria and viruses
commandeer Arfs as they invade cells, thereby promoting infection. Our overall goal is to understand
the nucleotide exchange transitions of Arf GTPases, the mechanisms of which cannot be deduced from
their static structures. We hypothesize that the Arf conformations specifically recognized by their
cognate exchange factors correspond to significantly disrupted excited states that are populated at very
low levels under standard conditions. Specifically, we aim to map the GDP/GTP switches of Arf1 and
Arf6 (Aims 1 and 2), and using mutational analysis, establish the underlying molecular mechanisms of
their functional specificity (Aim 3). Our approach combines experimental biophysical tools (multi-
dimensional NMR, SAXS and fluorescence) with pressure perturbation and coarse-grained molecular
dynamics simulations constrained by our data, to provide structural ensembles and pseudo-free energy
landscapes that will reveal functionally relevant excited states implicated in Arf function and specificity.
These excited state structures will provide novel target sites for inhibiting Arf signaling pathways,
offering new avenues for developing approaches to mitigate the invasive capacity of bacteria and
viruses. More generally, the pressure-based mapping approach proposed here represents a powerful
means to characterize elusive states of proteins implicated in their functions."
10833055,"Hypothesis: A minimal glycan shield with specific sugar composition on the envelope glycoprotein (Env) of HIV-
1 may be necessary for establishing new infections. In the HIV “selected” for a new infection, glycan
content/composition on Env could differ based on the mode and receptacle of transmission (e.g. rectal, penile,
foreskin, vaginal, and cervical tissue in sexual transmission) as well as the cytokine/chemokine milieu and
microbiome. Understanding glycan composition on the transmitted HIV-1 in these microenvironments would
improve the design and effectiveness of humoral-based HIV-1 vaccine.
For the past 15 years, this R01 has compared HIV disease parameters to replicative HIV fitness in T cells,
macrophages, dendritic cell cocultures, and various ex vivo, non-mucosal tissues. We have shown that
competitive replicative fitness of patient-derived HIV is a surrogate of pathogenesis and in the absence of
treatment, was a strong correlate of disease progression. However, our published work indicates that
“pathogenic” and “transmission” fitness of primary HIV-1 isolates are quite distinct. Using varying conditions with
human explant penile and endocervical (EnC) tissues exposed to over 20 different mixtures of HIV-1 derived
from acute and chronic disease, we now have a clearer picture of factors impacting HIV transmission. We
observed “trapped” replication of chronic HIV-1 in mucosal (penile and cervical) tissue while the acute HIV-1
isolates were carried through the tissue (possibly via DCs) to infect Th17 or Th1 CD4+ T cells. HIV-1 that
“escapes” mucosal tissues typically have lower affinity for C type lectins and fewer N linked glycosylation sites.
To enhance these studies we worked closely with programmers and bioinformatic specialists to develop robust
NGS analysis pipelines to determine transmission fitness from multivirus competitions and more recently, we
optimized EIS-MS techniques to analyze gp120 glycans.
We have proposed four highly inter-related aims to test our hypotheses:
Specific Aim 1. In vivo analyses of HIV-1 in endocervical (EnC) and plasma samples and determinants of
new HIV transmissions. Examine Env sequence features in the EnC and blood of newly infected women as
well as in women with HIV-1 infection in the EnC but who have not seroconverted.
Specific Aim 2. Characterizing the properties of transmitted/founder (TF) HIV variant in blood versus the
transmitted HIV-1 population in the female and male genital tract: Ex vivo study. Measure trapped
replication in the tissue versus transmission in human penile, foreskin, cervical, and vaginal explant model.
Specific Aim 3. To measure lectin binding affinity and to analyze the glycosylation pattern on the gp120
Env of highly transmissible TF HIV-1 using new gp120 purification techniques and EIS-MS.
Specific Aim 4. To modify the glycans on TF and EnC viruses and to determine optimal HIV Env for
male to female HIV transmissions using the same methods described in aims 2 and 3."

Airway submucosal glands (SMGs) are known to contain reserve stem cells for the surface airway epithelium
(SAE). In mice, this niche serves only the trachea; however, in larger mammals such as humans, pigs and ferrets,
SMGs are present throughout the intralobar cartilaginous airways and may serve the broader function of
maintaining the proximal conducting airway epithelium in the setting of disease. During the previous six funding
cycles, this grant has used mouse and ferret genetic models to address multiple aspects of airway SMG biology,
SMG stem/progenitor cell biology, and cystic fibrosis (CF) lung pathogenesis. This proposal aims to identify the
subpopulations of glandular myoepithelial cells (GMECs) that participate in airway repair, as well as the Wnt-
regulated mechanisms that control their behavior following injury. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize
that Lef-1 and Sox9 transcription factors differentially control Wnt-responsive GMEC states that orchestrate the
commitment, renewal, migration, and proliferative expansion of GMECs on the airway surface. Aim 1 will define
the biology of tracheal GMECs in mice and utilize an array of transgenic lines (intersectional lineage tracing,
conditional knockout, Wnt-reporters, Dox-inducible H2B-GFP) to study the involvement of Lef-1 and Sox9 in
regulating processes that control GMEC commitment, renewal, migration, and proliferation. Aim 2 will use
intersectional lineage tracing in ferrets to define the participation of GMEC subtypes and gland ductal cells in
maintaining the extralobar and intralobar SAE at homeostasis and following injury. We hypothesize that gland
ducts are a site for GMEC maturation to a pre-basal cell state, and that this underlying hierarchical relationship
is disturbed in chronic airway diseases such as CF. Aim 3 will test this hypothesis by identifying disturbances in
GMEC and gland duct niches in the setting of mild and severe CF lung disease, using VX-770-responsive
CFTRG551D ferrets. Novel aspects of these studies include the first non-rodent fate mapping in a species (ferret)
that closely models CF lung disease and SMG biology of humans, and supporting fate mapping data
demonstrating that ferret GMECs (ACTA2CreER) and gland ductal cells (KRT7CreER) participate in SAE repair. This
research will also shed light on differences in the behavior of SMG stem cell compartments in the extralobar and
intralobar cartilaginous airways, which cannot be addressed in mice because they lack SMGs in the intralobar
airways. This project is designed to enhance our understanding of stem cell phenotypes in airway SMGs and
the mechanisms that regulate their participation in SMG and surface airway repair. Given that GMECs can
regenerate both glandular and surface airway cell types, they are an attractive target for gene editing in CF and
such efforts will be enhanced by knowledge gained from this proposal. Furthermore, this work will delineate
disease-associated changes to SMG stem cell niches that may be important for the pathogenesis of CF airway
disease and other hypersecretory diseases that affect SMGs, such as asthma and chronic bronchitis."
10833191,"The Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi causes an infection with diverse clinical outcomes, which can
include arthritis as well as cardiac and neurological involvement. Lyme neuroborreliosis can range from
headaches and mild meningitis to more serious manifestations including vasculitis. Despite antibiotic treatment,
a proportion of patients continue to suffer from debilitating symptoms including neurological effects. The
mechanisms of central nervous system (CNS) pathology as well as bacterial and host risk factors for these
manifestations are poorly understood, largely due to the lack of a tractable laboratory model for the study of
Lyme disease in the CNS.
Previously, we reported the ability of Bb to colonize the dura mater of mice during late disseminated infection
that was associated with an increase in T cells. We now show acute and persistent extravascular Bb colonization
of the dura mater after both needle inoculation and tick transmission, accompanied by increases in expression
of inflammatory cytokines; in addition, we observe a robust interferon (IFN) response in the dura mater
comparable to that seen during murine Lyme arthritis. Dura colonization is associated with perivascular leukocyte
infiltration and meningitis, demonstrating for the first time that Bb-infected mice can develop meningitis. We also
demonstrate an increase in IFN-stimulated genes in both the cortex and hippocampus of infected mice, despite
a lack of detectable spirochetes in the brain parenchyma. A sterile IFN response in the absence of Bb is
unique to the brain parenchyma and could provide insights into the mechanism of inflammatory CNS
pathology associated with this pathogen.
An unanswered question is how specific bacterial virulence factors, in concert with the host response, intersect
to cause CNS disease. Our tractable model will allow us to directly assess bacterial and host factors leading to
more severe inflammatory CNS involvement, as well as test potential interventions. Our innovative proposal
challenges existing paradigms, utilizes state-of-the-art technologies, and addresses critical barriers to Lyme
neuroborreliosis research. Our central hypothesis is that specific bacterial factors engage the host immune
response in a deleterious manner. We will address our central hypothesis with the following Specific Aims:
Characterize the role of Borrelia genetics on CNS bacterial burden and host response. Working
hypothesis: the severity of the CNS immune response during infection with Lyme disease Borrelia is dictated by
the genetics of the infecting isolate.
Delineate the role of immune signaling and other host responses in the CNS. Working hypothesis: IFN
signaling affects the local inflammatory and cellular activation responses in the CNS.
Modulate inflammation and pathology through targeted intervention. Working hypothesis: Decreasing
inflammation at early time points, regardless of spirochete burden, will reduce meningitis and deleterious immune
responses in the brain parenchyma.
Our proposal directly addresses the NIH Strategic Plan for Tickborne Disease Research, including understanding
both the fundamental biology of, and host interactions with, tickborne pathogens. Our proposal also addresses
outstanding questions identified by the Pathogenesis and Pathophysiology of Lyme Disease Subcommittee of
the HHS Tick Borne Disease Working Group, including what is the role of adhesins in dissemination to specific
tissues. Our robust small animal model will allow us to fully characterize the CNS immune response to Bb
infection, and to mechanistically define factors that contribute to neuroinflammation and disease. Identifying
these factors will elucidate pathways to target for therapeutic intervention. Importantly, the results of our work
will provide more sensitive and specific diagnostic criteria for Lyme neuroborreliosis and its sequalae."

Transcription activation relies on the cooperative activity of multiple transcription factors (TFs) that bind cis-
regulatory elements (CREs) near their target genes. Although techniques like chromatin immunoprecipitation
coupled to sequencing helped uncover the genome-wide location of binding sites for many TFs in different spe-
cies and tissues, it still remains unclear how TFs cooperate to compete with histones, bind DNA, regulate CRE
activity, and drive transcription activation. In this proposal, we will address this knowledge gap by exploiting the
circadian regulation of gene expression by the TF CLOCK:BMAL1. Recent reports from our lab and the litera-
ture indicate that the circadian regulation of transcription by CLOCK:BMAL1 relies on the interaction between
CLOCK:BMAL1 and other TFs rather than on core clock genes only. CLOCK:BMAL1 rhythmic DNA binding
promotes the rhythmic removal of nucleosomes at its CREs, strongly suggesting that CLOCK:BMAL1 gener-
ates a permissive chromatin landscape that facilitates the rhythmic recruitment of other TFs at its CREs. This
cooperation between CLOCK:BMAL1 and other TFs may explain why less than a third of CLOCK:BMAL1 tar-
gets are rhythmically expressed under normal condition, and how their rhythmic transcription can be repro-
grammed when animals are exposed to a new environment. This proposal builds upon these findings and the
proposed experiments will determine if CLOCK:BMAL1 promotes the formation of partially unwrapped nucleo-
somes (Aim 1), the modalities of CLOCK:BMAL1 cooperation with other TFs by using a method of single-mole-
cule footprinting (Aim 2), and if high-fat diet alters the cooperativity between CLOCK:BMAL1 and other TFs to
reprogram CRE transcriptional activity (Aim 3). Results from these experiments are expected to uncover novel
and important mechanisms that control the rhythmic expression of thousands of genes, and to provide a new
conceptual framework for how biological functions are coordinated between tissues. They are also expected to
provide insights into the mechanisms that underlie the role of TF cooperativity in the control of CRE activity that
can be widely relevant to fields beyond the circadian field."
10833193,"SUMMARY
Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in ATP1A3, the gene encoding the catalytic (α3) subunit of the neuronal
Na/K-ATPase, are associated with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental syndromes including the prototypical
disorder Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC), which has no effective therapy. These conditions are
associated with acute attacks of transient weakness and dystonia, and poor long term outcome with delayed
neurodevelopment and brain atrophy believed secondary to chronic neuron loss. Although rare, ATP1A3
mutations evoke neurological dysfunction shared by common disorders such as epilepsy and migraine. While
much has been learned about the genetic basis of these disorders, the cellular consequences of ATP1A3
dysfunction in human neurons and fundamental pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood. We
have modeled the cellular effects of ATP1A3 mutations using neurons differentiated from patient-specific induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We propose to exploit this model to determine cellular pathophysiological
mechanisms associated with impaired Na/K pump activity and the resulting altered ion homeostasis that explain
both short term (hemiplegia, dystonia) and long term (developmental delay, chronic neuron loss) manifestation
of ATP1A3 dysfunction. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that direct measurement of neuronal pump current
can distinguish between haploinsufficiency and dominant-negative mechanisms, and determine if impaired pump
activity can be rescued with a viral ATP1A3 transgene. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that a blunted
transmembrane K+ concentration gradient causes a depolarized neuronal resting membrane potential as a
consequence of lower than normal driving force mediating outward K+ leak current, which impacts neuronal
excitability. We will test this hypothesis by determining if potentiating K+ leak channel activity pharmacologically
or genetically in ATP1A3 mutant neurons will compensate for the blunted intracellular to extracellular K+ driving
force, normalize the resting potential and prevent depolarization block. Separate experiments will investigate
susceptibility to and recovery from depolarization block between mutant and non-mutant neurons, and correlate
these findings with intracellular Na+ dynamics. In Aim 3, we will investigate potential cellular pathophysiological
mechanisms responsible for the long-term manifestations of ATP1A3. We will test the hypothesis that ATP1A3
mutant neurons exhibit a delayed GABA switch and this can be corrected by inhibition or knockdown of the
Na/K/2Cl cotransporter (NKCC1). Finally, we will test hypothesis that impaired Na/K-ATPase activity renders
neurons susceptible to intracellular Na+ overload, which can trigger cytosolic Ca2+ overload and cytotoxicity.
Collectively, this work will reveal important aspects of short- and long-term neuronal pathogenesis associated
with ATP1A3 dysfunction, and promote a mechanistically driven approach to finding new therapeutic strategies."
10833077,"It is estimated that around 15% to 40% of cancers spread to the central nervous system (CNS). The treatment
of cancers with brain metastases, however, has been limited by the inefficient deliver of therapeutics to the CNS.
We propose herein a novel strategy, which enables effective delivery of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), a class
of highly specific and potent protein therapeutics, to the CNS, for the treatment of cancers with brain metastases.
This strategy is based on a nano-encapsulating technology, where mAbs molecules are encapsulated within
nanocapsules of which the surface contains abundant choline and acetylcholine analogues. Such nanocapsules
can be effectively transported across the BBB and deliver the mAbs to the CNS upon systemic administration.
Furthermore, the nanocapsules can be targeted by conjugation with ligands which recognize cell surface markers
on tumor cells. We recently published effective delivery into the CNS of rituximab (anti-CD20) mAbs through
intravenous route using the nanocapsule technology. The nanocapsules were targeted to CXCR5 on the surface
of the tumor cells via conjugation with CXCL13. This therapeutic approach significantly reduced the tumor burden
in the brains of mice xenografted with B-cell lymphomas in comparison with direct native mAbs. In this proposal,
we will further improve the therapeutic efficacy by optimizing the design of the rituximab nanocapsules based on
understanding of the mechanisms of BBB passage and tumor clearance. Success of this project could potentially
enable effective delivery of many other therapeutic mAbs to the CNS, opening a new avenue for treatments of
cancers with CNS metastases."

asked what he wanted to get from participating in our study. His five simple words brought a tectonic shift in
my thinking and provided the deep purpose to my work. Patient’s do not need fancy technology. They need
to feel whole. They need to be connected. As a neural engineer, I develop neural interface technology that
connects to humans. Three additional words are needed to capture my passion and over-arching goal as a
VA Research Career Scientist: I develop nerve interface technology that connects to humans to connect humans.
 For nearly thirty years, I have combined a love for electrical engineering (B.S.E.E., 1992, Michigan
Technological Univ, Houghton, MI) and computation algorithms with fascination of the brain and
neuroscience to develop technology for communicating directly with the human nervous system (Ph.D.
Biomedical Engineering, 1999, Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH). I am one of the world’s top experts
in development and translation of systems to precisely apply small electrical current injections to nerves to
cause targeted action potentials in nerves. Early in my career, I used this technology to restore lost function
following stroke or paralysis by activating muscles. I still actively collaborate with other VA investigators
(Drs. Ronald Triolo, Gilles Pinault, Bolu Ajiboye, Emily Graczyk, and Robert Kirsch) in a supporting role to
implement neural interface technology in clinical rehabilitation programs for spinal cord injury. A decade
ago, however, I became much more interested in the power of the technology to communicate to the brain
through sensory and autonomic systems. My VA activity fits into three area: 1) sensory technology for
veterans with limb loss; 2) hypertension control in veterans that have not been responsive to medications,
and 3) development of advances in peripheral nerve interface technology. Sensory Technology restores
both functional and emotional connection following limb loss of the upper extremity (with Drs. J. Robert
Anderson, Kevin Malone, Kyle Chepla, and Emily Graczyk) and lower extremity (with Drs. Ronald Triolo,
Gilles Pinault, and Hamid Chakhkar). My lab in the Cleveland VA Medical Center is the first in the world
to have a long-term implant of a peripheral interfaces for sensory restoration following limb loss. Eight
subjects, four with upper extremity and four with lower extremity limb loss, have been implanted. Over the
past four years, I have led a program funded by both the VA and the Defense Advance Research Projects
Agency to develop a fully implantable, Bluetooth®-connected system for bi-directional connection between
and external prosthesis and implanted interfaces. My team has secured all necessary regulatory approvals
to start the world’s first randomized clinical trial (RCT) of neural-connected advanced prostheses. Over the
next four years, this study will complete a critical step in moving the technology to general availability for
all veterans with limb loss. Hyptertension: Neural interface technology is applied to modulate function of
complex regulation of blood pressure. In individuals that are unresponsive to pharmaceutical approaches,
we control hypertension through the baroreflex via activation of the carotid sinus nerve (CSN or Herring’s
nerve) (with Drs. Jonathan Baskin, Gilles Pinault, and Elizabeth Heald). The work is in collaboration with a
commercial partner to rapidly advance the technology benefit veterans within the next five years. Advancing
Interfaces: To continue advancing the clinical capabilities of neural interfaces, advances in technology are
continually needed. I continue pre-clinical development and translation of next generation of peripheral nerve
technology. This includes increasing the number of channels on each electrode and the distribution of the
contact throughout the nerve. This includes collaboration with MEMS fabrication specialist in the Cleveland
VA (Dr. Douglas Shire) and Lawrence Livermore National Lab (Dr. Razi Haque) to develop high-density
FINE and interfascicular nerve electrodes, implantation techniques, and high-density inline connectors."
10838425,"Project Summary
People who experience incarceration and have mental health challenges are disproportionately Black and
Latinx, and low-income. This group experiences disproportionate financial hardship regardless of incarceration
due to racism and other forms of discrimination, with associated negative health outcomes. If incarcerated,
financial hardship worsens, creating barriers to community reentry. Support is provided to help people with
income from employment and/or disability benefits, but less attention is paid to aspects of finances including
problem debt, poor credit, and barriers accessing banking institutions. These financial issues have a direct
impact on health, create barriers to employment and housing, stress social networks, contribute to feelings of
exclusion and contribute to recidivism, all of which are health determinants. Financial capability programs
including one-on-one coaching and access to safe and affordable financial products can improve low-income
people's financial well-being and mental health, especially when they integrate into existing services, and
partner to work towards reform of laws and policies to address upstream causes of financial difficulties.
 This project's goal is to intervene at the community level to reduce financial difficulties of individuals
with incarceration histories and mental health challenges, who are predominantly Black and Latinx. We will use
Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) methods to achieve the following specific aim: 1) Change
community level determinants that impact financial well-being and health of the target group by training existing
service provider including: i) community-based financial capability providers to be able to address financial
difficulties of the target group; ii) service providers along the criminal justice pathway to be able to provide
basic financial guidance to target group; iii) financial institution staff to reduce discrimination related to financial
consequences of justice-involvement and mental illness. We will also support community collaborations
working for legal/policy reform that impacts finances of target group. 2) Use mixed methods to assess impact
on community determinants, measuring integration of financial capability support into existing services, ability
of financial coaches to support target group, access to financial products, attitudes, knowledge and behavior of
bank staff, strength of community collaborations, and progress towards changes in laws and policies. We will
assess impact on individuals by measuring target mechanisms (financial skills, self-efficacy and behavior)
hypothesized to mediate the relationship between financial capability support and primary outcomes including
financial well-being and other health determinants (employment, housing, social support, mental health
supports, and belonging), secondary outcomes (health and recidivism) and mediators between primary and
secondary outcomes (hope, empowerment, and mastery). 3) Assess the value of integrating peer support into
community-based financial capability support for the target group by randomizing participants into two groups,
financial capability support only, or financial capability support plus peer support."
10838426,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of maternal mortality in the United States. The burden of
poor cardiovascular health falls disproportionately on impoverished and non-White communities where
structural racism limits access to quality care, thus impacting health outcomes. Social health programming
(SHP) is an intervention designed to mitigate adverse social experiences by empowering communities to
address modifiable risk factors for poor health. SHP for adolescents has been shown to improve health
outcomes and mitigate certain cardiometabolic risk factors, including poor nutrition and exposure to
psychosocial stressors. However, the long-term impacts of adolescent participation in SHP on cardiovascular
health and its impact on future pregnancies are not known. In this proposal, we will partner with a nationally
recognized after-school program offering SHP (Girls Inc., Omaha) to address this gap in the scientific literature.
We hypothesize that SHP with nutritional and emotional resiliency components will positively impact
adolescent modifiers of adult cardiovascular disease. To test this hypothesis, we will compare nutritional
antioxidant status (Specific Aim 1), hair/saliva cortisol levels (Specific Aim 2), and vascular elasticity (Specific
Aim 3) in current/former SHP participants versus age-matched controls. Dietary patterns and emotional
resiliency will be measured using validated questionnaires. Nutritional antioxidant status (a marker of
cardiovascular inflammation) will be measured using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS). Cortisol levels (a marker of psychological stress) will be measured in hair and saliva using
enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). Vascular reactivity (a marker of latent endothelial disease) with be
measured using a VENDYS® test. Our research will inform the design of SHP for adolescents and contribute to
the elimination of sociodemographic disparities in maternal mortality via the mitigation of cardiovascular
complications. In addition to this dissertation research, I have developed a training plan to enrich my scientific
and professional development as a physician-scientist trainee at the University of Nebraska Medical Center
(UNMC). I will achieve the following training goals: build foundational knowledge and technical skills in
pediatric health disparities, develop capacity to independently design and implement research projects, master
written and verbal scientific communication skills, and integrate my clinical and scientific skillsets. Throughout
my graduate training, UNMC will provide essential coursework, grant writing workshops, seminars, and other
skill-building opportunities that enhance my technical expertise and professional development. Altogether, the
research and training opportunities outlined in this proposal will empower me to become an adept physician-
scientist and an innovative leader in the field of pediatric health disparities."

10851029,"Parental lifetime exposures to perturbations such as stress, infection, malnutrition, and to advanced age have
been linked with an increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders in their children. While maternal insults
during pregnancy can directly impact fetal development, the mechanisms by which paternal lifelong
experiences can alter germ cell programming and affect offspring neurodevelopment are not known. However,
transmission of these epigenetic marks to the next generation can significantly elevate disease risk, and if
programmed into the germline can affect future generations as well. Using male stress experience as a model
in which we can examine mechanisms involved in offspring neurodevelopmental programming, we found that
paternal stress significantly altered offspring HPA stress axis regulation and reprogrammed the hypothalamus.
Mechanistically, we identified 9 specific miRNAs in the mature sperm from stressed males that contributed to
the offspring phenotype. Further, we were able to completely recapitulate the offspring phenotype by
microinjection of these 9 miRNAs into fertilized zygotes. Using single-cell amplification technology, we were
identified a novel role for these miRNAs to significantly affect post-fertilization embryo development, providing
substantial evidence that sperm miRNAs are programmable by the environment and are able to transmit this
information allowing for paternally directed embryo development. Therefore, our proposal will utilize our mouse
model of paternal stress to examine: 1) the mechanisms whereby stress alters paternal germ cell miRNA that
affect neurodevelopment and give rise to the offspring phenotype, 2) the transgenerational transmission of
stress dysregulation to a second generation programmed by paternal stress and sperm miRNAs, and 3) the
mechanism within the offspring brain that promotes the paternal stress phenotype through increased BBB
permeability and repressive histone epigenetic programming."
10851032,"Abstract: Acute stress and threat produce physiological anxiety to facilitate planning and allow for
organisms to tune behavior for exploration of the environment, thus serving to promote hyperarousal,
anxiogenic-like behavior and avoidance (i.e. aversive responses). Stress is also directly linked to numerous
mental health diseases and these disorders currently affect ~30% of the US population. The locus coeruleus
(LC) noradrenergic (NE) system and its related GPCRs have been implicated in numerous stress-related
affective disorders including, anxiety, hyperarousal and negative affect. The LC-NE system is a critical
component for integration of stress-induced avoidance. Our recent evidence and the literature suggests that
LC-NE neurons exhibit more molecular, cellular, circuit and functional diversity (i.e. are polymorphic) than
previously thought. It is hypothesized that through these various modes of LC-NE operation, output to
downstream circuits, GPCRs, and behavior are tightly regulated. We propose to isolate and define the unique
molecular-cellular, physiological and neuropharmacological mechanisms regulating LC-NE function in
response to salient stimuli and stress. Recent evidence from our group and others also suggests that LC-NE
soperational modes are tightly regulated by a local GABAergic neuron population alongside a host of unknown
molecular and neuropharmacological components. In the next five years we will focus on a comprehensive
alignment of molecular-cellular, neuropharmacological, imaging, and behavioral approaches to better define
converging characteristics of the LC-NE system in avoidance, arousal and “anxiety-like” responses. Here we
use a multi-disciplinary approach that includes molecular-cellular approaches, neuropharmacology, NE-
biosensors, optogenetics, and in vivo 2p/1p calcium imaging approaches to define the specific cells, circuits,
and receptors within the LC system that mediate stress-induced behavioral avoidance and “anxiety-like”
behaviors. Our central hypothesis to be tested is that the LC-NE system and it’s distinct neurons have diverse
stress/stimuli-responsive molecular and physiological modes in vivo. We predict that LC-NE neuron activity - in
part - determines release NE in BLA and HPC; and unique LC cell types, and discrete neuropeptide/GPCRs,
tightly regulate LC-NE operation and behavioral avoidance. We propose 3 aims: 1) To determine how stress-
induced activation of LC-NE neurons alters encoding and norepinephrine release in the hippocampus and BLA
2) To define the dynamic role of peri-LC GABAergic neurons in the control of LC-NE neuron activity during
acute stress and avoidance. 3) To utilize molecular profiling alongside electrophysiology, sensors, and
neuropharmacology, to decipher genetically defined LC cell types impacted by stress. This confluence of
molecular-cellular, neuropharmacological, physiological and behavioral analysis of LC-NE function will provide
a valuable framework for understanding the complexity of noradrenergic function at the intersection of negative
affect and stress."
10851034,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Growing information from the studies of human glaucoma and experimental models supports that glia-driven
neuroinflammation creates an additional damaging force on retinal ganglion cell (RGC) somas, axons, and
synapses, and its therapeutic modulation can provide widespread neuroprotection. Our accumulated data from
recent studies of neuroinflammation in glaucoma led to our new hypotheses that we aim to test in this project.
Evidently, cFLIP functions as a molecular switch between caspase-8-mediated cell death/survival/inflammation
pathways through TNFRs, TLRs, and inflammasome, Our first Specific Aim will test whether conditional deletion
of astroglial cFLIP can inhibit the inflammatory outcomes caspase-8/cFLIP interaction and prevent/reverse the
inflammatory/neurotoxic astrocyte phenotype in experimental glaucoma. We expect that deletion of cFLIP in
astroglia will selectively target inflammatory/neurotoxic (A1) astrocytes (because these cells are primed for
inflammatory caspase-8 functions through TNF-α/TNFR, Fas/FasL, TLRs, and inflammasome) and will provide
immunomodulation (without risking the glial neurosupport functions). Besides cFLIP, we will selectively target
cFLIPL to also determine isoform-specific differences in inflammatory outcomes and cell fate decisions. We will
analyze spatial and temporal responses to astroglial cFLIP (or cFLIPL) deletion by morphological and molecular
analysis of retina and optic nerve astroglia, including inflammatory responses, A1/A2 astrocyte distribution, cell
death (apoptosis/necroptosis), and neurosupport functions. Elimination of astroglia-driven inflammation can
protect RGCs against inflammatory injury in experimental glaucoma. Our Specific Aim 2 will test this hypothesis
by analysis of neuron survival (by RGC axon/soma counting) and function (by PERG). Astroglia and microglia
closely interplay and regulate each other’s phenotype and immune functions. Our recent research findings also
supported that astroglial cytokine responses may shape microglia responses in experimental glaucoma. Our
Specific Aim 3 is therefore designed to test whether glial subtype-specific deletion of cFLIP (or cFLIPL) can impact
individual contributions and the cross-talk between astroglia and microglia during neuroinflammation. We will
analyze microglia responses (including M1/M2 conversion) to astroglial deletions, and and astroglia responses
(including A1/A2 distribution) to microglial deletions at different sites/time points. Longitudinal analysis will also
include oligodendrocyte and Müller glia responses. Through the analysis of cell type-specific responses (including
the molecular responses of isolated glial subtypes) to glial subtype-targeting mouse models, this project will value
glial cFLIP as an immunomodulatory treatment target to prevent/reverse neurodegenerative inflammation in
experimental glaucoma. Outcomes of this project are also expected to be widely useful in studies of other
ocular/neurodegenerative/neuroinflammatory diseases, aging, stem cell/axon regeneration, and cancer research."
10851035,"Project Summary
Every time we make a saccade, the retinal image of the world changes drastically, yet the world appears stable
to us. Patients with parietal cortex lesions do not have the ability view the world stably across saccades. This
trans-saccadic visual stability (TSVS) problem has received renewed attention since the discovery of receptive-
field (RF) remapping: Some cells in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), frontal eye fields (FEF), and other brain
areas shift their current, pre-saccadic RFs (cRFs) toward their future, post-saccadic RFs (fRFs), even before the
saccadic onset (forward shift). These cells likely contribute to TSVS by predicting and comparing retinal images
across saccades. However, under certain circumstances FEF neurons shift their RFs toward the saccade target
(convergent shift), instead of toward fRFs (forward shift). This raises many important questions including 1)
whether the forward RF shift, a leading physiological substrate for TSVS, actually exists in LIP and FEF; 2)
whether these areas differ in their peri-saccadic RF dynamics; 3) whether LIP and FEF cells have both
convergent and forward shifts; and 4) if so, what underlying mechanisms could explain them. Furthermore, it is
widely assumed that the forward and convergent RF shifts produce, respectively, the observed forward and
convergent mislocalization around the saccade onset, but the assumption has not been carefully evaluated. Here
we will address these questions by simultaneously recording LIP and FEF neurons, modeling circuit mechanisms
for the RF shifts, analyzing the shifts' perceptual implications, and testing new predictions. Our preliminary data
suggest that on average, LIP and FEF are biased toward the forward and convergent shifts, respectively.
Importantly, the convergent shift first appears in a delay period when the saccade command, and thus its
corollary discharge (CD), are suppressed. This leads to our hypothesis that unlike the forward shift known to
be produced by the saccade CD, the convergent shift is produced by saccade planning/attention to the target.
While CD-gated lateral connections can explain the forward shift, we further hypothesize that attention-
modulated center/surround connections account for the convergent shift. We will demonstrate that both
connectivity patterns emerge automatically in neural networks trained on a memory-saccade task related to
TSVS. Perceptually, our analysis indicates that RF shifts in one direction produce either no mislocalization or a
mislocalization in the opposite direction, and that peri-saccadic mislocalization is confounded by mislocalization
induced by retinal motion alone. We will test many predictions of our models including that the forward shift
grows with saccadic amplitude whereas the convergent shift peaks at an intermediate distance between cells'
cRFs and the target, and that convergent RF shifts during the delay period generate a divergent mislocalization.
The project will help resolve a main controversy regarding RF shifts in LIP and FEF, provide a mechanistic and
functional account of the two shift types, and clarify the perceptual consequences of RF shifts. Understanding
TSVS may lead to therapeutic strategies for patients whose brain lesions have interfered with it."
10851036,"Despite its relevance to public health, the integration of substance use services into HIV service settings has
been limited to date. Substance misuse interventions such as motivational interviewing (MI) have been
effective in clinical trials but can be challenging to implement in practice settings, including HIV community-based
organizations (HIV-CBOs) that are essential to HIV care. Since 2014, the proposed research team has
been conducting some of the most innovative, large-scale implementation research on this topic as part of the
Substance Abuse Treatment to HIV Care (SAT2HIV) project. Funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA), this 39-site, dual-randomized, type 2 effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial simultaneously tested
(1) the effectiveness of an MI-based brief intervention (MIBI) for substance misuse as an adjunct to usual care
and (2) the effectiveness of team-focused Implementation & Sustainment Facilitation (ISF) as an adjunct to the
Addiction Technology Transfer Center’s (ATTC’s) staff-focused strategy (i.e., online training + in-person
training + feedback + consultation). Results from the SAT2HIV project showed that the ATTC+ISF strategy
significantly improved implementation effectiveness (i.e., consistency and quality of implementation) and
intervention effectiveness (i.e., effectiveness of MIBI to reduce substance misuse). However, even in the
ATTC+ISF condition, room for improvement in implementation remained. Additionally, neither study condition
resulted in sufficient sustainment. Thus, there is a need for implementation research to identify strategies that
can further improve outcomes beyond the ATTC+ISF strategy. According to implementation effectiveness
theory, implementation climate (i.e., the extent to which implementation is expected, supported, and rewarded)
is a key mechanism of change through which an implementation strategy impacts implementation
effectiveness. Although the ISF strategy already seeks to maximize implementation effectiveness by improving
implementation climate, the proposed research team’s prior implementation research suggests that pay-for-performance
(P4P; i.e., monetary bonuses for achieving predefined targets) is a strategy that may significantly
enhance the effectiveness of the ATTC+ISF strategy. Thus, our research team proposes the SAT2HIV-II
project, a 30-site, cluster-randomized, type 3 effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial to test the effectiveness
of P4P (i.e., compare the ATTC+ISF strategy and the ATTC+ISF+P4P strategy) to significantly improve
implementation outcomes (primary aim) and client outcomes (secondary aim). The 2019 Ending the HIV
Epidemic initiative seeks to end the HIV epidemic within 10 years. This goal is achievable but may not be
possible without improving the extent to which substance use services are integrated into HIV service settings.
Although the SAT2HIV-II project focuses on testing strategies to improve the integration of an MIBI for
substance misuse, the knowledge gained could help HIV-CBOs improve the integration of other innovations.
As such, the SAT2HIV-II project has potential to have a large and sustained impact on improving public health."

This proposal describes a five-year career development program to prepare Dr. Hongchao Guo for a career as
an independent investigator. This program will build on Dr. Guo’s background as a molecular stem cell biologist
by providing him expertise in bioinformatics, secretomics, and drug discovery techniques, and knowledge on
environmental health, immunology and cardiovascular biology to advance our understanding on how genetic
differences in individuals contribute to their susceptibility to smoking-related cardiovascular disease. Dr. Guo will
be mentored by Dr. Joseph Wu, Director of Stanford Cardiovascular Institute, who is an expert in cardiovascular
disease modeling using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In addition, Dr. Guo will be co-mentored by Dr.
Kari Nadeau, Director of the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research at Stanford University,
who is an expert in studying aerosolized pollutants including tobacco smoke on the development of immune
dysfunction in primary immune disease, allergy and asthma. The K99 phase of Dr. Guo’s training will consist of
structured mentorship by the primary mentor and co-mentor, close interactions with collaborators,
complementary meeting with advisory committee members, a provocative research project, and a tailored
program for career development and transition. In Dr. Guo’s previous works, he has recapitulated key features
of nicotine-induced vascular dysfunction in patients using patient-specific iPSC-derived endothelial cell (iPSC-
EC). He has also shown that genetic variants in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor exacerbated nicotine-induced
EC dysfunction via increasing inflammation cytokines expression and apoptosis, which allow for analysis of the
molecular mechanism in iPSC-EC model with a level of depth and resolution never before achieved. With the
current advancement in high-throughput RNA sequencing and the cutting-edge secretomics and drug screening
technologies, Dr. Guo is in a unique position to stratify the patient risk of genetic variants in nicotinic receptors
for smoking-induced vascular diseases, and to study the potential mechanisms, with the ultimate goal to discover
biomarkers and precise treatment for cardiovascular diseases and risks. In the K99 phase, Dr. Guo will generate
and characterize patient-specific and isogenic iPSC-EC models for studying the susceptibility of three different
nAChR variants to nicotine-induced vascular dysfunction (Aim 1). With the platform, Dr. Guo will then integrate
high-throughput RNA sequencing and cutting-edge secretomics technologies to define the key molecular basis
and secretomic biomarkers for the risk of these variants to smoking-mediated vascular diseases (Aim 2). In the
R00 phase, Dr. Guo will develop a screening platform to examine the beneficial effect of anti-inflammatory drugs
and screen mechanism-oriented small molecules in iPSC-EC carrying these risk variants (Aim 3). Collectively,
Dr. Guo’s proposed work will create a valuable platform to evaluate the risk of these variants to smoking-related
vascular disease and to reveal the molecular mechanisms and biomarkers. Additionally, this work will lead to
studying of mechanism-oriented treatment, which will be carried out by Dr. Guo as an independent investigator."

 8 (WT) macrophages even within the same atherosclerotic lesions. Administration of antibodies to IL-1 reduced Jak2VF
 9 macrophage proliferation and improved features of plaque stability. scRNA-Seq analysis of lesion from mice with Jak2VF
10 expression in all bone marrow cells identified a prominent inflammatory myeloid population that was enriched for genes
11 associated with IL-1 signaling. We found that inflammatory myeloid cell abundance was decreased in the absence of the
12 pyroptosis executioner Gasdermin D (Gsdmd), potentially due to suppressed IL-1 secretion. Therefore, Specific Aim 1
13 will investigate the ability of Jak2VF cells to promote inflammatory phenotypes in WT cells within the same lesion through
14 IL-1 signaling. Mechanistically we have shown that the AIM2 inflammasome is activated in lesions from Jak2VF mice.
15 Deletion of Gsdmd from Jak2VF cells leads to increased DNA double strand breaks in lesions. Bone marrow derived
16 macrophages expressing Jak2VF, but lacking Caspase 1/11 have increased reactive oxygen species, suggesting DNA damage
17 occur upstream of inflammasome activation. Thus, Specific Aim 2 will determine if increased oxidized DNA in Jak2VF
18 macrophages promotes inflammasome activation and inflammation in lesions. Specific Aim 3 will then investigate if
19 truncation mutations in the CH variant protein phosphatase Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1D (PPM1D) that leads to inactivation of
20 DNA repair proteins, promotes atherosclerosis. The research proposed here will be accomplished by expanding my
21 conceptual knowledge of DNA damage in macrophages and atherosclerosis and will be complemented by training in single
22 cell sequencing technology to understand how immune cell populations change in lesions based on CH variant status. This
23 training will be supported by rigorous mentoring and collaboration with my scientific advisors during the K99 phase.
24 Together the proposed research and training will elucidate mechanism by which DNA damage and inflammasome activation
25 drive accelerated atherosclerosis in CH which will provide me the knowledge and skills to successfully transition into an
26 independent academic researcher.

This 5th competitive renewal application for an Institutional T32 training grant is made possible due to an
outstanding base of aging research, funded mainly by the NIA at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and
Montefiore Health System. Included as the bedrock for this grant are the following programmatic features:
Einstein Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging (E-NSC, an NIA-funded P30), the Paul
Glenn Center for the Biology of Human Aging (E-Glenn), a hugely popular graduate course in the Biology of
Aging developed specifically for this grant, a very successful hackathon that we instituted for the purposes of
rigor and reproducibility training. Existing grant support for several aging research Programs (3 P01s and a U19)
and significant growth in individual R01 awards show the success of our pool of training faculty. Einstein
continues as a source of mentees, delivers collaborative environments, and fosters interactions with research
gerontologists. Within this collaborative environment lies a strong emphasis on research on the biology of aging
founded upon a diverse group of well-funded mentors, who in turn have access to a diverse pool of potential
trainees. Our training program is built on successful and innovative programmatic and thematic areas of aging
research. We are proud that 82.5% of our previous trainees from the past four training cycles continue in
research-related endeavors, and the data tables in this proposal showing a continuing pool of highly qualified
eligible trainees. Our T32 program has been a success to date based on the quality of candidates, their scientific
and academic achievements, and the number of minority individuals trained. Because of our growth as an aging
Center, we are requesting to continue with three predoctoral and three predoctoral slots, as well as one flexible
slot to strategically fill out our roster with the most exceptional candidates available, irrespective of pre- or
postdoc status. We continue including MSTP students in our program, and their time to complete the PhD has
remained consistent, showing the feasibility of their participation in our T32. With our responsive evaluation
program in place, we have made changes such as increasing our co-mentoring program and adding a highly
qualified Co-Director, Dr. Derek Huffman; shortening training periods for trainees who are not performing well to
make the most of our investment; budgeting for a hackathon to follow up on the success of the previous ones,
and maintaining the popular informal lunch meetings with the Director and Co-Director. Thus, our T32 predoctoral
and postdoctoral training program continues to give participants state-of-the-art research training, exposure to
diverse investigators and fields of expertise in the biology of aging, enabling them to embark on successful
careers involving research in aging and aging-related diseases."
10852811,"Project Summary: The goal of this proposal is to perform IND-enabling studies of a significantly safer variant
of the anti-cancer biologic drug L-asparaginase. L-asparaginases are enzyme drugs that act to deplete the
amino acid asparagine from the blood. Due to toxicity, which is especially pronounced in adults, L-
asparaginase treatment is limited to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a cancer of white blood cells. One
source of toxicity of L-asparaginases is due to their bacterial origin (either from E. coli (Elspar) or Erwinia
chrysanthemi (Erwinaze)), making the naked drugs highly immunogenic. The current standard of care is a
PEGylated version of Elspar called Oncaspar. While PEGylation reduces, but does not eliminate the
immunological challenge of using these drugs, the other toxicity-causing factor remains - this being their L-
glutaminase coactivity. Therefore, Oncaspar is limited to ALL, where even its use to treat adult ALL patients is
highly limited. Of note, L-asparaginase-associated side effects prevent the use of this unique cancer drug in
other hematological malignancies (e.g. acute myeloid leukemia) and in solid tumors (e.g. pancreatic cancer),
despite strong evidence that L-asparaginases would be effective in treating those cancers. Hence, there is a
clear unmet need for an L-asparaginase with reduced immunogenicity and that lacks L-glutaminase
coactivity. Recently, we characterized a guinea pig L-asparaginase (GpA) that possesses the required low
KM property for clinical efficacy and that exhibits in vivo tumor cell-killing. Notably, we also discovered that GpA
is devoid of the toxicity-causing L-glutaminase co-activity. With ~70% sequence identity to human L-
asparaginase, GpA should be less immunogenic compared to the bacterial enzymes that share only ~25%
sequence identity with the human enzyme. We recently identified the lead biologic GpA369 which is a stable
and active C-terminal truncation of GpA comprising the catalytic domain. Here we will perform the required
studies required to bring this novel enzyme drug to patients. In Aim 1 we will increase its sequence identity to
the human homolog using a structure-guided approach and identify the optimal PEGylation strategy. Aim 2 will
determine the pharmacokinetic properties of the top 3 optimized leads from Aim 1, as well as confirm their anti-
cancer efficacy in a human ALL mouse model. In Aim 3, the top variant (optimal combination of PK and anti-
cancer efficacy) will proceed to toxicity studies, first in mice, followed by more extensive studies in rats and
dogs. Finally, Aim 4 will evaluate the immunogenicity of our enzyme drug in a novel mouse model that has a
reconstituted human immune system, and compare our drug to Oncaspar. Together, these studies will bring us
to the cusp of submitting an IND application for testing this novel L-asparaginase in patients. Impact is
predicted to extend beyond ALL, since the improved safety profile of our L-asparaginase variant would enable
its use in multiple cancers for which effective options are sorely lacking and which strong data suggests that an
L-asparaginase drug would be effective but is not used due to the unacceptable toxicity profile of current L-
asparaginase options."

The goal of this competing continuation is to examine the antecedents and health consequences of alcohol
misuse from adolescence through early midlife (the 30s). There is a paucity of longitudinal studies on alcohol
misuse that extend through early midlife in the general population, and the existing knowledge base comes from
studies of singletons, which are prone to confounding. We propose to address these limitations by bringing
together two longitudinal studies of Finnish twins, FinnTwin12 (FT12) and FinnTwin16 (FT16), ns = 5178 and
5563, ~50% female. The innovative longitudinal twin design, which allows us to control for confounding factors
through the comparison of exposures and outcomes within families and within individuals, will add much needed
rigor to our understanding of the antecedents and consequences of alcohol misuse through early midlife. FT12
was recruited at age 12 and subsequently assessed at ages 14, 17, and 22. Under this renewal, we will conduct
an early midlife (age 35) assessment of the FT12 twins (online surveys regarding their current health, behavior,
and environments; a salivary DNA sample; and, for a subsample of participants who have been intensively
studied since age 14, diagnostic psychiatric and life history calendar interviews and laboratory-based
neurocognitive and health measures) and the twins’ spouses (online survey only). FT16 was recruited at age 16
and subsequently assessed at ages 17, 18, 25, and 35. Finland offers a unique environment for conducting the
proposed research, including record linkage to comprehensive national registries and a modern biobanking
infrastructure. Guided by a multilevel developmental contextual framework, our aims are to: (1) Characterize
patterns of alcohol misuse from adolescence to early midlife. (2) Identify factors associated with trajectories of
alcohol misuse between adolescence and early midlife. These include person-level factors such as polygenic
predispositions, personality, and neurocognitive functioning; environmental factors such as parents, peers,
spouses/partners, life events, parenthood, employment, and education; and internalizing, externalizing, and
other substance use problems. (3) Examine the health outcomes associated with trajectories of alcohol misuse,
including measures of physical health, sleep, and life satisfaction. Finally, we will examine the generalizability of
effects using the U.S. nationally representative Add Health sample (n = 20,745), which has comparable
measures and assessments, including a sibling component. The results will provide important information about
alcohol misuse and its consequences through the understudied early midlife period. Through partnerships with
collaborators in the arts and mass communications, we will translate and disseminate our findings to the public
through nontraditional creative content to increase accessibility of scientific results. In sum, this project will
contribute to NIAAA’s goals to identify factors associated with alcohol misuse across the lifespan; delineate the
effects of alcohol misuse on health; and enhance the public health impact of research."
10852922,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 During young adulthood, an estimated one in five women experience sexual assault. We seek to reduce
this violence by motivating young adults to intervene with their peers to prevent sexual assault—an approach
known as bystander intervention. Current bystander training is conducted in group sessions involving
education about how to recognize and intervene in response to sexual risk situations. Although successful in
changing knowledge and attitudes about sexual assault prevention, evaluations of these programs have rarely
focused on changing actual bystander behaviors. Further, while bystander alcohol use is common in sexual
risk situations, and undermines intervention attempts, alcohol consumption by bystanders is not explicitly
targeted in existing intervention training programs. To address these gaps, we will conduct a RCT comparing
the efficacy of: 1) our recently developed bystander intervention, Motivate-the-Bystander (MTB), 2) MTB with
an MI alcohol component (MTB+ALC), and 3) an attention control condition for reducing alcohol use and
increasing bystander behaviors in response to sexual risk. Bystander behaviors will be assessed observationally
during a virtual reality-based house party at 2 months post intervention. Participants’ bystander behaviors,
alcohol use, and relevant contextual variables will be assessed with a measurement burst design using
electronic daily diaries at baseline and 3, 6, and 9 months post intervention. We expect that, compared to MTB
alone and the control condition, MTB+ALC will produce significantly greater reductions in overall drinking and
increases in prosocial bystander behaviors in a diverse sample of 450 young adults who are heavy drinkers. If
our hypotheses are confirmed, results will support the use of our combined MI-based bystander-alcohol
intervention as an effective means of reducing drinking and motivating bystander behaviors among those at
highest risk for sexual violence."
10853060,"Abstract
Our early-stage ADDP proposal aims to develop a novel genetically engineered bacterial biologic to treat the
most common early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including cognitive impairment and other
neuropsychological symptoms, such as anxiety and depression. This debilitating disease imposes a huge
emotional, social and financial burden on society. No effective disease-modifying AD drug exists to dampen the
Aβ and tau proteinopathies associated with disease progression. Current FDA-approved cholinergic and
glutamatergic neurotherapeutics are very modest at best in rescuing memory in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
and prodromal or early stages of AD cases, and often worsen anxiety, apathy, depression, agitation, and other
neurobehavioral symptoms, GI irritations, and even mortality. Recent biological evidence indicates that AD is a
neural circuit disorder. The onset and progression of cognitive and behavioral symptoms involve a deficiency in
monoamine neurotransmitter signaling networks, including norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA). Thus, we
propose that restoring brain DA/NE inputs holds the excellent potential to be an effective approach to alleviating
cognitive and behavioral deficits in AD and could even delay disease onset. Currently, oral tablet dosing of L-
DOPA/carbidopa 3-4 times/day remains the most effective therapy at restoring brain DA/NE levels in humans.
However, this repeated chronic pulsatile delivery causes severe side effects. Thus, our therapeutic hypothesis
to address this unmet clinical problem is that systemic delivery of genetically engineered L-DOPA bacterial live-
therapeutics (LDBL) will avoid large fluctuations in plasma L-DOPA and provide more consistent delivery of L-
DOPA to the brain for restoring DA/NE to stable levels that better relieve AD symptoms without additional side
effects. Our proof-of-concept data support that 1) the genetically engineered probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 strains
(EcNL-DOPA) efficiently produce L-DOPA both in vitro and in vivo, 2) oral dosing of EcNL-DOPA readily colonizes the
mouse gut, achieves a steady-state plasma L-DOPA level that corresponds to the clinically effective plasma
level in humans, and increases L-DOPA and DA/NE levels in the brain of rodents and canines, and 3) EcNL-DOPA
treatment leads to improved neurobehavioral outcomes and reduces Aβ levels in AD animal models including
canines. The overarching goal of our patent-pending ADDP strategy is to optimize the lead LDBL and test
its preclinical efficacy in alleviating the cognitive and behavioral deficits, such as apathy, of early AD.
To achieve this goal, we will pursue the following specific aims: (i) Optimize the lead LDBL for animal testing, (ii)
Evaluate the chronic pharmacokinetic (PK), and safety profile of the lead LDBLs for preclinical efficacy studies,
(iii) Determine in vivo pharmacodynamic (PD) efficacy of two lead LDBLs in transgenic (Tg) AD rodent models,
and (iv) Assess the efficacy of the most effective lead LDBL in canine models of dementia. Together, our unique
therapeutic pipeline strategy involving chronic delivery of probiotic L-DOPA is expected to establish a new line
of engineered microbiome-based monoamine neurotherapeutic modalities for AD-related dementias (ADRD)."

The Center for Cellular Adaptation is an interdisciplinary team comprised of biologists, physicists, and data
scientists embarking a comprehensive project to develop a multiscale, predictive understanding of how cells
adapt to changes in their environment. This research could potentially lead to innovative, holistic therapeutic
interventions for a range of diseases that reprogram maladaptive cellular states.
 The project is divided into three main scientific thrusts, each exploring different timescales of cellular
adaptation. The first thrust aims to understand the adaptive roles of stress-induced biomolecular condensates in
physiological adaptation. Membrane-free assemblies of macromolecules induced during stress were previously
thought to be toxic but are now known at least in some cases to be adaptive assemblies with physical properties
shaped by evolution. By studying condensates in diverse environmental contexts, we aim to link the properties
of these condensates to cellular function and fitness. The second thrust seeks to understand how cells prioritize
environmental responses at the transcriptomic level. Cells typically respond to single environmental stressors by
repressing growth-related genes and activating stress-specific genes. However, it is unknown how cells respond
in complex environments with multiple stressors. We will generate single-cell transcriptomes from yeast and
pancreatic cancer cells under a wide range of environmental conditions to understand how cells prioritize – and
how malignant cancer reprioritize – environmental signals. The third thrust will explore the relationship between
physiological and evolutionary adaptation, aiming to understand how stress responses contribute to evolutionary
adaptation. We will use CRISPRi screening coupled to single cell transcriptomics (Perturb-seq) to test the
hypothesis that the effects of genetic mutations on the transcriptome will be similar to the effects of environmental
perturbations. We will also identify novel phenotypic capacitors that promote genetic diversity in cell populations
to enable long-term adaptation.
 The challenging nature of these research goals necessitates the diverse collaboration of expertise
involved in The Center for Cellular Adaptation. Our highly collaborative research model will be coordinated by
regular monthly meetings involving all Center PIs, collaborators, and trainees to discuss ongoing research.
Additionally, the PIs will meet monthly to evaluate progress as well as elicit feedback from an advisory board of
experts on an annual basis. This integrated, multi-scale approach to understanding cells may provide a novel
unified framework connecting adaptive processes across timescales and the maladaptive processes that
culminate in aging, cancer, and neurodegeneration."
10846637,"The high levels of saturated fat in Western diets contribute to the risk for obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular
disease. Consumption of a fat-rich mean triggers a surge in circulating triglyceride TG levels as well as an
inflammatory response that last several hours. As a result, we may spend a majority of our waking hours in a
postprandial state. Non-fasting/postprandial TG levels are an independent predictor for cardiovascular disease.
Studies in humans of multiple ethnic groups, as well as in the mouse, indicate that biological sex is a key
determinant of postprandial hyperlipidemia, with males experiencing higher postprandial TG levels and
inflammatory response. Knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of the physiological and molecular
processes that differ between males and females to influence postprandial lipid handling and inflammation.
Furthermore, the components of biological sex (which include ovarian and testicular hormones as well as genetic
sex determinants, the XX and XY sex chromosomes) have not been systematically investigated with respect to
postprandial metabolism. Our preliminary studies indicate that a lipid meal leads to substantially higher and more
persistent circulating TG levels in males compared to females regardless of time of meal administration (i.e.,
during a typical fasting or feeding period) or presence of gut microbiota (the sex difference persists in gnotobiotic
mice). Male mice also experience an enhanced postprandial inflammatory response, characterized by increased
circulating monocyte number and inflammatory gene expression in bone marrow cells. Preliminary mechanistic
studies indicate that rates of postprandial lipoprotein appearance in the circulation are similar in males and
females, but that lipid composition and lipolysis differ. Our studies in the Four Core Genotypes mouse model
reveal that the sex difference in postprandial hypertriglyceridemia is associated with gonadal sex (levels correlate
with presence of ovaries vs. testes), whereas postprandial LPS levels are associated with sex chromosomes
(presence of XX vs. XY). We propose to identify physiological and sex-related mechanisms that drive differences
in postprandial lipid metabolism between males and females. Aim 1: Identify the metabolic processes and
bioactive lipid components that promote male-biased postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and
inflammation. We will perform in vivo and ex vivo studies in male and female mice to identify the mechanisms
that lead to sex-biases in postprandial lipid composition, lipolysis, and inflammatory activation. Aim 2: Elucidate
the control of postprandial lipid metabolism and inflammation by gonadal sex and chromosomal sex.
Our studies in Four Core Genotypes mice revealed that distinct sex components influence postprandial lipid
levels and inflammation. We will test the hypotheses that estradiol and/or testosterone regulate postprandial TG
levels (using gonadectomized mice and hormone replacement), whereas the sex chromosome complement is a
determinant of postprandial endotoxemia and inflammatory responses (using the XY* mouse model to compare
animals with XX, XY, XO and XXY chromosome complements)."

 The Chemistry-Biochemistry-Biology Interface (CBBI) Program at the University of Notre Dame is an
established NIH-funded program that supports the training of diverse pool of scientists who conduct
multidisciplinary research at the interface of chemistry and biology-related disciplines. The goal of the CBBI
Program is to produce PhD scientists who work effectively at the interface of chemistry and biology and who are
able to speak the language of two or more disciplines. The CBBI Program has established an outstanding training
environment for our predoctoral trainees. Since 2007 we have trained 84 students, 57 of whom have completed
PhD degrees in an average of 5.14 years (time to PhD degree from CBBI trainees is 4.98 in the past 10 years)
with 19 still in training. Of these 84, 16 are underrepresented minorities (URMs), 10 of whom have already
received PhD degrees. Our 84 trainees have 362 publications, of which 159 are first-author publications. This
represents 4.3 publications per trainee and 1.9 first-author publications per trainee. The 16 URMs have produced
79 publications, of which 31 are first-author publications; this represents 4.9 publications per URM and 1.9 first-
author publications per URM. During the past 14 years, our attrition rate has been low, with only eight of 84
trainees (9.5%) who did not complete a PhD degree. The key highlights of the CBBI Program are: 1) a large and
diverse pool of highly qualified candidates; 2) a strong track record of collaborative and multidisciplinary research
by both trainees and mentors; 3) a diverse faculty group that serves as research mentors and are experienced,
productive, and federally-funded; 4) an intensive, cross-disciplinary research internship in the other field outside
the mentor’s laboratory; 5) multidisciplinary seminars that supplement training; 6) individual and group meetings
with trainees; 7) the annual CBBI symposium that features both oral and poster presentations at the chemistry-
biology interface; 8) program administration with an established track record of training students at the chemistry-
biology interface; 9) a plan and mechanism for continuous evaluation and refinement of the training program;
10) professional development and career placement; 11) outstanding research facilities; and 12) a strong
institutional commitment. We propose to continue to train PhD scientists with the skills and expertise to solve
challenging biomedical problems, regardless of discipline. The University of Notre Dame enthusiastically
supports this training program, and will continue to provide a generous fellowship match to the CBBI Program
and additional resources, including the cost of the research internship for all trainees, upon renewal of funding
by the NIH."
10846720,"ABSTRACT (PROJECT DESCRIPTION)
Novel computational and statistical techniques are essential for enabling the translation of recent scientific dis-
coveries across the widening spectrum of observations from both conventional information sources (e.g., elec-
tronic health records) and emergent methods (e.g., genomics, mHealth, etc.). Indeed, biomedical informatics
and data science are now foundational to both clinical care as well as in the advancement of scientific knowledge
related to human health and disease. These methods are empowering more individually-tailored insights that
can better guide healthcare delivery – the mainstay of precision health. Still, there remains an effective transla-
tional gap that must be overcome, as today’s biomedical informaticians and data scientists need to better under-
stand how to develop algorithms and tools for equitable precision medicine across the wide diversity spectrum
of individuals.
The UCLA Biomedical Data Science Training Program for Precision Health Equity is aimed directly at this pur-
pose, fostering a new type of scientist trained at the intersection of contemporary computational approaches,
biomedical informatics, public health, and precision medicine. Our trainees will be equipped with a technical
depth that embraces these areas alongside an ability to translate such approaches to affect the transform of
healthcare policy and practice with a goal for equitable medicine for all patients. To that end, this T15 brings
together leading scientists and clinicians from across our institution and key areas to provide training in a com-
prehensive, interdisciplinary manner that offers students a core curriculum in topics in clinical informatics, trans-
lational bioinformatics, clinical research informatics, and public health informatics. It will afford trainees opportu-
nities to see the pragmatic issues surrounding precision health and to learn how to address these barriers
through innovative research and engagement. Didactic coursework and hands-on research experiences are
shaped to reinforce technical and communication skills, team science, and a deep appreciation for the socio-
technological concerns increasingly intertwined with precision health. As biomedical informatics and data science
evolves, this T15 sees to an important area of growth that must be tackled to better serve the larger populous.
Our program also makes a further commitment to diversity and equity through our broad inclusion efforts – a
fundamental consideration if precision health is to ultimately be representative of everyone. Our trainees will be
instilled with the critical ability to be forward-thinking, independent scientists who effectively contribute to trans-
formation, working to improve every individual’s well-being through improve computational methods. Building on
our faculty’s extensive experience in mentorship and establishment of groundbreaking scientific directions, this
T15 is set to establish new scientific leaders who will drive needed change to enable precision health paradigms."
10844800,"Project summary
Maintenance of homeostasis at barrier tissues is essential for mammalian health. At these sites, the concerted
communication of different cell lineages is central for integrating a wide range of signals, to promote responses
against noxious stimuli while preventing exacerbated responses against benign stimuli. The skin represents an
organ where neuro-immune interactions may be of major biological significance, as it is one of the largest
interfaces between the body and the environment, integrating signals including temperature, mechanical
stimulus, tissue damage, and pathogenic and commensal microbes. Both the nervous and immune systems are
involved in sensing potentially damaging perturbations and mounting appropriate responses for the avoidance
and clearance of noxious stimuli. Recently, we successfully identified the existence of a cellular neuro-immune
circuit formed by the interaction of sensory neurons and regulatory T cells (Treg cells). This neuro-immune circuit
between Treg cells and sensory nerves is mediated at least partially through Treg cell production of enkephalins,
endogenous opioids that induce analgesia. Through enkephalin production Treg cells dampen nociceptor
activation to prevent exacerbated skin inflammation. We additionally find that other non-neuronal skin resident
populations can produce enkephalins. The work proposed in this application seeks to uncover how endogenous
opioid signaling mediates communication between sensory neurons and immune cells to regulate immune
homeostasis in the skin. Understanding the roles for distinct sources of endogenous opioids may lead to the
therapeutic harnessing of these for the treatment of chronic conditions, and may provide alternatives to the use
of exogenous opioids. In addition, this project will, at a global scale, dissect the heterogeneity of responses in
neuronal populations innervating the skin to different pathological contexts, and how these responses relate to
their interactions with immune cells. This project will provide new insights on the molecular underpinnings of
endogenous analgesics’ role in tissue homeostasis, as well as further our understanding on how sensory
neurons respond to different types of inflammation, two key concepts that may have major implications on novel
therapies for chronic conditions involving pain, itch and inflammation."
10847526,"Non-viral gene delivery systems are limited by their activity and targeted integration capability. Efficient and
targeted integration of DNA into mammalian and human genomes remains a major challenge and its success
would have wide impact for biotechnology and therapeutic applications. The piggyBac (PB) transposon system
is the most active integrating non-viral gene delivery system and is a cut-and-paste DNA transposon that
has been used for genome engineering of mammalian and human cells for more than 15 years. We
have re-engineered the PB-transpososome (transposase with transposon DNA) based on the first-
ever three-dimensional structure of the PB transpososome that we recently published with our collaborator
Dr. Fred Dyda (Chen et al., Nature Communications, 2020). Our next-generation PB transpososome
(ngPB) demonstrates greater activity and potential for targeted integration than was previously achievable. In
specific aim 1, we will engineer and test ngPB for genome engineering of human cells. We will evaluate the
integration site profile and copy number of transposon integrations per human cell. We will modify primary
human T cells ex vivio and test their ability for cell therapy, and we will enable transposase protein transfection.
In specific aim 2, we will engineer and test ngPB for gene delivery in vivo. We will evaluate gene delivery of
reporter and therapeutic transgenes to mouse liver, test for efficiency in development of transgenic mice, and
evaluate hybrid adeno-associated viral (AAV)-ngPB mediated gene delivery to difficult to reach organs. In
specific aim 3, we will engineer and test ngPB for targeted integration in human cells. We will also map the
protein-protein interaction domain of PB known to affect its target site selection in human cells and test PB
protein modifications to allow greater flexibility in manipulating PB genomic target site selection. The
proposed studies will be transformative for genome engineering and have broad impact for biotechnology
and therapeutic applications."
10854878,"Project Summary/Abstract: This project will bring two skin VOC sensors (hand-held, wearable) into clinical
use to improve rapid diagnostics for a range of health conditions. Skin VOC monitoring is a new concept with
potential to transform healthcare. Our hypothesis is that miniature skin VOC analysis devices can be coupled
with vital sign sensors to measure disease signatures in real-time faster than a traditional differential diagnosis.
The proposal has four goals: (1) adapt our current volatile organic compound (VOC) detector into a hand-held
format for gas phase skin-emitted metabolites, coupled to non-invasive vital sign sensors and artificial
intelligence machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms; (2) deploy our hand-held skin VOC system on 20 diseases
over 5 years; (3) adapt our current wearable vital monitoring system to include our skin VOC detector, and use
this to monitor persistent asthma patients for disease flares; (4) prepare for our project and devices to move
through commercial manufacturing, standardization and FDA regulatory approval. To meet these goals, we
plan the following: in Aim #1, we adapt our miniature VOC detection device for skin measurements, and couple
it with 7 commercial-off-the-shelf vital sign sensors (skin temperature, pulse rate, respiration rate, heart rate,
oxygen saturation, galvanic skin response, skin humidity). Our miniature differential mobility spectrometry
detector is coupled with a chip-based preconcentrator and miniature gas chromatograph column for chemical
separation and detection. Individual components have already been developed. Under direction of MPI Prof.
Davis, UC Davis Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, a team of engineers will adapt these pieces
together into a hand-held unit for skin VOC sampling/analysis. Co-I Prof. Chuah will guide development of
AI/ML capability for automated data processing and interpretation from the integrated VOC and vital sign data
streams. In Aim #2, we will use this hand-held system at two different clinical sites to develop AI/ML signatures
for 20 different diseases compared to appropriately selected controls. The UC Davis site led by MPI Nicholas
Kenyon will focus on: 2 skin diseases (eczema, psoriasis), 7 lung diseases (asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, sarcoidosis, sickle cell
disease with respiratory symptoms), 3 joint and connective tissue diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic
arthritis, osteoarthritis), 4 mental health diseases (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, schizophrenia,
Fragile X premutation with mental health symptoms). The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia site lead by Co-I
Audrey John will focus on: 4 pediatric fevers (urinary tract infection, enterovirus infection, respiratory syncytial
virus infection, influenza infection). In Aim #3, our team will combine our current wearable vital sign sensors
with our miniature VOC sensor, and identifying a novel profile for persistent asthma disease flares from both
data streams. Aim #4 will develop a manufacturing, commercialization, standardization and FDA regulatory
pathway for our devices/tests. These efforts are in conjunction UC Davis start-up company SensIT Ventures."
10856925,"Summary
Current chemotherapeutic agents have improved multiple myeloma (MM) patient survival. However, MM remains
incurable due to high rate of disease relapse that originate from dormant MM clones resistant to therapy. Further,
anti-MM therapies have minor effects on repairing MM-induced bone disease, a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality in MM patients. Thus, disease relapse and bone disease remain major unmet medical needs that
require innovative approaches to effectively treat MM. The overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate the efficacy
of novel bone-targeted therapies blocking key interactions between MM cells and cells of the tumor niche to stop
the progression of MM in bone. We will focus on Notch and Wnt signaling, two major signaling pathways
mediating tumor-host microenvironment communication. In studies leading to this application, we generated a
bone-targeted Notch inhibitor (BT-GSI) that selectively decreases Notch signaling in bone. Inhibition of Notch
communication in the tumor niche with BT-GSI reduced MM growth and decreased osteoclast number and bone
destruction. Importantly, BT-GSI circumvented the gut toxicity that limits the use of Notch inhibitors in the clinic.
Further, we found that interactions between MM cells and osteocytes increase the expression of Sclerostin, a
local Wnt signaling antagonist that inhibits osteoblast bone forming function. Blockade of Sclerostin using
neutralizing antibodies (Scl-Ab) prevented MM-induced bone disease by increasing osteoblasts and stimulating
new bone formation. Importantly, our work leading to this application showed that interactions between MM cells
and osteoblasts maintain MM cells in a dormant state, while interactions with osteoclasts promote their
reactivation into proliferating MM cells. Based on these preliminary findings, we propose that combined bone-
directed therapies inhibiting Notch and activating Wnt signaling will 1) decrease MM growth, 2) prevent
reactivation of MM dormant cells, and 3) repair damaged bone, while reducing systemic toxic effects. This
hypothesis will be advanced by pursuing specific aims that employ established mouse models of MM-induced
bone disease and MM dormancy and new pharmacologic tools targeted to the tumor niche. Two aims are
proposed. Aim 1 will determine the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profiles of our bone-targeted
Notch inhibitor BT-GSI. Aim 2 will examine the effects of combined bone-targeted inhibition of Notch signaling
(BT-GSI) and activation of the Wnt pathway (Scl-Ab) on tumor growth, bone repair, and MM cell dormancy."
10854733,"Project Summary
Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the
factors that promote disease risk and resilience may be distinct in men and women. The neurobiological
mechanisms underlying this possibility are poorly understood, however, because the vast majority of pre-
clinical animal research has been conducted in males. In addition, the behavioral outcome measures used to
understand learned fear have focused predominantly on passive, or freezing behavior. We recently identified
an active, escape-like conditioned fear response in rats (“darting”) that occurred almost exclusively in females
and was predictive of improved extinction retention. A better understanding of potentially sexually dimorphic
mechanisms that drive this behavior could open new avenues for treatment of disorders that are more
prevalent in women, like PTSD. We propose here to define the neural circuitry that drives the selection of
conditioned darting vs. freezing, and how that integrates with known extinction circuits to promote extinction
retention. Our preliminary data implicate the infralimbic cortex (IL) in this role, and we will use pharmacological,
chemogenetic, and viral techniques to probe how descending IL projections to the dorsal and ventral
periaqueductal gray (PAG) may mediate a strategic switch between active and passive responding and drive
long-term behavioral flexibility through putative collaterals in the amygdala. We will then use sophisticated
machine vision and machine learning-based tools to define the broader behavioral repertoires within which
darting exists, thereby identifying a multifaceted phenotype that could provide insight into the mechanisms
underlying individual differences in stress resilience and vulnerability."

10854955,"Mechanisms of chromosome motility during mammalian meiosis
Project Summary/Abstract
Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division of the germline that produces haploid gametes essential for sexual
reproduction. A critical step in meiosis is the recombination between homologous chromosomes, also called
meiotic crossover, required for the proper segregation of chromosomes into the daughter cells. Imperfect
segregation prevents progression through meiosis and is a risk factor for infertility and miscarriage. A detailed
understanding of meiotic crossover will enhance the knowledge of meiosis and hold implications for human
reproductive biology. Essential to meiotic crossover is a remodeling process in the cell that involves connecting
chromosomes in the nucleus to dynein in the cytosol via protein-protein interactions spanning the nuclear
envelope. This event allows dynein to move all chromosomes along the nuclear envelope to facilitate the
search and pairing of homologous chromosomes for undergoing crossover. A key player in this process is the
SUN1-KASH5 LINC complex that spans the nuclear envelope to link chromosomes to dynein. Despite the
importance of chromosome-nuclear envelope tethering and motility in mammalian meiosis, a molecular
mechanism for this phenomenon is still lacking. Understanding how SUN1-KASH5 performs its meiosis-
specific function will generate new knowledge to improve the diagnosis and treatment of fertility disorders.
Using a multi-disciplinary approach that includes biochemical/biophysical methods, fixed and live-cell
microscopy, single-molecule TIRF microscopy, membrane protein reconstitution, and a specialized mouse
meiosis model system, this proposal aims to understand how dynein moves chromosomes to facilitate
homolog pairing during meiosis. Aim 1 of the proposal will determine the structural basis, the dynamics, and
the meiosis-specificity of the KASH5-dynein interaction instrumental to crossover. Interrogation in mouse
spermatocytes will complement the in vitro studies to reveal how the KASH5-dynein interaction helps uphold
mouse fertility. Aim 2 of this proposal will determine the higher-order structures adopted by SUN1-KASH5 at
the nuclear envelope and how they enable cytosolic dynein forces to move entire chromosomes in the nucleus.
This Aim and the grant proposal culminate in the dissection of the molecular mechanism underlying infertility in
humans caused by a mutation in the gene encoding KASH5. The proposed studies will reveal how dynein and
LINC complexes come together to facilitate the essential process of crossover during mammalian meiosis."
10854730,"Project Summary
Uterine fibroids (leiomyomoas) are the most common gynecologic tumor in women of reproductive age. Although
these tumors are considered benign, they cause significant gynecologic and reproductive dysfunction. The
molecular mechanisms that regulate the development and growth of uterine fibroids are not well-understood,
which has resulted in limited, non-invasive therapeutic options. As such, uterine fibroids are the leading indication
for hysterectomy in the United States. There is a critical need for new therapeutic interventions that involve
selectively targeting the pathways that promote fibroid growth. We have recently discovered that activation of
the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) promotes uterine fibroid cell proliferation. Moreover, we found that
glucocorticoids induce a unique transcriptional response in uterine fibroid cells compared to normal myometrium.
Studies in tumors of the breast and endometrium demonstrates that steroid hormone crosstalk allows context-
specific signaling supporting tumor growth and is associated with a poor prognosis. Our preliminary data in the
uterus indicates that GR demonstrates crosstalk with the sex hormone receptors, estrogen (ER) and
progesterone (PR) receptor, known factors that induce uterine fibroid growth. A mechanistic understanding of
glucocorticoid action in the uterus is limited, and thus, glucocorticoid signaling represents a previously
unexplored pathway contributing to the pathogenesis of uterine fibroids. We hypothesize that GR functions as a
critical transcriptional regulatory factor contributing to the pathogenesis of uterine fibroids. We propose to test
our hypotheses in three specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will define the mechanisms responsible for the
differential responses to glucocorticoids in uterine fibroids compared to normal myometrial cells. In Specific Aim
2, we will define the molecular mechanism by which GR regulates uterine fibroid cell proliferation. Finally, the
goal of Aim 3 will be to discover how steroid hormone crosstalk regulates gene expression in uterine fibroid cells.
The proposed work is innovative because our studies represent the first investigation into the actions of GR and
the interplay of steroid hormone receptors in uterine fibroid cells. By defining the processes by which
glucocorticoid signaling promotes fibroid cell proliferation, these studies will generate new data to advance our
understanding of this highly prevalent gynecological disease. Successful completion of these studies may open
the door to the development of interventions that selectively target GR regulatory factors or down-stream
signaling molecules of GR for the non-invasive treatment of uterine fibroids."

10854849,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric illnesses and are often resistant to treatment. Adolescence
is a core risk period for the development and exacerbation of anxiety, which often has a chronic course,
negatively affecting academic, social, and adaptive functioning, and increasing the risk for mental illness
through adulthood. Research has highlighted a number of risk factors that likely contribute to the development
and maintenance of anxiety. However, there is limited understanding of the earliest precursors of anxiety or
how multiple risk factors interact within and across development to influence anxiety risk. Prospective studies
beginning in infancy are needed to explicate the origins of anxiety so that (a) biomarkers can be discovered
that identify at-risk youth prior to the emergence of symptoms and (b) preventive strategies can be developed
and implemented with those at risk. The overall goal of the current project is to test the combined effects of
neural, physiological, behavioral, and environmental risk factors on anxiety from infancy through adolescence.
The study aims will be accomplished by following our established longitudinal cohort (R01 MH078829; N=807),
who have provided a rich dataset, including repeated assessments of neurophysiology (EEG, ERP),
physiological stress reactivity, behavioral indicators of threat reactivity, and environmental risk (e.g., maternal
psychopathology, negative life events, COVID-19 related stressors) between infancy and age 7 years. In the
current proposal, we seek funds to support a follow-up study to age 13 years. We will phenotype our cohort for
anxiety symptomatology and diagnoses, across multiple phenotypes, and implement a battery of brain-based
measures, physiological and behavioral protocols, and assessments of environmental exposures, including
exposures of particular relevance in adolescence and exposures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We will
apply a combination of established and novel analysis approaches to develop diagnostic neural biomarkers of
anxiety in adolescence; identify positive and negative environmental characteristics that influence anxiety-
relevant neural signatures in adolescence, that affect anxiety-related neural trajectories from infancy to
adolescence, and that moderate the effects of neural reactivity on anxiety risk; determine how COVID-19
related stressors interact with childhood pre-pandemic characteristics (neural and behavioral threat reactivity,
physiological stress reactivity) to influence adolescent anxiety risk; and to develop assay profiles comprising
neural, physiological, behavioral, and/or environmental characteristics from infancy through adolescence that
robustly predict anxiety trajectories across development. We expect that the findings will (a) improve our
understanding of the neural circuitry underlying anxiety risk in youth, (b) contribute to the discovery of robust
developmentally-informed multi-modal profiles that can identify at-risk children, and (c) inform the design of
innovative strategies to prevent the emergence of anxiety and to treat more precisely symptomatic youth by
addressing and correcting atypical neural processes and their downstream behavioral manifestations."
10854947,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly 37,000 new cases of oral cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2019, and nearly half will
die in 5 years. The lethality of this disease is partially attributed to the fact that most cases are in advanced
stages when diagnosed. Surgical resection remains a primary modality for treatment but local and regional
recurrence remains the most common problem after surgical resection; patients with advanced stage oral
cancer experience recurrence rates as high as 60-80% in the first 3 years. Inadequate tumor excision is a
common cause for such local recurrence. This could be explained by the imprecise methods currently used
for assessing surgical margins and by the presence of “satellite” malignant cells (“skip lesions”) in sites away
from the primary cancerous lesion which occur as a result of the “field cancerization” phenomenon. Currently,
surgeons often depend on their own judgment or visualization under white light to determine surgical
margins. Confirmation of negative margins is based on randomly selected samples for intraoperative frozen
section analysis, leaving much of the surgical margin unexamined. Moreover, frozen section analysis can be
time consuming, expensive, and have a high false negative rate. A more efficient and precise approach is
needed.
Optical technologies can be used to distinguish in situ benign from malignant tissue lesions. Elastic
Scattering Spectroscopy (ESS) is a point spectroscopic measuring technique that can detect with great
sensitivity sub-cellular morphologic differences between benign and malignant tissue. These differences
include nuclear size, chromatin granularity or density, organelle sizes and densities, and other sub-cellular
features. ESS provides the advantage of real-time, objective and quick assessment of tissue morphology; the
optical-spectroscopy equivalent of histopathological readings. Past research demonstrated the ability of ESS
to differentiate with good precision normal versus abnormal oral mucosa, in-vivo, during oral cancer surgical
resection. The first aim of this current study is to expand on that work by further training the ESS algorithms
on a much larger prospective dataset so that the technology can demonstrate clinically acceptable accuracy
standards. The second aim of this study is to design and test novel instrumentation capable of differentiating
between normal and abnormal tissue on both aspects of the deep margin (tumor and tumor bed). One
hundred and twenty patients will be enrolled from Boston Medical Center and from the Boston VA hospitals.
ESS measures will be co-registered with histopathological assessments of dysplasia grade and inflammation
type.
Further refinement of this technology will result in the validation of ESS instrumentation capable of facilitating
intraoperative margin guidance. Our hypothesis is that further refinement of our ESS algorithms will greatly
improve surgeons' accuracy in determining which tissue should go to frozen section, and will help the
surgeon assess proper surgical margins during excision of oral cancers compared to traditional approaches
alone. This, in turn, will significantly reduce local recurrence rates and its associated morbidity and mortality."
10852130,"Project Summary/Abstract:
We are requesting funds to purchase a Hitachi 7800 transmission electron microscope (TEM) for the Electron
Microscopy Core Facility (EMCF) at CU Anschutz Medical Campus in Denver (Aurora), Colorado. The EMCF,
managed by the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, is a campus-wide, institutionally supported fee
for service facility that provides electron microscopy services for basic and clinical science investigators at CU
Anschutz as well as several investigators from neighboring institutions. Currently, the core has only one TEM, a
twenty-year-old Thermo Fisher Tecnai T12, which is no longer state of the art, is frequently out of service due to
failing components, is difficult to maintain and whose service contract will end December 2025. We need to
replace this aged TEM with a Hitachi 7800, which is also a 120 kV TEM, with a high contrast optic design ideal
for biological samples. The Hitachi 7800 has a proven robust hardware system and is especially designed for
easy and fast sample exchange. It has user-friendly software with unique features such as image rotation,
montaging, and pre-irradiation without the need to install secondary software. Acquisition of the new microscope
will greatly facilitate the health-related research of the laboratories listed in this application, as well as many other
laboratories who use the EMCF in support of their NIH funded research. Among other projects, the requested
microscope will be used to study important questions in diseases such as: early steps of HIV-1 infection,
Epidermolysis Bullosa disease, kidney disease, regulation of Staphylococcus aureus colonization and disease,
demyelination and remyelination, formation and function of meninges, and barriers to drug delivery."

 The Institute for Innovation in Imaging (i3) at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) seeks funds to
purchase an LC-MS system with UPLC capability to replace and upgrade a heavily used, aging single
quadrupole electrospray LC-MS system. The current single quadrupole LC-MS has served as a robust
instrument for monitoring chemical reactions, confirming purity and identity of pharmaceutical products and
synthetic intermediates, and detecting stability of target compounds for investigational new drug (IND)
applications. The current single quadrupole LC-MS has been vital to the NIH-funded projects associated with
this proposal. LC-MS is critical to any pharmaceutical or medicinal chemistry research. LC-MS is routinely used
to monitor chemical reactions and to confirm purity and identity of small molecular pharmaceutical products.
Our robust single quadrupole system has supported the chemical synthesis of countless experimental
molecular imaging probes. Among the PIs associated with this proposal, data collected on that LC-MS system
has been included in >100 scientific papers. No credible scientific journal will accept reports of new small
molecule and peptide-based pharmaceutical entities without sufficient characterization of purity and identity,
which are most commonly quantified using LC and MS, respectively. Data collected on the LC-MS system has
been key to the majority of the i3-enabled patent applications and investigational new drug application filings.
The LC-MS also has been used to directly support clinical trials performed at MGH. There is a need to replace
the i3 LC-MS. The current single quadrupole LC-MS is a workhorse instrument for chemists working at the
MGH Charlestown campus. It was purchased in 2013 and is now more than 10 years old. Component failures
are expected with well-used equipment but have become increasingly frequent and costly over the last four
years. In the past four years, the LC-MS had to be shut down multiple times to replace the computer
mainboard, repair leaks in loop injector, repair leaks in the pump valves, repair the multisampler needle seat,
repair the pump motor, repair the electron multiplier on the MS. As of today, the pressure of the HPLC is
unstable when using solvent lines C and D resulting in poor chromatographic separation. As such, users are
reduced to using a single chromatographic condition (lines A and B). Despite having a service contract and
performing daily maintenance, the availability of our LC-MS decreased significantly since 2022, and more
downtime is expected in the coming months as the instrument is approaching the end of its life. The single
quadrupole LC-MS remains a mainstay for chemistry research, but we expect instrument downtime and
maintenance costs to increase dramatically as the instrument continues to age, necessitating the proposed
replacement. The proposed instrumentation will allow us to continue offering the analytical and bioanalytical
chemistry capabilities to NIH-supported scientists and enable or accelerate research activities of 20 projects
currently funded by 6 NIH institutes, as well as emergent projects that have not yet received federal funding."
10854948,"ABSTRACT
Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a common complication of type 2 diabetes (T2D), prediabetes, and obesity,
conditions that comprise aspects of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Strict glycemic control does not treat PN
in MetS, and new clinical guidelines instead focus on improving metabolic health by modifying MetS
components through diet and exercise, though how lifestyle modifications improve PN is unknown. There is a
critical need to elucidate the mechanisms underlying PN pathophysiology in MetS to establish effective,
mechanism-based PN treatments. Metabolically active tissues like muscle and fat develop insulin resistance
(IR) in response to MetS; however, diet and/or exercise increase energy consumption and/or decrease IR,
reversing MetS. Like muscle and fat, nervous system cells develop IR under MetS conditions which is linked to
PN in multiple mouse models. We recently reported that dietary reversal (DR) in a high-fat diet (HFD) mouse
model of MetS improves PN and corrects PN-induced lipidome and transcriptome changes. Our new
preliminary data additionally confirms significant IR in sciatic nerves from this same animal model. Despite our
findings in mice and reports of beneficial effects of exercise in individuals with MetS and PN, the mechanisms
linking improved systemic metabolic health to improved nerve health remain poorly understood. Particularly,
the contribution of peripheral nervous system glia, Schwann cells (SCs), has not been investigated in
metabolically-acquired PN despite the non-cell autonomous nature of PN and a growing importance of SC-
axon metabolic crosstalk on nerve health. Our objective is to rigorously evaluate the effects of DR and high-
intensity interval training (HIIT) on nerve transcriptomics at a single cell level and on whole nerve
bioenergetics, metabolic flux, and function to define the role of neurometabolic coupling and SC-axon
metabolic crosstalk in PN. Our central hypothesis is that diet and exercise improve PN by normalizing MetS
and nerve insulin sensitivity, which restores critical SC-axon metabolic crosstalk and energy substrate transfer
from SCs to axons, normalizing peripheral nerve bioenergetics and function. Aim 1 will assess the effects of
DR and HIIT on global nerve bioenergetics and PN in HFD MetS mice by longitudinally assessing basic
metabolic parameters and PN phenotype, performing SC single cell RNA sequencing, and evaluating ex vivo
sciatic nerve bioenergetics, energy substrate fluxomics (glycolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation), and
metabolomics. Aim 2 will evaluate SC-axon metabolic crosstalk in in vitro models of MetS PN by characterizing
SC glycolysis and β-oxidation, neuron mitochondria dynamics, and global SC-axon bioenergetics. Aim 3 will
determine the impact of SC-restricted insulin signaling or energy transfer ablation on PN in HFD MetS mice by
using inducible SC-restricted insulin receptor/IGF-I receptor or monocarboxylate transporter 1 knockout mice.
This research will have a significant impact by elucidating mechanisms underlying how improving systemic
metabolic health with diet and exercise in MetS patients improves nerve function and ameliorates PN."

This request is for a Nikon CSU-W1 SoRa super resolution (SoRa-SR) spinning disk confocal microscope
with photo-stimulation and photo-ablation capabilities. The long-term goal is to increase our research
productivity by obtaining higher quality and temporally resolved images at larger scales and high content (HC).
Our diverse projects, all funded by NIH, include identifying mitotic errors and genome instability, studying DNA
damage and repair signaling, investigating lysosome and mitochondria trafficking, examining chromatin
assembling and remodeling, understanding pain sensitization and hypersensitivity at the dendritic level, exploring
cytoskeleton dynamics involved in regeneration, cell extrusions, dendritic morphology and synapses formation,
and investigating reproductive tract, kidney and lung development. All these projects have high impact and
relevance to understand how cancer cells function and progress. The photo-stimulation module is required for
Fluorescence Recovery After Photo-Bleaching (FRAP) to study the dynamics of cytoskeleton and proteins
associated with promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies. The photoablation capability is required to study
linkage-specific ubiquitin conjugation at DNA damages sites, measure cellular tension by studying recoiling of
actin-myosin during pulsatile contractions, create gaps within the Mullerian duct to study reproductive tract
development, and to induce cell-cell contact damage to follow actin filament polymerization at forming adherens
junctions between nephron progenitor cells. The SoRa-SR is required to reveal synaptonemal complex
nanostructure inside chromatin, to visualize the apical and basal actin-myosin layers, which are important for
understating cellular extrusion, and to understand the spatial-localization of proteins involved in dendritic
arborization and synapse formation. The SoRa-SR will be also used in combination with HC-imaging to study
mitotic errors that lead to chromosomal instability and it will be needed by many other projects. The need for
live-imaging (short or long term) with optical sectioning combined with the ability to image larger fields of view
in 3D with low photo-bleaching and low photo-toxicity is essential to all these projects. Some projects need to
image large montages in 3D with HC. Other projects need to use multi-well formats to study cells under various
conditions (e. g. chemotherapeutic drugs). Our current spinning disk microscope system (CSU-X1), which is 13
years old, is currently limiting our projects. The proposed system would greatly benefit our research due to the
ability to image a wide range of sample thickness and the needs within our user group (11 Major & 4 Minor). It
would allow us to perform FRAP, live ratiometric FRET and ABLATION, besides performing high-resolution live
imaging, including thicker specimens. During a 10-day demonstration of the SoRa-SR system in our department,
our user’s needs were achieved and in some cases they observed events they had not previously seen. The
versatility of the proposed system will make a significant impact on our research, bringing our core up to date
with new technologies and allowing us to excel in our research at MD Anderson Cancer Center."

the clinical course of infectious disease is coming into sharp focus with the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a
great need both to advance understanding of the basic immunobiology underlying these conditions and to
generate a highly qualified workforce of investigators who will do this work. Recent advances in understanding
of the immune system, along with the emergence of powerful yet complex research technologies in molecular
biology, transcriptomics, metabolomics, human genetics, epigenetics, structural biology, cell biology and
immunology have not only created fertile ground for advancement of understanding of immunological
mechanisms but have made it essential for trainees to develop understanding of and experience in these
approaches. Such training will prepare MD and PhD scientists to advance our knowledge through basic
research, clinical investigation and the implementation of novel therapeutic strategies. Equally important, it will
generate a cadre of physician scientists ready to train the next generation of investigators. The proposed
training program will recruit a diverse group of the most talented and committed young pediatric physician
scientists as well as PhD’s (all postdoctoral) committed to clinically relevant immunology research and will
provide them with an intensive training experience in research in an unparalleled environment. In the year prior
to enrollment in the program, physicians will receive one year of clinical training (not funded by this grant). All
training will be within the general discipline of Immunology, with a broad representation of immunological
disorders (including asthma, food allergy, atopic dermatitis, primary immune deficiency syndromes, systemic
lupus erythematosus, Kawasaki disease) and basic immunological mechanisms (such as tolerance,
immunogenomics, epigenetics, innate immunity, cellular immunology and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2)
covered by an internationally recognized faculty in the Harvard Medical School community. A three-year
training experience is proposed for 9 trainees per year, each with MD, MD-PhD or PhD credentials."
10854976,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Aberrations in lymphatic structure and function are increasingly recognized as a significant source of morbidity
in a variety of disease states. For example, lymphatic abnormalities associated with congenital heart disease
(CHD) that result in increased pulmonary blood flow (PBF) include congenital or acquired chylothoraces, and
immunologic aberrations. Importantly, it is increasingly appreciated that lymphatic abnormalities are not only
associated with a variety of pulmonary diseases but participate in their pathogenesis. Recent recognition that
abnormal respiratory dysfunction often persists years after cardiac correction and is an independent risk factor
for mortality in adult CHD patients has brought renewed urgency to better understand the underlying lymphatic
pathobiology in CHD, which thus far remains largely unknown. We have previously used a clinically relevant
large animal model of CHD with increased PBF (shunt) in combination with isolated vessel reactivity of the
thoracic duct and primary lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) culture, to demonstrate that chronically increased PBF
and the consequential increase in lymphatic flow, is associated with: 1) abnormal pulmonary lymphatic flow and
architecture; 2) increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS)-driven hypoxia inducible factor-1
(HIF-1) activity and metabolic reprograming to support cellular and proliferation; and 3) a KLF2-dependent
decrease in nitric oxide (NO) signaling. In this renewal application we will test our novel hypothesis that in the
setting of increased PBF, the mechanosensory channel Piezo1 plays a pivotal role sensing alterations in
lymphatic flow, triggering downstream increases in endothelin-1 (ET-1) and mtROS driven HIF-1a activity. This
results in decreased NO bioavailability and subsequent lymphatic dysfunction, that contributes to persistently
abnormal respiratory mechanics even after the cardiac defect has been repaired. In support of this hypothesis,
we present preliminary evidence demonstrating: 1) increased lymphatic endothelial Piezo1, ET-1, RhoA, and
mtROS in shunt LECs; 2) Piezo1-, ET-1-, and mtROS-dependent increases in HIF-1 in control LECs; 3) shunt
lambs have abnormal respiratory mechanics and lymphatic endothelial dysfunction that persists following closure
of the shunt, despite normalized hemodynamics, and 4) that treatment with a mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant
(mitoquinone, MitoQ) reverses the HIF-1 mediated shunt LEC phenotype in vitro and normalizes pulmonary
lymphatic architecture and function in vivo. This overall hypothesis will be tested in three inter-related, but
independent mechanistic aims, that utilize integrated physiologic, cellular, and molecular experiments. These
translational and targetable studies include: 1) whole animal hemodynamic physiologic studies, advanced
CT/MR imaging, and sophisticated pulmonary function testing, 2) ex vivo thoracic duct reactivity studies, and 3)
transcriptional and metabolic studies in LECs. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms investigated may lead
to improved treatment and prevention strategies for lymphatic abnormalities in the setting of CHD and other
disease states, including pneumonectomy and other vascular abnormalities that result in increased PBF."

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are one of the most common reason for hospitalization of diabetic patients and
frequently it results in amputation of lower limbs. Of the one million people who undergo non-traumatic leg
amputations annually worldwide, 75% are performed on people who have type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The risk of
death at 10 years for a diabetic with DFU is twice as high as the risk for a patient without a DFU. The rate of
amputation in patients with DFU is 38.4%. Infection is a common (>50%) complication of DFU. In those with
DFU, 40% recur within one year after wound closure; 60% within 3 years, and 65% within 5 years. Thus, the
strongest predictor of DFU is a previous foot ulcer. The proposed work rests on a series of pre-clinical and
clinical findings laying the foundation to the hypothesis that biofilm infection of DFU compromises barrier
function of the closed DFU. Such deficient closure paves the way to DFU recurrence. Biofilms are estimated to
account for 60% of chronic wound infections. In the biofilm form, bacteria are in a dormant metabolic state. The
standard clinical techniques like colony forming units (CFU) assay to detect infection may not detect biofilm
infection. Thus, biofilm infection may be viewed as a silent maleficent threat in wound care. The proposed work
is a two-center study – Indiana University and Stanford University – who were competitively funded with a pilot
award by the NIDDK-DIACOMP mechanism to generate preliminary data on DFU closure and recurrence. The
proposed work addresses a novel paradigm in DFU care that has never been tested in a fully powered patient-
based study. Successful execution of the proposed work is likely to have direct impact on the current standards
of wound care including re-defining the most important primary endpoint of wound care, wound closure itself.
For the first time in a DFU patient-based study, mechanisms by which biofilm infection induces molecular
mechanisms that compromise functional integrity of re-epithelialized DFU will be elucidated. In DFU care, the
proposed work may identify that the current endpoint of wound closure (that does not account for any
functional parameter) may be not the right time to stop caring for DFU. That such premature termination of
care may be responsible for the high recurrence of DFU that is currently reported. The notion that continued
care, until functional wound closure is achieved, is necessary to minimize recurrence and amputation would be
of transformative value in the delivery of DFU care. This proposal, wholly based on the study of DFU patients
seeks to conduct a two-centered robust clinical study testing whether wounds with a history of biofilm infection
closes with deficient barrier function (Aim 2). Aim 3 tests whether such deficient wound closure which
manifests as high TEWL is associated with greater wound recurrence. Aim 1 utilizes this patient-based study to
address molecular mechanisms implicated in biofilm-induced loss of skin epithelial barrier integrity."

Nebraska Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (NE PRAMS) has provided quality
and comprehensive data on maternal and child health risks and behaviors since 1999, and has
become a major participant in the state’s strengthened public health system. PRAMS
complements the vital records database adding nuances that only self-reported data can do.
On the surface, Nebraska appears to have very good pregnancy outcomes. However, the large
percentage (69.6% in 2017-2018) of White births drives state averages, and masks
considerable disparity when outcomes are examined by maternal race and ethnicity. The
Lifespan Health Services Unit is home not only to Maternal and Child Health (MCH)
Epidemiology and NE PRAMS, but also to the rest of the MCH-related programs. These
programs have been among the strongest supporters of PRAMS and users of the data; being
housed in the same unit makes PRAMS data and staff easily accessible to those programs.
PRAMS data has been integrated into the official MCH priorities.
High-quality, Nebraska specific, population-level data are scarce on key factors such as
behavioral risks, and mothers’ experiences with and perceptions of health care. Thus, the birth
certificate registry is limited in its ability to provide detailed information for program planning and
evaluation. NE PRAMS is currently the only readily-accessible source for population-level data
on important issues such as pregnancy intendedness, reasons for patterns of prenatal care use,
nutritional status of the mother, preconception health, and for postnatal behaviors such as
depression, infant sleep position, and breastfeeding. Importantly, PRAMS data allow valid
statements to be made about “new Nebraska mothers” rather than only for selected populations
or program recipients. NE PRAMS stratifies by race/ethnicity and will continue to provide data to
plan strategies to address these issues and for evaluation."
10841003,"Project Summary/Abstract
A fundamental molecular mechanism by which virtually all organisms respond to environmental damage to
their genetic material is by carrying out translesion synthesis (TLS) over DNA lesions. The eukaryotic
Rev1/3/7-dependent pathway of mutagenic TLS is critically important to human health, not only because it can
help cells to survive by tolerating environmental DNA damage, including the repair of DNA crosslinks, but also
because this molecular process is responsible for the vast majority of the mutagenesis that occurs as a result
of damage to DNA. Mutations from environmental exposure contribute to cancer, other human diseases, and
aging. Rev1 is member of the Y family of TLS DNA polymerases, while Rev3 and Rev7 respectively are the
catalytic and non-catalytic subunits of TLS DNA pol ζ. The overall goal of this research is to build on exciting
progress funded by NIEHS grant R01-ES015818 by taking advantage of new developments in human and
mammalian biology to gain detailed new insights into the mechanism, regulation, and physiological
consequences of this Rev1/3/7-dependent process at a level of resolution that has historically only been
attainable using organisms with sophisticated genetic systems such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. A particularly innovative component of this research is to develop a suite of novel inhibitors and
other strategies to interfere with Rev1/3/7-dependent TLS, DNA crosslink repair, and other Rev1/3/7-related
processes. These will not only be powerful probes to advance basic research into how organisms respond to
DNA from environmental chemicals, but also have the potential to improve chemotherapy and possibly other
aspects of human health. One major strategy is to identify small molecules that inhibit Rev1/3/7-dependent
mutagenic TLS by interfering with critical interactions required for operation of the pathway, such as the
interaction of the Rev1 100 amino acid C-terminal domain (CTD) with the Rev7 component of DNA pol ζ
through one interface and the RIR (Rev1-interacting region) of other TLS DNA polymerases through a second
interface. Exemplar compounds have already been identified that bind to each Rev1 Interface and have the
expected biological effects. These will be evaluated in syngeic mouse models of human lung cancer and
lymphoma as possible chemotherapy adjuvants that increase killing while also reducing the mutagenesis that
gives rise to resistance. Other innovative approaches to inhibiting Rev1/3/7-dependent mutagenic TLS include
using stapled RIR peptides, using the Anthrax Protective Antigen to deliver the Rev1 CTD into mammalian
cells by fusing it to the N-terminus of Lethal Factor, and testing whether Rev7-interacting sequences can serve
as dominant negative inhibitors by trapping Rev7 in nonproductive complexes. In a complementary approach,
a series of partial-loss-of-function mutants affecting proteins in the Rev1/3/7-dependent-pathway will yield
detailed functional insights into the complex protein choreography that underlies the crucial roles of mutagenic
TLS in DNA damage tolerance, crosslink repair, and mutagenesis from environmental chemicals."

The Florida Department of Health, Division of Community Health Promotion along with
state partners understand the need to collect, analyze, and disseminate population-
based data on maternal and child health indicators (MCH) of high scientific quality. The
purpose of the Florida Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS)
project is to conduct surveillance of select maternal behaviors and experiences before,
during, and shortly after pregnancy from women in the state of Florida who recently
experienced a live birth. Their response to the survey will afford Florida the opportunity
to improve resources, health care, and programs available to women and children
across the state.
Objectives and specific aims of Florida PRAMS are to: (1) collect population-based data
of high scientific quality on topics relative to pregnancy and early infancy; (2) perform
data analysis in efforts to increase understanding of maternal behaviors and
experiences during pregnancy and early infancy, and their relationship to health
outcomes; (3) translate results from analyses to useable information for planning and
evaluation of public health programs and policy; and (4) build high functioning state
capacity that will allow transparency and sharing of data analyses findings.
To achieve specific aims of PRAMS, Florida PRAMS intends to ensure that data
collection activities align with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
PRAMS protocol by administering surveys to the sample population via US mail and
follow-up of non-responders by telephone. Inclusion of a sample population that will
transcribe into data analyses will be the foundation of understanding and guiding state
and CDC PRAMS MCH issues, programs, and resources.
Collection of PRAMS data will ensure that Florida PRAMS can benchmark and measure
State Maternal and Child Health Priorities such as, reduce infant mortality and related
disparities, prevent pregnancy-related mortality and maternal morbidity, and reduce
racial disparities. To conclude, Florida PRAMS will continue to engage and collaborate
with state and local partners, and data users to address state-specific needs which align
with PRAMS goals."
10839581,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 A fundamental feature of a living system is its integrated network of biochemical pathways that respond to
endogenous and environmental stresses. In humans, there is a strong connection between metabolic network
dysfunction and disease, while in microbes metabolic network structure dictates organismal capabilities,
including pathogenesis. Metabolic strategies are conserved across biology, and insights obtained from model
organisms provide the means to advance our understanding of general metabolic paradigms, which can often
be extrapolated to higher organisms including humans. The PI's laboratory utilizes a broad approach that
includes in vivo genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, bioinformatics, proteomics, and metabolomics and
other global approaches to address timely questions in metabolism. In the long-term, the PI's research will
contribute to the understanding of the structure and integration of bacterial metabolic networks, how they
respond to perturbation, and how specialized capabilities (e.g., causing disease) are integrated into
metabolism. Reaching this vision will require the rigorous definition of metabolic components and their
integration, which together form the complex system of metabolism. Knowledge of fundamental metabolic
processes and a mechanistic understanding of functional components is critical to efforts aimed at treating
metabolic diseases, defining pathogenic strategies, and targeting metabolism for rational drug design,
synthetic biology, microbiome research, etc. Efforts in the next five years focus on, i) extending the
understanding of the RidA stress system, ii) comparing the endogenous stress systems of multiple microbes,
iii) identifying functions of additional Rid protein family members, iv) integrating results from these studies into
the metabolism of pyridoxal phosphate, and v) defining a function for the conserved YggS protein. Notably, the
human YggS homolog (i.e., PROSC) is a biomarker in B6 epilepsy in humans. The goals of this proposal will
be accomplished through a combination of chemical, biochemical, molecular genetics, bioinformatics and
global approaches. The work here is motivated by our desire to understand the complex system of metabolism,
specifically understanding metabolic stress generated by the production of reactive metabolites during growth,
how such stress can damage cellular components if not neutralized and discovering a unifying role for the
members of the broadly conserved Rid protein superfamily family."

Reducing suicide deaths and premature mortality among youth with depression has been identified as a
national priority and important goal for health systems. Effective, evidence-based pharmacological and
psychosocial therapies exist to treat pediatric depression and clinical practice guidelines, quality indicators, and
medication algorithms have been developed in an effort to apply evidence-based practices to its real-world
management. Unfortunately, little is known about the degree to which the depression care delivered to publicly
insured youth meets existing quality standards, and these widely accepted standards have not been properly
validated, meaning that the impact of care meeting quality standards on important patient outcomes such as
recurrence of depression, self-harm, suicide, and overall mortality is essentially unknown. Relatedly, although
the landmark Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded Medicaid eligibility and mandated
that mental health services be included as basic Medicaid services, whether expanded insurance coverage for
Medicaid enrolled youth has improved depression care quality and/or outcomes is unknown. Specific aims of
this proposed study are three-fold: 1) to identify patient, provider, community and system factors associated
with guideline concordant care for youth with major depressive disorder (MDD); 2) to determine whether
guideline concordant care is associated with depression recurrence, self-harm, suicide, and all-cause mortality;
and 3) to determine the effect of state Medicaid expansion under ACA on access to and quality of care for
Medicaid enrolled youth with MDD. We propose to conduct a retrospective longitudinal cohort study using
national Medicaid data linked with National Death Index records of all youth aged 10-17 (N= 350,00) with new
episodes of MDD between 2015 and 2019. These youth will be followed for up to 24 months up until 2019. Cox
regression models will be used to examine the association between 12 -month mortality and 5 patient-level
quality measures, while risk-adjusting for patient characteristics using propensity score methods. Quality
measures include: 1) effective antidepressant management during the acute phase; 2) effective antidepressant
management during the continuation phase; 3) adequate antidepressant dosage; 4) optimal provider contacts
among those taking antidepressants; and 5) adequate dose of psychotherapy. The contribution of the
proposed research is expected to be an increased understanding of factors that impact adherence to quality of
care treatment guidelines for depression. In addition, the proposed study will help narrow the gap between
community practice and optimal care by determining which recommended clinical practice guidelines improve
critical outcomes for youth with MDD. This contribution will be significant because understanding factors
associated with adherence to guideline concordant care will enhance our ability to develop models of
interventions to modify those factors and processes to increase adherence."
10840680,"Approximately one-quarter of all proteins synthesized in human cells integrate into the membrane of the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as they are translated. However, membrane protein folding is problematic. First,
structurally diverse integral membrane proteins face the challenge of folding co-translationally and post-
translationally in three chemically distinct environments: the ER lumen, the ER membrane, and the cytoplasm.
Second, many of these transmembrane domain (TMD)-containing proteins transport ions and other hydrophilic
solutes, so sequences within TMDs favor amino acids containing charged and polar side chains. While these
amino acids facilitate substrate transport, they are also inherently unstable in the membrane. And third, most
ion channels and transporters are oligomeric, so each subunit must find its partner(s) after membrane
insertion. As a result of these hurdles, membrane proteins fold inefficiently, and inherited mutations can further
compromise folding efficiency. To overcome toxic effects arising from misfolded protein accumulation, the ER
is equipped with a pathway to remove nonnative and incompletely assembled species. This disposal pathway,
first reconstituted and named by the PI, is known as ER associated degradation (ERAD). To date, nearly 70
substrates, most of which are membrane proteins, are linked to various diseases and arise from the targeted
destruction of misfolded proteins in the ER. Since its discovery, the PI’s long term research objectives have
been to dissect individual steps during ERAD. This pursuit has focused on the molecular mechanisms
underlying substrate selection, retrotranslocation from the ER into the cytosol, ubiquitination, and degradation
by the 26S proteasome. In parallel, the Brodsky lab has helped define the molecular etiology of nearly a dozen
diseases. Yet, critical unanswered questions in the ERAD field remain, including: (1) How does the ERAD
pathway handle aggregation-prone membrane proteins, which might be difficult to retrotranslocate from the ER
membrane? (2) Are other pathways required to eliminate these toxic aggregated species? (3) What is the
mechanism that prevents misfolded integral membrane ERAD substrates from trafficking beyond the ER? (4)
Can “new” mutant alleles in human genes that encode misfolded ion channels be rapidly identified and
characterized? This last question reflects the first step toward developing personalized therapies for loss-of-
function ERAD-associated diseases. To answer these questions, the lab will capitalize on emerging techniques
in diverse model systems, each with unique strengths, as well as ongoing collaborations. Innovative tools,
which are new to the field, will also be used. Together, the proposed research objectives lie at the heart of the
lab’s long-term research goals, will address critical knowledge gaps, employ experimentally rigorous and
transdisciplinary strategies, provide the research community with novel methods to address other unanswered
questions in cell biology, and lead to the generation of new testable hypotheses."

Most biological systems consist of many components (proteins, RNAs) that work together in a cooperative
manner to carry out specific functions, for example the ribosome for protein synthesis and the bacterial flagellar
motor for locomotion. One of the most important questions in biology is how “structure determines function”. As
the structural information for these complexes becomes available thanks to the recent development of high
resolution techniques such as Cryo-electron microscopy and tomography, the challenge is how this structural
information can be used to understand functions of these large complexes. The overall goal of this project is to
address this challenge by developing structure-based models to bridge the gap between structure and function
for large biological complexes. The structure-based mathematical models, which explicitly include interactions
of different components in the complex based on the complex structure, will be used to study/understand the
emergent dynamic properties of the complex and its input-output relationship in wildtype complex and different
mutants.
In the next funding period, we will focus on studying the structure, function, and dynamics of two large protein
complexes that are ubiquitous in the bacteria kingdom. The first functional complex we will study is the
bacterial MCP chemoreceptor cluster, which serve important cellular functions such as signal amplification and
enhancing adaptation. The fine structure of the MCP cluster is solved by cryo-EM studies, which show that the
core functional unit consists of 2 trimers of dimer (TOD) of the MCP receptors connected by two CheW
molecules and one CheA dimer and these basic units connect with each other through interactions between
CheW and CheA to form a regular two dimension lattice with six-fold symmetry. In this project, we plan to
develop a model of the chemorecptor cluster that include all pair-wise interactions among the key proteins
(MCP receptor, CheW, and CheA) based on the fine structure of the chemoreceptor clsuter, and use it to
investigate the molecular mechanism underlying signal amplification, the functional role of the coupling protein
CheW, and statistics of the stochastic switching dynamics of the MCP cluster in single cells. The second
functional complex we plan to study is the bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) complex, which drives the motility
and chemotaxis motion of bacteria. Recent cryo-EM studies of the BFM stator structure showed that the power
generating stator unit consists of a MotB dimer surrounded by a MotA pentamer ring, which suggested a new
mechanism for how proton-motive-force(PMF) is used to generate rotation of the rotor and how BFM switch
between clockwise (CW) and counter clockwise (CCW) rotations. In this project, we plan to develop a
structure-based model that describes the interactions between MotA and MotB in the stator unit and those
between MotA and FliG subunits of the rotor as well as the proton-assisted conformational changes in the
stator unit based on the stucture of the BFM complex. We will use the struture-based model to
understand/explain all the relevant BFM behaviors which include the PMF-driven rotational dynamics, the CW-
CCW switching dynamics, and the mechano-adaptation in BFM within the same unified modeling framework.
Although we will initially focus on the MCP cluster and the BFM complex, we will look out for other
opportunities in modeling functions and dynamics of other protein complexes.
Throughout our study, results from our models will be compared with exsiting experimental data to guide the
model development, and the predictions from our models will be tested in our collaborators’ labs to further
verifiy and refine/improve them. Combined with quantitative functional measurements, the structure-based
models can be used to explain expeirmental observations under different external and internal conditions
within an unified structure-based framework, and they may also reveal possible new molecular mechanisms
underlying the structure-function relation in large multicomponent complexes. This general approach should be
applicable to study other large biomolecular complexes."

The establishment of tools and methods from statistical mechanics and computer simulation technology to
enable the exploration of biological molecules and their interactions plays a central role in discovery within
biomedical research. This proposal represents a request for support of our ongoing efforts in this area and
includes objectives to address challenges in the theory and modeling associated with these problems, as well
as strategically chosen collaborations that will help elucidate important biomedical questions and provide crucial
tests of the approaches we develop. Our proposed development efforts include the exploration of receptor-ligand
interactions and the thermodynamics of ligand binding to biological receptors through the continued development
and application of novel methods of free energy simulations to ligand binding thermodynamics, docking and
receptor-ligand interaction modeling. The continued refinement, hardening and application of theoretical and
computational methods of constant pH molecular dynamics to integrate the critical aspects of pH and protonation
state changes in protein and nucleic acid receptors and their ligands in molecular simulations and modeling
represents another challenge we will continue to address with the proposed work. Finally, software
infrastructure, specifically the CHARMM macromolecular simulation package, provides the framework for
advancing our methodological approaches and enabling the broader community to explore biomedically
motivated questions via its wide usage and distribution. A component of our proposed efforts will be to continue
the innovative implementation of methods and simulation approaches into this community standard software
package. We will balance and drive our development efforts in the areas of free energy simulations, ligand –
receptor docking and pH-mediated structure-function processes, important to a deeper mechanistic
understanding of biomedically directed questions, through strategic collaborations with experimental colleagues
in the areas of: transcriptional activation based on small amphipathic molecules targeting co-activators from the
CREB binding protein (KIX) and the AciD domain of Med25; kinases with a specific focus on discovering sites
for allosteric control of conformational changes and the discovery and design of ligands to control these
dynamics; enzyme redesign and substrate scope expansion to better understand the evolution of function of a
novel Flavin-dependent hydroxylase in exploiting complex chemical transformations important in the
development of pharmaceuticals; the pH-modulated switch for myristoylated histactophilin, the actin binding
protein that is structurally homologous with interleukin-1b and fibroblast growth factor. Finally, we will engage
experts in the development of improved sampling methods for ligand-binding free energy calculations and big
data applications of molecular simulations and the design and execution of robust user APIs to work with us
toward advancing objectives in software development for automated workflows, through pyCHARMM, for
sophisticated simulation protocols."
10843203,"This R35 Research Program proposal will use electrophysiological, molecular, and structural approaches to
probe multiple aspects of excitatory synaptic function that are relevant for neurological disease. We will focus on
the elucidation and modulation of the functional properties of postsynaptic glutamate receptors. We will take
advantage of coincident advances in cryoEM, genetics, robotics, and receptor biology to address questions that
were previously inaccessible. Four approaches will address critical gaps in our understanding of synaptic
function and provide therapeutically-relevant insight into neurological disease.
First, we will explore the functional and clinical implications of regional intolerance for variation in the healthy
population as well as de novo disease-associated glutamate receptor mutations, most commonly found in GRIN1,
GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2D, genes that are among the least tolerant in the genome. We will establish the
relationship in healthy individuals between allelic frequency and functional changes, which is necessary in order
to understand the potential role of SNPs in these genes as disease risk factors. Evaluation of these rare variants
will also provide opportunities for precision medicine, and advance our understanding of receptor function.
Second, we will develop novel compounds for proof-of-concept studies to identify new therapeutic strategies for
neurological disorders. We will synthesize subunit-selective modulators of agonist potency and channel open
probability to assess the roles of understudied NMDA receptor subunits (e.g. GluN2C, GluN2D) in circuits in
cortex, thalamus, and striatum. We will determine the site and mechanism of action of modulators of NMDA
receptors, and use medicinal chemistry to improve brain penetration, potency, and solubility in collaboration
with Dennis Liotta in Chemistry at Emory. We will use the pharmacological tools that we develop to gain insight
into the treatment of epilepsy, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease.
Third, we explore biased modulators of NMDA receptors by developing the SAR of two classes of compounds
that alter ion channel selectivity. These compounds represent the first example whereby a pharmacological
agent can alter channel permeation properties, demonstrating that modulators can tune distinct functions of the
NMDA receptor. These compounds hold enormous potential as neuroprotectants that diminish cation flux
without side effects associated with receptor blockade, which we will evaluate in vivo in models of ischemia.
Fourth, we will combine information obtained through genetic analysis of regional intolerance, mechanism of
allosteric modulation, and new advances in structural biology to advance our understanding of the mechanisms
that convert glutamate binding to channel opening. These experiments will focus on the shared regions of the
protein that control channel opening, which are the key sites of action of our allosteric modulators and common
sites for disease-associated human mutations. We will collaboratively perform cryoEM and crystallographic
studies to determine the binding site for modulators, as well as key features of channel structure and function."

Intellectual disabilities (ID) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by difficulties in memory,
cognition, and adaptive function by the age of 18. Whole exome sequencing from patients with ID reveals
mutations in the genes encoding KDM5A, B, and C. One to three percent of X-linked ID (X-LID) is attributed to
the highly neuronally expressed paralog KDM5C. KDM5 proteins are best known for their enzymatic
demethylation of H3 that is tri-methylated on lysine 4 (H3K4me3), a chromatin modification associated with
transcriptionally active promoters. Though Kdm5c knockout mice show cognitive phenotypes, no clinically
relevant pathways have been identified and the mechanism by which KDM5 regulates transcription is still
unclear. Drosophila possess a single, well conserved ortholog of KDM5 in which we can model patient-
associated ID mutations to understand their effects on neuronal development. A previous study from our lab
modeling ID mutations in Drosophila reveals a reduction in expression of ribosomal protein genes (RPG), total
protein translation, and defects in both short and long-term memory. De novo translation is necessary for memory
formation and is found to be altered in several ID disorders. Importantly, restoring translational defects are an
emerging and potentially therapeutic means to improve the cognitive function of individuals with ID. Hindering
the development of any therapies is a lack of understanding of how KDM5 functions molecularly to regulate the
expression of RP and other genes, the extent to which this requires its canonical histone demethylase activity,
and how KDM5 function is altered by ID-associated mutations. Here, we specifically address these key issues
by systematically decoding the role of KDM5 in RPG expression by assessing promoter H3K4me3 levels, the
KDM5 interactome, and how these are altered by ID mutations."

6.2 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), experiencing reduced quality of life and
irreversible deterioration of cognitive function. AD development is likely driven by inflammation in the central
nervous system (CNS), yet there remain no broadly effective therapies. We propose that AD pathology may be,
in part, caused by circadian dysregulation of peripheral immune cell migration through the CNS. The circadian
clock is a critical regulator of biological processes, generating ~24 h rhythms in gene expression, hormone
release, and behavior, but its efficacy in various cells and tissues deteriorates with age. Up to 70% of individuals
with AD experience circadian disruption and sleep-wake disturbances, which often present years before clinical
diagnosis. Circadian dysregulation is therefore a potential biomarker and signal for early intervention in age- and
AD-related pathology. The immune system is tightly regulated by the circadian clock, generating daily cycles of
immune cell migration throughout the body which leads to temporal windows of high and low immune reactivity.
The immune system also critically regulates CNS function; peripheral inflammation disrupts behavior and impairs
cognition. During aging, the CNS immune system gradually shifts from a balance between pro- and anti-
inflammatory function towards a more reactive inflammatory state. Importantly, trafficking of adaptive immune
cells to immune-brain interfaces regulates neuroinflammation and cognition. Thus, we hypothesize that circadian
rhythms in immune cell trafficking to the CNS are disrupted with age and AD-like pathology, leading to cognitive
and behavioral changes. This proposal addresses the following specific aims: First, establish the role of circadian
dysregulation of immune cell trafficking in CNS inflammation and cognitive decline during aging and AD-like
pathology; second, determine if disruption of molecular clocks in key brain-immune interface cells expedites
cognitive decline during aging and AD-like pathology; and third, reveal whether reinstating daily trafficking
rhythms via time-restricted feeding ameliorates age- and AD-induced pathology. This proposal is innovative in
combining expertise in circadian biology, immunology, and behavioral neuroscience to understand how circadian
regulation of brain barriers and immune cell trafficking through the CNS regulates aging and AD-like pathology.
This contribution will be significant because our results will identify how circadian regulation of adaptive immune
cell migration through the CNS affects local neuroimmune function. We expect that our results will identify a
novel role for biological rhythms in regulating neuroinflammatory pathology and cognition via immune cell
migration, highlighting novel therapeutic avenues to target cognitive decline and behavioral changes in aging,

10843677,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
By 6 years of age 73% of Alaska Native (AN) children in the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) region of
southwestern Alaska have had a full mouth dental reconstruction (FMDR), requiring general anesthesia
for extensive early childhood caries (ECC). ECC, defined as “the presence of one or more decayed, missing
(due to caries) or filled tooth surfaces in any primary tooth in a child between birth and 71 months of age”,
affects sleep, eating habits, and performance in school. Reasons for high ECC rates include lack of community
water fluoridation, high consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and remoteness from dental care.
Care coordination has been recommended as a method for improving the reach and coordination of
dental services among health care providers, care systems, and parents, to promote healthy, pain-free
childhoods. Through coordination of services and education of parents, ECC could be mitigated by prevention
counseling (e.g. oral hygiene, reduced sugar) and dental interventions initiated before age 24 months.
The Y-K region is the home of 50 remote communities and approximately 5,000 children age <6 years; medical
and dental care is provided by one Tribal Health Organization. Health care in the communities, including well
child visits, is provided by community health aide/practitioners (CHA/Ps). In 7 communities, dental health care
is provided by dental health aide therapists (DHATs) co-located with CHA/Ps in community clinics. DHATs
provide preventive care and education, oral exams and non-surgical extractions.
Data indicate only 12% of Y-K children have an oral exam by age 24 months; in contrast almost 80% obtained
standard vaccinations, which require 5 visits. The difference in accessing pediatric and dental services could
be mitigated through care coordination. Unfortunately, CHA/Ps and DHATs work independently of each other
and use different electronic medical and dental record systems. There is a critical need to coordinate care
in a way that includes parent education on effective oral health practices and alignment of well child
visits with dental visits early in a child's life.
We propose a mixed methods comparative clinical effectiveness trial to study whether the use of care
coordinators to educate caregivers and to assist in coordination between well child visits and dental visits at
ages 0-24 months increases the proportion of children who receive oral health exams and interventions and
reduces the incidence of ECC in AN children. Our specific aims are: (1) to explore facilitators and barriers to
oral health care including the integration of dental and well child visits for children ages 0-24 months, and
identify stakeholder-based outcomes of interest, (2) to design an implementation plan for integrating a care
coordinator (CC) position into the well child visit workflow, to systematically reach children for an oral health
exam prior to age 24 months, (3) to compare stakeholder-reported, implementation process and clinical
outcomes in communities with and without CCs.
The results of this study will provide Tribal Health Organizations, and health care systems where dental and
pediatric care are co-located, with an evidence-based model for delivering integrated clinical care to improve
oral health."

First, to reveal the role of BDH1 in NASH-relevant liver injury, mice lacking BDH1 selectively in hepatocytes will be interrogated using tracer-based mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mitochondrial bioenergetics studies, together supporting sophisticated quantifications of carbon, electron, proton, and oxygen fluxes to construct relationships between mitochondrial efficiency and NAFLD-like pathogenesis. In the Second Aim, tracer and flux-based approaches will quantify the effects of ketone body exchange between hepatocytes and neighboring macrophages in NASH-like pathogenesis, using mice that lack succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid-CoA transferase (SCOT), which is required for AcAc oxidation in macrophages.

Cells are highly dynamic entities that are pulling and pushing on one another and on their surroundings.
Understanding these minuscule forces is the key for unraveling important biological processes. However, a major
challenge in cell biology is the lack of molecular probes to visualize and quantify cellular forces. Here, I propose
to use state-of-the-art DNA nanotechnology to develop next-generation molecular probes and nanodevices to
address important challenges in mechanobiology, an emerging multidisciplinary field that encompasses the study
of mechanisms by which cells sense and respond to mechanical signals. As an expert in DNA nanotechnology,
my lab's research is built upon three pillars: self-assembly complex DNA structures, DNA-directed assembly of
materials and devices, and most importantly, DNA nanodevices for biological and biomedical research and
applications. In recent years, I have published high-impact work in single-molecule mRNA detection, DNA-based
in vivo delivery of therapeutic small molecules and RNA for cancer treatment, and methods for ultra-sensitive
biosensing and bioimaging. In the next five years, I propose to develop novel, state-of-the-art DNA-based
molecular devices/probes for study of T cells and B cells, with special focus on the following directions: (1)
Multivalent DNA force probe nanoarrays for investigating multivalent binding, (2) Multiplexed DNA tension probes
for studying cross-regulation between mechanoreceptors, (3) DNA nanodevices to catch receptor conformation
change under force for Cryo-EM study. The proposed research is built upon our exciting progress on developing
novel DNA-based system for studying mechanobiology in recent years. Noticeably, we developed a DNA origami-
based system for programmable arrangement of TCR and CD4 for studying their cooperative binding, and I also
developed a few new methods to improve DNA tension sensors for mechanobiology study, including the first
DNA-origami-based multivalent tension sensors, super-resolution tension sensors that uses DNA PAINT, ultra-
sensitive tension sensors that employ a DNA-based hairpin chain reaction for signal amplification. My strong
expertise in DNA nanodevices, protein assembly on DNA nanostructures, DNA-based tension sensors, and my
track record of synergy and collaboration, place our lab at an excellent position for proposed research activities.
The tools developed herein are applicable to study of other molecular interactions of T cells and other cells in
the immune system or other biological systems, thereby potentially impacting the broader biomedicine field
where cell surface molecular interactions are being targeted for treatment of various diseases, including
autoimmunity, viral infection, and cancer."

10851021,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We previously reported (2) on the soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPPα)-enhancing effects of
tropisetron (F03). Highly brain-permeable F03 is approved in 49 countries for the treatment of post-operative
nausea and vomiting (PONV) and is a multifunctional ligand: it is a potent 5-HT3 serotonin receptor (5-HT3R)
antagonist (Ki ~ 3 nM), a partial α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) agonist (Ki ~ 450 nM), and binds
to the extracellular domain of amyloid precursor protein (eAPP). In our studies, we found F03 increases sAPPα
and also significantly decreases the phospho-tau (p-tau)/total tau (t-tau) ratio in two Alzheimer's disease (AD)
mouse models. We show that F03 can also reduce corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) induced p-tau/tau
increase in vitro. Hyperphosphorylation of tau leads to toxic tau oligomers and ultimately formation of
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in AD brain and is closely correlated with cognitive decline (34); thus, decreasing
tau phosphorylation is a critical target for new therapeutic approaches for AD and tauopathies. Based on reports
that sAPPα reduces the p-tau/t-tau ratio through suppression of activity of the kinase GSK3β (9), we plan to
assess the ability of our sAPPα enhancers to reduce the p-tau/t-tau ratio in vitro and in vivo. A key goal of the
project is to identify optimized small molecule sAPPα-enhancing, p-tau/t-tau lowering compounds that improve
cognition in murine AD models, for further development as a novel therapy for AD. An additional goal would be
to elucidate the underlying mechanism of action (MOA) of sAPPα enhancement and related reduction in the p-
tau/t-tau ratio. In Aim 1, we would test F03 and analogs we have in-hand as well as new analogs from Aim 2 in
SH-SY5Y cells and 3xTg-AD primary neurons to establish EC50s for sAPPα enhancement and p-tau/t-tau
decreases. Prioritized compounds would be evaluated for receptor binding and APP binding. Tertiary testing will
be in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from AD subjects and includes synaptic spine density
quantification. In Aim 2, medicinal chemistry would be used to design new chemical entity (NCE) analogs in a
iterative fashion with receptor and APP binding along with enhanced drug-like properties and oral brain
permeability. In Aim 3, ADME studies on analogs include solubility, microsomal stability, protein binding, parallel
artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) analysis, and in vivo pharmacokinetics (PK). Optimal
candidates would undergo safety (including hERG) and off-target panel profiling along with analyses of effect on
other kinases and of tau phosphorylation sites. In Aim 4 in vivo testing, including acute studies on select
candidates to evaluate effect on intracerebroventricular (ICV) delivered CRF induced p-tau/t-tau increases in
brain in 3xTg-AD mice. Active candidates would be tested in chronic 4-week efficacy studies in 3xTg-AD and
ApoE4-5XFAD AD model mice. Readouts would include behavioral and histopathology analysis, including
hippocampal neurite load and neuronal spine density. Biochemical outcomes include p-tau/t-tau ratio, sAPPα
and Aβ. Mechanistic studies by phosphoproteomics used for correlations between readouts and cognition."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infects 2 billion people worldwide, and kills more people every year than any
other single pathogen. Most people infected with Mtb are able to contain infection for their lifetimes, suggesting
the existence of immune mechanisms that can successfully control infection. Identifying these mechanisms is
crucial for the development of therapeutics that can bolster immunity in patients with insufficient immunity.
Macrophages serve the dual role as both the host cell for Mtb infection, and the cell that is primarily
responsible for controlling infection by activating microbicidal mechanisms that effectively kill bacteria. In
addition, macrophages influence the inflammatory response to infection by producing both pro-and anti-
inflammatory factors. The long-term goal of this project is to understand how macrophage metabolism
influences both antimicrobial activity and the regulation of inflammation. Our previous work centered around
activation of macrophages by IFN-γ, a cytokine that is critical for immune control of Mtb. We found that an
immuno-metabolic loop linking aerobic glycolysis, nitric oxide, and the transcription factor HIF-1α is crucial for
both antimicrobial control and regulating the balance of inflammation in macrophages infected ex vivo. In
addition, we demonstrated that HIF-1α in macrophages in essential for control of infection in mice. However, it
remains unclear whether the importance of HIF-1α and nitric oxide in vivo result from cell intrinsic control by
macrophages, regulation of inflammation, or both. Furthermore, recent data from several labs has suggested
that IFN-γ, while clearly important, may not be the only factor required for macrophage-based control of
infection in vivo. Indeed, several groups have reported that CD4 T cells can also mediate IFN-γ independent
control of infection in vivo. We have developed an ex vivo culture system that recapitulates CD4 T cell
dependent but IFN-γ independent control of infection, which provides a model system for mechanistic studies.
Intriguingly, our preliminary data suggest that macrophages activated by IFN-γ independent mechanisms
activate aerobic glycolysis and HIF-1α without producing NO. Finally, very little is known about how
macrophages support large scale changes in metabolism via regulated metabolite transport. Here we
proposed to further our understanding of both IFN-γ dependent and independent macrophage based control of
Mtb infection in three aims: 1) Determine the importance of NO/HIF-1α for cell intrinsic control of Mtb infection
in vivo 2) Demonstrate that IFN-γ independent control of Mtb infection requires aerobic glycolysis and HIF-1α
3) Demonstrate that solute carrier proteins play a role in regulating HIF-1α dependent control of infection by
supporting metabolite transport across cell membranes."

The proposed research will examine the efficacy of a videoconference-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy
(CBT), Memory and Attention Adaptation Training (MAAT), in a large, multi-site, randomized controlled trial
(RCT) for breast cancer survivors with chemotherapy-related cognitive dysfunction (CRCD). Outcome
measures include assessment of both subjective and objective cognitive functioning. Another goal of the
research is to use functional MRI (fMRI) to evaluate underlying changes in brain activation patterns that are
believed to be associated with positive effects of MAAT. Recent analyses by the MPIs have demonstrated
enhanced working memory-related cortical activation following MAAT treatment among individuals with
traumatic brain injury (TBI). The present work seeks to determine if the same activation patterns occur post-
treatment with MAAT vs. an attention control condition (supportive therapy; ST) in breast cancer survivors. If
successful, the results of this work will: (1) produce an evidence-based treatment that can be immediately
disseminated to cancer centers and other healthcare settings to treat CRCD and (2) help inform further
treatment development through improved understanding of mechanisms that promote CRCD recovery. MAAT
utilizes a non-drug, CBT approach to enhance self-management, behavioral adaptation, and coping with late
cognitive effects of chemotherapy. MAAT has been evaluated in four previous small trials: 1) a single-group
pilot study (NCI R03); 2) a randomized waitlist control trial (Lance Armstrong Foundation); 3) and a randomized
trial with an active control group condition (supportive therapy; ST) in which both MAAT and ST interventions
were delivered via videoconference (NCI R21). Research with breast cancer survivors shows promising results
with improved subjective and objective cognitive function. In a fourth trial, individuals with cognitive symptoms
after traumatic brain injury (TBI) showed improved cognitive function when treated with MAAT alone or in
combination with methylphenidate relative to those receiving behavioral or pill placebo. While research to date
is favorable, MAAT has not been evaluated in a large RCT with independent, multiple clinicians or at multiple
sites to establish efficacy and generalizability in the breast cancer population. Only one clinician has delivered
MAAT in previous breast cancer survivorship studies and the sample sizes were small. Therefore, the
proposed study makes important methodological improvements using a larger sample size in a multi-site,
multi-clinician RCT with an ST control condition, and reduces survivorship travel burden by delivering both
MAAT and ST over secured videoconference link. The proposed study therefore has the potential for great
clinical and scientific impact, and will help offer effective non-pharmacologic treatment that can be widely
disseminated using mobile technology, especially to rural survivors, to reduce travel and time burden and
improve survivorship care."

the underpinnings of such processes using electrophysiology, two-photon imaging, and optogenetics. The key
aim is to understand the role of neuronal dendrites in processing information during in vivo circuit activity.
Dendrites can fire regenerative electrical spikes much like axons, and this potentially provides a critical aspect
to information processing at the cellular level. How such an active mechanism is engaged and plays a functional
role in a behaving animal remains unclear. By directly recording intracellular electrical activity from fine distal
dendrites and their parent somas during sensory processing in vivo, along with two-photon imaging of calcium
dynamics at synaptic inputs and dendrites, we seek to understand how active dendritic mechanisms contribute
to synaptic integration, and how their modulation affects sensory integration. In this study, we will address the
following questions in vivo: 1) What is the relationship between dendritic synaptic inputs and dendritic spiking,
2) how effective are dendritic spikes in triggering axonal action potentials, and 3) what is the functional role of
dendritic spikes in sculpting the receptive field properties of neuronal output. Findings from the project will both
further our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of cellular information processing and provide a

negative (FN-RMS) that does not include the fusion event. Current treatments for FN-RMS remain poor and the
long-term event-free survival rate for FN-RMS metastatic patients is below 30%. TWIST2 transcription factor
represses myogenesis by inhibiting MyoD function and knockdown of TWIST2 in FN-RMS is shown to inhibit
tumor cell growth and enhance myogenic differentiation. To understand the mechanisms underlying TWIST2
function in FN-RMS, we sought to identify its direct transcriptional targets. Among them, we identified NT5E,
encoding an ecto 5’-nucleotidase, as a direct target gene of TWIST2. NT5E’s main role is to convert adenosine-
monophosphate to adenosine in the purinergic signaling pathway. NT5E has been shown to promote cancer
progression, invasion and metastasis in human melanoma and breast cancer. However, it’s possible role in FN-
RMS has not been explored. In this proposal, we hypothesize that NT5E contributes to FN-RMS tumor formation
and progression through the activation of the purinergic signaling pathway. To test this hypothesis, we will
investigate the contribution of NT5E expression to the pathogenesis of FN-RMS in vitro and in vivo. Then, we
will delineate the molecular mechanism whereby NT5E promotes FN-RMS. Completion of this research plan will
push the boundaries of our knowledge regarding the role of NT5E in FN-RMS pathogenesis with the ultimate
goal of developing novel therapeutic strategies for FN-RMS."
10833008,"There is a critical unmet need to identify the pathogenic mechanisms that drive disease progression in patients
with multiple sclerosis (MS). Accumulation of axon injury and functional disability in MS are not adequately
impacted by current therapies. The long-term goal of this work is to discover new strategies to prevent or
reverse disease progression in MS. Despite evidence that CD8+ T cells are associated with axon injury and
progression in MS, the functional role for these cells and the relevant mechanisms required for recruitment of
these cells to the demyelinated brain are unknown. The antigenic targets of neuron-specific CD8+ T cells are
also unknown. The overall objectives of this study are to test the mechanistic role of neuron antigen-specific
CD8+ T cells in the injury of demyelinated axons and to determine whether patients with MS have such cells.
The rationale is that axon injury is the primary substrate of progression in MS, axonal MHC class I expression
is upregulated by inflammation and demyelination, and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells directed against neuron-specific
antigens injure demyelinated axons. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that neuron antigen-specific
CD8+ T cells injure demyelinated axons. Guided by strong preliminary evidence, the hypothesis will be tested
using AAV-mediated transduction of neurons to drive expression of the neoantigen ovalbumin (OVA) within the
context of CNS demyelination induced by cuprizone toxicity or immunization against a myelin oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein-derived peptide (MOG-EAE) in hosts that have transgenic CD8+ T cells directed against the OVA-
derived peptide SIINFEKL (OT-I). The study will also use autologous T cells and fibroblast-derived iPSC-
derived neurons grown in microfluidic chambers to determine whether MS patient CD8+ T cells injure their own
axons. Three specific aims will be pursued: 1) determine the mechanisms of CD8+ T cell-mediated axon injury
in the demyelinated CNS; 2) identify the cellular locus of MHC class I expression required for axon injury and
determine how demyelination drives CNS infiltration of neuron antigen-specific CD8+ T cells; 3) determine
whether MS patients have neuron-antigen specific CD8+ T cells. This approach is conceptually innovative
because of the proposal that demyelination and inflammation induce axonal presentation of self-peptides on
MHC class I. The approach is technically innovative based on the use of novel AAV vectors to drive
neoantigens in neurons within the demyelinated CNS, selective deletion of brain-resident antigen presenting
cells (APCs) vs peripheral APCs, use of multiple host manipulations coupled to adoptive transfer of traceable
effector cells to temporally and spatially profile anti-neuronal T cell trafficking, and the use of patient-derived
neurons and autologous CD8+ T cells. This work will make a significant, powerful impact on the field by
revealing the capacity of CD8+ T cells directed against neuron-specific antigens to injure demyelinated axons
and by identifying such T cells in patients with MS."
10833217,"Abstract
Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) are a group of mucosal diseases in the oral cavity with a risk of
progressing to oral squamous cell carcinoma. Risk assessment is traditionally done through a combination of
clinical and histologic evaluation. Leukoplakia is a common type of OPMD that is given a histologic grading
score that is supposed to be related to its risk of progression. However, there is tremendous intra- and inter-
observer heterogeneity in dysplasia grading, leading to variability and uncertainty in risk assessment and
treatment planning. This also hinders the ability to study the biology of these lesions. We propose to use whole
slide imaging on routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections in combination with deep learning
methods to build a consistent risk scoring system for OPMD. Our methods will identify cell, nucleus, and tissue
architectural features relevant to risk of progression in OPMD. These features will be tested in a large
retrospective case-control study and then validated prospectively. We will also explore combining them with
genomic and immune biomarkers in order to improve the prognostic power and explore the biolo gy of
progression in OPMD. We hope that these efforts will improve and standardize risk assessment for OPMD.
This could lead to improved treatment and prevention options by enabling risk stratification and allowing future
clinical trials be conducted in a more uniform patient cohort. Similarly, it could improve our understanding for
the biology of OPMD and the process of progression to cancer."
10833572,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Inhalation exposures to diverse airborne toxicants are an ever-present, rising and ubiquitous public
health threat in our environments whether it be outdoor air pollution, industrial processes, or indoor
domestic or occupational toxicants. Inhalation exposures are widely associated with adverse health
outcomes in major physiological systems such as: pulmonary (asbestosis, black lung, silicosis);
cardiovascular (ischemia, infarction); neural (stroke, behavior), immune (inflammation); and
endocrine/reproductive (disruption, developmental origins of health and disease). The whole of West
Virginia is part of Appalachia, wherein significant health disparities such as
cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, depression and
addiction are disproportionately high. Further, poor socioeconomic status, and geography (thermal
inversions) trap communities in the immediate proximity of mountain-top mining (surface mining) and
hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) operations that produce tremendous amounts of industrial air pollution.
An immediate demand exists to train the next generation of scientists able to accurately assess the
complex interplay among these toxicological risks, and ultimately improve public health in West Virginia
and the nation. The Predoctoral Training in Systems Toxicology Program will formalize and
standardize our already strong training programs in the biomedical sciences and focus on inhalation
toxicology research. Several innovative aspects of this training program are semester-long didactic
courses in “Toxicology” and the “Inhalation & Aerosol Sciences”, a unique “Environmental Immersion”
in community outreach/engagement via air sampling downwind of mountaintop/surface mines and
fracking platforms, the “Paracelsus Society” colloquium and journal club, an Associate Scholars
Program and leadership training. This rigorous training program will select the best doctoral students
from the participating Biomedical Sciences Ph.D. and Clinical & Translational Sciences Ph.D. training
programs at the West Virginia University (WVU) Health Sciences Center (WVU HSC) and Engineering
and will prepare them with the skills, knowledge and acumen needed for a successful career in the
diverse field of toxicology. It is projected that up to 40 trainees will be enrolled in this program during
the funding period. The specific training for each mentee will be tailored based on their annually updated
Individualized Development Plan (IDP), and a “Career Options” Program will help prepare them for their
chosen career in diverse fields. Program training is expected to last 2-to-3 years. This pre-doctoral
training program will create a new generation of young scholars who can directly address the need for
innovative toxicology research for the citizens of West Virginia, Appalachia, and the nation."
10833575,"Project Summary
The goal of the proposed research is to understand the polymodal activation of TRPV1, specifically its activation
by heat, protons, and chemical ligands. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie TRPV1 function
has significant implications in human health. TRPV1 is a polymodally regulated ion channel that is activated by
many diverse stimuli, including heat, protons (low pH), and chemical ligands, like capsaicin, the pungent vanilloid
from chili peppers. Over the past decade, there has been significant interest in developing TRPV1 antagonists
to combat many types of pain and other relevant indications. One of the main complications in TRPV1 therapeutic
intervention is that antagonists commonly dysregulate body temperature. Recent computational modeling and
meta-analysis of human clinical trials suggest which modes of TRPV1 should be targeted for the development
of analgesic antagonists that mitigate off-target effects. This proposal aims to dissect the independence,
interdependence, and crosstalk between canonical TRPV1 activation modes and decipher the respective
mechanisms. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and electrophysiology techniques will be used
to achieve these goals. These data will be used to understand which TRPV1 regions underlie particular functions
and illuminate allostery, cooperativity, and crosstalk between activation modes. To achieve these goals, two
specific aims will be carried out. Aim 1 will focus on the characterization of a minimal TRPV1 construct inspired
from natural TRPV1-isoforms that recapitulates the features of the full-length channel with electrophysiology and
NMR studies. Additionally, this aim will provide the first structures of a human TRPV1 domain. A membrane
domain that is responsible for ligand binding and involved in thermosensing. The structural studies will access
non-cryogenic temperatures giving rise to information about the mechanism of thermosensing. These
mechanistic and structural studies will be validated and contextualized with cellular studies. Aim 2 will focus on
dissecting the allostery and crosstalk between TRPV1 heat, proton, and ligand modes of activation. One series
of experiments will rely on validating computational predictions of human TRPV1 allosteric networks with whole-
cell patch-clamp measurements. Another set of experiments will leverage chemical ligands from preclinical
experiments and clinical trials that will be used with mutagenesis to identify ligand binding sites and how TRPV1
mode selectivity is achieved. The last sub-aim will employ an NMR-detected ligand screen of TRPV1 agonists
and antagonists which will be subjected to emerging statistical analysis and learning techniques to generate
methodologies capable of predicting which modes of activity TRPV1 modulators will activate. Significant
preliminary electrophysiology and NMR data coupled with computational analysis indicate the feasibility of these
aims during the timeframe of this proposal. The proposed biophysical and functional TRPV1 studies aim to better
understand the molecular mechanisms that govern the function and complicate druggability and are anticipated
to guide the development of the next generation of TRPV1 antagonists."
10833700,"Project Summary / Abstract
Problems in scientific practice have generated widespread concern about the reliability of
findings in behavioral and social science research (BSSR), including work related to aging.
These problems arise from a lack of transparency on the part of researchers, as well as
incentives in publishing and academia that encourage the presentation of results in ways that
are newsworthy, but not necessarily reproducible or rigorous. Training on transparency and
reproducibility is critical for equipping the BSSR workforce to conduct credible research. But
while it is becoming more widely available, it is not yet the norm in graduate curricula.
Led by the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS), the Research
Transparency and Reproducibility Training (RT2) is designed to strengthen the integrity of
BSSR by increasing awareness of problems driven by opacity and providing exposure to and
practice with tools designed to improve openness. In addition to providing an overview of
problems and solutions in transparency, RT2 will provide space for practice with open science
tools, as well as feedback on ongoing work in which participants are applying openness
practices.
BITSS has developed curricular materials for and delivered seven RT2 events and dozens of
related workshops since 2014. This project will first adapt these for application in BSSR focused
on aging topics, and integrating applied and discourse-based approaches to improve their
effectiveness. This curriculum will be delivered through annual short courses for graduate
students, postdocs, and other junior researchers. We will further facilitate long-term adoption of
technical and transferable skills by investing in “‘champions” who provide support to peers and
collaborators. We will provide access to funding and other guidance to help them integrate new
practices into their research and teaching activities. Finally, we will evaluate the effectiveness of
RT2 and its impact on learners through pre- and post-training surveys and in-depth interviews
with randomly selected participants.
Feedback from previous participants and applicants have demonstrated RT2’s effectiveness, as
well as growing demand for training of this kind. In broadening its methodological focus and
integrating applied and discursive approaches, RT2 can further transform research culture,
equipping participants to lead, teach, and collaborate on transparent and reproducible aging
research, laying the groundwork for better informing the decisions of policymakers, practitioners,
and the public, and for facilitating collaboration and equity in BSSR."
10929552,"Project Summary
Xylazine is an emerging serious threat to people who inject drugs (PWID). Xylazine and fentanyl drug mixtures
elevate risk overdose and because xylazine is not an opioid, naloxone does not reverse its effects. Despite the
increasing presence of xylazine in overdose deaths across the US, there is limited epidemiologic research
focused on characterizing the prevalence and risk factors of its use in settings where mortality data indicates a
known elevated risk. Although there has been a marked uptick of severe wounds and necrosis among those
using drugs that contain xylazine, the specific drug use practices or other characteristics related to the
development of wounds are not known. The goal of this research is to generate urgently needed evidence to
understand the prevalence, risk factors, knowledge, and harm reduction practices associated with xylazine use
and the development of wounds among PWID, in order to effectively inform practice and raise awareness
among the affected communities, health care and harm reduction service providers and the public regarding
the health risks associated with xylazine. We propose a mixed methods approach using respondent-driven
sampling to identify and survey approximately n=300 PWID in Baltimore and n=40 qualitative interviews with
those who use xylazine, health care and harm reduction providers. We will estimate the prevalence and
correlates of both intentional and suspected xylazine use and examine xylazine-specific overdose knowledge,
beliefs and practices. We will determine the prevalence of wounds associated with xylazine use and the
association between HIV infection, drug use practices and wounds. We will also characterize barriers to
accessing wound care using qualitative methods. This research on a sudden emerging illicit drug will generate
time-sensitive knowledge that will directly contribute to preventing the harmful consequences associated with
xylazine emergence. We will translate our findings and conduct broad dissemination, working with local
stakeholders, partner organizations, and governmental agencies to inform overdose and treatment programs."

10837782,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adolescence is a high-risk developmental period for the first onset of depression, and epidemiological research
reveals a sharp increase in incidence rates for depressive disorders during this time. Considering earlier
onsets of depression are associated with a more debilitating course of the disorder throughout the lifespan, the
identification of vulnerability factors is critical for early and personalized intervention. Depression is
characterized by widespread alterations in emotion processing, and difficulties regulating responses to
dysphoric, sad emotions are thought to be central to the onset and maintenance of depression. Given
compelling evidence that some alterations in emotion processing precede the development of depression,
neurophysiological markers of dysregulated responses to dysphoric stimuli could potentially identify those at
greatest risk for recurrence and new depressive episodes. Previous research demonstrates event-related
potentials (ERPs) derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG) reliably and economically capture the
temporal dynamics of emotion processing. Further, studies on emotion regulation demonstrate EEG markers in
both the time and frequency domains are modifiable by regulation efforts, such as cognitive reappraisal.
Despite this promise, complex emotion regulation tasks with extended stimuli presentations result in high-
dimensional data, amplifying ambiguities and discrepancies in quantifying ERPs relevant to the emergence
and maintenance of depression. One established solution is to use principal components analysis (PCA) to
reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify task-relevant ERPs. Yet, translational research examining
associations between ERPs to emotion and depression is further limited by issues of replicability and clinical
relevance. The primary goal of the proposed research is to compare classification algorithms to clarify the
neurophysiological substrates of emotion regulation that optimize diagnostic and prognostic predictions of
adolescent (age 14-17) depression in order to facilitate early, personalized intervention and prevention efforts.
Aim 1: Examine within-subjects effects of emotion regulation on ERP and time-frequency EEG components.
Aim 2: Iteratively investigate which neurophysiological emotion regulation features and classification algorithms
most accurately classify adolescents with and without current depression at baseline. Aim 3: Identify which
emotion regulation features and classification algorithms most accurately predict future onsets of depressive
episodes in adolescents. Exploratory analyses will examine potential sex differences and compare model
performance when including self-reports of emotion regulation. In addition to these research goals, this award
will support my predoctoral training goals to expand my developing expertise in diagnostic clinical interviewing,
conceptual understanding of emotion regulation, advanced EEG/ERP methods, and rigorous quantitative
techniques, preparing me for a career as a successful translational clinical researcher."

The University of Mississippi proposes to establish the Glycoscience Center of Research Excellence
(GlyCORE), a Phase I Center of Biomedical Research Excellence. Glycoscience is an essential and rapidly
emerging field of biomedical science, and the challenging nature of glycoscience research requires tools and
expertise that are not commonly found in the biomedical research community. The Administrative Core of
GlyCORE will play a pivotal role in helping GlyCORE meet its core goal of developing a competitive, self-
sustaining center of excellence in glycoscience through junior faculty development, research infrastructure
development, and outreach to the regional community of investigators with interests in glycoscience. The
Administrative Core will provide strategic planning and oversight of Research Core and funded investigator
activity through a three component system, consisting of: GlyCORE Principal Investigators to handle day-to-
day administration; an Internal Advisory Committee made of University of Mississippi experts knowledgeable in
both the science and administration issues involved in forming a large research center; and an External
Advisory Committee consisting of five members accomplished in diverse fields across glycoscience. These
committees will administer awards for two research support programs through a process designed to prepare
investigators for NIH peer review: a Junior Investigator (JI) program that will fund four concurrent three-year JI
projects at $175,000 per year; and a Pilot Project Program that funds four new two year projects at $50,000
each per year. JIs and JI candidates will also participate in a professional development program for that
includes partnering with experienced mentors in the field; formative evaluations to help guide JI development
and the generation of milestones; and summative evaluations to evaluate performance and progress towards
independent investigator status. The Administrative Core will also lead a campus-wide Faculty Recruitment
Program to recruit new faculty in glycoscience, including the hire of a mid-career carbohydrate synthetic
chemist to grow our institutional capacity for mentorship and collaboration. Finally, the Administrative Core will
develop internal meetings to promote interaction between GlyCORE investigators and campus visibility of
glycoscience, as well as an annual regional Mid-South Glycoscience Symposium to help bring together
glycoscience investigators, disseminate Research Core capabilities to regional investigators, and introduce the
University of Mississippi as a center for glycoscience research excellence. Working with the IAC, EAC, and the
University of Mississippi Center for Research Evaluation, the Administrative Core will evaluate the
effectiveness of these programs in developing junior faculty and increasing the visibility and reputation of
glycoscience at the University of Mississippi. These activities, combined with ancillary activities to support
GlyCORE investigator travel, grant proposal preparation and submission, and professional development, will

The University of Mississippi proposes to establish the Glycoscience Center of Research Excellence
(GlyCORE), a Phase I Center of Biomedical Research Excellence. Glycoscience is an essential and rapidly
emerging field of biomedical science, and the challenging nature of glycoscience research requires tools and
expertise that are not commonly found in the biomedical research community. Moreover, the biomedical
community is rapidly growing to appreciate the essential role of carbohydrates, with researchers outside of the
self-identified “glycoscience” community finding themselves faced with addressing challenging questions in
glycoscience as part of the course of their biomedical researchers. The focus of the Analytical and Biophysical
Research Core is three-fold: to train investigators new to glycoscience in proper carbohydrate sample
preparation and handling; to support hypothesis-driven research with targeted quantitative analyses from
both enriched samples and complex mixtures; and to support discovery-based research to give investigators
a system-level view of changes upon perturbation of targeted systems. Training of researchers is a key
function of the Core, especially in Phase I when the institutional level of expertise in glycoscience is in its
earliest stage of development. Core 1 will train researchers in carbohydrate and carbohydrate conjugate
sample preparation techniques. Targeted analyses will be provided as a key technology for hypothesis-driven
research, where an investigator wants to test for the presence and quantity of a given glycan or glycoside,
structurally characterize an unknown molecule, or validate a key biological or chemical resource. Structural
analyses of glycan modification, protein-carbohydrate interactions, binding affinity estimations, and other
biophysical analyses will be supported through MS-, LC- and spectrophotometry-based technologies. Access
to NMR instrumentation and expertise in spectral acquisition and interpretation will also be provided. Finally,
Core 1 will offer “omics”-style discovery-based surveys of glycomes, proteomes, metabolomes, etc. in
quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative fashions, supporting systems glycobiology and hypothesis
development for targeted assay design. Core 1 will interface closely with the Computational Chemistry and
Bioinformatics Core to provide advanced statistical and pathway analyses for “omics” data. The services of
Core 1 will use both existing University of Mississippi resources as well as a dedicated high resolution Thermo
Q-Exactive Plus LC-MS/MS system and a Dionex Ultimate 3000 analytical UHPLC system. Due to the poor
UV-absorption characteristics of most carbohydrates, fluorescence detection for tagged carbohydrates and
charged aerosol detection of underivatized carbohydrates will also be available for sensitive detection and
quantitation at high dynamic range. By focusing our Phase I Analytical and Biophysical Core on a small
number of flexible technologies, we can support the diverse glycoscience interests of UM investigators with
cutting-edge technology using a limited array of equipment and have room for growth as GlyCORE matures."
10838585,"There is an unequivocal need to develop and employ advanced techniques in microscopy toward
understanding the cellular functions of glycans. Glycans participate in many cellular properties, including cell
structure, cell-cell recognition, protein trafficking, and protein-protein interaction. Hence, changes in glycan

health. Advanced imaging techniques are becoming a vital part of an integrative approach to understanding
the roles of glycans in health and disease. These techniques provide insights into molecular composition,
while preserving the spatial context of the chemical, structural, and physiological responses to changes in
glycans. Recent advances in identify lectin specificities and the availability of a broad range of fluorescently
labeled and biotinylated lectins has rapidly advanced our ability to identify changes in the location and
abundance of specific glycans in cells and tissues. Moreover, several powerful approaches in confocal
microscopy, including FRET, FRAP, and FLIP, permit highly sensitive measures of molecular dynamics within
living cells. These measures will help researchers understand the fundamental effect glycans have on cellular
function. The central goal of this proposal is to bring the ability to employ advanced imaging techniques to the
GlyCORE investigators in their diverse research programs and to help develop new approaches in the cell
biology of glycans. These goals will be accomplished in three aims: 1) establish an imaging core that contains
three different imaging platforms, including a powerful new confocal microscope; 2) support the GlyCORE
investigators in their individual projects by working to develop new imaging applications; and 3) develop an
extensive training program to develop expertise and awareness of new methods in imaging and image
analysis. This proposal will transform research in the glycosciences at the University of Mississippi by
providing access to advanced instrumentation and expertise and training in the use of these imaging systems."

give key complementary data to experimental work in order to speed significant progress in modern
glycoscience. Such research can help ameliorate the human health condition in myriad ways. The objective of
this proposal is to establish and operate the GlyCORE Computational core that will help sustain and grow
successful GlyCORE projects at the University of Mississippi. The core will be highly functional and actually carry
out much of the needed research calculations for collaborative projects. The topmost priority will be to interface
with the Junior Investigators (JI) and all other personnel of the GlyCORE project. There are several categories
of calculations that will be useful for the existing JI Projects and Pilot Projects. Core 3 will be effectively focused
to make its capabilities known to participants and potential participants in the program, through meetings with
the personnel, specific training sessions, a web interface, and other outreach methods organized by GlyCORE.
Core 3 will also work closely with Core 1: Analytical and Biophysical Chemistry Research and Core 2: Imaging
Research, including specifically for analysis of LC-MS/MS data for better understanding of key biochemical
pathways. The work of Core 3 is categorized under four specific aims. Aim 1: Support Junior Investigators, Pilot
Project Program Investigators and other glycoscience researchers in identifying computational approaches that
can assist them in their projects. Aim 2: Provide training in computational methods for glycoscience. Core 3 will
organize training sessions to assist researchers who are interested to understand how and what computational
approaches can be useful for their projects and, if they see it as a priority, to teach them how to do their own
computations to accomplish their research goals and to build their own skill portfolio. Aim 3: Carry out a wide
range of computational chemistry and bioinformatics calculations for glycoscience. Aim 4: Develop and provide
a cooperative pipeline to generate, analyze and interpret high-throughput LC-MS/MS data for proteomics,
glycomics, and metabolomics."

HIV Pharmacology Data Repository (HIV PDR)
Clinical pharmacology is paramount to developing new therapeutic strategies for HIV treatment, prevention, and
cure that are needed to end the epidemic. Since its inception in 2001, the UNC Center for AIDS Research
(CFAR) Clinical Pharmacology and Analytical Chemistry (CPAC) Core has led the field in the provision of high-
quality clinical pharmacology services to HIV/AIDS researchers. The CPAC Core has consolidated >75,000
unique concentration vs time (CvT) datapoints resulting from >29,000 samples collected across 482 unique
studies quantifying 72 drug molecules in 10 species and 14 anatomical compartments into a single searchable
data portal - the HIV Pharmacology Data Repository (HIV PDR). Pooled CvT data can be easily extracted
from the HIV PDR in machine readable output, making this data portal a valuable informatic tool for sharing and
exploring antiretroviral pharmacokinetic data to accelerate biomedical research discovery. We seek to maximize
the HIV PDR’s scientific impact by expanding and disseminating this resource through the following aims: 1)
creating new tools to catalyze data expansion, 2) demonstrating utility by promoting scientific exploration, and
3) propagating use by engaging users and characterizing their Target Product Profile (TPP). To this end we
propose to apply FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles to expand CvT data archives,
promote exploration, and empirically inform downstream development of the HIV PDR. We will ensure the long-
term sustainability of this valuable resource by creating advisory boards to oversee the development of a robust
governance plan designed to ensure regulatory compliance while meeting user needs. Finally, in performing the
proposed aims, we will pioneer a data-sharing service to assist HIV/AIDS researchers in meeting the
recommendations provided within the 2023 NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing."
10838815,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-1 persists in memory CD4+ T cells as the major barrier to cure.
ART inhibits viral enzyme function but does not kill infected cells. Around 12 million HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells
establish the HIV-1 reservoir. HIV-1-infected cells survive viral cytopathic effects, evade cytotoxic CD8+ T cell
killing, and persist over time. What is even worse, these HIV-1-infected cells proliferate: more than 50% of the
HIV-1 reservoir undergo clonal expansion through antigen stimulation, homeostatic cytokine stimulation, or HIV-
1 integration site-driven proliferation. Understanding mechanisms of the clonal expansion of HIV-1-infected cells
is a top priority to stop the proliferation of HIV-1-infected cells and guide the design of HIV-1 cure. However,
understanding HIV-1 persistence in people living with HIV-1 is extremely challenging. First, CD4+ T cells are
highly heterogeneous, having different T cell polarization (such as Th1, Th2, Th17, and T reg), memory
differentiation (such as naïve, central memory, effector memory, and effector), activation states, exhaustion
states, proliferation capacity, and antigen specificity. Second, HIV-1-infected cells harboring inducible HIV-1 are
extremely rare in HIV-1-infected individuals, accounting for ~1–100/million CD4+ T cells (<0.01%) in the
peripheral blood. Third, there is no cellular marker that can precisely identify HIV-1-infected cells for single-cell
profiling. We recently used a cutting-edge single-cell multi-omic profiling method called ECCITEseq to decipher
the heterogeneity of immune cell types and capture the rare HIV-1-infected cells. This single-cell multi-omic
method allows us to capture single-cell transcriptome at the genome-wide level, profile more than 100 cellular
protein markers, detect HIV-1 RNA+ cells, and capture T cell proliferation dynamics by T cell receptor (TCR)
sequencing, all within the same single cell. This allows us to determine immune programs, clonal expansion
dynamics, and cell markers for HIV-1 RNA+ cells for high-dimensional, multi-omic, and genome-wide
understanding of HIV-1 persistence without ex vivo stimulation. Using advanced single-cell multi-omic approach,
we tracked the clonally expanding CD4+ T cells between different anatomical locations in the body. In addition,
we identified a pro-survival cellular factor that is upregulated in HIV-1-infected cells and may promote the

compartments and persist under cytokine cues in the tissue compartment. We further hypothesize that HIV-1-
infected cells can resist viral cytopathic effect by upregulating this pro-survival cellular factor. Our goal is to track
the clonal expansion dynamics of HIV-1+ cells over space and time (Aim 1) and decipher how HIV-1-infected
cells survive viral cytopathic effect and proliferate (Aim 2). Overall, we will provide an unprecedented
understanding of HIV-1 reservoir regarding mechanisms of HIV-1 persistence and clonal expansion dynamics of

11100478,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-1 persists in memory CD4+ T cells as the major barrier to cure.
ART inhibits viral enzyme function but does not kill infected cells. Around 12 million HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells
establish the HIV-1 reservoir. HIV-1-infected cells survive viral cytopathic effects, evade cytotoxic CD8+ T cell
killing, and persist over time. What is even worse, these HIV-1-infected cells proliferate: more than 50% of the
HIV-1 reservoir undergo clonal expansion through antigen stimulation, homeostatic cytokine stimulation, or HIV-
1 integration site-driven proliferation. Understanding mechanisms of the clonal expansion of HIV-1-infected cells
is a top priority to stop the proliferation of HIV-1-infected cells and guide the design of HIV-1 cure. However,
understanding HIV-1 persistence in people living with HIV-1 is extremely challenging. First, CD4+ T cells are
highly heterogeneous, having different T cell polarization (such as Th1, Th2, Th17, and T reg), memory
differentiation (such as naïve, central memory, effector memory, and effector), activation states, exhaustion
states, proliferation capacity, and antigen specificity. Second, HIV-1-infected cells harboring inducible HIV-1 are
extremely rare in HIV-1-infected individuals, accounting for ~1–100/million CD4+ T cells (<0.01%) in the
peripheral blood. Third, there is no cellular marker that can precisely identify HIV-1-infected cells for single-cell
profiling. We recently used a cutting-edge single-cell multi-omic profiling method called ECCITEseq to decipher
the heterogeneity of immune cell types and capture the rare HIV-1-infected cells. This single-cell multi-omic
method allows us to capture single-cell transcriptome at the genome-wide level, profile more than 100 cellular
protein markers, detect HIV-1 RNA+ cells, and capture T cell proliferation dynamics by T cell receptor (TCR)
sequencing, all within the same single cell. This allows us to determine immune programs, clonal expansion
dynamics, and cell markers for HIV-1 RNA+ cells for high-dimensional, multi-omic, and genome-wide
understanding of HIV-1 persistence without ex vivo stimulation. Using advanced single-cell multi-omic approach,
we tracked the clonally expanding CD4+ T cells between different anatomical locations in the body. In addition,
we identified a pro-survival cellular factor that is upregulated in HIV-1-infected cells and may promote the
proliferation of HIV-1-infecte cells. We hypothesize that HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells traffic to different tissue
compartments and persist under cytokine cues in the tissue compartment. We further hypothesize that HIV-1-
infected cells can resist viral cytopathic effect by upregulating this pro-survival cellular factor. Our goal is to track
the clonal expansion dynamics of HIV-1+ cells over space and time (Aim 1) and decipher how HIV-1-infected
cells survive viral cytopathic effect and proliferate (Aim 2). Overall, we will provide an unprecedented
understanding of HIV-1 reservoir regarding mechanisms of HIV-1 persistence and clonal expansion dynamics of
HIV-1-infected cells at the single cell level. We will identify therapeutic targets and guide HIV-1 eradication
strategies."

Candidate: Dr. Lisandra Via Ellis is a physician with extensive training in vascular biology and lung development.
She is a postdoctoral fellow at MD Anderson Cancer Center seeking to understand how blood vessels develop
in the lung and how this process is affected in disease. She just published her first, first-author paper in
Developmental Cell.
Career development: Dr. Vila Ellis' mentors include Dr. Jichao Chen, a successful scientist who studies
developmental biology in the mouse lung, and Dr. Burton Dickey, a physician who has over 30 years of research
experience in the lung. Additionally, Dr. Vila Ellis will have the support of many collaborators in the field, as well
as a mentoring committee to ensure she meets the expected milestones of this proposal, and guarantee a
smooth transition to an independent career.
Research: Dr. Vila Ellis' work has shown that Vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) specifies a novel
population of endothelial cells in the lung. These cells are transcriptionally and morphologically distinct, and in
their absence the alveolar space is aberrantly enlarged, reminiscent of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In the
future, Dr. Vila Ellis will study how this specification process happens and what role these new cells play in lung
disease.
In summary, this proposal will address the mechanisms of pulmonary endothelial cell heterogeneity and help
establish the lung endothelium as a key component in the origin of developmental diseases."
10848831,"Drexel University proposes to establish a robust and innovative program, Drexel DREAM (Diversity, Research,
Experiential Learning, Research Skills and Aging Science, and Mentorship) Scholars Program, to enhance the
diversity of the biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research workforce in aging research. This proposal, a
collaboration across Drexel, is led by the College of Nursing and Health Professions and College of Medicine
and leverages the expertise of nationally and internationally recognized faculty researchers across Drexel who
are members of the Cell2Society Aging Research Network (Cell2Society), a Drexel Area of Research
Excellence, and are committed to diversifying and training the future workforce in aging research. The DREAM
Scholars program is built upon 5 pillars: 1) the university’s commitment to diversity in students, faculty, and
staff, and health equity in the communities we serve; 2) faculty expertise in aging research approaches that
span the continuum from the bench to policy in three key thematic areas: preventing and managing chronic
conditions, enhancing active and purposeful living, and enabling aging in place; 3) experiential learning; 4) an
innovative virtual learning community (VLC) where students obtain digital badges for mastering new knowledge
in research skills and aging science; and 5) faculty mentorship for each DREAM Scholar throughout their
undergraduate studies. The overall goal of the DREAM Scholars Program is to expose undergraduate
underrepresented minority (URM) students to research in aging that spans from the cell to society and in the
long-term increase the biomedical workforce. We will recruit and train 22 URM students who completed
freshman year to participate in the DREAM Summer track- a noncredit full-time 10-week paid summer aging
research training program and 38 URM students in their sophomore, pre-junior, or junior year, to participate in
the DREAM CO-OP Scholar Track- a noncredit full-time 26-week paid aging research training program as their
cooperative education rotation. DREAM Scholars will be paired with a Cell2Society faculty mentor to conduct
research, participate in a VLC where they will learn research skills and aging science, recognize health equity
issues in aging, be mentored to enhance professional and personal growth, and receive digital badges upon
completion of activities related to reframing aging, responsible conduct of research, aging science, research
skills, and diversity. The specific aims are 1) evaluate the effectiveness of the DREAM Scholars program in
shaping career goals with an awareness of research into aging, 2) evaluate the effectiveness of the DREAM
Scholars program in developing research skills for undergraduate URM students, 3) foster an awareness of
health equity in aging research, and 4) evaluate the DREAM Scholar program implementation processes."
10852918,"Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) increases the risk for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, adversely affecting
physical, cognitive, motor, and neurodevelopmental delay. In a pilot study (N=318) conducted by our U.S.-Rusian
team at the Irkutsk Regional Maternity Hospital (RMH), 59% of women tested positive for alcohol consumption
as assessed by a laboratory-confirmed alcohol biomarker (PEth). The proposed study will adapt an effective
alcohol reduction intervention evaluated in Russia among non-pregnant alcohol-using women to optimize its
efficacy for alcohol-using women in prenatal care. We propose to implement a randomized controlled trial
(N=720) to assess the efficacy of the alcohol reduction intervention, relative to standard-of-care, in (1) reducing
alcohol consumption among pregnant women in prenatal care, 2) reducing poor birth outcomes, and 3) reducing
infants’ alcohol-related physical and facial characteristics, and cognitive, motor and neurodevelopmental
outcomes. We will recruit women at their first prenatal visit to the Irkutsk RMH. Eligible women (1) are >18 years;
(2) provide informed consent; (3) have a positive rapid point-of-care urine test for recent alcohol use; and (4) ≤8
weeks gestation complete a baseline assessment. Women are randomized to one of two conditions: the
intervention condition, which includes standard-of-care plus the alcohol reduction intervention, or the comparison
condition, which provides standard-of-care only. In the alcohol reduction intervention, participants receive: (1) a
computer-delivered component to enhance knowledge, norms, and motivation for alcohol reduction, and (2) a
brief obstetrician-delivered component reinforcing the computer-delivered content. The alcohol reduction
intervention is theory-driven and uses motivational enhancement strategies to promote alcohol reduction. The
alcohol reduction intervention is delivered to women on three occasions, following their baseline, 2nd-trimester,
and 3rd-trimester assessments. Women in the comparison condition complete assessments on the same
schedule. To assess infant birth outcomes, we will abstract medical records shortly after delivery. To assess
physical and facial characteristics and cognitive, motor, and neurodevelopmental outcomes, all mothers return
with their infants to complete 6- and 12-month infant assessments. An intent-to-treat analysis evaluates the
efficacy of the intervention condition relative to the comparison condition in enhancing the proportion of women
detected with a laboratory-confirmed negative PEth test. Other analyses assess intervention effects on birth
outcomes, infant physical and facial characteristics, and cognitive, motor, and developmental outcomes at 6-
and 12-months. The proposed research is scientifically and clinically significant. If demonstrated effective, the
intervention may represent a scalable alcohol reduction strategy for prenatal care in other maternity hospitals in
Russia and elsewhere to reduce prenatal alcohol exposure and alcohol-related birth and infant developmental
outcomes. If successful, this would be the first prevention intervention conducted as part of CIFASD."
10853048,"Project Summary/Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with a global prevalence close to 50 million
people, which is expected to double by 2040. Finding an effective treatment for AD has proven difficult, as
evidenced by numerous high profile Phase 3 clinical trial failures, most of which directly target the reduction of
ß-amyloid. Thus, it is becoming increasingly urgent to develop new pharmacological strategies to combat AD.
Drugs are twice as likely to successfully negotiate the drug development pipeline and obtain FDA approval when
their targets are supported from human genetic studies of disease. Human genetic studies have revealed a
critical role for microglia involvement in Alzheimer’s disease progression, and it has recently been discovered
that the transcription factor PU.1 is a driver of the pro-neurodegenerative phenotype adopted by microglia during
aging and disease. This proposal therefore aims to develop novel, newly-discovered PU.1 Inhibitory Modulators
(PIMs) for preclinical development, with the long term goal of clinically testing the hypothesis that reducing PU.1
activity in microglia will safely delay the age of AD onset (AAO) in at-risk populations.
The studies in this proposal leverage the interdisciplinary structure of the Neurodegeneration Consortium, a
unique collaboration between basic science researchers and industry drug development veterans operating
under a collaborative agreement to push forward novel therapeutics aimed at treating Alzheimer’s diseaes and
other neurodegenerative diseases. Under Specific Aim 1, the in vivo safety and efficacy of PIMs will be
determined in mouse models of AD. Under Specific Aim 2, parallel target engagement studies will be performed
to identify the target of PIMs, and the identified targets will be used to develop assays to determine the efficacy
of PIMs in AD and in ex vivo models. Under Specific Aim 3, selected PIMs will be optimized using PK/PD and
ADMET screening to develop lead tool compounds into candidate compounds suitable for future Phase I studies.
The combined biology, chemistry, and pharmacology expertise in the Neurodegeneration Consortium, spanning
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the Massachussets Institute of Technology, and the Mt.
Sinai School of Medicine, make this group of researchers ideally suited to execute the proposed aims."

The overall goal of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is to support
the candidate, Dr. Wen Liu, in developing an independent clinical program of research to optimize mealtime
care quality, function, and nutrition in aging and ADRD population. Her long-term career goal is to become an
independent investigator and national leader conducting patient-centered, interdisciplinary clinical research to
optimize mealtime care and patient outcomes across a broad range of care settings. Dr. Liu’s three training
goals are: 1) Behavioral intervention science to develop knowledge and skills on the development, delivery,
evaluation, and refinement of behavioral interventions for dementia mealtime care in clinical care settings; 2)
Advanced methodologies in clinical trials to develop knowledge and skills in a) design and conduct of
clinical trials, and b) the use of qualitative and mixed methods to inform feasibility of the intervention and guide
refinement of the intervention; and 3) Advanced quantitative statistical methods to analyze large clustered
data coded from video-taped mealtime observations that are collected from behavioral clinical trials. Under the
mentorship of an accomplished team of investigators, Dr. Liu will achieve the training goals through completion
of systematically planned formal and informal training activities at the University of Iowa, a research-intensive
organization with significant and long-standing resources for early career investigators. The training plan will
provide her with knowledge and skills necessary to address two significant and intertwined dementia mealtime
care problems - mealtime difficulties and insufficient intake - both requiring immediate and joint resolution.
Emerging evidence supports the negative association of full assistance provision and the positive association
of person-centered care with resident mealtime difficulties and intake. Current interventions are lacking on the
use of person-centered care strategies, and fail to address care providers’ needs for knowledge and skills to
provide optimal mealtime care. To address this gap, the proposed research aims to complete the development
and pilot testing of a theory-based, person-centered mealtime care intervention, Optimizing Mealtime Care
(OPTIMAL), to effectively engage residents in eating and maintain their highest level of function possible. The
three specific aims are: 1) Develop, evaluate, and refine the OPTIMAL intervention protocol and training
materials; 2) Determine feasibility, fidelity, and usefulness of OPTIMAL; and 3) Describe resident
outcomes. This study will use a mixed methods approach integrating focus group interviews and a pilot two-
group parallel cluster RCT. Data obtained will be used to further refine the OPTIMAL intervention protocol and
study procedures, as well as to estimate effect sizes for a future larger trial. Dr. Liu will develop and submit an
R01 application to evaluate the efficacy of the refined OPTIMAL by middle of Year 4. This study is a critical first
step to achieve Dr. Liu’s long-term career goal, and complements the NIA strategic focus to support and
conduct behavioral research to improve health, well-being, and function in the aging and ADRD population.
Project Summary/Abstract - Administrative Supplement
The PI has experienced a critical life event during the award period, which along with pandemic-related delays
and challenges has impacted the progress of the funded project and increased the needs for more time and
personnel support for the completion of the remaining study activities of the funded project. The administrative
supplement is critical to provide 1-year personnel support for a full-time research support coordinator and
research assistants in the team. The support will be critical to ensure the continuity of the research project and
collaboration of the currently established research team who have been well trained with study procedures,
have a good understanding of the data collected and procedures to complete remaining activities, and have
been working collaboratively with the PI in the previous year.
The administrative supplement will be used to support the research team members to complete the following
activities which are within the scope of the funded project:
 1. Ongoing research activities in Aim 2 and Aim 3 including data coding, cleaning, entry, and
 management; development of multi-level data structure/datasets, and data analysis.
 2. dissemination of results through manuscripts, presentations, stakeholder/community engagement
 activities, and other sources
 3. preparation and submission of a large R-series grant application to NIH/NIA.
Support from the administrative supplement will greatly ensure the successful completion of the remaining
activities of the funded project. Completion of these research activities will support the continuity of the PI (Dr.
Wen Liu)’s program of research in dissemination of person-centered care to optimize mealtime care and
outcomes in ADRD, support the PI to return to full productivity at the end of the supplement period, and
facilitate PI’s transition from mentored career development award to research independence."
10850137,"The overarching goal of this R16 SuRE project is to optimize the validity of the Multidimensional Assessment of
Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) for evaluating mind-body interventions. Interoception is defined as one's
ability to adaptively interpret and respond to signals from within the body. Many interoceptive responses are
autonomically driven; others are within the realm of subjective experience. The subjective facet is termed
`interoceptive sensibility' which is measured using self-report questionnaires—of which the MAIA is the most
comprehensive and broadly adopted. Interoceptive sensibility has wide-ranging implications on human health.
Deficits in interoceptive sensibility are a well-established transdiagnostic feature of eating disorders and
psychopathology in general. Better understanding this trait has implications for phenotyping eating disorders
and other mental health conditions. Targeting interoceptive sensibility in mind-body interventions is a growing
area of research. However, operationalizing this construct has been limited by measurement inconsistencies
and problems with validity. We recently conducted preliminary psychometrics and validity testing of the
MAIA's underlying common factor model (N=1294) and supported the original eight-dimension factor
structure. Our preliminary data also suggested measurement non-invariance across demographic groups and
potential unobserved population heterogeneity, which limit our ability to use the tool to evaluate interventions,
as intended. This proposal aims to address these concerns. We will collect survey data from a US Census-
matched sample of adults (N~2000) using an online platform. Our first aim will apply moderated nonlinear
factor analysis (MNLFA) to create person-specific factor scores that optimize the validity of using the MAIA to
make group comparisons, predict distal outcomes, and measure change. The MNLFA procedure identifies
which questions on the MAIA have differential item functioning across a group of relevant background and
psychosocial characteristics, including biological sex, age, body mass index, disordered eating, negative body
image, and traumatic stress. MNLFA adjusts the scoring algorithms for the factors of the scale to account for
population heterogeneity. Our second aim will apply latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify a typology of
interoceptive sensibility by clustering unobserved groups of people who tend to score similarly on the multiple
dimensions of the scale. LPA applies a person-centered approach instead of the more dominant variable-
centered approaches (such as confirmatory factor analysis) as an alternative dimension reduction technique.
The resulting typology will serve as prototypes of interoceptive sensibility with which we will generate and test
hypotheses about how the components of the MAIA interact to predict disordered eating and the associated
risk factors of negative body image and traumatic stress. In summary, one of the most impactful long-term
contributions of this project is to increase the rigor of the MAIA measurement model to expand the field's
capacity to evaluate the next generation of targeted, accessible, and broadly effective mind-body interventions."
10850196,"Project Summary
Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells has demonstrated impressive
response rates in B cell malignancies, but ACT has not mediated sustained responses in solid tumors. CD19
CAR T cell therapy has reached up to 80% response rate in the clinic; however, the main side effects are
cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), which
occur in 37–83% and about 25-35% of patients, respectively. Furthermore, one of the major obstacles in ACT
is the heterogeneity of targeted antigens and relapse due to antigen escape. Recently, we screened a cohort
of 16 FDA-approved anti-inflammatory drugs and identified clofazimine (CLF) as the top candidate for its
desired bifunctional effect for anti-CRS/ICANS and anti-antigen escape roles. Aim 1 will determine the role of
CLF in reducing macrophage-derived ROS to curtail CRS/ICANS. Aim 2 will determine the role of CLF in
driving dsRNA/dsDNA signals in macrophages for the eradication of tumors. We expect this study to
demonstrate the ability of CLF in potentiating the anti-antigen escape capacity in ACT, curbing intractable
CRS, and may also fill a desperate clinical need to improve the dismal patient survival with ICANS. This
strategy of repurposing the clinically approved CLF may hold great promise to overcome a critical obstacle in
realizing the full potential of ACT with CAR-T cells. This translationally relevant work could then lay the
foundation for future clinical trials."
10850271,"Obesity is an alarming signal for the risk of Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic diseases in
humans. Obesity results from an energy imbalance, and therefore stimulating adaptive thermogenesis has
been proposed to prevent and/or treat obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Although the identification of heat-
producing white adipocytes, beige fat, has drawn considerable attention, and this type of fat is thought to
increase energy expenditure, the mechanism and signaling molecules involved in the development of beige fat
have not yet been fully understood. Furthermore, effective medication or dietary supplement are not currently
available. Our goal is to identify novel molecule(s) that regulates beige fat formation and activity. We
hypothesize in this study that Leucine supplement improves beige fat formation by suppressing TRB3, and that
transplantation of beige fat from Leucine fed mice prevents mice from high fat diet-induced obesity and
diabetes. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of our preliminary data showing that knockout of
TRB3 promotes beige fat formation. Furthermore, Leucine, a branched-chain amino acid effectively
suppresses TRB3 expression in adipose tissue. We will test the hypothesis by pursing three specific aims. In
Aim 1, we will determine the mechanism(s) by which Leucine promotes beige fat formation. In Aim 2, we will
determine if Leucine supplement augments exercise training- and cold exposure-induced beige fat formation.
We expect that Leucine decreases TRB3 expression, which in turn promotes beige fat formation. Leucine
decreases TRB3 expression by suppressing ER stress. In Aim 3, we will determine if transplantation of beige
fat from Leucine fed mice protects against high fat diet-induced weight gain and insulin resistance. We
anticipate Leucine fed mice will resist high fat diet-induced weight gain and insulin resistance and promotes
beige fat formation. Transplantation of beige fat from Leucine fed mice will improve whole-body metabolism.
The proposed research will establish the function of TRB3 and Leucine in the beige fat formation and identify a
new approach for treating obesity and metabolic diseases. The study will be innovative in 1) investigating the
underlying mechanism by which Leucine promotes beige fat formation and metabolism; 2) studying the role of
TRB3 and Leucine in beige fat, which has not yet been studied; 3) utilizing beige fat transplantation technique
to assess the tissue effect on whole body metabolism; and 4) attempting to identify TRB3 inhibition- and/or
Leucine supplement-induced adipokines from beige fat improving whole body glucose metabolism. The
proposed study will be also significant in providing new insights into the development of treatment strategies
for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. The study will provide an opportunity for African America and/or
underrepresented students to be trained as independent researchers."
10850277,"Project Summary/Abstract
Neurophysiological and mental ailments such as epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease (PD), schizophrenia, and
Alzheimer’s disease affect millions of lives and cost the US economy more than 100 billion dollars yearly in lost
productivity. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a potential therapy for disrupting pathological
synchronous firing patterns of neurons and restoring healthy oscillations in these disorders when
pharmacological interventions fail. However, existing DBS devices require extensive clinical interventions in
tuning stimulation parameters over the treatment period. Automation of the tuning of stimulation parameters
adaptively based on the disease state and underlying stimulation-induced neural plasticity has been a long-
standing question in DBS therapy. In this project, we will address these questions in in-silico studies through
formal closed-loop model-based optimal control techniques and machine learning. The overall objective of this
project is to develop a closed-loop DBS computational framework for rigorous testing of DBS strategies and
design real-time feedback-based multi-input multi-output (MIMO) DBS techniques to provide a safe and long-
lasting effect on the desynchronization of pathological neuronal activity in PD. In Aim 1, we will develop novel
open-loop DBS techniques targeting specific forms of neural plasticity to provide long-lasting post-stimulus
desynchronization of neural activity and investigate biological mechanisms underlying DBS. In Aim 2, we will
develop a new class of MIMO closed-loop DBS techniques, using network synchrony and oscillations’ power and
phase as electrophysiological biomarkers of the disease state as feedback signals to desynchronize the excessively
(pathologically) synchronized neuronal activity and suppress abnormal disease-specific neural oscillations in
large-scale models of PD and hippocampal CA1 circuit. In Aim 3, we will develop the necessary software tools to
integrate electrophysiology hardware with the developed closed-loop DBS framework. To accomplish these
goals, we will leverage techniques from model-based closed-loop optimal control, large-scale optimization, and
machine learning. The accomplishment of these goals will bring tools from closed-loop analysis and machine
learning into the realm of neuronal desynchronization and oscillations. This will enhance our fundamental
understanding of the role of closed-loop DBS in manipulating neuronal synchrony and rhythms by harnessing
neural plasticity, ultimately enabling the development of novel neuromodulation protocols for treating a class of
brain disorders such as PD and epilepsy that are putatively caused by aberrant neural synchronization."

Epidemiologic and Machine Learning Approaches to Frame Suicide Prevention Strategies Among Juvenile
Justice Youth
PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth aged 10-24 years in the U.S. One population
found to have higher rates of suicidal behavior is youth incarcerated in the juvenile justice system. While
progress has been made to reduce suicide for youth within juvenile correctional facilities, minimal
consideration has been given to the risk for suicide in youth after incarceration. Previously incarcerated
youth face numerous challenges reintegrating back into the community which can increase their risk for
suicidal behavior. Estimates further suggest that 60% to 80% of youth involved in the justice system have
significant mental health issues, and time spent in the system can exacerbate these conditions. The unmet
need for mental health services by youth involved with the justice system is also a serious problem. Despite
the recognized risk in this vulnerable population, evidence-based suicide prevention strategies are not
integrated as part of routine reentry services for youth released from confinement. Even less is known about
successful approaches to implement these strategies in juvenile justice systems. To address this gap, the
proposed study uses innovative machine learning techniques to develop a risk prediction model
incorporating youth characteristics and contextual factors associated with confinement (violence,
victimization, segregation /isolation practices, health care services) to more accurately assess suicide risk in
youth following incarcerated. Guided by these findings and a structured implementation science framework,
this proposal will also conduct a pre-intervention assessment with key stakeholders to validate the utility of
the machine learning model to inform intervention selection. Consideration will be given to potential
facilitators and barriers to integrating the model into practice, and when, how, and where to intervene in the
juvenile justice process. Achieving the aims of this proposed study will provide targeted intervention
recommendations for suicide prevention among at-risk youth in the juvenile justice system. This proposal
will also support the training of Dr. Ruch, who is devoted to a research career to reduce suicide in youth
involved with justice system. Dr. Ruch’s training plan includes: (1) acquiring skills in machine learning and
forecast modeling techniques to more accurately identify suicide risk and inform targeted preventions for
youth in the justice system (2) enhancing knowledge of suicide prevention interventions, including health
service systems to understand how health care practices and policies may facilitate or impede intervention
for youth involved with the justice system and (3) strengthening skills in implementation science and
advanced qualitative research methods to bridge the gap between research and practice. This line of inquiry
will further the field of youth suicide research by introducing innovative technological approaches for suicide
prevention in a significantly high-risk and underserved population, while also generating new insights about
the distinct implementation challenges in the potentially resource constrained juvenile justice system."

This application requests a five-year renewal of the predoctoral training program in demographic and
population studies focused on child health and human development at the California Center for Population
Research (CCPR) at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). CCPR is the primary center for
research and training in population studies at UCLA. CCPR faculty are concentrated in Sociology, Economics,
and Community Health Sciences (CHS), the three primary disciplines in which population scientists are trained
in the U.S., as well as in related fields, e.g., geography, public policy. Recent hiring of population scientists has
increased the number of CCPR affiliates and attracted increased numbers of students interested in
demographic and population studies. Accordingly, funding is requested for 6 predoctoral traineeships per year,
an increase of 2 over our training grant award in 2001 and the renewal in 2006, 2011, and 2017.
 The training program we seek to renew and expand builds on strong graduate programs in sociology,
economics, and public health; distinguished multi-disciplinary faculty with a diverse research portfolio spanning
economic, social, and health demography and reflects the NICHD/PDB mission; and abundant resources for
population research at UCLA. We seek to train the next generation of population scientists to carry out
theoretically informed, methodologically sophisticated research on topics of contemporary relevance that relate
to population studies. We have built an innovative curriculum in each of the three core departments, Sociology,
Economics, and CHS, and integrated interdisciplinary training in population science into their programs.
 For the renewal, we retain the existing features of our successful program, including a training seminar
with presentations by invited speakers, trainee proseminar, mentorship, and cross-disciplinary coursework.
Since the previous renewal, we have added a Student Seminar Series, initiated the Annual Robert Mare
Student Lectureship, and now participate in two cross-center virtual Seminar Series. We also strengthened our
training on demographic methods with a new course on population dynamics and models complementing the
existing course on demographic indicators and measurement. We also introduced a Certificate in Population
Research to recognize student Affiliates who participate in training activities in two consecutive years and at
least once in the annual meetings of the Population Association of America (PAA).
 The program has a remarkable record of success at producing independent investigators who carry out
cutting-edge research in social, economic, and public health topics that reflect the NICHD mission. Of the 31
trainees who have completed their PhD since 2007, 14 are now assistant or associate professors at major
universities, 4 are postdoctoral researchers at major universities, and 6 hold research intensive-positions.
Thus, most trainees secure tenure-track faculty or other research intensive positions, often preceded by
prestigious postdoctoral fellowships."

Candidate: Dina H. Griauzde, MD, MSc is a general internist and early career health services researcher focused on preventing type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Dr. Griauzde’s long-term career objective is to become an independent physician-scientist leading the development and evaluation of tailored, multilevel interventions for T2DM prevention that can be scaled and sustained within diverse practice settings. 
Research Context: Weight loss is the key driver of T2DM risk reduction. Patients prefer and benefit from preference-sensitive weight loss treatment plans, which may require adaptations over time to optimize outcomes. While primary care providers and practices theoretically play a central role in supporting patients’ weight loss, they lack coordinated, effective, and sustainable strategies to personalize and adapt treatment plans to help more individuals with prediabetes achieve clinically significant weight loss. Accordingly, obesity remains poorly managed in primary care settings. 
Specific Aims: The overarching aim of this proposal is to use implementation science (i.e., the study of provider behavior within the context of organizational constraints) to develop, implement, and evaluate a novel multilevel intervention to support personalized and adaptable weight loss treatment plans in primary care settings. Multilevel interventions target at least two levels of influence (e.g., providers, health system) and are a promising strategy to promote significant and sustained changes in clinical practice. Intervention components will be selected to address key determinants of successfully supporting patients’ weight loss. 
Research Plan: Dr. Griauzde will use a theory-based implementation science checklist to guide semi-structured interviews with patients, providers, practice staff, and system leaders to identify determinants of successfully supporting patients’ weight loss (Aim 1). She will then link key determinants to evidence- and theory-based implementation strategies to develop of a novel, multilevel intervention, consisting of (1) personalized weight loss plans; (2) remote weight monitoring; and (3) proactive outreach by primary care teams and/or automated tools to provide support and/or adapt treatment plans to optimize weight loss (Aim 2). She will evaluate the intervention using a match cohort analysis (Aim 3). These data will inform a future multisite study of the refined intervention.

The role that chronic viral infection plays in shaping the immune system and responses to subsequent
infections is critically important but understudied. It is estimated that >80% of adults harbor at least 5 latent
herpesviruses. Gammaherpesviruses establish latency in immune cells, further highlighting the importance of
understanding how latency impacts host immune responses to subsequent infections. Currently there is a
substantial knowledge gap in the role played by latency and/or mechanisms by which prior gammaherpesvirus
infection contributes to subsequent immune responses, particularly in the lung. Despite the known deleterious
effects of herpesvirus infection on human health, emerging evidence suggests the possibility the latent
herpesvirus infection may actually protect from secondary infections.
Therefore, to uncover key mechanisms by which latency impacts subsequent immune responses, I propose
the following: I will test the premise that gammaherpesvirus latency impacts host protection during subsequent
pulmonary infections that are prevalent across Kingdoms and dissect how latently infected immune cells
intrinsically respond to heterologous pathogens. I will also delineate the impact of the microbiota on
establishment and maintenance of herpesvirus latency given the critical impact of the microbiota on immune
responses and the broad use of potent antibiotics in medical practice. These distinct but equally important
directives will fill key knowledge gaps.
At the completion, I expect to define the role of latency and reactivation on human immune responsiveness
and develop a framework to define how the balance between microbiota and secondary infections are informed
by latency. Moreover, this study is clinically relevant and fundamentally significant as these findings have the
potential to define novel mechanisms and pathways important for pathogen control and tissue repair.
In alignment with the Stephen I. Katz funding mechanism, this proposal represents a new direction for my
research program. While I have previously studied cytokine regulation of herpesvirus latency during my
doctoral thesis and identified protective microbial metabolites in pulmonary infection as a postdoctoral fellow, I
have not investigated how viral latency intrinsically impacts immune cell function during secondary pulmonary
infections or how the microbiota influences the establishment and maintenance of latency. This new
investigation will require acquisition of novel tools and technologies that will reshape my research program and
enhance its scope and impact. I am perfectly positioned to direct and execute this unique line of investigation
as I have expertise across multiple relevant domains including virology, microbiology, immunology, and critical
care medicine. Additionally as an Early Stage Investigator, I have established collaborations with experts
across diverse domains of microbial pathogenesis."

A Global Burden Disease survey commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated a 27.6%
increase in cases of major depressive disorder (MDD) during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among
specific vulnerable groups including healthcare workers (HCW), those with pre-existing medical/mental health
conditions, as well as ethnic minority communities, many of whom may have their wellbeing challenged from
additional stressors compounded by negative social determinants of health (SDOH). Recent findings from the
EMBARC study have shown that small lipid molecules called eicosanoids, which act as both activators and
suppressors of inflammatory activity as well as modulators of innate and adaptive immunity, are known to have
a significant impact on the subacute and chronic sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, in addition to risk for unresolved
immune-mediated inflammatory conditions such as CVD. Eicosanoids have also been found to be a contributor
of chronic neuroinflammatory conditions such as depression in other studies. Advanced mass spectrometry
methods now allow for the rapid and accurate quantification of hundreds of upstream eicosanoid mediators
representing multiple enzymatic origins. Hence, this proposal aims to provide a more detailed understanding of
how upstream eicosanoid pathways can be variably active, imbalanced, and perturbed in relation to an
individual’s propensity for developing depression. We will leverage the expertise of an interprofessional team,
including current members of the EMBARC research study team, to test the hypothesis that: 1) SARS-CoV-2
infection and reinfections moderate development of chronic immune-mediated neuroinflammatory condition such
as depression as evidenced by changes in eicosanoid profiles; and 2) health impacts of SDOH compounds
depression risk following SARS-CoV-2 infection and reinfection by moderating the neuroimmune-inflammatory
response. We propose a systematic approach to comprehensively investigating the components of upstream
inflammatory activity in relation to outcomes across the spectrum of depression risk through the collection of
longitudinal (survey, clinical, biomarker) data from a large and diverse population of people already enrolled in
the EMBARC research study and will use a variety of methods (e.g., eicosanoid profiling, use of public available
health equity data set) to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection and the SDOH impact on neuroinflammation that is
associated with depression. This work will pave the way for follow-up studies investigating the efficacy of anti-
inflammatory therapies, including both existing and novel agents, for modulating variation in distinct eicosanoids
and, in turn, mental health outcomes such as depression."

Building on our track record in genomic research, clinical trials, and genomic medicine in diverse, underserved
patients from NYC, we propose to develop new frameworks to bring genomic risk into clinical care to promote
health equity. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are entering an exciting phase where they are poised to improve
health outcomes for myriad complex diseases through enhanced risk stratification and clinical decision making.
However, major challenges exist for clinical PRS implementation today. The vast majority of PRS have far
greater predictive value in individuals of European ancestry than other ancestries, and issues of access to
leading-edge genomic technology, research, and testing disproportionately impact underserved populations.
To address this, Mount Sinai experts in statistical genetics and population genetics, with decade-long
experience in building methods tailored to diverse and admixed populations, will work together to rigorously
develop multi-ethnic PRS. We will integrate multi-ethnic PRS with standard clinical risk and family history
information to generate genomic risk assessments for 15 common diseases. Drawing on Mount Sinai's century
of experience serving one of the most diverse patient populations in the world, we will recruit 2,500 adult and
pediatric patients from diverse and underserved populations into a clinical trial. We will estimate participants'
individualized risk for each condition, and investigate the impact of genomic risk communication to patients and
their physicians, including patient understanding and uptake of recommended risk-reducing interventions. We
will explore attitudes, barriers, and communication preferences related to genomic risk assessment in diverse
populations. Knowledge gained will be used to guide the development of a new multilingual patient-facing
digital platform supporting patient education and communication of genomic risk. We will track patient
engagement with their results through the platform, and assess the impact of individualized genomic risk
assessments on patient-reported psychosocial outcomes and experiences. As of today, the path to effectively
integrate genomic risk into clinical care in busy health systems, particularly for diverse patients, is unclear.
Hence, we are partnering with clinicians, scientists, industry experts, and community stakeholders to explore a
range of strategies to assess, communicate, and reduce disease risk, in order to maximize the efficiency of
genomic medicine delivery, and promote health equity."

The long-term goal of our research program is to understand how cells fine-tune their metabolic programs to
meet their ever-changing energetic needs. Many cell types in the body, from muscle fibers to neurons, have
evolved unique metabolic programs that are essential for survival and proper function. Even within a single cell,
specific processes are energetically coupled to mitochondria or the glycolytic machinery for specialized metabolic
support. However, the underlying molecular basis of metabolic plasticity and its relationship to cellular
function are poorly understood. Understanding the mechanisms of metabolic regulation is highly relevant to
many disease states, including diabetes, myopathies, and Leigh syndrome, where metabolic dysfunction is
heavily implicated. In eukaryotic cells, energy, in the form of ATP molecules is primarily produced by glycolysis
and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. My laboratory combines optical imaging of biosensors in live cells
with genomics and transcriptomic analysis to investigate metabolic regulation in cellular compartments. With
these tools, we have been able to discover novel pathways for stimulation of mitochondrial and glycolytic ATP
production in active neurons during electrical activity. We now seek to understand how energy metabolism
is locally regulated in subcellular compartments, and uncover metabolic specialization of functionally
distinct neuronal types. To carry out this work, we plan to utilize our strength in cellular imaging of metabolic
function along with new technological advances to: (1) determine how subcellular organization of the glycolytic
machinery regulates synaptic vesicle endocytosis, and (2) elucidate molecular mechanisms of metabolic
specialization using the available transcriptional profiles of neuronal subtypes. Our study will shed light on both
local and global mechanisms of metabolic plasticity at the subcellular level and across cell types. As such, our
findings will be broadly relevant to the scientific community studying cellular metabolism and its implications in
disease states."

The requested instrument is a DELTA Q™ Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer. This state-of-the-art instrument
allows for the precise and sensitive measurement of the isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen and
hydrogen from the plasma of a variety of different biospecimens, including whole blood, urine and breath. Our
collaborative team of perinatal, pediatric, and adult scientists share the common goal of understanding how
alternations in metabolism affect an individual’s risk for developing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and
obesity. Major and Minor users in this group include NIH-funded individuals who are actively studying the fetal
antecedents of heart disease and diabetes (Major users: Brown, Rozance, Stremming, Wesolowski, Limesand;
Minor users; Anthony, White) and the impact of activity and diet on metabolism and diabetes and obesity risk
(Major user: Bergouignan). The instrument will enhance the goals of our NIH-funded research projects by
providing measurements of enrichment of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen after infusion of stable isotope
tracers, which enable us to estimate substrate oxidation rates and total daily energy expenditure in response to
disease states (placental insufficiency and IUGR in early stages of life, obesity and diabetes in later stages of
life) as well as therapeutic interventions such as dietary intervention, growth factor supplementation, and
exercise. We have outstanding technical expertise to process samples and optimally maintain the instrument, a
cost-effective financial plan to support the instrument, and significant institutional support to maximize
utilization of the instrument for all users. In summary, the DELTA QTM IRMS instrument will further our

Just within the past few years, there has been a remarkable progress in the field of single-cell and spatial biology,
illustrating the importance of understanding how particular cell types and cell states relate with one another. The
Mass Cytometry Facility at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), an operation within the Flow/Mass Cytometry
Shared Resource at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC), houses just one mass
cytometry platform, the Helios/Hyperion system, which switches between suspension and imaging modes. This
system is currently the only mass cytometry unit that is accessible by the Johns Hopkins community. Mass
cytometry overcomes any issues with fluorescence, such as cellular or tissue autofluorescence and spectral
spillover, allowing for the robust assessment of 40+ parameters at a per-cell basis. Since the establishment of
mass cytometry services in August 2021 made possible by the support of the Johns Hopkins Convergence
Institute and the JHU SKCCC, the usage of mass cytometry has been consistently increasing. With the recent
funding of major research activities by the NIH, the demand for mass cytometry services is expected to continue
growing dramatically, prompting this proposal for the funds to acquire a second mass cytometer in the form of
CyTOF XT, the latest generation mass cytometer, at our Mass Cytometry Facility. Mass cytometry will be
incorporated into the NIH-funded research activities led by more than 10 Major and 5 Minor Users across multiple
research programs and departments at Johns Hopkins, tackling important questions in pancreatic cancers, liver
cancers, breast cancers, computational biology, and dermatology. This unique discovery tool will also support
the research of several early-career investigators and other future users from the Johns Hopkins research
community at large. The successful implementation of a second mass cytometer will be facilitated by Dr. Won
Jin Ho’s (PI) expertise in mass cytometry techniques, experienced facility staff, existing infrastructure for the
system, and strong commitments from the School of Medicine, the SKCCC, the Convergence Institute, as well
as the Department of Cell Biology, the Department of Pathology, and the Division of Quantitative Sciences at
Johns Hopkins. This much needed expansion of mass cytometry services will sustain the prompt delivery of high
quality data to the researchers at Johns Hopkins and significantly accelerate the discovery process in biomedical
research."

growing demand for fragment-based drug screening applications, as well as increasing
emphasis upon understanding structural aspects of complex binding interactions between
biological macromolecules, especially those which rely on the TROSY effect to enhance
sensitivity and resolution. It will provide essential 19F capabilities, not presently available. It will
provide access to state-of-the-art training in NMR-based structural biology methods for many
NIH pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees at Vanderbilt University, including trainees from
primarily undergraduate institutions serving historically under-represented populations in the
STEM and biomedical sciences. Extensive site preparation or renovation will not be necessary

University Biomolecular NMR Facility (VUBNMR), operated by the Vanderbilt Center in
Structural Biology (CSB). The VUBNMR Facility is dedicated to studies of biological
macromolecules, fragment-based drug discovery, and complex biomolecular binding
interactions. It is housed in a dedicated building in the Stevenson Science Center, centrally
located on the Vanderbilt campus. It is directed by Prof. Markus Voehler, who has many years
of expertise, both in the operation and laboratory support of high field NMR instrumentation. The
facility houses a helium liquefier serving NMR cryomagnets. The proposed 800 MHz NMR is
anticipated to be used heavily, ~95% of AUT, calculated on a 365 d/yr and 24 h/d basis.
Administrative and financial plans for operating and maintaining the 800 MHz NMR and
managing laboratory operations are in place."

Plasma concentrations of von Willebrand Factor (VWF), a central component of primary hemostasis, vary five-
fold in human populations and are controlled by the balance of cellular secretion rates and half-life in the
circulation. The critical role of plasma VWF concentration in hemostasis is demonstrated by the increased risk
for the bleeding disorder von Willebrand disease (VWD) in individuals with low plasma VWF and the heightened
risk for venous thromboembolic disease, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke in individuals with high
plasma VWF. Patients with bleeding phenotypes and low concentrations of plasma VWF are diagnosed Type I
VWD, the most common inherited bleeding disorder. This proposal refers to VWF coding changes as cis variants.
To date, the accepted understanding of the functional consequences of VWF cis variation originates from low-
throughput, laboratory-based investigations of patient-derived mutations. But the vast majority of potential VWF
missense variants have never been characterized, which leads to uncertainty when clinicians identify new
variants of unknown significance in their patients with bleeding phenotypes. In healthy individuals, plasma VWF
levels are highly heritable (64.5%) and mostly determined by variation outside the VWF locus. For example,
common blood type–linked variants in the ABO gene determine ~20% of the variation in plasma VWF. Genome-
wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple genetic loci outside of the VWF locus where common
variants are associated with altered plasma VWF levels, implicating a strong role in VWD. The impact of these
trans variants on plasma VWF levels is further implicated by the fact that 30% of the population of individuals
with moderately low VWF (30-50 I.U./dL) and bleeding have no identifiable mutation in the VWF gene. Therefore,
a large gap in the understanding of VWF biology that drives bleeding or thrombosis risk is the role of cis and
trans genetic variants. The objective of this proposal is to comprehensively characterize VWF cis variation and
to identify a network of genes harboring trans genetic variants that are critical for VWF secretion. To achieve this
objective, Aim I will use high-throughput techniques to validate and expand a deep mutational scan of VWF and
generate a comprehensive map of cis missense variants that alter VWF secretion. Aim II will identify trans genes
critical for VWF secretion in a reporter cell line and in a cultured endothelial cell system using lentiviral delivered
CRISPR/Cas9. Both aims will take advantage of access to whole genome sequencing data from several hundred
patients with VWD Type I in the NHLBI-funded Zimmerman Program on VWF Biology. The combined experience
of the assembled group of investigators will leverage the group’s previous history of collaborative science and
capitalize on complementary expertise with deep mutational scanning, CRISPR screening, and VWF biology.
Results from the proposed studies are expected to reduce the burden of variants of unknown significance in
clinical diagnostic studies of bleeding disorders and uncover molecular mechanisms driving altered plasma VWF
levels."

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying muscle growth and wasting is highly relevant to
conditions such as anorexia, sarcopenia, and diseases such as cachexia. Muscle size is regulated by the
coordinated balance between protein synthesis and degradation. The IGF1-AKT-mTOR axis is a central player
in regulating increase in protein synthesis by stimulating the translational machinery while simultaneously
blocking protein degradation pathways, the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome
pathway. Drosophila muscle is a well-established system to study the maintenance of muscle mass, TOR
signaling and autophagy. We have recently identified two new RNA biogenesis signaling pathways that
regulate autophagy and metabolism downstream of TOR. In Aim 1, we will characterize RNA biogenesis
processes regulated by TOR signaling in muscles, focusing on the regulation of autophagy and metabolism. In
addition, we have established the adult fly midgut as a model to study tumor-induced host wasting. This model
has allowed us to precisely follow transcriptional changes and morphological events leading to muscle wasting.
In Aim 2, we will characterize the role of REPTOR, a transcription factor downstream of TOR, that we
hypothesize acts as a “master regulator of cachexia” and will characterize its regulation and target genes. We
will also analyze the role of mitophagy in muscle wasting. Finally, we have identified three factors, ImPL2,
PvF1, and Upd3, derived from gut tumors that contribute to muscle wasting. We will characterize the role of an
additional pathway, the Branchless/FGF pathway. In addition, we will perform a proteomic screen using a novel
proximity labeling method to identify additional factors derived from tumors that affect wasting. Altogether,
our studies will reveal novel cell autonomous and non-autonomous molecular mechanisms involved in the
regulation of muscle mass. Considering the high level of conservation between Drosophila and higher
organisms our studies are likely to help in the long term to devise treatments of conditions such as anorexia,
sarcopenia and cachexia."

Recent studies have demonstrated that the adaptive immune response plays an important role Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) progression by promoting a pro-inflammatory state in the brain. This inflammatory process involves
T cell and microglial cell activation. Such inflammatory processes are typically suppressed by a subset of T cells
called regulatory T cells (Tregs). Significantly, Treg dysfunction is associated with AD in humans and in mouse
models of AD. In addition to decreased Tregs in AD cases, studies have demonstrated that systemic depletion
of Tregs exacerbates early AD pathology, while an increase in Tregs attenuates early AD pathology in transgenic
mouse models of AD. However, these previous studies come with important caveats. First, all studies involving
Treg depletion focused on studies in young mice at early stages of AD pathology, which may not be a clinically
relevant time-point. Second, studies using FOXP3-DTR mice and diphtheria toxin to selectively deplete Tregs
deplete Tregs everywhere and induce body-wide inflammation. This makes it difficult to assess whether worse
outcomes observed in AD upon “Treg depletion” are specific to an effect of Tregs in the brain or due to massive
systemic inflammation. Moreover, the types of Tregs that accumulate during AD progression, and their functional
role in disease progression, particularly in brain, are also unknown. Thus, major gaps in our knowledge are
(i) what types of Tregs are found in the brain during steady-state and in Alzheimer’s disease and, (ii)
what role Tregs or distinct subsets of Tregs play in ameliorating AD. Our preliminary studies demonstrate
that Tregs in tissues are quite diverse and that distinct Treg subsets occupy inflamed tissues with different
kinetics. Most notably, we identified a novel population of Tregs, called ISG-Tregs, that accumulate in tissues
with IFN-driven inflammation. Previous studies of AD demonstrate that type I IFN is a characteristic of AD, that
it exacerbates neurological damage in AD models, and plays an important role in initiating neuroinflammation
and promoting AD progression. Thus, ISG-Tregs may play a critical role in AD progression. The goal of this
proposal is to identify the subsets of Tregs present in the brain, and identify where those subsets are
located within the brain, during AD progression, and establish murine models to directly test the function
of Tregs and Treg subsets in AD. We will use scRNA-Seq and spatial proteomic/transcriptomic approaches to
characterize Tregs during AD progression. Using a novel Treg reporter/deleter mouse strain that we developed
we will also develop new mouse models that will allow us to study the function of brain Tregs, or select brain
Treg subsets, on AD progression. We will also provide important information regarding the pathological role of
Treg at different stages of AD in vivo. These studies will allow us to characterize the types of Tregs present in
AD, establish their localization in the brain during disease progression, and develop models that will allow us to
establish their functional role in ameliorating or exacerbating Alzheimer’s disease in the future. Such information
will prove critical for better implementation of Treg-based therapies to improve outcomes in Alzheimer’s disease."

In the US, Black mothers and infants experience disproportionately worse pregnancy-related
health outcomes. Black mothers are 1.5-4 times more likely to die within a year of birth
compared to non-Black mothers, and Black infants are 2-3 times more likely to die compared to
non-Black infants. These elevated rates have further been tied to elevated rates of obstetric
cardiovascular complications for mothers, and preterm birth and low birthweight for infants. The
causes for these disparities are unknown, but evidence to date suggests that they are likely
social and environmental in nature. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify the determinants of
these racial disparities to elucidate the highest priority targets for intervention. The proposed
research will evaluate how micro- (e.g., interpersonal, family) and macro-level (e.g.,
neighborhood, environmental) risk and resiliency factors transact to shape maternal-infant
health. Additionally, this research interrogates the psychobiological mechanisms that underlie
their associations (i.e., physiological stress dysregulation, as indexed by i.e., salivary cortisol,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia, electrodermal activity). Specific aims are to: (1) determine the
intra- and intergenerational health consequences of maternal exposure to multi-level stressors
and resiliency factors both during pregnancy and across her life course, (2) evaluate the
mechanistic role of maternal and infant stress physiology in shaping maternal-infant health, and
(3) estimate the extent to which paternal support may promote maternal-infant health both
during pregnancy and the postpartum. To achieve these aims, this prospective longitudinal
study will follow 350 Black families (mothers, fathers, infants) from pregnancy through the first
postpartum year, with home visits during pregnancy, and at infant ages 6 and 12 months. This
research utilizes a multi-method approach, and draws from self-report, psychophysiological
assessment, behavioral observations, medical record abstraction, and spatial analyses using
Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Additionally, this research emphasizes risk (e.g.,
interpersonal and structural racism) and resiliency (e.g., racial identity, cultural beliefs and
values) factors of particular relevance for Black Americans. The long-term objective of this
research is to identify targets through which to promote health in generations of Black U.S.
families."
10842311,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous, life-threatening condition defined by
poor oxygenation and bilateral pulmonary edema that carries a mortality rate >40% in most studies. Every
ARDS drug trial to date has failed, perhaps because the clinical criteria defining ARDS include a substantial
subset of low-risk patients. Clinical scoring systems poorly predict which ARDS patients will develop prolonged
respiratory failure and are at increased risk of death.
 Molecular profiling of pulmonary edema fluid could serve as a window on the alveolar microenvironment,
enabling identification of high-risk patients. Pulmonary edema directly reflects lung pathobiology including loss
of barrier integrity, inflammation, and epithelial damage. Unfortunately, free-flowing pulmonary edema has
limited clinical utility because it can only be captured in a minority of patients. Molecular characterization of
pulmonary edema is now possible in every patient with ARDS because of two critical innovations. First, we
discovered that edema fluid condensing in the HME (heat and moisture exchanger) filter of the ventilator
circuit, usually discarded as trash, closely reflects free-flowing edema. Second, we developed a non-targeted
metabolomic fingerprinting method using mass spectroscopy that characterizes molecular components in trace
quantities of fluid. Together, these innovations make it possible to test the central hypothesis that molecular
features of edema fluid reflect pathobiology and enable ARDS risk stratification.
 To address the prognostic enrichment potential of HME edema fluid, 300 early ARDS patients will be
recruited at 3 US centers, with protocolized HME edema fluid collection. Aim 1 is to study whether high HME
edema fluid total protein and lung-injury specific proteins predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS.
Aim 2 is to test whether hypermetabolic edema fluid and inflammatory lipids predict prolonged respiratory
failure ≥48h in ARDS. In Aim 3, LASSO machine learning will be used to integrate all proteomic and
metabolomic edema features into a prolonged mechanical ventilation classifier. The robustness of the classifier
will be assessed by measuring whether it adds prognostic value to clinical ARDS severity scores, identifying
how well key molecular features are reflected in plasma, and testing for replication in an independent cohort.
 The goal of these studies is to examine to what extent a novel and readily available lung-specific sample,
obtained early in the course of ARDS, reflects biology and can predict ARDS outcomes, thus offering
prognostic enrichment for future clinical trials. Successful completion of the Specific Aims offers the potential
for a much-needed classification scheme to better refine, understand, and therapeutically-target ARDS."

Disrupted energy metabolism is a central driver of dysfunction and death in a wide range of diseases, and may
also contribute to aging. Energy failure, or insufficient energy to support normal function, can lead to
neurodegenerative diseases, ischemia and heart failure, while an imbalance in energy production may contribute
to cancer. As such, boosting energy levels has great therapeutic potential to improve cellular function and
survival. However, there are only anecdotal examples of how to increase or preserve cellular ATP levels. To
address this critical unmet need for anti-aging and energy-focused therapeutics, we developed an innovative
high throughput screen that uses a fluorescent biosensor to measure ATP levels in individual cells, and used it
to identify genes and pathways that regulate ATP levels. In this proposal, we will test our central hypothesis
that increasing ATP can enhance the function and survival of vulnerable cells, but the efficacy depends on the
mechanism by which ATP is increased. The overall objectives of our proposed study are to define the most

and survival of human cells that are susceptible to diseases of energy failure. We will accomplish these objectives
in two specific aims. (1) We will use metabolomics, transcriptomics and assays of energy production and
consumption to determine the broad mechanisms by which energy levels can be increased. (2) We will determine
if increasing the ATP level can enhance the function and survival of human neurons and cardiomyocytes. Overall,
these studies will i) determine the broad cellular mechanisms by which cellular energy levels can be increased,
and ii) begin to assess the therapeutic potential of increasing energy levels to protect against energy failure in
metabolically vulnerable human cells."
10845111,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - INTEGRATED MICROSCOPY FACILITY (IMF)
Microscopy is an essential technology for cancer investigators, providing imaging to test hypotheses about
physiologic processes at the whole-animal, organ, cell, and now at near-molecular level. The Integrated
Microscopy Facility (IMF) provides state-of-the-art imaging capabilities to University of Chicago Medicine
Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC) investigators and others. The major objective of the IMF is to
provide imaging expertise and instrumentation to advance investigator-driven basic and translational cancer
research and foster the research output of the investigators. The IMF offers all major light and confocal laser
microscopy instrumentation (including wide-field apparatuses), in addition to super-resolution technologies
(e.g., stimulated emission depletion or STED, localization, structured light). In the reporting period, IMF
supported 79 unique UCCCC members (47% MMC, 9% CPC, 22% IC, 18% CET, 5% ZY), with 179 peer-
reviewed cancer-related federal grants and 103 peer-reviewed publications (48% in journals with impact
factor ≥10).
A key goal for the IMF is to keep operating costs within reach of all UCCCC laboratories, accordingly, IMF
has made over $1.8M in equipment upgrades since 2018, all with institutional funds. Future efforts are aimed
at maintaining the high-quality services offered. To meet evolving demands, IMF will continually evaluate
rapidly evolving technologies to make state of the art tools available for the diverse needs of UCCCC
investigators. Computational approaches (e.g., “deep learning” techniques) likewise are now enhancing data
gathering and analyses. This Core will strive to match the diverse tools available to the diverse needs of the
UCCCC Investigators."

 Retinal degenerations are a large cluster of diseases characterized by the irreversible loss of
photoreceptors. The death of these cells results in a permanent loss of vision that can have debilitating
impacts on an individual's quality of life. Despite the diversity among triggers for retinal degenerations, the
mechanisms surrounding photoreceptor death are often similar, suggesting the possibility of developing
gene/mutation-independent approaches to reduce blindness from multiple forms of retinal degeneration. We
and others have shown that STAT3 is activated in all retinal cells, including photoreceptors and Müller cells
during inherited retinal degeneration. Additional work has shown that activation of STAT3 plays an essential
role in promoting a wide array of gene expression changes to increase the cell’s capacity to resist cell death.
However, despite these impressive findings, little progress has been made in identifying the mechanisms by
which STAT3 regulates protection. In this project, we will use state of the art techniques including single-cell
RNA-seq and integrating the data with cell-specific ChIP-seq to comprehensively identify all genes and
transcriptional networks regulated by STAT3 in retinal Müller cells and rods."
10933451,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by the progression from recreational drinking to uncontrollable and
excessive consumption resulting in a myriad of social and neurobiological complications. The mechanisms
underlying the dependence-induced escalation in drinking are not completely understood. However, a key brain
region disrupted in individuals with AUD is the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Studies from the Woodward laboratory
show that acute ethanol inhibits action potential firing of lateral orbitofrontal (lOFC) cortex pyramidal neurons.
This occurs via an astrocyte-dependent process involving activation of astrocytic D1/D5 dopamine receptors and
the release of glycine via reversal of the GlyT1 glycine transporter. Following chronic intermittent exposure (CIE)
to alcohol, lOFC neurons become hyperexcitable and are tolerant to acute ethanol. However, the effects of CIE
exposure on lOFC astrocytes and how this affects lOFC neuronal excitability are not completely understood. The
overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that CIE exposure impairs lOFC astrocyte function that contributes to
hyperexcitability of lOFC pyramidal neurons and the resulting dependence-induced escalation in drinking. This
hypothesis will be tested with two complementary aims. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that CIE-induced increases
in lOFC neuronal excitability and loss of acute ethanol inhibition involves astrocytic calcium signaling. To test
this, male and female C57BL/6J mice will receive an intra-OFC infusion of an astrocyte-selective AAV encoding
either a plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) or a reporter construct (tdTomato). Following repeated
cycles of CIE exposure, slice electrophysiology will be used to measure current-evoked spiking of lOFC neurons
and the membrane potential of lOFC astrocytes. Training in viral infusion surgeries and astrocyte and neuron
slice electrophysiology will be achieved under this aim. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that expressing PMCA in
lOFC astrocytes prevents the increases in drinking following CIE exposure. In the first study, male and female
C57BL/6J mice expressing either PMCA or tdTomato localized in lOFC astrocytes will undergo baseline sessions
of two-bottle choice ethanol drinking. Weekly sessions of CIE exposure will then be interleaved with test weeks
of drinking. The second study will follow the same CIE paradigm with the absence of homecage drinking and will
use mice expressing GCaMP6f in lOFC astrocytes and the red-shifted opsin ChrimsonR in lOFC neurons.
Training in astrocyte fiber photometry and optogenetics will be achieved under this aim. The proposed research
studies will be complemented by career development activities including manuscript preparation, data
presentation, networking, and training in the responsible conduct of research. These studies will provide novel
insight into the role of lOFC astrocytes in AUD and position me to pursue a productive career in alcohol research."

 Brain image data collected by the neuroscience community will continue to grow
dramatically in the next 5-10 years as the push to image physically larger volumes, such as
whole brains from humans and other primates, becomes a focus. The scientific community, with
the support of NIH data sharing policies, expect this valuable data to be shared and made
available to the community as rapidly as possible.
 The Brain Image Library (BIL) is a public resource serving the neuroscience community by
providing a persistent scalable repository for sharing microscopy data generated by brain
researchers. Importantly, raw data can be archived with BIL, and all post-processing and
analysis can be completed at BIL and rapidly made publicly available. BIL maximizes data
reusability by providing rapid access to a range of community-specific software suites and user-
specific software which can quickly access a variety of high-performance computational
resources including GPU, CPU, high-RAM and machine learning nodes. This one-stop access
encourages the reuse of data by making it easily accessible to a variety of scientists and
promotes transparency and scientific discovery as the outcomes of any meta-analysis can be
made public and tied directly to the original data content."
10850853,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Despite strong consensus that early, specialized intervention for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder
(ASD) can have a dramatic impact on outcomes, the U.S. health system’s capacity to provide such services is
severely challenged by the rapid rise in ASD prevalence. The long-term goal is to improve outcomes for
children with early signs of ASD by increasing the capacity to provide appropriately specialized treatment
within an existing infrastructure: the Part C Early Intervention (EI) service delivery system. Part C is publicly
funded, available in all areas, and serves children under age 3 who have developmental delays or disabilities.
Currently, the effectiveness of EI services is limited by high practice variation and infrequent use of evidence-
based interventions. The study objective is to improve services and outcomes for children with early signs of
ASD by conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the effectiveness of training EI providers to
deliver Reciprocal Imitation Training (RIT). RIT is a naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention (NDBI)
that is ideally suited for EI settings because it is low intensity, play-based, easy to learn and implement, and
can be taught to families for their independent use, thus increasing intervention dosage.
 This RCT will employ a hybrid type 1 effectiveness/implementation design, and will use a unique mixed
methods approach to gather evidence that will be essential for implementing RIT at scale, pending positive trial
results. The sample includes 20 EI agencies across 4 U.S. States and comprises a total of 160 EI providers
and 440 families of children with early symptoms of ASD, which not only provides a robust sample size, but
also affords the opportunity to assess generalizability of this approach across regions that vary in their
implementation of Part C services. EI providers will be randomly assigned to the RIT training group (n=80) or
treatment as usual (TAU; n=80). Providers in both groups will identify 2-5 children in their caseload who are
16-30 months old with early symptoms of ASD (n=220 children per group). Intensive, state-of-the art, multi-
method assessment technology will be used to measure the impact of the intervention on children’s language
and social communication, as well as parents’ self-efficacy and well-being. Importantly, this study will examine
putative mechanisms (i.e., child gains in imitation and joint attention; parent contingent responsiveness)
through which the intervention improves clinically-relevant outcomes. Data regarding provider-initiated
modifications to the intervention and delivery will be analyzed to identify fidelity-consistent vs. fidelity-
inconsistent changes, which will inform refinement of future RIT training and quality assurance procedures. In
sum, this study will generate the evidence necessary to implement RIT at scale, thereby increasing the
capacity of the existing EI system to deliver effective, evidence-based intervention to the rapidly growing
population of children who show early signs of ASD."

10850971,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the treatment of choice for many patients with malignancies
as well as other life-threatening conditions such as primary immunodeficiency disorders (PID). Chronic
norovirus infection is a potential complication of HSCT, and can cause chronic diarrhea and wasting. There are
currently no available therapies to treat norovirus. We have demonstrated that healthy individuals have T cell
immunity against norovirus, and that viral epitopes in antigens NS6 and VP1 are well conserved across viral
genotypes. The overarching goal of this proposal is the development of a novel treatment for chronic norovirus
infection in patients undergoing HSCT. In our previous study, we demonstrated safety and potential efficacy of
virus-specific T cells targeting CMV, EBV, and adenovirus as well as the feasibility of this approach. To restore
immunity against norovirus we now propose to take blood from the healthy donors and expand and enrich the
norovirus-specific T cells (NSTs) present in donors' blood, followed by extensive characterization of the
function of NSTs. We will then give NSTs as treatment for chronic norovirus in patients who have undergone
HSCT. If successful, this novel antiviral therapy could provide long-term protection against norovirus. Thus, we
hypothesize that the infusion of NSTs will be safe and effective against norovirus infections in patients post
HSCT, and will restore lasting immunity against norovirus. We further hypothesize that antiviral efficacy will
correlate with expansion of T cells recognizing immunodominant viral epitopes, which will correspond to stable
regions of the viral genome. Through this phase I IND study, we will address the following specific aims: 1) To
determine the breadth of norovirus T cell epitopes and MHC restrictions, as well as their genetic stability in
clinical viral isolates, 2) To study the safety and feasibility of administering ex vivo expanded T cells targeting
norovirus as treatment of chronic infection in immunocompromised patients, and 3) To determine whether
infusion of NSTs can enhance norovirus specific immunity in immune compromised hosts. Collectively, these
aims will determine if NSTs may be a safe and effective treatment for chronic norovirus infection in patients
post HSCT. Completion of this study could provide a novel antiviral therapy which could reduce virus-
associated morbidity in HSCT, and will guide future cellular therapy and vaccine trials targeting enteric viruses."

The NIH Common Fund (CF) programs have produced transformative datasets, databases,
methods, bioinformatics tools and workflows that are significantly advancing biomedical research
in the United States and worldwide. Currently, CF programs are mostly isolated. However,
integrating data from across CF programs has the potential for synergistic discoveries. In addition,
since CF programs have a time limit of 10 years, sustainability of the widely used CF digital
resources after the programs expire is critical. To address these challenges, the NIH established
the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) program which has been recently approved to
continue to its second new phase. For the second phase of the CFDE, this project will establish
the Data Resource Center (DRC) and the Knowledge Center (KC). Our efforts will culminate in
producing The CFDE Workbench which will be composed of three main products: the CFDE
information portal, the CFDE data resource portal, and the CFDE knowledge portal. These three
web portals will be full-stack web-based applications with a backend database and will be
integrated into one public site.
The CFDE information portal will be the entry point to the other two portals. It will contain
information about the CFDE in a dedicated About page, information about each participating and
non-participating CF program, information about each data coordination center (DCC), a link to a
catalog of CF datasets, and a link to a catalog of CF tools and workflows, news, events, funding
opportunities, standards and protocols, educational programs and opportunities, social media
feeds, and publications.
The CFDE data resource portal will contain metadata, data, workflows, and tools which are the
products of the CF programs, and their data coordination centers (DDCs). We will adopt the C2M2
data model for storing information about metadata describing DCC datasets. We will also archive
relatively small omics datasets that do not have a home in widely established repositories and do
not require PHI protection. In addition, we will expand the cataloging to CF tools, APIs, and
workflows. Importantly, we will develop a search engine that will index and present results from
all these assembled digital assets. In addition, continuing the work established in the CFDE pilot
phase, users of the data portal will be able to fetch identified datasets through links provided by
the DCCs via the DRS protocol. This will include links to raw and processed data.
The CFDE knowledge portal will provide access to CF programs processed data in various
formats including: 1) knowledge graph assertions; 2) gene, drug, metabolite, and other set
libraries; 3) data matrices ready for machine learning and other AI applications; 4) signatures; and
5) bipartite graphs. In addition, the extract, transform, and load (ETL) scripts to process the data
into these formats will be provided. Since such processed data is relatively small, we will archive
and serve this processed data, mint it with unique IDs, and serve it via APIs. In addition, we will
develop workflows that will demonstrate how the processed data can be harmonized. At the same
time, we will document APIs from all CF DCCs and provide example Jupyter Notebooks that
demonstrate how these datasets can be accessed, processed, and combined for integrative
omics analysis. For the knowledge portal we will also develop a library of tools that utilize these
processed datasets. These tools will have some uniform requirements enabling a plug-and-play
architecture.
To achieve these goals, we will work collaboratively with the other CFDE newly established
centers, the participating CFDE DCCs, the CFDE NIH team, and relevant external entities and
potential consumers of these three software products. These interactions will be achieved via
face-to-face meetings, virtual working groups meeting, one-on-one meetings, Slack, GitHub,
project management software, and e-mail exchange. Via these interactions, we will establish
standards, workstreams, feedback and mini projects towards accomplishing the goal of
developing a lively and productive Common Fund Data Ecosystem."

During nervous system development, cells and tissues often move to assemble into
layers and clusters. To do this, the cells need to generate force and transmit force to
their surroundings to push themselves forward. In vitro studies have identified a three-
step mechanism for how cells move on a substrate: cells protrude in the direction of
migration, adhere to the substrate and detach in the back. Whether cells in vivo use the
same mechanism to move is unclear because experimental limitations have hindered
similar studies. This project will address this challenge and combine a novel protein
depletion approach that offers spatial and temporal control with high resolution imaging
to ask how a tissue pushes itself forward in a living animal. For these studies, we will use
the zebrafish posterior lateral line primordium migration as a vertebrate model system
because of its amenability to powerful genetic perturbations and imaging. To reveal the
molecular basis of force generation and transmission in the migrating primordium, we
will determine how RhoA pulses are generated, how RhoA-induced cell contractions pull
cells forward, whether focal adhesions transmit the force generated through cell
contractions to the surroundings and how the surroundings respond to the friction force.
Since RhoA signaling and focal adhesion components are conserved in humans, the
proposed studies will provide necessary context to better model and understand
developmental nervous system defects and inform strategies to correct these defects."
10848741,"The fields of microbiology and immunology (M&I) have been at the epicenter of recent transformative scientific
discoveries as well as unprecedented public health challenges. Realizing a research and healthcare workforce
that reflects the diverse skills and makeup of our population is critical for the continued advancement of
innovative approaches and broad perspectives to aid in the development of M&I-based therapeutic applications
and novel antimicrobial strategies. Under-represented (UR) groups are projected to exceed 50% by 2045 but
make up just 24% of the science and engineering workforce and thus embody an underutilized talent pool that
must be drawn upon to meet the public health needs of our nation. Achieving this objective begins with exciting
UR students about microbiology and immunology as part of their undergraduate education through experiential
learning that will inspire them to pursue career paths in these fields. Towards this goal, we propose the
Supporting Under-represented Minorities in Microbiology and Immunology Research (SUMMIR) program. The
SUMMIR program will be implemented at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and leverages robust
resources across three professional schools, seven world class research institutions and centers and eight
academic departments. In a ten-week summer internship, interns will gain a comprehensive view of M&I fields
as part of an interdisciplinary training and education pipeline that spans middle school through post-graduate
education. Inter-programmatic pipeline forums and SUMMIR modules feature asset-based approaches and
leadership opportunities that allow interns to experience, first-hand, the benefits of a diverse research
environment as a key outcome of the program. In this stimulating environment, SUMMIR interns will conduct
independent mentored research projects (aim 1), engage in hands-on, active learning courses (aim 2) and
receive multifaceted mentoring support from both faculty and near-peer trainees (aim 3). Diverse cohorts of 20
interns/summer will be recruited from our pipeline programs, partnerships with local HBCUs and MSIs and
national outreach to minority-focused programs and conferences (aim 4). An innovative Laboratory Culture and
Techniques (LCT) nanocourse in the first week of the program will be held in modern teaching labs at the new
science complex of our partner institution, Towson University. The LCT will introduce fundamental concepts and
techniques that preclude a requirement for prior M&I research experience to increase program access and
diversity. All aspects of the SUMMIR program will be rigorously evaluated to assess the effectiveness of modules
in achieving their desired outcomes. Intern accomplishments and career paths provide long term metrics of
program success and will be tracked through a ResearchLogix database and a Linked-In group. These platforms,
along with bi-annual SUMMIR alumni reunions, provide the foundation for a SUMMIR professional network and
to sustain program connections. Implementation of the proposed SUMMIR program will fulfill the overarching
goal of the FOA to support educational activities that encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds to pursue
studies and careers that advance the NIAID mission and increase diversity in the larger biomedical workforce."
10889952,"ABSTRACT
Our brains have the remarkable ability to both produce precise, consistent movements in an invariant
environment and dynamically adjust behavior to a changing environment. Almost all our everyday actions, such
as driving a car or riding a bike, necessitate such flexible multi-tasking. Losing the ability to flexibly adjust
behavior is dramatic and debilitating, as evidenced by disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
or profound forms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While considerable work has examined how the brain’s
distributed motor network controls consistent movements in an invariant environment, the mechanisms that allow
for flexibility in movement control remain unknown. In this project, I develop a behavioral model to study the
flexible production of multiple distinct reaching movements in mice. The extensive previous work that has
characterized the neural control of reaching movements provides a powerful framework to precisely understand
the neural control of flexibility. I use this model to investigate the distributed control of flexible movements across
the primary motor cortex (M1), basal ganglia (BG), and cerebellum (CB). While the M1-BG and M1-CB networks
have been previously investigated in isolation, how all three regions interact is largely unexplored. I leverage (1)
large-scale multi-site neurophysiology in M1, BG, and CB, (2) genetically controlled thalamic manipulations of
M1-BG and M1-CB networks, (3) multi-region recurrent neural network models, and (4) mouse models of OCD
and ASD that display behavioral inflexibility to uncover fundamental principles by which the brain’s distributed
motor network governs flexibility in movement control and shed light on how these mechanisms dysfunction in
brain disorders."
10755314,"Atherothrombosis, resulting from rupture or erosion of unstable atherosclerotic plaques, is the leading cause of
death worldwide. However, the mechanisms that regulate the stability of late stage atherosclerotic lesions remain
poorly understood. Recent studies from our lab (2021 Nature Metabolism) showed that smooth muscle cell (SMC)
conditional knockout (KO) of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRβ) in ApoE-/- mice was associated
with nearly complete failure of SMC to invest into lesions or the fibrous cap. However, despite nearly complete
absence of SMC in lesions of SMC PDGFRβ KO mice, surprisingly we observed no changes in lesion size or indices
of plaque stability, including the thickness of the ACTA2+ fibrous cap, following 18 weeks of Western diet (WD).
Further studies showed that: 1) contrary to dogma that Acta2+ fibrous cap cells are derived almost exclusively from
SMC, we found they account for only 60-75% of ACTA2+ cells in advanced ApoE-/- brachiocephalic (BCA) or human
coronary artery (CA) lesions with the remainder coming from endothelial cell (EC)-to-mesenchymal-to-myofibroblast
transitions (EndoMT-MFT, 15-20%) and macrophage-to-myofibroblast transitions (MMFT, 10-15%); 2) loss of SMC
investment into lesions with SMC PDGFR? KO or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was associated with a 2-3 fold
increase in EndoMT-MFT and MMFT; 3) increased EndoMT-MFT, and MMFT did not sustain indices of stability when
WD feeding was extended to 26 weeks suggesting qualitative differences in the ability of fibrous cap cells to sustain
lesion stability depending on their origin; 4) the contribution of EC to the ACTA2+ fibrous cap increased with lesion
regression by feeding mice 18 weeks of WD followed by 12 weeks of chow diet; and 5) female but not male mice
exhibit IL1R1-dependent EndoMT. Studies herein will test the hypothesis that the contribution of EC to the ACTA2+
fibrous cap increases with lethal irradiation-BMT, SMC PDGFRβ KO, aging, female sex, and/or plaque regression
resulting in: 1) increased EC proliferation and replicative senescence; 2) loss of EC integrity and/or reduced anti-
thrombotic properties; and 3) increased susceptibility to plaque erosion or rupture. Aim 1 will determine if the marked
increase in the contribution of EndoMT-MFT to the ACTA2+ fibrous cap following lethal irradiation-BMT, SMC
PDGFR? KO, or with plaque regression is associated with increased proliferation, clonal expansion, replicative
senescence, and/or dysfunction of EC. Aim 2 will determine if treatment of our SMC- or EC-lineage tracing ApoE-/-
or our novel Myh11-CreERT2/Rosa-eYFP/SR-BIΔCT/ΔCT/LDLR- (ΔCT) mice with advanced BCA and CA lesions with
senolytic drugs is associated with beneficial changes in indices of plaque stability, improved survival, reduced MI or
stroke, reduced dependence on EndoMT-MFT for maintenance of the ACTA2+ fibrous cap, and/or improved EC
integrity and/or function. All aims include human validation studies on stable versus high risk carotid endarterectomy
samples, and assessment of sex-dependent determinants of late-stage lesion pathogenesis. The proposed studies
will provide novel insights regarding mechanisms that regulate the cellular and extracellular matrix (ECM) composition
of the fibrous cap and may lead to development of novel therapeutic approaches for enhancing plaque stability."
10832624,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
What operations are performed by the mammalian central nervous systems to coordinate and conduct 
voluntary movement? Motor systems neuroscience seeks to understand these neural mechanisms. The 
last two decades have witnessed a transformation in this field with the use of multielectrode recordings 
and statistical estimation and modeling techniques. These technological advances have yielded rich, 
low-dimensional neural dynamics that are suggestive of the mechanisms underlying behavior. To
minimize confounds, the overwhelming majority of these studies utilize behavioral constraint to isolate just 
the behaviors of interest for study. While effective for generating many behaviorally similar trials, this may 
have the unintentional consequence of artificially constraining neural dynamics to a subset of its full
range.
This project seeks to better understand the full repertoire of behavior in a freely-moving setting and model 
this neural activity using novel computational tools. This project combines the expertise of two 
neuroscientists with complemenary skillsets spanning systems and computational neuroscience. This 
project will involve acquiring novel, freely-moving data using the recent advances in depth imaging 
cameras and modeling the dynamics of the labelled neural data with innovative switching dynamical 
models.
TThis combined expertise will be applied to the investigation of the initiation vs sustaining of movement, 
the decomposition of walking periods into distinct dynamical regimes, and an analysis of foraging 
behavior.
Taken together, these studies will further our understanding of how neural dynamics drive unconstrained 
motor behavior. This insight has implications for the development of ambulatory brain-machine interfaces 
and may inform the treatment of individuals with motor disorders such as stroke."
10833128,"Project Summary
 This proposal describes investigations in three main areas to understand how the organization of
chromosomes in the nucleus, and their differentiation into heterochromatin and euchromatin, impacts
chromosome breakage and repair, chromosome pairing, and chromosome replication in Drosophila
melanogaster. In the first part, dicentric chromosomes are generated in the male germline, where they typically
break, delivering a chromosome with a broken end to each daughter cell. The influence of structurally distinct
centromeres and the amount of centromeric histone CenpA on the fate of these chromosomes will be examined.
Experiments will be undertaken to understand how cells with a broken chromosome choose their fate, to repair
or to die, and how they choose between different modes of repair. These choices have obvious relevance for
human health. When a cell lives, but fails to repair damage, it may become cancerous. The mode of repair can
determine whether gametes transmit a normal genome, or a genome with deficiencies or other structural variants
or mutations. One particular mode of repair, Break Induced Replication, is known to be mutagenic in yeast, and
has been implicated in chromosome change in humans. Chromosomes repaired by BIR will be examined to
determine the types and frequencies of mutations produced in the germline of a higher eukaryote.
 In the second part of this work, the mechanism of mitotic chromosome pairing will be examined.
Significant progress has been made in identifying genes that promote or inhibit pairing, but how homologous
regions of chromosomes find each other to initiate pairing is still a mystery. This work will test various models for
the initiation of pairing by studying the frequency of site-specific recombination within and between rearranged
chromosomes. This work also has human health relevance, since failures of meiotic pairing can lead to gametes
with chromosomal aneuploidy. Some cancer cells also show inappropriate homologous pairing, implying a
possible connection between these chromosome and cellular states.
 In the third part of the proposed work, the timing of DNA replication in heterochromatin will be examined.
Mutations in genes that encode proteins that affect heterochromatin will be tested to determine their effects on
replication timing. Proper maintenance of heterochromatin is important for genome stability, and disruption of its
normal pattern of replication can lead to altered gene expression, with impacts on cellular function and health."
10833129,"Project Summary/Abstract
Background: A major challenge in evolutionary genomics is to characterize the forces shaping present-day
patterns of genetic variation. For instance, the extent and manner in which natural selection affects genetic
diversity remains highly controversial. Researchers have largely addressed this problem by developing
statistical tests or summaries of genome sequence variation that provide insights into the evolutionary forces at
play. However, because such approaches typically rely on a single univariate summary of the data, valuable
discriminatory information present in the original dataset is lost. A more fruitful strategy would thus be to use
multidimensional summaries of genomic data (e.g. a large vector of summary statistics) or even the totality of
the input data (e.g. a matrix-representation of a sequence alignment) to make more accurate inferences. An
even more powerful approach is to utilize data sets in which the same population is sampled at multiple time
points, allowing one to observe evolutionary dynamics in action. Although such genomic time-series data are
becoming more prevalent, the development of appropriate computational methodologies has lagged behind
the proliferation of such data.
Proposal: The Schrider Lab seeks to develop and apply powerful machine learning methods for evolutionary
inference. Our work over the next five years will yield powerful software tools leveraging novel representations
of genomic datasets, including time-series data. These efforts will dramatically improve researchers' ability to
make accurate evolutionary inferences from both population genomic and phylogenetic data. Indeed,
preliminary results demonstrate that our methods vastly outperform current approaches in evolutionary
genetics. More importantly, we will use these tools to answer pressing evolutionary questions. In particular, our
use of time-series data will reveal loci responsible for recent adaptation with much greater confidence than
currently possible. Our efforts will help to resolve the controversy over the role of adaptation in shaping
patterns of diversity across the human genome. This research has important implications for public health
as well, as genes underlying recent adaptations are enriched for disease-associations. Moreover, we are
constructing a time-series dataset in the mosquito vector species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. We will
interrogate these data for evidence of recent and ongoing adaptation—this work will reveal loci responsible
for the evolution of resistance to insecticides and other control efforts. Encouraging preliminary data also
suggest that our work in phylogenetics will substantially improve inferential power in this important research
area. More broadly, the success of the novel approaches described in this proposal has the potential to
transform the methodological landscape of evolutionary genomic data analysis."

deep-learning algorithms. Dr. Wardi has assembled a diverse team of collaborative experts to support his
career development and mentor him consisting of Dr. Atul Malhotra, an internationally recognized expert in
critical care physiology and respiratory failure along with Dr. Shamim Nemati, a machine-learning expert with a
strong focus in prediction of sepsis in real-time. Additionally, his training team includes experts in
implementation science from the Dissemination and Implementation Science Center (DISC) at UCSD as well
as an expert in clinical trial design and biostatistics (Dr. Sonia Jain). Despite decades of research, sepsis
remains a major public health challenge. Current approaches to sepsis care emphasize “one-size fits all”
bundles that may result in patient harm in certain subgroups. Newer approaches to data analysis, using
multiple layers of non-linear arithmetic operations now allow for clustering of sepsis patients into novel clinical
phenotypes that may provide for more personalized care. The PI will evaluate potential phenotypes of sepsis
not present on admission (NPOA) in Aim 1. Prior investigations into phenotyping have been developed and
validated in patients present in the emergency department. Patients with sepsis NPOA have high mortality and
better quantification of phenotypes may help improve care by identifying novel groups. Dr. Wardi seeks to
evaluate 2 inter-related hypotheses in this aim: one is that phenotypes may represent disease trajectories that
are modifiable by accepted therapies (e.g. time to, and quantity of fluid resuscitation). The second is that novel
phenotypes exist in the inpatient setting. In his second aim, Dr. Wardi seeks to determine clinical mechanisms
of 30-day readmissions in sepsis patients through a variety of approaches, including identification of novel
clusters of sepsis patients at discharge and use of natural language processing of a large data set to identify
actionable reasons for readmissions. Finally, he seeks to determine if the application of a wearable patch to
sepsis patients discharged to a long-term acute care hospital when combined with a machine-learning
algorithm may reduce unanticipated 30-day sepsis readmissions. This research and career development plan
affords Dr. Wardi an impressive foundation to develop into a prominent clinician-scientist working to improve
care by developing and implementing novel approaches to detection and classification of sepsis patients. Dr.
Wardi is fully committed to improving the care of sepsis patients by embracing innovative strategies."

Reductions in the health burden of tobacco and other substance use and of overdose mortality have not been
equitably distributed. A minority of persons with substance use disorder (SUD) access treatment. To improve
the equity in the delivery of evidence-based treatment of opioid-, tobacco- and other SUD, rigorous training is
needed to prepare the next generation of investigators in patient-oriented addictions research (POAR). I am a
general internist who has provided integrated primary care and opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment for over
16 years, co-direct fellowship programs to train general internists skills in SUD clinical care and research, and
lead a research program that aims to enhance tobacco treatment outcomes and delivery among persons with
co-occurring mental health and SUD. This Mid-Career Investigator Award will be used to support three
overarching career goals. First, this will formalize and expand my research mentoring activity to fellows and
early-career faculty focused on POAR. I will focus particularly on mentoring investigators from racial/ethnic
minority groups that are underrepresented in academic medicine and NIH-funded research. Second, I will
develop specific expertise in experimental and implementation science methods to enhance intervention
optimization and translation of clinical research findings to real-world application. The proposed research will
use a stakeholder-informed approach to develop and pilot test a flexible methadone treatment intervention.
This will both inform flexible, patient-centered, equitable care delivery in OUD treatment, and provide a
platform for research training for mentees in experimental and implementation science. Finally, I will develop
leadership skills in academic medicine to expand the research training infrastructure to promote equity and
diversity, and enhance research training in POAR. The proposed K24 application will leverage my strong
existing research program, an outstanding team of advisors, and robust institutional resources in research and
clinical care among persons with mental illness and SUD to support my career development and mentorship of
early-career investigators."

Abnormal activity of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) leads to increased and untimely release of Ca2+ from
the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), driving Ca2+-dependent arrhythmogenesis that can lead to sudden death in
many cardiac disorders. Oxidative modification of RyR2 by reactive oxygen species (ROS) has long been
established to enhance the sensitivity of the channels to Ca2+ within the SR (intraluminal Ca2+) in the failing heart.
However, both the intracellular source of ROS, as well as the specific redox-sensitive residues of RyR2 which
control intraluminal Ca2+ sensitivity, remain elusive. Our initial studies implicate the role of the SR oxidoreductase
system in this control, whereby molecular chaperones and enzymes that facilitate protein folding also modulate
activity of RyR2. We have identified intraluminal cysteines of RyR2 that elicit functional effects on the channel,
as well as an oxidoreductase chaperone that associates with the channel in a redox-dependent manner.
Moreover, we found upregulation of oxidoreductase enzyme in rodent models of cardiac disease, and observed
RyR2 activity stabilization with pharmacological inhibition of this enzyme. We therefore hypothesize that
dysregulation of the SR oxidoreductase system impairs luminal Ca2+ regulation of RyR2 via an ‘intraluminal SR
redox sensor’ and promotes arrhythmogenesis. We will test our hypothesis by 1) defining the molecular
components of the SR redox sensor that control luminal Ca2+ sensitivity of RyR2, and 2) determining the role of
dysregulated SR redox homeostasis in Ca2+-dependent arrhythmogenesis. To address these aims, we will
employ a multilevel experimental approach, investigating at the molecular, cellular, and whole heart level. We
propose to use heterologous systems, biochemical approaches and human induced pluripotent stem cell
cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) technology to identify the RyR2 redox sensor. We also propose to study disease-
associated perturbations of the SR oxidoreductase system in rodent models of inherited and acquired Ca2+-
dependent arrhythmia, utilizing novel genetic biosensors, as well as adenoviral (AV) and adeno-associated viral
(AAV) gain- and loss- of function approaches. With renowned experts in cardiac EC coupling, protein
biochemistry and hiPSC-CM technology, The Ohio State University offers an exceptional training environment
for the mentored phase of the award to reach these goals. Furthermore, building on my strong background in
molecular biology, I will collaborate with an expert in CRISPR-mediated gene editing of hiPSC-CMs to study
these mechanisms in a relevant human model. The achievement of the proposed aims will uncover novel
regulatory mechanisms of RyR2 regulation, with potential to be therapeutically exploited. This proposal therefore
addresses a fruitful and unexplored research area, relevant to a spectrum of cardiovascular diseases, which will
lay strong foundations for an independent research career in cardiovascular physiology."

CANDIDATE. I am a physician and Instructor in the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). A K08 Award will provide me with the necessary training and
experience to become an independent investigator in germ cell (GC) biology, with a focus on the gene
regulatory networks underlying human gametogenesis.
BACKGROUND. How a small subset of cells in the developing human and non-human primate embryo
acquires competency to form the germ line and ultimately mature into functional gametes while maintaining its
potential for pluripotency is among the least understood questions in biology. In particular, the gene regulatory
networks and epigenetic remodeling, which govern competence for the GC fate during specification of early
(primordial) germ cells (PGCs) in the peri-gastrulating period, remain unknown. Knowledge of the underlying
mechanisms will allow the development of more efficient differentiation protocols for GCs from pluripotent stem
cells (PSCs) in vitro. In addition, it will allow the investigation of the link between epigenetic dysregulation
during GC specification and critical human disorders such as pregnancy loss, congenital defects and common
late-onset diseases such as infertility, diabetes, drug addiction and cancer.
RESEARCH. The objective for this K08 is to identify and validate the key gene regulatory elements (GREs)
governing induction of competence for the GC fate and the differentiation of PGCs during cynomolgus
gastrulation. Our central hypothesis is that epigenetic priming of key GREs in incipient mesoderm mediates
developmental competence during germ lineage specification from the pluripotent state. This research will
pursue two specific aims: (1) to identify putative GREs underlying developmental competence for the GC fate
through epigenetic footprinting (2) to identify the subset of these GREs functioning as key determinants of GC
competence and differentiation using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) and CRISPR epigenome
editing mediated loss of function experiments. In the future, these results will provide the platform to use
epigenome editing as a tool to improve the efficiency of GC specification, for trans-differentiation of GCs from
somatic cells and to study the effect of epimutations on developmental outcomes in GCs and embryos using
animal models.
MENTORING. My primary mentor, Dr. Kevin Eggan, is an expert in stem cell biology at the Harvard Stem Cell
Center. I have assembled a multi-disciplinary mentoring team across the Harvard network: Dr. Alex Meissner
(an expert in epigenetics and epigenomics), Dr. Steve McCarroll (a leader in genomics and bioinformatics).
TRAINING. The research objectives are supported by a training plan that includes hands-on lab training as
well as formal and hands-on didactics in bioinformatics and the analysis of large genomic datasets alongside a
strong institutional commitment at BIDMC and the grant review and support program through Harvard Catalyst."
10928214,"Sleep deficiency, characterized by short sleep duration, poor sleep quality, and symptoms of insomnia, is a
significant public health concern in the US. Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder but is generally
undertreated. Black women have a high prevalence of clinically significant insomnia, which is associated with
the risk for cardiometabolic disease and early mortality. However, there is a dearth of sleep interventions and
implementation efforts for Black women. There is a growing interest in the influence of structural racism on
downstream social and health inequalities, suggesting health disparities as “a special case of implementation
failure.” The time lag between research discovery and uptake of evidence-based intervention is even more
inflated in Black communities. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to achieve health- and healthcare
equity by implementing an evidence-based, equity-focused sleep intervention to reduce stress and sleep
deficiency-related cardiometabolic disease burden in Black communities. Mindfulness-based therapy for
insomnia (MBTI) is an evidence-based stress management program using mindfulness meditation and
behavioral therapy for insomnia. The efficacy of MBTI on stress reduction and sleep deficiency has been shown
in multiple meta-analyses in the general population. Findings from our pilot MBTI study were also aligned with
the evidence. Evaluating the effectiveness of MBTI and developing equity-focused implementation strategies
that address social determinants of health (SDoH), unique to Black women, are urgently needed to achieve sleep
health equity. To address gaps in implementation science, we propose a study guided by the NIMHD Research
Framework and Equity-focused Implementation Research Framework through a community participatory
approach. In phases 1 and 2, we will identify multi-level barriers and facilitators to implementing the online MBTI
through an equity lens using community-engaged research with key stakeholders. Then, we will develop and
refine equity-focused implementation strategies with the community advisory board, comprised of community-
based organization members, African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church networks, clinicians, and community
health workers (CHWs). In phase 3, we will use a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness/implementation design with a
pragmatic randomized controlled trial with MBTI and a waitlist control in Black women with insomnia. CHWs as
SDoH specialists will assess and address social needs of Black women, and registered nurses will deliver the
online MBTI intervention in the community settings. We will evaluate effectiveness- (insomnia severity reduction/
remission) and implementation (acceptability, feasibility, fidelity, cost, contextual factors, and sustainability)
outcomes. The study will contribute to equity-focused implementation science and policy decisions by providing
multi-level implementation determinants, equity-relevant metrics, and contextual factors through community-
engaged research and evaluation of the outcomes."

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a multi-functional cytokine. Our previous studies reveal that LIF is a
direct target gene of tumor suppressor p53 and mediates the function of p53 in maternal reproduction, and
at the same time, LIF forms a negative feedback loop with p53 to inhibit p53 function in tumor suppression.
LIF has a complex role in tumorigenesis; LIF has been reported to suppress or promote tumorigenesis in
different types of cancers. Emerging evidence, including ours, has shown that LIF is frequently
overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC). Further, LIF overexpression is often associated with poor
prognosis in CRC patients. These observations strongly suggest a critical role of LIF in promoting colorectal
tumorigenesis. Currently, the precise role and mechanism of LIF in colorectal tumorigenesis are poorly
defined. Colorectal tumor-initiating stem-like cells (TICs) play a critical role in CRC initiation, progression
and resistance to therapy. Eliminating TICs has been actively tested as a therapeutic strategy for CRC.
Our recent study shows that LIF is present in the intestinal stem cells (ISC) niche and is essential to
maintain ISC number and functions. Oncogenic activation in ISCs plays a critical role in the initiation of
CRC. Our preliminary studies further suggest that LIF drives lipid metabolic reprogramming of colorectal
TICs as an important mechanism whereby LIF promotes colorectal TIC number and functions. These
findings prompt us to hypothesize that LIF is essential for colorectal TIC number and functions, which in
turn promotes colorectal tumorigenesis. We further hypothesize that targeting LIF and LIF-driven
metabolic reprogramming can suppress colorectal TICs and inhibit colorectal tumorigenesis. In this
proposed study, we will determine the role of LIF in colorectal tumorigenesis and colorectal TIC number
and functions by using different mouse models (Aim 1). We will determine whether increasing colorectal
TIC number and functions through LIF-driven lipid metabolic reprograming is a critical mechanism whereby
LIF promotes colorectal tumorigenesis. We will investigate whether LIF regulates the levels and activities
of critical transcription factors involved in lipid metabolism in colorectal TICs, including p53, to drive lipid
metabolic reprogramming (Aim 2A). We will further test whether the LIF-driven metabolic reprogramming
can be targeted for CRC therapy (Aim 2B). The goal of this study is to elucidate the role and mechanism
of LIF in CRC, and assess whether targeting LIF-driven lipid metabolic reprogramming is an effective
strategy to eliminate TICs and treat CRC with LIF overexpression. If accomplished successfully, this study
will establish the critical role of LIF in CRC, reveal its underlying mechanisms, and provide the rationale
and base for the development of new therapeutic targets and strategies for CRC with LIF overexpression."

Overview and Goals: The goal of the CPC program is to apply the expertise of behavioral, basic, and clinician 
scientists to conduct innovative and impactful cancer research that reduces Colorado's cancer burden. Program 
members work to improve population health, change clinical practice, and improve outcomes with a focus on 
approaches that reduce disparities associated with race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and rural/frontier 
residence. CPC brings together outstanding transdisciplinary, well-funded scientists with strengths from basic 
science through public health. Research Highlights: CPC conducts innovative and impactful research across 
many cancers, including lung, breast, colorectal, melanoma, and pancreatic relevant to cancer burden and 
disparities within the catchment. Using lung cancer research examples from each program aim, CPC members 
pioneered a chemoprevention approach to reverse endobronchial dysplasia (Aim 1). CPC members 
demonstrated the efficacy of a novel approach to improve quality of life and well-being among individuals 
diagnosed with lung and head/neck cancer (Aim 2). Leveraging the Population Health Shared Resource (PHSR), 
CPC members identified significant rural-urban disparities in uptake of innovative antineoplastic agents for 
metastatic lung cancer, demonstrating CPC expertise in health disparities research (Aim 3). Program Activities: 
CPC co-leaders, Agarwal and Studts, utilize support provided by UCCC to host annual retreats, monthly 
seminars, and ad hoc mini-retreats to facilitate intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations. Programmatic 
funding also supports pilot grants for mentored members and stimulates research in targeted areas that align 
with the catchment and health disparities. Members: The program has 41 Full and 13 mentored members with 
$2.8M NCI and $3.9M of other cancer peer-reviewed research grant funding in 2020. Members are from 34 
departments and 6 schools, and most members hold primary affiliations with University of Colorado Anschutz 
Medical Campus (UCAMC), University of Colorado Boulder (UCB) and Colorado State University (CSU). CPC 
members published 494 cancer-focused publications in 2016-2020, 13% published in journals with an impact 
factor ≥10, and 33% published in journals with an impact factor of ≥5. With extensive collaborations across 
programs, 216 (44%) of CPC publications were either inter-programmatic (29%), intra-programmatic (20%) or 
both (5%); and 167 (34%) constitute collaborations with other NCI-designated cancer center members. Future 
Directions: In concert with the UCCC strategic plan, CPC leadership seeks to accelerate the CPC growth 
trajectory in scientific impact, collaboration, research, community engagement, and training. CPC will pursue five 
specific future directions related to (1) translating and expanding chemoprevention; (2) escalating clinical 
research in behavioral oncology; (3) enhancing health equity research; (4) enriching implementation science in 
cancer and (5) expanding graduate and post-graduate training in rural and frontier cancer prevention and control."

The goal of the Developmental Therapeutics (DT) program is to translate basic scientific discovery to clinical 
application to benefit patients of all ages, improving the quality of life for patients in the catchment area and 
beyond. Members develop, test, and institute novel therapies in adult and pediatric patients with solid and 
hematologic malignancies and lead collaborative, multi-institutional initiatives to establish new treatment 
paradigms. The DT program serves the catchment area by improving access to care, and training the next 
generation of cancer researchers, focusing on mentoring early-career faculty. The DT program had two added 
points of focus as a result of the prior review: 1) enhancing investigator-initiated trials (IITs) by developing the 
IIT incubator and prioritizing IITs in early-phase trial and disease-specific groups, particularly those developed 
by mentored members. As a result, accruals to intervention treatment IITs increased 3-fold from 47 in 2016 to 
140 in 2020. And 2) enhancing preclinical xenograft development to foster immunobiology/immunotherapy 
discovery. DT funded pilot grants producing orphan disease PDXs, humanized models (HM) for colorectal 
cancer, and an autologous HM in melanoma. With 78 members representing 18 departments and 4 schools, DT 
holds $3.2M in NCI, $2.0M in other NIH, and $2.8M in other peer-reviewed funding, a 50% increase in peer- 
reviewed research funding from $5.4M in 2016 to $8.0M in 2020. Since 2016, DT members enrolled 2688 
subjects to 641 intervention treatment trials, an increase of 29%. DT members published 1000 peer-reviewed 
cancer-related papers, of which 48% were collaborative (15% inter-; 17% intra-; 16% both) and 24% in journals 
with an IF>10. Forty-seven percent (47%) of these represent collaborations with other NCI-designated cancer 
centers. University of Colorado Cancer Center (UCCC) educational activities, training/career enhancement 
activities, and shared resources (SRs) support are foundational to the DT's priorities of funding pilot grants that 
emphasize “homegrown” therapies and bench-to-bedside application of discoveries. These investments led to 
successful program project collaborations and multiple-PI funding across the UCCC. DT continues to expand 
multi-stakeholder partnerships within UCCC and with key partners, including the University of Colorado Boulder 
(UCB), Colorado State University (CSU), University of Colorado Hospital (UCH), Children's Hospital Colorado 
(CHCO), and the Veterans Administration (VA). UCH, CHCO, and the VA utilize a unified and shared Institutional 
Review Board, enabling a robust and compliant system to apply DT program discoveries and benefit patients in 
the catchment area, while streamlining access for patients. The DT program continues to focus on advancing 
novel compounds developed within UCCC by supporting pilot projects, using the NIH Research Evaluation and 
Commercialization Hubs (REACH) program, supporting start-ups, and encouraging SBIR applications. Lastly, 
the DT program has fostered strategic recruitments to strengthen its membership to better integrate pediatric, 
adult, and companion animal models, impacting patient care across the spectrum of cancer."

Overview and Goals: The goal of the Molecular and Cellular Oncology (MCO) program is to perform in-depth 
mechanistic studies in pursuit of critical basic science knowledge that can be applied towards effective cancer 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The expertise of program members is broad and deep, with major strengths 
in genome instability, gene expression and epigenetic regulation, DNA damage responses, telomeres, pathways 
controlling cell fate, and elucidation of cancer-relevant molecular structures. Research Highlights: Bench-to- 
bedside team science uncovered metabolic vulnerabilities of leukemia stem cells and contributed to a new 
therapy combination of BCL-2 inhibitor Venetoclax with standard chemotherapy that produces deep and durable 
remissions (Cancer Cell, 2018 [1,2]; Nature Medicine, 2018 [3]) and the finding that adding autophagy inhibitor 
chloroquine to BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib reduced inhibitor resistance for brain cancer patients (Elife, 2017 [4]; 
PNAS, 2018 [5]). Program Activities: To accomplish its goals, MCO co-leaders employ resources provided by 
the University of Colorado Cancer Center (UCCC) to encourage and enable intra- and inter-programmatic 
collaborations through organization of annual retreats and technology forums as well as fostering transdisciplinary 
collaborations. Assisted by UCCC support, the co-leaders catalyze new research by MCO members through the 
creation and expansion of Shared Resources (SR), by providing pilot funding to use these technologies, while 
leveraging resources and research strengths of collaborating institutions. Through coordinated transdisciplinary 
collaborations between MCO members and translational/clinical research programs, the discoveries made in 
MCO move from bench to preclinical investigations and clinical trials, which ultimately improve diagnosis, 
treatment, and prevention of cancer. Members: The program has 56 full and 13 mentored members with $ 4.7M 
NCI and $9.0M of other cancer peer-reviewed research funding. Members are from 13 basic science and clinical 
departments at UCAMC, UCB, CSU and National Jewish Health (NJH). Since July 2016, MCO members 
published 476 cancer-focused publications, of which 245 (51%) were either inter-programmatic (45%), intra- 
programmatic (17%), or both (11%); (27%) were in journals with an IF ≥10; and 130 (27%) represented 
collaborations with investigators at other NCI cancer centers. Future Directions: Through retreats/forums, seed 
grants, and support of relevant SRs, MCO plans to enhance current strengths in the cross-cutting research 
themes cancer and metabolism and cancer and aging. To promote collaborative translational research of 
relevance to the catchment, MCO members are collaborating with the UCCC Office of Community Outreach and 
Engagement to mine patient databases from the Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine for cancer-relevant 
genomic information in underserved populations in Colorado. Findings will be shared with MCO members to 
stimulate catchment-relevant cancer research. These efforts will advance the discovery of basic cancer 
processes and their translation into improved cancer prevention and treatment."

Overview and Goals: The goals of the Tumor Host Interactions (THI) Program are to understand both tumor 
intrinsic (Aim 1) and extrinsic (Aim 2) conditions of the host that impact tumor initiation, progression and 
therapeutic response, and to harness this information using translational pre-clinical studies and clinical trials 
(Aim 3). THI investigators use expertise in tumor immunology, the tumor microenvironment, and physiology to 
understand and exploit tumor/host crosstalk, such as tumor-stroma interactions, tumor infiltrating immune cells, 
heme- and lymph-angiogenesis, endocrine influences on components of the microenvironment and site-specific 
niches. Research Highlights: Research in Aim 1 demonstrates the role of IL-1 in inflammatory cancers by 
creating a new IL-1R3 antibody, that blocks 6 different IL-1 family cytokines and shows significant activity in 
preclinical models (Nat Immunol, 2019 [14]). Exemplifying Aim 2, collaborative research uncovered a novel role 
of Sema7a in the initiation and progression of postpartum breast cancer (Cancer Res, 2018 [29], Front Immunol, 
2019 [30]). This work also identified PDL1 as a potential target for postpartum breast cancer (Oncogene, 2020 
[31], Cancer Res, 2020 [32]). In Aim 3, partnerships between the University of Colorado Cancer Center (UCCC) 
basic researchers, clinical facilities (Children's Hospital and University Hospital) and the good manufacturing 
production facility create an infrastructure for the production and safe clinical testing of first-in-human cellular 
therapy. An investigator-initiated clinical trial testing a unique CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T product 
in adults and children is open and a CD19xCD22 product will be tested in Q1, 2021. Program Activities: THI 
co-leaders employ resources provided by the UCCC to host annual retreats aimed at facilitating intra- and inter- 
programmatic, multi-investigator collaborations. Programmatic funding is allocated for such efforts, as well as 
seed grants for junior faculty (many UCCC mentored members). Members: THI has 51 full and 11 mentored 
members with $4.4M NCI and $7.4M of other peer-reviewed cancer research funding in 2020. Members are from 
20 basic science and clinical departments at UCCC affiliated campuses. Since 2016, THI members produced 
476 cancer-focused publications, of which 256 (54%) were either inter-programmatic (48%), intra-programmatic 
(21%), or both (16%); and 162 (54%) represented collaborations with investigators at other NCI cancer centers. 
Eighteen percent (18%) are in journals with impact factor of 10 or greater. Future Directions: THI will support 
pilot projects that utilize specialized instrumentation such as CyTOF, MIBI and multispectral imaging that the 
UCCC invested in to support basic and translational THI studies investigating the tumor microenvironment. 
Through retreats and strategic workshops, seed grants, and support from relevant SRs, THI will enhance 
research on the UCCC cross-cutting themes of metabolism and aging in cancer, as well as other tumor intrinsic 
and extrinsic cell types. THI will collaborate with COE to further understand relevant issues to the catchment, 
support collaborative science via pilot funding and grow the cellular therapy pipeline for clinical translation."

The University of Colorado Cancer Center (UCCC) catchment area is the State of Colorado (104,185 square 
miles and 5,842,076 people). In 2020, 27,290 Coloradans were diagnosed with cancer and over 8,000 died. 
UCCC analyzed data from the Colorado Central Cancer Registry and from local and national databases to 
characterize Colorado's cancer burden, risks, and disparities and to establish priorities. Priority areas include (a) 
burden from the top five incident and mortality cancers; (b) disparity populations (i.e., rural, Hispanic, poor); and 
(c) cancer risk factors (i.e., smoking, HPV infection, environmental exposures, low screening rates). The mission 
of the Office of Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) is to provide scientific direction and planning for 
UCCC efforts to conduct research and activities to address the priority areas and positively impact Coloradans. 
The COE also links UCCC state-of-the-art investigations with the needs and priorities of Colorado's communities. 
To address each priority area, COE has three overarching aims: (1) provide comprehensive up-to-date data, (2) 
facilitate and align basic, clinical, translational, and population health research with priorities, and (3) engage 
communities in science, education, dissemination/implementation, and advocacy. First, upon characterizing the 
catchment and setting priorities, COE led three community health assessments to gather baseline data to inform 
our work and further measure short and long-term progress on priorities. Second, COE built the infrastructure to 
align the UCCC programmatic research with the priorities and to link investigators with key community partners. 
Third, COE facilitates multiple service and research projects to educate and engage communities in cancer 
prevention, control, treatment, and survivorship efforts to reduce Colorado's cancer burden, risks, and disparities. 
These three aims are supported by five P30 supplements, as well as institutional funding for COE. To advance 
the work, COE facilitates research projects (e.g., R01), state-funded service projects, and pilot studies conducted 
by basic, clinical, translational, and population health investigators. COE conducts outreach and engagement 
activities to improve community participation in cancer research, education, and advocacy. UCCC has strong 
and well-established partnerships with stakeholders from government, employers, coalitions, advocacy and faith- 
based organizations, and state-wide healthcare systems. The 15 members of the Community Advisory Council 
(CAC) represent organizations that care for underserved populations in Colorado, as well as the Lieutenant 
Governor of Colorado – a multiple cancer survivor. To advance impact beyond Colorado, UCCC established the 
4-Corners Collaborative with the NCI-designated cancer centers in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. The 
collaborative identifies and addresses priority cancers and disparity populations common to the 4-corners states. 
For future directions, COE will strengthen and pursue the following: (1) enhance the cancer disparities research 
conducted by UCCC programs; (2) engage more patients from disparity populations in translational science; and 
(3) extend UCCC's reach of research, advocacy, and policy to more communities within and beyond Colorado."

Overview and Goals: CCSG Developmental Funds are used with the goal of supporting the pursuit of new 
scientific opportunities that, when properly selected, enhance UCCC research activities. In the current grant 
period, CCSG Developmental Funds were used to develop the Population Health Shared Resource (PHSR) to 
integrate population science research across UCCC programs. Since its inception, the PHSR has provided 
service to 42 investigators, 81% of whom were UCCC members representing all UCCC programs. The PHSR 
provides access to data, tools, and analysts to support multiple areas of research and strategic initiatives 
including Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) and Cancer Research Training and Education 
Coordination (CRTEC). The PHSR supports the curation and manipulation of national, regional, and local 
databases pertaining to cancer surveillance, cancer care delivery and outcomes as well as federal and regional, 
surveys describing cancer risk, prevention, and early detection behavior; and it employs analysts with expertise 
to employ qualitative and quantitative research methods—study design and implementation that includes focus 
groups, key informant interviews, patient-reported measurement selection, and survey development and 
implementation. Future Directions: Over the next 5 years UCCC proposes to use CCSG Developmental Funds 
to support pilot grants to foster collaborative and exceptional research opportunities that deepen inter and intra- 
programmatic collaborations and promote successful, multi-project, sponsored research grant applications. 
Projects will be selected based on merit in addition to their potential to leverage existing strengths and capabilities 
and translate these into innovations that are likely to lead to external funding and subsequent major advances 
in cancer medicine. Use of funds and progress on proposed objectives will be monitored closely to help ensure 
success of the efforts to secure three to five new multi-project grants over the next funding period. In summary, 
this program will seek to promote team science and leverage institutional strengths and resources to expand the 
breadth of UCCC research through the establishment of new collaborative, multi-project grant programs."

Overview: The Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) provides central administration and oversight 
functions for coordinating, facilitating, and reporting on clinical and population sciences trials across the UCCC 
clinical sites serving the catchment. The Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) provides a robust 
structure for auditing clinical trials across the UCCC partner sites. DSMC's oversight is prioritized for high-risk 
Phase I and Phase II protocols. Accomplishments: Since 2016, the CPDM substantially improved clinical 
research support as follows: 1) Investigator-initiated trial (IIT) support leading to a 411% increase in IIT accruals 
from 2017-2020 compared to the previous similar period of 2013-2016; 2) Development of the Oncology Clinical 
Research Support Team (OCRST). OCRST provides centralized SOP development, staff and investigator 
training, multi-site coordination, and streamlining of processes for the successful implementation of clinical 
research protocols across the network; 3) Expansion of the Front Range Clinical Trials Network (FRCTN) 
provides clinical trial access to the population of Colorado. The inclusion of 5 UCHealth System clinical research 
sites in the FRCTN presents an enormous opportunity for clinical and population health research given the size 
and diversity of the socioeconomic demographics of the population and its rural/urban mix; 4) CPDM and 
UCHealth implemented the Via Oncology Pathways across the UCHealth system with clinical trials built into the 
pathways to ensure awareness and access to UCCC clinical trials across the catchment area. Quality Control 
and Training: The CPDM initiated an educational curriculum to provide a cohesive and relevant training 
structure to new staff and faculty and ongoing education to ensure those involved in the conduct of clinical 
investigation remain knowledgeable of policies and regulations. A new curriculum was developed that utilizes 
educational resources within the UCCC, UCAMC, the Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute 
(CCTSI, UL1TR001082) and enhanced by feedback received from trial audits. Trials and Catchment Area 
Demographics: The CPDM oversees an annual average of 527 clinical research studies. In FY2020, 608 
patients were accrued to intervention-treatment studies. Patients seen at UCCC come from all 64 Colorado 
counties. Based on data from 2020, patient accruals were consistent with the state cancer demographics. UCCC 
has a plan to increase Hispanic enrollment to at least 10% and improve clinical trial access to the population at 
large. Taken together, these data demonstrate substantial progress in the CPDM and further demonstrate the 
UCCC's commitment to patients with cancer."

The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) of the University of Colorado Cancer Center (UCCC) is an 
integral component of the clinical research performed at UCCC. PRMS functions for cancer clinical trials across 
the UCCC include: 1) review of scientific merit prior to submission to an Institutional Review Board (IRB); 2) 
assessment of study priority and feasibility, and 3) monitoring of intervention trials for accrual and scientific 
progress. The PRMS collaborates with, but operates independently of, the IRB and the UCCC Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The PRMS Chair reports directly to the UCCC Director. All clinical cancer 
research conducted within UCCC is reviewed to ensure the appropriate PRMS review type occurs and is 
captured accurately in the Clinical Trial Management System, OnCore®. New protocol submissions to PRMS 
are reviewed at appropriate levels based on the type of review and committee standard operating procedures. 
The PRMS is comprised of two committees, the PRMS-Scientific Review Committee (PRMS-SRC) and the 
PRMS-Executive Committee (PRMS-EC). Members of these committees reflect the breadth and diversity of 
disciplines and programs across the UCCC. The PRMS-SRC meets twice per month to evaluate the scientific 
merit of studies and provide a focused, well-documented, and timely scientific review of institutional and industry 
intervention protocols. PRMS-SRC membership includes the PRMS Chair, Deputy Chair, biostatisticians and a 
diverse group of 30 investigators from oncologic disciplines. In the prior three years, PRMS has reviewed and 
prioritized 528 intervention studies. 30% (156) were National Clinical Trial Network (NCTN) or external peer 
reviewed studies that received a feasibility and prioritization review only. The remaining 70% were institutional 
(89) and industry (283) studies. Of the interventional studies reviewed at full board, 19 of 376 (5%) were 
disapproved, 35 of 376 (9%) required modifications be made to the protocol prior to approval, and 75 of 376 
protocols (20%) required clarifications prior to approval. PRMS reviews all amendments submitted for active 
protocols. The PRMS-EC meets quarterly and assesses the scientific progress of protocols. This group also 
creates the by-laws for how PRMS functions and approves all operational changes made to PRMS. PRMS-EC 
membership includes the PRMS Chair, Deputy Chair, and six senior investigators. Since July 2016, 36 studies 
were closed by PRMS for a lack of progress or closed voluntarily by the principal investigator (PI) following 
receipt of low-accrual letters from PRMS. During the next grant period, PRMS will continue to apply a careful 
evaluation of feasibility and prioritization to ensure UCCC investigators open studies that are scientifically 
meritorious, feasible, and meet the priorities of the UCCC. PRMS will support a continued emphasis on 
successful investigator-initiated trials across UCCC. PRMS is working with the Office of Community Outreach 
and Engagement (COE) to encourage and promote study inclusion of underserved populations and 
underrepresented minorities (URM) and will monitor URM accruals to studies."

Shared Resource (SR) Management is under the direction of the Associate Director for Basic Research, Ford 
(THI), and is structured to ensure that the University of Colorado Cancer Center (UCCC) invests in cutting edge 
technologies and research services that advance the research efforts of UCCC members. In the last cycle, 
the CCSG supported 10 SRs. Twelve SRs are presented in this renewal representing new SRs, added services 
and technologies, and restructured SRs that are aligned with UCCC members' current research and are focused 
on developing and innovating services and processes, and adopting new technologies to help drive members' 
research forward. The roster of SRs includes Animal Imaging, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Cell 
Technologies, Drug Discovery and Development, Flow Cytometry, Functional Genomics, Genomics, Human 
Immune Monitoring, Mass Spectrometry, Pathology, Population Health, and Structural Biology. In addition, a 
Pre-clinical Human Immune System Mouse Models SR is under development to support UCCC member 
research in tumor immunology and novel immunology-based therapies. To ensure that UCCC SRs serve 
members optimally, input and evaluation is solicited from users, internal and external advisory groups, and 
institutional stakeholders to inform decisions made by the UCCC Executive Committee (EC) on investments in, 
and changes to, UCCC SRs including the allocation of CCSG and institutional support, capital investments, 
development of new SRs, and sunsetting outdated or underperforming SRs. Over the past funding period, capital 
and operational investments totaling $26.9M have enabled the acquisition of cutting edge technologies such as 
multiplexed immunostaining (Vectra/MIBI), a NovaSeq 6000, a 10x Genomics Chromium to support single cell 
sequencing efforts, and a 9.4 Tesla MRI for high resolution imaging; upgrades of NMR systems, IncuCytes, IVIS 
and CT scanners; multiple mass spectrometers; addition of equipment to drive efficiencies (e.g. Sony MA900 
self-run cell sorter; development of applications to support basic analyses of RNAseq data); replacement of aging 
equipment; and addition of services to drive member research forward (e.g. CryoEM for structural studies, 
organoid models for tumor biology studies, and high-throughput screening for drug discovery), while keeping all 
within reach of most funded investigators. Ninety-four percent (94% / n=247) of UCCC members have used the 
SRs over the funding period demonstrating the value of the SRs to members' research. Sixty percent (60%) of 
the UCCC users were peer-reviewed at the time of use. UCCC SRs contributed to 548 cancer-focused 
publications in the past cycle, many of which are high-profile as demonstrated by the fact that 21% have an 
impact factor (IF) ≥ 10 and that publications appear in journals such as Cell, Cancer Cell, and Nature Medicine. 
In short, UCCC SR Management is committed to ensuring each SR is providing essential, cutting edge 
equipment and services to UCCC members in their pursuit of advancing cancer research."

Late Onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is the most common form of age-related dementia.
Currently, 5 million people in the US are afflicted with LOAD and with the aging population this
number is expected to double in the next decades. There are no drugs to cure or halt the
progression of LOAD. The two pathological hallmarks of LOAD are extracellular amyloid plaques
formed by the insoluble A peptide and neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyperphosphorylated
Tau protein. To date, most clinical drug candidates have targeted A, but none have proven
effective at ameliorating the symptoms of AD. New drug targets are needed to combat this
increasingly common and devastating disease. The recent identification of LOAD risk factors has
revealed an enrichment of proteins in the endosomal-lysosomal network (ELN). This
corroborates decades of evidence that the disruption of the ELN is an early event in LOAD
pathogenesis and indicates that the ELN contains potential drug targets. However, a lack of
molecular characterization of ELN has prevented the discovery of suitable candidates. Once
considered “undruggable”, protein-protein interactions (PPI) are emerging as attractive targets for
drug development. Global analysis of PPI in the ELN has not been studied. We propose to use
mass spectrometry to quantitate different biochemical characteristics ELN protein complexes and
determine how LOAD induces alterations in PPI within the ELN. These experiments will be
performed in human brain tissues (AD vs. age-matched controls) and in human AD and control
IPSC derived neurons and organoids. Endogenous ELN targets will be immunoprecipitated with
validated antibodies and quantitated between conditions to identify novel ELN interactors and
disease-relevant drug targets. Quantitation will be performed using multiplexing isobaric labeling
technology. The structure of the ELN complexes will also be resolved, and differences will be
quantitated with using our Covalent Protein Painting method. Additionally, we will employ a novel
application of the non-canonical amino acid, azidohomoalanine, to quantitate the stability of ELN
protein complexes. Our proposal will produce three different quantitative measurements of the
influence of LOAD pathogenesis on ELN protein complexes and will provide alternative drug
development targets for the most common form of age-related dementia."
10837792,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
As of 2018, 30.3 million Americans have been diagnosed with diabetes (10% of the U.S. population with a
male sex bias). Its close associations with many chronic diseases, such as heart attacks, strokes, and cancers,
make diabetes a leading risk factor for morbidity and mortality. In all forms of diabetes, the inability to maintain
normal glucose levels results from progressive dysfunction and eventual loss of insulin-producing b-cells in the
pancreas. With high rates of treatment failure on standard therapy, developing new therapeutic approaches to
preserve or even enhance b-cell function is a priority. Furthermore, differences in metabolism between men
and women during healthy aging and disease are appreciated but poorly understood.
Pancreatic b-cells require several key factors to appropriately secrete insulin. One such factor is MafA, a
transcription factor fundamental to mature b-cell function. The early loss of human MafA (MAFA) in b-cells in
patients with type 2 diabetes highlights its importance to human b-cell health. In addition, a naturally occurring,
genetic mutation in MAFA (S64F MAFA) was recently identified to predispose carriers to either familial, adult-
onset diabetes or hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). Curiously, S64F MAFA-associated diabetes is much
more prevalent in men while women tend to present with hypoglycemia. To better understand the sex-
dependent effects of this variant, we generated a mouse model harboring this mutation. This model shows the
expected sex-dependent effects seen in humans, suggesting similar mechanisms between mice and humans.
Male S64F MAFA mice were hyperglycemic due to widespread, premature b-cell aging and senescence, while
female S64F MAFA mice were hypoglycemic by a mechanism which is not yet clearly defined. However, our
preliminary studies suggest that S64F MAFA creates different b-cell subtypes in females, one of which is
hyperfunctional. Taken together, these results suggest that S64F MAFA can incur diverse b-cell responses to
produce sex-dependent diseases: diabetes (b-cell hypofunction) and hypoglycemia (b-cell hyperfunction).
This investigation will identify and compare the diverse molecular responses to S64F MAFA in male and
female b-cells across mice and humans to understand the sex-dependent, b-cell responses unique to human
b-cells. We will first use the penetrant, proof-of-principle S64F MAFA mouse model which mimics several
aspects of human disease to identify the diverse b-cell populations by single cell transcriptomics. For example,
diversity in premature aging signatures will be related to the dysfunction seen in senescent, male S64F MAFA
b-cells. We will then investigate the molecular and functional responses to the S64F MAFA protein in
genetically modified, male and female human b-cells using novel pseudoislet technology to identify targets
unique to human b-cell function. In sum, our work will advance fundamental understanding of sex-dependent
b-cell responses in humans. Mechanisms underlying a relative male vulnerability and female resistance to
diabetes in this model can be harnessed to develop therapies tailored to the individual."
10837899,"Project Summary/Abstract: We will expand an existing, patient-centered, health literacy strategy to promote
longer-term adherence to colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in resource-limited, rural health clinics via
colonoscopy or annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Guided by recently completed trials, we will leverage
consumer technologies that are now available in rural areas and implement a multifaceted approach -
designed for scale in resource-limited federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). While significant gains have
been made to improve CRC screening, compliance with those guidelines is sub-optimal and disparities remain.
In particular, adults who receive care at rural FQHCs that have limited resources struggle to initiate and
maintain annual CRC screening via the most common method, FIT. Over the past decade, our team has
studied the effectiveness of specific interventions to enhance initial and repeat CRC screening completion
among lower income, lower health literate, racial/ethnically diverse adults in rural FQHC settings. The majority
of patients will complete the initial test (67% - 69%), yet fewer (32% - 40%) complete an annual test in years 2
and 3. This indicates a ‘stepped care’ approach is needed to promote long-term CRC screening. Our rural
health literacy interventions have until now been limited to the FIT due to restrictions of state Medicaid
coverage and clinical bandwidth of colonoscopy services available to rural FQHCs. Changes to Medicaid have
now expanded the availability of colonoscopy. We now propose a novel intervention guided by evidence
learned from our previous studies and recent literature - the Patient-centered Reminders to Inform, Motivate,
and Engage-CRC Screening (PRIME-CRC).In our proposed 2-arm, randomized control trial (N=1200), both
PRIME-CRC and enhanced usual care arms will receive our health literacy evidence-based practices for
delivering CRC patient information and counseling to aid patient decision making for selecting FIT or
colonoscopy and simplified test instructions. PRIME-CRC will additionally have a stepped care’ approach for
reminding patients on proper CRC screening preparation for scheduled colonoscopy or completion of annual
FIT. Patients in the PRIME-CRC arm will have frequent follow-up with tailored contact via automated call or
SMS text (based on patient preference) from their healthcare provider (audio recorded or personalized text)
.The primary outcome will be completion of either colonoscopy or annual FIT over 3 years. Our specific aims
are to: Test the effectiveness of the PRIME-CRC intervention to improve CRC screening completion rates in
rural FQHCs compared to enhanced usual care. Investigate whether the intervention can reduce CRC
screening disparities by patient health literacy, race or sex. Determine the fidelity, or reliability of PRIME-CRC
components, and explore patient, provider, and healthcare system barriers to implementation. Evaluate the
cost associated with the intervention from a FQHC perspective. This study extends our team’s longstanding
collaboration on health literacy, health disparities, rural health and cancer screening."
10837900,"Renewed funding is requested to continue a T32 training program to train the next generation of prevention
scientists with expertise in HIV and related co-morbidities among substance users. Our program builds upon
two joint doctoral programs in Public Health and Interdisciplinary Research on Substance Use offered in
partnership between the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and the San Diego
State University (SDSU) Graduate Schools of Public Health and Social Work, and a doctoral program in
Biostatistics offered in the newly founded UCSD Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health. Our objectives are:
1) To provide interdisciplinary training experiences for pre-doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows in
epidemiology, health behavior, and biostatistics, and public health who wish to focus on prevention research at
the intersection between substance abuse and HIV or other syndemics (e.g. viral hepatitis, TB, STIs, SARS-
CoV-2, overdose, stigma, trauma); 2) To support advanced training in key NIH research areas, including a new
focus on data sciences applied to substance use and HIV or related syndemics in both domestic and
international settings; 3) To recruit and equip researchers from diverse academic backgrounds and under-
represented minority (URM) populations with the tools needed to become independent behavioral scientists
with state-of-the-art skills in substance use and HIV prevention research; 4) To train individuals in the
responsible conduct of research (RCR) with human subjects, especially in international and cross-cultural
settings. In sum, during the past 4 years, our program supported 26 trainees (11 predoctoral and 15
postdoctoral fellows; 12 (46%) were URM). Of completed trainees 2017-2021, (8 predocs and 8 postdocs), all
but 1 are still active in the field. Time to matriculation for predocs averaged 3 years. Five K-series awards were
newly awarded to postdocs. Our 26 predocs and postdocs published 84 and 116 manuscripts, respectively,
44% of which were first authored. We request continued support for 4 predoctoral and 4 postdoctoral trainees,
who will be mentored from a pool of 30 Preceptors. Depending on their level of training, mentees complete
courses in substance use and infectious diseases, RCR instruction, quarterly cultural sensitivity training
workshops, seminars on scientific rigor, presentations on 'Work In Progress', and seminars (e.g., Writing
Circle). Our active research projects in nearby Mexico and numerous other lower and middle income countries
offer the opportunity for unique, hands-on international training experiences and a robust infrastructure for
trainees to develop into independent investigators focused on prevention of HIV and related syndemics among
substance using populations."
10837903,"Abstract: Collins and Riley, Directors of NIH and of NIH’s Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research,
have described the 21st century data revolution as potentially “transformative” for social and behavioral science
(SBS) research. Evolutionary leaps in technology have generated vast arrays of novel sources of Big Data: in
2018, for example, 500 million microblogs were tweeted daily, and 2.48 billion users engaged with Facebook.
The data revolution has also catalyzed massive growth in administrative data, as governments and other
entities digitize their data (e.g., the CDC has data on billions of prescriptions dispensed in the US). Constella-
tions of tweets, posts, and administrative data provide “transformative” opportunities for SBS researchers to
swiftly identify threats to health; characterize-more comprehensively than ever before, and often in real time-
the conditions in which people thrive, suffer, and die; and develop novel interventions.
 Nowhere are such transformations more direly needed than to address a 21st century crisis: substance
use disorders (SUD). In 2017, HHS declared the opioid crisis a national emergency, as 11.4 million people
misused opioid analgesics, and overdoses killed >70,000 people, contributing to a drop in US life expectancy.
 We are, though, failing to prepare the next generation of SBS researchers to engage these transforma-
tive tools. A scan of syllabi from departments of behavioral and social science in 10 top public health schools
reveals that required methods courses culminate with multilevel and structural equation models, decades-old
methods ill-equipped to leverage emerging data to catalyze transformative approaches to end SUD epidemics.
 Supported by 45 Emory faculty from 11 departments, the proposed training program (TADA) will
prepare a diverse cadre of 21st century SBS researchers to develop transformative approaches to end the SUD
crisis. TADA will prepare trainees to ethically, critically, and seamlessly integrate advanced data science
methods into the SBS research lifecycle for SUD. Trainees will learn to: (1) Conduct theoretically-informed
studies of distributions and ecologies of SUD-related harms using advanced data science methods; (2)
Conduct theoretically-informed studies motivating and assessing policies and programmatic interventions that
may affect SUD-related harms and services; (3) Disseminate findings to multiple stakeholder communities to
strengthen efforts to end SUD-related harms; (4) Critically apply principles of the ethical and responsible
conduct of research. TADA will engage trainees in a comprehensive mentoring program; a 2-semester course
and lab consisting of 5 “modules,” each of which pairs a specific SBS theory with an advanced data science
method; journal clubs; dissertation workshops; $5000 dissertation grants; and research rotations at Emory, the
CDC, and the Georgia DPH. We are seeking 5 funded slots across two cohorts, each with 2 years of funding,
for pre-doctoral students in 4 programs (Behavioral Science, Health Policy, Sociology’s Health Track, and
Clinical Psychology). TADA will extend its reach beyond funded trainees via a TADA Certificate program."
10838894,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Host status plays a major role in tuberculosis (TB) disease outcomes, with many efforts to develop host-directed
therapies to boost immune response. It is unknown how these strategies will perform in people living with
HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) who are at increased risk of adverse TB treatment outcomes. Persistent Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb), which obligates prolonged TB treatment, highly expresses the stringent response protein
RelMtb. One attractive host-directed therapeutic strategy is boosting RelMtb-specific cellular responses. We
developed a novel therapeutic DNA TB vaccine that promotes immune responses to RelMtb, which are further
enhanced by fusion with a chemokine gene, Macrophage Inflammatory Protein-3 alpha (MIP-3α), that targets
relMtb to immature dendritic cells (DCs). Our data show that an intranasal (IN) or intramuscular (IM) DNA vaccine
expressing MIP-3α/relMtb (“fusion” vaccine) demonstrated greater adjunctive therapeutic efficacy when combined
with the first-line TB treatment in Mtb-infected mice as compared to IM vaccination with relMtb alone (“non-fusion”
vaccine). This proposal will dissect the mechanisms of this novel therapeutic strategy, specifically with IN
administration which had the highest efficacy. We will also test whether this strategy is likely to perform in
PLWHA, analyzing whether RelMtb-specific immune responses in PLWHA can predict therapeutic TB outcomes.
Aim 1 will investigate the molecular mechanism by which the IN administration potentiates anti-TB drugs, while
Aim 2 will focus on the role of DCs in the adjunctive therapeutic efficacy of the fusion vaccination strategy. Aim
3 will test the translational potential of the RelMtb-specific T-cell immunity in PLWHA. In Aim 1, we test if IN
vaccine administration enhances the host response to Mtb infection through increased IL-17A secretion. We will
perform single-cell transcriptomics on cells from murine lungs to confirm the upregulation of IL-17A response
pathways in the IN arm, followed by Mtb-infected IL-17A knockout murine experiments. In Aim 2, we hypothesize
that the IN fusion vaccine leads to more efficient systemic and local T-cell maturation, activation, and
differentiation through enhanced DC activation compared to the IN non-fusion vaccine. Aim 2a will assess
differences in DC activation by flow cytometry, DC and T-cell co-localization in murine tissues, and differences
in T-cell activation/differentiation using co-culture experiments with DCs derived from each vaccination group. In
Aim 2b, we will adoptively transfer DCs from mice immunized with either vaccine into Mtb-infected mice
concurrently with TB treatment to compare the adjunctive therapeutic efficacy. In Aim 3, we hypothesize that
RelMtb-specific Th1/Th17 cell responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from HIV-infected and
uninfected patients receiving treatment for pulmonary TB, correlate inversely with sputum culture conversion and
TB recurrence rates, independently of HIV status. The proposed studies will uncover critical details of the
mechanism of a novel therapeutic vaccination approach against TB with important implications in PLWHA and
help the PI to gain significant expertise in TB/HIV immunology."
10838746,"Project summary:
 The goal of this proposal is to reveal mechanisms by which gene regulatory proteins overcome chromosome
structural barriers, to change cell fates. The work will provide foundational insight into gene regulation and more
efficient ways to generate new cell types for therapy and disease modeling. The proposal extends from 38 years
of research on my R01 grant, to dissect the interplay between pioneer transcription factors and initially targeted
chromatin, combined with new directions from my recently expired P01 grant, where we revealed the functional
complexity of mammalian heterochromatin states. Work on both grants revealed that after the initial closed
chromatin binding by pioneer factors, a rate-limiting step of cell reprogramming is the inefficiency of activating
genes in H3K9me3 heterochromatin. We defined pioneer transcription factors by their ability to target a DNA
motif, or a partial motif, on a nucleosome, and thereby initiate cooperative events in DNase/ATAC-resistant,
transcriptionally silent chromatin bound by linker histone. Yet despite the ability to target linker histone-
compacted chromatin in vitro and in vivo, we and others found that some, but not all, pioneer factors are impeded
from binding H3K9me3 heterochromatin, leading us to investigate how certain pioneer factors can target such
heterochromatin. In the past grant period, our biochemical, structural, single molecule tracking, genomic, and
long-read sequencing approaches revealed that pioneer factors interact with core histones to facilitate
nucleosome binding and chromatin opening, that pioneer factors use unstructured domains for opening and
linker histone displacement, and that a pioneer factor licenses a nucleosome remodeler to further open local
chromatin. Having genetically identified amino acids on pioneer factors for binding nucleosomes, not free DNA,
in vitro allows us to assess, in vivo, truly pioneering events by the factors. We discovered diverse proteins
functionally bound to heterochromatin that repress genes and DNA repeats and are associated with varying
H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 marks, thereby defining heterochromatin subtypes. We propose to categorize pioneer
factors by the subtypes of heterochromatin that they target. We will use transcription factor binding to in vitro
heterochromatin reconstituted on nucleosome arrays, pulldowns between transcription factors and biochemically
fractionated heterochromatin, and genetic approaches in mice and cell cultures to define protein domains on
pioneer factors that enable heterochromatin subtype targeting and local chromatin opening, and that can be
transferred to other proteins to enhance reprogramming. We will use our dual-degron technology and knock-
downs to reveal how mammalian H3K9me3 heterochromatic domains are established and can be disassembled
selectively, to enhance reprogramming. We will determine the basis for, and utility of, our discovery of a transient
global disruption of heterochromatin elicited by reprogramming pioneer factors. The work will be performed in a
research environment that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our approaches will reveal basic genetic
mechanisms and will be applied to improving directed cell fate changes for biomedical purposes."
10838750,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of the proposed study is to develop and pilot an interactive, gamified, online, training program
in Motivational Interviewing (MI) specifically for HIV counseling support staff (CSS), which includes HIV
counselors and community health workers, to improve health communication in status-neutral HIV care
interactions. MI is an empathic, collaborative, counselling and communication approach that has demonstrated
efficacy in improving outcomes across the HIV Care Continuum (HCC) in adults and adolescents. It is embedded
in HIV care guidelines and training in MI is often provided to CSS by state and regional agencies. However,
achieving competency in MI is not easy and the training typically provided to CSS is insufficient to achieve
competence in MI. To ensure that MI retains its demonstrated efficacy in improving HCC outcomes, we must
develop scalable MI training approaches that can both reach CSS working in HIV care settings and effectively
increase their MI skills. To address this dual need, this study seeks to develop iMI4HIV, an interactive, gamified,
online, MI training program specifically tailored for CSS in HIV care settings to improve their MI skills in HIV care
communications. The goal is to train CSS to deliver MI competently so they can integrate MI into all of their
healthcare communications with individuals receiving or seeking HIV related services (status-neutral). CSS will
be able to access iMI4HIVs after completing a live virtual MI introductory workshop, providing additional skills
training that specifically targets MI skills shown by research to affect behavior change outcomes. Thus, iMI4HIV
will fill that critical need for additional post-workshop training that is rarely available to community providers. The
Specific Aims of this study are to: 1) Develop iMI4HIV, an interactive, online, gamified MI training program
specifically tailored towards CSS in HIV care settings to improve their MI skills with HIV care clients; 2) Conduct
a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Virtual MI training workshop + iMI4HIV vs. Virtual MI training workshop
+ waitlist control (N=30 CSS) to: a) assess the feasibility and acceptability of iMI4HIV as measured by the percent
of participants who complete iMI4HIV and retrospective acceptability ratings of iMI4HIV (Primary Aim), and b)
explore preliminary findings on the effects of iMI4HIV on MI skills acquisition (Exploratory Aim); and 3) Explore
experiences (including obstacles and facilitators) of completing iMI4HIV via in-depth interviews. As designed,
this study specifically responds to the Notice of Special Interest: Advancing Health Communication Research on
HIV Prevention, Treatment and Cure (NOT-MH-21-105) announced by NIH, which includes an interest in studies
that seek to “optimize effective communication and engagement practices between PLHIV and healthcare
providers.” If successful in building CSS MI skills, iMI4HIV has the potential to shift how MI training is provided

10839046,"The importance of – and difficulty in – sustaining implementation, with fidelity, of effective HIV interventions
is well recognized. Our research partnership of >20 years in The Bahamas, a country disproportionately
impacted by the HIV epidemic, positions us well to explore sustainability of evidence-based interventions
(EBIs) (Is the effective intervention still being delivered in schools after research-support implementation is
ended? To what degree do the sustaining schools implement EBI with fidelity?) and evaluate multilevel
determinants of sustainability for school-based HIV prevention program. Sustainability of EBIs has been
identified as a major research priority for many years. Research on the sustainability of EBIs has been growing
rapidly, but the sustainability of school-based health interventions after external funds end has been relatively
unexplored. Our research will advance the field of implementation science and HIV prevention through
qualitative and quantitative investigation of the processes of sustained implementation and adaptation. This
effort builds on experience gained from completed research (R01HD064350) exploring factors related to
fidelity of implementation of an evidence-based intervention—Focus on Youth in the Caribbean (FOYC) plus
Caribbean Informed Parents and Children Together (CImPACT) (“standard implementation”). The research
also capitalizes on the opportunity afforded by a national implementation study (R01HD095765, 2018-2023)
to evaluate theory-driven implementation strategies to increase fidelity of teacher implementation of
FOYC+CImPACT in school settings (“enhanced implementation”). Our long-term goal is to develop a
generalizable model for sustaining evidence-based prevention programs in school settings. This study aims to
investigate the trajectories and determinants of program sustainability following the four-year implementation
phase. We define sustainability as the extent to which programs maintain core elements/activities,
implementation strategies, and program outcomes over time. As part of the national implementation trial in
2019-2023, 79 teachers in New Providence taught FOYC+CImPACT to four cohorts of grade-6 students (each
cohort >2,000 students) in 24 public elementary schools. Teachers taught > 80% of the intervention
curriculum in 2019–2023. To address the wider global questions as to what occurs (and why) after research-
support delivery of an effective program in a community setting ends, we propose to conduct a two-year follow-
up study among the 79 teachers, 24 school coordinators, and 12 high-performing teachers (mentors) involved
in the national implementation study. The proposed time-critical study will leverage the NIH-funded decade-
long implementation research to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Evaluate the sustainment of an effective
HIV prevention program over two years; 2) Identify the multilevel determinants of sustainability of the school-
based HIV prevention program; 3) Examine the impact of adaptation and implementation strategies on
sustainability and student outcomes."
10765734,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) accounts for approximately 5-10% of diabetes (> 20 million patients worldwide), and T1D patients are predicted to triple by 2050. It is therefore imperative to understand the mechanisms that contribute to T1D evolution, so that improved treatments can be developed to prevent and delay the onset and progression of the disease. In this regard, T1D is a consequence of autoimmune destruction of β-cells, and ER stress and cytokines play critical roles in this process. Importantly, we reported that the Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2β (iPLA2β), which in the islet is predominantly localized in β-cells, is a key participant in β-cell apoptosis in response to stimuli that induce ER stress (e.g., pro-inflammatory cytokines (CTKs) and hyperglycemia). The iPLA2β catalyzes hydrolysis of the sn-2 fatty acyl substituent from membrane phospholipids to liberate arachidonic acid, which can be metabolized to eicosanoids (i.e., iPLA2β-derived lipids (iDLs)). We find that select iDLs are associated with the onset of diabetes in rodent models of T1D, and that inhibition or genetic ablation of iPLA2β promotes decreases in these iDLs, leading to preservation of β-cell mass and T1D amelioration.  Mechanistically, ER stress and apoptosis are suppressed by factors such as MCL-1 and Bcl-x(L), Bcl-2 family members that promote β-cell survival. Many apoptotic factors such as these undergo alternative RNA splicing (AS) to generate splice variants with contrasting roles (e.g., the MCL-1S and Bcl-x(s) isoforms). For example, we demonstrated that anti-apoptotic Bcl-x(L) protein is lost from β-cells undergoing apoptosis due to a shift in Bcl-x 5’ splice site (5’SS) selection and generating Bcl-x(s) RNA. We also find that AS of caspase-9 and RAGE towards pro-apoptotic variants correlates with iPLA2β expression and differences in the β-cell lipidome. Our preliminary studies reveal (a) candidate human islet β-cell-derived iDLs that regulate AS, (b) [ratio of Bcl-x(L)/x(s) inversely correlating with iPLA2β expression in NOD islet β-cells and T1D incidence and] (c) through expanded splicomic studies via biostatistical analyses of deep RNA sequencing, additional AS events [(RUVBL1)] regulated by these iDLs. These findings motivate us to assess the role of iDL-mediated AS in β-cells in T1D development. Specifically, we propose to explore the hypothesis that iDLs contribute to apoptotic events in β-cells and that these lipid fingerprints act as early predictors of T1D onset/progression. Mechanistically, we hypothesize that iDLs modulate AS dis-favoring the generation of anti-apoptotic isoforms in β-cells. To interrogate our hypotheses, [we will utilize islets from β-cell and macrophage conditional NOD.iPLA2β-KO mice, human iPSC-derived β-cells, and human islets to]: SA1: Determine the ?-cell lipidome and iDLs that link ER stress, β-cell death and T1D development; SA2: Determine whether β-cell survival can be enhanced by modulation of specific AS induced by iDLs; SA3: Delineate the molecular mechanisms through which iDLs modulate AS. Overall, we posit that a more complete understanding of these iDLs and their mechanisms of action will lead to novel strategies to preserve β-cell viability and prevent the onset/progression of T1D."
10848895,"The goal of this research education program ─ Inspiring Undergraduate Student Training in Alzheimer's
Research (USTAR) ─ is to provide Black/African American (B/AA) undergraduate students with mentored
didactic, clinical, and research experiences to stimulate interest in pursuing research careers related to
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). USTAR specifically focuses on social determinants of
health as risk factors for ADRD in B/AAs. USTAR's scientific rationale is that B/AA undergraduates are less
likely that White undergraduates to enter the biomedical workforce. This disparity is important because B/AAs
are disproportionally affected by ADRD, and B/AA scientists may more deeply appreciate the sociocultural
forces that create racial health disparities. USTAR brings together the research training skills of faculty at
Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) and Delaware State University (DSU), a Historically Black College and
University (HBCU). USTAR's multi-PI leaders include an ADRD clinical researcher (Rovner; TJU), a B/AA
ADRD neuroscientist (Lawal; DSU), and a geriatrician who focuses on ADRD (Parks; TJU). Our combined
expertise in ADRD research and clinical care, social determinants of health, neuroscience, neuroimaging, and
interprofessional care in geriatrics, and our experience recruiting and mentoring B/AA undergraduates, guide
this exciting new learning opportunity. The 20-month USTAR program will train two cohorts of ten rising junior
B/AA undergraduates. Each USTAR trainee will have an Academic Mentor who advises on academic progress
and career planning, and a Research Mentor who advises on research training. Trainees may seek optional
mentorship from a B/AA faculty mentor if a trainee wishes to have a race-congruent mentoring experience. The
USTAR program is comprised of: 1) two 8-week summer sessions (i.e., one session prior to both the junior and
senior undergraduate years) that include didactic, research, clinical, and community-based learning
experiences; 2) educational and research activities during the junior and senior academic years; and 3) a
model longitudinal observational study of a racially diverse sample of older adults with normal cognition, mild
cognitive impairment, and ADRD. Across all activities, we will emphasize the relationship between social
determinants of health and cognition. Collaborating faculty include 17 clinicians and researchers with
complementary expertise. The Specific Aims of USTAR are to: 1) Provide interdisciplinary ADRD-related
research, educational, clinical, and community experiences; 2) Enhance trainee research skills via independent
research projects; 3) Facilitate B/AA student transition from undergraduate to graduate studies in science; and
4) Evaluate USTAR's effectiveness. USTAR has potential to increase diversity in the national workforce that
conducts health disparities research pertaining to ADRD. This goal aligns with the NIA mission to meet the
nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs and to ensure health equity for all Americans."
10848919,"The University of Virginia School of Data Science and Center for Public Health Genomics will
collaborate to establish REGARDS (Research Experiences in Genomics Applications of
Responsible Data Science). Over the next five years, REGARDS will train 45 Masters-level
genomics data scientists through both classroom and research experiences. UVA’s Masters in
Data Science program is ideally suited to this effort because it affords 1) a year-long capstone
experience, 2) space for elective courses which allow students to acquire vital genomics content
knowledge alongside their data science curriculum, and 3) an emphasis on responsible data
science and research ethics that is crucial to the training of the biomedical and informatics
workforce. The School of Data Science has robust supports for student recruitment and mature
relationships with minority-serving institutions (MSIs) to ensure that the students trained in
genomics data science represent the diversity of the patients that will be impacted by their work.
As part of this initiative, the program leaders will revise data science courses (including our
required course on data ethics) to include more genomics and biosciences examples. We will
create three new courses: “Genomics Foundations”, “Foundations of Computational Genomics”
and “Statistical Genetics - Methods and Applications”. REGARDS participants each will complete
a two-semester research capstone as part of their degree. UVA School of Medicine researchers
have contributed projects to engage three student teams each year for five years, representing
the breadth of genomics data science: wet labs, microbiome projects, precision medicine and
bioinformatics. As part of this initiative, we will leverage well-attended data science events (virtual
and in person) to spread awareness about career opportunities and interesting problems in
genomic data science. Through these events and annual competitions, we will broaden public
interest in genomic data science, further expanding the potential workforce in genomic data
science."
10848832,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Molecular mediators of muscle spindle
mechanosensation.
Many conditions, including aging, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, and neuromuscular diseases,
negatively impact the function of muscle proprioceptors. The Group Ia and II muscle spindle afferents are
slowly-adapting mechanoreceptors and provide the primary sensory information for proprioception and
comprise the sensory arm of the muscle stretch reflex. The exact molecular mechanism used to translate
muscle stretch into action potentials in these neurons is only incompletely understood. However, the
mechanically gated ion channel PIEZO2 is known to be necessary for normal stretch sensitivity and multiple
genetic diseases that increase or decrease PIEZO2 channel function are known to impair proprioception and
motor behaviors. The voltage gated sodium channel NaV1.1 and vesicle-released glutamate are also known to
be necessary for maintained excitability during static stretch. The overarching goal of this proposal is to
understand how the developmental timing of dysfunction in those proteins alters muscle spindle afferent
mechanosensation. We will determine how a mouse model with a gain of function mutation to Piezo2 which
leads to Distal Arthrogryposis Type 5 alters mechanosensation in the muscle spindle afferents when it is
expressed throughout development or only after the muscle spindle is developed (Aim 1). Similarly, we will
determine whether loss of Piezo2 once the muscle spindle develops eliminates stretch sensitive firing as it
does following constitutive loss. We will also use a model of Angelman Syndrome that decreases Piezo2
channel activity to determine how mechanosensation is impaired under a less complete decrease in Piezo2
function (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine whether loss of NaV1.1 after the muscle spindle has developed
leads to similar inconsistent static phase firing as observed following constitutive loss and whether NaV1.1
and/or vesicle-released glutamate are less important for mediating the more rapidly-adapting stretch responses
seen before the muscle spindle matures (Aim 3). These results will increase understanding of how alteration in
the function of key components of the muscle spindle afferent mechanotransduction machinery affect function
during genetic disorders or other later-onset disease states that target these molecular mediators."
10862383,"SUMMARY – OVERALL
A major goal of NIMH is to understand the neurobiology underlying common cognitive and behavioral deficits
associated with mental disorders. Such behavioral deficits, as well as action plans executed in response to
novel sensory experiences, are gated by cognitive processing within neocortical circuits. It is expected that
a mechanistic and multi-level biological understanding of how cortical circuits are built and refined during
development will reveal molecular targets for future therapeutic strategies to treat mental disorders. Thus,
the goal of this Center is to understand how gene expression and associated gene function within key
neuronal subtypes regulates neurobiological substrates required to form cortical circuits that enable
decision-making and behavioral adaptations. A Conte Center will provide rapid and efficient bidirectional
flow of information and tools, as well as synergy and integration that could not be achieved using individual
grants. Ras and Rho-like small GTPases play fundamental biological roles within neurons by controlling cell-
autonomous growth-related signaling pathways and orchestrating neuronal circuit assembly and function.
GEFs and GAPs are direct upstream regulators of small GTPase signaling, and within neurons, orchestrate
cellular migration, neuronal morphogenesis, synaptic connectivity, synaptic plasticity triggered in response
to novel sensory experience, in vivo neural circuit function, and associated behavioral adaptations. GEFs
and GAPs as exemplar biological entry points for understanding how cellular GTPase signaling shapes
neural circuits that facilitate adaptive behaviors. However, it is unknown how their expression and function
within specific neuronal subtypes and defined developmental windows drive cortical circuit refinement to
impact cognitive processing and associated behaviors. To close this knowledge gap, our team is proposing
an integrated, interdisciplinary, multi-level “Center for GTPase Regulation of Neuronal Cell Biology and
Behavior” to study the roles of GTPase signaling in cortical neural circuit with the goal of understanding
fundamental principles that drive the hierarchical organization of brain circuits that underlie complex
behaviors. Comprised of investigators with expertise that spans all major levels of brain function – molecular,
synaptic, cellular, circuit, system, and behavior – the Impact of our Center will be to mechanistically connect
the regulation of GTPase signaling within distinct neuronal subtypes to the assembly and function of
behavioral circuits associated with mental disorders."
10862384,"SUMMARY – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Administrative Core (Admin Core) will function as the organizational and scientific hub of the Center to
ensure success of the research projects and cores that make up the foundation of the Center. This will be
accomplished by promoting effective governance, efficient management, good communication, and a strong
culture of collaboration among all investigators that encourages creativity, knowledge sharing, and scientific
rigor. The Admin Core will be responsible for the overall organization of the Center including the scheduling
of teleconferences and meetings, engagement of the External Scientific Advisors and interactions with NIH
program staff. In addition, the Admin Core will coordinate the community engagement activities. Finally, the
Admin Core will lead efforts to communicate Center activities and findings to the public and scientific
community through maintenance of a website, strategic use of social media, scientific publications,
presentations at national and international conferences, resource sharing and data dissemination. The
Administrative Core will pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1) Manage and coordinate all administrative
and collaborative activities of the Center. This Aim will involve organization and leadership of the Center,
formation of an Executive Committee, interaction with the Internal and External Advisory Boards, writing a
Center Charter, promoting scientific rigor and reproducibility, conflict resolution as well as student and
postdoctoral training. Aim 2) Facilitate communication across participating institutions and community
partners. This Aim will involve organization of project and core team meetings, of a seminar series and an
annual meeting, community engagement, and reporting to NIH. Aim 3) Enable public awareness of Center
activities and ensure timely resource sharing. This Aim will involve creating a Center website, social media
outlets, as well as resource sharing and dissemination of results."
10850086,"The development of single-cell genomics technologies has been a driving force in biomedical research over the
past decade because of the throughput, sensitivity, and precision with which such techniques can dissect
complex biological systems. A primary example of the impact of these tools is the rapid translation of single-cell
RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) for comprehensively cataloging cellular states for the Human Cell Atlas project.
Technology that combine microfluidic platforms with DNA barcoding strategies have drastically increased the
throughput and accessibility of scRNAseq so that to-date, the Human Cell Atlas consortium has logged over 67
million cells, enabling unprecedented insight into the cellular diversity in healthy and diseased organs and
tissues. However, while the transcriptome provides a comprehensive and quantitative proxy for cellular state,
proteomic measurements provide a more direct understanding of cellular function, and epigenetic measurements
that profile methylation, histone modifications, and protein-DNA interactions, provide a more complete picture of
the regulatory mechanisms that maintain cell state or drive cellular transitions. Furthermore, cell morphology and
the spatial distribution of proteins and chemicals within the cell can reveal important cellular phenotypes that can
only be characterized by microscopy. Finally, the relative positions of cells within tissues and organs are
necessary for a more complete understanding of the cellular interactions that lead to functional tissues and
organs. This research program focuses on the development of technology to facilitate multimodal precision
measurements in single cells and tissues. We use molecular biology tools and DNA sequencing platforms to
measure the proteome, transcriptome, and epigenome of single cells and nonlinear optical imaging to
characterize chemical composition and morphology of cells. We leverage microfluidic technology to integrate
molecular and optical measurements to enable multimodal single-cell measurement. Additionally, this research
program aims to develop novel computational approaches for integrated analysis of multimodal single-cell
measurements. Our ultimate goal is to develop a tool to make all of these measurements in situ, in order to retain
single-cell spatial information and cellular context in a developing tissue or whole organism."
10850269,"1 Abstract
Sepsis is the leading cause of hospital mortality in the US and imposes immense health and economic burdens.
Optimizing clinical outcomes of sepsis hinges upon early detection, accurate classification of patient phenotype,
and prompt treatment. However, the understanding of sepsis at a pathophysiologic level is limited, making it
challenging for clinicians to effectively diagnose and treat sepsis patients. With technological advancement, mas-
sive electronic health records (EHRs) and registries have been generated by the routine collection of data from
medical and daily activities. These data provide exceptional opportunities for generating insights into improved
clinical decision-making, prognosis, and personalized medicine treatment strategy for sepsis among many other
diseases. On the other hand, EHR data are often high-dimensional, sparse, longitudinal, and include abundant
temporal information. Such complex structures pose great barriers to the use of traditional statistical and machine
learning methods. Although EHR data are often stored in relational databases, they can be represented by an
order-3 tensor, i.e., an array with three directions representing different subjects, features, and time points that
often vary greatly across subjects/features. This tensor-based representation presents a fresh perspective for
analyzing EHR data, offering a new opportunity to improve sepsis care.
 In this proposal, we aim to improve the progress assessment, patient phenotyping, and treatment planning
of sepsis through an integrated tensor-based modeling framework to tackle the challenges associated with high-
dimensional EHR data and their complex temporal structure. The specific tasks include: a) developing an iterative
timeline registration algorithm to enhance the assessment of the progress of sepsis by leveraging the tensor
structure of EHR data; b) devising a tensor-based method for phenotyping using longitudinal high-dimensional
EHR data; c) creating a novel method to estimate the potential outcomes and treatment effects of time-varying
treatment regimes through low-rank tensor completion. The developed tools will become Sepsis Pulse, a module
to be incorporated into an existing digital workflow known as Sepsis Watch within Duke Hospital’s healthcare
system."
10852877,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a devastating epithelial malignancy arising from the mucosa of sites
that include the oral tongue, the floor of mouth, and the buccal mucosa. Advanced disease still has a dismal 5-year survival rate of only ~50%, despite advances in surgical and radiation approaches. Immunotherapy, such
as PD-1 checkpoint blockade, has shown very promising results in a number of malignancies, but in general,
responses are seen only in a minority of the cases. Numerous strategies to enhance endogenous and synthetic
immune-mediated rejection of tumors are under intense investigation; however, all face significant challenges
pending better understanding of the interface between tumor cells and the immune system within the tumor
microenvironment (TME). Areas needing clarity include (1) factors determining tumor sensitivity to immune
pressure; (2) factors determining the expression of neoantigens; and (3) factors determining immune cell
plasticity and “states” induced within the TME. Our research program has been investigating aspects of the
tumor-immune interface. We use primary tumor samples and novel mouse models to understand how to
modulate the immune response to treat human OSCC. We are specifically interested in understanding how
tumor heterogeneity influences the immune response; how we can induce neoantigens on OSCC for immune
targeting; and how we can enhance NK cell function to treat OSCC."
10853010,"Project Abstract
eMERGE IV (E4) proposes to investigate the implementation of 15 “genomic risk assessment” (GRA) scores in
a network-wide set of diverse participants. These GRAs will include polygenic risk score (PRS) information, as
well as risk information, such as personal and family health history, environmental and social health
determinants, and physical and lab measures. The GRA will aggregate these factors into a single score to
identify those who would benefit from screening and other interventions.
Substantial challenges must be addressed before genomic medicine is a part of standard medical care. We will
collaborate to refine multi-ancestry GRAs and support the inclusion of non-genetic risk factors extracted from
the electronic health record with innovative natural language processing approaches and apply them in a
cohort enriched for Asian ancestry, and sexual and gender minorities. The specific aims of our proposal are
designed to use an implementation science approach to advance the integration of genomic data into clinical
practice, including evaluation of patient perspectives and economic outcomes, and broadening the impact of
eMERGE through collaborations. The University of Washington Medicine dedication to preventative health in a
learning health system and broad expertise across genomics, statistical, ethical, informatic, implementation,
outcomes and economic disciplines will support this multi-site clinical trial.
Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Refine GRA scores and outcomes measures for five high impact conditions, considering stakeholder
input, for implementation in the electronic health record. The conditions are: colorectal cancer, breast cancer,
osteoporosis, coronary artery disease, and glaucoma.
Aim 2: Integrate 15 GRA scores and electronic clinical decision support for management into clinical care and
the EHR and capture clinical outcomes.
Aim 3: Evaluate the implementation, effectiveness, and economic utility of GRA result return."

We apply for renewal of the Fogarty HIV-associated Tuberculosis Training Program (HATTP) at the University
of Cape Town (UCT) in partnership with Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and Vanderbilt University Medical
Center (VUMC) building on the successes of the existing training program and productive research
collaborations between these institutions to provide HIV-associated TB (HIV-TB) and HIV-associated COVID-19
training at UCT. The Program addresses the following needs: more clinician scientists/researchers need to be
trained to develop the next generation of scientific leaders in HIV-TB and HIV-COVID-19 at UCT; there is an
urgent need to accelerate transformation of the demographic composition of researchers at UCT to redress
disparities that persist from apartheid; and there are specific training requirements in high-end analytical methods
needed to lift UCT’s capacity to the next level. Six focus areas for training have been chosen: 1) Clinical
Epidemiology and Biostatistics training for clinicians entering research; 2) Advanced Epidemiology and Modelling
of the HIV-TB Epidemic and Interventions; 3) Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacogenetics and Genetic Epidemiology
of HIV and TB drugs; 4) Immunopathogenesis of HIV-TB Co-infection and Disease; 5) HIV-TB Drug
Hypersensitivity: Clinical Epidemiology and Molecular/Immune Pathogenesis Research; and 6) the interaction
between HIV and COVID-19: Clinical Epidemiology and Immunology Research. We will award 15 fellowships (4
postdoctoral, 9 PhD, and 3 Master’s level), spread across the focus areas, with shared mentorship from the
partner institutions. Of these 15 fellowships, 10 will be targeted to emerging black researchers. We will offer the
following additional medium-term training opportunities: 3-10 month training periods at US institutions to learn a
laboratory or analytical method for 4 fellows; attendance at the JHU Graduate Summer Institute of Epidemiology
and Biostatistics for 4 fellows; and web-based epidemiology, biostatistics, and genetic epidemiology courses.
Short-term training will include short courses on topics including grant and protocol writing, epidemiology, and
biostatistics. We will hold monthly fellows seminars and an Annual Scientific Meeting. Seminars will include
fellows’ research updates, Responsible Conduct of Research training, and career coaching topics. A novel
aspect of our Program is the annual “Entry into HIV-TB research” symposium for medical students followed by
electives and ongoing contact, with the objective of having the most talented and motivated students return to
UCT to develop careers in HIV-TB research. The Program is led by Dr. Meintjes (PD/PI) with a Core
Administrative Committee and a Steering Committee representing all partner institutions. Oversight will be
provided by a Training Advisory Committee (TAC) chaired by Dr. Taryn Young (Stellenbosch University) with
three other members (Drs. Aliyu, Beyrer and Mizrahi). An annual structured evaluation process will assess
individual development and overall Program outputs, outcomes, and performance, and will involve a written
report to and feedback from the TAC, which the PI and committees will use to improve the Program."
10831454,"Project Summary
In this application, we propose to continue the aims of R25 AG053227 Genomics for Social Scientists by
offering two annual summer workshops, one a week-long introduction to genomics and another 4-day
workshop focused on epigenetics. This doubles the number of courses offered by including the epigenetics
course that was created with a recent supplement. In addition to an expanded series of online modules based
on aspects of the course we have found particularly well-suited to online instruction, these courses will build
the capacity of social and behavioral scientists to understand and conduct genomic (i.e. DNA, epigenetics,
telomere length, etc.) research using NIA-funded resources, such as the Health and Retirement Study (HRS),
The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), Northern Ireland Cohort for the Longitudinal study of Ageing
(NICOLA), and The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Our proposed R25
Research Education Program will expand the opportunity for social science researchers using these data to
integrate genomics into their research by 1) offering two annual in-person and virtual training workshops with a
hands-on lab component, 2) creating a series of online tutorials that can augment the workshop or serve as
stand-alone exercises, and 3) linking these custom tools with resources already available on the web (i.e.
facilitating more efficient use of resources typically unknown to most social scientists). The courses and
supporting material will focus on providing training for researchers working at the intersection of genomic and
social science research, using HRS data as a model, but broadly applicable to any social science study with
genomic data. We will cover a biological overview of genomics, collection of genomic material in population-
based studies, as well as an introduction to current quality control metrics and statistical methods for studying
human complex traits. Hands-on analysis is an integral part of each course and will utilize tutorial versions of
the HRS core survey data and files similar to the HRS genetic and epigenetic data files accessed using a
secure virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI). Our team consists of experts linking social science and genomic
data in their own aging research, including collecting, assaying, and analyzing genomic samples and data.
Moreover, this team has taught over 180 students in 7 different courses over the last 5 years. Evaluations of
the course have been very positive and each year the course material has improved and been modified to
better fit the needs of the students and stay up to date with developing methodologies. Students have
demonstrated tremendous potential for impact on the field publishing nearly 400 articles using genomic data
thus far. Ultimately our goal is that through discussion and by example we will focus on the unique aspects of
analyzing genetic and epigenetic data in combination with social science data to facilitate collaboration across
disciplines for the workshop attendees."
10831457,"Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide and places a heavy burden on the
economy in our society. Recently it has been recognized that ischemic stroke elicits a strong neuroinflammatory
response characterized by massive microglia and astrocytes activation and this excessive neuroinflammatory
response could affect the long-term outcome of stroke. The long-term goal of our lab is to understand key
components of the CNS that determine neuronal survival and neurorepair, to improve functional outcomes
from CNS injury or chronic neurological diseases. One of our research interests is to characterize how
microglia cells affect the function of astrocytes and eventually determines the survival of neurons under both
physiological and pathological conditions. TGF-β has recently been suggested as a key factor in the
maintenance of microglia homeostasis under physiological conditions in adult brain. However, its role
regulating injury-induced microglia and astrocyte responses during different stages of pathology development
has not been investigated. TGF-β pharmacological modulators (inhibitors and activators) have shown mixed
and conflicting results in stroke animal models, depending on the dosage and time of administration. These
findings emphasize the importance of precise temporal and cell type specific modulation of this pathway. To
precisely investigate the role of TGF-β signaling pathway in microglia maintenance and astrocyte crosstalk, we
have developed multiple cell-type specific and temporally inducible ligand or receptor conditional KO mice. Our
preliminary data indicates that TGF-β signaling is important in maintaining the resting CNS microglia signature
profile under physiological condition and ablation of TGF-β signaling in microglia not only prime microglia cells
to pre-inflammatory states, but also activate quiescent astrocytes. Utilizing novel inducible conditional KO mice
lines, we will test our central hypotheses that 1)TGF-β signaling is important in the homeostasis of microglia
function and its cross-talk with astrocytes under pathophysiological conditions and 2) that modulation of this
pathway will lead to altered CNS functional outcome. If successful, the knowledge that will be gained from this
proposal is not limited to stroke research but can also have broader impact on the role of TGF-β1 signaling in
neuroinflammation regulation and microglia-astrocyte crosstalk in other CNS diseases."

10832984,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Infectious corneal ulcers affect all ages and contribute to significant visual morbidity worldwide. Empiric
treatment with broad spectrum antimicrobials without regard for antimicrobial resistance is presently standard
of care. This is either because pathogen identification with routine microbiological testing is suboptimal or
testing is not done altogether. While empiric treatment is the preferred practice pattern for infectious keratitis
worldwide, this is contrary to the goals and ideals of antimicrobial stewardship. Here, we propose to enhance
the understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious keratitis and antibiotic resistance profiles to improve
diagnostics and therapeutics with the following aims. In the first aim, we will perform worldwide surveillance of
all organisms responsible for infectious keratitis. We expect the spectrum of etiology will vary significantly with
geographic location. In addition, seasonality will affect pathogen profile and disease outcomes. The second
aim will determine the frequency and richness of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in corneal ulcer pathogens
and correlate those findings with phenotypes. We expect AMR will differ by global location and predict clinical
outcome. Finally, we will define the local immune response in infectious keratitis. We hypothesize that immune
signatures can predict pathogen types and clinical outcome. Corneal opacity secondary to infectious keratitis
remains one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide and we anticipate this research will guide clinicians
on the best management for corneal infection to reduce both the financial and ocular health burden globally."

10837944,"Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is home to two-thirds of all people living with HIV (PLHIV). Widely-adopted targets
such as “95-95-95” (diagnosing ≥95% of PLHIV, treating ≥95% of those diagnosed, and achieving viral load
suppression in ≥95% of those on treatment) have fueled tremendous progress in access and effective use of
HIV treatment, with surveillance from Population HIV Impact Assessments (PHIAs) used to monitor progress.
Although these efforts have reduced HIV incidence and mortality, HIV/AIDS remains the leading cause of
death among SSA adults, and HIV incidence remains high, with many regions not on track to achieve the
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of HIV incidence <0.1% per person-year by 2030. Pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown to dramatically reduce HIV acquisition risk when taken as directed.
However, at a population level, PrEP use in SSA is still limited. Several modeling studies, including our own,
suggest the SDG could be achieved in much of SSA with sufficient expansions in PrEP access and use.
A challenge for PrEP expansion in SSA is the lack of established targets, and lack of surveillance to monitor
progress toward targets. Such target-setting-and-tracking approaches have been remarkably successful in
driving scale-up of HIV treatment and monitoring progress through PHIAs. Our central hypothesis is that PrEP
research data can be used to derive setting-specific PrEP coverage targets corresponding to incidence
reduction goals, which can be monitored using population-based drug measurements as a “PHIA for PrEP.”
Several innovations are needed to enable a “PHIA for PrEP.” First (Aim 1), the relationship between drug
concentrations measured and reduction in HIV incidence needs to be established. This was previously
accomplished for men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Global North. We will determine this relationship
using pooled PrEP study data from SSA, where transmission is predominantly heterosexual. Second (Aim 2),
the totality of the effects of PrEP program participation need to be understood, which may extend beyond the
pharmacological effects of PrEP drugs. Several studies have measured HIV incidence reductions among non-
adherent participants and those taking placebos, suggesting PrEP program participation may serve as a
“gateway” to behavioral risk reduction. We will estimate these effects using pooled study results from post-
licensure SSA PrEP pilots and demonstration projects. Third (Aim 3), PrEP target-setting needs to account for
differential HIV risk across population groups and settings. We will use agent-based HIV transmission
modeling to estimate a range of PrEP coverage configurations that achieve epidemic targets, with trade-offs
between coverage vs. adherence and between overall coverage vs. targeting those most-at-risk. Cognizant of
stigma, accessibility, and other challenges, we will engage policy-makers, advocates, community advisory
boards, as well as experts in HIV trials, surveys, and bioethics, to weigh PrEP target options and design
monitoring strategies using a “PHIA for PrEP.”"
10839999,"Summary
 Despite decades of research into targeted therapeutics against gliomas, the most successful treatments
remain DNA damaging agents: radiation and the alkylating agents temozolomide and lomustine. DNA damage
generates particular obstacles for rapidly dividing cells; as cells undergoing such damage progress through the
cell cycle, they can undergo genotoxic or mitotic catastrophe. Multiple compounds have recently been developed
that interfere with cell cycle regulation, with the aim of generating mitotic catastrophe in cancer cells. These
include compounds targeting regulators of the G2/M checkpoint, including CHK1 and CHK2; WEE1; and others.
Some of these are being applied to gliomas in clinical trials, including a trial of the WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 in
patients with glioblastoma. However, a detailed understanding of which gliomas are most likely to require a
functional G2/M checkpoint, and under what conditions, is not available. Therefore, despite this pathway being
highly relevant to the most successful existing therapeutics, we do not know when or how to use modulators of
the pathway in patients with glioma. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether and in what instances
inhibitors of the G2/M checkpoint, and particularly CHK1/2, can lead to improved outcomes in gliomas. We
evaluated the effects of 400 biologically active small molecules on 78 glioma cell lines with comprehensive
genomic characterization, including conventional and neurosphere lines. One of the most prominent outcomes
was that inactivation of TP53 was associated with worse response to almost all compounds, but combined loss
of TP53 and CDKN2A/B rendered cells more sensitive to G2/M checkpoint inhibitors, especially inhibitors of
CHK1/2 (CHK1/2i). We hypothesize that combined loss of TP53 and other G1/S cell cycle regulators leads to a
reliance on the CHK1/2-controlled G2/M checkpoint to avoid uncontrolled cell cycling in the context of genotoxic
or replicative stress. By understanding the mechanisms underlying G2/M inhibitor sensitivity, we will have
potential for a major near-term impact on treatment through optimized therapeutic strategies using these
inhibitors, which are already under development, that can lead to immediate incorporation into new clinical trials
strategies. We will achieve this with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that combined loss
of TP53 and G1/S checkpoint control generates sensitivity to G2/M checkpoint inhibitors. Aim 2: Test the
hypothesis that cell differentiation state determines sensitivity to G2/M checkpoint inhibition. Aim 3: Test the
hypothesis that MDM2 inhibitors can increase the therapeutic window of CHK1/2i in the context of DNA damaging
agents. In summary, the proposal described should lead to better diagnostics and treatments for those afflicted
by gliomas and offer new avenues for clinical trial design and implementation in patient studies."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an ever-growing socio-economic burden across the globe. Oligomerized amyloid-b
peptide (Ab) and hyper-phosphorylated tau are the pathological hallmarks of the disease and a key piece of the
neurodegenerative cascade that leads to symptoms. To develop effective oligomer targeting therapies, we must
fully describe the biochemical attributes of the target. The objective of this grant is to link oligomer structural
components to toxic bioactivity and delineate the steps in the AD neurodegenerative cascade. The central
hypothesis is that by using AD patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) cultured as cerebrocortical
organoids, we can recreate the AD niche closely enough to produce brain-like Ab and tau oligomers and to
understand cell type specific responses to oligomer exposure. Our rationale is that the cell type in which a protein
is made heavily impacts its function and so to fully recapitulate AD in vitro, you must model the human brain.
Our AD patient derived iPSC model will capture the important genetic and tissue specific elements to support
Ab/tau oligomerization and intercellular communication networks. Our specific aims will test the following
hypotheses: (Aim 1) AD patient iPSC grown as cerebrocortical organoids recreate the AD niche and produce
bioactive Ab and tau oligomers; (Aim 2) Through toxicity screening on iPSC derived neurons and glia
independently, we will discover the primary and secondary cellular responders to Ab and tau oligomer exposure;
(Aim 3) Not every cell is exposed to Ab and tau oligomers directly and yet there is wide spread degeneration.
Subpopulation oligomer exposure in an AD-organoid will uncover the intercellular communication networks
that causes this phenomenon. Upon conclusion, we will understand the structural components that make Ab and
tau oligomers bioactive, what the main oligomer responding cell types are, and how intercellular communication
upon oligomer exposure of some cells, effects all the cells in the niche. This contribution is significant because a
new, reliable, and relevant source of Ab and tau oligomers is needed by the community for large scale studies.
Currently used post-mortem brain tissue is scarce and due to the high lipid content, difficult to use as a source
material. Further, by biochemically defining a bioactive Ab and tau oligomer, therapeutics can be designed to
specifically target it. This research will also establish which cell types in the disease niche are the primary and
secondary responders to Ab and tau oligomers. By examining oligomer response in both stem cell derived brain
cell types in isolation and in the organoid niche, we will establish the steps in the neurotoxic AD cascade. The
proposed research is innovative because we will illustrate a new use for patient derived stem cells as a reliable
source for bioactive oligomers. This finding can be extrapolated to other diseases such as Parkinson's disease
and its related a-synuclein protein aggregates. Additionally, we have designed a new use for RNA drop
sequencing to multiplex oligomer uptake tracking and single cell transcriptomics through a nucleotide barcoding
strategy."

 The primary cilium is a Ca2+-privileged, antenna-like cellular organelle found in all organ systems of the
human body. The importance of primary cilia are highlighted by the growing number of renal ciliopathies—
many of which are caused by mutations in Ca2+ signaling effector genes. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney
disease (ADPKD) is a fatal renal ciliopathy that can be caused by mutations in the PKD2 Ca2+ channel. Despite 20
years since determining its genetic cause, we do not know how ADPKD mutations alter PKD2 channel function
and if Ca2+ dysregulation in the primary cilium contributes to kidney cyst formation. These basic questions
remain outstanding because PKD2 localizes to the enigmatic primary cilium—which requires innovative tools to
study. To this end, our lab has developed novel assays to study ciliary Ca2+ signaling and PKD2 channel
dysregulation caused by ADPKD mutations in real-time, at super- and atomic resolution.
 In the cilia of the collecting duct, PKD2 regulated by internal Ca2+ is bimodal. When ciliary Ca2+ is elevated
to micromolar concentrations, open probability of PKD2 increases (CDM) and over time becomes desensitized
(CDD). However, molecular mechanism for both processes are unknown. Recently, we published a refutation
of the hypothesis that C-terminal EF hands of PKD2 is involved in channel regulation and ADPKD progression. In
our unpublished preliminary data, we identified a new Ca2+ binding site in the voltage sensor domain (VSDCa-
site), where several ADPKD-causing mutations aggregate. We hypothesize that mutations at this site may
cause either a loss- or gain-of-channel-function, depending on their functional impact on CDM and CDD. We
have devised specific aims to define the Ca2+-dependent molecular regulation of PKD2, while assessing the
impact of ADPKD mutations. There is no drug cure for ADPKD. Thus, assessing mechanistic differences between
mutations is essential for designing future ADPKD treatment strategies. We will also test the “ciliary Ca2+
hypothesis of cystogenesis” by assessing the impact of VSDCa-site mutations on cilia Ca2+ dynamics and
downstream gene expression in ADPKD patient cells. We will then determine if corrective PKD2 gene editing
(CRISPR/Cas9) can reinstate normal ciliary Ca2+ and gene transcription. The aims proposed will test our limited
understanding of how channel dysregulation in the primary cilia initiates cyst development in the kidney.
Beyond ADPKD, ciliopathies which primarily other impact other organ systems, frequently exhibit kidney cysts
as comorbidities. Thus, the findings from this proposal may extend to other renal ciliopathies, where aberrant
cilia-to-cell Ca2+ transduction is a possible unifying signaling mechanism."

LOAD FBS) has recruited, assessed and followed 1,756 families multiply affected by late-onset Alzheimer’s
Disease (AD), with 9,682 family members, and we have assessed and followed 1,096 unrelated, nondemented
elderly. Of these 7,925 (82%) have DNA, and 7,014 (88.5%) of those have genome wide SNP array data. 1,340
(76%) of the families have either whole exome or whole genome sequencing. The families are racially/ethnically
diverse: 181 (10.3%) are African American, 425 (24.2%) are Latinx, 138 (7.8%) are listed as “other” (mostly
Asian) and 1,012 are white non-Hispanic. 67,626 biological samples have been distributed and 830 national
and international investigators have used either data or samples in over 122 publications from the NIA-LOAD
FBS, including the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium and the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project.
Detailed autopsy reports exist for 181 individuals, but we have completed brain autopsy in 655 from which fresh
brain tissue in 398 (61%) are undergoing bulk RNA sequencing and DNA methylation from the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex. We have collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 322 individuals during
the follow-up visits of family members. We will continue to expand resources to support functional genomics by
increasing biospecimen collections including additional DNA, plasma, PBMCs and postmortem brain tissue
stored at the National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders for distribution to
AD researchers, facilitating molecular profiling instrumental to prediction models that identify drug targets. During
the COVID-19 pandemic, we relied on telecommunication methods for follow-up and recruitment and will expand
this effort in the renewal. We will also add blood-based biomarkers Ab42, Ab40, total tau (T-tau), neurofilament
light chain and phosphorylated tau 217 (P-tau217) to improve the precision of clinical diagnoses.
 The principal investigators of this U24-Resource Related Cooperative Agreement were asked to extend
recruitment to familial early-onset AD (EOAD) and their adult children. EOAD represents the younger boundary
of the entire age spectrum of AD and is only partially explained by mutations in the APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2.
We have added an investigative team that has already begun recruiting EOAD families and their family members.
 Our multigenerational approach to the study of AD offers an ideal opportunity to determine the penetrance
and heritability of the genetic variants identified in these diverse families. These data will inform and guide
international genetic studies. The return of individual genetic and biomarker results in a research study is a
challenging task due to the ethical and practical complexity. We will be informed by the recommendations of NIA
working groups regarding the return of research results. The goals of this renewal are to provide a rich genetic
and biomarker resource for the scientific community. We have renamed the project as NIA-AD FBS to include
the entire age spectrum of AD onset."

This renewal application requests twelve training slots to support graduate students in the Harvard Therapeutics
Graduate Program (TGP) during their second and/or third year of training. Demographic trends are increasing
the need for targeted drug treatments, and there is growing optimism for treating historically untreatable diseases
based on recent scientific developments in areas such as inflammation and the emergence of new drug
modalities such as antibodies and oligonucleotides. Many research schools and hospitals are building
translational research centers, often in collaboration with local industry, and these need to recruit well-trained
faculty and PhD-level staff. The biopharma industry has exploded in Massachusetts in the last decade, and many
PhD-level positions remain unfilled. The TGP seeks to train the next generation of leaders in these fields and
recruits students from all 13 Harvard Integrated Life Sciences (HILS) PhD programs to build a diverse and
inclusive community of scholars committed to translational biomedical research and development. Our program
consists of a robust required core curriculum, paracurricular activities focused on professional skills
development, and a signature required internship, where students spend 2–4 months in an industrial or
regulatory science setting, usually by the end of their 4th year. Through these programmatic elements, trainees
receive exceptional intellectual, practical, and professional skills development focused on the science of drug
discovery, evaluation, and equitable clinical use and distribution. Paramount to our training goals is a strong
emphasis on research rigor, reproducibility, and the ethical conduct of science. TGP faculty, recruited from
multiple HMS and Harvard programs, including the Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS), Chemical Biology,
and Systems Biology graduate programs at Harvard Medical School (HMS), Harvard University, and the HMS-
affiliated teaching hospitals, will be evaluated for the scientific relevance of their research, their mentoring skills,
and their commitment to student-centric training experiences. Central to our mission is to help diversify the
biomedical research pipeline and add intellectual diversity to research endeavors. The TGP boosts resilience of
minoritized student groups through career preparedness, and highlights the importance of translational research
in health equity and social justice. Furthermore, trainees are granted access to many industry professionals and
networking opportunities in our courses, paracurricular activities, and the required internship. In conjunction with
institutional efforts, our training platform helps to bend the arc of graduate training towards student-centric
modalities and train future scholars to be pioneers in therapeutic science."

This application is a renewal of our aging-related Integrative Physiology of Aging T32, which is currently in
its 20th year. The overall objective is to continue research training efforts on both the University of Colorado
Anschutz Medical Campus (CU-AMC) and the University of Colorado-Boulder Campus (CU-B). As with the
previous funding cycle, the major participating programs will be the Division of Geriatric Medicine (DGM), the
Department of Integrative Physiology (IPHY) at CU-B and the VA Eastern Colorado Geriatric Research,
Education, and Clinical Center (GRECC). Because we are the only T32 out of 50+ institutional training grants
(T32, TL1, KL2, K12) at CU-AMC/CU-B that specifically focuses on aging physiology, we are requesting
support for 5 predoctoral and 5 postdoctoral trainees each year, similar to the previous award. The specific
objectives of this training program are to continue to: 1) expand the participating faculty and create an even
more collaborative and effective mentoring group in support of age-related research at CU-AMC, CU-B and
Eastern Colorado GRECC; 2) recruit, select, support and retain high quality predoctoral and postdoctoral (MD
and PhD) trainees, with a continued emphasis on attracting underrepresented minorities (URM), women,
disabled, and individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds; 3) support experiential and didactic research
training opportunities in the integrative physiology of aging, including methods for enhancing reproducibility
(e.g., consideration of Sex as a Biological Variable); 4) support the “T-shaped Team Training” (T3) program for
trainees (and mentors); 5) monitor, support and ensure successful progress of trainees using predetermined
milestones, defined in their individual Career Development Plan (CDP); and 6) enhance the mentoring skills of
junior “associate mentors” through co-mentoring with a “primary mentor” and participation in the T3 program.
These objectives will be carried out by offering: 1) up to 2 years of research training support (the second years
dependent upon successful progress); 2) dual mentoring by outstanding primary and associate mentors; 3) a
variety of relevant classroom/research experiences on both campuses and team science training programs; 4)
frequent and careful review of trainee progress/success; 5) ongoing appraisal of the program goals, strength
and weaknesses; and 6) sound financial and administrative oversight. Our previous success is demonstrated
by our ability to: 1) fill all of our positions with outstanding trainees; 2) produce academically successful and
productive trainees; 3) build a pipeline of mentors, by transitioning trainees to associate mentors and associate
mentors to primary mentors; and 4) expand aging-research across campuses through ongoing collaboration
among the participating programs and faculty."
10857322,"Project Summary & Abstract
Advance in sequencing technology and computational algorithms revealed various alternative splicing
variations in cancer transcriptome. Although several common classes of splicing events, such as exon
skipping, intron retention and alternative splice sites, have been linked to tumor progression and therapy
resistance, the roles of many non-canonical splicing events in cancer remain unknown due to the lack of
dedicated approaches to detect and characterize these events. This proposal will focus on exitron splicing
events because emerging evidence revealed they are dysregulated in cancer and occurred frequently in
cancer-related genes. An exitron is an internal region within a coding exon that has splicing potential to create
a cryptic intron. Splicing of exitron results in protein isoforms with altered sequences that may affect functional
domains and post-translational modification sites. The observations of exitron splicing occurred in cancer
genes suggest that exitron-spliced isoforms may contribute to cancer development. Furthermore, tumor-
specific exitron splicing junctions resulting internal deletions or frameshifts may generate immunogenic
peptides (i.e., neoantigens) that could form a basis for developing cancer vaccines or T-cell therapeutic
targets. In this proposal, we will develop customized computational methods and conduct integrative multi-
omics analysis with the goal to uncover the regulation of exitron splicing, driver exitron splicing events and
neoantigens derived from tumor-specific exitrons in cancers. (Aim 1) We will develop an integrated framework
to detect and validate exitrons with joint analysis of multi-omics data generated by multiple sequencing
platforms. We will identify splicing factors that preferentially affect exitron splicing in cancers. (Aim 2) We will
develop novel statistical approaches to identify genes and pathways enriched with exitron splicing alterations.
We will implement a semi-supervised machine learning model to predict exitron splicing-associated cancer
driver genes based on transcriptomic features. (Aim 3) We will develop a computational tool to identify splicing-
derived neoantigens and validate them through mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidome data. We will
assess the association of exitron splicing-derived neoantigens with clinical outcomes in patients receiving
immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This project will provide a unique computational platform for dedicated
exitron splicing analyses. The knowledge gained from this proposed study will help to understand the
underlying mechanisms by which exitron alterations promote cancer progression. We expect that these
analyses will be rapidly translated into clinical utility by providing new approaches to predict patient response in
immune checkpoint inhibition therapies."

The goal of this project is to provide training and education in human genomics-related topics to the entry-level
biomedical workforce, and in particular, to individuals from underrepresented and disadvantaged populations.
Entry-level training in human genomics is critical for creating diverse teams of individuals who can be active
participants in genomic medicine. In response to this ongoing need, The Jackson Laboratory (JAX), in
partnership with Connecticut State Colleges and Universities (CSCU), proposes a curriculum development
initiative, Genomics in Action, for community college students that will impart content knowledge and skills in
genetics and genomics to better prepare them for a variety of careers, such as laboratory, medical and nursing
assistants. Community college students within the CSCU system are a highly diverse group, with approximately
50% of students receiving financial assistance and 50% of students from minoritized populations. To achieve
our objective, we propose the following Aims: 1. Develop 15 virtual modules on key topics in human
genomics, tailored to community college student needs. These modules will address curricular gaps as
identified through needs analysis with our CSCU faculty. Our innovative approach will utilize short video content
to introduce topics, demonstrate concepts, as well as provide context for each topic within a career or job in the
genomics workforce. Each module will feature a near-peer who is employed in a role for which community college
students are training. The modules will thus be designed to connect the genomics content and skills directly to
application in the workplace. 2. Disseminate fully digital modules to the broader community. Our team will
design modules that can be seamlessly integrated into our CSCU partner institutions learning management
systems, and professional development workshops will be provided to facilitate adoption the Genomics in Action
modules among the broader CSCU community. We will also expand dissemination through JAX’s online and
digital education program that provides free access to our interactive multimedia educational content, making
the modules available for use globally. To evaluate the impact of the Genomics in Action modules, pilot adoption
will take place during year 1 of the project and surveys will be administered to assess the effectiveness of the
module delivery and usability by both faculty and students. Modules will be adapted, refined, and subsequently
delivered in courses again in years 2 and 3. We will examine overall uptake and use of the modules by our
partner institutions and will track broader dissemination within other programs and institutions within the CSCU.
Program impact will also be assessed by tracking learners’ career progress and retention in biomedicine
following program participation. By training community college students seeking entry-level positions, Genomics
in Action will execute on NIH’s goal of strengthening the future STEM workforce through increasing genomic and
health literacy."
10834946,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our long-term goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that restructure the genome to allow for the
transition from a specified cell type to a pluripotent state. During the initial stages of embryonic development, the
genomes of the specified germ cells are rapidly and efficiently reprogrammed to generate the pluripotent cells of
the early embryo. Many features are shared between the efficient reprogramming that occurs in the early embryo
and the much less efficient reprogramming that occurs in culture. The capacity to generate pluripotent stem cells
has great potential in the modelling and treatment of disease. Understanding the fundamental molecular
mechanisms that drive reprogramming will have important implications in our ability to rapidly and reproducibly
induce the pluripotent state. Both in culture and in the early embryo, reprogramming requires the activity of
specialized transcription factors, termed pioneer factors. Pioneer factors are distinctive in that, unlike other
transcription factors, they can bind to DNA in the context of nucleosomes. This feature allows them unique
access to the genome and helps to redefine the chromatin accessibility landscape. Nonetheless, it remains
unclear what specific functions of pioneer factors are required to drive reprogramming and what the barriers are
to pioneer factor-mediated reprogramming. In Drosophila the transcription factor Zelda is required for the initial
transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome. We have demonstrated that Zelda possesses essential features
of pioneer transcription factors and that this activity is required throughout the process of zygotic genome
activation. However, Zelda is unlikely to be working independently, and we have implicated another pioneering
factor, GAGA factor, as functioning together with Zelda to define accessible chromatin domains in the early
embryo. By combining our development of novel tools to interrogate transcription factor function in the early
embryo with the strengths of the well-studied fly system, we are uniquely positioned to determine essential
features of reprogramming. We will use genetic, genomic, biochemical, and imaging strategies to 1) define how
pioneering factors cooperate to reprogram the zygotic genome, 2) identify chromatin barriers to pioneer factor-
mediated reprogramming and 3) determine the role of intrinsically disordered regions in establishing chromatin
domains in the early embryo. Our proposed research is significant because by defining essential characteristics
of pioneering transcription factors we will identify unifying principles required for efficient reprogramming of
specified cells to pluripotency."
10834947,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Withdrawal is a key, multi-faceted component of tobacco/nicotine dependence. Because withdrawal
symptoms are theorized to drive relapse, facets of withdrawal (e.g., craving, negative affect) are the
targets of most current and emerging treatments. Despite the central importance of withdrawal, and a
voluminous literature on withdrawal from combustible cigarette smoking, we know little about
withdrawal from electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). To overcome critical barriers to
progress in the field, we propose the first-ever prospective, controlled comparison of abstinence-
induced withdrawal between ENDS vapers and cigarette smokers. Participants will be 160 established
daily vapers (including former smokers and dual users who smoke occasionally), 160 established
daily smokers (including former vapers and dual users who vape occasionally), and (for exploratory
comparisons) 50 established daily dual users, who smoke and vape daily. Participants will complete
two 4-hour lab visits; the order of the ad lib use visit and the abstinent visit (which follows 24 hours of
abstinence) will be randomized across participants. To advance knowledge of ENDS withdrawal, we
will employ state-of-the-science, multi-measure, multi-method assessments of key withdrawal facets:
negative affect, craving, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, sleep, and appetite, as well as
anhedonia/positive affect and somatic effects. We hypothesize that, for each facet, withdrawal
magnitude will be lower among vapers compared to smokers. To inform theory and intervention
development, we will also evaluate the behavioral significance of ENDS withdrawal, testing the
hypotheses that abstinence will increase the motivation to vape/smoke and this group difference will
be accounted for (mediated) by vaper/smoker differences in one or more withdrawal facets.
Exploratory analyses will examine whether group differences in withdrawal are accounted for
(mediate) by differential nicotine exposure, explore the role of individual differences (e.g., sex, rate of
nicotine metabolism, expectancies), and examine differences among sub-groups of vapers. The impact
of this much-needed, detailed characterization of withdrawal from ENDS is enhanced by the inclusion
of a comparator of great public health significance, cigarette smoking. In addition, by characterizing
the specific withdrawal facets that drive motivation to vape/smoke, the proposed work will identify
promising intervention targets for subsequent treatment development efforts."

COVID-19 are experiencing cardiopulmonary symptoms months after the acute illness, referred to as Post-
Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) or “Long COVID”. Given the frequency of cardiovascular injury during
COVID-19 and the persistence of symptoms for extended periods after the acute illness, there is an urgent
need for studies of the late effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the cardiovascular system. We aim to investigate the
central hypothesis that immune responses to severe COVID-19 cause acute inflammation and injury that result
in clinically relevant myocardial fibrosis and dysfunction over the long-term. Since August 2020, we have been
enrolling patients in a COVID-19 Immune Profiling (IP) Study, which includes a protocol to collect blood
specimens from patients with COVID-19 at admission, during hospitalization, 1-3 months, and 3-12 months
after recovery. We will co-enroll participants from this study and perform cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
(CMR) and additional functional cardiopulmonary assessments at 3-12 months and 2-3 years after recovery.
Our specific aims include, Aim 1) Identify innate immune profiles during severe COVID-19 that predict long-
term cardiac damage. We will focus innate immunity measures in blood specimens collected at admission and
early recovery, Aim 2) Establish whether adaptive immune responses contribute to cardiac injury after COVID-
19. We will quantify responses targeting SARS-CoV-2 as well as explore maladaptive responses targeting
cardiac proteins. Analysis of blood specimens will be supplemented with exploratory studies of cardiac tissue,
and Aim 3) Determine the long-term structural and functional cardiac abnormalities after severe COVID-19.
This includes characterization of cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, and clinical
symptoms. Comparisons will be made with control participants who had influenza infection 1-2 years prior. Our
proposal responds to urgent need for science characterizing long-term cardiac complications following COVID-
19. Our collaborative team has extensive experience spanning cardiology, infectious disease, immunology,
and epidemiology, and will be led by a cardiologist with expertise in CMR and inflammatory cardiomyopathies,
and an infectious diseases specialist with expertise in cardiovascular complications in the context of chronic
viral infections. Successful completion of our work will help understand the long-term cardiovascular effects of
severe COVID-19 illness. This knowledge could, in turn, help enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness
and disability in COVID-19 survivors."

Dementias from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and age-related cognitive impairments are a major health and socio-
economic concern in the US and worldwide. AD remains resistant to treatment based on earlier research efforts.
Approximately 20% of the US population will be 65 or older by year 2030; roughly 8 million of these individuals
are expected to suffer from AD. The neural circuit aspects of AD are an emerging new research area with
tremendous potential for growth and progress. The UC Irvine Center for Neural Circuit Mapping (CNCM)
research program has quickly established strong federal funding that supports our transformational projects with
significant clinical translational potential. The ongoing acceleration of our understanding of the nervous system
will drive the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat AD and other brain diseases over the next
decades. Our new CNCM research program has unified multidisciplinary investigators from multiple academic
units across UC Irvine including the Schools of Medicine, Biological Sciences, Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical
Sciences, Engineering, and Information and Computer Science. Our T32 program is designed to train the next
generation of researchers focused on neural circuit studies of brain disorders including AD and related
dementias. The proposed training program will be administered by the CNCM and will be supported by CNCM
investigators who have fostered a highly collaborative environment exemplifying interdisciplinary team-based
research. Our exciting and diverse group of faculty members will mentor and support predoctoral and
postdoctoral trainees in neural circuit studies using a range of interdisciplinary approaches combining analysis
of mouse genetic models and post-mortem human brain tissues with state-of-the-art technologies that include
viral genetic mapping, in vivo neural ensemble recording/imaging, single-cell genomics, engineering and
computational modeling. Our faculty mentors and trainees will expand our mechanistic understanding of
Alzheimer’s disease and other disorders and develop tools that enable early detection and diagnosis. Our
training plan is well defined; trainees are required to take courses and seminars related to cutting-edge
neuroscience and AD research with a neural circuit focus. We anticipate four trainees per year (2 pre- and 2
postdocs) whose training will continue until they complete their respective programs. Critically, we will teach our
trainees to develop their own unique tools and methodologies to address scientific questions that others cannot.
We include training in rigor and reproducibility, statistics and data analysis training, and professional
development. The expected outcome of our T32 program is to establish a successful training pipeline to prepare
trainees with career-long experimental and quantitative skills as future research leaders who will focus on neural
circuit analysis of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias."

The Howard Schneiderman Interdisciplinary Training Program in Learning and Memory is based at the University
of California - Irvine Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory (CNLM), a top-ranked and highly
visible organized research unit established in 1983 by the UC Regents with James L. McGaugh as its Founding
Director. The Center’s interdisciplinary faculty are working to achieve a complete and integrated understanding
of how the brain stores and remembers information across all levels from molecules to mind. Of the Center’s
more than 90 active research faculty, 21 are the core training faculty for this program, representing strengths in
molecular, cellular, circuit, systems, cognitive and computational neuroscience of learning and memory. The
program’s goal continues to be to train the next generation of innovative leaders in neuroscience by empowering
them with the skills, knowledge, and team science core values necessary to comprehensively understand the
neural basis of learning and memory. The program is aimed at predoctoral trainees with five slots offered every
year and an average duration of appointment of less than 2 years. It features 10 key components that provide
unique education training in the range of skills required for a successful research career in learning and memory:
(1) a problem-focused seminar course that promotes transdisciplinary and divergent thinking in learning and
memory; (2) a course on neural dynamics and computation; (3) a workshop on transdisciplinary team science;
(4) workshops on research-intensive academic careers (Life Skills for the Academic); (5) a series of workshops
on quantitative approaches to scientific inquiry; (6) a workshop on cultivating inclusion in the academy; (7)
participating in journal clubs; (8) participating in professional development, networking, and conference travel
activities; (9) participating in T32 program retreats; and (10) participating in mentoring meetings. The activities
fulfill many of the advanced requirements for coursework and do not increase time to degree completion. The
program also provides ample opportunities for leadership and service, as well as value added beyond the T32
trainees to extend to other students in the same laboratories. We focus on empowering mentors with training
and skills through Culturally Aware Mentor (CAM) Training and continue to use our joint preceptorship program
to train junior mentors. The overall training program leverages the existing resources and activities in UCI’s
graduate training, adds new training components that are unique to trainees of this program, and provides a host
of optional activities for professional development. Desired outcomes include successful completion of PhD,
published manuscripts, quantified improvement in transdisciplinary thinking and behavior, individual fellowships
(e.g. NRSA), successful placement in postdoctoral training, and subsequent career in research-intensive or
research-related areas. With several value-added components, this training program will continue to successfully
prepare our trainees to be future leaders in the neurobiology of learning and memory."

10853751,"Project Summary/Abstract
In-vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) can non-invasively measure levels of more than 20
biochemicals in the human brain. With its ability to detect surrogate markers of neuronal health and cell
proliferation, neurotransmitters, antioxidants, tumor markers and others, 1H-MRS provides a unique window onto
metabolic changes in health and disease. It therefore holds great potential for clinical research, diagnosis, and
treatment response monitoring.
Clinical translation of MRS has been curbed by the wide range of available technical methods for data acquisition
and analysis. These have often produced inconsistent results. Recent research has particularly recognized that
metabolite level estimates depend strongly on the way that the measured data are modeled. Traditional 1H-MRS
analysis procedures do not capture this uncertainty, and there are currently no methods to determine whether
one model is preferable over another.
The core theme of this project is a paradigm shift: fitting the measured data with a set of multiple candidate
models will replace traditional single-model analysis. A multiverse analysis framework will then capture and
quantify the variability across the candidate models, particularly focusing on currently existing MRS software.
Model selection tools, in contrast, will use statistical information criteria to actively discriminate which models are
the most suitable for a given dataset. These twin strategies (simultaneous consideration of multiple candidate
models and data-driven identification of the ‘best’ models) are complementary and provide practical tools to
boost the accuracy and precision of metabolite measurement. Clinical and research utility of the new strategies
are further amplified by interfacing them with stochastic Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. These methods
allow model parameter distributions to be characterized more accurately, providing alternative means of
uncertainty estimation that eliminate many weaknesses of traditional Cramer-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLB).
The project will further demonstrate that these new methods improve the accuracy and precision of non-invasive
measurement of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), a highly specific oncometabolite that plays a pivotal role in IDH-
mutated low-grade glioma.
In summary, this project proposes several novel data analysis strategies for in-vivo 1H-MRS that address the
challenge of analytic variability associated with the choice of modeling approach. All developed software code
will be made available to the community through our well-established open-source software ‘Osprey’."
10853668,"Most chronic subcortical stroke survivors have difficulty walking, but few predictors can help identify if a patient
will respond to an exercise regimen and improve their function. To enhance precision rehabilitation for chronic
subcortical stroke patients, personalized aerobic exercise interventions are crucial. This requires the
development of innovative technologies that can identify the essential neurobiological factors to predict
intervention response and enable clinicians to determine individualized rehabilitation targets. Lactate is one
exciting new target that acts as a molecular messenger between the periphery and the brain. In order for lactate
to have an impact on other organs, including the brain, it is essential that there is a substantial increase in its
level in the bloodstream from baseline. When the blood lactate threshold is surpassed during exercise, lactate
acts on the brain metabolically via the TCA cycle. Embedded within the TCA cycle is the means to increase or
decrease neurotransmitter concentrations such as GABA and glutamate. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA),
the brain's major inhibitory neurotransmitter, is a new treatment target that promotes neural plasticity during
stroke rehabilitation. Drawing from the framework of personalized rehabilitation approaches and our preliminary
data, we propose to build a predictive model that can identify if a chronic subcortical stroke patient will respond
to exercise training. This model aims to predict improvements in walking speed by incorporating blood lactate as
an early predictor of exercise response and GABA and cerebral blood flow (CBF) as predictors of the brain’s
potential to respond, in addition to other influencing factors such as comorbidities, demographics, and fitness
levels. The overarching hypothesis is that robust neurophysiological factors driven by lactate can differentiate
responders from resistors and that these factors can be applied clinically as biomarkers to predict functional
outcomes after a 12-week HIIT intervention. We will assess improvements in walking speed in 48 Veterans with
lower limb disability due to chronic subcortical stroke in response to a 36-session (12-week) HIIT intervention.
After the intervention, each adherent participant who improves their walking speed to greater than 0.6 m/s will
be categorized as a responder while each adherent participant who does not improve their walking speed will
be categorized as a resistor. At baseline and after 12 weeks of HIIT we will evaluate walking speed, balance, leg
strength, and endurance to identify resistors and responders to HIIT and collect a) GABA from the primary
sensory-motor leg area using single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy, b) CBF from the whole brain using
pseudo-Continuous Arterial Spin Labeling MRI and c) VO2 max to evaluate change in CRF. During the
intervention, we will collect blood lactate via finger prick during sessions 1, 4, 7, 10, and 28 to assess its potential
as an early predictor of exercise response. In aim 1 we determine if surpassing the lactate threshold during the
first 4 weeks of HIIT predicts the change in walking speed to ≥0.6 m/s, from pre- to post-HIIT. If lactate proves
to be a robust early marker of functional response to exercise, we will have an easy-to-deploy predictor of who
will best benefit from HIIT. In aim 2 we will determine if (a) baseline GABA and/or CBF predict improvements in
walking speed from baseline to after HIIT and (b) if a change in GABA and/or CBF relate to a change in walking
speed. We aim to establish neurophysiological correlates of improving function with HIIT to better understand
the mechanisms. Finally, in aim 3 we will a predictive machine learning algorithm of who will improve their walking
speed with HIIT using factors of blood lactate, baseline GABA and CBF, baseline leg weakness and VO2-max,
pre-stroke fitness, age, sex, and comorbidities. The overarching objective is to develop a model to predict which
Veteran with chronic stroke will respond to a 12-week exercise program."
10842859,"This participatory, pragmatic efficacy-implementation trial evaluates the impact of Promoting Community
Conversations About Research to End Suicide (PC CARES) on adult participants and the adults and youth they
are ‘close to’, who we hypothesize will benefit from the intervention. For sustainability, the project also identifies
barriers and enablers to community implementation of PC CARES in rural Alaska Native (AN) communities.
Using a multilevel growth model, we examine the changes in suicide prevention knowledge, self-efficacy,
collaborations for a ‘community of practice’ (CoP) and prevention-oriented behaviors of adult PC CARES
participants (n=250) over time (7 timepoints), testing for moderating effects of dosage (e.g. #LCs attended),
community ‘readiness’; cross-sector participation on outcomes to inform future PC CARES implementation
(AIM#1). Over the same time periods in six randomly selected communities, our communitywide adult and youth
measures assess the community-level mechanisms of change (social diffusion), and for the first time, track youth
outcomes (AIM#2). We hypothesize that PC CARES will encourage adults to develop a collaborative
relationships within a CoP to implement upstream suicide prevention best practices (SPBPs) in support of youth
in their lives. Using community level social network measures, we document the number and type of interactions
reported by adults (n=450) over time, capturing social diffusion by comparing the knowledge, self-efficacy, CoP
and prevention-oriented behaviors of (1) PC CARES participants, (2) non-participants who are ‘close to’
participants and (3) others, unrelated to participants (comparison group). To assess youth impact (n=300, ages
12-19), we measure youth reported supportive adult interactions and connectedness (over 7 time points), and
pre-post perceived social support, family and community protective factors, comparing outcomes for youth who
are ‘close to’ participants versus 'unrelated' youth (comparison group). AIM#3 combines community-engaged
methodologies and evidence-based implementation science frameworks to examine the barriers and enablers
of PC CARES implementation in AN communities. The proposed study fulfills the priorities of the Intervention
Research to Improve Native American Health (PAR-17-496) because it: (1) tests the effectiveness of a promising
suicide prevention intervention developed with and for AN communities; (2) builds on cultural and community
knowledges as well as scientific best practices; (3) examines adult participant outcomes and diffusion at a
community level, (4) tracks the impact of adult prevention behaviors on youth-reported protective outcomes,
which promote mental health, safety and buffer suicide risk, and (5) by partnering with a successful educational
pathway for AN community mental health workers, our study of barriers and enablers of implementation will pave
the way for feasibly scaling PC CARES to other rural and remote AIAN communities who suffer disproportionately
from youth suicide. This project contributes to our long-term goal of translating suicide prevention research into
culturally-responsive community practice to reduce suicide risk and promote youth wellbeing in AN communities."
10842703,"SUMMARY-ABSTRACT
Dynamic oscillations in protein abundance represents the most salient molecular feature of cell cycle
progression. This is typified by the cyclins and cyclin kinase inhibitors (CKIs), that oscillate during cell cycle
progression and determine the activation kinetics of Cyclin Dependent Kinases, which propel the cell cycle
forward. Protein dynamics are not confined to kinase regulators, but rather are exhibited by hundreds of proteins,
including regulators of transcription, chromatin organization, cytoskeleton, and metabolism. Defining the
pathways, networks and mechanisms underlying these dynamics is essential to understanding proliferative
control. Cell cycle protein dynamics are controlled, in part, by the ubiquitin proteasome system. Ubiquitin is the
major regulator of protein degradation in eukaryotes and plays an essential and highly conserved role in cell
cycle. A cascade of enzymes coordinates the conjugation of ubiquitin onto substrates. However, E3 ligases are
the enzymes that ultimately determine when, where and who is ubiquitinated. Like other post-translational
modifications, ubiquitin is reversible, and can be removed from substrates by deubiquitinases (DUBs). Thus, the
countervailing activities of E3s and DUBs sculpts the proteome to regulate cell cycle progression and the
maintenance of genome integrity. The goal of my research is to define enzymes in the ubiquitin pathway that
control cell cycle, their cognate substrates, and how specific ubiquitination events contribute to cell cycle
progression. To address this goal, the proposed project seeks to address two fundamental questions, which
remain understudied. The first relates to key molecular events of G2-phase. Cells arrest in G2 in response to
stress and damage and utilize this time to make key decisions about whether to proliferate. However, G2 remains
the most poorly studied phase in the cell cycle. We uncovered a widespread program of protein degradation that
occurs in G2 and G2/M, and which is regulated by the activity of the multi-functional kinase PLK1. The identity
and timing of substrate degradation, the E3 ligases involved, and the consequences of this regulation are almost
entirely unstudied. The second question relates to the role of DUBs in cell cycle, which relative to the E3s they
antagonize, remain vastly understudied. Using computational and proteomic methods we identified DUBs with
understudied roles in cell cycle. We are determining their enzyme kinetics and preferences, substrates,
mechanisms of action, and structures when bound to E3 counterparts. We pursue these questions using a
combination of cell, molecular and biochemical assays, combined with proteomics and cryo-electron microscopy.
Collectively, addressing these questions will identify new regulatory pathways that control cell cycle, proliferative
decision making, and the maintenance of genome integrity."
10845692,"Lung transplantation is a potentially life extending treatment for patients with end stage lung diseases;
however, lung transplant is a relatively new field, and long-term outcomes are disappointing with a median
survival of ~6 years.2 Furthermore, among those who survive, half suffer from impaired lung function - chronic
lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) – which causes distressing symptoms and disability.3 Yet, fundamental
knowledge gaps persist in the understanding of the clinical and biological processes that occur after lung
transplantation; advancing such knowledge is critical to improve long-term outcomes.
The Lung Transplant Outcomes Group (LTOG) is the first and largest multicentered epidemiologic study in
lung transplantation designed to address issues surrounding early post-transplant complications. LTOG began
as an 11-center prospective cohort study formed in 2007. Initially, LTOG focused on the clinical mechanisms
and biomarkers for the early post-transplant complication of primary graft dysfunction (PGD), a serious
condition that often leads to early graft failure and death. Over 3000 subjects have been enrolled in the LTOG
during the past ten years. In this application, we aim to extend follow up of the LTOG and capitalize on this rich
resource of clinical data, biosamples, and infrastructure to address fundamental but previously unanswerable
questions about the long term outcomes of lung transplantation. We will have two aims focused on major long-
term issues key to lung transplant patient outcomes: in Aim 1 we will perform long-term CLAD phenotyping of
all subjects enrolled in the LTOG until death or study end using current state-of-the-art definitions; and in Aim 2
we will determine the long term functional status of the recipient including targeted measures of frailty domains
and functioning, disability, and health-related quality of life.
Our proposal is significant in that it will create a unique resource capable of generating tremendous new
knowledge in a growing field, both directly as a result of data in hand and by facilitating new research on
NHLBI-relevant lung diseases. It is innovative in generation of a novel data source at a low cost by leveraging
a unique established cohort, and in efficient data practices. It is impactful in developing new knowledge that
may change transplant practices worldwide by merging long-term graft and patient phenotype data with a rich
early-transplant data and biosample resource, by defining new mechanisms of relevant lung transplant
syndromes, and by providing a platform for ancillary research applications for a generation of investigators."

 Craniofacial development involves complex signaling to coordinate tissue organization to form the head
and face, and disruptions in this process result in common congenital malformations. A key question in this
field is how external stimuli lead to gene expression changes required to form fully developed craniofacial
structures. Signaling through the Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) plays a critical role in
this process, as mutations in PDGFRΑ are associated with cleft lip/palate in humans. Relatedly, Pdgfra mutant
mouse models develop a range of phenotypes from cleft palate to complete facial clefting. Phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) is the primary effector of PDGFRα signaling during skeletal development in the mouse, leading
to the activation of the kinase Akt. A previous phosphoproteomic screen demonstrated that Akt phosphorylates
the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (Srsf3) downstream of PI3K-mediated
PDGFRα signaling in mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme (MEPM) cells, leading to translocation of
phosphorylated Srsf3 into the nucleus. Srsf3 is ubiquitously expressed with enhanced expression in the neural
crest-derived mesenchyme and overlying ectoderm of mouse facial processes at mid-gestation. Additionally,
ablation of Srsf3 in the murine neural crest cell lineage (cKO) results in a severe midline facial clefting
phenotype due to defects in proliferation and survival of cranial neural crest cells. Further, RNA-sequencing of
Srsf3 cKO facial process mesenchyme identified alternative RNA splicing events that were enriched for
transcripts encoding protein serine/threonine kinases, suggesting that alternative splicing may serve as a novel
feedback mechanism for intracellular kinase signaling. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that
PI3K/Akt-mediated PDGFRα signaling regulates Srsf3 protein and RNA interactions to affect the alternative
RNA splicing of transcripts necessary for craniofacial development. First, Srsf3 will be immunoprecipitated from
MEPM cells in the absence or presence of PDGF-AA ligand and analyzed by mass spectrometry to
comprehensively map phosphorylation changes in response to PDGFRα signaling. Further, craniofacial
phenotypes will be analyzed in a Srsf3 phosphomutant knock-in mouse model to determine the role of Akt-
mediated phosphorylation of Srsf3 in craniofacial development. Next, BioID2 proximity labeling and mass
spectrometry will be used to identify Srsf3 protein interacting partners in response to PDGFRα signaling in
MEPM cells. Finally, Srsf3-RNA interactions will be purified and sequenced in response to PDGFRα signaling
in MEPM cells through enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation analysis to identify direct targets of
Srsf3 and determine if RNA binding and/or sequence specificity changes upon Srsf3 phosphorylation. This
project will determine the molecular mechanisms by which Srsf3 activity is controlled in response to PDGFRa
signaling in the facial mesenchyme, thus providing considerable insight into mechanisms underlying gene
expression regulation during mammalian craniofacial development."

The National Academy of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health have called for urgent
action to improve the care delivered to the nearly 1,000,000 older Americans who die in
intensive care units (ICUs) annually, or survive with substantial impairments. Major problems
include: (1) patients frequently die with distressing symptoms, receiving more invasive, life-
prolonging treatments than they would choose for themselves; (2) family members acting as
surrogate decision makers experience lasting psychological distress from the ICU experience;
and (3) life-prolonging treatments near the end of life contribute to high health care costs. One
potential strategy to address these shortcoming for older patients at high risk of death or
disability is the early integration of specialty palliative care (PC) alongside critical care.
However, there have been no high-quality randomized trials assessing whether integrating
specialty palliative care with standard critical care improves outcomes. We propose to address
this evidence gap by conducting a mixed-methods, multi-center randomized controlled trial
among 625 critically ill older adults with at least one suggested criteria for PC consultation.
Patients and their surrogate decision makers will be randomized to receive either early specialty
PC integrated with standard critical care or usual care, which includes timely clinician-family
meetings consistent with published recommendations. In Aim 1, we will determine effects of
specialty PC integrated with critical care on the co-primary outcomes of patient-centeredness of
care and surrogates’ psychological distress. In Aim 2, we will determine effects of specialty PC
integrated with critical care on three domains of secondary outcomes: patients’ outcomes,
families’ outcomes, and health care utilization. In Aim 3, we will conduct a parallel mixed
methods study to identify contexts and mechanisms that influence the efficacy of specialty PC
integrated with critical care among older critically ill patients. The research is highly significant
because it will determine whether a pragmatic, widely-available intervention is effective against
intractable problems near the end of life for nearly one million older Americans annually. It will
provide important information for healthcare systems and policy makers who are trying to
determine how best to allocate the effort of specialty PC consultants. This proposal is innovative
because it will provide the first high-quality evidence regarding the impact of specialty PC
integrated with critical care. The work is feasible in our hands because our team of established
investigators successfully has a proven record of success conducting multicenter ICU trials and
has buy-in for participation from all sites."

Over the past two decades, the landscape of cancer research has changed with the explosion of publicly
available and investigator generated datasets from evolving technology platforms, and the growing number of
sophisticated computational methods and tools to integrate and analyze them. To move the cancer research
agenda forward, the cancer research community needs a way to easily combine the right tools and methods to
analyze and visualize all the data relevant to their studies, and reproducibly capture the history of what they have
done. These objectives may be especially daunting for cancer biologists who don’t program. The GenePattern
computational genomics environment has served cancer investigators since 2004 and was enhanced by
GenePattern Notebook, released in 2017. The goal of this proposal is to continue to support, expand, and
enhance the GenePattern ecosystem. Through these efforts we will continue to support a diverse community of
users at the forefront of cancer research who seek to better understand the underlying mechanisms of disease,
translate improved methods for patient diagnosis and prognosis to the clinic, and identify new drug targets.
Aim 1. Ensure the GenePattern ecosystem continues to keep pace with new and emerging methods and
technologies and the changing cancer research environment. To increase the range of methods and
approaches available to the GenePattern community, we will provide seamless access to other popular ‘omic
analysis packages (Cytoscape, Galaxy, IGV) within GenePattern Notebook, allowing the interleaving of methods
from multiple packages within the same executable notebook. We will also provide support for querying and
accessing data hosted on selected cancer-relevant data repositories.
Aim 2. Continue to author and serve GenePattern notebooks for the cancer research community. We will
develop 30-50 new high utility notebooks for the GenePattern-Notebook Workspace, leveraging Aim 1 as
required, that provide users with guided, step-by-step execution of their integrative analysis. These will comprise
data processing and analysis workflows, including approaches that bridge the gap from discovery to translation.
Aim 3. Extend, maintain, and support the GenePattern ecosystem infrastructure. We will continue to support
and enhance the GenePattern ecosystem, including enabling hosting on multiple cloud architectures and high-
performance compute sites, and enhancing the Notebook user interface with high-value features.
Aim 4. Provide outreach, training, and support to our user community. We will engage the cancer research
community to continue to address their needs. A Scientific Advisory Board of cancer biologists and physician
scientists will review progress and guide our strategy as we proceed. We will continue our high level of support
and outreach for GenePattern and its notebook environment, including cancer-focused tutorials and training
materials, in-person workshops, conference presentations, webinars, and social media vehicles and our
responsive forum. We will fully participate in all of the ITCR program activities."

Despite advances in treatment and prevention over the past decades, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
imposes substantial burdens in the United States (US). US HIV infections are increasing concentrated in
Southern states with a disproportionate number of rural infections, particularly among racial, ethnic, and sexual
minorities. Rural epidemics in these states are linked to high-intensity urban epidemics, and driven by
racial/ethnic disparities, poverty, inadequate insurance, limited access to healthcare, and housing insecurity.
Additionally, the opioid epidemic disproportionately affects rural communities, increases HIV transmission, and
hinders HIV control efforts.
The Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative seeks to reduce HIV incidence by 90% over a decade. Ending the
US HIV epidemic will require interventions tailored to local-level epidemic dynamics that address underlying
drivers of transmission. Mathematical models of HIV transmission are powerful tool to forecast epidemics, and
can provide evidence-based guidance on the optimal way to prioritize limited public health resources, but these
models have focused primarily on urban epidemics. We have previously developed the Johns Hopkins
Epidemiologic and Economic Model (JHEEM), a platform for modelling local HIV epidemics.
Our objective is to generate projections of local HIV epidemics in states with a high rural burden of HIV to inform
policy decisions by local health departments. We will partner health departments in three states where we have
established relationships (Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi) to develop a suite of transmission models, based
on JHEEM, that rigorously leverage local surveillance data to make projections of the HIV epidemic in each state.
In Aim 1, we will develop an integrated, statewide modeling approach that links rural and urban regions using
mobility data. We will use the models to identify which combinations of HIV testing, pre-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP), and viral suppression – targeted to which demographic subgroups and geographic regions – will yield
the greatest reductions in incidence and disparities. In Aim 2, we will incorporate three social determinants of
health: insurance, access to healthcare, and housing instability, and the racial and ethnic disparities in their
distribution across the population. We will project the impact on HIV incidence and disparities of strategies that
include both traditional HIV interventions and increase insurance, access to care, or stable housing. In Aim 3,
we will expand JHEEM to include the opioid epidemic, and evaluate the potential reductions in HIV incidence
achievable by strategies that combine harm reduction for opioid use disorder with HIV control interventions.
These aims will yield a comprehensive modeling framework that links traditional HIV interventions with underlying
drivers of the epidemic in rural America. Our results will provide data-driven projections, tailored to the specific
needs of states, to inform effective deployment of public health resources in ending the HIV epidemic."

The mucosal epithelial barrier becomes disrupted in many conditions such as surgical procedures, trauma,
inflammatory bowel diseases, ischemia, infections, radiation, and chemotherapy. Epithelial cell regeneration is
essential for mucosal wound closure and healing.
Our overall goal is to understand the mechanisms that lead to effective mucosal wound closure. This proposal
builds on our recent discovery of an intestinal mucosal wound repair mechanism involving CD74 signaling.
CD74 is the receptor for the MIF cytokine.
The proposal aims to address significant questions that remain unanswered in the CD74 signaling pathway
and wound repair, and are worth exploring. Our research is motivated by three key questions based on our
published and preliminary data: What is the mechanism that drives epithelial CD74 receptor expression (Aim

The purpose of this project is to identify mechanisms mediating the differential abuse liability of combusted
cigarettes versus non-combusted tobacco products. Conventional tobacco cigarettes have greater abuse
liability than non-combusted products such as electronic cigarettes (ECs), smokeless tobacco, and nicotine
replacement therapy (NRT). To date, data from animal studies of exposure to extracts of commercial tobacco
products that contain nicotine and a range of non-nicotine tobacco constituents appear to be consistent with
the greater abuse liability of combusted products observed in humans. The mechanisms mediating the greater
abuse liability of combusted products remain unclear, but may reflect the unique or higher levels of addiction-
relevant non-nicotine constituents in cigarette smoke (CS). Some of these constituents (e.g., volatile organic
compounds, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) can mimic or enhance the effects of nicotine, or can exhibit
abuse liability themselves. This project will compare the addiction-related behavioral and neurobiological
effects of CS extract, EC aerosol extract, and nicotine alone (NRT analog). Importantly, CS extract will contain
both water- and non-water-soluble constituents from both the particulate and gas phase of CS, thereby
providing the most comprehensive CS extract ever used in preclinical addiction studies. Levels of a range of
behaviorally relevant non-nicotine constituents in the extracts will be measured to identify specific constituents
that may be responsible for observed differences in abuse liability. Our general hypothesis is that CS extract
will have greater addiction-related behavioral and neurobiological effects than the other formulations due to its
higher levels of behaviorally active non-nicotine constituents. Aim 1 will compare the addiction-related
neurobiological and pharmacokinetic effects of CS extract, EC extract and nicotine alone, including binding
affinity and functional activity at a wide range of addiction-related receptors in vitro, ability to up-regulate
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, produce MAO inhibition, and induce c-fos expression in addiction-related
brain areas ex vivo, ability to elicit dopamine and serotonin release in the nucleus accumbens in vivo, and
nicotine pharmacokinetics. Aim 2 will compare the reinforcement-enhancing and aversive effects of
formulations using intracranial self-stimulation, as well as their effects on ex vivo neural measures under these
dosing conditions. Aim 3 will compare the relative elasticity of demand for (reinforcing efficacy of) formulations
using self-administration methods when each formulation is available in isolation and under novel choice
procedures where each extract is available concurrently with nicotine to examine substitutability. This project
will provide the first direct comparison of both the addiction-related behavioral and neurobiological effects of
different classes of tobacco products, and will significantly advance our understanding of the basic
neurobiological mechanisms underlying the differential abuse liability between them. As such, this work may
inform development of better medications for tobacco addiction by tailoring them to different product classes."

The past decade has seen outstanding advances in the genetics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most of
this progress has occurred by the study of rare genetic variation, especially de novo variation, with the Autism
Sequencing Consortium (ASC) playing a central role. The ASC represents a coordinated international effort to
identify ASD risk genes. In our most recent, unpublished, analyses of 72,410 individuals from ASD families, we
identified 185 genes associated with risk (FDR < 0.05). Some of these genes have been linked to a broad array
of developmental disorders, while others have not. Based on these results, we posit that some risk genes alter
the core features of ASD, while creating fewer perturbations to other features of development: discovery of such
genes will provide deeper insights into pathways disrupted in ASD. We will build on this progress by analysis of
sequence data from three resources: ASD subjects and families; subjects with other developmental and neuro-
psychiatric disorders; and subjects from population samples. We plan new research focusing on interpretation
of rare variation, including single nucleotide variation (SNV), indels, and copy number variation (CNV). Our key
targets are inherited variants, including X-linked inherited variants, which to date have shown very little signal,
and missense variants, for which signal has been confined to highly conserved substitutions. We anticipate
doubling the number of ASD genes discovered, ~ 400, by increasing the number of families analyzed and by
refined methods to interpret inherited and missense variation. And, in parallel, we expect to resolve critical as-
pects of ASD genetic architecture and to unveil key aspects of what makes ASD and its core features – social
deficits and restrictive and repetitive behaviors – different from other neurodevelopmental disorders. To discover
ASD risk genes with a distinct effect on ASD, we have the following specific aims: 1) To amalgamate existing
and emerging whole exome and whole genome sequence data; 2) To develop new analytical methods and
analyze the accumulated sequence data; and, 3) To contrast ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorder risk
genes, examining developmental profiles, cell types implicated, and whether variants in the same gene differ in
how they affect risk for ASD and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. With this new research
we will accelerate our overall objective, which is the identification of ASD genes, thereby facilitating our long-
term goal of building the foundation from which therapeutic targets for ASD emerge. Our rationale is that the
identification of genes conferring significant risk to ASD and associated neurodevelopmental disorders can form
the basis of studies to understand pathogenesis, as well as the basis for novel therapies. Our central hypothesis
– formulated based on results over the past decade – is that rare and common variation contributes additively to
risk for ASD, but only certain rare variants confer substantial risk. The research proposed is innovative, in our
opinion, because it uses groundbreaking and novel statistical methods for identifying risk variants for ASD."

Ischemic stroke, characterized by acute loss of blood flow to the brain caused by thrombus or embolus, accounts
for 80% of all stroke cases and is a leading cause of disability in adults in the U.S. The loss of blood flow creates
a zone of complete infarction (the core) and a surrounding zone of surviving tissue, where much of the limited
repair after stroke occurs (peri-infarct tissue). In this repair, angiogenesis and the formation of new connections
(axonal sprouting) are two key components. The proposed predoctoral NRSA aims to examine innate cellular
responses to a potential stroke therapeutic, a biocompatible hydrogel scaffold with nanoparticle-immobilized
vascular endothelial growth factor, that promotes infiltration of endothelial cells and axons from the surrounding
peri-infarct. I hypothesize that introduction of this hydrogel into a cortical stroke infarct will revascularize the
infarct and promote axonal sprouting and migration of glial cells and neural progenitors into the hydrogel scaffold,
and that neuronal responses, particularly axonal sprouting and synaptogenesis, will be enhanced by
rehabilitation of the affected forelimb in combination with the hydrogel.
I will induce cortical stroke in the mouse forelimb motor cortex and inject the novel multi-component hydrogel
into the stroke cavity. In the studies proposed in Aim 1, I will use 2-photon microscopic live imaging to
longitudinally record and quantify the rate of vessel growth, perfusion, and permeability within the infarct and
peri-infarct. To assess vascular-guided migration, tissue will be analyzed using immunofluorescence images of
cell-type-specific markers, which will enable further studies investigating post-stroke signaling, blood brain
barrier, and glial biology in and without the context of a hydrogel. The second aim of the project is to virally label
axons that have been shown to project into the hydrogel, allowing for identification of the parent neurons and
quantification of the axonal sprouting response to the hydrogel in both the stroke core and peri-infarct. Finally,
to mimic a dual therapeutic approach that would be likely in a clinical setting, a third aim will investigate the effect
of motor rehabilitation on axonal sprouting and connectivity with the recovering tissue stimulated by the hydrogel.
Together, these aims will elucidate fundamental biological mechanisms underlying neural repair after ischemic
stroke, while also establishing a paradigm to assess longitudinal revascularization and virally labeled axonal
sprouting within this novel multi-component hydrogel."

Cardiovascular diseases, including ventricular arrhythmias and heart failure, are an important cause of
morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF), after myocardial infarction (MI) and in the
setting of cardiomyopathy, remain an important cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD). While important sex
differences in the incidence of SCD and VT/VF exist in the setting of ischemic and non-ischemic cardio-
myopathy, the mechanisms behind these sex differences remain unknown. It is established that the autonomic
nervous system plays an important role in the genesis of VT/VF and progression of heart failure. Chronic
sympathetic activation and reduced parasympathetic function increase the risk of VT/VF and SCD.
Pathological autonomic neural remodeling in response to MI alters myocardial responses to catecholamines,
modifies myocardial innervation patterns that exacerbate electrical heterogeneities, and leads to alterations in
sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent and afferent signaling, setting up the substrate for VT/VF and its
dynamic modulation by the autonomic nervous system. Yet, it is unknown if there are sex differences in cardiac
autonomic remodeling that underly the clinical differences observed in the presentation and outcomes of
VT/VF after MI and in ischemic cardiomyopathy in men vs. women, and whether the sex hormone, estrogen, is
a mediator of these differences. In order develop tailored and targeted therapies, it is critical to understand
mechanisms that underly sex differences in sympathetic and parasympathetic dysfunction in the setting of
cardiac disease. In this proposal, we aim to test the novel hypotheses that (1) sex differences exist in
cardiac autonomic remodeling after MI and that these differences underly the occurrence of ventricular
arrhythmias in males vs. females, and (2) estrogen plays a critical role in responses of the autonomic
nervous system to myocardial injury, and hence pathogenesis of ventricular arrhythmias. In specific
aim 1, we will test whether myocardial signaling in response to sympathetic and parasympathetic
neurotransmitters and neuropeptides differ between male and female infarcted mice using optical mapping and
novel FRET imaging techniques of intracellular cyclic AMP signaling. In aim 2, we will test whether sex
differences exist in (i) cardiac innervation patterns (using tissue clearing), (ii) afferent and efferent responses to
optogenetic stimulation of specific autonomic neural pathways, and (iii) autonomic ganglia neuronal changes
and oxidative stress after MI. Aim 3 will evaluate the role of estrogen in improving MI induced myocardial and
autonomic remodeling. Understanding sex differences in these fundamental autonomic and myocardial
pathways has the potential to accelerate development of personalized, novel, sex-based disease-modifying
therapies and tailor available therapies more appropriately by sex, reducing complications and side-effects."
10929417,"An episodic memory is a set of moments recalled together; these moments often share a unique combination
of time, location, and content. Despite our experience with memories as falling into these segmented
categories, it is not well-understood how the brain categorizes moments into episodes. It is theorized that the
hippocampus responds to event boundaries in the environment – specific stimuli, changes in location or time,
that trigger movement into the next represented episode. In humans, room boundaries and task changes are
two candidate event boundaries that seem to separate distinct episodes, demonstrated by decreased memory
performance across these boundaries.1 Despite the importance of episodic memory to our everyday
experiences, the neural mechanisms underlying attention to event boundaries is not well understood due to
resolution limitations of fMRI. Rodents provide a window into these potential neural mechanisms of event
boundaries through large scale in vivo electrophysiology recordings of single neurons and local field potentials
(LFP) in the hippocampus. The hippocampus is known to play a role in episodic memory consolidation and
retrieval, as well as in planning and learning. Planning and episodic memory retrieval appear to have similar
mechanisms displayed through replay of place cell sequences representing the track both in moments
preceding and following a run during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), transient bursts of activity in the 150-250 Hz
LFP band.2 Place cell sequences matching possibilities of the rat's upcoming trajectory also often occur during
theta (5-12Hz) LFP oscillations,3 a phenomenon termed “theta sequences.” Assessing how the brain
represents upcoming runs during theta and SWRs, alongside determining how it replays past runs during
SWRs, together brings us closer to understanding how the brain forms specific episodes. Importantly, reward
locations and environmental changes have been shown to modulate hippocampal place cells and LFPs. We
and others4-5 theorize that these landmarks and content shifts in rodent tasks act in a similar way to event
boundaries in human episodic memory. The proposed study introduces a novel experimental design to test two
candidate event boundaries in the rat, reward locations and task rule transitions paired to separately colored
sides of the maze. Aim 1 will focus on discerning how hippocampal place cells and theta sequences represent
space between pairs of reward locations and at environmental boundary transitions, and specifically how these
representations change upon introduction of new and conflicting reward locations. Aim 2 will focus on awake
SWR replays, also focusing on how segments between reward locations are represented and how these
representations are together integrated with newly introduced reward locations. Completion of this proposed
project will provide important insight into the neural mechanisms underlying episodic memory. This project will
provide rigorous practice in experimental and computational methods and will take place in Kamran Diba's
Neural Circuits and Memory lab as part of the Neuroscience Graduate Program at the University of Michigan."
10826596,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
For patients with end-stage renal disease, dialysis is a life-sustaining therapy unless they receive a kidney
transplant. Over half a million patients receiving dialysis in the U.S. experience multiple ongoing symptoms,
diminished functional status, and frequent emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations, which
negatively affect their quality of life and contribute to a costly burden on the healthcare system. While previous
research in this population has focused on clinical factors (e.g., fluid and electrolyte imbalances) as main
causes of healthcare use, other factors, such as symptom severity and functional status in the context of the
person’s social determinants of health (SDOH) remain understudied. This is a significant gap as most people
on dialysis are from disadvantaged communities (e.g., racial minority and lower socioeconomic status) and are
affected by multiple SDOH simultaneously. For these patients, understanding how social vulnerability of the
community where they live influences the relationships among symptom severity, functional status, and
healthcare use is crucial to improve health outcomes. The proposed secondary analysis using a longitudinal
dataset will examine the relationships among symptom severity, functional status, and healthcare use over
time in patients receiving dialysis and examine the role of social vulnerability as a moderator and/or mediator of
those relationships. The CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) will be used as a collective measure of multiple
SDOH. The original study (R01NR013359: PI Song) recruited from dialysis centers in 7 counties in North
Carolina and examined the trajectories of multidimensional quality of life, including physical, emotional, and
cognitive symptoms and functional status, and collected healthcare use data monthly for 12 months (n=227; 13
data points). Guided by the Behavioral Model of Health Service Use and The Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms,
the proposed study will 1) determine whether symptom severity and functional status influence healthcare use
(measured by ED visits and hospital admissions) in patients receiving dialysis at baseline, 6 months, and 12
months; 2) examine whether symptom severity, functional status, and healthcare use vary by SVI levels of
patients receiving dialysis at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months; and 3) examine whether differences in SVI
influence the relationships among symptom severity, functional status, and healthcare use over time in patients
receiving dialysis using multilevel modeling. This study aligns with the NINR’s priorities to tackle today’s health
challenges by addressing the role of community-level SDOH in the relationships among symptom severity,
functional status, and healthcare use of patients on dialysis. The findings of this study will help identify
individuals whose healthcare use is most affected by symptoms and functional status and inform development
of future screening tools and interventions to support these individuals. With guidance from my mentors, the
proposed training plan will help me develop the necessary skills and expertise to complete the proposed study
and become an independent nurse scientist leading research involving patients on dialysis."

Abstract
Mouse models of human diseases, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), have proven invaluable for
understanding the underlying genetic, molecular and physiological or immunological basis of these disease
processes. Recent work has shown that mouse models that incorporate population-wide genetic diversity can
model unique aspects of the response to Mtb infection, as well as immunization against Mtb, with several of
these strains recapitulating unique aspects of human disease. The mouse genetics core serves this larger
program by identifying/confirming the genetic features driving these unique aspects of host responses to Mtb via
experimental crosses and infection or immunization studies between mouse strains segregating candidate
genome regions, concurrent with genomic and transcriptomic refinement of the candidate variants and pathways.
Lastly, the core will incorporate the results of these analyses to generate improved models of Mtb disease via
the generation of new congenic or mutant mouse strains for the research projects to dissect the impact of these
models and genetically variable pathways on Mtb disease."
10861327,"ABSTRACT: CORE B -- COMPUTATIONAL MODELING & ANALYSIS (Core Leader: Lauffenburger)
A key premise underlying the motivation for this program is that there exist multiple molecular and cellular
features, in both host and pathogen, that operate integratively via complex cross-talks and feedbacks to govern
TB disease outcomes. This premise is distinct from univariate perspectives that seek individual features
predictive of disease state, and from traditional multivariate perspectives that while admitting effects of numerous
features assume that they operate independently. An associated premise is that heterogeneity is crucial to
comprehend in both animal and human studies. These considerations compel computational analysis and
modeling approaches prioritizing incorporation of multiple features, represented by disparate data types, acting
in coordinated manner and exhibiting different quantitative contributions under disparate circumstances and in
diverse subpopulations. The Computational Modeling & Analysis Core (CMAC) will apply a spectrum of state-of-

The major purpose of the Neuropathology Core (NP Core) is to perform diagnostic neuropathologic evaluations
on brains of participants in the Einstein Aging Study (EAS) and to provide research support for the Projects.
The NP Core integrates its activities with the neuropathology service at Montefiore Medical Center, led by Dr.
Steven S. Chin, who oversees the on-call service for harvesting brains in a timely fashion of subjects enrolled
in the EAS. The NP Core uses standardized dissection and processing procedures and collects
neuropathologic data on all brains. Diagnostic reports are provided to key personnel of the EAS as soon as
they are completed by electronic communication. Clinicopathologic correlation analyses are discussed at
annual meetings or through on-line virtual meetings using Zoom. The Specific Aims of the NP Core are as
follows: Aim 1. Perform brain autopsies and prepare tissue for transport from Montefiore Hospital to Mayo
Clinic. Aim 2. Perform diagnostic evaluations using a standardized and systematic approach that has been
used over the life of the EAS, permitting use of the entire autopsy cohort for clinicopathologic correlative
studies and for use in research studies. Aim 3. Enter data from the neuropathology report into an Access
database. Generate a written report for communication with clinicians and family members. Store a digital copy
on Mayo servers, with linkage to the NP Core database that is also linked to tissue inventory, ancillary data
(e.g., genetic data), as well as quantitative pathology and demographics, which permits pooling of Einstein
Aging Study cases with larger clinicopathologic studies. Neuropathologic data are transferred to Biostatistics
and Data Management Core. Aim 4. The NP Core will support exploratory studies in support of Projects, such
as correlations with antemortem biomarkers and assessment of neuroinflammation and pollutants in brain
tissue. The NP Core collects measures of cerebrovascular pathology, including microvascular and white matter
pathology, which can be used to explore pathologic relationships to cardiovascular measures. The NP Core
has tools to assess advanced glycation end products in the brain as a possible correlate of glycemic control.

10857295,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The projected increase in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the coming decades, paired
with the current lack of disease modifying treatments highlights the need to identify modifiable factors that may
prevent or delay ADRD onset. Sleep disturbances, low levels of physical activity (PA) and high levels of
sedentary behavior are common among older adults and each has been identified as a potential target for
prevention of ADRD. Although these health behaviors are interrelated, the majority of studies have only
studied one or at most two at the same time. The independent and joint contributions of these health behaviors
to cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) risk have not been fully examined. Further, many
prior studies have been limited by reliance on subjective assessments of sleep and activity levels and by lack
of longitudinal data. In this renewal of the well-established Einstein Aging Study Program Project (EAS P01;
NIA- AG03949), we will integrate objective ambulatory measures of sleep (wrist actigraphy), physical activity
and sedentary behavior (thigh-worn sensors) with traditional and ambulatory cognitive assessments, robust
cardiometabolic risk profiles, inflammatory measures, psychosocial and demographic factors, and blood based
ADRD biomarkers supported by the EAS P01 Cores and other Projects. Aim 1 will examine the independent
and joint effects of sleep, PA, and sedentary behavior and patterns of these behaviors on daily cognitive
performance, rates of cognitive decline, and MCI incidence. Aim 2 will examine associations of sleep and
activity with measures of cardiovascular risk factors, pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines and cerebrovascular
structure and function and will determine whether these factors mediate associations between sleep, PA and
sedentary behavior with cognitive outcomes. Aim 3 will examine how race, social forces and resilience factors
are related to sleep, PA and sedentary behavior and to cognitive decline. Better understanding the
independent and joint effects of sleep, PA and sedentary behavior and the mechanisms linking them to
cognitive decline prior to dementia onset has the potential to inform targeted behavioral interventions to delay
onset of ADRD. Identifying the associations of race and social forces with these health behaviors and with
cognitive outcomes may elucidate factors which underlie racial differences in rates of ADRD and potential
prevention targets to diminish disparities. Cross linking aims with the other projects will allow us to further
explore mechanisms linking these health behaviors to ADRD risk."
10857297,"ABSTRACT - PROJECT 2
The incidence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are rapidly rising as the world population
is aging. The majority of past research to identify risk factors for dementia has focused on the predictive value of
one factor at a time. This has resulted in a long list of factors that relate to the precursors of ADRD (i.e.,
cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) with little guidance as to which to prioritize or which
targets might be most suitable for intervention. Our approach will address this problem by considering many
factors simultaneously and in interaction. This project will focus on the role of three interrelated factors: major
depressive disorder (and depressive symptomatology), systemic inflammation, and accelerated biological
aging (e.g., DNA methylation age, telomere length). All three are known to be risk factors for MCI and
subsequent ADRD, but the degree to which they have unique impact is unclear, as is the degree to which they
accumulate or interact to confer risk. In addition, this project will help unpack underpinnings of cognitive health
disparities by examining how race and gender moderate connections between depressive symptoms and
biological measures with ADRD, and the relevance of perceived discrimination, lifetime adversity, and
socioeconomic status (SES). Rich assessment at multiple time points in older adults, and determination of
inter-relationships between multiple key risk factors, will enable greater ability to predict not only who is at
greatest risk but also to illuminate specific targets for future intervention.
The proposed project is part of a renewal of the Einstein Aging Study (EAS). For this renewal, 767 racially
diverse men and women aged 60 and older will complete up to 5 annual waves of data collection. Each wave
will include a two week “burst” of daily and ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) to examine
psychosocial and behavioral factors as they are experienced, as well as an in-depth assessment of cognitive
function level, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and depression. A blood draw will occur at the end of each
EMA burst to capture inflammatory load and enable classification of biological age, as well as plasma-based
neurodegenerative biomarkers that will further inform study endpoints.
This project will help clarify the effects of depression, inflammation, and biological age on individual risk for
cognitive decline and MCI, using more nuanced and integrative models than in past research. Innovation
includes leveraging an existing cohort of diverse older adults to explore disparities in ADRD risk attributable to
race, ethnicity, SES, and psychosocial factors (e.g., perceived discrimination), and the use of multiple
biological measures that have not previously been integrated in biopsychosocial models. This work will
ultimately pave the way for tailored interventions to reduce risk of cognitive aging and decline."

Fine particulate matter air pollution has been found to be associated with increased inflammation, respiratory
disease, cardiovascular event risk, and cognitive changes and risk for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementias (ADRD). Prior research has established that those exposed to higher levels of air pollution have
higher levels of accumulated amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau in frontal cortex at autopsy, higher error rates on
cognitive function assessments, and lower scores on memory and both verbal and non-verbal intelligence
assessments. In the US, exposure to high levels of air pollution is common, with substantial heterogeneity that
is often associated with socioeconomic and racial/ethnic differences. Most research on the health effects of air
pollution is based on outdoor ambient air quality measurements often supplemented by monitoring. This
methodology cannot address contributions from indoor air quality and mobility in daily life, has limited
geospatial precision, and cannot address individual differences in exposure and contextual factors (e.g., time
spent indoor vs. outdoor, proximity to pollution sources, smoking, antiquated heating materials, and floor levels
in buildings. This exposure misclassification likely results in significant biases towards the null in the estimation
of the effects of air pollution. Commercially available, validated, wearable air quality sensors can accurately
characterize person-specific air pollutant exposures to better understand how they relate to ADRD, and these
will be used to assess exposure in this project. This Project, part of a renewal of the Einstein Aging Study
(EAS; NIA P01 AG003949), will follow 767 diverse participants aged 60+ (dementia free at baseline) for up to 5
annual waves of data collection, collecting person-specific indices of exposure to fine particulate matter air
pollution (PM1, PM2.5) to investigate the association of fine particulate matter exposure with cognition function
and AD/ADRD (Specific Aim 1), biomarkers of neurodegeneration and vascular brain pathology (Specific Aim
2), and social determinants of health (Specific Aim 3). Establishing the association of person-specific air
pollution exposure with momentary cognitive function, a biological pathway for that association, and how this
association is modified by social determinants will yield insight into individual susceptibility and resilience to
acute and chronic environmental stressors."
10857300,"PROJECT ABSTRACT:
With our aging population and expanding obesity epidemic, the importance of type 2 diabetes
(T2D) as a remediable risk factor for cognitive decline has expanded, particularly in underserved
communities. T2D is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, vascular
dementia, mild cognitive impairment and accelerated cognitive decline. Despite abundant
evidence linking blood glucose (BG) control to cognitive outcomes, research has failed to show
that intensive treatment of diabetes reduces the risk of cognitive decline, perhaps due to
increased exposure to hypoglycemia and BG variability. Neither of these important aspects of
BG control are captured by standard measures. Similarly, prior research is limited by use of
conventional cognitive assessments, which are insensitive to cognitive change. We address
these limitations as part of the renewal of the Einstein Aging Study (EAS; NIA P01 AG003949)
with a new project that innovatively pairs continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology with
smartphone-based, ultra-brief, but highly sensitive ambulatory cognitive tests, developed and
validated in the previous funding period. Through annual 14-day measurement bursts we will
capture the dynamic relationships of BG levels and short-term cognitive variation in real time.
We will be better able to examine how BG regulation predicts cognitive decline over 5 years of
follow-up. The overarching aim of the proposed project is to examine the short- and long-term
effects of various clinically important BG parameters on cognitive performance and decline. The
study will enroll 230 racially and ethnically diverse, and predominantly socioeconomically
disadvantaged older adults age 60+ with T2D, systematically recruited from our Bronx
community. Potential bio-behavioral mediators of short-term effects on cognitive performance
include depression symptoms, negative affect, sleep and fatigue; moderators include age, sex,
race/ethnicity, amyloid, tau, inflammation, and vascular health. Candidate bio-behavioral
mechanisms for effects on long-term cognitive decline associations include depression,
negative affect, sleep, inflammation, elevation of AD biomarkers, and markers of vascular
disease. Moderators include age, sex, race/ethnicity, amyloid, Tau, inflammation, and vascular
health. This research will advance our understanding of the effects of T2D on cognitive
performance and decline in a racially and ethnically diverse at-risk population of older adults.
Ultimately, this work will facilitate the tailoring of glycemic goals and intervention strategies
based on individual patient characteristics."
10855234,"Project Summary
Animals, including humans, navigate through a noisy environment that can damage the ear and elicit whole body
changes in physiology and emotional state. The response to stressors such as noise is important for survival,
for instance by altering gain for improved detection of salient stimuli. However, excessive noise has dire
consequences, such as death of hair cells or neurons and their synapses. It is therefore essential to have a
balanced response to stress that is appropriate for the internal state of the animal. The goal of this project is to
study how neurons outside of the cochlea work together to protect both the cochlea and the animal from
environmental stressors. We hypothesize that stress recruits two parallel sets of efferent inputs to the cochlea:
the lateral olivocochlear neurons (LOCs) and the inner ear sympathetic neurons (IESNs). LOC axons project
from the brainstem to the organ of Corti, where they terminate on a variety of SGN subtypes across many
frequencies. IESNs housed in the stellate ganglion innervate the cochlear vasculature and regulate cochlear
blood flow, consistent with the sympathetic nervous system’s role in the fight-or-flight response. In addition,
IESNs in the superior cervical ganglion extend axons through the osseous spiral lamina, intermingling with
afferent and efferent fibers here and terminating close to the unmyelinated endings of the SGN peripheral
processes. Although a role in stress response has long been proposed, we know very little about the impact of
LOCs and IESNs on cochlear function or resilience, due in large part to the inability to manipulate either
population selectively. In preliminary studies, we characterized the molecular and anatomical properties of LOCs
and showed that they induce neuropeptides in response to noise. In addition, using genetic tools that we
established, we showed that mice lacking LOCs are more vulnerable noise-induced hearing loss than control
littermates, providing compelling evidence for a protective role in the cochlea. In parallel, we showed that IESN
axons contain pre-synaptic puncta that are apposed to afferent and efferent fibers, as well as cochlear
macrophages. Based on these observations and the known importance of neuropeptides for neuroimmune
responses in other systems, we propose that stressful stimuli activate LOCs and IESNs, which cooperate to alter
both auditory circuit activity, via their interactions with each other and the SGNs, and the immune response, with
long-lasting effects on cochlear function. To test this idea, we will use mouse genetics, viral tracing methods,
slice electrophysiology, modern in vivo recording approaches, single cell RNA-sequencing, and in vivo assays
to characterize LOC responses to noise and other stressors, to map the molecular and anatomical properties of
IESNs, and to investigate how LOCs and IESNs impact the immune system and hence cochlear health."

Recent positive results in patients passively immunized with anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies, such as

there is renewed interest in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that can be targeted to
protect the blood-brain barrier (BBB), during therapeutic interventions that target Aβ. We propose to rigorously
investigate the underlying adverse brain blood vessel responses to passive anti-Aβ immunotherapy that result
in ARIAs, and other potentially adverse cerebrovascular responses. We previously published on a symptomatic
case of ARIA-E that participated in clinical trial with bapineuzumab, and we now propose to use the mouse
version of bapineuzumab, monoclonal 3D6 exclusively for passive anti-Ab immunotherapy in 5xFAD Tg mice.
Aim 1: To investigate the temporal sequence and the vascular aging components that contribute to the
adverse CNS blood vessel responses to passive anti-Ab immunotherapy
First, we will investigate the temporal sequence events including BBB dysfunction, myeloid cell activation
and microhemorrhage formation in response to anti-Aβ immunotherapy in 5xFAD mice. Secondly, we will
probe the role of age on vascular dysfunction and impairment of CSF dynamics in response to immunotherapy.
Aim 2: Investigate the role of human APOE4 versus APOE3 in CNS blood vessel responses to passive
anti-Ab immunotherapy causing ARIA-E and ARIA-H and other adverse cerebrovascular responses
We propose to utilize 5xFAD crossed with
APOE3 KI and APOE4 KI to investigate the increased risk for
individuals with ApoE4 genotype to develop BBB dysfunction and cerebral microhemorrhages (ARIA-H) in
response to anti-Aβ immunotherapy.
Aim 3: Investigating the “cellular mechanisms” underlying the CNS blood vessel responses to passive
anti-Ab immunotherapy that result in ARIA-E and ARIA-H and other adverse vascular events
 We will use two approaches to ablate specific effector cell populations in the CNS. In addition, we utilize a
novel method to enhance perivascular macrophage (PVM) function to clear CAA and strengthen the BBB.
Aim 4: Exploration of the “molecular mechanisms” underlying the brain blood vessel responses to
passive anti-Ab immunotherapy that result in ARIA-E and ARIA-H and other adverse vascular events
We plan to explore 3 molecular mechanisms to intervene in BBB responses to passive anti-Ab
immunotherapy by utilizing: Lipoxin A4 an anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution agent ; a selective gelatinase
MMP-2 and MMP-9 inhibitor SB-3CT that crosses the BBB; and a complement cascade inhibitor PMX205, a
C5aR1 inhibitor that blocks the action of C5a, a highly proinflammatory anaphylatoxin."
10849888,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Addiction is a complex pathology of neural circuits that function in reward-processing, impulse control, and
goal-directed behaviors. Small molecules targeting neuromodulator signaling pathways that function in these
circuits are important therapeutics for the treatment of addiction. There is an urgent need to improve the
pharmacology used to treat addiction. To address this need, we have developed methods that uses behavior-
based screens to interrogate a novel source of natural products for effects on neuromodulator signaling in the
nervous system of a microscopic animal - the nematode C. elegans. The natural products that we will screen
are microbial metabolites that have eluded detection because they are not expressed under basal conditions
but can only be elicited by environmental triggers. This microbial 'dark metabolome' contains small molecules
with a wide variety of biological activities. These compounds have not yet been assayed for effects on the
animal nervous system, and they constitute a rich and untapped resource for novel psychopharmacology.
Through screens designed to demonstrate proof-of-concept, we have already identified compounds that
strongly and specifically act on a circuit that uses neuropeptides and serotonin to generate behavior. We have
also designed behavior-based screens for novel modulators of dopamine signaling. In addition to providing the
opportunity to perform high-throughput behavior-based screens, the powerful genetics of the C. elegans model
allows assignment of neuroactive compounds to specific neuromodulator signaling pathways. Successful
completion of the aims of this project will generate enhanced and expanded libraries of novel natural products
never before assayed for effects on the nervous system, identify novel small-molecule regulators of neural
circuits, and match those compounds to specific neuromodulator signaling systems integral to the pathology of
addiction."
10847919,"Abstract
With the “graying of America” we are faced with the need to address the ever-increasing
number of individuals in our society who have age-associated nervous system diseases and
conditions. By the year 2050, there will be up to 16 million Americans with Alzheimer's disease
and an even larger number with additional nervous system-related diseases attributed to aging.
To address this problem, we need multidisciplinary approaches to facilitate the discovery of the
mechanisms, treatments and prevention of these diseases. Active, integrated research-based
training of pre-doctoral students is a key to supplying the research personnel needed to address
these biomedical health care issues. The present application is a competing renewal of a very
successful interdisciplinary program of pre-doctoral training in the neurobiology of aging and
Alzheimer's Disease. This funding cycle we supported 31 full fellows, of whom 12 completed
their training and their Ph.D. The trainees were very productive and published 63 peer-reviewed
papers to date (with almost another full year remaining in this funding cycle of our T32); we also
trained 7 (of 31 = 23%, including the current year of funding) underrepresented students.
Importantly, we maintained our retention/graduation rate at 100%. The continuation of our
strong and successful predoctoral training program is proposed, as our three departments and
our Institute for Translational Research have grown and matured through the addition of faculty
and continued funding especially in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease. Such growth has facilitated
more basic, translational and clinical research into the causes, treatment and prevention of brain
aging and Alzheimer's Disease. Collectively, these new initiatives create a stimulating
environment for the training of predoctoral students. Unique and innovative features of the
training program for the next period of funding include: (1) Development of grant writing skills
through submission of F30/F31 proposals; (2) Continued emphasis on training
underrepresented groups ( 20% participation in the current cycle); (3) our Mentoring-the-Mentor
Program which trains junior faculty in mentoring trainees under the guidance of a senior faculty;
(4) Career counseling and networking development program, (5) Experiential learning with
geriatrics population and translational research skill labs; (6) our institutional support which is
proposed to expand those students who will have access to some or all of this training program;
and (7) our focus on the development of research excellence and leadership among our
trainees. Collectively, these attributes of our Neurobiology of Aging and Alzheimer's Disease
Training Program have produced outstanding trainees and we wish to continue these efforts."
10862385,"SUMMARY - PROJECT 1
The goal of this Center is to understand how gene expression and associated gene function within key neuronal
subtypes regulates the neurobiological substrates required to form cortical circuits that enable decision-making
and behavioral adaptations (i.e., behavioral circuits). Fitting with this theme, Project 1 will investigate the biology
of synaptic GEFs and GAPs at the molecular/biochemical and cellular levels. GEFs and GAPs are complex
multidomain proteins with multiple splice variants. Their protein domains perform enzymatic catalysis, subcellular
targeting, and autoregulation. Such domain combinatorial complexity can further specialize function to various
subcellular compartments, neuronal subtypes, and developmental time-points. Project 1 will test the hypothesis
that a structure-function analyses of isoforms, domains, and clinical variants will reveal mechanisms of
protein regulation that underlie neuronal morphogenesis, synapse formation, and synapse plasticity. We
recently developed novel high- and medium-throughput assays to characterize the modulation of GEF/GAP
catalytic activity and neuronal function by single nucleotide variants and chemical probes. Using these, we
will delineate GEF and GAP spatiotemporal complexity by dissecting the roles of splice variants, enzymatic
domains, and non-catalytic domains at the molecular and cellular levels. Additionally, Project 1 will develop
chemical probes which will be utilized to further define their biological function in Projects 2-4. Spatiotemporal
and GTPase activity analyses will identify critical periods and cell/tissue specificity for biological activity and
genetic and pharmacological manipulation to inform Projects 2–4. Mutation-driven structure-function analysis
will reveal mechanistic insight to guide iPSC and mouse studies in Projects 2–4. Chemical probes will be
highly valuable in Projects 2–4 and for the field. Data generated will reveal novel mechanism of function and
regulation to provide a conceptual framework for the large family of > 180 Ras/Rho GEF/GAPs, with broad
implications."
10852822,"Inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is an important approach to the targeted
treatment of cancer. However, although aberrant EGFR signaling is widespread in cancer, EGFR inhibition is
primarily effective only in a limited number of lung cancers that express specific EGFR mutations and are
oncogene addicted. Thus, the ability to render cancer cells with primary EGFR resistance sensitive to EGFR
inhibition is potentially of enormous clinical value, given the wide prevalence of EGFR overexpressing cancers
with primary resistance to EGFR inhibition. Aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is
common in glioblastoma (GBM). GBM is a devastating disease and, even with the best treatment, the
prognosis is dismal. No targeted treatment is effective in GBM. EGFR gene amplification and mutation are
common in GBM and multiple trials of EGFR inhibition in GBM have been conducted. However, EGFR
inhibition has not been successful in GBM. The failure of targeted treatments in GBM has led to an intensive
effort to understand mechanisms that mediate resistance to targeted treatment. Here, we propose a
mechanism that mediates primary resistance to EGFR inhibition in GBM and a strategy to overcome it. We
propose that the primary resistance of EGFR expressing GBMs results from a rapid adaptive response that
prevents cell death from a sudden loss of EGFR signaling. This adaptive response can be detected in glioma
cells expressing either EGFRwt or the oncogenic EGFRvIII mutant. Our preliminary data indicate that in
glioma cells expressing either EGFRwt or EGFRvIII, Erlotinib triggers a rapid homeostatic response that
involves activation of the transcription factor Nrf2 signaling network. Nrf2 regulates key downstream signaling
networks that are critical mediators of therapeutic resistance to EGFR inhibition in GBM. Our preliminary data
indicate that a combined inhibition of EGFR and Nrf2 overcomes the primary resistance of GBMs to EGFR
inhibition in cell culture as well as in an orthotopic model of GBM. In Specific Aim 1: we examine the effector
mechanisms downstream of Nrf2 that mediate mediating primary resistance to EGFR inhibition in glioma cells
In Specific Aim 2 we examine the mechanisms that regulate activation of Nrf2 in response to EGFR inhibition
in GBM. In Specific Aim 3 we examine the biological effect of combined inhibition of EGFR and Nrf2 or
inhibition of key signaling networks downstream of Nrf2 in a preclinical mouse orthotopic model examining the
hypothesis that interruption of adaptive survival signaling triggered by EGFR inhibition will transform GBMs
with primary resistance into cancers that can be effectively treated by EGFR inhibition. Since both EGFR and
Nrf2 inhibitors are in clinical use, this approach could be rapidly tested in patients. The proposal addresses
critical unmet needs in the management of GBM, and could have a transformative impact on the way GBM is
treated."
10852823,"The overall objective of this proposal is to delineate the mechanism of ZIP4-activated ZEB1-dependent
metastasis in pancreatic cancer (PC). Investigating the functional impact and the underlying mechanism of
this pathway is critical to understand the biology and make inroads on the progression and metastasis of
PC.
PC has the highest mortality rate of any cancer, with a 5-year survival rate below 8%. Despite progress in
improved diagnostic methods and development of targeted therapies, overall survival has not improved
significantly over recent decades. It is imperative to understand the biology of PC, and identify novel
molecular markers and therapeutic targets in PC in order to develop more effective treatments and reduce
drug resistance for this devastating disease. In this proposal, we aim to characterize the molecular
mechanisms underlying the function of a key zinc transporter, ZIP4, and a zinc dependent EMT-like
transcription factor (EMT-TF) ZEB1 in PC metastasis. Our preliminary data demonstrate that ZIP4 promotes
PC growth and metastasis through the modulation of ZEB1. Further studies revealed that this newly
identified ZIP4-ZEB1 axis upregulates integrins, and in turn integrin-mediated cell adhesion, migration and
invasion. We will use these findings as a foundation to further our understanding of the mechanism(s)
underlying ZIP4 oncogenic function in PC. We hypothesize that ZIP4 promotes PC metastasis through a
distinct signaling pathway leading to the activation of an EMT-TF ZEB1, and this pathway represents a
novel therapeutic target for this dismal disease. Three independent but interrelated specific aims are
proposed to address this hypothesis. We will determine the impact of the ZIP4-regulated ZEB1 pathway in
PC cells. We will determine the impact of the ZIP4-regulated ZEB1 pathway in two independent mouse
models of PC (orthotopic xenograft and spontaneous models). We will also delineate the signaling pathway
downstream of ZIP4-activated ZEB1-dependent transcription of integrins in PC.
The ZIP4-activated ZEB1 upregulation represents a novel signaling pathway modulating the growth,
metastasis, and drug resistance of PC tumors. The proposed studies will help define the mechanism
regulating this oncogenic axis and understand the biology of the progression and metastasis of PC. Both
mechanistic and functional studies are proposed using state-of-the-art technologies and genetically
engineered mouse models. The results obtained from this study will be of high impact since they will
significantly advance our understanding on a key zinc transporter and a zinc dependent EMT-TF ZEB1 in
PC metastasis."

Structural racism and discrimination (SRD) have remained a historical legacy of the U.S. from the beginning of
enslavement of African populations in 1619 to the era of apartheid (“Jim Crow”), which ended with the Civil and
Voting Rights Acts. Hidden in plain sight is the biological impact of racial trauma. There is an increasing
awareness that SRD is a salient mechanism perpetuating racial gaps in health among African Americans. In
particular, studies have documented the impact of SRD on negative pregnancy outcomes, including higher rates
of preterm birth among African American (AA) women and higher rates of mortality among Black mothers and
infants. These racial disparities in maternal and infant health are pervasive even after accounting for socio-
economic status and education; and have been shown to persist transgenerationally, possibly via epigenetic
influences. In this study, we seek to investigate the impact of race and transgenerational SRD-related trauma
among AA women on distinct epigenetic modifications at the maternal-fetal interface that are linked to altered
immune cell development, activation, and signaling in the placenta and developing fetus. Studies suggest that
the placenta may be the gateway of maternal transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Mounting evidence
suggests the effects of in utero epigenetic changes go beyond influencing the mother and the child, and are
carried forward through adulthood into germline, to the detriment of successive generations. Perturbed placental
epigenetics is associated with intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, and pre-eclampsia, which are the
drivers of infant mortality among AA. Studies demonstrate race is associated with placental inflammatory
pathology. In addition, high rates of stress due to transgenerational trauma have been associated with chronic
inflammation at the placenta and poor pregnancy outcomes. However, the biological properties that shape
disparities in pregnancy outcomes remain unknown. We hypothesize that SRD-related trauma is transmitted
across generations and manifests with epigenetic inheritance patterns that promote inflammation and innate
immune dysfunction in the placenta and fetus. Three specific aims have been proposed: 1) Evaluate the burden
of SRD on maternal stress, systemic inflammation, and epigenetic signatures among AA pregnant women; 2)
Perform comparative transcriptional, epigenetic, and immunological profiling of placentae from AA and CA
pregnant women to identify specific alterations associated with SRD-related stress; and 3) Investigate in utero
programming of immune responses and the inheritance of specific epigenetic signatures in AA neonates
exposed to maternal SRD-related stress. The biological impact of SRD on epigenetic alterations at the placenta
may contribute to increased vulnerability towards preterm birth and adverse outcomes in infancy and childhood.
These studies may inform future interventions to address such health risks and can promote the health and well-
being of at-risk mother-infant pairs."
10853053,"The current USDHHS guidelines recommend that adults expend at least 1000 kcal per week in PA,12 which
can be obtained through 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity PA, 75 minutes of vigorous intensity PA,
or some combination. However, current estimates suggest that only 3.5% to 43.5% of US adults, and 28% of
overweight or obese adults adhere to these recommendations.13-16 Moreover, people across all World Health
Organization regions become less active as they age.17 A more progressive decline in PA is seen after age 45-
50.15,18 In essence, PA rates tend to decrease as people age and gain weight while the health benefits of PA
become more pronounced. A growing body of research19-36 suggests that a shift in national guidelines to
emphasize PA of a self-selected intensity (i.e., self-paced) instead of prescribed moderate intensity PA may
result in better adherence to PA programs, particularly among overweight and obese midlife adults.37,38 In the
proposed RCT we will conduct a field-based experimental test of the hypothesis that, among overweight and
obese midlife (ages 50-64) adults, adherence to PA programs will be improved when PA is explicitly
recommended to be self-paced rather than prescribed at moderate intensity. This approach represents an
important shift in mindset for those beginning a new program of PA: That is, PA need not be of a certain
intensity in order to “count”. If a self-paced recommendation is found to lead to better PA adherence among
overweight and obese midlife adults, this could have implications for PA recommendations for that population.
Aim 1: We will conduct an RCT comparing the effects of self-paced versus prescribed moderate intensity PA
on PA behavior among low-active overweight and obese midlife (ages 50-64) adults (N=240). Based on
procedures developed in our pilot, all participants will receive a 12-month intervention designed to help them
overcome barriers to regular PA.53 The independent variable will be random assignment to either self-paced or
prescribed moderate intensity PA. The primary outcome will be total volume of PA (frequency x duration x
intensity) as measured by accelerometry at months 3, 6, 9, and 12. H1: A recommendation for self-paced PA
will result in more PA (primary outcome) relative to prescribing moderate intensity PA based on current public
health guidelines.12,54-56 Secondary outcomes include: (a) self-reported min/week of PA over the 12-month
program, (b) fitness changes, and (c) weight changes at months 6 and 12.
Aim 2: Using EMA, we will examine putative mediators of treatment effects based on our conceptual model
(see Figure 1). H2: Self-paced PA will lead to a more positive affective response (primary mediator) and thus
greater increases in PA behavior.37 Secondary mediators (analogous to secondary outcomes) will include: (a)
perceived autonomy, and (b) perceived exertion (RPE).37 Other predictors of PA behavior will also be explored."

Center of the Hugo Moser Research Institute at Kennedy Krieger (KKI) from the current AVANCE
IIIHD generation (installed in 2011 and no longer supported after 2024) to the AVANCE NEO
generation. Multiple parts of the scanner have been failing and will have surpassed their expected
lifetime after 2024. Scanner replacement is necessary to keep providing working and state-of-the-art
equipment to the many investigators at KKI and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), who have 15 NIH-
funded grants and 2 other grants with specific aims that strongly benefit from the technical capabilities
provided by this upgrade. These investigators use the 11.7T system for structural MRI, functional MRI
(fMRI), quantitative physiological MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and spectroscopic
imaging (MRSI), advanced diffusion imaging approaches, and chemical exchange saturation transfer
(CEST) MRI for the study of animal models for a large range of diseases and disabilities.
 The main hardware features of importance for us in the NEO upgrade are the new 8-channel
transceiver system and the high-performance high-duty cycle combined gradient/shim system with 1-
µs gradient waveform generation. In addition, we are requesting several coils, coil accessories, and a
high-end animal monitoring unit for optimal experiments for our users. These combined upgrades will
bring us again to state-of-the-art MRI hardware with respect to commercially available optimal
magnetic field gradient performance and multi-channel whole-body transceive capabilities (both
homonuclear and heteronuclear), including the latest coils and accessories. In addition, our 14-year
old computer would be upgraded and the Paravision 6 software replaced by Paravision 360, which
would provide us with additional advanced data acquisition and processing software, including for
instance: in-plane parallel imaging, simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) imaging with multi-band (MB)
pulses, as well as reduced k-space acquisition approaches such as compressed sensing (CS).
 This upgrade will provide multiple benefits for our users, including but not limited to: reduced
echo time TE and repetition time TR, improved SNR, and greatly increased speed when using in-
plane acceleration, SMS, or CS. Other advantages are reduced spatial distortion, improved B1 and
B0 homogeneities, real time updating for dynamic shimming, drift compensation and motion
monitoring. Improved frequency stability will provide benefits for a) improved signal intensity stability
for dynamic scans; b) absence of spatial image drift under high duty cycle gradient use such as in
high-angular multi-shell diffusion imaging; c) reduced spatial broadening and improved spectral
editing with selective pulse excitation for MRS; d) improved CEST frequency referencing."

Application Project Title: Advancing KNX100 for the treatment of opioid withdrawal: preclinical efficacy and
toxicology, and a phase 1 clinical program.
Project Summary/Abstract
Kinoxis Therapeutics Pty Ltd is an Australian based company that has licensed intellectual property from the
University of Sydney, including several candidates for the treatment of substance use disorders. We have
developed a novel small molecule lead, KNX100, which is showing considerable promise in preclinical animal
models of a range of substance use disorders, including models of OUD, with particularly impressive efficacy
at reducing the severity of opioid withdrawal symptoms in mice. KNX100 was discovered from a phenotypic
screen of compounds derived from a fragment-based drug discovery program targeting the brain oxytocin
system. KNX100 has a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile in testing thus far. To date, KNX100 has
undergone testing for efficacy signals in two rodent and two non-human primate species, with testing taking
place across multiple laboratories including National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) commissioned
laboratories under the NIDA Medications Development Program.
The proposed activity under this funding opportunity is to progress the development of KNX100 in opioid use
disorder, with the specific indication being treatment of opioid withdrawal. The overall objective of the project
is to establish the safety and tolerability of KNX100 to enable human efficacy testing to commence in patients
requiring treatment for opioid withdrawal. The long-term objective for this development program is to generate
human efficacy data to support KNX100 as a potential treatment for opioid withdrawal symptoms and
ultimately enable a New Drug Application to the FDA.
The company has developed a research plan which entails both a UG3 Phase and a UH3 Phase. For the UG3
Phase, the company plans to complete all the necessary IND enabling studies required for FDA approval to
administer KNX100 in a first in man, Phase 1 clinical study. The program includes additional testing of KNX100
in animal models of opioid withdrawal; scale up and manufacture of drug substance and drug product to
support both the non-clinical and clinical programs; a toxicology program to generate data to support the Phase
1 study; and the submission of an Investigational New Drug Application to the FDA.
Following the successful completion of the UG3 Phase, measured by the milestone of FDA Clearance of an IND
Application to a Commence a Phase 1 Study without a clinical hold, the company would then progress into the
UH3 Phase by completing a Phase 1 clinical program to establish the safety and tolerability of KNX100 when
dosed in humans.
The purpose of this NIH/NIDA Funding Opportunity Announcement (RFA-DA-19-002), for which this
application is being submitted, is to support the discovery and development of medications to prevent and treat
opioid use disorders (OUD) and overdose. The development of KNX100 offers an opportunity to provide a
more efficacious and/or safer alternative to the current only approved medication for opioid withdrawal,
lofexidine, and this application will accelerate the development toward this objective."

Dementia causes substantial burdens for patients and caregivers, which have been exacerbated by the COVID-
19 pandemic. The current state of dementia care is inadequate to meet the needs of this growing, vulnerable
population. Scalable, effective, and person-centered dementia care models that are aligned with value-based
healthcare reforms are needed now. The Care Ecosystem is an accessible, remotely delivered team-based
dementia care model, designed to add value for patients, providers and payers in complex organizational and
reimbursement structures. Care is delivered via the phone and web by unlicensed Care Team Navigators, who
are trained and supervised by a team of dementia specialists with nursing, social work, and pharmacy expertise.
Care Protocols guide proactive, quality care that is documented in the electronic health record. The evidence
base to date suggests that the Care Ecosystem improves outcomes important to people with dementia,
caregivers, and payers when delivered in a controlled research environment, including reduced emergency
department visits, higher quality of life for patients and lower caregiver depression. We propose a rapid pragmatic
trial in 6 health systems serving geographically and culturally diverse populations. We will leverage technology,
delivering care via the phone and web and using electronic health records to monitor quality improvements and
evaluate outcomes while maximizing external validity. In Aim 1, we will use implementation science to identify
the model adaptations, facilitators, and barriers to implementing and sustaining the Care Ecosystem during the
COVID-19 pandemic. In Aim 2 we will use mixed methods to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the Care
Ecosystem on outcomes important to patients, caregivers, healthcare providers, and health systems during the
pandemic. In Aim 3, we will characterize the patient and caregiver factors associated with treatment benefit.
This will include investigating effectiveness in underrepresented groups and elucidating unmet needs that will
guide future development work. By simultaneously evaluating the real-world effectiveness and implementation
strategies in diverse health systems, this project will bridge the science-practice gap in dementia care during an
unprecedented time of heightened strain on family caregivers, healthcare providers and health systems.
Furthermore, this work will pave the way for expanding access to high quality dementia care in the future,
mitigating the negative impact of dementia on patients and their families across the nation."
10857164,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common inherited retinal dystrophy (IRD), caused by more than 3,100
mutations in 80 genes that are primarily specific to rod photoreceptors. Following major rod death phase, cone
death occurs regardless of the underlying gene mutations. Currently, there exists a knowledge gap in
understanding how aerobic glycolysis in photoreceptors impact the delicate “metabolic coupling” between rods
and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in RP. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a therapy that
will preserve cone function in patients with RP. The objectives of this proposal are to investigate how metabolic
dysregulation due to lactate deficiency contributes to photoreceptor death in RP, test a novel metabolome
reprogramming strategy, and fulfill important safety requirements for filing a Pre-Investigational New Drug
application. The hypothesis is that reprogramming rod and cone aerobic glycolysis will promote cone survival in
RP independent of the underlying rod-specific gene mutations. This hypothesis has been formulated based on
the applicant’s strong preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed research is that by targeting a metabolic
pathway common to many of the genetically heterogeneous forms of RP, cone function may be preserved for
the equivalent of 10 or more human years, which would have a tremendously positive impact on the lives of
patients with RP. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Investigate whether
photoreceptor-specific ablation of prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein (Phd), a metabolic enzyme that
inhibits aerobic glycolysis under normoxia, preserves cones by enhancing aerobic glycolysis in an autosomal
recessive RP mouse model; 2) Assess the efficacy and feasibility of enhancing cone survival and function by
ablating PHD2 in photoreceptors of a dominant RP mouse model ; 3) Establish the safety of therapeutic Phd2
editing in a WT and RP mouse model as well as human cells. Specifically, Aim 1 will determine whether
enhanced aerobic glycolysis in cone photoreceptors can promote their survival in a novel genetic mouse model.
Aim 2 will test the potential of gene therapy to slow photoreceptor degeneration by enhancing aerobic glycolysis
in a different mouse model of RP. Lastly, Aim 3 will define the pharmacokinetics and safety of the aerobic
glycolysis reprogramming vector. The approach is innovative because this will be the first example of cell-specific
CRISPR-mediated precision metabolic reprogramming and because the novel therapeutic-editing vectors can
be redeployed in future Phase I-IIA trials without modification. The proposed research is significant as it has the
potential to dramatically lower the cost of treatment, be applicable to dividing and nondividing cells, shape
ongoing CRISPR research, and ultimately define aerobic glycolysis as a safe and effective therapeutic target."
10857165,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects 25% of the US adult population and is associated with
obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, approximately 20% of NAFLD patients
(13-16 million people) develop liver fibrosis, which is associated with a higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma,
cirrhosis and liver failure. Unfortunately, there are few effective treatments for NAFLD, aside from lifestyle
modification and liver transplant. Excess neutral lipids are stored in lipid droplets (LDs)–dynamic organelles
that quickly expand and shrink depending on the metabolic needs of the cell. Importantly, LD morphology and
abundance are determined by the fusion or lipolysis of existing LDs. Recent studies have led to the discovery
of a novel protein named BASIC, an endoplasmic reticulum-lipid droplet protein that promotes a multilocular
phenotype and increases lipid utilization in brown adipocytes. BASIC is expressed in white and brown adipose
tissue, and liver. In adipocytes, BASIC inhibits LD fusion proteins CIDEA and CIDEC, preventing expansion of
LD size. CIDEB, the primary CIDE protein expressed in liver, has been shown to promote VLDL secretion,
decrease triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis, and inhibit b-oxidation in hepatocytes. However, the
physiologic or pathologic contexts in which the liver requires small, BASIC+ LDs for optimal function remain to
be determined. Interestingly, global, but not adipose-specific deletion of BASIC decreases fat mass in chow-
fed mice, pointing to adipose-independent effects on systemic energy balance. Preliminary data indicate that
BASIC is a PPARa target gene whose expression is highly induced by both fasting and western diet feeding.
Acute overexpression of BASIC decreases plasma lipids, suggesting this protein regulates hepatic lipid
metabolism. The proposed research plan will elucidate the hepatic mechanism of action by characterizing how
BASIC regulates LD biology and define molecular interaction partners in vitro (Aim 1a). Furthermore, the
pathway(s) affected by hepatic BASIC expression (beta-oxidation, lipogenesis, lipoprotein secretion) will be
determined (Aim 1b). In vivo studies using gain- and loss-of-function approaches in mice will characterize the
role of BASIC in fasting and in response to high-fat diet feeding (Aim 2). Completion of the proposed aims will
provide insight for the function of a novel PPARa target gene, which will contribute to the growing
understanding of hepatic lipid droplet biology and may reveal novel opportunities for therapeutics in
dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis."
10857166,"Synthesis of partially saturated nitrogen heterocycles through stereo- and regioselective
 dearomatization of heteroarenes.
 Nitrogen-containing heterocycles are important in multiple areas of chemistry including
pharmaceutical, agrochemical and materials science due to their chemical properties and
biological significance. These heterocycles are often grouped as aromatic and non-aromatic
heterocycles. Aromatic heterocycles are widely available and recent advances in various cross
coupling and C-H activation chemistry have further improved the access to these heterocycles.
On the other hand, methods for the synthesis of non-aromatic heterocycles which often contain
stereogenic centers at sp3 hybridized carbon centers are less developed.
 Our long-term goal is to develop new chemical transformations that will regio-, and
stereoselectively introduce functionality into the heteroarenes to enable synthesis of partially
saturated nitrogen heterocycles. Partially saturated heterocycles are excellent precursors to both
aromatic and non-aromatic azaheterocycles. For example, dihydropyridines can be
functionalization or reduced to yield tetrahydropyridines and piperidines and they can be oxidized
to yield pyridines.
 The current proposal addresses the regioselective, stereoselective and catalytic addition
of nucleophiles and electrophiles to the heteroarenes for the synthesis of partially saturated six-
membered azaheterocycles. Specifically, we propose methodologies supported by significant
preliminary results and literature precedents for the transition metal catalyzed dearomatization
reactions of heteroarenes focusing on the regioselective dearomatization of six-membered
heteroarenes containing one or two nitrogen atoms. Dearomatization approaches proposed by
us include Rh, Pd, Ni and Cu catalyzed addition of boron nucleophiles as well as addition of
organometallic nucleophiles to activated N-alkyl and N-acyl heteroarenes. In addition to coupling
of nucleophiles, we propose dearomative coupling of heteroarenium salts with electrophiles using
Ni-photoredox system. Catalyst design approaches for controlling the regio- and stereoselectivity
of the addition reactions will also be explored.
 Methods described by us are innovative as they involve previously unexplored
approaches, coupling partners and catalysts. The results obtained from these studies will be
significant as the saturated and partially saturated heterocycles are common structural motifs in
bioactive natural products and pharmaceuticals."

deaths worldwide. Rb tumors arise from biallelic loss of the RB1 gene during retinal development in-utero, and
are uniformly lethal if left untreated. While clinical management of the tumor has advanced in recent decades,
the non-specific and highly toxic nature of current therapies frequently result in life-long visual compromise and
health complications. Similarly, the exorbitant cost and limited access to advanced procedures render the best
treatment options inaccessible to most children worldwide, where eye removal remains the only life-saving option
for patients. However, the social stigma and psychological effects of eye removal often lead parents to forego
treatment, resulting in survival rates below 50% in many regions of the world. The most significant barrier to
progress in developing targeted selective therapies for retinoblastoma is the gap in knowledge regarding the
molecular drivers of retinoblastoma progression. Currently, no laboratory models exist, animal or otherwise,
which faithfully recapitulate the human manifestation of this disease, and the limited amount of information
available comes from tumors which necessitate removal, thus only providing a snapshot of the molecular
mechanisms present in advanced cases. The ability to study these tumors in earlier stages, including their pre-
malignant phase would shed light into the molecular drivers of Rb progression, lead to more targeted therapies
which obviate the need for eye removal, ideally preserving vision but, more importantly, save lives. Recently, we
have developed a human iPSC-based 3-Dimensional retinal organoid differentiation protocol and tissue culture
bioreactor system in which we can control various environmental parameters critical for proper retinal
development. Using this platform, we can use gene editing to introduce the most prevalent mutations found in
Rb tumors and evaluate their effect on retinal development and tumor formation. We have shown how some of
these mutations lead to amplification of a pre-malignant undifferentiated mutant cell clone, and disrupt terminal
differentiation of other retinal cell types. We now propose to establish this platform as the first model system in
which the various aspects of human Rb tumors can be elucidated, from their initiation through the drivers of
malignant transformation. In order to achieve this, we aim to 1) Optimize, validate, and deploy our tissue
bioreactor system to recapitulate the microenvironment of the developing retina, 2) use gene editing technology
to establish the physiologic pattern of mutation acquisition during retinogenesis which leads to Rb tumor
formation, and 3) use our 3D retinal organoid platform to screen pharmacological compounds that can address
the molecular determinants of Rb tumor progression."
10857288,"ABSTRACT
Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are a heterogenous group of orphan diseases, inherited in an autosomal
dominant, recessive or X-linked pattern in addition to mitochondrial transmission, all leading to the loss of
functional vision and often progressing to blindness. As a group, IRDs are due to mutations in over 280 genes.
Currently, there is only one FDA approved gene therapy for this large family of retinal degenerations. Prime
editing, a new versatile genome editing tool, allows for all 12 base-to-base changes, insertions up to 44 bases
long and deletions of up to 80 bases. Prime editors are capable of correcting 89% of known genetic variants
associated with human disease, but are still in their infancy for in-vivo use. Our long-term goal is to optimize
prime editing platforms for IRDs. Lipid based nanoparticles (LNPs) are a modular platform that can
encapsulate and deliver genome editors. Delivering nucleases as mRNA has been an optimal alternative
strategy for transient protein expression rather than persistent expression of DNA cutting machinery associated
with viral vectors. LNPs are capable of rapid and efficient delivery of mRNA to the retinal pigment epithelium,
however, they have limited capacity to transfect photoreceptors, which is necessary to target the many genes
associated with IRDs. We hypothesize that by employing phage display techniques, we will isolate promising
targeting peptides which will decorate our LNPs and effectively deliver prime editing cargo to the
photoreceptors. Our main goal is to generate peptide-targeted LNPs that lead to cell-specific delivery of prime
editing components for the treatment of IRDs. To achieve this goal, we propose the following specific aims: 1)
Optimize in-vivo phage display biopanning for the identification of targeting peptide moieties that allow for
photoreceptor-specific lipid nanoparticle-based gene delivery, 2) Dissect the mechanism of peptide-targeted
LNP entry into photoreceptors, and 3) Evaluate the efficacy, and any associated toxicity, of prime editing in two
rodent models of IRD. Thus far, we have identified novel peptides that can steer LNPs toward photoreceptor
gene delivery and determined that LNPs can package all prime editing components together and lead to
efficient prime editing of reporter genes in-vitro and in-vivo. Successful completion of this project will lead to the
development of cell-specific gene editing platforms that will advance treatment for IRDs."
10831844,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our lungs are continually exposed to bacteria, viruses, and toxic particles, often complicating common
pulmonary disorders such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF).
To protect the lungs from these challenges, mammals have evolved multiple innate airway defenses that
include mucus production, antimicrobial factor secretion, and mucociliary transport (MCT). Both airway
submucosal glands (SMG) and surface epithelia contribute to this first line of lung defense. However, the
relative importance of their contributions or the interplay between these contributions is not well understood.
Furthermore, these defenses depend on maintaining optimal pH and airway surface liquid (ASL) volume.
Based on the abundance of SMG and their products, it has been hypothesized that SMG play a critical role in
host defense. But that hypothesis has gone untested. We also do not know whether SMG serve host defense
under basal conditions or only when they are stimulated to secrete by an airway challenge. Before we can
develop novel therapeutic approaches for devastating lung diseases, we must: a) determine the contribution of
airway surface epithelia and SMG to airway host defense and b) understand how pH and ASL volume regulate
MCT and antimicrobial activity. In this proposal, we focus on the interplay of SMG and surface epithelia. We
study pigs because they have airways and SMG like those in humans. We disrupted a gene (EDA) necessary
for SMG development. Newborn EDA-KO pigs lack airway SMG, have disrupted MCT, and impaired bacterial
killing. Because EDA-KO pigs lack SMG, they provide the exciting opportunity to test our overarching
hypothesis that SMG are required for normal airway host defense and that their loss will lead to airway
disease. We will test our hypothesis by investigating the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. What is the role of
submucosal glands in ASL pH and volume regulation in the airway? Aim 2. How do submucosal glands
contribute to large and small airway mucociliary transport? Aim 3. Does decreased antimicrobial peptide-
mediated bacterial killing, due to lack of SMG, cause lung disease? Comparing pigs with and without SMG will
provide the first direct evidence about whether and how SMG are required for respiratory host defense. The
results will also lay a critical foundation for future tests of how SMG contribute to airway disease
pathophysiology. Finally, increased scientific knowledge of SMG and interactions between surface
epithelia/SMG will provide a better foundation for understanding how ASL is regulated, how MCT is controlled,
and ultimately identify desperately needed new targets for lung diseases."

 The mission of the Administrative Core is to provide the overall management, direction and supervision of
ES-DRC activities. This includes the financial, personnel, research and enrichment activities of the ES-DRC.
The Administrative Core’s primary objectives are to maintain efficient and seamless integration of Center
activities both within and external to Einstein, thereby coordinating our efforts with the administrative staff at
Mount Sinai and other affiliated institution members in the New York area. By reducing administrative burdens
placed on ES-DRC faculty, this allows investigators the greatest potential for success in their research efforts.
In addition, the Administrative Core provides the management for all finances and personnel that are
associated with the ES-DRC and is central to the organization and management of the Enrichment Program.
The Administrative Core is specifically responsible for allocation and oversight of ES-DRC resources in
coordination with policies and procedures defined by the Executive Committee and input from the External
Science Advisory Committee. This includes the implementation of Core review, review of membership,
organization of the research base, functional management of the Enrichment and Pilot & Feasibility Study
Program, and maintenance of the ES-DRC website. The Administrative Core is also responsible for the
development and organization of initiatives such as the institutionally supported Microgrant and Catalytic Seed
Grant programs and interfacing with Mount Sinai and other regional institutions in management of budgetary
(direct and indirect), material transfers, animal and human studies approvals and compliance with all university
policies and procedures. In these efforts, Dr. Jeffrey Pessin serves as the ES-DRC Director and will oversee all
ES-DRC activities and is assisted by the Associate Directors, Drs. Andrew Stewart and Meredith Hawkins, the
ES-DRC Executive Committee and the Core Facilities Management Committee. Together these individuals
ensure the seamless coordination of all ES-DRC activities with other Institutional centers and facilities and
other initiatives to enhance the mission of the ES-DRC. The Administrative Core proactively integrates the ES-
DRC with the efforts of other DRC’s in the Northeast and provides a mechanism for the inclusion of
investigators from other institutions as full participatory center members."
10832985,"The Animal Physiology Core (APC) employs sophisticated research methodologies to assist Einstein-Mount 
Sinai Diabetes Research Center (ES-DRC) investigators in the in vivo assessment of glucose and fatty acid 
metabolism, insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis in mice and rats. Through collaborative efforts with the 
other Cores of the ES-DRC, the APC enables investigators to thoroughly characterize the effects of defined 
pharmacologic, dietary, environmental and genetic alterations on glucose and lipid homeostasis, insulin action, 
and metabolism. To accomplish these goals, the Animal Physiology Core will: 1) Offer advice and instruction to 
students, postdoctoral fellows, investigators and technical staff in the design and performance of physiologic 
approaches and techniques necessary to evaluate the control of glucose homeostasis and insulin action in 
rodents, 2) Make available to investigators specialized measurements of whole body and tissue-specific glucose 
metabolism and insulin action in rodent models including insulin, pancreatic and hyperglycemic clamps and 
spontaneous glucose monitoring, 3) Provide specialized gastrointestinal, neurosurgical and histological models 
for the study of insulin sensitivity, energy balance, and glucose and fatty acid metabolism, including gastric 
bypass and adipose and hepatic tissue denervation, imaging and photo-stimulation, 4) Provide analysis of whole

glucose utilization by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and microPET scanning, 8) Assist 
investigators in the interpretation of data and to design further experimental approaches to reveal the molecular 
and physiological bases of metabolically relevant rodent phenotypes, and 9) Facilitate and integrate the 
functional assessments provided by the APC with assays provided by other ES-DRC Biomedical Cores. All these 
services are available to investigators new to diabetes research, as well as to investigators working on diabetes- 
related projects that can be enriched and extended by the use of the expertise and facilities of this Core."
10832986,"The goal of the Stable Isotope and Metabolomics Core (SIMC) is to provide to Einstein-Mount
Sinai Diabetes Research Center research investigators cost effective, efficient and robust
platforms for the determination of metabolites/lipids designed to cover interlocking metabolite
and lipid pathways, and help to improve our understanding of conditions which change fuel
utilization and biosynthesis in cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolic pathways, i.e., glycolysis,
pentose and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycles. To accomplish these goals in one facility, the SIMC
has updated its technology infrastructure to include the latest Seahorse XFe24 and XFe96
Seahorse Flux Analyzers for assessment of glycolytic and mitochondrial energetics in real time,
the latest Sciex 6500+ QTRAP with Selexion ion mobility for targeted LC/MS.MS metabolite and
lipidomic analyses, and is due to replace its Orbitrap/LTQ high mass accuracy instrument with
the latest Shimadzu LC-9030 quadrupole Time of Flight with Nexera UPLC for untargeted
metabolomic and lipidomic analyses. These latest additions add to the high mass resolution
Waters GC-TOF/MS and two unit Dalton resolution Agilent single quadrupole GC/MS machines
to accomplish the following aims:
1. To determine metabolomic/lipidomic profiles for the diagnosis/characterization of
 physiological and pathophysiological states in cells, tissues and biofluids (plasma, urine,
 stool, etc.).
2. To perform in vivo stable isotope substrate assays to determine rates of protein synthesis,
 lipogenesis, peripheral glucose disposal, hepatic glucose recycling, glucose-glycerol cycling
 and Cori cycling, high energy phosphate (ATP, creatine phosphate) turnover, and in vitro
 stable isotope flux dissections of metabolic pathways.
3. To perform assessments of glycolysis (extracellular acidification rates, glycolytic ATP
 production rates) and mitochondrial oxygen consumption (mitochondrial respiration and
 mitochondrial ATP production rates) in tissue explants, primary isolated and tissue culture
 cells using Seahorse Biosciences Flux Analyzers.
4. To advise and instruct ES-DRC investigators and their students, fellows and technical staff
 in the design and interpretation of fluxomics, metabolomics/lipidomics and computational
 analyses with the aim of elucidating the molecular basis underlying glucose and lipid
 homeostasis in humans and animal models."
10832989,"Diabetes affects some 30 million people in the US. Both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes ultimately result from failure
of beta cell mass and/or function. Human islets and beta cells are similar to their rodent counterparts in many
ways, but also differ in important ways. Accordingly, the NIDDK, ADA and JDRF are increasing their focus on
research in human beta cell and islet biology. Indeed, research focused on human islets is essential for
translating important insights from rodent islets and beta cells into significant advances in human diabetes
research and treatment. The Human Islet and Adenovirus Core (HIAC), located at Mount Sinai, was created
five years ago to support the research base of the Einstein-Sinai Diabetes Research Center (ES-DRC), as well
as regional investigators pursuing islet biology, by providing special emphasis on human islets. During the
previous funding cycle, the HIAC provided expertise and services to 50 investigators supporting 41 publications
and 22 federally and non-federally funded grants. Consequently, we propose to expand these sought-after
services and to further enhance access and availability of islet-relevant education, services and technology to
diabetes researchers in the New York City region. The first mission is to provide key advice, methods,
technology and infrastructure to assist investigators in the use of human islets for research, with the goal of
furthering understanding of normal and pathophysiologic islet cell growth and function. The second mission is
to generate, and make available to the ES-DRC community, reagents and tools including adenovirus or lentivirus
viral vectors for gene delivery of cDNAs and shRNAs of interest beta cells and other islet cell types to study beta
cell regeneration, differentiation, survival and function. These missions will be achieved by developing the
following Specific Aims: 1) To assist new islet investigators in obtaining in accessing human and rodent islets
and related cell lines for use in investigator-driven studies; 2) To train students, postdoctoral fellows, investigators
and technical staff in the design and use of molecular, cellular and physiologic approaches to human and rodent
islet biology and pathophysiology; 3) To provide pure populations of live human beta cells using fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) and/or to facilitate the use of specialized protocols, adenovirus/lentivirus and
transduction methods for gene delivery to rodent and human beta cells and islets that enhance investigator-
initiated research; 4) To conduct specialized assays for the determination of insulin secretion, islet bioenergetics
and beta cell differentiation, proliferation, survival and mass in vitro and in vivo using syngeneic, allotransplant
or xenotransplant of rodent/human islets into immunocompromised euglycemic or diabetic mouse models; and
5) To assist investigators with study design and data interpretation to advance experimental approaches focused
on the molecular and physiologic basis of human islet cell function and dysfunction in Types 1 and 2 diabetes."
10832991,"Over the past decade, a succession of remarkable technological advances has reconfigured the landscape of
biomedical research using “immuno-technologies”, the broad collection of methodologies pertaining to the
quantification, correlation and visualization of analytical modalities in the study of the immune system. Despite
their extraordinary promise, however, implementation of these technologies by academic researchers includes
significant obstacles, chiefly the need for ready access to appropriate technological infrastructure and the
considerable cost associated with assay performance. To address these challenges, the new Immuno-
Technology Core (ITC) has been conceived as an education, coordination and service core that will provide a
paradigm for inter-institutional cooperation and will be the focus of directed recruitment and expansion of
our diabetes immunology research base. Specifically, the ITC will focus its activities on distinct technology
platforms that have been prioritized in discussion with multiple Einstein-Mount Sinai Diabetes Research Center
(ES-DRC) investigators, based on the evolving research needs of our research base. Access to respective
services is distributed across both Einstein and Mount Sinai; the ITC will harness the combined technology
infrastructure for the following objectives:
1. To raise awareness about select state-of-the-art technology infrastructure available at Einstein and Mount
 Sinai (cellular, imaging, and immunomodulation platforms); to provide consultation and advice about the
 potential and limitations of respective technologies; to assist investigators with experimental planning,
 design and considerations about expected financial investments; and to facilitate interactions with
 managers, application scientists and data analysis specialists working with each technology platform.
2. To provide support services required for the effective and efficient implementation of tailored experimental
 protocols. Accordingly, the ITC will focus on specific reagent selection, testing and validation; protocol
 adjustment and optimization; and integration with established assay workflows.
3. To facilitate access and provide practical support for the usage of selected technology platforms: a)
 cellular – mass cytometry / Cytometry by Time-of-Flight (CyTOF); b) imaging – multiplexed
 immunohistochemistry and whole-slide imaging as well as biophotonic in vivo imaging; and c)
 immunomodulation – synTac technology developed at Einstein for antigen-specific T cell modulation.
Collectively, ITC services and expertise will support and advance the work of ES-DRC investigators by
catalyzing the integration of cutting-edge, complex and otherwise often cost-prohibitive technologies into
their research programs. Conceived as a novel and unique resource for the study of both islet biology and
the immunological aspects of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and obesity, the ITC will both support existing
ES-DRC efforts and serve as a recruiting tool for new investigators in these areas."
10832993,"TRC abstract
The primary mission of the Translational Research Core (TRC) is to promote high-quality diabetes
translational research, through delivery of services including consultation, technical support, and
training and mentoring in clinical research methods that are specifically applicable to diabetes, its
complications and related metabolic disorders. Core services derive from the broad expertise of Core
investigators, encompassing first-in-human and mechanistic studies in integrative physiology, and
clinical trials involving diabetes and obesity and application of emerging technology, thus spanning a
wide spectrum of translational research. The TRC is strategically focused on clinical physiology and
metabolism and diabetes therapeutics (“T1-T2” research), while maintaining a relationship to the
continuum of translational research at Einstein and its regional partners. The unique strengths of the
TRC in the next project period will position us to promote the continued growth of diabetes-related
translational research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Einstein) and to further integrate
diabetes investigators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, as well as other regional
partners. Thus, the two key features of the TRC in this renewal are 1) the renewed focus on
early stage translational research (“T1-T2”) and 2) expansion of the Einstein-Mount Sinai DRC
partnership. The TRC provides resources for diabetes research via faculty expertise and
consultation and collaborations with other programs and projects, as well as access to trained TRC
personnel to assist with crucial aspects of human research protocol implementation. In addition, the
TRC leverages resources of the recently renewed Einstein-Montefiore Clinical and Translational
Science Award (CTSA, known as the Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, ICTR) and the
Mount Sinai CTSA’s Institutes for Translational Sciences (“Conduits”), which are key partners in our
efforts to facilitate and promote translational research in diabetes. Both CTSAs provide research
infrastructure and facilitate access to other institutionally sponsored services, while the TRC
specifically focuses on support of the unique needs of investigators in diabetes, obesity and
metabolism and provides direct services beyond the scope of CTSAs. The TRC is designed to
fill critical gaps in the resources needed to promote the broad range of diabetes clinical and
translational research by fulfilling the following Specific Aims: 1) To provide consultation on the
design and implementation of human subjects research in the areas of diabetes, obesity and
metabolism; 2) To provide specialized technical services for clinical investigation in diabetes,
obesity and metabolism; and 3) To provide expertise and training in diabetes-specific
research methodology."
10832995,"The mission of the Pilot & Feasibility Study Program is to provide initial support for new
investigators, established investigators to explore new directions, and to enable the ES-DRC to
attract scientists from other disciplines to diabetes research. The Pilot and Feasibility (P&F)
Study Program is a vital component of the ES-DRC and has successfully promoted numerous
new research endeavors in diabetes-related areas. This program constitutes a key interface
among the Einstein, Mount Sinai and academic communities at large, and serves as a major
attraction in the recruitment of faculty and staff. From 2010 to 2018, the ES-DRC funded 22
feasibility studies from a pool of 98 applications (funding rate of 22.4%). These studies also
include targeted efforts in this project period to increase the number of applications funded at
our regional center for both basic, clinical and translational diabetes efforts. We anticipate
funding six Pilot & Feasibility grants at steady state, with three new and three continuing awards
each, typically over a two-year period. The P&F study Program has enabled recipients to obtain
data and publications that constituted the basis for successful applications for extramural
support. Under the same administrative umbrella as the Pilot & Feasibility Program, we have
established a Microgrant award Program that provides specific support for the use of ES-DRC
Core facilities. Last year, the Microgrant Program funded six awards for the use of the non-
invasive imaging component of the Translational Research Core. In addition, we also work in
collaboration with the CTSA to support Catalytic Seed Grant Awards to enhance diabetes-
specific translation research. These value-added programs further enhance diabetes directed
research efforts and provides additional enhancements to the Program. To continue these
established and new initiatives within the P&F Program, we will: 1) advertise and organize the
yearly pilot and feasibility grant competition cycle; 2) support mechanisms for interaction and
collaboration among established researchers in diabetes and related areas and for those who
are new to the field; 3) provide mentoring and guidance for investigators who are new to
diabetes research to facilitate generation of preliminary data with the goal of successful
applications for NIH funding and other funding sources; 4) communicate responsibilities and
opportunities to P&F awardees by integrating them into ES-DRC activities; 5) provide $10,000
free use of appropriate ES-DRC Biomedical Core services directly related to the funded P&F
project; and 6) manage/support the institutionally supported Microgrant and Catalytic Seed
Grant Award programs in diabetes and metabolism."

10833012,"Preclinical Modeling, Imaging & Testing Core: Project Summary/Abstract 
The Preclinical Modeling, Imaging & Testing Core (PMIT Core) is a critical Shared Resource in the Koch Institute’s 
mission of combining the strengths of discovery cancer research and engineering-based technology development to 
advance the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Critical to this effort are in vitro and in vivo disease models, including 
cells, organoids and vertebrate models. These are used to probe the role of cancer genes in cell biology, investigate the 
mechanisms of tumor development, progression and metastasis, evaluate drug response and resistance, and test novel 
strategies and devices for tumor detection and drug delivery. Each of these approaches relies on expertise and 
instrumentation to facilitate the generation of disease models, as well as their characterization via imaging and in 
response to drugs, nanomaterials, vaccines and devices. The PMIT Core provides Koch Institute investigators with 
consultative advice, technical support and/or training in the production of engineered cells and mouse models, and 
provides extensive imaging, husbandry and analytic resources for detection, characterization and therapeutic treatment 
of tumors in animal models.
During the current period, usage of the PMIT Core increased significantly and now 71% of CCSG Members 
(representing all three programs) rely on the Core’s services. To support this demand, we also expanded several 
capabilities. This includes, for disease modeling: CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing capabilities, and specialized cell and 
organoid generation and manipulation methods. We also expanded imaging capabilities by hiring an MRI Specialist (as 
recommended in the previous competing renewal), acquiring PET/CT instrumentation (with one-time Institutional funds), 
and hiring a PET/CT Technical Associate (with short-term Institutional funding). Thus, this Shared Resource is essential 
to the success of the Koch Institute mission.
In the upcoming period, the PMIT Core will continue to offer a wide range of disease modeling, animal imaging and 
preclinical testing services to support the research programs of Center Members. We will upgrade ultrasound and 
microCT instrumentation (with funds from Institutional sources), and acquire expertise and computing capabilities that 
enable use of machine learning algorithms in high throughput data analysis (funding requested from CCSG 
Developmental Funds). To stabilize staff salaries and allow support of the PET/CT Technical Associate, a 20.2%
increase in the PMIT Core CCSG budget is requested."
10833014,"Integrated Genomics & Bioinformatics Core: Project Summary/Abstract
Modern cancer research relies on a broad array of genome-wide approaches. The mission of the Koch Institute
Integrated Genomics & Bioinformatics Core (IGB Core) is to support the acquisition of genomic and gene
expression data and the organization and analyses of the resulting large and complex data sets through
advanced technology service platforms, state-of-the-art computational infrastructure and expert bioinformatics
capabilities. It provides Center Members with integrated and comprehensive services including consultative
services and training in experimental design and data analyses and technical pipelines from sample generation
and quality control to sequencing and informatic analysis to allow investigation of: mRNA, microRNA and lncRNA
expression; splicing events; transcription factor binding sites; epigenetic modifications; point mutations and
chromosomal abnormalities; and single cell genomics. In the prior renewal, the Genomics and Bioinformatics
Cores were presented as separate entities. We have now combined these into the IGB Core, reflecting the critical
importance of integrating genomics data generation with downstream informatic analysis. The IGB Core is an
Institutional Shared Resource between the Koch Institute and three other MIT units.
During the current period, usage of the IGB Core increased from 80% to 87% of Center Members. To support
this demand, the IGB Core expanded sample preparation, quality control and processing, data analysis, and
hardware and software capabilities. This includes expanded offerings for ii) sequencing library preparation,
including development of multiple high-throughput (HT) protocols; ii) single cell acquisition/sequencing and
analysis approaches; iii) long read sequencing services and analysis; and iv) RNAseq and Epigenomics analysis
capabilities. The IGB Core also deployed new compute and data storage resources. Core staff provided
additional direct support to this CCSG through development of financial and publication database and client-side
interfaces. Thus, this Shared Resource is essential to the success of the Koch Institute mission.
In the upcoming period, The IGB Core is committed to continued enhancement of genomics technologies and
informatics expertise as well as maintaining IT hardware to support these efforts and the KI research community.
Planned initiatives include: developing additional HT methods for sequencing library preparation; further
strengthening expertise in single cell genomics applications; expanding data storage and compute cluster and/or
cloud computing in line with investigator needs; and expanding informatics training offerings to include more
hands-on workshop opportunities. This shared Core is of exceptional value to the CCSG because Koch Institute
Members account for 47% of the Genomic services usage and 87% of Informatics services usage, but the CCSG
contribution to the Core (8%) is comparable to that of the other sponsoring entities (7%) and far less than the
costs covered by user chargebacks (78%)."
10833016,"Biopolymers & Proteomics Core: Project Summary/Abstract
The ability to sensitively and quantitatively analyze proteins, peptides, small molecules and metabolites is critical
to understanding differences between normal and disease states in cells, tissues and organisms. Such analyses
typically require sophisticated technical expertise and state-of-the-art instrumentation. The Biopolymers &
Proteomics Core (B&P Core) provides Koch Institute researchers with a diverse range of services, with an
emphasis on protein/peptide, proteomic and mass spectrometry services, that enable both synthesis and
analysis of biological materials. These are technologies that individual researchers usually do not learn, but are
essential for modern cancer research, and as such the Core provides access to these techniques.
In the current funding period, the B&P Core added new capabilities and modified existing services, including:
acquisition of two new hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap MS instruments with funds from Institutional sources to expand
proteomics analysis capacity and improve sensitivity; upgraded HPLC with funds from Institutional sources to
enable improved fractionation of complex samples and added independent HPLC use; and expanded expertise
in HPLC analysis and purification (e.g. small molecule-drug conjugates). Center Member Core use has been
strong: 84% of Center Members use the Core, account for 74% of Core service use, and include investigators
from all three Research Programs.
In the upcoming period, the B&P Core will continue to offer a wide range of state-of-the-art services to support
Center Member research programs, and will evaluate emerging capabilities in the context of Center Member
needs and interests. A number of new initiatives are planned, including: expansion and enhancement of
proteomics capabilities in global and quantitative proteomic analysis, detection of post-translational modifications
and identification of binding partner profiling; and improved investigator support for mass spectrometry-related
informatics and complex proteomic data analyses. The B&P Core is also committed to maintaining
instrumentation at the leading edge, and will continue to closely monitor technological improvements, particularly
with regard to LC-MS instrument sensitivity, specificity, operation, and speed. The Core has taken advantage of
leasing and vendor consignment programs to provide more frequent instrumentation updates, allowing the Core
to pilot new advances and technologies at lower relative cost. In the upcoming funding period, we will conduct a
hands-on assessment of Center Member needs with respect to metabolomics capabilities. Funding for any new
equipment acquisitions will be solely from Institutional sources. This Shared Resource is essential to the success
of the Koch Institute mission and provides exceptional value to the CCSG. The requested CCSG budget for Year
49 is increased by 18.5% over the Core CCSG budget for the current period (Year 48), reflecting increased
support for proteomics expertise."
10833019,"Flow Cytometry Core: Project Summary/Abstract
Flow cytometry is an essential method in cancer research. It is widely used to identify, track and purify specific
cell populations through analysis of cell surface markers and/or fluorescent reporter genes, and also to assess
cellular phenotypes, such as cell cycle progression, DNA damage or apoptosis responses. Flow cytometry also
supports a broad range of engineering-based approaches, such as quantification of targeting efficiencies for
antibody- and copolymer-based therapeutic delivery systems, and high-throughput approaches to develop
fluorophore-based protein labeling and imaging technology. The Koch Institute Flow Cytometry Core is a
Shared Resource that provides Center Members with training in, and access to, state-of-the-art cell sorting
instrumentation, technical expertise and training, and data analyses.
In the current period, the capabilities of this Core were further expanded and enhanced. Two new analyzers
and two new sorters were acquired, replacing older obsolete instrumentation, and three systems were
upgraded with new lasers to expand detection capabilities. Core service usage by Center Member has
remained high (93% of Center Members). In addition, using CCSG Developmental Funds, the Core has
supported a Research Specialist who has established a suite of single cell-associated technologies, including a
collaboration with the Koch Institute Integrated Genomics & Bioinformatics Core to enable high throughput
single cell mRNA sequencing. These services are now well-developed services within the Core, and we seek
continued, partial funding to support the Research Specialist’s efforts.
In the upcoming period, the Flow Cytometry Core will continue to offer a wide range of state-of-the-art services
to support the research programs of Center Members and will evaluate emerging capabilities in the context of
Center Member needs and interests. The Core intends to evaluate high parameter cell sorting, addition of
robotics capabilities for automated sampling, mass cytometry, and multiplexed ion beam imaging. The Core
will also expand training opportunities, including hands-on data analysis workshops. This Shared Resource is
essential to the success of the Koch Institute mission and provides exceptional value to the CCSG because
Koch Institute Members account for 84% of the Core services usage. The requested CCSG budget for Year 49
is increased by 9.2% over the budget in the current period (Year 48), reflecting the request for additional
funding to stabilize support for the new single cell analysis capabilities."
10833021,"High Throughput Sciences Core: Project Summary/Abstract
The Koch Institute High Throughput Sciences Core (HTS Core) provides automated technologies, expertise and
training that allows Cancer Center Members to investigate the interplay between biomaterials, biomolecules, small
molecules and cells in a high-throughput, multiplexed manner to enable drug and gene discovery, drug delivery,
toxicology, and systems biology applications. The HTS Core possesses state-of-the-art robotic instrumentation, an
array of biological tools, including validated cell lines and curated libraries, and an exceptional staff with expertise in
assay development and adaptation, screening execution, and robotics workflows. HTS Core activities were
established in 2011, with support from CCSG Developmental Funds and Institutional support. In the prior
submission, HTS activities were embedded in the Koch Institute Genomics Core, reflecting their extensive
interactions. During this current period, the HTS Core has greatly expanded its roles and impact for both Center
Members and other Koch Institute Cores. Given this, and on the advice of our SAB, we are requesting funding for
High Throughput Sciences as a stand-alone Core.
In the current funding period, the HTS Core added a significant number of new capabilities and modified existing
services, including: a new high throughput flow cytometer and tissue processing equipment; added >55,000 new
compounds to small molecule libraries; automated workflows for ELISAs, high content imaging and HT sample
preparation pipelines, including automated plate-based HT ChIP-Seq sample preparation (collaborating with the
Integrated Genomics & Bioinformatics Core); and cell line management services, including mycoplasma testing and
banking of mycoplasma-free cell lines. Center Member Core use has been strong: 66% of Center Members use the
Core, account for 73% of Core service use, and include investigators from all three Research Programs.
In the upcoming period, the HTS Core will continue to offer a wide range of state-of-the-art services to support
Center Member research programs, and will evaluate emerging capabilities in the context of Center Member needs
and interests. A number of new initiatives are planned, including: acquisition and evaluation of new equipment;
upgrades to existing equipment; acquisition of new CRISPR and targeted small molecule libraries; establishment of
small molecule screening in zebrafish; continued collaboration with other Koch Institute Core Facilities to develop
technology and streamline workflows; deployment of a custom-built LIMS system to manage library materials and
screening assay data; dataset sharing to support development of machine learning algorithms; and collaborating
with other Koch Institute Cores to develop a monthly workshop series to support Center Members’ access to
imaging technology platforms and data analysis. This Shared Resource is essential to the success of the Koch
Institute mission and provides exceptional value to the CCSG. The requested CCSG budget for Year 49 is
increased by 1.6% over the Core CCSG budget for the current period (Year 48)."
10833295,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We propose to develop peptide ligands that bind to membrane receptors known to malfunction
in maladies such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. Our preliminary data indicate that we
have designed several peptide ligands that can activate or inhibit different receptors. The basis
of the efficacy of the peptides is that interactions between transmembrane (TM) domains is
critical for receptor function. These peptides are intended to bind to the TM domain of their
target to revert defective receptor activity. Membrane insertion of the peptides is controllable, as
they are triggered by environmental acidity. We will also develop a new generation of peptides
where membrane insertion is triggered by an array of different stimuli. This would provide
means of targeting the peptides to the desired tissues.
To improve our ability to study the interactions between TM domains, we will develop a new
single-molecule method that allows us to obtain stoichiometric and thermodynamic information.
These studies will be complemented with investigation of how TM domains influence lipid
dynamics. In addition to the development of these peptide ligands, we will perform systematic
analyses to understand the molecular mechanism by which similar peptides can activate or
inhibit membrane receptors. Through this work we seek to provide promising new therapeutic
approaches and invaluable functional knowledge of how peptide ligands can modulate disease
causing membrane receptors."
10857206,"Project Summary
Dopamine (DA) is an established neuromodulator in brain reward pathways. It is increasingly recognized that
regulatory factors acting within the striatum sculpt local DA release, complementing the role of midbrain DA
neuron activity in supplying DA to target regions. We have reported that glucose-induced increases in levels of
the metabolic hormone insulin acts as a reward signal in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Using ex vivo striatal
slices, we discovered that insulin enhances DA release in the NAc and dorsal striatum, and that insulin
responsiveness is lost in rodents that are obese from a high-fat high-sugar (HF-HS) diet. Our companion
behavioral studies show that insulin action in the NAc is necessary for flavor-nutrient learning with glucose-
containing solutions, and for the escalation of glucose intake seen during training. Although understanding of
this reward pathway is far from complete, we have established the pivotal role of a striatal microcircuit involving
DA axons and striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs), both of which express insulin receptors (InsRs). An
abundant literature indicates that acetylcholine (ACh) from ChIs promotes DA release via β2-subunit containing
nicotinic ACh receptors (β2-nAChRs) on DA axons. We showed previously that insulin acting at InsRs increases
ChI excitability, and that the DA-boosting effect of insulin is prevented by β2-nAChR-selective antagonism, and
is absent in mice that lack striatal ACh synthesis (ChAT KO mice). However, key elements required to understand
and harness this pathway are missing, including: 1) cellular mechanisms by which insulin increases ChI activity;
2) specific components of flavor-nutrient learning influenced by insulin and whether they are blocked by β2-
nAChR antagonists and impaired by a HF-HS diet; and 3) patterns of insulin-dependent synaptic plasticity in
NAc medium spiny output neurons (MSNs) that underlie flavor-nutrient learning. These missing elements will be
addressed in three specific aims that capitalize on the complementary expertise of the PIs. Overall, our previous
and pilot data show that NAc insulin signaling is necessary for flavor-nutrient learning, which guides food choice
and consumption based on predicted nutritive yield. This insulin-dependent reward learning is impaired in
subjects with InsR subsensitivity induced by HF-HS feeding, leading to maladaptive consumption. By identifying
cellular mechanisms and pathway-specific plasticity that drive nutritive learning, this project will not only answer
key questions about NAc insulin, but also indicate targets that might bypass subsensitive NAc InsRs and restore
healthy eating."
10857214,"Mobile technology is poised to revolutionize rehabilitation research, but the infrastructure and training to
support researchers in designing effective studies, collecting and analyzing data, and translating findings to
improve care has not kept pace with the mobile technology industry. Our Center for Reliable Sensor
Technology-Based Outcomes for Rehabilitation (RESTORE Center) will establish vital research infrastructure
and training that enables rehabilitation scientists to use mobile sensors to monitor a diverse set of real-world
outcomes. We will accomplish this by integrating expertise from bioengineering, statistics, computer science,
mobile health, and clinical rehabilitation. Our mission is to launch a world-wide collaboration involving hundreds
of researcher teams to collect and share real world data on rehabilitation outcomes. To achieve this, we will:
 1. Provide state-of-the-art software to convert wearable sensor data into meaningful outcome metrics,
 create a data sharing repository with a vast set of movement and outcome data, and develop advanced
 data science tools to gain insight from real-world rehabilitation datasets.
 2. Train thousands of rehabilitation scientists to use mobile technology for research through bootcamps,
 conference-based tutorials, an online knowledgebase, and massive open online courses.
 3. Attract and train talented scholars from physical therapy, physiatry, computer science, biomechanics,
 and other fields to become experts in mobile technology and the needs of the rehabilitation community.
 4. Award 65 seed grants to innovative and meritorious projects to accelerate the use of mobile technology
 in rehabilitation research and advance patient care.
 5. Encourage the appropriate use of mobile technology in rehabilitation research and foster
 interdisciplinary collaborations through a multi-faceted promotion effort. Our broad outreach program
 will expand the group of over 14,000 researchers who are currently using our resources.
 6. Establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable Medical Rehabilitation Research Resource Center
 through the leadership of an experienced executive team that will manage the Center’s activities.
By providing high-quality, in-demand, and open-source software tools, our Center will enable a collaboration of
unprecedented scale between bioengineers, physical therapists, computer scientists, patients, physicians, and
others focused on rehabilitation. Our training efforts will create a new generation of rehabilitation scientists who
are fluent in the strengths and challenges of mobile technology. Our Center will be run by a tightly integrated
clinical and engineering team, enabling us to appreciate the needs and goals of patients, recruit participants to
our studies, and rapidly create valuable new technology. Together with the RESTORE Center community, we
will achieve the potential of mobile technology to monitor real world function and improve care for conditions
including stroke, Parkinson’s disease, osteoarthritis, frailty, cerebral palsy, and low back pain."
10853841,"We request the Affinity Isothermal Titration Calorimeter (ITC) from TA Instruments (Waters Corporation) which
is robust (user error is unlikely to harm the instrument) and sensitive. ITC provides accurate, label-free, and
direct measurement of affinity between two molecules, number of binding sites, enthalpy and entropy of
binding, and change of heat capacity upon binding. ITC will increase the rigor of binding measurement
performed at the University of Montana (UM) as other direct binding measurement methods currently available
at UM require surface attachment or labeling of one of the binding partners and are less sensitive for similar
sized binding partners (e.g., surface plasmon resonance and fluorescence-based methods). UM-available
indirect binding methods require calculation of affinity using assumptions that often cannot be verified (e.g.,
competitive fluorescence anisotropy). ITC will advance the research objectives of the UM research community
including six minor user projects, and the 3 major user NIH-funded projects described below:
1) Measurement of affinity between a family of transcription factors (nuclear receptors) and their cofactors.
Such data will aid in design of the next generation of nuclear receptor drugs that cause less adverse effects.
This is important because nuclear receptors bind about 1 out of every 6 approved drugs and many cause
treatment-limiting adverse effects. ITC will provide a rigorous check of the currently used indirect affinity
measurement (competitive fluorescence anisotropy). Such a check is critical because accurate affinity
measurement is fundamental to testing the central hypothesis of this work.
2) Work to accurately predict how mutations affect protein stability and the most prevalent protein
conformations. Such prediction is fundamental to many areas, including understanding the impact of genetic
information on health. ITC provides a key measure of the algorithm’s accuracy for prediction of a mutation's
effect on protein conformation prevalence. The percentage of a model protein found in one of these
conformations directly impacts its affinity for a ligand, allowing determination of the portion of the protein in that
conformation, and thus the prediction accuracy of the algorithm. In addition, because ITC measurements
provide both the change in enthalpy and entropy, ITC data permits extrapolation of binding constants obtained
at one temperature to any other temperature for efficient comparison with other data.
3) Work to measure binding affinity between the protein PlzA from the bacteria that causes Lyme disease
(Borrelia burgdorferi) and its putative and known endogenous ligands (c-di-GMP and RNA). PlzA is essential
for infectivity in mice, however PlzA’s ability to bind c-di-GMP is not, pointing to the probable importance of
RNA binding. ITC and PlzA mutants will be used to identify PlzA residues and determinants that mediate RNA
binding. In addition, ITC will be used to evaluate the binding of different RNA ligands, including recently
identified native B. burgdorferi RNAs."

 The University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) Genomics Core (GC) is requesting funds to upgrade
high-throughput genomic sequencing capabilities with the purchase of an Illumina NovaSeq X Plus Sequencing
System (NSXP). The GC has provided genomics services since 2002, initially using GeneChip microarrays,
transitioning to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in 2011 with the HiSeq 2000/2500, and advancing to a
NovaSeq 6000 (NS6K) in 2017. Demand for our NGS services has grown continuously, and we now serve a
broad user base at the University of Kansas, affiliated Kansas Institutions, the Central Midwest region, and
multiple states across the U.S. Recent advances in Illumina sequencing technology can reduce user cost,
improve sequence-by-synthesis (SBS) chemistry, increase sequence throughput and data quality, improve
onboard data analysis, and enhance file compression for more efficient data management. Unfortunately, our
current instrument is unable to take advantage of these key advances, thereby disadvantaging our investigators
with higher cost and lower sequencing quality. The proposed upgrade to the NSXP will ensure that GC
sequencing capabilities are, and will remain, optimal for the foreseeable future. In addition to regional and
national investigators representing 45 institutions across 27 states who have sought our services, the upgrade
will have significant impact for our 20 major and 5 minor users with 45 NIH grants (28 R01-equivalent) identified
in this application. Beyond aiding independent research programs, the enhanced attributes of the NSXP will
advance the research missions of multiple NIH-funded centers including the NCI-designated Comprehensive
University of Kansas Cancer Center (P30), the NIA–funded Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (P30); a
NIDDK Center for Polycystic Kidney Disease translational research (U54); an NCATS CTSA (Frontiers: The
Heartland Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (U54): and 3 Centers of Biomedical Research
Excellence (COBRE) funded by NIH P20 Institutional Development Award (IDeA) grants. The NSXP will be
located in space already optimized for Illumina NGS operations, which includes 10x Genomics Chromium X
single cell and MissionBio Tapestri single cell DNA systems, 10x Visium spatial genomics, and a forthcoming
Tecan DreamPrep NGS library automation robotics system. The NSXP will be integrated into a core network
providing comprehensive administrative infrastructure including online request tracking, automated billing, and
user-polling for quality assurance, in addition to bioinformatics support and technical support coupled to a newly
expanded IT infrastructure. The GC is backed by a strong institutional commitment for both the acquisition and
operation of the instrument. The acquisition of the NSXP will enhance rate and quality of discovery while
reducing costs by approximately 59% per gigabase sequenced, thereby providing our large and diverse
investigator clientele with improved data quality and savings that can be applied toward other health-related
NIH-funded research."
10835070,"Project Summary / Abstract
The ability to image specific gene expression and cellular signaling pathways has long been a powerful tool for
scientists, and the methods to achieve this goal, such as the fluorescent reporter genes, are widely used
nowadays across different fields of biomedicine. However, the penetration depth of light has limited the use of
fluorescent reporter genes in animal models and cell-based therapies in humans. To this end. a group of gas-
filled protein nanostructures named gas vesicles (GVs) were recently introduced as the acoustic reporter genes
and enabled, for the first time, the use of ultrasound imaging to visualize specific gene expression in cells located
at centimeter-deep tissue. GVs are sub-micron particles originally evolved in photosynthetic microbes to achieve
cellular flotation, and expectedly, these wildtype GVs do not possess the correct properties that can maximize
their detection by ultrasound. This limitation on imaging sensitivity is perhaps the biggest hurdle currently facing
the application of the first-generation acoustic reporter genes. In this proposal, we aim to introduce the second-
generation acoustic reporter genes by innovating the mechanical properties of the protein shell. In Aim 1, we will
leverage the Genetic Code Expansion technology to achieve site-specific crosslinking among the monomeric
shell proteins. This is to recognize that the inward buckling of the protein shell holds the key to the sensitive
detection of these acoustic protein nanostructures but often leads to the rupture of the wildtype GV shell, and a
systematic crosslinking will substantially increase the tensile strength of these protein shells. Specifically, we will
systematically search sites that allow the incorporation of non-canonical amino acid and lysine for proximity-
induced chemistry, and this search will be performed under the rational guidance of the structural models. In
parallel to Aim 1, we will develop finite-element modeling and acoustic measurement method in Aim 2 to
understand the effect of crosslinking on the mechanical properties of the shell, which will establish benchmark
values and aims for the design of the protein nanostructures. In Aim 3, we seek to establish sensitivity
enhancement of these rupture-resistant acoustic protein nanostructures in a rodent model. Our interdisciplinary
approach merges synthetic biology, chemical biology, acoustics, and solid mechanics, and if successful, this
high-risk high-gain project will lead to a new generation of ultrasensitive acoustic reporter genes that broaden
the technology to many therapeutic and diagnostic applications, especially in the functional tracking of cell-based
therapies and targeted imaging of biomarkers."
10835074,"Project Summary/Abstract
To obtain grants and successfully conduct biomedical research with human subjects,
researchers must recruit and retain sufficient numbers of participants. Literature on ethical
concerns with coercion and undue influence abounds, but there is little consideration of whether
it is ethical to employ behavioral economics techniques called “nudges” that can encourage
participation, such as screening surveys that predispose participants to consent, structured
choice architecture in consent forms, certain forms of community engagement to generate
group support for participation, and certain positive personal behaviors by recruiters. In addition,
little prior empirical research has examined what recruitment nudges are actually being used in
recruitment into human subjects research and their effects. This project addresses to what
extent recruitment nudges are being used in recruitment into clinical trials, whether they impact
participation, the views of human subjects about their use, and whether their use is ethical in
research studies with varying ratios of risk to human subjects. To address these issues, this
interdisciplinary investigator team of translational scientists, bioethicists, and legal scholars at
Case Western Reserve University and the University of Utah will first identify use of different
types of recruitment nudges in clinical trials with varying ratios of risk (minimal risk vs. more than
minimal risk) and benefit (direct benefit vs. no direct benefit) to human subjects. Aim 1 will
characterize use of recruitment nudges in clinical trials with varying risk/benefit ratios by
conducting interviews and a survey with clinical trials recruiter. Aim 2 will examine the effects of
a set of nudges on recruitment into a minimal risk interview study for healthy adult volunteers
and views of participants on the use of nudges for themselves and others. Aim 3 will utilize the
empirical data generated in Aims 1 and 2 to identify the normative, legal and ethical
considerations for different recruitment techniques used in clinical trials and propose policy and
practice recommendations."

This is a competing renewal application for the Tulane BIRCWH Program, which has successfully trained a
racially/ethnically and professionally diverse group of interdisciplinary researchers in women’s health and in-
creased awareness of women’s health research at Tulane over the last 4 years. We propose now to build on
our prior success and expand and reinforce the BIRCWH program base. The long-term goal is to increase the
number and diversity of highly trained culturally competent, independent, interdisciplinary investigators in
Women’s Health with an emphasis on Sex/Gender Differences research in the fields of cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD), infectious disease (ID) and neuroscience (NS). The program will focus on CVD, ID and NS be-
cause of the impacts of these diseases on women, the existing knowledge gaps on the sex/gender differences
across the research spectrum, and the strength of these areas at Tulane. Key components of our successful
career development plan include 1) didactic courses tailored to specific Scholar needs; 2) individualized ca-
reer development training; 3) BIRCWH seminar series; 4) Work-in-Progress sessions; 5) required grant & sci-
entific writing and project management workshops; 6) mentored interdisciplinary research; 7) responsible con-
duct in research training. The innovative approach includes tailoring the program to Scholars needs using self-
efficacy assessment and career development plans, and using a network mentoring model for each Scholar,
including expertise in both basic science and clinical research. Scholars are immediately exposed to research
and are guided to establish a scholarly track record early, and gain presentation and organization skills by ac-
tive participation in the Health Sciences Research days-Women’s Health/Sex Differences Section. New com-
ponents of the enhanced BIRCWH program include expanding capacity with the recently established Tulane
Center of Excellence in Sex-based Biology and Medicine (TCESBM); increasing faculty participation in ex-
panded fields of ID and NS; building Scholar competence in team science and equity,diversity, and inclusion
(EDI) in research; and advancing understanding of the interplay between sex/gender with social determinants
of health (SDOH). The Scholars will learn cutting-edge research methods and skills from Bench (cellular, mo-
lecular, genetics), to Bedside (clinical research, clinical trials) to Population (epidemiology, prevention, health
services research) and conduct their own research projects in established laboratories/groups in a mentored,
interdisciplinary environment that address the 2019-2023 Trans-NIH Strategic Plan for Women’s Health Re-
search. Scholar’s interdisciplinary research will focus on sex/gender differences in CVD, ID, and NS and ad-
dress overarching themes (lifespan, sex/gender determinants, health disparities, interdisciplinary research).
We propose to train 6 faculty Scholars for 2-3 years (3 years typical for physician-scientists). Ongoing, com-
prehensive evaluation will guide improvements to the program's demonstrated success in bridging research
training & research independence for junior scholars focused on sex/gender differences in CVD, ID, and NS."
10839696,"ABSTRACT
Treatment lapses remain one of the most enduring challenges to viral suppression in Africa. These individuals
have higher rates of viremia (~70%), morbidity, and mortality, and now represent the majority of those
hospitalized with advanced HIV. Even among those who return to care, 30-50% have repeat lapses due to
ongoing challenges with care such competing obligations, travel/mobility, clinic-based, or psychosocial barriers.
Effective strategies for durably reengaging individuals with treatment lapses must address two steps: they must
first be brought back into care, but after return, person-centered strategies are needed to prevent repeat lapses
and keep them reengaged long-term. Navigation (NAV) and community-based medication delivery (CB-Med)
are strategies that have been found to improve outcomes among those newly initiating or stable on ART, and
our preliminary data indicates their complementary mechanisms hold promise to address key challenges at both
the return and reengage stages. NAV offers a flexible approach to tailor outreach, care coordination, and
psychosocial support to match individuals' unique barriers to care. Leveraging navigators to provide ongoing
CB-Med efficiently adds instrumental support to further reduce challenges with medication access. Still, rigorous
evidence on the use, timing, and optimal combinations of NAV and CB-Med after treatment lapses is lacking.
For example, offering NAV+CB-Med may improve rates of ART re-initiation, but this may not translate to better
longer-term outcomes if it is stopped after return and individuals then receive the same care that previously
failed. We propose a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) among 1270 individuals who are
>30 days late for an appointment to assess different sequential combinations of return to care and reengagement
strategies. We randomize participants in the first-stage to receive (1) routine phone outreach only (standard of
care [SOC]) or (2) NAV+CB-Med for rapid ART re-initiation in the community and reentry support. Among those
who return to care, we re-randomize them in the second-stage to: (1) routine care and counseling after return
(RCC [SOC]), (2) NAV only after return, or (3) NAV+CB-Med after return. In Aim 1a, we compare phone outreach
only vs. NAV+CB-Med on time to ART re-initiation and return to care. In Aim 1b, among individuals who return,
we compare RCC, NAV alone, and NAV+CB-Med on retention in care after return (time to missing a pharmacy
refill by >14 days). In Aim 2, we assess the overall effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the six sequential
combination return-and-reengage strategies embedded within the SMART design on viral suppression at 18-
months after initial randomization (primary outcome). Lastly, in Aim 3 we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation
to understand implementation (e.g., reach, adoption, fidelity, acceptability), mechanisms of action, and potential
for sustainability among diverse stakeholders (e.g., participants, health care workers, public health officials). This
proposal advances a high-priority research agenda to identify the most effective and efficient combination
strategies to both return individuals with treatment lapses to care and then keep them reengaged."
10840882,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Regular exercise promotes physical performance and health, and prevent various types of diseases. These
benefits are largely mediated by responses and adaptations, particularly mitochondrial remodeling, in skeletal
muscle. 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a bioenergetics sensor that is critical for the maintenance
of metabolic homoeostasis, and AMPK signaling has been linked to mitochondrial remodeling and functional
adaptations under normal and disease conditions. However, the precise mechanism of AMPK signaling in
control of mitochondrial remodeling with subcellular specificity remains obscure. We discovered a physical
association of a novel AMPK complex (α1, β2 and γ1 subunits) with mitochondria (referred to as mitoAMPK) in
and unveiled its activation (T172 phosphorylation) under exercise and ischemic conditions. We have also
obtained preliminary data to show that inhibition of mitoAMPK blocks exercise-induced mitophagy, a key step
in mitochondrial quality control, in skeletal muscle. We now propose a completely novel hypothesis that
mitoAMPK is preferentially activated at energetically stressed mitochondria during exercise, mediating
precision mitophagy of dysfunctional or damaged mitochondria for functional and metabolic
adaptations To test this hypothesis, we propose:
1) Determine if mitoAMPK is preferentially activated at energetically stressed mitochondria in skeletal muscle.
2) Elucidate the role of mitoAMPK in exercise-induced mitophagy.
3) Eetermine the functional role of mitoAMPK in exercise training-induced functional and metabolic
adaptations.
 The proposed studies will capitalize on our novel findings of mitoAMPK that reveals completely new
regulatory and functional features of this important signaling molecule in muscle biology and metabolism. The
experimental design and model systems are both conceptually and technically innovative. The findings will
significantly improve the mechanistic understanding of exercise-induced mitophagy and adaptations, with great
potential impact on the future development of therapeutics for treatment and prevention ofchronic diseases,
like type 2 diabetes."
10840886,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 A great deal of progress has been made in identifying biomarkers that signal a preclinical phase
of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that occurs after the onset of pathophysiological processes (e.g., amyloid
deposition) but prior to the appearance of clinical symptoms. While extremely valuable for disease
detection, biomarker positivity does not correspond to level of cognitive functioning in preclinical AD,
nor does it provide prognostic information about the timeline for future cognitive and clinical decline.
There is a critical need for inexpensive and easily administered methods of detecting and staging AD as
it runs its course from the preclinical to symptomatic stages. Novel neurocognitive tasks that yield early
behavioral markers of AD pathology could fill this critical need. A cognitive “stress test” that could serve
as a harbinger of impending decline among AD biomarker-positive individuals would be a significant
contribution to the field.
 The proposed project will determine the diagnostic and prognostic utility of two innovative
neurocognitive tasks – Visual Sensory Binding (VSB) and Visual Short Term Memory Binding (VSTMB) –
as novel cognitive markers of AD pathology during the preclinical and prodromal stages of the disease.
Impairment of VSB and VSTMB has previously been shown to be sensitive and specific for dementia and
MCI due to AD. VSB and VSTMB are not impacted by normal aging, depression, or non-AD dementias,
hence these tasks have great potential as cognitive markers to detect and stage early AD
pathophysiology. To further evaluate the clinical utility of these novel tasks, they will be administered to
participants from the UC San Diego Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) diagnosed as
cognitively normal (CN) or with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Data from the ADRC Clinical Core
(clinical ratings, neuropsychological test results, APOE genotype, and CSF biomarker levels) will be used
in tandem with the study-specific tasks to achieve the Aims.
 Specific aims of the project are (1) To demonstrate the diagnostic utility of VSB and VSTMB by
comparing the performance of CN biomarker positive (CN+), CN biomarker negative (CN-) and MCI
participants; (2) To determine the prognostic utility of VSB and VSTMB by evaluating their ability to
predict cognitive decline; (2a) To evaluate the ability of VSB and VSTMB to measure longitudinal change;
and (3) To explore the associations of VSB and VSTMB with CSF markers of synaptic function and
neurodegeneration.
 VSB and VSTMB are easily administered, inexpensive, and noninvasive. They could aid in the
detection and staging of preclinical and prodromal AD, and provide a valuable resource to clinicians and
researchers who need to identify individuals with early AD or predict longitudinal decline."
10840888,"Abstract:
Dendritic cells (DCs) reside at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity. They can capture
antigens, internalize and degrade them, and present antigen-derived peptides to T cells. The
signals generated in these steps result in the release of cytokines that shape T cell responses.
Due to their roles as critical antigen-presenting cells, DCs are covered with receptors capable of
internalizing antigens—especially lectins. The transmembrane lectins on the DC surface can
bind and internalize glycosylated antigens to influence DC signaling and the cytokines that drive
the differentiation of T cell subsets. As a result, lectins could be exploited to direct vaccines to
dendritic cells and to tailor the immune responses they elicit. The goal of this project is to
develop an understanding of key DC lectins to capitalize on this potential.
 Aim 1 focuses on understanding the combinatorics of lectin engagement and signaling. We
hypothesize that glycans that can bind the toll-like receptors and lectins will bias DC signaling
and therefore T cell responses. We propose to identify candidate glycans with these properties
by assessing the selectivity of DC lectins (DC-SIGN, MGL, dectin-1, dectin-2) for microbial
glycans using glycan arrays. We also will synthesize ligands that can bridge DC lectins and TLRs
to examine the impact of dual engagement directly. In Aim 2, we shall evaluate the hypothesis
that the DC lectins function as mechanosensors. Our preliminary results with DC-SIGN suggest
that particulate antigens and soluble antigens differ in their trafficking. These data suggest that
DC-SIGN can detect differences in stiffness. Pathogens (e.g., viruses, bacteria, fungi) are much
stiffer than human cells, so antigen mechanosensing may be a means of distinguishing foreign
from self. Understanding how antigen stiffness influences lectin and TLR signaling could lead to
new strategies to modulate immunity. In Aim 3, we examine immune responses to antigens that
target DC lectins and TLRs in vivo. The proposed experiments leverage our expertise in
chemical biology to test novel hypotheses regarding the signaling pathways and molecular
mechanisms that underlie how DCs shape T cell responses and, therefore, immunity. Progress
on the proposed Aims is designed to yield new strategies to recruit the immune system to treat
human disease."

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a major global public health burden. Its long-term sequelae include chronic and end-stage kidney disease. Over the first two cycles of this award, we have identified the mitochondrial biogenesis regulator PGC1 as a determinant of experimental AKI outcomes. Independent studies have not only verified PGC1-dependent renoprotection, but also extended this to protection against fibrosis following AKI. In the most recent cycle, we identified two candidate effectors of renoprotection downstream of PGC1: the metabolic cofactor NAD+ and the transcription factor EB (TFEB). The former’s amenability to clinical testing has resulted in encouraging results from observational and pilot interventional testing among actual AKI patients.  The latter coordinates an intracellular program to remove damaged proteins and organelles, including injured mitochondria that can secondarily exacerbate tubular cell injury. TFEB activation is being pursued for therapeutic mitophagy in several clinical indications.

HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that NAD+ and TFEB may promote long-term kidney protection following AKI. We propose to evaluate this hypothesis in two parallel aims.

AIMS: In Aim 1, we will evaluate the contribution of de novo NAD+ biosynthesis in two AKI-to-fibrosis models: ischemia-reperfusion injury and crystal-induced nephropathy. The interventions here include an enzyme inhibitor compound being developed for clinical testing and an inducible renal tubular transgenic mouse that exhibits renoprotection in an acute setting. In Aim 2, we will define therapeutic windows for activation of TFEB after AKI as the initial insult transitions to scarring. This Aim will apply a pharmaceutical compound being developed for clinical testing in the same two models of AKI-to-fibrosis.

CONCLUSION: Our long-term objective is to apply metabolic insights to improve renal health. We have developed the necessary tools and are fortunate to collaborate with recognized leaders for both Aims. Promising preliminary data supports each Aim. Understanding when and in what contexts activation of TFEB or repletion of NAD+ may attenuate AKI’s progression to fibrosis may not only deepen our fundamental understanding of metabolism’s impact on renal health, but also delineate potential avenues for future translational inquiry."

An immense need for selective and antigen-specific immunotherapy without global immunosuppression exists
for autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and a closely related condition known as myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody disease (MOGAD). This has prompted exploration of chimeric
antigen receptor (CAR) T cell utilization to specifically eliminate autoreactive cells. We have created a unique
version of CAR T cells in which peptide MHCII (pMHCII) was fused with signaling domains in order to recognize
specific T cell receptors (TCRs). In preliminary studies we demonstrate that these pMHCII-CAR T cells
specifically recognize a cognate TCR in vitro and can selectively kill antigen-specific CD4 T cells in vivo. Efficient
depletion of high affinity MOG-specific CD4 T cells was associated with prevention of MOG-induced experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Modifications in pMHCII-CAR construction led to
greater efficiency in eliminating lower-affinity MOG-reactive T cells which was associated with resolution of
ongoing EAE. These data suggest an “activation energy” model of autoimmunity analogous to that of a chemical
reaction, in which higher affinity self-reactive T cells are needed to provide the activation energy to initiate
autoimmunity, but lower affinity T cells are capable of sustaining the autoimmune “reaction.” To address the
hypothesis that CAR T cell technology can be used to eliminate auto-antigen-specific T cells and abrogate central
nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity in mice and humans without global immunosuppression, we have
formulated three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will improve the efficiency of low affinity T cell deletion in vivo. In Aim
2, we will test whether we can successfully target autoreactive CD4 T cells specific to all T cell epitopes of a
protein in mice, as we predict that such an approach would be useful for treatment of human disease where the
T cell autoantigen is identified by an autoantibody. Finally, in Aim 3, we will directly test whether MOGAD patients
show an increased frequency of MOG-specific T cells using pMHCII-CARs for antigen discovery. In sum, our
proposed studies will explore the “activation energy” model of autoimmunity and establish an optimal CAR T cell
approach to eliminate low affinity autoreactive TCR specificities for the treatment of ongoing autoimmune disease.
Finally, we will begin to translate these murine observations to human pMHCII-CAR T cells and assess their
potential utility in a relevant human autoimmune CNS disease."

Communication disorders (CDs), including primary developmental speech and language disorders, autism
spectrum disorder, and hearing impairment, are the most prevalent disabilities in early childhood. Early
identification and treatment of CDs supports children's short- and long-term social, emotional, behavioral,
academic, mental, and physical health outcomes and reduces educational, criminal justice, and health care
costs. Yet, children from racial, ethnic, and/or linguistic minority populations, including those living in rural
areas and/or in poverty, do not receive timely access to high-quality CD care. While long-standing structural
inequities in health and educational settings underlie these disparities, specific sources of SRD that impact
children of Color across the CD referral, identification, and treatment process, are unknown. In partnership
with five US states and diverse stakeholders, we will undertake the first comprehensive multi-state
analysis of structural racism and discrimination (SRD) in the primary system of early identification and
treatment for CDs: the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Part C Early Intervention (EI) system.
The goal of this study is to lay the foundation for evidence-based interventions that improve health equity for
children of Color with CDs age 0-3. To do so, this study applies a health disparities framework to precisely
detect, understand, and develop solutions that address sources of SRD in EI at the individual, organizational,
and community levels. In Aim 1, we will leverage 5 states' EI data systems to identify distributional inequities in
EI referral, evaluation, eligibility, and service allocation outcomes according to child intersecting identities,
indicators of community resources and opportunities, and EI process features. In Aim 2, we will contextualize
distributional inequities identified in Aim 1 through focus groups with parents of children of Color with CDs,
surveys of key professionals providing CD care in EI (i.e., pediatric primary care physicians, speech-language
pathologists, EI developmental specialists), and interviews with EI administrative leadership. In Aim 3, we will
use Nominal Group Technique, a stakeholder consensus process, to generate and prioritize practice and
policy recommendations to disrupt SRD for children with CDs. Advisors, including parents of children of Color
with CDs, adults with disabilities, EI providers, parent disability advocates, EI administrators, and scholars of
Color and/or with disabilities, will inform all aspects of the study. This project will ultimately result in a set of
comprehensive, stakeholder-informed, data-driven, and feasible recommendations to improve equity in
early CD care for the 1 in 5 children of Color affected by early CDs."

Women in HIV high burden settings are a priority population for HIV prevention, because they carry
disproportionately high fraction of new HIV infections. A recent large clinical study (ECHO Study) in four African
countries found that incident HIV infections were unacceptably high among women desiring contraception– an
average of 3.8%. These results have rightly spurred discussions about the need to strengthen integration of HIV
prevention and sexual reproductive health services. Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an attractive user-
controlled HIV prevention strategy, given its high effectiveness and safety. Integrating HIV prevention services,
including PrEP provision into care settings that women trust and access routinely may offer an efficient platform
to reach at-risk women for HIV prevention. In a recent pilot study, we demonstrated that it was feasible to
integrate PrEP provision in FP clinics with program-dedicated staff. However, that approach also highlighted the
need for delivery models that integrate efficiently with existing staff for sustainability. With a multidisciplinary
team and drawing from lessons from the pilot work, we propose to catalyze scale up PrEP provision for at-risk
women accessing FP clinics in Kisumu, Kenya – a region with an HIV prevalence of up to 28% among young
women. We will aim for a sustainable, institutionalized, and cost- and time-efficient PrEP delivery in FP clinics.
We hypothesize that FP clinics will provide woman-centered ‘one-stop’ location for PrEP and FP services that
could address barriers women face to access HIV prevention services, including lack of time, cost, and stigma
of visiting a facility solely for HIV prevention. We will conduct a step-wedged cluster-randomized trial to test a
multifaceted implementation strategy in 12 FP clinics (n=3600 women) with the following Aims: In Aim 1, we will
deliver PrEP in public health FP clinics in staged fashion, implementing and optimizing HIV prevention service
provision with existing FP clinic staffing. We will rigorously evaluate program reach, effectiveness, adoption,
implementation, maintenance, and impact using the RE-AIM framework. The multifaceted implementation
strategy to integrate PrEP in FP clinics will include: 1) provider training; 2) promotion of HIV testing, partner HIV
testing, screening for HIV and STIs risk and offer of PrEP; 3) ongoing technical assistance; 4) Audit and feedback
to optimize delivery; 5) work-flow mapping; and 6) streamlined data and PrEP supply systems. In Aim 2, guided
by the Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation
Science Research, we will assess readiness to implement, fidelity, impact on current services, facilitators, and
barriers to integration PrEP provision in FP clinic context. In Aim 3, we will assess programmatic cost, budget
impact, and affordability of integrating PrEP delivery in FP clinics in Kenya. Costs will be estimated over a 5 year
horizon considering the payer’s perspective as well as societal perspective to account for client opportunity and
financial costs. The results of this project will lay the ground for wider scale delivery of oral PrEP and next-
generation PrEP formulations in FP clinics, not only in Kenya but in other resource-limited settings globally."

Hawaii (July 2020)
Hawaii PRAMS Project Summary
 The Hawaii Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) Program
is a population-based surveillance system designed to identify and monitor maternal
experiences, attitudes, and behaviors from preconception, through pregnancy and into
the interconception period. Hawaii PRAMS provides ongoing monitoring of maternal
behaviors to determine how to reduce infant deaths, decrease low birth weights and
improve the overall health of the population in Hawaii.
 The overall goal of Hawaii PRAMS is to reduce infant morbidity and mortality by
impacting maternal and child health programs, policies and maternal behaviors during
pregnancy and early infancy. There are four PRAMS objectives: 1) Collect high quality
population-based data on maternal behaviors before and during pregnancy and during
the early life of the infant; 2) Conduct epidemiologic analysis and study of maternal
behaviors and experiences during pregnancy and early infancy and the relationship to
health outcomes; 3) Translate data analyses into useable information for program
planning, monitoring and evaluation; and 4) Increase public awareness of healthy
pregnancy behaviors to improve maternal health across the life span.
 A PRAMS questionnaire is mailed to approximately 200 new mothers per month
on all major islands of Hawai‘i. The new mothers are identified by the Office of Health
Status and Monitoring (OHSM), Hawai‘i Department of Health, from the birth certificates
of recently born infants. The Hawaii questionnaire includes questions that are asked by
PRAMS programs in all states as well as standard questions selected for inclusion by
the Hawaii PRAMS Program, in partnership with the Hawaii PRAMS Steering
Committee, other Department of Health program staff, and local healthcare providers.
The questionnaire addresses priority maternal and child health issues such as
unintended pregnancies, smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy, insurance at time
of pregnancy, contraception, post-partum depression and domestic violence. Hawai‘i
PRAMS standard questions address topics such as breastfeeding, dental care, drug
use, general health, HIV, and maternal health conditions."

10841586,"In the thymus, central tolerance should eliminate the majority of immature T cells that
express autoreactive, pathogenic antigen receptors (αβTCRs). However, an unknown number of
autoreactive cells escape deletion or commit to immunosuppressive, regulatory linage (Tregs).
Tregs control peripheral tolerance and sustain dormancy of potentially autoreactive T cells.
However, mice and humans with disabled Tregs rapidly develop multiorgan autoimmunity and die
young, manifesting polyclonal activation of almost all CD4+ clones. Thus, we hypothesized that
the number of autoreactive clones embedded in the peripheral repertoire can be much higher (i.e.
over one-third of all CD4+ cells) as compared to what is currently anticipated. In Specific Aim 1,
we will examine how the intrathymic expression of different self-peptides supports or prevents an
escape of autoreactive T cells from central tolerance. This approach will document that potentially
self-reactive CD4+ clones commonly trespass to lymphoid organs of B6 mice as quiescent cells.
Next, we will test these cells ex vivo responses to a known set of self-peptides naturally presented
by mouse Ab molecules to determine if these clones are triggered by ubiquitous or specific
autoantigens. In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate why mice expressing single autoantigen
across the body have main autoimmunity manifestation in specific organs and examine the role
of non-classical CD4+ T cells in autoimmunity in this model. In Aim 3 we will use a new single-cell
RNA seq system from 10X Genomics, to examine in individual CD4+ cells their transcriptomes
and native αβTCRs to identify genes targeted by Tregs in potentially autoreactive cells to keep
them dormant and prevent autoimmunity. Overall, this application will revisit the relative
importance of various mechanisms of tolerance in the maintenance of homeostasis to self-
antigens and can reveal new mechanisms of how Tregs control self-reactivity."
10841674,"Overview. Electrical signal transmission between cells underlies almost all physiological processes in human,
from heartbeat, to learning and memory. Neurotransmitter receptors are organized in clusters at micron-sized
inter-cellular machineries, namely synapses, throughout our nervous system to enable signal transmission.
Decades of intense research have characterized the working mechanism of most individual receptors. However,
due to technical difficulties, the clusters of receptors remain enigmatic – neither the structure, nor the functional
significance is known. In this proposal, my lab will use state-of-the-art methods and a reconstitution system to
systematically characterize the architecture of synaptic glycine receptors, which is the last major neurotransmitter
receptors whose architecture remained elusive before our work. We will also develop novel technologies for
quantitative characterization of higher-order assemblies of glycine receptors, and other proteins in the 2D setting
of lipid membranes. Following is a brief description of the proposed work.
Glycine receptors and its clustering with gephyrin scaffold. Glycine receptor (GlyR) belongs to the Cys-loop
family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. GlyRs in adult tissue are heteromeric receptors composed of
both the α and β subunits, which form clusters with scaffold protein gephyrin at synapses through a specific
interaction between the β subunit and gephyrin. Disfunction of GlyR signaling is the major cause of the rare
congenital disease hyperekplexia and related to chronical neurological pain and autism spectrum disorders. The
architecture of heteromeric GlyRs and how they form clusters with gephyrin is very limited – even the α:β subunit
stoichiometry has been under debate for decades. We have discovered an unexpected subunit composition of
GlyR, explaining the unique function of heteromeric GlyRs and clearing long-lasting confusion. We will use this
established platform to characterize all major types of GlyRs and how they interact with gephyrin.
Develop novel technologies for characterizing protein clusters in lipid membrane. My lab will develop a novel
correlated raised-total internal refection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF) and electrophysiology reconstitution
system to characterize ion channel/receptor clusters. This system has the high signal/noise ratio and single-
molecule sensitivity as traditional TIRF, and allow complex electrophysiological experiments to be performed
simultaneously with imaging. We will learn how clusters form, how they are regulated, and whether clustering
gives rise to functional effects and regulate physiological activities. The knowledge gained here will guide the
reconstitution of functional clusters for structural characterization using cryo-EM single particle and/or
tomography methods. These new methods will allow quantitative characterization of the spatial organization and
functional significance of clustering, as well as the mechanisms underlying assembly and functionality. My lab
will apply these novel methods to investigate GlyR-gephyrin clusters as the first example in class, and open new
research directions in analyzing other receptor clusters found ubiquitously in biology for signal transmission."
10841675,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from a single infectious disease agent worldwide. Vaccination
is the most cost-effective control intervention for any infectious disease. Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) remains
the most widely used vaccine in human history, but as currently used it has failed to control TB. Thus, the
development of improved vaccines against TB therefore remains a high global priority. Recent studies indicate
that BCG, when modified, administered through alternate routes, or used in revaccination, offers improved
protection, suggesting that it is well poised to make comeback.
 We have generated a novel recombinant BCG known as BCG-disA-OE which is engineered to overexpress
c-di-AMP, a potent STING agonist Our preliminary studies show that BCG-disA-OE is more effective than
BCG-WT (wild type BCG) in prevention of disease (POD) following TB challenge and also as an immunotherapy
for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) where intravesical BCG is currently the first-line therapy.
Guinea pigs vaccinated with BCG-disA-OE were significantly better protected against aerosol challenge with
virulent M.tb than with BCG-WT, and we found that BCG-disA-OE also showed superior efficacy BCG-WT in rat
and mouse models of NMIBC. Compared with BCG-WT, BCG-disA-OE leads to more potent pro-inflammatory
cytokine responses in macrophage and bladder cancer cells, a higher degree of proinflammatory epigenetic
marks, and greater myeloid cell polarization towards the M1 phenotype—changes that are all consistent with
enhanced “trained immunity”, a newly discovered phenomenon characterized by epigenetic and functional
reprogramming of innate immune cells.
 In this application, our central scientific premise is that the addition of STING agonist overexpression to
BCG will augment trained immunity changes in macrophages and provide more effective protection against TB.
To test these hypotheses, in Aim 1 we will determine the protective efficacy of BCG-disA-OE versus BCG-WT
against TB disease in non-human primates (NHPs) and against reactivation of latent tuberculosis in mice. In
Aim 2 we will evaluate trained immunity changes induced by the two BCG strains in macrophage cell lines, as
well as primary murine, NHP, and human (leukopacs from healthy donors) macrophages. We will include serial
sampling of NHP mononuclear cells from blood and BAL of NHPs as well as their post-mortem tissues obtained
under Aim 1. In Aim 3, we will characterize polarization of myeloid and lymphoid cell populations in the TB
granuloma induced by prior vaccination with BCG-WT versus BCG-disA-OE in mouse and NHP models of TB."

 This proposal seeks to expand our understanding of the mechanisms driving alpha-gal syndrome (AGS)
and to provide a strong foundation for the applicant, Dr. Onyinye Iweala, to build an independent basic and
translational research career. The candidate is an Assistant Professor of Medicine, tenure track, at the University
of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC) School of Medicine and a member of the Thurston Arthritis Research Center
and the UNC Food Allergy Initiative. The proposed project expands on her previous training in mucosal
immunology, weaving together the fields of mucosal immunity with glycolipid biology and allergic effector cell
biology in the context of a paradigm-shifting food allergy. Through formal coursework outlined in the proposal
and with help from her mentorship team, led by primary mentors Scott Commins and Wesley Burks, the
candidate will develop the technical and administrative skills needed to run a successful basic and translational
research enterprise. In the process, she will develop a unique skillset that will enhance her ability to compete
successfully for R01 grants and comparable funding mechanisms available through government agencies and
private foundations. AGS is an exciting area of food allergy ripe for discovery. By studying this condition, the
candidate will cultivate her interest in mucosal immunity and develop new expertise in glycolipid biology during
her transition from a mentored to an independent investigator.
 Alpha-gal syndrome, characterized by delayed allergic responses to red meat (mammalian meat), is a novel
allergic condition associated with tick bites and specific IgE antibody to the oligosaccharide galactose-α-1,3-
galactose (alpha-gal). Alpha-gal food allergy challenges the current paradigm for food allergy because reactions
are usually delayed, appearing >2 hours following meat ingestion; IgE antibodies are against a carbohydrate
rather than a protein; and the allergy can develop in adulthood after many years of safely tolerating red meat.
The lipid content of ingested meat appears to impact reaction consistency and severity, leading many to theorize
that alpha-gal in glycolipid form is a critical driver of symptoms in this allergy. However, no one has shown that
alpha-gal-specific (s)IgE can bind alpha-gal glycolipids or that alpha-gal glycolipids can activate allergic effector
cells. Innate or unconventional T lymphocyte populations, specifically CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T
(iNKT) cells, bind glycolipid antigens complexed with CD1d and direct immune responses to lipid. Yet, the extent
to which this T cell population drives alpha-gal allergy remains unexplored. Our preliminary results suggest that
alpha-gal-sIgE binds mammalian glycolipids and that alpha-gal glycolipids can activate basophils sensitized with
plasma containing alpha-gal-sIgE. Moreover, activated circulating CD1d-restricted NKT cells are detectable in
alpha-gal allergic subjects. Thus, we hypothesize that alpha-gal glycolipids are critical to the pathogenesis of
alpha-gal syndrome, through CD1d-mediated interactions with unconventional T cells and through IgE-Fc epsilon
receptor (FcRI)-mediated interactions with allergic effector cells."
10842262,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 The discovery of powerful new methods for the synthesis of organic compounds can be enabling for
biomedical research, e.g., by providing more ready access to known families of target molecules or access for
the first time to new classes of molecules. Catalytic and enantioselective methods for carbon–carbon, carbon–
nitrogen, and carbon–oxygen formation are of particular interest, due to issues including sustainability, the
potentially divergent bioactivity of the two enantiomers of a compound, and the predominance of such bonds
in the backbone of organic molecules, respectively.
 The substitution reaction of an alkyl electrophile by a nucleophile is a particularly straightforward
approach to the assembly of organic molecules. Classical pathways for substitution, such as the SN1 and the
SN2 reactions, are limited in scope with respect to both the electrophile and the nucleophile. Furthermore,
these pathways almost never provide access to highly enantioenriched products from readily available racemic
starting materials.
 Through the use of transition-metal catalysis, wherein the electrophile is converted into an organic radical,
it is possible to begin to address both of the key challenges in nucleophilic substitution reactions of alkyl
electrophiles–broader scope and control of enantioselectivity. For example, chiral nickel and copper
complexes can catalyze the enantioconvergent coupling of a number of racemic secondary and tertiary alkyl
electrophiles with a variety of nucleophiles.
 To date, only a small fraction of the conceivable permutations of electrophilic and nucleophilic partners for
metal-catalyzed substitution reactions of alkyl electrophiles have been explored, and still fewer such processes
have been rendered enantioselective. The goal of this research program is to address the many unsolved
challenges in this area. Efforts will focus on the development of mild and versatile methods to couple families
of electrophiles and nucleophiles that have not previously been shown to be suitable reaction partners in
aliphatic substitution reactions, including highly hindered substrates, while controlling stereoselectivity at the
same time (at up to two stereocenters), including with racemic electrophiles and nucleophiles that lack
directing groups. Success in this endeavor will substantially facilitate the synthesis of enantioenriched
molecules.
 Mechanistic studies will be pursued in order to provide insight into the pathways by which the new metal-
catalyzed substitution reactions proceed. The mechanistic investigations will facilitate reaction development,
as well as enhance the community’s understanding of fundamental chemical reactivity."
10861027,"Abstract
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic kidney disease caused by
mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes. Many patients often lose kidney function due to limited therapies to delay
disease progression. The kidney is a highly metabolically active organ that relies on specialized tubular epithelial
cells to reabsorb most of the filtered water and solutes in the body. Normal kidney tubules are highly enriched in
mitochondria and preferentially use fatty acid oxidation (FAO), which generates more adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) than glucose metabolism. However, one hallmark of metabolic derangement in ADPKD is decreased fatty
acid oxidation (FAO) and increased aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). This metabolic derangement supports the
growth of cysts that eventually lead to renal failure. We propose to study: 1) the role of enhancing FAO in delaying
progression of ADPKD, 2) the role of ketogenic diet, FGF21 signaling and ketone body oxidation in ADPKD.
Although dietary restrictions, such as time-restricted feeding or the condition of ketosis have been shown to
ameliorate renal cyst progression in animal models of PKD1 mutation, the detail molecular mechanisms are not
fully elucidated. The clinical application of long-term dietary intervention is challenging because of non-compliance
and high dropout rates. There is, therefore, a critical need to determine the roles of metabolic reprogramming and
the molecular mechanisms underlying beneficial effects of dietary intervention, such as a ketogenic diet. We
propose to investigate the effect of 5 genetic mouse models of enhanced FAO, decreased FGF21 signaling or
impaired ketone body oxidation in the kidney-tubule specific PKD1 deletion mouse model of ADPKD. The
metabolic status will be elucidated using metabolic flux analysis, metabolomics and targeted proteomics of
metabolic proteins. In addition to mouse experiments, mechanistic studies will be performed using human cell line
with PKD1 mutation. Finally, human induced pluripotent stem cell derived kidney organoids from ADPKD patients
will be applied to confirm the results observed in mouse models and PKD1 cell line. Upon completion of the
proposed research, the expected outcomes are an understanding of the role of metabolic reprogramming and
FGF21 and the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of ketosis in ADPKD progression. These findings are
expected to have an important impact by contributing to a conceptual framework that will subsequently drive
development of novel dietary interventions or supplements for ADPKD patients, facilitated by the use of iPS-
derived kidney organoids generated from ADPKD patients."
10861028,"Heart failure is a major public health problem, affecting over 6 million Americans with a 5 year mortality rate
over 40%. Heart failure has been “cured” many times in rodents, yet remains a leading cause of death in
humans. This is in part, because many of the strategies so effective in rodent models, target molecules and
processes that are essential for baseline physiology. Upon more rigorous testing in pre-clinical development,
these strategies are proven unsafe and fail to progress into the clinic. This project uses an essential gene,
BRD4, as a molecular flashlight to identify new targets that are specifically activated in pathologic conditions.
The proposal will test a thus far unstudied nuclear protein, Sertad4, for its role in activating and sustaining
pathologic gene expression programs in the cardiac fibroblast. Sertad4 is expressed in far fewer cell-types
than many recently investigated targets that have generated considerable enthusiasm, including BRD4
(expressed in all cells). It is our hope that targeting proteins with more selective expression profiles will limit
collateral damage of potential therapeutics, though no interventions are true silver bullets. Ultimately, the
proposal will establish if in vivo inhibition of Sertad4 prevents fibroblast activation and preserves cardiac
function following myocardial infarction. As an assistant professor, Dr. Stratton has assembled a supporting
team of co-investigators and collaborators to help robustly test this hypothesis. Support for the hypothesis is
found in substantial preliminary data showing that: 1) Sertad4 is essential for fibroblast activation (proliferation
and myofibroblast differentiation) in response to TGF-β1 stimulation, 2) Sertad4 protein expression is elevated
in human ischemic heart failure samples, 3) fibroblast Sertad4 expression is induced with TGF- β 1 stimulation
in a BRD4 and p38 dependent manner (BRD4/p38 are also necessary for fibroblast activation), 4) Sertad4 is
robustly expressed at sites of interstitial and perivascular cardiac fibrosis, and 5) targeting Sertad4 reduces
SMAD2/3 protein expression and SMAD2/3 target gene expression. Innovative and cutting edge approaches
are proposed to define how Sertad4 causes fibroblast activation, and determine if manipulating Sertad4
expression in vivo alters the course of pathologic remodeling following myocardial infarction. This project will
rigorously test the ability to target Sertad4 to prevent cardiac fibrosis and heart failure, while also establishing
fundamental knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms of this novel target."
10853206,"ABSTRACT
 Organ transplantation’s therapeutic reach is currently constrained by incomplete efficacy associated
with current clinical immunosuppressive regimens. Similarly cellular therapy using allogeneic cells has
established proof of principle for treatment of diabetes, Parkinson’s disease and spinal cord injury, but
application is constrained by inability to reliably prevent alloimmune injury of cell or tissue grafts without
unacceptable side effects. As such, transplant tolerance research in translational models is a longstanding,
primary focus of the MGH Center for Transplantation Sciences (CTS). For all these applications, the limited
availability of human cells, tissues, and organs would be resolved if xenotransplantation can be developed as a
safe therapeutic modality, allowing recipient-specific tailored treatments to be available timely when the need
arises and the potential recipient is situated to achieve the greatest benefit from a transplant. Transplant
tolerance and xenotransplantation research in translational models are the long-standing focus of the CTS.
 For almost a decade CTS investigators have been supported by an Architect assay platform to perform
immunosuppressive drug assays that are either unavailable locally (mycophenolate mofetile) or slow and
expensive when performed as a ‘send-out’ (rapamycin, tacrolimus, cyclosporin). In addition, the platform
provides ‘general chemistry’ values (electrolytes, biochemical parameters of organ function and metabolism).
We depend on this resource because hospital clinical laboratories are unwilling to accept NHP samples due to
infectious concerns related to B-viruses; commercial alternatives have slow turn-around times and are
unreliable and expensive. Other research investigators across many MGH Departments and Centers also
depend upon this platform for these and other assays. The existing machine is at end-of-life and is no longer
be supported by the vendor. Replacing the Architect platform is essential to our many NIH-supported
transplant, trauma, regenerative medicine, and cardiovascular research projects working in large
animals.
 We have identified a versatile high-throughput Alinity ci Assay Platform that will fully meet the needs of
existing users. If made available through this mechanism, the Alinity ci platform would be highly valuable to
multiple other investigators using large and small animal across the institution. Importantly, custom assay
development services are available from the vendor to meet emerging research needs as they are identified.
Rodent and other small-animal users do not currently have access to a versatile assay platform capable of
working with <10 µl (and as low as 2 µl) serum or plasma samples; this platform is adaptable to their needs.
In summary, the requested equipment would meet a mission-critical key need, and expand our capacity to serve
the local NIH-funded user community, as well as offer an important Core facility for an expanded user base
whose work would benefit in cost savings and reduced turn-around time available via this platform."
10861042,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of our proposal is to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities associated with nutrient-poor conditions in
tumors. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a major clinical challenge and is characterized by
a dense stroma and paucity of blood vessels. The resulting hypoxia and scarcity of nutrients forces cancer
cells to seek alternative sources of nutrients for growth. Paradoxically, cells residing in these nutrient-
deprived microenvironments are among the most resistant to therapy as a result of poor drug diffusion
and reduced cell proliferation (rendering DNA-damaging agents less effective). To target these cells, therefore,
a better understanding of the adaptive mechanisms by which they cope with nutrient deprivation is urgently
needed.
In preliminary studies, we developed a culture protocol – limiting for oxygen, glucose, amino acids, and serum
– to model the “arid conditions” of pancreatic tumors. Under such conditions, tumor cells slow down
proliferation and metabolic activity. Using this system, we performed a whole genome CRISPR screen to
identify genes required under arid conditions but dispensable under nutrient-replete (“fertile”) conditions. This
revealed a strong dependency on the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation for survival, but also suggested
that genes involved in many biosynthetic activities (e.g. translation and cell division) are detrimental under arid
conditions. Based on these results, we hypothesize that cells survive severe nutrient and oxygen deprivation
by maximizing energy generation from limited fuel supplies while minimizing the use of such resources for
macromolecule production. We further hypothesize that nutrient and oxygen deprivation alters the dynamic
crosstalk between cancer cells and other cells comprising the tumor microenvironment (TME). Importantly,
individual tumors may respond to these metabolic changes in different ways, contributing to inter-tumoral
heterogeneity. Our proposal will explore these ideas to develop strategies that target therapy-resistant
cancer cells residing in these nutrient-deprived niches.
Aim 1. Characterize the heterogeneity in metabolic adaptations to arid conditions.
Aim 2. Determine how arid conditions influence cellular crosstalk in the TME.
Aim 3. Test the activity of metabolic inhibitors against cells in arid conditions in vitro and in vivo."

Native Americans (NA) endure a disproportionate burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and CRC-specific
mortality. Screening is an effective early detection strategy to decrease preventable CRC-related deaths, but NA
have some of the lowest CRC screening rates. In Oklahoma, only 51% of NA are up to date with screening
compared to nearly two-thirds of eligible US adults. Efforts to reduce disparities in screening rates have focused
on increasing access to home stool screening. However, approximately one-half of NA in Oklahoma with an
abnormal home stool test do not complete a required follow-up diagnostic colonoscopy. As time to colonoscopy
after an abnornal home stool test is associated with greater diagnosis of late-stage disease and CRC mortality,
innovative strategies are needed to increase rates of timely diagnostic colonoscopy follow up among NA in
Oklahoma. The proposed study leverages an existing relationship with the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes to co-
develop and pilot test two digital outreach interventions to increase rates of diagnostic colonoscopy. First, mobile
health outreach (mHealth; SMS text and video messages) will attempt to increase motivation to schedule a
diagnostic colonoscopy. In addition to receiving informational texts about how and why to schedule a
colonoscopy, participants will also receive culturally sensitive videos that use personal narratives from NA
patients and other high-status Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribal members (e.g., elders). Second, current clinic
workflow requires Cheyenne and Arapaho patients to visit the colonoscopy clinical facilities for both a pre-visit
appointment and the actual procedure. This process requires a minimum of two round trips to a colonoscopy
facility of over 90 miles for most patients. We will test whether a pre-visit telehealth consultation reduces
transportation barriers. Our overarching hypothesis is that culturally sensitive digital outreach intervention will
increase motivation, reduce structural barriers, and, thus, improve rates of diagnostic colonoscopy. The first
study aim will co-develop and integrate culturally sensitive digital outreach intervention strategies into clinic
workflows, guided by NA patients and a community advisory board. Among 140 NA patients, the second aim will
determine reach, feasibility, and potential efficacy of intervention strategies using a 2 x 2 factorial design:
(Outreach Type, Factor 1) mHealth outreach vs. informational pamphlet; (Consultation Type, Factor 2) telehealth
vs. in-person pre-visit colonoscopy consultation. The primary outcome is potential efficacy, measured as rates
of diagnostic colonoscopy 60 days post-randomization. The third aim will explore penetration, acceptability, and
scalability of digital outreach intervention strategies. If effective, this first-of-its-kind and highly scalable approach
offers a substantial public health impact to reduce avoidable CRC morbidity and mortality among NA patients by
increasing rates of diagnostic colonoscopy. Findings will support an R01 Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-
implementation trial to determine clinical effectiveness and better understand context for implementation of
culturally sensitive digital outreach interventions across our Tribal partners in Oklahoma."

The K01 application for Dr. Rajarshi Mazumder, a board-certified epileptologist at University of California, Los
Angeles, will allow him to establish as an independent investigator in global health and epilepsy research. The
K01 will provide Dr. Mazumder support and protect time to achieve the following career development goals: 1)
gain expertise in molecular epidemiology-- training in design and conduct of research using genetic data and
model the effects of genes and their interactions with environmental factors; 2) Advanced statistical training for
population health; 3) Lead research in a resource-constrained setting and training in the responsible conduct of
research in global health; 4) Grant writing. To accomplish his career goals, Dr. Mazumder has assembled a
team of mentors with complimentary expertise in Uganda and the US. More than 80% of people with epilepsy
live in low-to middle-income countries, where despite the high incidences, many commonly occurring
epilepsies remain understudied and poorly characterized. Nodding syndrome and related epilepsies are such a
constellation of epileptic brain disorder that occurs in several sub-Saharan African countries. Although the
etiology of this disease is unknown, several studies have found a consistent association with the parasite,
Onchocerca volvulus (OV). As the OV parasite is not neuroinvasive, autoimmunity to Hu-Leiomodin-1, a
muscle-associated protein, due to molecular mimicry with OV antigens is thought to play a role in the
pathogenesis. Studies have also found that variations in immune responses due to HLA polymorphism might
also contribute to the etiology. However, the role of host genetics and its relationship to exposure to OV in the
manifestation of epilepsy is yet to be systematically investigated. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
families with NS share common electroclinical features forming a distinct familial epilepsy syndrome and this
electroclinical phenotype is conferred by O. volvulus-associated hu-Leiomodin-1 autoimmunity in genetically
susceptible individuals. We will pursue the following aims: 1) Characterize the epilepsy sub-phenotypes that
aggregate within the NS-affected families; 2) Investigate the role of genetic polymorphism in the human host
underlying the pathogenesis of NS-and related epilepsies; 3) Evaluate the relationship between exposure to
OV-associated Hu-leiomodin-1 antibody and host susceptibility that jointly confers risk for NS-and related
epilepsies. This study has a high global health significance, as it aims to mechanistically understand how a
parasitic disease modifies the risk of epilepsy in susceptible individuals. There is an urgent need of this
evaluation to further mitigate the risk of a neglected tropical disease. The proposal will prepare Dr. Mazumder
as an independent researcher and provide the foundation for future R01 funded studies to prevent acquired
epilepsies by early identification of susceptible individuals."

Depression is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and it is projected to become the second
leading cause of disability by 2030. Despite these results indicate the urgent need to address depression as a
public-health priority to reduce disease burden and disability, current pharmacotherapies for depression require
prolonged administration (weeks if not months) for clinical improvement and they are often associated with high
non-response rate. In contrast, recent clinical evidence has shown that a single sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine
induces a robust and rapid (within matter of hours) antidepressant effect in 70% of treatment-resistant patients.
Notably, ketamine is the first rapid-acting antidepressant with efficacy for treatment-resistant symptoms of major
depression disorder such as anhedonia. Anhedonia, defined as diminished pleasure from, or interest in,
previously rewarding activities is commonly precipitated by exposure to chronic stress and it is well suited to
study in laboratory animals.
Whereas ketamine’s primary molecular target is under debate, there is broad consensus in the literature that
activation of the AMPAR as well as induction of synaptogenesis driven by de novo protein synthesis-dependent
mechanisms are required for ketamine’s ability to ameliorate stress-induced anhedonia. Nevertheless, major
technical barriers have hindered a circuit and synaptic-level dissection of such mechanisms. Therefore,
understanding the detailed circuit and synaptic mechanisms and establishing a causal link between ketamine-
evoked AMPAR-mediated synaptic plasticity and specific behavioral outcomes is crucial for designing novel and
safer therapeutic targets. Here, we will tackle this question by using electrophysiology, optogenetics and recently
developed technologies that offer the unprecedented opportunity to block AMPAR as well as de novo protein
synthesis within genetically specified cells. Accordingly, the following hypotheses will be tested: (i) increased
AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission on D1-MSNs mediates the anti-anhedonic effects of ketamine, (ii)
mPFC->NAc input is necessary for ketamine-mediated amelioration of stress-induced anhedonia, and (iii)
ketamine-induced de novo protein synthesis-dependent plasticity in D1-MSNs drives ketamine-mediated
amelioration of stress-induced anhedonia. Altogether, results from these studies will increase our understanding
of the mechanisms of action of ketamine and might lead to new potential targets to treat stress-induced
anhedonia."
10837723,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Germ cell tumors (GCT) are the most common solid tumor of adolescents and young adults. After resection of
the primary tumor, many patients do not have evidence of disease elsewhere and are categorized as “clinical
stage I (CSI) patients.” The current standard of care for CSI patients is “active surveillance” with serum tumor
markers and imaging. However, between 20-50% of these patients will relapse. Moreover, the serum tumor
markers that are currently available, AFP and HCG, are present in only 50% of the cases. A biomarker that
could predict the likelihood of relapse in the immediate post-op period and detect relapse accurately in all
patients on surveillance would rationalize medical decision-making, allowing for immediate initiation of
chemotherapy in those at high likelihood of relapse and earlier detection of relapse of those on surveillance. An
accurate serum biomarker would also obviate the need for most of the serial surveillance CT scans, reducing
radiation exposure and health care costs. Our group has identified a panel of 4 serum miRNAs (miR-371a-3p,
miR-372-3p, miR-373-3p and miR-367-3p) that, in over 1500 cases analyzed retrospectively to date, appear to
be universally elevated regardless of age, gender, site of primary, or the principal histology of the GCT. We
have developed a rigorous pipeline to quantify the levels of these 4 miRNAs using quantitative reverse
transcription PCR. Each step in the pipeline maximizes sensitivity and specificity. During the UH2 portion of
this application, we propose to conduct the final set of experiments necessary to “lock-down” the analytic
process, establish a normal range of these miRNAs by which to quantify the degree of elevation of the
miRNAS in cases, demonstrate that this technology is transferrable and that concordant results can be
obtained across laboratories, and make final recommendations going into the UH3 portion of the grant on
cutpoints for sensitivity and specificity. In the UH3 portion of the application, the serum miRNA test will be
prospectively evaluated in the context of an ongoing clinical trial, AGCT1531, that is currently accruing
pediatric and adult patients in the United States and Canada and will be opening in the United Kingdom in
2019. The prevalence of the elevated serum miRNAs will be determined in the immediate post-op period and
at relapse, and a prospective assessment of the sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value of
the test will be undertaken. With the values gathered prospectively during this clinical trial, the optimal
cutpoints for sensitivity and specificity will be recommended, using receiver operating curve methodology."
10837724,"Topic DAT18-06: The prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) during pregnancy has quadrupled over the
past decade, as have maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality related to substance use. Medication-
assisted treatment (MAT) use during pregnancy reduces adverse outcomes and is the recommended,
evidence-based practice (EBP) for OUD treatment during pregnancy. Despite this, 40% of pregnant women
with OUD do not receive MAT. Currently, there are no effective strategies to expand MAT access and
availability for pregnant women, especially in rural, low-resource settings where maternal opioid use is
disproportionately high. As an initial step to address this gap, we engaged key stakeholders across a large
health system in Pennsylvania to determine barriers and facilitators to expanding treatment services in high
need, low-resource obstetric settings. Our stakeholders identified a critical need for a women-centered, low-
resource, sustainable, provider-level intervention to facilitate the adoption of MAT in obstetric settings.
Therefore, our objective in this application is to test the effectiveness of a prenatal provider education and
training program designed to facilitate the adoption of EBP for OUD during pregnancy called Project STEPuP
(Substance abuse Treatment and Education during Pregnancy and Postpartum). Project STEPuP, grounded in
preliminary and pilot work conducted by our research team, has 4 components designed to address barriers to
MAT and EBP adoption: 1) a “hub and spoke,” remotely-supported provider education and training program, 2)
addiction teleconsultation support, 3) case management and telepsychiatry support, and 4) a partnership with
health system administrators and payers to address administrative and reimbursement related needs. To
achieve this objective, we will conduct a cluster-randomized clinical trial across 12 obstetric sites in
Pennsylvania and New York. Outcomes among 870 patients will be assessed during pregnancy, at delivery
and through 1 year postpartum. Our central hypothesis is that Project STEPuP will facilitate EBP adoption,
increase MAT utilization and improve health outcomes among pregnant and postpartum women with OUD and
their children. Specifically, we aim to: 1) create organizational readiness to facilitate Project STEPuP
implementation; 2) assess the effect of Project STEPuP on provider adoption of EBP for OUD during
pregnancy; and 3) evaluate the effect of provider adoption of EBP on maternal and child health outcomes. Our
research is significant by addressing the substantial knowledge gap of how to increase MAT use in pregnancy
and innovative by examining the role that prenatal providers can play in expanding treatment access."

Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton supports many dynamic cell biological processes, such as cell
migration, cytokinesis, vesicle trafficking, and morphogenesis. Although actin spontaneously polymerizes and
depolymerizes by itself, the dynamic properties of actin need to be controlled by actin-regulatory proteins in
cells. Among many known actin-regulatory proteins, cyclase-associated protein (CAP) regulates multiple key
processes of actin dynamics. CAP is conserved among eukaryotes and has been known as an actin-monomer
binding protein for many years. However, recent studies have identified important functions of CAP, which are
critical to promote rapid actin turnover. CAP promotes disassembly of actin filaments from the pointed ends in
the presence of actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin. Spontaneous actin depolymerization from the pointed
ends is very slow and rate-limiting in actin filament turnover. The synergy between CAP and ADF/cofilin can
enhance actin depolymerization in vitro to a range that can explain rapid actin turnover in cells. However, the
precise mechanism by which CAP and ADF/cofilin induce actin depolymerization remains unclear, partly
because structural information of a CAP oligomer is limited. CAP oligomerizes under physiological conditions,
and oligomerization enhances its activity. We have recently obtained evidence that CAP is tetrameric, and our
structural model of the CAP tetramer allowed us to hypothesize a functional link between the tetrameric
configuration of CAP and processive actin depolymerizing activity. CAP also binds to the side of actin filaments
and synergizes with ADF/cofilin to promote filament severing. We hypothesize that this is due to the effect of
CAP on the helical structures of actin filaments, which then causes partial dissociation of ADF/cofilin from the
filaments. In addition to the in vitro studies, recent reports of human mutations in the CAP (CAP2) gene have
linked impairment of CAP to human diseases in the heart and skeletal muscle involving abnormalities in the
actin cytoskeletal organization. We will use the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a relevant model
organism to study roles of CAP in the assembly of sarcomeric actin filaments in muscle cells in vivo. We
proposes three aims: (1) to determine functional significance of CAP tetramerization for actin filament
disassembly, (2) to determine the effects of CAP on the helical structures of F-actin, and (3) to determine in
vivo roles of CAP in actin cytoskeletal integrity in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We will employ a
combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to gain new insight in the function of CAP in actin cytoskeletal
regulation."

Sequencing Core. However, the capability of this core was limited to single-gene sequencing. While this was an

Among viruses that cause disease in humans viral zoonoses within the family Paramyxoviridae and order
Bunyavirales contain pathogens that cause significant lethality. Importantly, within the Paramyxovirdae the
zoonotic henipavirus Hendra virus (HeV) is on the World Health Organizations (WHO) Priority Pathogens list.
Notably, henipaviruses stand out for their impressive lethality with case fatality rates averaging about 75%. The
Arenaviridae and Phelboviridae families contain viruses that cause severe hemorrhagic disease in humans.
These viruses include the arenaviruses Lassa virus (LASV) and Junin virus (JUNV) and the phleboviruses Rift
Valley fever virus (RVFV) and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV). LASV and RVFV
are also included among the WHO List of Priority Pathogens and pose threats to global public health due to the
absence of approved vaccines or therapeutics. There is a clear unmet need for medical countermeasures to
combat the threat of natural outbreaks, epidemics, or deliberate release. The synergistic activities of the Center
partners will be focused on developing novel vaccines, treatments, and tools to support pandemic
preparedness. Federal law requires that the paramyxoviruses, arenaviruses, and phleboviruses used in the
Center be handled in approved Biosafety Level (BSL)-3 and BSL-4 containment laboratories. Core D provides
approved BSL-3/ABSL-3 and BSL-4/ABSL-4 facilities and a trained and highly experienced team of BSL-3 and

The goal of Project 5 is to develop generalizable approaches and platforms to design, make, and evaluate
mRNA-based vaccines for paramyxovirus, arenavirus, and phenuivirus antigens. We will leverage the industry
experience of Stuart in mRNA vaccines with the King lab’s leadership in structure-based vaccine design. We
will define strategies to optimize the designed antigens from Project 3 to further improve their performance
when delivered by mRNA. Additionally, we will combine the speed of mRNA vaccine manufacture with the
potency of nanoparticles to develop an mRNA-launched nanoparticle vaccine platform. This work will be made
possible by application of cutting-edge machine learning-based methods for protein design from the Baker lab
and deep pathogen-specific expertise in the Broder, Cross, Freiberg, Geisbert, Ikegami, and Veesler groups.
The central hypothesis underlying our approach is that mRNA vaccines will only realize their full potential when
combined with cutting-edge protein design. Specifically, proteins designed for optimal secretion and localization
within the membrane can improve immunogenicity. Additionally, using mRNA vaccines to launch genetically
encoded protein nanoparticle immunogens from cells in vivo can enhance the potency and durability of the
response. In summary, we will leverage the computational tools and methods developed in Project 1, along
with the antigen and nanoparticle design work from Projects 3 and 4, to develop new, generalizable strategies
for mRNA vaccine design for arenaviruses, phenuiviruses, and paramyxoviruses. In Years 4-5, we will explicitly
test if these strategies can be generalized to other members of these viral families in a “live-fire exercise”
intended to mimic an outbreak situation."
10860932,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is closely associated with osteoporosis, another
age-associated bone disorder. It has been proposed that there is an interplay between skeletal and central
nervous system independent of age. However, the mechanistic link for the bone-brain interaction has been
largely overlooked and understudied. We recently found that old mice, relative to young mice, have reduced
blood vessel density and compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in hippocampus, and our preliminary
data suggests that bone/bone marrow cells secreted cytokines/growth factors, which may contribute to these
age-associated brain vascular changes. Particularly, we detected accumulated senescent cells in bone/bone
marrow of old mice (vs. young mice) and AD mice (vs. wild-type mice). These senescent cells are primarily
bone/bone marrow mononuclear pre-osteoclasts (Pre-OCs), which acquire a unique SASP, with PDGF-BB as
the highest expressed factor. Importantly, serum PDGF-BB levels were markedly elevated in old animals (vs.
young animals) and AD mice (vs. control mice), and ablation of the Pre-OCs reduced serum PDGF-BB
concentration. Our results suggest that Pre-OCs in bone/bone marrow is a main source of elevated circulating
PDGF-BB during aging and AD progression. While PDGF-BB maintains the homeostasis of the cerebral
vasculature under physiological conditions, abnormally high concentration of PDGF-BB may lead to brain
vascular impairment. Indeed, we found that ablation of Pre-OCs attenuated age-associated cerebral vascular
impair. Our central hypothesis is that the senescent Pre-OCs in bone/bone marrow secrete excessive PDGF-
BB into blood circulation, leading to cerebral vascular impairment to accelerate brain aging and AD progression.
In Aim 1, we will determine the contribution of SnBCs to normal brain aging and AD progression using bone
marrow transplantation approach and genetic mice to induce Pre-OCs ablation. We will examine the changes of
brain pathologies and cognitive deficits during aging and AD progression. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of
PDGF-BB secreted by SnBCs in brain aging and AD progression by systemically administering a PDGF-BB
neutralizing antibody (Ab) and employing genetic mice to knock-out or knock-in PDGF-BB in Pre-OCs. We will
examine the changes of brain pathologies and cognitive deficits during aging and AD progression. Positive
findings in this study will provide new understanding on relationship between brain and bone in the development

Episodic memory binds together the people, objects, and locations that make up the specific events of our
lives, forming multi-element traces of experiences that can guide ongoing behavior, help imagine the future,
and enhance well-being. Episodic memory is poor in young children, a phenomenon called childhood amnesia.
It gradually improves over the preschool years, with further refinement in elementary school. Understanding
this developmental change requires linking research at three levels of analysis: (1) dissecting component
processes of episodic memory in controlled laboratory tasks; (2) assessing underlying neural changes; and (3)
evaluating children's naturalistic behaviors, both in the memory domain (self-related episodic memory and
memory conversations with adults) and more generally. We propose a longitudinal study of children from 4 to 6
years and from 6 to 8 years, i.e., across the offset of childhood amnesia, with rich evaluation of all three
components at three points in time. This multi-componential study across levels of analysis will be the first of
its kind.
Relational binding of multiple elements within an event may be conceptualized as the formation of coherent
multi-element episodes that allows for pattern completion, i.e., the elicitation of all components of the
experience from a subset. Another process involved in episodic memory is pattern separation. The
Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) model, as well as earlier mathematical models of the hippocampus
and later refinements of CLS, proposes that the hippocampus (HC) is specialized for the rapid and automatic
acquisition of information that is then orthogonalized to reduce potential interference among similar memories.
We will test children's abilities to retrieve all elements of an episode via pattern completion and children's
abilities to discriminate between overlapping episodes containing similar people, objects or spatial contexts via
pattern separation. In addition, a rich research tradition explores self-related episodic memories and their
retention over time, as well as their linkage to environmental support. We will link findings regarding children's
naturalistic behavior to laboratory measures of episodic memory and to neural development. These relations
are likely bi-directional in causality, and hence longitudinal evaluation is essential.
The behavioral work will be complemented by work at the neural level. Both pattern completion and pattern
separation depend on the HC and are associated with maturation of its subfields, and the maturation of
connectivity between the HC and cortical control structures. Using high-definition MRI and cutting-edge
diffusion imaging parameters, we will test the hypothesis that specific hippocampal subfields perform pattern
completion (CA3) and separation (dentate gyrus). In addition, we will test whether white matter pathways, both
within the HC (e.g., perforant path) as well as long-range tracts linking the HC to neocortical areas, relate to
pattern completion/separation behavioral performance."
10861914,"CORE E: INVERTEBRATE LONGEVITY AND HEALTHSPAN – SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This Core will assist investigators throughout the research community in quantifying a variety of longevity and
healthspan measures in two of the major invertebrate model organisms: the budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. This will be accomplished through direct collaboration,
training and outreach, and the development and dissemination of new tools and technologies. New
technologies we have developed and will disseminate include microfluidic tools for invertebrate aging studies
and the WormBot, a robotic system for high-throughput survival and behavioral phenotyping in C. elegans. We
will also work to develop chemostat-based solutions for obtaining age-matched pure populations of yeast for
biochemical and cell biological experiments requested by Core users. The focus on yeast and worms allows
us to provide services and technologies to a large number of external investigators and thereby have a
correspondingly large impact. The data generated by this Core can be correlated with high dimensional
computational analyses (Core F) and with the protein and metabolite phenotypes studied in Cores C and D,
respectively. Invertebrate models are also highly accessible to junior investigators, and Core B support for pilot
projects allows these investigators access to the full range of integrated services provided by the Center
Resource Cores."

Social Determinants of Health (SDOH), which are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, and
age, contribute to up to 80% of population health and drive health inequities. Nurses, as the largest and most
trusted segment of the healthcare workforce, are uniquely positioned to lead national efforts addressing
SDOH. However, nurse scientists responsible for generating evidence for care models have not typically
received specialized research training in addressing SDOH. Additionally, a lack of diversity in the nursing
workforce limits the profession's ability to engage populations most affected by health inequities. Our
proposed training program, Nurse LEADS (Training in Nurse-LEd models of care ADdressing the Social
Determinants of Health), aims to offer innovative training to nurse scientists at the intersection of health
equity, SDOH, and nurse-led models of care. Trainees will develop skills in digital health, advanced analytics,
engagement science, and multisector partnership as essential methodological approaches and tools for
promoting health equity. Specifically, Nurse LEADS aims to: 1) recruit and retain pre- and postdoctoral
trainees (N=10) from groups underrepresented in nursing science (> 75% of trainees) for advanced research
training in health equity, SDOH, and nurse-led models of care; 2) support trainees in contributing to emerging
theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches for developing and scaling nurse-led models of care
addressing SDOH; 3) develop trainee methodological expertise in leveraging digital health and advanced
analytics for conducting cutting-edge research evaluating nurse-led models of care addressing SDOH; 4) and
apply engagement science and multisector partnerships in the development of nurse-led models of care
addressing SDOH. Duke University School of Nursing (DUSON) will partner with two minority-serving
institutions without research doctorate training programs in nursing, North Carolina Central University
(NCCU) and the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), to attract nurses from underrepresented
backgrounds. Trainees will be supported by mentoring teams that include mentors from underrepresented
backgrounds and experts addressing SDOH. Trainees will participate in career development activities,
monthly Nurse LEADS seminars, three courses involving experiential learning practicums, tailored learning
experiences drawing from seminars, workshops, and courses from participating departments at Duke, and
training in the responsible conduct of research. Additionally, postdoctoral trainees will be required to complete
pilot research contributing to a nurse-led model of care addressing SDOH and mentor predoctoral trainees.
This novel training will enhance the capacity of nurse scientists from diverse and underrepresented
backgrounds to promote health equity and create novel, evidence-based models of care addressing SDOH."
10847061,"Project Summary/Abstract:
BACKROUND: NIMH and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have identified a
critical shortage of child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) researchers—paradoxically as most mental
illnesses are recognized as having developmental origins, with impact across the lifespan. CAP physician-
scientists are a critical part of the multi-disciplinary research workforce (including PhDs from myriad disciplines)
uniquely trained to bridge the gap between basic science and clinical translation. CAP physician-scientists are
crucial to NIMH achieving its Strategic Objectives—and vital to making substantial public health impact by
developing early detection, treatment, and prevention strategies that are effective, lasting, and resilience-
promoting. We seek to establish the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Research Institute (CAPRI) a
national research mentorship network (PAR-23-263) seated at the American Academy of Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP)—the national home of CAP physicians. CAPRI will address the
shortage of CAP physician-scientists by: (1) recruiting overlapping cohorts of 12 CAP-trained/committed
early career researcher “Scholars”; (2) providing a 2-year mentorship program, with (a) 3-day meeting at
the AACAP Annual Meeting, (b) monthly web-based career development seminars, (c) quarterly Scholar and
Mentor meetings, (d) home institution mentor integration; (3) shore up the CAP research pipeline by (a)
reaching earlier via Short Course for 12 pre-contemplative CAPs not ready for a K-award and sustaining
mentorship for Summer Medical Students, (b) enhancing retention via annual reunion & online community,
and (c) reducing attrition by creating social-belonging communities for structural barriers of race, gender,
ethnicity. Scholars will learn vital skills to begin and maintain a successful research career—scientific writing,
communication and negotiation skills, time management, giving/receiving mentoring, project management,
responsible conduct of research, and enhancing statistical knowledge and collaboration. Key Innovations:
(1) exclusive CAP focus to build a sustainable network with common experience; (2) substantial subject-
specific expertise and targeted Mentor-matching; (3) home institution mentor integration; (4) evidence-proven
science of mentoring practices from established R25s, Center for Improvement of Mentored Experience in
Research, and leaders in diversity/inclusion. Our primary outcome is Scholar submission of “K” career
development awards. Secondary outcomes are Scholar and Pre-contemplator development as academic
leaders by independent grant support, publications, presentations, academic promotion, mentorship, and
scientific service—and medical students entering psychiatry residencies. CAPRI is significant because we
directly address NIMH’s “Blueprint for Change: Research on Child/Adolescent Mental Health” and Institute of
Medicine goals to bolster the CAP research workforce via tiered, targeted, and sustaining mentorship."
10853970,"Methodological and technological innovations in high-throughput genomic and transcriptomic sequencing are
critical to the GCID’s mission of deepening and broadening our understanding of infectious diseases. However,
critical gaps remain in our ability to generate, analyze, and interpret high-throughput sequencing data for
infectious disease research. Certain scientific questions cannot be addressed using existing ‘omics
technologies and methods, and for other questions, the cost and throughput of generating and interpreting
genomic and transcriptomic data severely limit the scale at which these technologies can be leveraged.
Moreover, many genomic capabilities, and the data generated using them, are only accessible to a small
subset of the scientific community in large, well-resourced research centers. Leveraging an unrivaled
combination of interdisciplinary expertise, institutional resources, and technological infrastructures, the
Technology and Data Core (TDC) will advance methodological innovation, optimization, and dissemination that
closes these critical gaps and enables genomics-driven research at scale both within the GCID and across the
wider infectious disease research community. The TDC will accomplish this through the following three Aims:
1) develop innovative and enabling methods and tools (we will devise and implement novel methodologies and
tools that will render currently intractable questions in infectious disease accessible to genomics-driven
research), 2) optimize and scale up existing protocols and tools (we will work to further improve and optimize
cutting-edge methods and tools for sample processing and data generation), and 3) rapidly release and make
accessible new data and methods generated by our Center (we will offer access to productionized laboratory
services and containerized bioinformatic pipelines). In addition to closing key methodological and analytical
gaps for the scientific community at large, these advances will enable cutting-edge research in all four GCID
Projects, helping reveal key insights into the evolutionary paths, physiological adaptations, and cellular
interactions that underlie the impacts of viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, and vectors on human health.
Importantly, the TDC will also work closely with the Administrative Core to integrate sample and data tracking
across the Center and to facilitate timely and comprehensive sharing of protocols, tools, resources, and data."
10857273,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide
predominantly in resource-limited countries. The present Combined Antiretroviral Therapy (cART)
has significantly reduced disease mortality among patients. However, the virus still persists in
viral reservoir organs such as Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Mostly cART drugs have
failed to eradicate GALT reservoir because of its complex physiology. In this regard, drugs that
specifically reach out to that remote lymphatic tissue at therapeutic level for an extended period
of time will be of current interest. Considering the next-generation therapy for HIV-1 as one of the
priority research areas of Office of AIDS Research, we propose to develop a nanomedicine based
long-acting anti-HIV drug formulation targeting Microfold cells (M-cell) in the GALT. M-cells are
specialized epithelial cells that are predominantly present in the gastrointestinal tract. It effectively
transports many micromolecules to the underlying mucosal immune system. Considering the
transcytosis property of M-cell, we have developed a pluronic nanocarrier containing three
currently recommended anti-HIV drugs (also called nanodrug). This nanodrug is bio-conjugated
with anti-M-cell specific antibody for targeted drug delivery to M-cell. We hypothesize that an M-
cell mediated drug delivery will be more sustained and effective than conventional drugs to the
GALT."
10831405,"Detection of novel stimuli that may predict reward or punishment requires long-term
memory for, and recognition of, stimuli that are familiar. Novelty detection and familiarity
recognition are often impaired in neuropsychiatric disease, so understanding the
neurobiological underpinnings is an important goal. We recently discovered that memory
of visual stimulus familiarity is stored via synaptic modifications in primary visual cortex
of mice. The primary aims of our research are now to (a) identify how information is
stored by the collective activity of neurons in primary visual cortex and the reciprocally
connected thalamus, (b) pinpoint the key sites in the cortical microcircuit where the
essential synaptic modifications occur, and (c) determine how these modifications are
expressed at the level of circuits and behavior. Beyond the relevance of our proposed
research to identifying the mechanisms underlying visual recognition memory, they will
broaden our understanding of how primary sensory areas are modified by sensory
experience in order to modify behavior, which remains one of the great challenges in
basic neuroscience."
10831408,"Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Characterized by progressive renal dysfunction, ADPKD imposes very significant healthcare and economic burdens. It has commonly been assumed that progressive renal impairment promotes cardiac disease; however, our preliminary data suggest that cardiac dysfunction originates in cardiomyocytes and manifests prior to renal failure in ADPKD. Recent clinical evidence supports our findings by showing that ADPKD patients exhibit ventricular dysfunction before the onset of renal failure, even in non-hypertensive individuals. Mutations in the gene encoding Polycystin-1 (PC1) occur in 85% of patients and are responsible for the most severe cases. Importantly, PC1 is expressed in cardiomyocytes, yet its role(s) there is(are) poorly understood. We propose that the mutant PC1 – in a cardiomyocyte-autonomous fashion – initiates and drives heart disease in ADPKD, independent of renal failure. Our data show that PC1 cardiomyocyte-specific deletion promotes systolic and diastolic dysfunction in mice. Furthermore, using a mouse model harboring a clinically established ADPKD-causing PC1 mutation (RC allele), we provide evidence of impaired calcium-cycling and contractility at the cardiomyocyte level, which occur before the onset of renal failure. Heterozygous RC/+ young mice manifest alterations in calcium handling/contractility in isolated cardiomyocytes, which correlate with reduced left ventricular global longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction. We discovered that PC1 regulates action potential duration via Kv channel current regulation. PC1 ablation shortens action potential duration and impairs both calcium transients and contractility in cardiomyocytes. Additionally, PC1 deletion impairs sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium loading through reduced SR calcium-ATPase (SERCA) activity. These data have led us to hypothesize that ADPKD-causing PC1 mutations disrupt PC1 actions in cardiomyocytes, impair cardiac function and predispose the heart to hypertension-induced heart failure, independent of renal dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, we propose three aims: 1) determine how PC1 mutations affect action potentials and Kv channel activity and impinge on calcium handling and contractility. 2) elucidate mechanisms whereby PC1 regulates SR calcium loading and SERCA to maintain cardiomyocyte function and test the impact of ADPKD mutations in PC1 on these events. 3) determine in vivo whether alterations in PC1 signaling in cardiomyocytes drive cardiac dysfunction and predispose the heart to hypertension-induced heart failure. Completion of our studies will provide paradigm-shifting information regarding the role of cardiomyocyte-autonomous events driving heart disease in ADPKD, the leading cause of death in these patients."
10831525,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Great advances are underway in the field of dementia. Symptomatic Alzheimer’s’ disease (AD) can be
diagnosed with a simple blood test. The number of new dementia patients per capita is shrinking in parallel to
public health campaigns to improve brain health. New drugs are emerging that promise to effectively prevent or
treat dementing illness. While these breakthroughs in dementia diagnostics, prevention and treatment are
cause for celebration, hardly anything is known about whether these advances will translate to Native
American (NA) communities, where very little is known about dementia from a biomedical perspective. For
instance, only two NA at the time of this writing have available blood test data in the AD Neuroimaging
Initiative, the largest AD biobank in the United States. Approximately 200 NA have been included in the largest
AD consortium in the country out of over 40,000 participants. This lack of knowledge regarding dementia in NA
is problematic and portends a widening of already severe health disparities. The current study’s central
hypothesis is that American Indians have unique dementia risk factors and a differential effect of APOE ε4 –
the most significant genetic risk factor for AD. These factors will change the epidemiology of dementia and
preclude a “one size fits all” AD blood test using APOE ε4, The first goal of the current project is to determine
what types of dementia exist among NA Tribal Nations, which is currently unknown but is a first-step to
designing and implementing effective brain health policy. The second goal involves measuring the ancestry-
dependent effect of APOE on AD risk and AD biology in NA. AD blood tests utilize the APOE gene along with
direct quantification of the toxic proteins associated with AD to determine a positive or negative result. If
inherited from a European ancestor, having an APOE ε4 allele increases the chances of AD and also
increases the probability of a positive AD blood test result. But if a patient inherits their APOE ε4 gene from an
African ancestor, there is an attenuated impact on accumulation of toxic proteins that define AD. The same
neutral relationship between APOE ε4 and AD likely applies to NA – preliminary data from our group and
others suggest that inheriting an APOE ε4 gene from a NA ancestor similarly does not increase the risk of AD.
If an NA individual undergoes an AD blood test and carries an APOE ε4 allele, will they receive a life-changing
but false diagnosis for a devastating condition? Our study thus will measure the relationship between APOE
and AD risk/biology in NA. As APOE is also a centerpiece of personalized medicine, risk/benefit discussions
for anti-amyloid therapy, trial eligibility, and the target of genetically guided therapies, this study will provide
critical knowledge about the applicability of APOE based medical advances to NA. This is the first study to our
knowledge that attempts to bring American Indian dementia care into the 21st century and provide a
foundation for this understudied group to benefit from the latest advances in diagnosis, prevention treatment of
dementia."

Koch Institute Members use vertebrate model organisms as a key tool to study the role of known or putative
cancer genes in development and tumorigenicity; investigate the mechanisms of tumor initiation, progression
and metastasis; evaluate the role of stroma and immune responses in tumorigenesis; and assess the efficacy
of drugs, nanomaterials and devices in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Thus, it is essential that Center
Members are able to correctly diagnose developmental and tumor phenotypes, evaluate the underlying
molecular events, and accurately and quantitatively assess drug or vaccine delivery, localized tissue response,
and overall therapeutic response. The Koch Institute Histology Core is a Shared Resource that provides state-
of-the-art histological services to support these studies. This includes assistance and/or training in tissue
sectioning, slide preparation, staining and analysis, and access to the consultative services of an
internationally recognized Veterinary Pathologist, Dr. Roderick Bronson, for diagnosis of tumor and tissue
phenotypes.
During the current period, usage of the Histology Core increased from 67% to 77% of Center Members, and
included investigators from all three Programs. In response to Center member needs, the Histology Core
expanded services and instrumentation. This includes expanded offerings for immunohistochemistry and
special stains, and investigator training for independent sectioning. The Core also acquired new digital slide
scanning capabilities and quantification software, and made upgrades to existing key instrumentation. Thus,
this Shared Resource is essential to the success of the Koch Institute mission.
In the upcoming period, The Histology Core is committed to offering a wide range of state-of-the-art histological
services to support the research programs of Center Members. Planned initiatives include: working with the
Integrated Genomics & Bioinformatics Core to establish methodologies for mapping gene expression at the
single cell level within tissues; developing expertise and providing guidance in use of automated AI-driven
analysis packages (such as QuPath) for analysis of histological sections; evaluating instrumentation to
determine community benefit for fluorescent digital slide scanning; and expanding histology training offerings to
include more hands-on workshop opportunities. This shared Core is of exceptional value to the CCSG because
Koch Institute Members account for 95% of the Core services usage. Notably, the requested CCSG budget for

10833029,"Nanotechnology Materials Core: Project Summary/Abstract
One of the primary areas of focus in the Koch Institute is the development of new materials systems and
biomedical devices for cancer prevention, detection and treatment. These systems underpin development of
new approaches for biomarker detection, imaging modalities, and targeted therapies and vaccines. Center
Members are exploring a wide range of materials to achieve these goals, and employ combinatorial
development approaches to facilitate the discovery of new biomaterials and nanoformulations. State-of-the-art
capabilities for high resolution and surface imaging and chemical and physical analysis are key tools to enable
these studies. To fully characterize new materials, establish structure-property-function relationships, and
facilitate subsequent rational design, we established the Nanotechnology Materials Core in 2012. In the
previous competing renewal, the Core was approved for CCSG funding as an established Shared Resource.
This Core integrates a range of advanced technologies including a state-of-the-art cryo-electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) imaging suite, which enables high resolution analyses of soft biomaterials and cellular ultrastructure.
In the current funding period, the Core added a significant number of new capabilities and modified existing
services, including: new EM sample preparation instruments; new EM and correlative light and EM imaging
systems; new physical/chemical characterization capabilities; and upgrades to existing instruments. To best
capitalize on these acquisitions, CCSG Developmental funds were used to support two Cryo-EM Specialists.
Core service usage by Center Members has increased, from 14% at the time of the last renewal to 43% of
Center Members, who account for 79% of Core service use and include investigators from all three Research
Programs. Core staff has established cryo-EM workflows that are customized for Center Member research
needs, and we seek continued, partial funding to support and stabilize the Research Specialists’ efforts.
In the upcoming period, the Nanotechnology Materials Core will continue to offer a wide range of state-of-the-
art services to support Center Member research programs, and will evaluate emerging capabilities in the
context of Center Member needs and interests. A primary focus will be on refining new workflows to take full
advantage of newly acquired instrumentation. Other planned initiatives include: developing resources to
support advanced image processing, visualization, quantitation and machine learning, and collaborating with
other Cores to develop a monthly workshop series to support Center Members’ access to imaging technology

The senior leadership, in conjunction with internal and external advisory groups, drives planning and evaluation activities at the Koch Institute. Decisions to support the research and scientific community of the Koch Institute (KI), internal and external evaluation of the research, shared resources, administration and operating structure of the KI occurs via several processes. Internally, Senior Leadership and the KI Executive Committee perform oversight and review. Formal MIT evaluation processes include an annual report by the KI Director to the President of MIT, bi-annual review by academic visiting committees and an annual report to, and regular meetings with, the Vice President for Research. External review is provided by the KI Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), which meets annually and reviews the CCSG Programs, overall aims and progress, the administrative structure and shared resources. 
MIT evaluation of the research, shared resources, administration and operating structure of the Koch Institute occurs via several processes. Formal internal MIT evaluation processes include an annual report by the Koch Institute Director to the President of MIT and an annual report and budget meeting with the Vice President for Research. The Koch Institute is also subject to review by the Visiting Committee of the Department of Biology, which is appointed by the MIT Corporation and is made up of prominent scientists from outside of MIT and individuals from industry. The most recent Visiting Committee meeting was held in spring 2019. These evaluations are used in determining financial support and space allocations by MIT to the KI; both have increased over the last grant period, reflecting the strong reputation and status of the Koch Institute within MIT. The Koch Institute has several additional means of planning and evaluation. Principal among these are the Koch Institute Annual Retreat and bi-weekly Koch Institute CCSG Program and Faculty Meetings. The annual off-site retreats have proven to be an excellent opportunity for Koch Institute members and their laboratories to engage with each other and discuss their science, formally and informally. They are also very useful for the Koch Institute leadership to evaluate the Programs and membership as a whole; in recent years, the retreats have also been used as a mechanism to evaluate the candidacy of potential Koch Institute members. In addition, the Koch Institute members meet approximately every two weeks during the academic year to discuss scientific developments, Koch Institute business, and future directions. Strong mechanisms for ongoing review of Koch Institute Core Facilities are in place to ensure scientific needs of the Center members are met."

 Core B: Clinical recruits, assesses, and follows all participants in the Knight ADRC Cohort. It uses well-
established informant-based clinical and psychometric instruments (including the Uniform Data Set) at entry
and annually thereafter to obtain clinical, cognitive, behavioral, and neurological data to carefully characterize
each participant as to the presence or absence of dementia and, when present, its severity and etiology. The
Core has successfully functioned to serve the needs of cutting-edge research projects of the Knight ADRC and
its affiliated grants since its inception in 1985 and will continue to do so in the next 5-year funding period. The
Core's Specific Aims in the proposed funding period are:
1. Maintain an current active cohort of participants (current N=272), carefully characterized as to the presence
 or absence of symptomatic AD, to support longitudinal studies of the clinical, cognitive, and biomedical
 correlates of symptomatic AD in comparison with cognitively normal aging and to mark the transition of
 participants with preclinical AD to cognitive impairment.
2. Annually enroll and assess 40 new participants age 65y or older (50y or older for symptomatic individuals),
 to replenish attritional losses and expand the active cohort to ~350.
3. Collect data, images, and biospecimens (DNA, CSF, plasma, dermal fibroblasts, and iPSCs) from
 participants as appropriate.
4. Solicit brain autopsy from all participants.
5. Continue to engage individuals in the African American community in St. Louis to promote the inclusion of
 African Americans in research.
6. In conjunction with the Research Education Component, use Core resources to train early stage
 investigators in dementia assessment, the heterogeneity of ADRD, and clinicopathological correlations that
 explore the multifactorial nature of AD.
7. Continue to ensure the broad sharing of Knight ADRC tools, data, and biospecimens and continue
 contributions to multicenter ADRD programs.
8. Address appropriate NAPA milestones related to cognitive data, longitudinal molecular phenotyping, sex
 and racial differences, sleep, and vascular contributions to dementia."
10833118,"Core F: Biomarker Project Summary
Neurodegenerative diseases result from multifactorial processes that cause pleiotropic changes in the
molecular networks that link a host of biological processes, leading to protein aggregation in the brain, and
ultimately to the relentless decline in cognition that characterizes most age-related dementing illnesses.
Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD), idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), and
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) occur by mechanisms in which common or rare variants associated
with disease risk are directly inherited or arise sporadically. Human somatic and stem cell models have
emerged as a powerful system for modeling the complexities of pathological gene expression, particularly in
the early phase of disease, in the context of a non-neoplastic human genome. Further, human stem cells can
be differentiated into individual cell types affected in disease, such as neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and
oligodendrocytes, as well as 3D “mini-brain” organoids. To this end, we have established a biorepository of
stem cell models of AD and related dementias. The collection includes more than 200 human fibroblasts from
the Knight ADRC and the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) and induced pluripotent stem cell
(iPSC) lines from more than 30 individuals carrying mutations in APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, GRN, MAPT, and risk
variants in MAPT, APOE, TREM2, RAB10 and PLD3. Our long-term goal is to develop a set of tools and
biomarkers for AD and related dementias. To do this, we will continue to build a biorepository of human
somatic and stem cell models. These cells will facilitate the study of basic disease mechanisms, allow for
discovery of novel biomarkers, and facilitate drug discovery platforms. We will focus on cell collection that
builds on three major areas of strength in the Knight ADRC: (1) contributions of diverse ethnic backgrounds to
molecular and cellular biomarkers of AD; (2) genetic and molecular modifiers of age at onset in large families
with a dense family history of late onset AD; and (3) comparison of the molecular and cellular biomarkers that
are common and unique between autososomal dominant AD and sporadic, late onset AD. Finally, we will make
available the human somatic and stem cell lines to the broader research community to revolutionize our
understanding of AD and related dementias."

Center (Knight ADRC) is to develop a dynamic training pipeline to meet the nation's needs for a diverse clinical
translational workforce in Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD). The REC will accelerate the
career development of trainees along the training continuum by leveraging the rich research and training
resources available at Washington University and with collaborators nationally. The long-term goal of the REC
is to develop independent ADRD researchers. The Aims of the REC are to: (1) Create and evaluate a
comprehensive training program in ADRD research for trainees from diverse disciplines at Washington
University. The REC will provide training in a set of core research competencies using individual development
plans to address diversity in training and stage of career development. (2) Develop a comprehensive mentor
training and support program for junior and senior faculty in ADRD research, focused on training investigators
to mentor underrepresented minorities (URM). (3) Increase recruitment, training, and success for
underrepresented groups, women, and people with disabilities. Trainees will have access to mentored
research, didactic training, seminars, national and international meetings, residency programs with the Knight
ADRC Cores, externships, short training programs, and career development programming. They will be
integrated into Knight ADRC research teams. Mentors will receive comprehensive training, including in how to
mentor URM trainees. We will focus on recruiting and retaining URM trainees along the training continuum
through a series of outreach programs and through partnerships with strong training programs at the University
of Rochester and Meharry Medical College. Upon achieving these Aims, we will have a comprehensive
research education component that will capitalize on the rich resources of Washington University to spark
interest in and accelerate the training of diverse trainees in ADRD research."

 Cervical cancer was once the leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States (U.S.).
The implementation of comprehensive programs for screening, diagnosis, and treatment over the past 60
years has reduced cervical cancer incidence and mortality by more than 70% in the U.S. In contrast, cervical
cancer remains the 1st or 2nd leading cause of cancer death among women in many low-and middle-income
countries (LMICs). Cervical cancer prevention programs in low-resource settings are hampered by a lack of
personnel with appropriate clinical expertise, lack of pathology services, and lack of associated infrastructure.
Programs that involve multiple patient visits have a high rate of loss to follow-up. Screen-and-Treat
approaches have been implemented in LMICs and include screening by HPV testing or visual inspection with
acetic acid (VIA) followed by immediate treatment, reducing loss to follow-up; but these approaches lead to
massive over-treatment due to the poor specificity of VIA and HPV testing. There is an urgent need for
appropriate diagnostic tools to enable the implementation of a sensitive and specific Screen-Diagnose-Treat
strategy that can be performed in a single patient visit in LMICs and in medically underserved areas of the U.S.
 We propose to develop and validate a low-cost Multimodal Mobile Colposcope (MMC) for global cervical
Screen-Diagnose-Treat programs. This new device will combine the imaging capabilities of a smartphone-
based colposcope developed by MobileODT with the microscopic imaging capabilities of a fiber-optic confocal
imaging probe developed by Rice University. The MMC will image the entire cervix, automatically identify
suspicious regions, and acquire co-registered high-resolution images of nuclear morphometry from suspicious
areas. Multimodal image analysis algorithms will be developed in a study of 300 women referred for
colposcopy at two sites in Brazil. The performance of the MMC with automated image analysis for detection of
cervical precancer will be validated in a study of an additional 760 women referred for colposcopy in Brazil.
We will determine the feasibility and usability of the MMC among low-resource setting providers by carrying out
cancer prevention training courses using the MMC in Brazil.
 Our academic-industrial partnership includes expertise in bioengineering (Rice University), colposcopy and
medical imaging (MobileODT), cervical cancer prevention and treatment (MD Anderson Cancer Center), and
cervical cancer prevention and epidemiology (Albert Einstein College of Medicine), as well as the clinical
expertise of our Brazilian clinical partners: Barretos Cancer Hospital and the Federal University of Health
Sciences of Porto Alegre/Hospital Santa Casa. The innovative imaging technologies to be developed in this
proposal will enable effective single-visit Screen-Diagnose-Treat programs to diagnose and treat women with
cervical precancer while minimizing overtreatment."

Dr. Umeshkumar Athiraman MD, is a neuroscientist and neuroanesthesiologist with the long-term goal to be an
independent investigator focused on understanding the underlying mechanisms of anesthetic conditioning-
induced neurovascular protection, development of anesthetic conditioning-based therapeutics for aneurysmal
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and later application of these insights to other forms of brain injury. Dr.
Athiraman is a member of Dr. Zipfel’s lab in the Department of Neurosurgery at Washington University in Saint
Louis. The lab, department, and the university provide an exceptional training environment. Dr. Athiraman will
receive training in the Zipfel lab in SAH animal models, immunohistochemistry, molecular biology techniques
and assessment of short and long-term neurobehavioral outcomes after SAH. He will also receive training in
optical imaging for functional connectivity assessment in the lab of collaborator, Dr. Adam Bauer. Additional
support and mentorship will be provided by the applicant’s host department of anesthesiology. SAH is a severe
type of hemorrhagic stroke with extremely high morbidity and mortality. Apart from the initial hemorrhage severity,
secondary brain injury due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) plays a significant role in patient outcomes after
SAH. While many strategies to combat DCI have been developed in preclinical studies and tested in late phase
clinical trials, none have proven efficacious for improving long-term functional outcome. The causes of these
failures are likely multitude, but include use of therapies targeting only one element of what has proven to be
multifactorial brain injury process. The proposed project examines the impact of a therapy known to have
powerful, multifaceted protective effects on DCI after SAH called as – conditioning (anesthetic). Preliminary
data shows that isoflurane conditioning provides robust protection against SAH-induced DCI and that this
protection is likely mediated via inhibition of two critical molecules – NF-kB and iNOS. The planned experiments
will rigorously test the following hypothesis through targeted genetic and pharmacological interventions: 1)
Inhibition of NF-kB underlies the DCI protection afforded by isoflurane conditioning; 2) Inhibition of iNOS (a key
downstream target of NF-kB) underlies the DCI protection afforded by isoflurane conditioning; and 3) Drugs that
mimic the molecular effects of isoflurane conditioning (NF-kB inhibitor, PDTC-pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; and
iNOS inhibitor, 1400W) provide long-term protection against neurobehavioral and functional connectivity deficits
after SAH. The results of these experiments will fundamentally establish NF-kB/iNOS pathway inhibition as the
key inducer of isoflurane conditioning-induced DCI protection in SAH and identify NF-kB/iNOS inhibition as a
promising new therapeutic strategy for SAH. The proposed plan will provide Dr. Athiraman with the training,
mentorship and experience to transition to independence in a timely manner and obtain R01 funding."
10849874,"Project Summary
We propose to combine biophysical imaging and biochemical approaches to address two key unanswered
questions in the field of signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) – a principal class of therapeutic targets
in cancer where resistance to current therapies necessitates new pharmacological approaches:
 a. What defines the distinct set of responses, and cell fate, downstream of a particular RTK?
 b. How can different ligands for a given RTK promote distinct cellular responses?
It is well known that epidermal growth factor (EGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) promote proliferative and
differentiative responses respectively in PC12 cells, through EGFR and TrkA, apparently using the same set of
signaling pathways. Early studies showed that Erk activation kinetics plays a key role in determining the
different cell fates induced by these ligands, with transient Erk activation being associated with proliferation
and sustained Erk activation with differentiation. Rather than being defined solely by different feedback ‘wiring’
in the intracellular MAP kinase cascade, we and others have found that the RTK activation kinetics play a
direct role in defining the dynamic properties of the signaling network. Several recent studies further argue that
the strength of ligand-induced RTK dimers (and/or their lifetime) dictates signaling specificity, offering the
possibility of dynamically-determined biased agonism in RTK signaling.
 To gain insight into the mechanistic basis for biased agonism in RTK signaling, we propose to elucidate
how activating the same RTK intracellular region in different ways can result in dramatically different cellular
responses (proliferation vs differentiation). Our previous structural, biophysical, and biochemical data suggest
the hypothesis that signaling outcome is determined by RTK dimer stability and dynamics. Using intact and
chimeric receptors, we will test this hypothesis by asking how altering RTK dimerization kinetics influences
receptor endocytosis, post-endocytic trafficking, and dynamics of the downstream signaling network. We
combine single-molecule imaging and microscopy studies of RTK trafficking with mass spectrometry and
biochemical studies of downstream signaling networks to yield an integrated picture of this. Our primary
motivation is to investigate how modifying RTK signaling dynamics (rather than simply inhibiting RTKs) might
be used in future therapeutic approaches in cancer. Our Specific Aims address the following questions:
1 How can the same RTK intracellular region elicit orthogonal cellular responses depending on how it is
activated?
2 What are the lifetimes of ErbB4/HER4 dimers induced by different neuregulin (NRG) ligands, and what is
 the basis for their sustained signaling?
Our overall goal is to understand how dimerization dynamics can define signaling specificity, possibly through
a kinetic proofreading similar to that seen in the T-cell receptor."
10854194,"This proposal requests the purchase of a LUMICKS C-Trap instrument for a Major User group at the University
of California at Davis. The C-Trap is the only commercially available laser optical trap with combined scanning
confocal fluorescence microscopy and facile microfluidics integrated into a user-friendly dependable, engineered
instrument. Single molecule force and fluorescence spectroscopies have revolutionized cellular and molecular
biology, biochemistry, biophysics, and biomedical engineering studies to answer key biological and health-
related questions. Currently, these tools are mainly restricted to laboratories with dedicated specific expertise
and that have lab-built single molecule instruments. The C-Trap is designed as a turn-key system that allows
laboratories without single molecule force or fluorescence spectroscopy expertise to perform state-of-art single
molecule force, position, and fluorescence localization and FRET analysis at unparalleled spatial and temporal
resolution. Key features of the C-Trap include dual optical traps to manipulate biomolecules with sub pN force
resolution/detection; 3-color laser confocal fluorescence detection to visualize biological processes; accurate
temperature control; micro and nano-stage control for absolute sample positioning; laminar flow microfluidics
that enable high sample throughput and varying ambient media while maintaining molecular interactions; and
user-friendly software that integrates, controls and automates the instrument operation. Importantly, the intuitive
instrument and software interface and automation package will allow non-expert users to run experiments and
collect high-quality data after minimal training.
The proposal is being submitted on behalf of four major users (all with NIH R01 funding), who will utilize the bulk
of the instrument time, and six minor users with either NIH and/or other funding. These users come from five
different departments (Molecular and Cellular Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Pharmacology,
Cardiovascular Institute and Bioengineering) and three of the UC Davis Schools. The C-Trap will significantly
advance the NIH funded projects of these researchers by enabling high impact single molecule
mechanobiological and fluorescence studies on a range of scientifically important biomedical questions in areas
or molecular motors, cardiovascular function, cytoskeletal filaments and filament binding proteins, cell-cell
interactions, nucleic acid processing enzymes, and protein synthesis. The major users and technical advisors
have extensive relevant expertise with the technology to provide guidance to all users. UC Davis School of
Medicine and School of Biological Sciences are committing significant institutional resources (dedicated space
and operating, service, and maintenance funds) to ensure sustained and effective use. The establishment of
resource will significantly enhance numerous research programs at UC Davis and contribute to discovery of high
impact scientific, biomedical and health-care related knowledge."

resolution, sensitivity, and uniformity system with a compact footprint that will yield accurate quantitative data
and allow seamless continuation of research for our cancer center members and University researchers. An
acquisition of the Molecubes β-CUBE/X-CUBE small animal scanner meets all of these needs. This will facilitate
and enhance the scientific quality and productivity of numerous NIH-funded research projects. The research
programs that will use the new shared instrument seek to better understand cancer biology, the effects of external
beam radiation and targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) on tumor microenvironment, to combine radiation,
including TRT, with immunotherapies with the intent of affording durable curative cancer responses accompanied
with immune memory induction. The Major Users group consists of RO1, PO1, UO1, and DOD-funded
investigators, while the Minor Users group also includes U54, P01, RO1 and DOD-funded investigators who
request this instrument to achieve their specific aims. Exceptional departmental and institutional support
(providing 41% of the purchase price) and outstanding technical expertise assure that the requested equipment
will be operable immediately and highly productive at UW for many years to come."
10840890,"Project Summary
Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is a key enzyme in the methionine salvage pathway whose function
is to convert 5′-deoxy-5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA) into methionine. Inactivation of MTAP, often by
homozygous deletion, is found in both solid and hematologic malignancies and is one of the most frequently
observed genetic alterations in human cancer. Previous work from our lab and others has established that MTAP
can act as a tumor suppressor gene. However the precise mechanism by which MTAP loss promotes
tumorigenesis is still unclear. One possible mechanism involves the accumulation of MTA, which is secreted by
MTAP-deleted tumor cells. Structurally, MTA closely resembles adenosine and evidence indicates that it can
interact with adenosine receptors. Large-scale genetic screens using shRNA have established that MTAP-
deleted cells are especially sensitive to knockdown of a specific protein arginine methyltransferase enzyme
(PRMT5), which is responsible for the post-translational symmetric dimethylation modification of arginine
residues (sDMA). This modification is frequently observed in proteins involved in mRNA maturation. In
preliminary data, we demonstrate that loss of MTAP or addition of extracellular MTA causes a dramatic reduction
of the steady-state levels of sDMA-containing proteins. Significantly, when extracellular MTA is added, no
increase in intracellular MTA occurs, suggesting that the reduction in sDMA-ylation is due to a signal transduction
process. However, our data also suggests that enzymatically inactive MTAP protein itself, independent of MTA,
can affect mRNA levels and antagonize the effects of MTA. Thus the overall goal of this proposal is to explore
the hypothesis MTAP mediates its tumor suppressor function via two different mechanisms: one involving MTA
as an oncometabolite and the other a direct role for the MTAP protein. The specific aims of the study are: (1)
Identify specific proteins and arginine residues that are differentially methylated in response to MTAP; (2)
Determine the roles of intracellular and extracellular MTA in the mechanism of sDMA-lyation in cancer cells; and
(3) Clarification of the enzymatic vs. non-enzymatic functions of MTAP. These studies are significant because
they provide a potential mechanism for understanding the role that MTAP deletion plays in tumorigenesis and
may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for MTAP-deleted tumors. In addition, these studies will shed light on
how a “housekeeping” metabolic enzyme can have a novel role as a tumor suppressor gene."

Overview and Background. This is a proposal for a hybrid 2 implementation-effectiveness randomized
controlled trial (RCT) of FINISHING HIV, an implementation strategy bundle of a social network support
component and a one-stop-shop PrEP component to improve PrEP initiation of Latino men who have sex with
men (LMSM). PrEP can reduce HIV transmission by up to 99%,1 however, PrEP services are not being
sufficiently accessed by Latinos in Miami, the epicenter of the HIV epidemic in the US.2 Further, LMSM who do
not self-identify as gay have lower PrEP awareness than LMSM who self-identify as gay.3 To prepare for this
study, we have developed an innovative approach that tailors LMSM engagement based on sexual self-identity
using community-based social events and pharmacies. Preliminary work. The trial is a direct next step from
our “Ending the HIV Epidemic” (EHE) planning supplements, where we conducted the needed preliminary
study to launch this hybrid trial, and with ISCI3 support, the team jointly assessed feasibility, refined strategies
and built a logic model informed by local context needs and preferences. Over the past two years, the PI has
built partnerships with Latinos Salud (a local HIV agency for LMSM) and CVS Health. Design. We will use an
innovative network-based approach informed by the PI’s K99/R00 funded research and Social Contagion
Theory,4 which states that health behavior preferences, including PrEP initiation, are affected by opinions and
attitudes prevailing in one’s social environment, and spread through friendship networks.5 Penetration at
pharmacies and social events will lead to random assignment of the participants to either FINISHING HIV
(social network support component + one-stop-shop PrEP component; N=24 seeds and 288 LMSM friends) or
to standard health promotion (N=312). Participants will be assessed at baseline, and receive follow ups and
dried blood spots collection at 6 and 12 months to quantify tenofovir diphosphate concentrations. For
implementation (Aim 1), we will use RE-AIM framework6 to evaluate Reach (the extent to which high risk
persons initiate participation in the program), and Implementation (the extent to which implementation
strategies are delivered as designed) of FINISHING HIV. We will also use Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Science Research7 to examine contextual factors associated with Reach and Implementation
(e.g., facilitators and challenges or barriers to reach and implementation; participants reaction to these
strategies). We will compare effectiveness (Aim 2) of the strategies in PrEP initiation (primary outcome), as
well as PrEP knowledge, retention, and adherence (secondary outcomes). We will identify theory-based
moderators (e.g., recruitment at social events vs. pharmacies) and social network mediators of intervention
effects. We will also assess how friendship network structural evolutions contribute to increasing PrEP
initiation. Implications. Our use of a social network support, one-stop-shop PrEP, and community and national
pharmacy chain partners is a promising model that can be replicated in other EHE priority areas nationwide."

10861029,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Sepsis is a medical emergency of life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to
infection. In the United States, over one million people are hospitalized with sepsis or septic shock every year,
including >75,000 children. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is the most common cause of death
for children with sepsis. Although most children who develop sepsis recover with appropriate conventional
care, ~20% develop MODS, and one in five of these children with sepsis-induced MODS still die. For this
high-risk subset, we have no cure and care is largely supportive. Widespread alterations in the ability of
mitochondria to supply sufficient energy for normal cellular activities has been implicated as a key pathologic
event leading to MODS in sepsis. Using a protocol optimized to measure mitochondrial respiration and content
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), our group discovered that children with prolonged sepsis-
induced MODS are more likely to have persistent mitochondrial dysfunction. This proposal builds on our prior
work to test the hypothesis that low mitochondrial respiration in PBMCs is caused by abnormal mitochondrial
quality control processes (biogenesis, fission, fusion, and mitophagy) that normally restore and maintain
mitochondrial health. The resulting mitochondrial dysfunction, through release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
into the cytosol, can then activate inflammatory pathways that sustain inflammation and organ dysfunction in
children with sepsis. In Aim 1, we will determine which changes in mitochondrial quality control are associated
with recovery versus persistence of low mitochondrial respiration in children with sepsis. We will enroll 106
children with sepsis-induced MODS and measure mitochondrial respiration, redox state, content, biogenesis,
fission, fusion, and mitophagy on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 of illness. In Aim 2, we will determine if the persistence of
PBMC mitochondrial dysfunction activates three inflammatory pathway (cGAS-STING, TLR-9, and
inflammasome) that sense release of mtDNA into the cytosol. In Aim 3, we will test whether mitochondrial
dysfunction, abnormal mitochondrial quality control, or activation of inflammatory pathways are associated with
the severity or duration of MODS in children with sepsis. As part of Aims 1 and 2, we will also conduct a
parallel set of in vitro experiments to test the utility of lipopolysaccharide- and lipoteichoic acid-stimulation of
EBV-transformed lymphoblasts as a potential translational platform for future therapeutic investigation and to
establish cytosolic mtDNA as one mechanism through which mitochondria can promote inflammation in sepsis.
These aims address the NICHD’s interest in “studies focused on mitochondrial dysfunction as a
pathophysiologic process of MODS…with potential to advance to translational and clinical projects.” By
understanding why mitochondrial dysfunction persists in some children and how this can lead to sustained
inflammation and MODS, we will identify new potential therapeutic targets for children with prolonged MODS,
the leading cause of death in sepsis for which we currently have no cure."
10861043,"SUMMARY
During differentiation, enterocytes build an extensive apical array of microvilli known as the brush border, which
serves to amplify the plasma membrane surface area available for nutrient absorption. An individual microvillus
is simple in structure, consisting of a supporting core bundle of ~25 actin filaments that protrudes from the apical
surface wrapped in membrane. In addition to serving as the sole site of nutrient uptake, brush border microvilli
also provide an anchoring point for the glycocalyx and regulate interactions with luminal microbes. Although the
brush border serves as the primary functional interface of the intestinal tract, mechanisms that drive the timely
formation of microvilli during enterocyte differentiation remained unclear until recently. During our first funding
period, we discovered several factors that control actin filament polymerization during microvilli formation,
including the IRTKS/EPS8 complex. However, building stable microvilli also requires that actin filaments are
organized into core bundles, which exhibit flexural rigidities high enough to deform the apical surface. How
nascent enterocytes coordinate the fundamental activities of actin filament polymerization and bundling in space
and time to build stable microvilli remains unknown. In recent preliminary studies, we used a proximity labeling
approach to identify proteins within ~20 nm of IRTKS/EPS8 puncta during microvillus assembly; this screen led
to our exciting discovery of Mitotic Spindle Positioning (MISP) as a new actin filament bundling protein in the
brush border. MISP is expressed along the full crypt-villus axis, where it localizes to the apical surface. Closer
inspection with super-resolution microscopy revealed that MISP exhibits strikingly specific enrichment on core
bundle rootlets. In cultured cells, we found that MISP stabilizes and elongates rootlets, and recruits other
canonical actin bundlers to these sites. Importantly, we found that purified MISP is sufficient to organize actin
filaments into tight linear bundles in vitro. Finally, our preliminary analysis of MISP knockout mice revealed a
striking loss of rootlets and decrease in microvillar surface density. Based on our preliminary data, we propose
the following CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS: At the apical surface of differentiating enterocytes, MISP organizes actin
filaments generated by the IRTKS/EPS8 complex to form core bundles that support the protrusion of brush
border microvilli. Using a unique combination of state-of-the-art light and electron microscopy technology and
novel biological model systems, we will: (Aim 1) determine if MISP specifies sites of microvillar growth at the
apical surface, (Aim 2) define the mechanism of MISP actin binding and bundling, (Aim 3) elucidate the function
of MISP in enterocyte differentiation in vivo. We expect that completion of these Aims will lead to new paradigms
for understanding intestinal epithelial morphogenesis."

Proteins are critical to all biological processes and designed proteins have important applications in research
and medicine. This project focuses on the development and application of computational methods for protein
design. Recently, there has been tremendous progress in the use of deep learning (DL) for protein modeling.
Neural networks have been trained for structure prediction and sequence design that outperform more traditional
molecular mechanics-based models in a variety of benchmarks. The exciting challenge before the field now is
to discover how to extend these methods toward the design of the diverse functionalities and structural features
evident in naturally occurring proteins. In preliminary studies, we developed a protein design pipeline, called
EvoPro, that uses iterative rounds of DL-based structure prediction and sequence design to optimize a
population of sequences for a user-specified design goal. As an initial test, EvoPro was used to create de novo
proteins that bind to a specified surface patch on another protein. Without any affinity maturation, EvoPro
generated several proteins that bind to the target with KDs less than 150 nM. We now aim to test this pipeline on
a diverse set of protein targets, choosing cases where protein binders may be useful as biosensors or
therapeutics. Allostery is a fundamental process used throughout biology for regulating protein function, and
because of technical challenges is an understudied area in protein design. We will use EvoPro to design protein
interactions where the binding of protein A to protein B induces a conformational change in protein B. To enable
this goal, EvoPro will make use of DL models for sequence design that can optimize an amino acid sequence to
be compatible with multiple conformations. Progress in this area will enable the design of protein switches that
respond to positive and negative regulators. Explicit negative design will also be incorporated into the sequence
design models to redesign the specificity of protein-protein interactions and enable the formation of novel protein
assemblies. To improve DL models for sequence design, we are testing graph neural networks that include
explicit representations of side chain atoms during message passing. These models are being trained to
simultaneously predict side chain coordinates and optimize the protein sequence. By pursuing these projects,
we will expand the capabilities of computational protein design and create molecules that can be used to
understand or treat disease."
10844439,"Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder driven by polymicrobial infection. The pathogenesis
of this disorder involves activation, and possibly perturbation, of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Over
the course of our investigation we have demonstrated that Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), a
putative pathogen implicated in the pathogenesis of localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP), produces an
immunotoxin, the cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt). Cdt is a heterotrimeric holotoxin which functions as an AB2
toxin: the cell binding (B) units are comprised of the CdtA and CdtC subunits and the active (A) subunit, CdtB.
We have demonstrated that CdtB functions as a 5'-phosphatidylinositol (PI) triphosphate phosphatase as it
degrades the PI-3K signaling lipid, PI-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) to PI-3,4P2; this action leads to blockade of the
signaling pathway. Blockade of PI-3K signaling in human macrophages leads to a pro-inflammatory cytokine
response involving both canonical and noncanonical inflammasome activation. Cdt also induces production of
inflammatory mediators derived from arachidonic acid including PGE2 and thromboxanes. Most recently, we have
observed phagocytic defects in Cdt-treated macrophages consistent with altered phago-lysosome maturation. We
propose that Cdt perturbs macrophage function thereby contributing to both inflammation and sustained infection.
 Our overarching hypothesis is that the Aa Cdt contributes to altered local host defense which facilitate
Aa survival and enables other microbes to evade host defense. The goal of our study is to extend our investigation
and advance our knowledge of the molecular events that link PI-3K signaling blockade to downstream pro-
inflammatory responses and altered vesicular trafficking and fusion. Specifically, we propose that CdtB induces
GSK3â-dependent HSP90 activation and further that HSP90, via its effects on NLRP3, Cox-2 and possibly ESCRT
proteins is a critical intermediary in events leading to release of mature cytokines and eicosanoids (specific aim
1). We plan to advance our understanding of the role that Cdt plays activating the noncanonical inflammasome
which involve gasdermin D (GSDMD) pore formation and pyroptosis. Our focus will be to determine how CdtB
activates caspase-4 and contributes to GSDMD pore formation; the latter studies will focus on PI-3,4P2 and pore
repair via the ESCRT system (specific aim2). In specific aim 3 we will focus on perturbation of vesicular transport
and phago-lysosome formation. We propose that altered PI distribution due in part to CdtB-mediated production
of PI3,4P2 facilitates CdtB retrograde transport and modulates the formation of phago-lysosomes. The long-term
goals of our study are to translate our understanding of the molecular events that govern Cdt toxicity and, in turn,
the pathogenicity of Cdt-producing organisms. These studies are of particular significance as Cdt is produced not
only by Aa but many other pathogens that contribute to chronic infectious and inflammatory disorders. Insight
gained through this investigation will advance our understanding of the molecular events underlying LAP and other
diseases caused by Cdt-producing organisms and identify new avenues for therapeutic intervention.

10844443,"Appalachia is a socially and economically disadvantaged part of the US, and growing evidence
suggests that health disparities between Appalachia and the rest of the country are widening. Gay, bisexual,
and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) and transgender women in rural Appalachia are at increased
risk for HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). There remains a dearth of
effective approaches to address these emerging and intersecting epidemics among GBMSM and
transgender women living in rural settings in the US.
 In Aim 1, our community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership proposes to systematically
integrate two evidenced-based strategies (i.e., peer navigation and mHealth) into a comprehensive culturally
congruent, bilingual intervention to increase the use of needed HIV, STI, and HCV prevention and care
services among racially/ethnically diverse GBMSM and transgender women in rural Appalachia. In Aim 2, we
will implement and test the intervention through a longitudinal group-randomized design using behavioral
assessment and in-depth interview data collected at: (1) baseline, (2) immediate post intervention, and (3) 12-
month follow-up. Our hypotheses are that participants in the intervention group, relative to their counterparts in
the delayed-intervention group, will demonstrate (1) increased HIV, STI, and HCV testing and (2) increased
use of needed prevention services (PrEP and syringe services) and care services (HIV care, STI and HCV
treatment, and gender-affirming care). In Aim 3, we will develop and disseminate practice, research,
intervention, and policy priorities and recommendations to reduce health disparities in rural Appalachia by
conducting an empowerment theory-based community forum.
 This CBPR study will advance prevention science and practice through testing an innovative
intervention to promote and support the use of needed HIV, STI, and HCV prevention and care services
among GBMSM and transgender women; and developing priorities and recommendations to improve their
health that will be disseminated to inform public health practice, research, and policy. By integrating peer
navigation and mHealth strategies, the proposed study provides a unique opportunity to improve health among
vulnerable, hidden, and neglected populations living in rural Appalachia. Findings from this research may
inform strategies and approaches to address other health disparities in other rural populations."

The broad, long term objective of this award is to facilitate independence as a nurse scientist, generate
preliminary evidence and facilitate an R01 application. The overarching goal of this study is to compare vascular
function, cardiac structure and function and lipid biomarker/fibrosis proteomics between each adverse pregnancy
group to gain insight into mechanisms leading to adverse outcomes and provide opportunities for intervention.
The proposed study, “Is Preeclampsia and Spontaneous Preterm Delivery Associated with Vascular and
Cardiac Dysfunction?” is a longitudinal, comparative design study, were I will compare 4 groups; 1) women
who experience term preeclampsia (≥37 weeks); 2) spontaneous preterm delivery (sPTD) (≤ 34 weeks) and; 3)
preterm preeclampsia (PreE) (<37 weeks) compared to women who experience 4) full-term deliveries (≥39
weeks) at 3-time points (24-72 hours, 1 and 2 years postpartum). My long-term goals are to: (1) employ
comprehensive mechanistic phenotyping and utilizing cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) techniques
to refine the current understanding of mechanisms linking adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) and
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk; (2) translate scientific advances across cardiovascular,
nursing science, proteomics and women’s health research in order to elucidate how we further phenotype APOs
(3) enhance our ability to identify individuals at risk for future ASCVD early in the course of ASCVD, before the
onset of clinical disease; (4) ultimately change ASCVD disease course for women who are at increased risk (5)
lead a multidisciplinary team of translational investigators focused on the research.
The following key variables related to future risk of cardiovascular disease will be evaluated: vascular function
(augmentation index and pulse wave velocity) and cardiac structure and function measured by cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging utilizing Cine, Tissue Tagging (left ventricular systolic and diastolic function
including strain), T1 mapping (fibrosis), at 1 and 2 years postpartum.) Secondary measures include novel
cardiac biomarkers including a lipid biomarker collection for 72 proteins and lipids, proteomics fibrosis panel
[(Matric metalloproteinases (MMPs) and Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGF-""β1). Ultimately, the outcome of
this research will inform relationships between TPre, sPTD and PreE which is an important step to uncover the
link between APOs and future maternal ASCVD risk. This effort will shape the development of specific treatment
targets for new opportunities in chronic ASCVD prevention. Achieved training goals will augment and facilitate
independence, generate preliminary evidence and facilitate an R01 application."

The current proposal seeks to clarify the mechanisms underlying suicide death. Suicide constitutes a severe
and steadily worsening public health crisis, and suicide prevention has become a primary focus of NIMH
efforts. Aggregated data across multiple large genetic studies yield heritability estimates of suicide death at
approximately 45%. However, research on risk factors to date has been largely confined to epidemiological
observations, with a lack of access to molecular genetic data on suicide death. This lack of access has
resulted in an overwhelming focus on the genetic study of subthreshold phenotypes—ideation and attempt—
which very rarely result in suicide. Currently, positive predictive values for suicide attempt are high (.9), while
positive predictive values for suicide death continue to hover near zero. This research team has
unprecedented access to DNA from thousands of independent, population-based suicide deaths from the Utah
Office of the Medical Examiner. DNA resources are enhanced by a wealth of electronic medical record and
environmental exposure data on all suicides, using the Utah Population Database, a unique resource of >10
million residents. Due to the extreme and unambiguous nature of suicide relative to psychiatric phenotypes,
genotyping and genome-wide association analysis of the first 3,413 cases and 14,848 matched controls has
already resulted in genome-wide significant signals and strong polygenic signal. Five novel, rare missense
SNPs are also significantly associated with suicide death in these preliminary data. By genotyping additional
and incoming suicide deaths, this project aims to replicate and significantly expand on genetic discoveries. In
addition, approximately 20% of the population-based suicides evidence significant ancestry admixture,
providing valuable diversity to enhance both discovery and generalizability. This research team will work
closely in partnership with the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and UK Biobank to examine new data on
suicide death, test clinically informative risk models, and leverage large external cohorts to model complex
suicide etiologies. Some of the high-impact deliverables from this project include a) comprehensive co-
morbidity, mode of death, and risk factor statistics from the largest population-based suicide cohort to date, b)
the first genome-wide data and summary statistics for suicide death, linked to a wealth of risk phenotypes,
polygenic risks, and diagnoses (e.g., ADHD, affective disorders, alcohol use disorder, autism spectrum
disorder, pain, mania, metabolic conditions, opiate use, pregnancy, psychosis), c) genetic correlation estimates
of suicide death with a range of phenotypes, for the development of genetic risk models, and d) clinically
informative genetic and environmental predictors of suicide, accounting for sex, ancestry, and age."
10844552,"Matricellular proteins are constituents of the extracellular matrix (ECM). They are normally expressed highly
during embryonic development but absent/low in adult tissues unless activated by cues for tissue remodeling.
Matricellular proteins shape ECM properties through interactions with structural proteins, growth factors, and cell
receptors during organ development and differentiation. In an attempt to identify molecular signatures unique to
irreversible cardiac fibrosis, we performed proteomics of fibrotic heart and liver and found that cartilage
intermediate layer protein 1 (Cilp1) is differentially upregulated in the infarcted heart. Cilp1 is normally associated
with bone and cartilage development. Its function and mechanism of action in adult heart diseases are unknown.
We generated Cilp1 knockout (KO) mice from commercial Cilp1fl/fl mice and transgenic (Tg) mice with Cilp1
overexpressed in myofibroblasts. While deletion of Cilp1 reduced adverse cardiac remodeling upon myocardial
infarction (MI), overexpression of Cilp1 worsened it. Cilp1 is expressed predominantly in cardiac fibroblasts. We
hypothesize that fibroblast Cilp1 promotes inflammation and myofibroblast proliferation upon MI injury. We now
generated fibroblast conditional fbKO mice (PostnMCM;Cilp1fl/fl and Tcf21MCM;Cilp1fl/fl that contain a tamoxifen
inducible Cre-recombinase expression cassette within Periostin (Postn) and Tcf21 genetic locus, respectively).
Aim 1. To determine the cell-type specific function of Cilp1 in post-MI cardiac remodeling. We will delete Cilp1
in cardiac fibroblasts before and post-MI day (d) 1 & d4 to investigate its effect on cardiac remodeling, including
cardiac function, inflammation, myofibroblast proliferation/differentiation, and collagen remodeling. We will also
perform proteomics of myofibroblasts isolated from these mouse hearts. The role of fibroblast Cilp1 in regulation
of gene transcription in various heart cell types will be investigated with single-nuclei RNA-seq of infarcted WT
and Cilp1 fbKO hearts at post-MI d3. Aim 2. To establish the molecular function of Cilp1 and its mechanism of
action. Preliminary studies showed that Cilp1 protein in culture medium promotes myofibroblast proliferation via
the mTORC1 pathway and binds scavenge receptor CD36. Cilp1 may interact with cell receptor/growth factor,
promoting cell proliferation and inflammatory gene expression via receptor-mediated signaling pathways. To test
this hypothesis, we will identify the minimal functional domain(s) of Cilp1 via mutagenesis and potential Cilp1-
binding partners using both screen- and candidate-based assays and will establish how Cilp1 may act as a
paracrine factor to regulate the cellular phenotypes of various heart cell types via receptor-mediated signaling
pathways. We will also measure blood level of Cilp1 in mice before and after an anti-fibrogenic therapy upon MI
injury. Matricellular proteins are clinically tractable owing to their accessibility to systemically delivered
therapeutic reagents. Our preliminary studies established a pathological role of Cilp1 in post-MI remodeling. This
proposal will establish how Cilp1 instructs development and differentiation of heart cells and gene expression to
promote adverse remodeling, thus providing mechanistic insight on how to target this protein."

In the United States, food destined for pet consumption usually is safe for both the pets and the people who
handle the food. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its spread are crucial issues. Understanding improving
AMR detection and its spread is an essential issue. The ability to be ready to respond to old new pathogens is
paramount. It is clear from the current pandemic, where SARS-CoV-2 has sicked and killed millions of people
worldwide. It also has sickened pets, many species held in zoo collections, and seems to have found a
reservoir in deer. The extent of the problem is still not fully recognized.
The University of Georgia (UGA) is committed to promoting, training, and conducting research in all areas of
animal, human and environmental health. The College of Veterinary Medicine and the State Veterinary
Diagnostic Laboratory (AVDL) have a duty to the state and its constituents to diagnose, monitor trends, and
report unusual disease presentations or patterns. The AVDL laboratory is supported by our institution obtained
CLIA accreditation in 2020 and started performing human COVID19 PCR testing in August of that year to help
the UGA community continue its teaching, research, and service missions. Moreover, the PI implemented
saliva testing in January 2021 to improve sample collection and surveillance participation. We have processed
over 80,000 human samples, and testing continues today. Our service to the veterinary community did not
waver during this time. In addition to the regular veterinary diagnostic service, the molecular section also tested
and found pets and zoo species sickened by SARS-CoV-2.
Our laboratory has expertise in pathology, bacteriology, parasitology, virology, serology, and molecular biology,
including high throughput platform testing as demonstrated with COVID19 testing. Our faculty and staff are
highly qualified and are devoted to animal and public health. Our commitment is evident in our participation in
many programs at the state and national levels. We are one of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network
(NAHLN) and participate in all NAHLN surveillance and antimicrobial resistance testing and sequencing. In
addition, we have participated in other cooperative agreements with the FDA assessing the presence of
Salmonella in turkey-based pet treats and engaging in an epidemiological study looking at the prevalence of
Salmonella in dog and cat feces and the potential risk factors for Salmonella carriage. We are also an FDA
bacterial isolate source laboratory for their antimicrobial continued resistance testing project.
Furthermore, we are currently in the last year of our second competitive renewal of this infrastructure grant, for
which hereby we are seeking renewal. We have been very responsive to all the requirements of this grant to
date. Therefore, Athens Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and the PI in this application are uniquely
positioned to assist the FDA in meeting the critical goals of the project described in this competitive
renewal."
10844281,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The University of Iowa Flow Cytometry Facility was established in 1979 and currently serves 128 principal
investigators spanning 31 departments across four colleges. This group continuously receives NIH support for
their work on diverse biomedical research projects that advance our understanding of biological processes that
are essential for human health and identify novel methods to detect and treat a wide variety of diseases.
Recent advances in flow cytometry, microscopy, and single-cell sequencing have increasingly enabled
researchers to identify specific cell populations. Consequently, our investigators require cutting-edge
instrumentation that can accommodate a wide range of experimental conditions to address new research
questions that arise due to these expanding technologies. Currently, our Facility operates six heavily used
benchtop flow cytometers. However, the Facility lacks an imaging cytometer, which harnesses the high
throughput, statistically robust data acquisition of a flow cytometer with the imaging and morphological
capabilities of microscopy. In the absence of this, investigators must run samples on a flow cytometer to
generate quantitative data and use the rest of their sample, or a duplicate of their sample, to generate
qualitative images on a microscope. This workflow is incompatible with rare cell populations, limits the rigor
and reproducibility of experiments due to different labeling schemes, and is costly and time consuming. The
nearest publicly accessible imaging cytometer is over 200 miles away. This lack of accessibility to an imaging
cytometer has a significant adverse impact on the ability of our investigators to obtain detailed images and
corresponding robust statistical data to assess a wide range of biological questions. Thus, there is an urgent
need to acquire an imaging cytometer in the Flow Cytometry Facility at the University of Iowa so investigators
can expand their capacity to understand cell morphology, identify subcellular localization, assess protein-
protein interactions, and distinguish specific cell staining from background in rare cell populations in a
quantitative manner, which will enable them to advance their research in new directions.
This proposal requests funds for a Cytek Amnis ImageStreamX MkII imaging cytometer to provide NIH-funded
investigators and other researchers at the University of Iowa with access to an instrument that can generate
both qualitative and quantitative data, thus reducing the time needed for data acquisition, sample degradation,
and sample-to-sample variation in the case where different samples are run using flow cytometry vs
microscopy. This will allow for continued support and enhancement of research projects carried out at the
University of Iowa and in the state of Iowa, many of which are part of clinical trials or crucial pre-clinical or
basic science studies, and will ensure the Facility continues to meet its overall goal of providing state-of-the-art
instrumentation that supports biomedical research to improve our understanding of human health and disease."

The graying global population makes interventions to extend healthy lifespan a public heath priority. Health
insults during the perinatal period are linked with risk for aging-related health conditions, including obesity, type
2 diabetes, and cardio-metabolic disease. If these associations are causal, interventions to prevent perinatal
insults and to reverse their biological damage could delay disease onset and prolong healthspan. However,
establishing causal long-term health effects of perinatal insults in humans is challenging. Randomized trials
would be unethical. Observational studies can be biased by confounding factors that erroneously suggest a
link between insults in the perinatal period and later health. In contrast, natural experiments can isolate the
impact of perinatal insults on adult disease and healthspan. The Dutch Hunger Winter Families Study
(DHWFS) uses a sudden, war-induced famine as a natural experiment. The famine was caused by a Nazi
blockade during WWII in 1944-45. Because the impact of famine was immediate, transient, and population-
wide, DHWFS comparison of infants born during the famine with those born before or after the famine will
identify potential long-term effects of perinatal-insults. However, famine natural-experiment studies, including
DHWFS, may be vulnerable to selection bias. Birth rates decline significantly during famine; famine’s impact on
fertility and fetal/infant survival might bias famine studies of perinatal insult’s long-term effects in unknown
ways. To fill this gap in knowledge, we will genotype stored DHWFS biospecimens from of N=956 individuals,
37% of whom were exposed to famine in-utero and the remainder of whom are siblings of the famine-exposed
individuals and “time controls” born immediately before or after the famine. We will link new genetic data with
participants’ existing clinical and cognitive tests and blood DNA methylation data. We will examine in this
integrative multi-omics database the potential impact of selective fertility and fetal/infant survival during the
famine on (i) genome wide genetic characteristics; (ii) differences in polygenic risk scores for specific aging-
related health conditions; and (iii) differences in methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) genotypes. We will
then conduct genetics-informed analysis of famine effects on obesity, type-2 diabetes, cognitive reserve, and
epigenetic aging. Using these new resources, we will prepare an integrated multi-omics database of the
DHWFS population for use by outside research teams and generate a one of a kind resource for famine and
perinatal insult research. The proposed project will generate a new knowledge base to further examine
biological pathways that are likely to connect perinatal events to adult health and aging through genetic and
epigenetic mechanisms."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects millions worldwide. Research in transgenic SCD mice
has shown that SCD is characterized by the overexpression of adhesion molecules (hyperadhesion) on the
endothelium and blood cells. Hyperadhesion causes vascular occlusion, which in turn leads to the hallmark acute
pain episodes of SCD named vaso-occlusive crises (VOC). Key players in hyperadhesion and VOC are the
adhesion molecules P-selectin, that tethers reticulocytes and neutrophils to the endothelium, and Very Late
Antigen-4 (VLA-4), that is responsible for firm adhesion downstream of P-selectin. The central challenge in the
clinical management of SCD is that there exist no biomarkers nor direct visualization of hyperadhesion in
humans. The knowledge deficit on hyperadhesion is consequential, as new drugs targeting adhesion molecules
to prevent VOC are being developed, yet there are no biomarkers to guide their use. Specifically, SCD care
providers cannot adopt a precision medicine approach to select which patients will respond to the P-selectin
blocker crizanlizumab, which is only efficacious in ~50% of patients, carries a high cost, and may cause severe
adverse reactions. This proposal aims to advance the field by developing the first-ever biomarker to image
hyperadhesion in humans with SCD by imaging activated VLA-4. We hypothesize that positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging of VLA-4 will measure hyperadhesion before treatment, and its decrease in response
to anti-hyperadhesive drugs. Our multidisciplinary team has developed the PET tracer 64Cu-CB-TE1A1P-PEG4-
LLP2A (64Cu-LLP2A) that binds to activated VLA-4. We found that LLP2A can detect VLA-4-mediated
hyperadhesion in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in SCD mice, and that hyperadhesion is reduced by
treatment with anti-P-selectin mAb (analogous to crizanlizumab). We now propose to i) elucidate the role of
additional triggers of hyperadhesion (i.e. hemin and hypoxia) in mice, to more thoroughly model human pathology
(Aim 1); ii) to compare 64Cu-LLP2A uptake in mice after P-selectin blockade vs. voxelotor, a new FDA-approved
drug for SCD that targets hemolysis and may impact hyperadhesion indirectly (Aim 2); and iii) to image patients
with SCD using 64Cu-LLP2A, for which we were granted regulatory approval in 2020, before and after treatment
with crizanlizumab (Aim 3). Our studies, if successful, will pave the way for biomarker-driven precision medicine
and future research for this underserved group of patients. Future clinical trials of anti-VOC treatments may
incorporate 64Cu-LLP2A to predict, quantify, and monitor response."
10846668,"Cognitive flexibility is a core component of executive functioning that is impaired in a range of neuropsychiatric
disorders. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) supports cognitive flexibility in the adult, and alterations in prefrontal
function likely contribute to impairments in this cognitive process. Cognitive flexibility, like other aspects of
executive functioning, develops slowly across postnatal development. Developmental refinement of prefrontal
circuitry and function is theorized to underlie the protracted acquisition of cognitive abilities, and abnormalities in
this refinement may contribute to deficits in prefrontal circuitry and function in the context of psychiatric disorders.
While the early stages of prefrontal circuit development are largely governed by genetic programs, subsequent
circuit refinement is heavily dependent on activity. Postnatal maturation of GABAergic tone is poised to
powerfully regulate cortical activity—providing a source of excitability during the first postnatal week that rapidly
changes to inhibition thereafter. Importantly, developmental dysfunction of interneurons, especially those
expressing parvalbumin (PV) or somatostatin (SST), is linked with impaired set-shifting behavior and prefrontal
circuit function in adulthood. Yet, how activity in PV and SST interneurons influences prefrontal
circuit development—including the development of the interneurons themselves—during different developmental
time windows is a fundamental gap in our knowledge. Further, once mature connectivity is established, how SST
and PV interneurons work together to engage cortical activity to support cognitive flexibility in adulthood, remains
unknown.
We hypothesize that during early postnatal development, prefrontal SST activity is required for establishing
increasing thalamocortical drive onto PV cells that, in turn, sustains and augments the strength of the connections
these PV cells make onto pyramidal cells, and that PV activity subsequently iteratively refines the strength of
incoming excitatory drive from cortical and subcortical sources. This developmental maturation in activity
establishes proper connectivity of PV and SST interneurons in adulthood, whose activity is essential for mature
prefrontal network function supporting cognitive flexibility. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will examine how
PV and SST interneurons organize PFC network activity to support extra dimensional attentional set shifting in
adult mice. In Aim 2, we will test how inhibiting activity of prefrontal PV or SST interneurons during different
developmental windows using the DREADD receptor, hM4DGi, affects adult network function and behavior using
the physiological and behavioral outcomes assessed in Aim 1. Understanding how PV and SST interneurons
support cognition, and how developmental perturbations of these cells affect adult PFC function, will provide
insight into neurobiological origins of cognitive deficits in psychiatric disorders and more broadly into the role of
cell-type selective GABA release in sculpting the developing PFC."

Human organoids are miniaturized model systems of organs produced by three-dimensional (3D) cultures of
tissue-resident-adult stem cells (ASCs) or pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in vitro. They have emerged as a
promising platform for modeling tissue development and disease, personalized medicine development, drug
screening and drug toxicity investigations. Despite their great potential, current human organoids suffer from
immature structure and functionality, limited heterogeneity, as well as limited accessible readouts for organoid
evaluation. For example, detailed investigations of these 3D biosystems, such as 3D electrophysiological
mapping for brain and heart organoids, cannot be achieved using conventional approaches such as two-
dimensional (2D) multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) for modulation and multimodal sensing. Furthermore, most
current biosystems lack stable and mature vascularization that exists in vivo, which poses challenges to
controlled delivery of oxygen, nutrition, and molecules like neural patterning factors to enhance organoid size,
lifespan, and complexity. Our goal is to develop a soft electronic/microfluidic hybrid 3D network for online
monitoring, regulation, and vascularization of human organoids. The resulting system will integrate separately
addressable electrical, optical, electrochemical, and thermal sensors and stimulators of designated locations
with 3D biomimetic microvascular networks for simultaneous sensing, stimulation, and well-controlled delivery
of molecules into deep tissues to study tissue development and modulation. We will achieve this goal through
pursuing three specific aims: (1) Develop multifunctional 3D electronic networks with high spatiotemporal
resolution for online monitoring and regulation of organoid function, (2) Develop biomimetic 3D microvascular
networks for the vascularization of 3D tissues and integrate them with 3D electronic networks into a hybrid
system, and (3) Evaluate the efficiency and functional robustness of the integrated system in vitro using brain
organoids as an example. Our proposed multifunctional hybrid system incorporates the following notable
innovative features: 1) Soft, stretchable 3D networks for electrical, optical, electrochemical, and thermal sensing
and stimulation of human organoids, 2) Biomimetic 3D microvascular networks for the vascularization of human
organoids, 3) Fully integrated electronics and microfluidics networks as a micro-lab for investigating various
induced and natural behaviors of human organoids. This work will create a new route to study neurodevelopment
and neurological disorders through simultaneous monitoring, regulation, and vascularization of brain organoids
throughout their 3D interior, which is of broad potential interest to the neuroscience community. In addition, the
developed 3D hybrid system can be applied to other types of organoids, including heart, lung, and kidney for in
vitro studies of related diseases."

The overall objective of this research program is to understand the molecular mechanisms of intracellular calcium
signals that regulate multiple diverse cellular functions, both healthy and pathological. Many of these signals are
due to opening of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), the most widely expressed ligand-gated Ca2+
channels. IP3Rs reside primarily in the membranes of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from which they release Ca2+
when they bind both IP3 and Ca2+.The proposed studies focus on uncovering the structural and mechanistic
basis for ligand binding, ion permeation and gating in the family of IP3R channels. IP3Rs work as Ca2+ signaling
hubs through which diverse extracellular stimuli and intracellular inputs are processed and then integrated to
result in delivery of Ca2+ from the ER lumen to generate cytosolic Ca2+ signals with precise temporal and spatial
properties. However, an in-depth understanding of the comprehensive allosteric mechanism governing control
of intracellular Ca2+ signals via IP3R channels is still lacking. Our structural and functional studies accomplished
over the last years, establish the molecular architecture of neuronal IP3R subtype 1 (IP3R1) channel providing
critical insights into channel gating and ligand-binding. Recent advances in our work coupled to our knowledge
and expertise over two decades of research on calcium channels, guide our current research strategy. In this
proposal, we seek to address the fundamental questions of how ligands and modulatory proteins affect the
conformational landscape of IP3R, and how conformational changes in channel structure control and shape its
function. We are pursuing a multidisciplinary approach that includes biochemical, biophysical, mutagenesis,
electrophysiological, cryo-EM and cryo-ET studies to dissect structure-function of IP3Rs. We will use a deep
learning neural network-based method to extract conformational motions of the IP3R domains directly from cryo-
EM images. Continuing with IP3R1, we will elucidate the molecular and structural mechanism for channel gating
and regulation at atomic level detail and define its subcellular organization and dynamics. Another effort will be
directed at defining the structural basis for isoform-specific properties of IP3Rs. To this end, we will determine
high-resolution structures of other IP3R subtypes in multiple functional states. Our structural findings will be
validated by extensive functional analysis. We aim to elucidate the mechanisms of how IP3Rs sense multiple
cellular signals and decode them into cytosolic Ca2+ signals to ensure appropriate regulation of downstream
signaling pathways. The proposed studies will provide a structural framework and the mechanistic knowledge
required for the development of new ways to control IP3R function."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that there are approximately 6.1 million infertile
couples with a female spouse aged 15-44 in the U.S., which is about 6.7% of the domestic married couple
population base for that age group. Miscarriage before 20 weeks also occurs in about 15% of known
pregnancies, and over 75% of failed pregnancies involve implantation defects. To solve these problems, we
must understand the mechanisms of uterine receptivity and implantation to develop better treatments that may
be currently out of reach. The endometrium's epithelial and stromal compartments undergo dynamic molecular
and morphological changes to prepare for implantation and development. Endometrial P4 resistance implies a
decreased responsiveness of target tissue to bioavailable P4, and such an impaired P4 response is seen in the
endometrium of women with non-receptive endometrium. However, exactly how P4 signaling becomes
defective in a non-receptive endometrium is still unclear. MIG-6 acts as a key P4 signaling mediator to inhibit
E2-mediated epithelial proliferation in the endometrium of the human and mouse. We hypothesize that Mig-6
loss causes endometrial P4 resistance by ErbB2 overexpression in the endometrium and by dysregulating P4
signaling in endometrial stromal cells. In this proposal, our objective is to determine how MIG-6 functions in the
uterus and how it is dysregulated in endometrial P4 resistance and infertility. Our Specific Aims are directed at
understanding: 1) the pathophysiological role of MIG-6 loss in implantation failure; and 2) the effect of Erbb2
ablation on female infertility with Mig-6 deficiency. Using our mouse models and biomedical imaging
techniques, we will determine the role of Mig-6 loss in implantation failure and test Erbb2 targeting to treat
endometrial P4 resistance and restore implantation. Our results will enhance our understanding of reproductive
pathophysiology as well as enable the development of more effective strategies for the diagnosis and
treatment of infertility."

Applying CAR T cell therapy to solid tumors such as ovarian cancer (OvCa) is widely considered a major
opportunity but also a major challenge and thus the focus of this proposal. Here, we seek to develop new
clinical strategies for OvCa and other solid tumors using CAR T cells specific for folate receptor-alpha (FRα),
as the target of next generation CAR T cell therapy. FRα is a surface protein that is expressed in 80-90% of
OvCa cases and associated with poor prognosis. FRα is known to be a safe, “druggable” therapeutic target in
trials of antibody drug conjugates and bispecific antibody armed T cells in platinum-resistant OvCa patients,
with clinical response rates of 26% and 27%, respectively. These agents are short-lived in patients and thus
responses are non-enduring; CAR T cells however have the capacity for persistence and maintained activity in
vivo. In multiple preclinical models, human FRα CAR T cells exhibit potent anti-tumor efficacy against human
solid tumor xenografts that express FRα. Here, we propose to test the central hypothesis that lentivirus
engineered FRα-specific CAR T cells can achieve clinically meaningful tumor responses in patients with
recurrent OvCa without untoward toxicity. We propose to (1) determine the feasibility, safety and tumor
response following intraperitoneal injection of autologous FRα lentivirus CAR T cells in patients with confirmed
FRα-overexpressing recurrent OvCa in a phase I dose escalation trial (NCT03585764), (2) determine FRα
CAR persistence, immunological potency and mechanism of FRα-specific CAR T cell activity in treated
patients to understand the immune reaction and other modulations in the OvCa microenvironment following
CAR T cell injection, and (3) determine the scope, breadth, and duration of induced systemic immune
responses, as a foundation for anticipated future combinatorial therapies. In this line, a secondary hypothesis
is that schedule-dependent preconditioning of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a requirement for effective
therapy. In OvCa and other cancers, tumor associated macrophage (TAM) accumulation is associated with
poor outcome and resistance to immunotherapy, suggesting that TAM depletion or disruption may improve
patient outcome. We have now developed novel CAR T cell technology that mediates deep and highly
selective depletion of immunosuppressive M2-like TAMs. In preclinical studies, we find that anti-TAM CAR T
cells augment endogenous CD8+ T cell antitumor responses, spares M1-like macrophages, re-educates the
TME, and inhibits tumor progression in vivo in three independent mouse tumor models, suggesting that
synergy with FRα CAR T cell therapy may be achieved, particularly when applied as a preparative
preconditioning regimen. We are positioned to test this novel hypothesis by evaluating and optimizing this
novel TAM depletion regimen, and other established approaches, in the context of FRα CAR T cells therapy in
various preclinical tumor models, allowing us to capitalize on the discovery of a novel effective combination as
a bridge to next generation clinical trials for patients with OvCa and solid tumors bearing TAM accumulation."

The goal of our project is to understand the structural features guiding the initial stages of pre-mRNA splice site
recognition, which are critical for accurate pre-mRNA splicing and frequently dysregulated in human diseases.
We focus on the U2AF, SF1 and SF3B1 splicing factors directing the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U2
snRNP) to the 3´ splice sites of pre-mRNAs. The U2AF subunits, U2AF2 and U2AF1, recognize the
polypyrimidine and AG-dinucleotide splice site signals. A third subunit, SF1 initially associates with the branch
point sequence of the pre-mRNA then is displaced by the SF3B1 subunit of the U2 snRNP. Dynamic
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of SF3B1 is required for formation of the active spliceosome. Previously,
we made progress towards understanding the molecular underpinnings of the initial steps of 3´ splice site
selection. Using X-ray crystallography, biophysical techniques, and functional assays for pre-mRNA splicing in
human cells, we have shown that representative cancer-associated mutations at the U2AF2 – RNA interface
disrupt RNA binding and splicing. We have deciphered structural details showing how U2AF2 accommodates
diverse nucleotides of splice site signals. By complementary single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer
approaches, we further revealed that the U2AF2 conformation changes in response to different splice site
sequences as well as the U2AF1 subunit and its recurrent cancer-associated mutation. We have established
important, functional interfaces of U2AF2 with SF1 and SF3B1 during pre-mRNA splicing in human cells and
discovered that phosphorylation strongly reduces SF3B1 binding to U2AF2. However, these provocative results
raise new questions. First, what are the effects of recurrent U2AF2 mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders
compared to those in cancers? Second, how is dynamic SF3B1 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
temporally regulated with U2AF2 dissociation prior to splicing? Third, how are the U2AF2, U2AF1, and SF1
subunits arranged to accurately recognize the splice site signals and ensure the fidelity of splicing? We address
these questions in the aims of this proposal by leveraging structural approaches (including X-ray crystallography,
cryoelectron microscopy, calorimetry, and fluorescence) and complementary functional assays (including co-
immunoprecipitations, pre-mRNA splicing assays, and transcriptome-wide sequencing). Altogether, the results
of these aims contribute to understanding the structural and functional underpinnings of 3´ splice site recognition
and its dysregulation in human disease."

This renewal application requests funding for the Brown School’s Training Program in Mental Health Services
Research at Washington University in St. Louis (Wash U). Our program will prepare 2 pre- and 2 post-doctoral
trainees per year to acquire advanced mental health services research skills to address challenges faced by
the most vulnerable populations in our nation. Specifically, persons living with mental disorders who seek care
at the intersection of multiple services sectors, experience high needs for care, and are the least likely to
secure needed services or to obtain high quality care. Our training program includes five knowledge domains:
mental health services research, research with vulnerable populations, intervention research, implementation
science, and advanced research methods (e.g., systems science, mixed methods). A team of 30 highly
talented mentors led by Dr. Leopoldo J. Cabassa, Associate Professor at the Brown School, supports our
training program. Our faculty are drawn from 4 Schools and 6 Departments across Wash U. They have a
distinguished record of accomplishment in mentoring and active NIH-funded research in the critical knowledge
domains of our program. An exceptional transdisciplinary training environment including 17 research centers at
the Brown School, the Institute of Public Health, and the Institute for Clinical and Translational Science
supports our program.
Building on our 25-year history of successfully training mental health services researchers, our program
continues to innovate with the following enhancements. We strengthened our methodological training by
adding new courses and faculty mentors conducting cutting-edge research in systems science, health
disparities research, implementation science, and advanced data analytics. We added a Steering Committee
(SC) composed of leaders in health and mental health services research from inside and outside Wash U and
new training opportunities for our faculty to enhance their mentoring skills. We enhanced trainees’ scientific
networking by requiring a learning site visit to existing NIMH-funded mental health services studies across the
U.S. We added workshops to improve trainees’ science communication skills to better disseminate their work
to a broader audience. The overall mission of our program is for our trainees to acquire mental health services
research knowledge and skills to meet the most pressing needs in the field of social work and to advance the
public health significance and impact of NIMH-services research."
10828427,"This T32 training program with 4 post-doctoral trainees/year has been funded by NIAID since 1994
and takes advantage of the combined extensive allergy research activities in the La Jolla scientific
community. The faculty members are from two neighboring institutes: University of California, San
Diego (UCSD), and the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology (LJI) both located on the
UCSD campus and both UCSD faculty. The program is open to MD's and Ph.D.'s interested in
allergic/immunologic disease-oriented research and committed to a career in basic research applied
to these clinical diseases. The trainees have opportunities to be exposed to a wide range of allergy
research topics. In addition, the inter-institutional training program serves as a catalyst for
promoting interactions and collaborations among researchers from different institutes. All 23 faculty
members have well established NIH funded research programs; their research backgrounds are
diverse and when taken together encompass allergy, immunology, biochemistry, cell biology,
molecular biology, bioinformatics, genetics, epigenetics, and the microbiome. Therefore, this
training program represents an interdisciplinary approach. The trainees can be involved in the
following research areas: 1) genetics and epigenetics, 2) biology of inflammatory cells, including
mast cells, and eosinophils; 3) T cells; 4) dendritic cells, 5) innate immune responses (TLRs, ILC2,
NK cells) 6) cell receptors critically involved in allergic reactions; 7) signal transduction; 8)
inflammatory mediators/cytokines; 9) functions of epithelial cells; 10) complement, and 11)
endothelial adhesion. The goals of the program are 1) to foster the development of trainee's
laboratory based investigative skills, in particular, applying molecular and cellular biological
approaches to study mechanisms of allergic diseases, and 2) to mentor trainees to successfully
compete for either independent research grants and faculty positions, or research positions in
biotechnology. The trainees are expected to devote over 90% effort to research, and training will be
supplemented by conferences, seminars, journal clubs and courses. Upon completion of the
program trainees will have developed a solid background in the molecular and cellular mechanisms
of allergic inflammation and become qualified and confident in embarking upon their careers as
independent investigators in allergy research."

AD is an age-related progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of Americans without effective
interventions. The gradual accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles formed by abnormal protein aggregation, such
as tau and amyloid-β (Aβ) protein, serves as the neuropathological hallmark of AD. In recent years, the role of
TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a DNA and RNA-binding protein that has been heavily studied in
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fronto-temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP), has drawn increasing
interest for AD pathogenesis. The pathological role of TDP-43 can be attributed to both its neurotoxicity in AD
brain caused by its increased pathological aggregation in various brain regions such as the cortex and its loss
of normal function in the central nervous system. However, the detailed mechanistic role underlying TDP-43
mediated AD progression remains elusive. One established biological role of TDP-43 is to regulate the
expression of transposon elements (TEs), highly repetitive DNA sequences that occupy more than half of human
genome. A hallmark of TEs is that they harbor a three-stranded DNA:RNA hybrid structure referred to as R-
loops, which have been linked to a wide variety of biological events, such as transcriptional regulation and
genomic stability maintenance. Recent publications, along with our preliminary data, suggest a direct role of
TDP-43 in regulating R-loop formation. Our long-term goals are to elucidate the role of TDP-43, via R-loop
regulation, for controlling TE expression in age-related neurodegeneration, and to translate our findings into
clinically relevant strategies for the improved treatment of AD. In this application, we focus on how TDP-43 loss-
of-function results in altered TE expression and leads to AD pathogenesis. Our exciting preliminary data suggest:
1) Global alteration of TE expression and associated changes of the R-loop landscape are observed in human
AD postmortem brains and are distinctive from AD mouse model; 2) Evolutionarily younger TEs show higher
expression levels and stronger R-Loop enrichment than more ancient TEs, in general, and they also harbor more
drastic TE/R-loops changes in AD brains; 3) Stable depletion of TDP-43 in neuronal cells leads to aberrant R-
loop alterations in TEs, concurrent with altered TE expression and 5hmC profiling; 4) TDP-43 directly binds to a
subset of TEs in neuronal cells which overlap with AD associated TEs, and 5) AD patient derived 3D cortical
organoids corroborate cellular and molecular phenotypes of AD, serving as an excellent human model system.
We will test the hypothesis that TDP-43 plays an important role in modulating TE expression via R-loop
regulation, and TE dysregulation due to TDP-43 loss-of-function is critical for AD pathogenesis. Findings
from these studies will provide unique mechanistic insights into the fundamental rules of TE expression
regulation by TDP-43, which has the potential to discover new molecular targets with relevant clinical,
translational, and therapeutic implications."
10826312,"The intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), which has been one of the most deadly infectious diseases globally for decades. TB is not on target to be eradicated, and multi drug-resistant (MDR) strains of Mtb are a growing world health problem, with 500,000 new cases of MDR-TB reported annually. An additional challenge is the resistance of dormant mycobacteria to current antibiotic treatments, leading to long treatment regimens (ranging up to 2 years). It will thus be critical to build on our understanding of the molecular physiology of mycobacteria to gain insight toward improved anti TB treatments. A strategy for new drugs to kill dormant and MDR Mtb is to target Mtb ATP synthesis pathways, and a potential class of molecular targets includes K+ channels, which can modulate membrane potential to affect ATP synthase activity and ATP production. Insertion mutagenesis screens of Mtb have implicated the putative K+ channel-encoding gene Rv3200c as a potential virulence gene (i.e. critical for Mtb survival following infection), although functional, mechanistic studies of this gene have not been pursued in detail. In preliminary experiments using the non-pathogenic model organism Mycobacterium smegmatis, we have found that deletion of the Rv3200c ortholog (Msmeg_Δ1945) leads to decreased cellular ATP levels, consistent with a role for this channel in modulating membrane potential to support ATP production. In addition, our preliminary studies using K+ channel-deleted Mtb (Mtb_ΔRv3200c) further show that MycK deletion enhances sensitivity to killing by the H+/K+ ionophore nigericin (which decreases the transmembrane H+ gradient). These preliminary results support the working hypothesis that the Rv3200c-encoded K+ channel, termed MycK, may be a key modulator of the protonmotive force to regulate mycobacterial ATP levels.
To better understand fundamental mechanisms underlying modulation of the MycK channel, as well as its role in mycobacterial physiology, we propose to 1) determine the ligand activation mechanism of the MycK channel by solving its structure by single particle cryo-electron microscopy, and by identifying the gating mechanism through analysis of single-channel recordings of purified MycK channels; and 2) determine the physiological role of MycK in control of energy metabolism, by measuring ATP levels and metabolic activity in gene-targeted mycobacteria. The new structural and functional data generated in this multi-disciplinary project will contribute to the ultimate goal of developing improved therapies for TB and other mycobacterial infection."

 A primary means of research support for investigators in the Center for Microbial Pathogenesis and Host 
Inflammatory Responses (CMPHIR) in Phase III will be the NIGMS-funded Pilot Grant Program (PGP), 
supplemented with institutional funds ($100,000 per year for each year) to support a Director's Innovation Fund. 
The focus will be on identifying new investigators with research interests consistent with the scientific theme of 
the CMPHIR. Support will be provided for projects that clearly fit within the scientific scope of the CMPHIR, with 
a particular emphasis on investigators whose research is potentially synergistic with existing CMPHIR 
investigators, thereby maximizing opportunities for the development of synergistic collaborations. We will also 
continue the efforts we started in Phase II to support projects that address issues in infectious disease in the 
most comprehensive fashion possible and one that can be integrated with the experimental foundation built in 
Phases I and II. Included among specific areas of interest are projects investigating improved diagnostic 
methods, the development of more effective antimicrobial drugs, the potential to repurpose approved drugs for 
infectious disease applications, vaccine development, the development of biomaterials with anti-infective 
properties, and understanding the impact of host comorbidities on the susceptibility to infection and the response 
to therapeutic intervention. In addition, the PGP and Director's Innovation Fund will be used in support of highly 
strategic external recruitment by other research units at UAMS recruiting new investigators with research 
interests consistent with the scientific theme of the CMPHIR. This will allow the CMPHIR to continue to grow and 
mature into a self-sustaining Center of Biomedical Research Excellence as we move forward into Phase III and 
beyond."

Collagen, the most abundant human protein, provides a scaffold for cells to maintain tissue and organ integrity.
Fibrillar collagen is highly resistant to proteolysis and is degraded by specific matrix metalloproteases (MMPs).
The degradation of fibrillar collagen is an essential part of tissue remodeling and is involved in many normal and
pathological processes. While the degradation of triple-helical collagen monomers is well-studied, degradation
of native collagen fibrils remains poorly understood. Fibrils are insoluble in physiological buffers, heterogeneous,
and extended substrates, making them challenging to study using standard biochemical assays. We have
overcome these limitations by developing a single-molecule method to track and analyze the motion of labeled
MMPs on fibrils using a home-built total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRFM). We propose to
study the roles of MMP1 and MMP9 in degrading type-1 collagen fibrils. MMP1 can degrade triple-helical
collagen, whereas MMP9 cannot degrade triple-helical collagen significantly. However, MMP9 is upregulated in
numerous skin diseases, cancer metastasis, wound, inflammation, pneumonia, and atherosclerosis. We propose
to study the mechanism of fibril degradation by two important MMPs by a combination of single-molecule
tracking, innovative analysis, simulations, ensemble assays, and animal studies."
10853692,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Proximity-based protein modulators such as proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and molecular
glues represent a new therapeutic modality because they can, through proximity-induced protein depletion,
ablate all functions of their targets. Because of their ability to target non-enzymatic proteins, these molecules
have been heralded as key to eliminating the “undruggable” human proteome. However, the transformational
potential of this technology is limited by the necessity of drug-like ligands for target proteins, which are sometimes
intrinsically disordered or do not possess small molecule binding pockets. One of these target proteins is
BCL11A, the transcriptional repressor of fetal hemoglobin and a validated target for the treatment of sickle cell
disease and beta-thalassemia. This proposal focuses on the development of modulators for BCL11A to spur
new therapeutics for these disorders.
 Sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia are the most common genetic hematologic disorders, affecting
millions of people worldwide. In these diseases, oxygen transport to metabolizing tissues is impaired. This leads
to anemia, chronic pain, cardiac and pulmonary issues, decreased liver and spleen functions, etc. Many patients
require costly lifelong care. Extensive research has firmly established that fetal hemoglobin, an alternate form
that is predominantly expressed during development but is silenced in adults, offers protection to patients. Yet,
few therapies exist to reactivate fetal hemoglobin. There is one FDA-approved drug, that although widely
prescribed in the US, does not work in many patients. More recently, gene therapy targeting BCL11A, has
successfully increased fetal hemoglobin in patients by 3 to 4-fold. While exciting, this therapy is costly,
complicated, and has limited access, resulting in only hundreds of patients undergoing these procedures
globally. Because it also requires autologous transplantation of genetically modified cells following myeloablative
conditioning, it is restricted to severely ill patients who have access to advanced clinical care. Clearly, alternative
therapies are needed.
 The research described here aims to leverage chemical biology advances to develop tools for proximity-
based depletion of BCL11A. In proof-of-principle studies, we recently reported first-in-class degraders for
BCL11A (Shen et al., 2022; Yin et al., 2023) that deplete up to ~ 70% of cellular BCL11A. BCL11A loss led to a
significant induction of fetal hemoglobin to levels that, if achieved in patients, will be curative for sickle cell
disease and beta-thalassemia. The proposed work will build on this finding to further advance these degraders
into viable therapeutic leads. Such advancement will require extensive ligand optimization and the development
of cell- and organ-specific delivery vehicles to negate hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and ex vivo treatment.
Beyond sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, the proposed strategy can be used to similarly modulate other
intractable but disease relevant protein targets."

The Bioinformatics Core has served as a key player in the overall success of the NE-INBRE project by facilitating
access to resources, technology, services, and providing training to the network members in the use of
computational and data analysis tools in bioinformatics. Over the past five years, the use of high-throughput
technologies including next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become a commonplace by the NE-INBRE
investigators. Consequently, there has been a tremendous need for developing computational and bioinformatic
infrastructure for the collection, processing, storage, and analysis of large-scale datasets. With parallel
developments in the ever-changing experimental technologies, new bioinformatic algorithms and tools need to be
developed or adopted to meet the growing data analysis needs of the research community. Given the nature of
this complexity, it is extremely challenging for individual institutions to locally develop and maintain sophisticated
infrastructure and technical expertise in bioinformatics. The primary goal of this Bioinformatics Core is to develop
such environment, technology, tools, and services and make them accessible to all members in the NE-INBRE

When the API Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease (ADAD) Colombia Trial (NCT01998841) was
announced in 2012, it launched a new era in AD prevention research. The trial led us to identify ~6,000 persons
from the world's largest ADAD kindred, including nearly 1,200 presenilin 1 (PSEN1) E280A mutation carriers,
who are virtually certain to develop AD and become cognitively impaired at 44 (SD ± 5) years of age; establish
the clinical trials, infusion capability, PET, and MRI infrastructure Colombia needed to conduct interventional
studies in the kindred; and introduce precedent setting scientific, ethical, social support, and logistical paradigms
as well as pioneering sample sharing agreements. Moreover, it demonstrated the ability to evaluate an
experimental treatment in a vulnerable population from a developing country in ways that the participants valued,
such that 94% of participants completed the 5-8 year trial. In recent landmark pivotal trials, the Aβ plaque-clearing
antibody (PCA) treatments lecanemab and donanemab were associated with a significant clinical benefit in mildly
impaired late-onset AD (LOAD) patients, with dramatic Aβ PET and plasma pTau reductions, and significant
effects on other Aβ, tau, neurodegenerative, and inflammatory (A/T/N/I) biomarkers. These data provided
compelling support for the role of Aβ aggregates in the development, treatment, and prevention of AD and
support the use of biomarker endpoints that are likely to be associated with a clinical benefit. Here, we propose
to conduct a two-part clinical trial in 200 cognitively unimpaired and mildly impaired PSEN1 mutation carriers
and 40 placebo-treated non-carriers from this remarkable kindred. In Part 1, carriers will receive up to 18 months
of a plaque-clearing antibody (PCA) treatment (exemplar: donanemab), permitting us to compare the magnitude
of Aβ PET and plasma pTau reductions in this ADAD kindred to that observed in trials of the same drug in Aβ+
mildly impaired LOAD patients and cognitively unimpaired older adults. In Part 2, carriers will be randomized to
receive 1) continued PCA treatment, 2) an oral gamma secretase modulator (GSM) treatment (exemplar:
RG6289) with the potential to minimize the re-accumulation of Aβ aggregates in a complementary, potentially
less expensive, and more scalable way, 3) combined PCA/GSM treatment, and 4) placebo treatment for 18
months. This seamless, double-blind, placebo-controlled, double-dummy study of a PCA and a GSM in
cognitively unimpaired and MCI/mild AD PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers will efficiently address a number of key
questions including (1) determining the efficacy of a PCA in reducing brain amyloid levels in ADAD; (2) examining
the relative efficacy of combination treatment following PCA treatment versus PCA monotherapy versus GSM
monotherapy versus placebo to further lower or maintain low brain amyloid levels as well as on downstream
biomarkers; (3) estimating how long placebo-treated mutation carriers remain amyloid negative following PCA-
induced amyloid clearance; (4) providing a foundation for understanding the longer term clinical impact of the
interventions leveraging the Colombian API Registry; and (5) providing invaluable data and samples for the field."
10848119,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Food insecurity (FI) - a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to
adequate food 1- is a serious public health problem that affects 37% of undergraduate students 2. FI is more
prevalent among students than in the general population 3 and disproportionately impacts students who are
low-income, first generation, or from minoritized racial and ethnic groups 4–6. In addition to exacerbating
existing health disparities, including physical and mental health problems, FI is consistently associated with an
increased risk for eating disorder (ED) pathology. As many as 38-52% of university students with FI meet
criteria for an eating disorder 7,8 with many more students reporting subclinical symptoms. This is an urgent
problem because EDs are associated with increased mortality and morbidity, reduced quality of life, and high
economic burden for individuals and healthcare systems. However, the specific mechanisms linking the
experience of FI to eating behaviors remain largely unknown. One possibility is that feedback loops driven by
1) financial concerns related to FI and 2) “traditional” ED pathways of shape/weight concerns may perpetuate
problem eating behaviors; however, there is yet to be a study examining within-person experiences of these
two pathways in undergraduate students and their impact on academic functioning. Without understanding how
these processes contribute to ED symptoms, it is likely that the efficacy of interventions for EDs in
undergraduate students with FI will be limited. Our scientific premise is that mechanistic knowledge is
critically needed to develop targeted interventions for undergraduate students with FI and EDs, as both FI 9–16
and untreated EDs 17–20 are associated with lower academic functioning, which may have profound impacts on
educational attainment. For this R16 application, we have the following specific aims: 1) Evaluate a positive
feedback loop of dietary restriction due to FI and loss-of-control eating; 2) Evaluate a positive feedback loop of
loss-of-control eating, compensatory dietary restriction due to shape/weight concerns, and dietary restriction
due to FI; and 3) Test how academic performance metrics are associated with FI and ED behaviors on the
daily and cross-sectional levels. The proposed study is innovative and significant because it will evaluate
potential mechanisms linking FI, EDs, and academic functioning. The majority of studies examining these
constructs have been cross-sectional, predictive, or retrospective using between-subjects designs. There have
been relatively few studies that have examined within-person associations between FI and ED symptoms and
no studies that have explored how these daily experiences impact academic performance. Results from this
study will support researchers, clinicians, and academic institutions in better addressing student needs. Data
from this study will enable the modification of existing ED treatments to be more responsive to how ED
pathology may be maintained by FI."
10849623,"Abstract: In the prior funding cycle, we successfully obtained a mechanistic understanding of the chemical basis
for the excellent therapeutic actions in mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) of our carbon nanoparticle (CNP) platform,
poly(ethylene)glycol-hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG-HCCs). We identified new actions that point to profound
new directions for our CNPs. We: 1) discovered that the HCC's broad redox potential extended their action as
a redox mediator among mitochondrial constituents involved in electron transport, i.e. a nanoparticle enzyme, or
“nanozyme”, and 2) identified a new mechanism by which hemorrhage causes cellular toxicity: rapid and
persistent generation of DNA double strand breaks and robust DNA damage response leading to cellular
“senescence”, in which cells become a nidus for inflammation. While senescence could be prevented by PEG-
HCCs, the cells became sensitized to iron toxicity/ferroptosis. This interaction led us to generate a new CNP,
covalently bonding iron chelator, deferoxamine (DEF). Our results indicate DEF-HCC-PEG effectively
addressed hemin and iron-related injury, senescence and ferroptosis. Given that mitochondrial dysfunction and
hemorrhagic contusion (HC) are associated with poor outcome in TBI, these findings directly indicate the benefit
of pursuing these mechanisms. The identification of key mechanistic features of our CNP platform that facilitate
a mitochondrial site of action and new mechanism of hemorrhage-induced pathology form the basis for this
renewal application. We will incorporate our understanding of the PEG-HCC mechanisms of action to generate
a more immediately translatable CNP utilizing a good manufacturing practice (GMP) starting material, activated
charcoal, and test them in-vivo in a rodent TBI with hemorrhagic contusion (TBI/HC). Our overall hypothesis
is that the mechanisms of action discovered in our prior application will be translatable to GMP starting materials
and will act on both the genomic and mitochondrial damage associated with TBI/HC. Specific Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that an oxidizing synthesis environment can be optimized to generate GMP-derived starting
materials, PEG-oxidized activated charcoal achieving, the desired characteristics of a CNP nanozyme. Specific
Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that DEF-linked CNP will address hemorrhage-related mitochondrial and genomic
events triggering senescence and resistance to ferroptosis. Specific Aim 3 will administer the CNPs developed
in Aims 1 and 2 to moderate-severe TBI/HC model. Completion of these Aims will yield a more readily
translatable version of our CNP platform building on a growing understanding of the critical features and sites of
action for their nanozyme mechanisms. New therapeutic targets emerging from a more thorough understanding
of pathological mechanisms by which hemorrhage complicates outcome from TBI will guide the design. By
employing GMP starting material, this project can generate breakthrough materials more rapidly translatable to
the clinic. Because mitochondrial dysfunction and the cellular consequence of hemorrhage are features both of
acute injury and of aging and cognitive decline, a broader potential for this therapy is suggested."

The California Animal Health and Food Safety (CAHFS) system, within the School of Veterinary
Medicine (SVM), is comprised of four laboratories dedicated to veterinary diagnostics. The
CAHFS system is uniquely qualified to assist with the Veterinary Laboratory Investigation
Response Network (Vet-LIRN) mission. Microbial testing of clinical samples and food matricies
is an integral part of our core mission. The large CAHFS system has built in redundancy. All four
locations have bacterial testing capabilities. Thus, CAHFS provides surge capacity that could
benefit FDA and Vet-LIRN in meeting microbiological testing needs and assisting with a
coordinated response to an animal food or product emergency event. As an accredited member
of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians (AAVLD), CAHFS adheres
to rigorous standards and maintains strict oversight of all standard operating procedures to
ensure results are accurate, repeatable, and consistent. FDA protocols published in the
Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) are followed for food pathogen testing including the
Vet-LIRN samples. Incorporation of new food matrices or introduction of new instrumentation
are qualified first by established validation and verification procedures described in AAVLD and
FDA guidelines. Lastly, one of the benefits provided by collaborating with a full-service
veterinary diagnostic facility such as CAHFS is the broad range of expertise present within the
system. We have faculty with a vast breadth of expertise in infectious diseases, zoonotic
infections and food safety diagnostics and interventions. Our infrastructure (both CAHFS and
SVM) is available to provide diagnostic support for Vet-LIRN submissions. All of these
competencies align with the Vet-LIRN mission of expanding the FDA response to animal
food/drug adulteration or contamination. CAHFS participation in this current cooperative
agreement will allow the laboratory to maintain its readiness to respond to Vet-LIRN needs."

 Coupling, or communication between the bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts
during bone remodeling, is a key step in the bone remodeling cycle. While compelling evidence shows that bone
loss and fragility with age and osteoporosis result from corrupted coupling, the precise mechanism of osteoclast-
osteoblast communication remains unclear. Thus, although stimulating coupling is a theoretically attractive
therapeutic target, current treatments for osteoporosis, a common disorder affecting 54 million of the elderly in
the US alone, are limited to either inhibiting osteoclastic bone resorption or stimulating osteoblastic bone
formation. Our long-term goal is to determine the mechanism of osteoclast-osteoblast communication critical for
coupling of bone formation to resorption during physiological bone remodeling, using rare osteopetrotic diseases
as a tool. Rare bone diseases provide important insights into typical bone physiology and knowledge gained
from these diseases has already led to new therapies for osteoporosis.
 In this proposal, we utilize samples from patients with autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type II (ADOII),
a rare inheritable osteopetrosis characterized by high bone mass and skeletal fragility and complement human
studies with mouse models. ADOII results from heterozygous mutations in the CLCN7 gene, which encodes the
ClC-7 Cl-/H+ exchanger essential for osteoclastic bone-resorption. While the lack of osteoclastic resorption
clearly contributes to bone phenotype, bone formation is also inappropriately high. In preliminary data
investigating the bone structural unit (BSU) composition of ADOII bones, we found bone formation is primarily
remodeling based, with excess bone formation called overflow remodeling. Osteoclasts are abundant and
scalloped cement lines suggest an intermittent pit-like resorption mode, which in combination with overflow
remodeling results in a characteristic puzzle-like bone structure. We hypothesize that the anabolically active but
poorly resorptive osteoclasts in ADOII overexpress anabolic coupling factors, inappropriately stimulating bone
formation to overfill the resorbed cavities and leading to disorganized puzzle-like bone and fragility.
 We will test this hypothesis by combining in vivo and in vitro studies of ADOII patients and mouse models,
multimodal and multiscale imaging, biomechanics and spatial/single-nuclei transcriptomics. Specifically, we will:
1) test if the high bone mass and fragility in human and mouse ADOII is osteoclast-mediated; and 2)
investigate the mechanism of inappropriately high bone formation in ADOII by single nuclei
transcriptomic analysis of physically adjacent osteoclasts and osteoblasts.
 The proposed studies take advantage of the unique resource of extant iliac crest bone biopsy specimens
from 15 ADOII patients from a Danish family carrying the CLCN7 (G215R) mutation and age and sex matched
controls, and two mouse models of ADOII, including the analogous Clcn7G213R/+ mutation. Through the lens of
ADOII, these studies will provide unique insights into osteoclast-osteoblast communication."

With over 400,000 preterm births in the US annually, neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are critical to
providing high quality care and ensuring optimal health outcomes for neonates. Neonatal intensive care
units (NICUs) began as open-bays (large rooms, variable size, and multiple newborns admitted), but the
latest NICU design and a growing trend is single family rooms that typically have only one baby admitted
per room and accommodate at least one parent rooming-in. The scholarly literature provides mixed-
evidence on the impact of NICU design changes on patient health outcomes and patient experience of
care. Also, a recent community needs assessment called to reduce disparities in maternal and child
health by race and ethnicity. These lead us to conduct a mixed-methods process and outcome
evaluation examining the impact of a NICU transition from open bay to single family rooms that
occurred at Cone Health in Greensboro, NC. A theoretical benefit of single family room designs is
increased parent-neonate bonding time, yet this assumes that parents routinely room-in with neonates.
Black and low income parents may experience economic and transportation hardships that constrain
their opportunity to room-in at the frequency of white and economically privileged parents. Thus, we
hypothesize that single family rooms disproportionately benefit neonates from economically privileged
families (predominantly white) compared to neonates from families with low incomes (predominantly
Black and LatinX in our community). We will conduct a mixed-methods study that triangulates patient
health outcome data, patient experience surveys, and in-depth interviews with NICU staff to explore
whether different patient sub-populations unequally benefited from or were unintentionally harmed by
a NICU design change from open-bay to single family rooms. A secondary data analysis will help us
determine whether patient health outcomes and patient experience of care changed before vs. after the
NICU transition from open-bay to single family rooms. We will examine health disparities across patient
sub-populations, with special attention to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. We will then collect
and analyze qualitative data to provide rich detail on processes that reproduce health disparities; we will
explore barriers and facilitators to implementing strategies to mitigate unintended consequences,
improve care delivery, improve health outcomes, and reduce health disparities among patient sub-
populations. Using a community engaged approach with a Stakeholder Advisory Board, we will develop
a conceptual framework on the impact of NICU design changes and disseminate lessons learned and
actionable recommendations to drive systemic changes to policies and procedures at health systems to
improve patient quality of care, improve health outcomes, and reduce health disparities."
10849841,"The goal of this proposal is to quantify the role of H3K9me3-based heterochromatin gene silencing in pancreatic beta cell development and to modulate such heterochromatin to obtain more mature beta-like cells from human embryonic stem cells. Type I diabetes (T1D) results from an autoimmune depletion of beta cells within pancreatic islets, resulting in a deficiency in insulin secretion, metabolic imbalances that impair health and lifestyle, and a dependency upon exogenous insulin. Recent studies indicate that T1D also involves beta cell de-differentiation. In 2000, the Edmonton Protocol demonstrated that beta cell transplants from cadavers could elicit exogenous insulin-free survival in severe type I diabetics. Yet success typically requires islets from two cadavers, donors are limiting, and patients can regress to insulin dependence over time. Thus, there is an unmet medical need for donor human beta cells. Extensive research over the past 20 years, including from my laboratory, has defined distinct stages of development of mouse beta cells from the endoderm germ layer and identified numerous signaling effectors. Such information has been used to guide beta-like cell differentiation in vitro from human embryonic stem cells (huESCs). Despite this progress, most laboratories experience difficulty generating robust glucose-responsive insulin secretion (GSIS) in terminal cell products. My lab, for instance, observes robust GSIS in only a limited number of beta-like organoids from huESCs, and generating GSIS-competent cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is an even greater challenge. The lack of consistency from huESCs and the greater difficulty from iPSCs, which can retain an epigenetic memory of their originating cell type, suggests an epigenetic basis. While H3K9me3-based heterochromatic gene silencing has long been thought to constitutively suppress repeat elements in the genome, my laboratory has recently discovered that such heterochromatin is highly dynamic in liver and pancreatic beta cell development and that such heterochromatin also marks the genes that are the most difficult to activate in various cell reprogramming approaches. Indeed, we present evidence that H3K9me3 heterochromatin is not appropriately modulated in beta-like cells derived from huESCs. We propose two Aims to exploit these insights: Aim 1: Quantify the role of H3K9me3 heterochromatin during beta cell maturation in vivo and in vitro.  Aim 2: Employ a knockdown screen of broad and specific heterochromatin modulators during huESC differentiation to beta-like cells to improve glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro and in transplanted animals."

The structure and dynamics of chromatin control the accessibility of DNA to regulatory factors during
transcription, replication, recombination and DNA damage repair. PTMs of chromatin‐associated proteins and
DNA methylation are complex epigenetic mechanisms that regulate gene expression and chromatin
organization. The interplay between these mechanisms generate synergistic or antagonistic interactions that
partition chromatin into (i) euchromatin: lightly packed chromatin, enriched in genes often under active
transcription or (ii) heterochromatin: tightly packed and condensed chromatin, containing mostly silenced
genes. The molecular mechanisms underlying this partition is not fully understood. Recent studies demonstrate
that heterochromatin can assemble through liquid‐liquid phase separation (LLPS) driven by multivalent
interactions between modified histone tails and the proteins that bind these epigenetic modifications.
However, heterochromatin is also highly enriched in methylated DNA, which is reciprocally regulating, and
regulated by the surrounding histone modification binding proteins and enzymes. How methylated DNA
binding proteins and the patterns of DNA methylation co‐ordinate with the histone modification machinery in
the LLPS‐mediated assembly of heterochromatin is not fully understood. This proposal will address these gaps
in knowledge."

 Alcohol and marijuana (cannabinoids) are commonly abused drugs worldwide, and adolescent
co-exposure/co-abuse of these two drugs is hallmarked by high levels of co-morbidity. Both chronic
binge ethanol and cannabinoid consumption enhances the risk of acute lung injury (ALI) and both
community and health care associated pneumonia (CAP and HAP, respectively), leading to increased
morbidity and mortality. We have recently utilized a mouse model for adolescent intermittent ethanol
(AIE) and cannabinoid (AIC) exposure to examine roles of binge exposure to adult-pulmonary
inflammation, and our data suggests that that the prior polysubstance exposure leads to increased
HMGB1 expression and microbial-induced pulmonary inflammation. Interestingly, our in vitro studies
indicate that both alcohol and cannabinoids activate HMGB-1 expression from macrophage cells, and
inhibiting cannabinoid receptors CB1R and CB2R on cells inhibits HMGB-1 expression, and is
recapitulated in vivo using antagonists for CB1R. We aim to investigate CBR signaling as a potential
therapeutic direction in response to alcohol and cannabinoid-dependent pulmonary inflammation."
10852678,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Approximately 50% of patients with ovarian cancer harbor deficiencies in DNA damage repair with
either a germline/somatic mutation in BRCA1/2 or homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), and benefit
from maintenance therapy with a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) following adjuvant platinum-
based chemotherapy. Unfortunately, most of these patients will have a disease recurrence and develop
resistance to PARP therapy for an ultimately non-curable disease. However, innovative combination strategies
can be utilized to overcome resistance as well as provide therapeutic benefit, improving the lives of our
patients.
 We have identified a novel first in class agent, cirtuvivint, that demonstrates single agent activity in
ovarian cancer, potentiates a unique mechanism to overcome PARP resistance, and synergizes with PARP
therapy in PARP resistant ovarian cancer models. Cirtuvivint is a CDC-like kinase (CLK) and dual specificity
tyrosine kinase (DYRK) inhibitor with suspected multiple anti-tumor mechanisms of action. Our preclinical work
has demonstrated three distinct mechanisms of activity of cirtuvivint by 1) increasing alternative splicing
events, 2) inhibiting Wnt transcriptional activity, and 3) increasing R-Loop formation.
 Alternative splicing is a normal physiologic function that allows cells to change isoform-specific protein
production in response to extracellular and intracellular stimuli. Alterations are implicated in tumorigenesis and
metastasis. Cirtuvivint alters alternative splicing in the Wnt genes. Our work established that PARP resistant
high grade serous ovarian cancer cells display hyperactivation of Wnt signaling and increased TCF
transcriptional activity, leading to PARP resistance. We therefore established rationale for combination Wnt
inhibition with PARP therapy to overcome Wnt driven resistance. Additionally, we demonstrate that cirtuvivint
induces DNA damage and R-Loop formation in ovarian cancer cell lines. R-Loops are the DNA-RNA hybrids
created in DNA damage repair. Increased formation of R-Loops lends to susceptibility to PARP independent
DNA damage. Finally, a synergy with PARP inhibition and cirtuvivint was demonstrated in a panel of PARP
resistant ovarian cancer cell lines.
 Based on this rationale Aim 1 will evaluate a Phase I clinical trial of combination cirtuvivint and olaparib
(PARP inhibitor) in platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients with a germline or somatic BRCA/HRD deficiency
who have previously been treated with a PARPi. We will evaluate the safety and tolerability of this combination
with the goal of establishing a recommended phase 2 dosing. Aim 2 will be focused on the evaluation of
CLK/DYRK inhibition induction of R-Loop DNA damage and the subsequent susceptibility to PARP inhibition.
We strive to elucidate the mechanism for synergy of these two drugs and introduce them as a viable
therapeutic strategy for a significant portion of ovarian cancer patients."

The objective of this research is to understand the role and mechanism by which chemoattractant and integrin
signaling plays in the bone marrow selection of B cells and in shaping the peripheral primary B cell repertoire
and its degree of self-reactivity. The fact that 30% of the millions of B cells produced daily express a B cell
receptor with high-avidity for self-antigen suggests we may not be healthy and live a full life in the absence of
central B cell tolerance. Intriguingly, individuals affected by common autoimmune diseases display defects of
central B cell tolerance manifesting with much higher numbers of bone marrow autoreactive B cells entering
the peripheral tissue. However, these individuals also have defects in peripheral tolerance. A better
understanding of how newly generated high-avidity autoreactive B cells are controlled by or escape tolerance
can have profound implications for the development of therapies that may reduce the self-reactive burden of
the circulating B cell population in individuals predisposed to autoimmunity. We have recently documented that
the chemokine receptor CXCR4 is expressed at higher levels by autoreactive B cells undergoing central
tolerance than non-self-reactive B cells licensed to leave the bone marrow. Moreover, in vivo treatment of mice
with a CXCR4 antagonist, releases high-avidity autoreactive B cells from the bone marrow into the circulation
from where they relocate into the spleen. The mechanisms by which CXCR4 signaling retains self-reactive B
cells within the bone marrow is not clear. It is known that CXCR4 signaling can modulate the function of
integrins, molecules that regulate cell adhesion to tissues. Chemokine receptors and integrins can also be
regulated by PI3K signaling or can themselves promote the activity of PI3K, which is important for the positive
selection of immature B cells out of the bone marrow. The goal of this grant is to define the contribution of
CXCR4 and integrin receptors to central B cell tolerance and the impact of central B cell tolerance on
peripheral tolerance and autoimmune responses. Experiments in Aim 1 will establish whether CXCR4 signaling
controls the bone marrow retention of autoreactive B cells in human beings. Aim 2 will resolve the contribution
of integrins in bone marrow B cell selection and the crosstalk between CXCR4, integrins and PI3K.
Experiments in Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the CXCR4-mediated central B cell tolerance process is
necessary to reduce the chances of systemic autoantibody and autoimmune responses. Overall, these studies
are significant because they generate a deeper mechanistic understanding of how B cell tolerance can be
breached during the development of autoreactive B cells to raise the autoreactive capacity of the primary
circulating B cell repertoire and the general risk for autoimmunity."
10850034,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains an aggressive disease due to the lack of targeted therapies and
low rate of response to chemotherapy that is currently the main treatment modality. Compared to other types of
breast cancer, TNBC tumor consists of more immune cells in tumor mass. Recently inhibitors of bromodomain
(BRD) proteins showed very promising results in treatment of cancer including TNBC. For example, JQ1 as a
specific inhibitor of BRD4 blocks the growth of TNBC cells. However, JQ1 developed resistance in TNBC. In
addition, only tumor cells were tested for JQ1 resistance, raising a concern of real recapitulation of the disease
in this model. Therefore, to fully exploit the therapeutic benefit of JQ1, it is necessary to further explore the
mechanisms of JQ1-induced resistance in the context of interactions between TNBC cells and immune cells. In
our preliminary studies, we found that JQ1 treatment increased cell fusion between TNBC cells and one type of
immune cells named monocytes. This process was likely mediated by inhibiting a mediator protein in cell fusion
named Major Facilitator Superfamily Domain Containing 2 (MFSD2). Interestingly the fusion cells resemble
breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), the seed of breast cancer and critical to chemoresistance in TNBC. These
findings led us hypothesize that targeting MFSD2-mediated cell fusion may be a novel strategy to prevent JQ1-
mediated drug resistance in TNBC. To test our hypothesis, we have designed the following three specific aims.
In Aim 1, we will examine whether JQ1 promotes cell fusion through inhibition of MFSD2 in monocytes. In Aim
2, we will examine whether MFSD2 mediates JQ1-induced phenotypical changes of BCSCs in vitro and in vivo.
In Aim 3, we will examine whether JQ1 promotes cell fusion through BRD4-dependent and BRD4-independent
manners by large scale sequencing techniques including CHIP-Seq and RNA-Seq. Successful completion of the
project will lead to future identification of specific MFSD2 activators as drug candidates to prevent JQ1 resistance
in TNBC. In addition, the proposal will be a great vehicle for training undergraduate students at Benedict College
in cancer research using bioinformatics and other techniques in molecular biology."

Chronic diseases impose a crushing burden on older adults and present unique intellectual, methodological,
and statistical challenges to scientists and policy makers. These challenges were highlighted by the
disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults with chronic conditions. In this
resubmission of our renewal application for the UCSF T32 Translational Epidemiology - Training for Research
on Aging and Chronic Conditions (TE-TRAC) program, we build on our successful first funding cycle. TE-TRAC
pre- and post-doctoral trainees focus on aging and chronic diseases affecting the health of older adults,
including Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders, cancer, musculoskeletal, and cardiometabolic disorders.
Our T32 program provides trainees with outstanding quantitative research skills and substantive expertise
relevant to aging, emphasizing: 1) substantive understanding of the epidemiology of aging and the intersection
of biological and social processes relevant to the health of aging populations; 2) rigorous, reproducible analytic
methods for complex data, including causal inference and statistical methods; 3) data skills to identify, access,
link, and use multi-level data resources, such as longitudinal survey-based cohorts, electronic health records or
“omic” information; 4) training in translational research to deliver evidence relevant to policy, clinical, or
behavioral interventions to improve health; and 5) mentorship tailored to ensure trainee success in research
careers. For pre-doctoral trainees, formal classroom training is combined with applied research rotations and
co-curricular activities to foster rapid development of research expertise and expose students to diverse
perspectives and methods. Post-doctoral trainees build individualized research agendas and lay the
groundwork for their future careers. TE-TRAC is housed in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics
and faculty mentors with deep expertise in clinical and population research are drawn from across UCSF and
its affiliates. TE-TRAC leadership works closely with faculty mentors individually and via the Mentoring
Collaborative to foster optimal mentoring skill development. In its first 5 years, TE-TRAC has successfully
recruited excellent trainees who have made outstanding professional progress. To date, 7/17 (41%) trainees
have been from racial/ethnic groups underrepresented in science. Consistent with the goals of the NRSA
program, our alumni have secured desirable positions both inside (78%) and outside (22%) academia. TE-
TRAC has been oversubscribed with strong candidates and strong mentors, requiring that we turn away highly
qualified pre- and post-doctoral fellows who would benefit from participation and enrich the experience of other
trainees. We therefore seek to increase from 2 to 3 second-year pre-doctoral and from 2 to 4 post-doctoral
slots per incoming cohort. An External Advisory Committee will monitor and evaluate the program. The TE-
TRAC program is training exceptional quantitative researchers prepared to leverage the rapidly expanding
methodologic and data repertoires available to address urgent questions on the health of aging populations."

Programmed cell death (PCD) and has vital roles in organismal health and is essential to normal development.
Apoptosis is genetically programmed and mutations in regulatory genes contribute greatly to cancer therapy
resistance. Timely clearance of cellular debris following cell death is also critical as defects lead to inflammation
and are linked to autoimmune disease. Most cells in the body are highly differentiated and have intricate
morphologies. This presents challenges in the execution of cell death and clearance, as the subcellular
architecture and microenvironment of different compartments of the same cell may differ vastly. Complex cells
can die as a whole or in part. In the case of region-specific degeneration, cellular extensions are exclusively
dismantled leaving the rest of the cell intact. For neurons, such pruning is important in establishing appropriate
connectivity and thus for proper brain function. The central question addressed here is how morphologically
complex cells are eliminated. The C. elegans tail-spike cell is a valuable model to study complex cell
degeneration, dying through an elaborate, likely universal, compartment-specific program of cell death during
embryonic development. We have termed this remarkable program Compartmentalized Cell Elimination (CCE),
which also occurs in a set of sex-specific neurons, suggesting this may be a universal program of death. The
tail-spike cell also shows differential genetic regulation at the levels of both compartmental killing and clearance.
As such, a study of this single cell can provide insights on many facets of cell elimination. This proposal
leverages the fact that the tail-spike cell can be studied in its native context in the living animal as well as the
facile genetics of C. elegans to tackle three broadly related overarching questions: How does mitochondrial
trafficking influence cell process elimination? What novel genes govern CCE and hence cell death and removal
broadly? What novel genes regulate CCE in other complex cells, such as neurons? We will perform advanced
cell biological and genetic studies to address these questions. The proposed experiments, by illuminating
fundamental principles of basic cell biology, will advance the field of cell death in several ways. They will
identify novel regulators of PCD and clearance; they hold the potential to help devise targeted therapies against
cell-death-related disease, including cancer, neurodegeneration, immune and developmental disorders."

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15–20% of all breast cancers. Women with TNBC are three
times more likely to experience death compared to other subtypes. The poor prognosis of TNBC can be attributed
to the lack of effective targeted therapy. Although TP53 mutations are frequently found in TNBC, it is difficult to
target p53-deficiency with drugs. We have identified a family of non-canonical phosphatidylinositol kinases, the
phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinases (PI5P4Ks) and their crucial role in the growth of cancers with TP53
aberrations. Furthermore, we discovered a role for the PI5P4Ks in autophagy, and for the first time, showed that
these enzymes localize to lysosomes, suggesting that the PI5P4Ks may be important for lysosome function, as
well as shedding light on the anti-cancer mechanism of PI5P4K inhibition in p53 mutant cancers. Using preclinical
studies in novel genetically engineered mouse breast tumor models, human breast cancer cell lines, and patient
breast tumor samples we propose to investigate the biochemical basis for the function of these ‘druggable’
enzymes. We will also validate them as targets for pharmaceutical intervention in human cancers, especially for
TNBC where targeted therapies have not been successful. Our overarching hypothesis is that the PI5P4Ks act
as sensors of metabolic stress that allow cells to modulate lysosomal events, including autophagy, in order to
maintain cellular homeostasis. Further, we posit that the metabolic rewiring associated with p53 mutations,
create a novel dependency on the PI5P4Ks for TNBC cell growth and survival.
In Aim 1 we will determine the mechanism of synthetic vulnerability by which the PI5P4Ks become essential for
tumor cell growth when p53 is defective. To this end we will characterize how mutant p53, both loss of function
and gain of function, contributes to the synthetic lethality as well as dissect the metabolic consequences of
PI5P4K loss in p53 mutant TNBC cells.
In Aim 2 we will test the therapeutic effectiveness of targeting the PI5P4Ks in TNBC using our genetically
engineered mouse breast tumor models and patient breast tumor samples.
The ultimate goal and the overall impact of this project are to characterize PI5P4Ks as a novel liability for tumors
with TP53 mutations in order to define opportunities for therapeutic intervention for TNBC patients with these
mutations, which currently lack targeted therapy."

The pivotal goals of diabetes treatment are to minimize diabetes complications and improve quality of life for
individuals with diabetes. In-depth analyses from large scale, randomized trials and epidemiological studies
have indicated that glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), the primary metric for assessing glycemic control, alone
may not sufficiently predict the risk of diabetes complications. Near-normal HbA1c level did not consistently
improve diabetes complications. People with similar HbA1c values can have markedly different glucose profiles
with varying frequencies and amplitudes of hypo- and hyper-glycemia. Glucose variability (GV) refers to
fluctuations in blood glucose levels throughout the day (intra-day GV) or over days (inter-day GV) and is an
emerging predictor of diabetes complications. GV can be measured in real-time through continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM). Considerable research in CGM to understand GV has led to the growing use of CGM in
clinical practice among individuals with type 1 diabetes. However, few studies address factors that affect GV in
type 2 diabetes (T2D), leaving large gaps in knowledge about how to mitigate GV and improve diabetes
outcomes in T2D. Roles of individuals’ lifestyle behaviors, emotional well-being and social-built environments
in glucose control have been well documented. Also, real-time data on lifestyle such as day-to-day sleep,
physical activity and diet are being generated. However, how these factors are associated with GV has yet to
be examined. This study will be one of the first to prospectively examine the temporal relationships among
sleep, physical activity, diet, emotional well-being, and GV, incorporating between-person associations and
within-person variability among adults of diverse race/ethnicity with T2D. We will use a real-time, data capture
strategy, ecological momentary assessment to measure lifestyle factors and emotional well-being. Three 24-hr
dietary recalls will be conducted to collect nutrient-level data. We will also use actigraphy as objective
measures of sleep and physical activity paired with CGM, a real-time, unobtrusive glucose measure that will be
blinded from participants during a study period of 14 days. The specific aims of the study are to: (1) identify risk
factors associated with high GV among diverse adults with T2D by examining between-person associations
among demographics, clinical factors, lifestyle (sleep, physical activity, diet) factors, the variability of each
lifestyle factor, emotional well-being, social-built environmental factors and inter-day GV, (2) identify ‘within-
person predictors’ of GV to inform the development of personalized diabetes interventions by examining within-
person associations among sleep, physical activity, diet, emotional well-being and intra-day GV, and (3)
examine which lifestyle factors either mediate or moderate the relationship between emotional well-being and
GV among diverse adults with T2D. The findings from the proposed study will guide clinical decision-making
for healthcare providers to facilitate effective treatment using CGM and inform the development of personalized
interventions to mitigate GV and improve diabetes outcomes."
10831527,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), critically involved in learning and memory, is a vulnerable region in both
age-related cognitive impairment (ARCD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Causal upstream signaling
mechanisms that lead to AD remain poorly understood. Across lifespan, excess reactive oxygen species (ROS)
accumulate, causing oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA. This process is termed oxidative stress
(OS). Dietary antioxidants (AOs) normally scavenge excess ROS, preventing OS. Moreover, OS triggers AO
defenses, which ultimately yield to AD progression. Yet, to date, clinical trials involving AO supplementation have
paradoxically failed, exposing large knowledge gaps in understanding which AO species are depleted, the time
course of AO depletion, and the underlying mechanisms. The AO all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a bioactive form
of Vitamin A (VA), serves a dual role as a ROS scavenger and hormone-like ligand for the retinoic acid receptor
(RAR). Ligand binding to RARs is critical for transcriptional regulation of genes containing retinoic acid response
elements (RAREs). Recent evidence from rodents has demonstrated an age-dependent homeostatic collapse
in hippocampal ATRA levels. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that transcriptional silencing occurs in AD.
To investigate ATRA depletion, we performed a secondary analysis of hippocampal transcriptomic data from
post-mortem AD brains. ATRA-sensitive genes were downregulated, accompanied by upregulation of RAR
repressors. Moreover, several histone deacetylases (HDACs) were upregulated, providing evidence for
epigenetic changes. Given this strong scientific premise, we hypothesize that both ATRA bioavailability and
HDAC inhibition are required to restore ATRA-mediated gene transcription and hippocampal-dependent
learning. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that combining vitamin A supplementation and HDAC inhibition
(HDACI) maintains hippocampal-dependent learning and RAR-sensitive gene transcription in DG more
effectively than HDACi alone. Using an innovative multidisciplinary approach, we will determine effects of
combining VA supplementation with HDAC inhibition on learning and transcription of RAR-sensitive genes in DG
cell types. SA1 tests the hypothesis that VA supplementation alleviates AD-related learning deficits and multi-
omic signatures in the DG. SA2 tests the hypothesis that HDAC inhibition alleviates AD-related learning deficits
and multi-omic signatures in the DG. SA3 tests the hypothesis that combining VA supplementation and HDAC
inhibition (VA+HDACI) synergistically alleviates AD-related learning deficits and multi-omic signatures in the DG
beyond VA and HDACI alone. Successful completion of this project will increase knowledge of aberrant
transcriptional mechanisms occurring in the DG during AD. Integrating behavioral and multi-omic data, the
project will elucidate multi-omic signatures in DG that protect against AD, enable the discovery of new genes
necessary for DG function, and determine the value of drug repurposing for an FDA- approved HDAC inhibitor."

Developmental Funds are a critical component of this CCSG. These funds are used to shape the future
Membership of the Koch Institute, and to ensure that the Center’s Core Facilities meet the needs of the
Membership. Developmental Funds are used in support of two distinct areas: Faculty Recruitment and 
development of new Core Facilities.
The recruitment and support of early career development of new faculty is one of the principal goals of the 
CCSG Developmental Funds. Historically, this has been a highly successful use of these funds, which are 
leveraged with additional support from MIT. New Investigators are recruited through a stringent evaluation 
process. As part of the recruitment process, a start-up package is negotiated that includes salary support, 
initial equipment purchases as well as funds for laboratory operating expenses for up to three years. These 
funds are necessary to allow the new faculty members to establish their laboratories and obtain independent 
funding. Start-up support for new faculty came from CCSG funds (typically 1/3 of the cost) with the balance 
coming from the Dean of Science or Engineering and the Provost. 
The second use of these funds is for the development of new Core Facilities, in particular the expertise to 
operate state-of-the-art-instrumentation and provide new leading edge services, all based on the ever changing scientific demands of Center Members. This need reflects the emergence of new technologies both 
at the outset and over the course of the proposed funding period.

as a physician-scientist studying molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. The
candidate is a MD/PhD neurologist with a background in neurodegenerative disease research. The award will
help the candidate achieve his short-term goal, to gain research experience in the molecular pathogenesis of
neuroimmune activation and neurodegeneration in models of Alzheimer disease (AD)-like pathology and
facilitate his transition to an investigator with an independent laboratory. The award will also help position the
candidate to achieve his long-term goal of becoming a successful and productive physician-scientist and a leader
in academic neurology. The environment in which the proposed research will be conducted is outstanding. The
candidate’s primary mentor, Dr. David Holtzman, is an internationally respected scientist and neurologist with a
proven track record of excellence in training junior faculty. The candidate’s career development plan includes
structured co-mentorship from Dr. John Morris, also an internationally respected neurologist and clinician-
scientist, who will supervise the candidate’s clinical training and development of clinical research skills. Drs.
Holtzman and Morris have a track record of co-mentoring numerous junior faculty to successful independent
research careers in neurology. Didactic learning, presentation of work at scientific meetings, and rigorous training
in the responsible conduct of research will ensure a balanced development. The proposed research will examine
the role of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) in modulating the neuroimmune response to ApoE-dependent amyloid
pathology and tau-mediated neurodegeneration. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that activation of immune
mediators is a critical regulator of AD pathology. However, the exact role that microglia play in modulating AD
pathogenesis is still difficult to parse, partly due to discrepant effects of microglial function in models of
amyloidosis and tauopathy. Microglial response to amyloid and tau deposition is dependent on apolipoprotein E
(ApoE) as evidenced by experiments where ApoE expression is genetically deleted. 25-HC is produced exclusively
by microglia, is a potent modulator of microglial response, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune
neurological disease and modulates the production of ApoE. The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that
microglial production of 25-HC modulates ApoE-dependent neuroinflammatory responses and neurodegeneration in
mouse models of amyloid and tau deposition. Clarifying the role of 25-HC and ApoE in these processes will provide
insights into AD pathobiology and ultimately should point towards novel therapeutic targets that can be leveraged
to treat AD and related dementias. This career development award is an ideal mechanism to provide the
candidate with valuable research training which will complement his clinical focus in Aging and Dementia and
will help develop a skill set for translating basic science discoveries into effective therapies for patients with
neurodegenerative diseases."
10833109,"Abstract
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a progressive disorder mediated by pathological changes in molecular cascades
and neural circuit remodeling in the hippocampus resulting in increased susceptibility to spontaneous seizures
and cognitive dysfunction. Targeting these cascades could prevent or reverse symptom progression and has the
potential to provide viable disease-modifying treatments that could reduce the portion of TLE patients (>30%)
not responsive to current medical therapies. The Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription
(JAK/STAT) pathway has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of TLE. This pathway is known to be
involved in inflammation and immunity, and to be critical for neuronal functions such as synaptic plasticity and
synaptogenesis. Our laboratories previously showed that a STAT3 inhibitor, WP1066, could greatly reduce the
number of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) in an animal model of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus
(SE). While this suggests promise for JAK/STAT inhibitors as disease-modifying therapies, the potential adverse
effects of systemic or global CNS pathway inhibition limits their use. Development of more targeted therapeutics
will require a detailed understanding of JAK/STAT-induced epileptogenic responses in different cell types. To
this end, we have developed a new transgenic line where dimer-dependent STAT3 signaling is functionally
knocked out (fKO) by tamoxifen-induced Cre expression specifically in forebrain excitatory neurons (eNs) via the
Calcium/Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase II alpha (CamK2a) promoter. We now report that STAT3 KO in
excitatory neurons (eNSTAT3fKO) markedly reduces the progression of epilepsy (SRS frequency) in the
intrahippocampal kainate (IHKA) TLE model and protects mice from kainic acid (KA)-induced memory deficits
as assessed by Contextual Fear Conditioning. Using data from bulk hippocampal tissue RNA-sequencing, we
further discovered a transcriptomic signature for the IHKA model that contains a substantial number of genes,
particularly in synaptic plasticity and inflammatory gene networks, that are down-regulated after KA-induced SE
in wild-type but not eNSTAT3fKO mice. In this application, we will test the hypothesis that STAT3 signaling in
excitatory neurons is a key driver of epilepsy progression via the selective silencing of genes that regulate
synaptic plasticity and neuroinflammation. With an integration of open discovery using multiomics and
quantitative molecular imaging (Aims 1 and 3), in combination with electrophysiology and neuropharmacology
(Aim 2), we will elucidate the genome’s response to injury (24 h and 4 wks after IHKA) within different cell types
and determine why STAT3 KO in eNs inhibits disease progression after KA injection by identifying direct and
indirect effects of loss of eNSTAT3 expression on both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We will also determine
the relationship between eNSTAT3 signaling and glial activation by examining effects of eNSTAT3KO on the glial
transcriptome and inflammatory markers of microglia and astrocytes. Our results will ascertain if cell-type specific
modulation of STAT3 signaling or its downstream targets are promising strategies for therapeutic intervention."
10845554,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award is designed to allow the candidate to achieve her long-term
goal to establish an independent research career focused on how arousal circuits in the brain control
breathing, and how these neural mechanisms are influenced by opioids. This proposal has been tailored to
supplement the candidate’s background in neuroscience and respiratory neurophysiology with additional
knowledge and technical skills to study respiratory control circuits in vivo and ex vivo, and will make her ideally
suited to succeed on her career path. The primary cause of death from an opioid overdose is respiratory
depression. The sedative effect of opioids further impairs respiratory drive through largely unexplored
mechanisms. Although overdoses are routinely treated with the opioid antagonist, naloxone, naloxone
reverses all opioid effects, causing pain and withdrawal. Our current understanding of opioid effects on the
respiratory circuitry has not revealed an ideal therapeutic target to minimize respiratory depression without
serious side effects. Therefore, it is essential to identify new strategies to alleviate respiratory depression and
stimulate breathing. This proposal seeks to uncover important new insights whereby the locus coeruleus (LC),
a brain structure widely known for its contributions to arousal, influences the Kӧlliker-Fuse (KF), a key
respiratory region, which is highly sensitive to opioids and critical for opioid-induced respiratory depression.
Preliminary data spanning cell-type specific neural tracing, ex vivo brain slice recordings, and in vivo
optogenetics and fiber photometry, support a role for LC input to the KF in respiration, which has not been
previously appreciated. Based on preliminary data, the overall hypothesis is that the LCKF circuit is a critical
modulator of respiratory function, particularly during opioid-induced respiratory depression. The candidate’s
prior training in brain slice recordings, in vivo electrophysiology in awake animals, and intersectional viral-
genetic methods provides a solid foundation for the state-of-the-art ex vivo and in vivo optogenetics and fiber
photometry techniques in the proposal. This multi-level approach will allow the candidate to test the hypothesis
that KF neurons receive opioid-sensitive, monosynaptic excitatory input from LC neurons (Aim 1), that KF
projecting LC neuron activity is coupled with respiration in vivo (Aim 2), and the LCKF circuit plays a key
role in respiration and opioid-induced respiratory depression (Aim 3). Together, the aims of this proposal will
yield novel information regarding the brain’s control of respiration and will also provide strong conceptual and
methodological training, enabling development of an impactful and successful independent research program.
Strong mentorship by Drs. Erica Levitt and David Fuller, as well as a Mentoring Committee comprised of
established professors, who are experts in the proposed techniques and have extensive mentoring
experience, will help the candidate achieve the research and career development goals of this proposal."
10832997,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The somatic cells remain quiescent upon terminal differentiation. Perturbation of this process can lead to cell
quiescence exit and proliferation, which is implicated in cancer and tissue regeneration. The dimerization
partner, RB-like, E2F, and multi-vulval class B (DREAM) complex, also called the DRM complex in
Caenorhabditis elegans and dREAM complex in Drosophila melanogaster, is an evolutionarily conserved cell
cycle-regulatory multiprotein complex. In association with co-activators and co-repressors, the DREAM
complex directly modulates the expression of various genes directly related to cell cycle and cell quiescence.
However, it is unknown how the DREAM complex is regulated in the physiological and pathological conditions.
Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-associated factor (PAF; also known as PCLAF/KIAA0101) is highly
upregulated in many cancers but barely expressed in normal cells. Our comprehensive approaches, including
molecular and cellular biology, mouse genetics, proteomics, and transcriptomics, found that PAF is
indispensable for cell quiescence exit and cell proliferation possibly by remodeling the DREAM complex.
Based on our previous studies and preliminary results, we hypothesize that PAF remodels the repressive
DREAM for cell quiescence exit and proliferation for the maintenance and activation of cell stemness in lung
cancer and lung tissue regeneration. This central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: Aim
1) Decipher the molecular mechanism of the PAF-remodeled DREAM complex; Aim 2) Determine the
pathological and physiological roles of PAF and PAF-expressing cells in lung cancer and tissue regeneration.
The proposed study will address how PAF remodels the DREAM complex for bypassing the cell quiescence
and accelerating cell proliferation. Similarly, how stem and facultative progenitor cells become active/mitotic for
tissue regenerating will be addressed by testing the working model - ‘PAF-remodeled DRAEM complex
induces the cell cycle re-entry of the stem and progenitor cells upon tissue injury’. This study will establish a
new paradigm in lung cancer initiation and regeneration by revealing how the remodeling of the DREAM
complex contributes to pathological (cancer) and physiological (regeneration) processes. Moreover, the
completion of this study may propose the PAF-DREAM axis as a targetable vulnerability of lung cancer."
10832999,"Training physician-scientists in the fields of inflammation, tissue injury, trauma and sepsis is the primary
goal of the University of Washington Trauma, Injury and Inflammation Research Training Program.
Trauma, tissue injury and sepsis remain major causes of morbidity and mortality in developed and developing
countries; understanding the biology of the host response to injury and infection and translating our knowledge
into improving patient outcomes are ongoing needs. Our trainees are mentored and given the tools to establish
independent research careers and advance the knowledge in this broad field.
 Our trainees will continue to primarily come from general surgery and related subspecialty training
programs. They will select a mentoring committee, which includes a primary research mentor, additional
research advisors and collaborators and one or more career mentors who will provide guidance and
feedback on a regular basis to the trainee. The research “raw material” will primarily be human samples and
data that are obtained as part of the ongoing clinical and translational research programs at Harborview
Medical Center and the University of Washington. Trainees will learn and apply systems biology tools and
methods to their chosen research problem.
 The initial years of this new training program emphasized translational research and required trainees to
complete a master's degree through the School of Public Health, unless they already had a graduate degree.
We will continue to require this for many of our trainees. While bench research was not a focus of the initial
years of this program, we have expanded the research opportunities to provide our trainees the opportunity to
focus on translational bench research if they choose. Our program continues to have a single track where
trainees are focused on translational aspects of the biologic response to trauma, tissue injury and
sepsis.
 We request an increase the number of stipends to support 2 incoming trainees per year (from the
previously awarded 1 trainee per year). Over the past 4 years, we have demonstrated a sufficient applicant
pool and the research infrastructure and mentorship to support this increase. Further, we have expanded our
applicant pool and trainee research opportunities to ensure we can continue to support two incoming trainees
per year.
 In summary the three legs of our research training program are: 1) Mentored research that provide the
raw material and mentored exposure to systems biology and translational research. 2) Opportunities to
obtain a master's degree focused on methods and skills required to develop a successful research career. 3)
Infrastructure that supports biomedical research education and an environment encouraging diversity and
collaboration."
10833004,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a major cause of inpatient hospitalizations in the United States, and
comprises a heterogeneous population with appreciable variability in patient outcomes amongst hospitals.
Nationally, 30-day mortality rates are estimated at 7%; however, mortality and readmission rates vary widely
across hospitals. Such variability suggests the potential to improve patient care and save lives by identifying
modifiable factors that influence outcomes after hospitalization with GIB. Patient-related factors, hospital
structure and processes of care play major roles in determining outcomes for many other diseases, but the
impact of these factors on outcomes related to GIB has not been adequately defined. The objective of this
proposal is to identify and understand sources of variation in care for patients with GIB, including patient-level
factors, organization (i.e. structure) and processes of care (e.g.. endoscopic and interventional radiology
utilization) amongst hospitals. Our central hypothesis is that modifiable factors impact patient outcomes during
hospitalizations for GIB, which include both structural characteristics and processes of care. Our proposal is to
build a multi-level model of patient outcomes standardized across hospitals, accounting for patient factors and
assess the impact of hospital factors, and then qualitatively explore additional processes of care, through the
following interrelated specific aims: Aim 1- To develop a risk-standardized model for GIB outcomes across
hospitals using Medicare inpatient, outpatient, and pharmaceutical claims data. To ensure generalizability and
clinical applicability, model validation will be performed in a multipayer, multicenter database and using UPenn
health system data which contains clinical variables. Aim 2 - to identify hospital factors (structures and
processes of care) associated with GIB outcomes, using a combined dataset of the aforementioned Medicare
data with American Hospital Association Annual Survey data. Aim 3 – to explore barriers and facilitators of
processes of care for inpatient GIB among hospitals with better and worse patient outcomes, using qualitative
methods. This mixed methods approach will allow for a comprehensive evaluation of drivers of variation in care
for gastrointestinal bleeding. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will identify important
modifiable factors in care associated with patient outcomes for those hospitalized with GIB. This can lead to
the development and validation of quality metrics to improve patient care. To facilitate completion of the
research and further the academic development of the applicant, the PI will enroll in coursework that builds on
her Master of Science by focusing on statistical methods using clustered and longitudinal data, data analytics
in confounding, and qualitative methodologies. This proposal has unequivocal and outstanding divisional and
institutional support and exceptional mentorship of experienced faculty with a strong track record in
epidemiology, health services research, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. These activities will
allow the PI to develop the skills necessary to become a successful independent NIH-funded investigator and a
leader in GI-related health services research."
10833499,"Project Summary/Abstract
Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is a common pre-malignant condition in which one or a few hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells (HSPCs) contribute disproportionately to peripheral blood. Heterozygous somatic mutations in
about 20 genes are associated with CH, some of which are frequent in hematologic malignancies. Although
evidence suggests individuals with CH are at high-risk for malignant transformation, the mechanisms by which
CH arises and contributes to leukemogenesis remain poorly understood. Revealing these mechanisms is a
priority for disease prevention, and an overall goal of our Program. In our preliminary studies, we showed that
inflammation can drive expansion of Dnmt3a-mutant HSPCs. Further, we developed a novel mosaic mouse
model by transplanting a mixed population of HSPCs from five different CH-associated mutant mouse lines as
donor cells (5x mosaic mice). We then exposed these mice to modifiable external stressors and tracked
expansion of HSPC clones harboring certain mutations. We observed stress-specific clonal selection of different
mutant HSPCs. Building on these data and leveraging the team’s expertise, Project 1 will test the hypothesis
that inflammatory stress leads to epigenetic and metabolic changes in HSPCs with CH-associated mutations to
accelerate clonal expansion and malignant transformation. We will create 5x mosaic mice with mutations in five
common CH-associated genes that play critical roles in epigenetics, splicing, and signaling responses: Dnmt3a,
Tet2, Asxl1, Jak2, and Sf3b1. We will use this novel 5x mouse model to investigate the mechanisms through
which infection (Aim 1) and high-fat diet-induced inflammation and metabolic changes (Aim 2) accelerate clonal
selection, expansion, and malignant transformation of HSPCs. In both aims, we will further investigate whether
intervening in inflammatory and metabolic pathways could attenuate clonal expansion and leukemia
development. In Aim 3, we will explore the impact of inflammation on cooperative expansion of Dnmt3a- and
Tet2-mutant HSPC clones. Our team has presented a large body of preliminary studies to strongly support the
feasibility of our proposed innovative approaches and overall hypothesis. Our mouse models and the quantitative
approaches used in Core A to delineate expansion and malignant transformation of individual HSPC clones in
response to modifiable inflammatory stressors are technically innovative. This research is conceptually
innovative, as it introduces novel insights into how modifiable risk factors selectively drive clonal expansion of
HSPCs and leukemogenesis across an expanded range of genetic defects. This Project will interact extensively
by sharing 5x-mosaic model and quantitative detection technologies as well as transcriptomic data with Project
2 (genotoxic stress and DDR genes), and by mechanistically testing causal connections between stressors,
drugs, proteomic and epigenetic changes and CH from Project 3 (analysis of CH and malignancy in a large
human community cohort). The Overall Program will clarify the mechanisms by which CH progresses toward
malignancy and provide the groundwork for risk stratification of CH-associated mutations in humans."
10833502,"Project Summary/Abstract
The overall goal of Project 2 is to determine how mutations in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway interact
with genotoxic stressors to cause clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and malignant transformation. CH is associated
with ~20 recurrently-mutated genes and an 11-fold increase in risk of hematologic malignancies. Among the
genes commonly mutated in CH are PPM1D, TP53, ATM, CHEK2, and SRCAP, all of which are involved in
DDR. This finding raises the possibility that DNA damage exerts a selective pressure allowing DDR-mutant
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to clonally expand, causing CH. Indeed, we have shown that
murine HSPCs carrying a CH-associated Ppm1d mutation gain competitive advantage over wild-type HSPCs
after cisplatin treatment. To compare the effects of CH-associated mutations in promoting clonal expansion upon
genotoxic stressors, we created a novel CH mouse model in which five CH mutant HSPCs were co-transplanted
with wild-type HSPCs and treated recipient mice with cisplatin (termed 5x mosaic model). We found that Ppm1d
and Trp53 mutant cells outcompeted other CH mutants, such as Dnmt3a and Tet2, supporting the concept that
genotoxic stressors specifically select for DDR-mutant cells. In Project 2, we will test the hypothesis that
mutations in the DDR confer a selective advantage to HSPCs exposed to DNA damaging agents, such as
chemotherapies or cigarette smoke, which is associated with a replication error mutational signature. In Aim 1,
we will use the 5x mosaic strategy with mutations in the five common DDR genes mentioned above. We will
expose these mice to chemotherapies or cigarette smoke and determine whether particular exposures favor
specific mutant HSPCs. Although DDR mutations are found frequently in CH, they are less common in malignant
clones, raising a question as to how DDR-mutant CH promotes hematologic malignancies. Here, we will use our
novel 5x model to examine whether DDR-mutant HSPCs promote hematologic malignancies in a cell extrinsic
manner, such as by generating an environment favorable to transformed cells. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine
whether interventions targeting apoptosis, inflammation, or oxidative stress mitigate CH and its risk of
transformation to hematologic malignancy. This Project is highly integrated with other Projects, as it will
differentiate the effects of genotoxic stressors from other causes of inflammation by comparing data with Project
1, and it will share technical innovations with Project 1. With these models, we will be able to iteratively validate
the stressor-mutation interactions found in humans in Project 3. Results from Project 2 will provide novel insights
into how DDR mutations allow HSPCs to expand following exposure to the genotoxic stressors chemotherapy
and cigarette smoke. These mechanistic studies may reveal potential interventions against CH and, importantly,
malignant transformation. This Project will use Core A for single-cell sequencing experiments and WGS of murine
colonies. Core B (administrative) will support this Project by coordinating all aspects of the Program, ensuring
rigor and reproducibility, and facilitating public sharing of data."

Project 3 will test the hypothesis that modifiable risk factors, including inflammation and DNA-damaging factors,
influence expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) clones with certain genetic mutations and
their transformation to hematologic malignancy. We will identify modifiable risk factors associated with HSPC
clonal expansion and malignant transformation in a prospective epidemiologic study of 9,513 persons (Black
27%, female 55%) now all >75 years old from ARIC, a long-standing community cohort study. We will use stored
buffy coat for single cell DNA sequencing, and leverage completed peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) whole
exome sequencing (WES), methylation, and proteomic profiling. Aim 1 will determine long-term changes in clonal
composition at the single-cell level with resources from Core A and identify inflammation and DNA damage-
related factors associated with those changes. For 250 ARIC participants with ³1 clonal variant by WES at Time
1 or at Time 2 (20 years later) and/or hematologic malignancy after Time 2, we will measure individual leukocyte
variant profiles at both times by single cell-DNA sequencing. By tracking individual clones at unprecedented
resolution, we will assess clonal fitness and identify modifiable risk factors for expansion of clones with specific
variants. Our study is the first to address change in clonal composition with hematologic malignancy in a
community cohort. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the association of clonal composition, variant allele frequencies
(VAFs), and changes of known myeloid malignancy driver genes and novel recurrent variants with hematologic
malignancy risk over the span of two decades. In 9,513 participants, we will interrogate WES data at Time 1 and
2 (20 years apart) to identify novel recurrent variants with changing VAFs and classify participants by clonal
composition and VAFs of known driver genes. For driver genes, we will estimate associations of change in clonal
composition and VAF over time with hematologic malignancy risk. We project 341 first and 66 second primary
hematologic malignancies within our cohort. Aim 3 will evaluate the association of inflammation- and DNA
damage-related factors with hematologic malignancy risk in persons with detectable clonal variants. By Time 2,
we expect >10% of participants will have clonal variants detectable by WES in driver and novel genes. We will
estimate the association of modifiable factors with hematologic malignancy in persons with and without specific
clonal variants over 30 years. Project 3 will identify drugs to test as interventions for clonal expansion and
malignant transformation in mice in Projects 1 and 2. We also will test associations between altered cytokines
and CpG methylation identified in Project 1 and determine whether mutations identified in Project 2 are observed
in participants with DNA-damaging exposures. This Project will extensively utilize Core A for single-cell analysis
and Core B for coordination. Identifying modifiable factors that drive clonal expansion and malignant
transformation will provide opportunities to intercept clonal expansion and malignant transformation and enable
early detection in persons at higher risk due to their genetic and modifiable risk factor profile."

This Program brings together a multidisciplinary team from Baylor College of Medicine, MD Anderson Cancer
Center, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Texas A&M University, and Rice University to
examine factors influencing the progression of clonal hematopoiesis to hematologic malignancy in mice and
humans. To facilitate this bold undertaking, Core B (the Administrative Core) will coordinate the activities of the
Program. This Core will (1) facilitate communication within and outside the Program by organizing monthly
scientific meetings including all Program participants and quarterly meetings of Program leadership. The Core
will facilitate an annual meeting including all participants and internal and external advisory board members to
discuss progress and generate feedback. In addition, the Core will ensure that work is communicated to the
scientific community in a timely fashion through presentations, publications, and data release. (2) The Core will
be responsible for sound fiscal management including budgeting and distribution of funds. (3) The Core will
coordinate ongoing evaluation of the Program through internal and external advisory boards and will use the
advisory feedback to adjust the Program plans as needed. (4) The Core will be responsible for ensuring
compliance with ethical considerations with regard to animal and IRB protocol approvals and good laboratory
practices. The Core will ensure that all participating investigators have appropriate and current ethics training.
The Core will also oversee research rigor by ensuring training of all Program personnel and rigorous review.

10833285,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Maintenance, remodeling, and repair of the adult body is mediated by multipotent stem cells that give rise to a
variety of cell types that comprise the tissue in which they reside. During aging, there is a decline in homeostatic
and regenerative capacity leading to progressive degeneration of the structure and function of vital organs. In
particular, musculoskeletal degeneration is common in the elderly and leads to increased fracture risk and
reduced efficiency of fracture repair that drastically decreases quality of life. Our previous studies showed that
an age-associated increase in chronic, low-grade inflammation is the main cause of skeletal stem and progenitor
cell (SSPCs) dysfunction. Thus, we hypothesize that reducing pro-inflammatory signals and enhancing anti-
inflammatory activity will rescue SSPC number and osteogenic function in aged individuals. To investigate this,
we will first precisely define the molecular mechanisms regulating the inflammatory response in SSPCs,
and the role of anti-inflammatory factors in the resolution of inflammation. We will determine how these
mechanisms and the interaction between opposing pro- and anti- inflammatory signals is affected by aging.
These experiments will generate insights into the elements driving bone degeneration and identify
therapeutic targets to improve bone health and fracture repair in elderly patients. Our strong preliminary
experiments also identified two prime suspects involved in SSPC deterioration during aging. We will perform
gain and loss of function experiments in SSPCs to elucidate their specific role in the control of stem cell
self-renewal and differentiation. As manipulation of these factors can affect the extracellular inflammatory
milieu, we will use single-cell RNA-sequencing to determine their cell-intrinsic function in SSPCs and also their
influence on defined populations within the local niche. Finally, we will manipulate candidate expression
following injury in aged animals to assess their ability to rescue stem cell regenerative capacity and
improve bone healing."

With the surge of large genomics data, there is an immense increase in the breadth and depth of different
genomics datasets and an increasing importance in the topic of privacy of individuals in genomic data science.
Detailed genetic and environmental characterization of diseases and conditions relies on the large-scale
mining of genotype-phenotype relationships; hence, there is great desire to share data as broadly as possible.
The recent change in NIH policy of sharing genomic summary results is a great step towards making the data
available to broader researchers. However, privacy studies inferring study participations is outdated compared
to the pace of the technological advancements in genome sequencing. A key first step in reducing private
information leakage is to measure the amount of information leakage, particularly under different scenarios. To
this end, we propose to derive information- theoretic measures for private information leakage in different
genomic data sharing scenarios, especially when the datasets are noisy and incomplete. We will also develop
various risk assessment tools. We will approach the privacy analysis under three aims. First, we will develop
statistical metrics that can be used to quantify the sensitive information leakage in different data sharing
scenarios as well as under the conditions when the genotype data is imperfect. We will systematically analyze
the risk of inference of study participation of a patient. Second, we will design a plausible privacy attack
through an experimental study, in which different technologies will be used to sequence genomes from trace
amount of samples such as touch objects or used glasses. This will allow us to study the plausible scenarios of
surreptious DNA testing and its effect on genomic data sharing. Third, we will develop risk assessment tools
for sharing genomic summary results. These tools will simulate hundreds of scenarios learned through
simulations in aim 1 and real-life privacy attacks in aim 2 to quantify the risks before the release of the data.
These tools will be implemented using cryptographic techniques to further reduce the private information
leakage during risk assessment step.
During the K99 phase, the aim of this project is to find minimum amount of genotyping information required and
maximum amount of noise tolerated for detection of a genome in a mixture using simulations and wet-lab
experiments. To accomplish this research goal, the K99 phase will involve training in molecular biology,
genomics and privacy. This training will take place at Yale University in the department of Molecular Biophysics
and Biochemistry, under the mentorship of Dr. Mark Gerstein (genomics and privacy) and Dr. Andrew Miranker
(molecular biology). Building on the training during the K99, the goal of the R00 phase will be simulation of the
results of the experimental training to increase the sample size and building privacy risk assessment tools with
the results learned from the experiment and simulations and implementation of such tools using cryptographic
techniques."

indices and little physical activity, sedentary behaviors and inadequate nutrition. These factors, which form a
toxic triangle of risk, are compounded by behavioral risks factors such as alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use

third largest AI tribe, will be living with Type 2 diabetes and 70% of the Nation will be obese. Wakaya: Rising
Up for Choctaw Youth Health, is an experiential, outdoor, nature-based program grounded in Choctaw values.
It is a multi-level intervention that integrates components of motivational interviewing, the information-
motivation-behavioral skills model, the Positive Youth Leadership Development framework, and the NIMHD
Multilevel Socio-Ecological Research Framework. With a prospective two-group randomized waitlist-control
trial design among 176 at-risk Choctaw youth (ages 14-18 years), we will assess the culturally grounded
intervention's impact on the primary outcomes of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and healthful food
habits; as well as the secondary outcomes of weight/BMI; and ATOD. Additionally, guided by the NIMHD
Multilevel Socioecological Framework, we will examine the potential mechanisms of change by analyzing how
pathway variables (e.g., nature connectedness) mediate intervention effects. Finally, through Topic Modeling of
qualitative interview data and Ripple Effect Mapping via youth participant and tribal leader focus groups (n=64),
we will explore the community-level impact of Wakaya and create a visual map representing the interconnected
ripple effects of the intervention into the community. The program, supported by promising preliminary data on
this approach among adults and acceptability data from youth, involves a 3-month outdoor intervention (with 4
individual sessions, weekly group sessions, 2 overnight culture immersion camps (7 days total), and a 4-day
Choctaw Trail of Tears walk. Additionally, the intervention builds youth health leadership and community
organizing skills. The research team comprises experts in American Indian health from academe as well as
Choctaw Nation and collaborative efforts among two tribal Departments- Historic Preservation and Behavioral
Health. Findings will be disseminated scientifically as well as shared with the tribe for programmatic
implementation. If efficacious, this intervention will provide evidence for interventions that promote physical
activity and nutrition programs that target green spaces, community gardens, natural/nature trails, and built
environments. The proposed study provides significant and practical information in several areas, including the
feasibility of delivering interventions in nature-based settings across multilevel stakeholders. Should it be
efficacious, the program has potential for widespread adaptation and dissemination to other tribal communities

10839828,"Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH)
PROJECT SUMMARY
Cerebral cavernous angioma (CA) is a capillary microangiopathy affecting more than a million Americans,
predisposing them to a premature risk of brain hemorrhage. Fewer than 200,000 cases who have suffered a
recent symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are most likely to re-bleed again with serious clinical sequelae, and are
the primary focus of therapeutic development. Genetic mechanisms of CA have been extensively studied, and
consequent signaling aberrations in the neurovascular unit. These include proliferative dysangiogenesis, blood-
brain barrier hyperpermeability, inflammation and immune mediated processes, anticoagulant vascular domain,
and gut microbiome-driven mechanisms. Plasma levels of molecules reflecting these mechanisms and measures
of vascular permeability and hemorrhage leak on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been correlated with
CA hemorrhage in pilot studies. It would be desirable to optimize these biomarkers to accurately diagnose CASH,
to prognosticate the risk of future SH, and to monitor cases after a bleed and in response to therapy. This would
influence clinical management, and select higher risk cases for clinical trials. Additional candidate biomarkers
are emerging from ongoing mechanistic and differential transcriptome studies, which would be expected to
further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and prediction of CASH. Weighed combinations of
levels of plasma proteins and characteristic micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA) may further strengthen biomarker
associations. Plasma biomarkers may reflect (and potentially replace) more cumbersome and expensive imaging
biomarkers for monitoring CA hemorrhage. We here assemble leading clinical CA researchers and propose to
deploy advanced statistical and computational biology approaches (including supervised machine learning) for
the integration of novel candidate biomarkers, rejecting non-correlated candidates, and determining the best
clustering and weighing of combined biomarker contributions. In Specific Aim 1 we assess these biomarkers in
a large CA cohort from multiple sites, to discover the best plasma biomarkers and validate them in sex, age and
relevant clinical subgroups. In Specific Aim 2 we compare changes in MRI measures of vascular permeability
and hemorrhage with plasma biomarkers over time. In Specific Aim 3 we query the biomarkers in non-CA
subjects, to identify potential confounders in the clinical context. This project leverages the synergy of established
CA research consortia, and integrates analytic and computational biology expertise to develop blood tests for
better CASH diagnosis and prognosis. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker
development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease with a relevant context of use. This approach
is applicable to other neurological diseases with similar pathobiologic features."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndrome (METS) are a major public health crisis affecting one in three
Americans. Though many treatments exist for these diseases, none target brain inflammation. This gap is
important because animal models show rapid induction of inflammation in metabolism regulating brain regions
such as the hypothalamus, particularly upon saturated fat exposure. Hypothalamic inflammation is a key cause
of chronic sympathetic nervous system (SNS) hyperactivity.
The SNS regulates most tissues through norepinephrine, a catecholamine neurotransmitter which binds  and
 adrenergic receptors (-AR). In T2D and METS, sympathetic nerves are hyperactive in many tissues,
including white adipose tissue. In healthy adipose tissue, sympathetic nerves drive lipolysis: the release of free
fatty acids, and the exogenous stimulation of this circuit clinically promotes glucose homeostasis. However, in
the disease state, adipose tissue downregulates -AR and exhibits impaired lipolysis in response to SNS input
(adipose catecholamine resistance). Chronically hyperactive sympathetic nerves could drive -AR
downregulation, but no data directly show this at present, which hampers approaches to restoring endogenous
catecholamine sensitivity and improving glucose homeostasis.
In the present study, we ablate somatostatinergic (SST) neurons, an endogenous anti-inflammatory cellular
population, in the paraventricular region of hypothalamus. This intervention induces both hypothalamic
inflammation and visceral adipose catecholamine resistance, but no detailed studies of insulin/glucose
homeostasis or sympathetic nerve activity have been performed in this model under chow or high fat diet
feeding. Thus, our central hypothesis is that the ablation of hypothalamic SST neurons (SST-DTA) will
exacerbate HFD induced visceral adipose catecholamine resistance and glucose intolerance by
increasing hypothalamic inflammation and adipose sympathetic nerve activity. This hypothesis makes
the prediction that SST-DTA drives adipose catecholamine resistance by increasing sympathetic nerve activity.
Thus, our objective is to elucidate the consequences of ablating hypothalamic somatostatinergic neurons on
adipose sympathetic nerve activity, adipose catecholamine resistance, and glucose homeostasis, under
normal diet and HFD. This is in line with the mission of the NIDDK because it addresses important basic and
translational aspects of the development of METS and T2D. As a result of the proposed studies, we expect to
develop novel targets in the regulation of SNS activity which should prove useful in restoring adipose tissue
sensitivity to catecholamines. Importantly, somatostatin analogues are already FDA approved and can target
the hypothalamus, which suggests our data could support a drug repurposing approach to treating
hypothalamic inflammation and restoring adipose tissue lipolytic function. Completion of this proposal will also
contribute to my training as a physician scientist through the acquisition of key techniques and essential skills."
10849987,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Individuals who smoke cigarettes with obesity (SWO) carry a disproportionate burden of tobacco-related
disease and death due to the interactive effects of smoking and excess weight. Smoking increases insulin
resistance and central adiposity (i.e., abdominal obesity), increasing the risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes,
and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Consequently, SWO have 10x the risk of mortality from CVD relative to
normal weight nonsmokers. SWO are more likely than normal weight smokers to report using cigarettes to
manage their weight, to be concerned about gaining weight post-cessation, to have less confidence in their
ability to manage their weight without cigarettes, and to resume smoking if they gain too much weight while
quitting. This can result in reduced likelihood of attempting to quit and limited success with cessation when a
quit attempt is made. Research has suggested that getting smokers who have not been able to quit smoking to
switch from combustible cigarettes to electronic cigarettes (EC) could reduce morbidity and mortality. While
FDA-approved nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is another option to facilitate changes in smoking,
adherence and acceptability tend to be low. In contrast, EC have been designed to deliver nicotine in bursts
that mimics smoking. Behaviorally and pharmacologically, EC may be a better substitute for smoking, leading
to higher compliance and helping to prevent cessation-related weight gain. While both NRT and EC may
reduce cigarette use in SWO, their efficacy, acceptability, and potential to limit weight gain and improve health
has not been compared among SWO. This research project (RP) will randomize 60 SWO to receive (1) EC, (2)
NRT, or (3) to a no-product control (CON) condition for 8 weeks. Assessments will occur at baseline, and 1, 2,
and 3-months follow-up. In a sample of SWO, aims include: 1) To compare EC, NRT, and CON on smoking,
exhaled carbon monoxide, and quit attempts; 2) To compare EC and NRT on acceptability and adherence; 3)
To compare EC, NRT, and CON effects on weight, central adiposity, glucose regulation, lipid metabolism,
inflammation, and blood pressure at follow-up. Prospective clinical studies are needed to understand whether
NRT or EC result in harm reduction by facilitating a switch from cigarettes to an alternate product, reducing
cigarette smoking, or by aiding in smoking cessation. This study will be the first to examine the effects of EC
and NRT on smoking and health among SWO. These findings add important knowledge about some of the
potential effects of EC and NRT use on use of combustible cigarettes and indicators of potential health harm in
a population highly vulnerable to smoking-related morbidity and mortality. The CADRE Cores will support the
successful completion of the RP and the investigator’s path to research independence. The REACH Core will
assist with remote participant recruitment, the CLC Core will provide clinical, technical, and scientific expertise
to aid with collection of biomarkers and data management/analysis, and the Admin Core will provide grants
management support along with mentoring, networking, didactic, and professional development opportunities."
10847605,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A mentor group of 12 senior, mid-level and young investigators, including 6 new members, each with
experience in training and with active and competitive research programs, propose to continue a Training
Program in Vision Science at the Medical College of Wisconsin for another 5 years. The request is for support
for 6 pre-doctoral trainees annually. The goal remains to prepare trainees for careers in vision research. This
requires that students have a broad appreciation of the major features of the visual system, a contemporary
understanding of the diseases that impact vision, and state-of-the-art skills for experimental work in the visual
system. It also requires that trainees acquire the analytical and communication skills necessary to succeed in a
multidisciplinary research environment. Our highly collaborative mentor group provides expertise in multiple
aspects of the visual system, including: the mechanisms of ocular disorders (ranging from early onset pediatric
phenotypes to adult onset degenerative disorders, diabetic retinopathy and myopia); development of diverse
disease models for functional studies; retinal circuitry and its development; gene therapy and editing; nuclear
magnetic resonance methods, with X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations; and ocular
coherence tomography and adaptive optics. Pre-doctoral trainees will complete a core curriculum including
fundamental topics in Molecular Genetics, Biochemistry, Neurobiology, Biophysics, Physiology and Cell Biology.
In addition, students receive training in “Instructional Program in the Responsible Conduct of Research” and
""The Biology of Vision"" as a prelude to conducting dissertation research. All students will have the opportunity
to enroll in the Clinical and Translational Science certificate program, which includes additional training in
translational research. All trainees in mentor labs will also participate in a monthly Vision Science Forum, the
Distinguished Lecture Series in Vision Science, an annual T32 Student Symposium and other events. New
features of the program include: a Young Investigator Seminar Series, uniquely designed to allow our trainees
to interact with trainees in other vision programs around the world; an annual off-campus Vision Science Retreat
uniting basic and clinical research performed at MCW; expanded opportunities for interactions with the clinical
enterprise; and an enhanced focus on modern approaches. Internal and External Advisory Committees (IAC and
EAC) will continue to provide additional guidance, and we are excited to resume their in-person visits that were
impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. The IAC will include some new members, including a senior graduate student
representative, further improving mentor-trainee communications and feedback as well as enhancing the overall
transparency of the program. In summary, we are committed to training a diverse cadre of PhDs and our
trainees are unquestionably prepared to lead successful careers in science. Our past record includes 40
pre-doctoral trainees, from which 12 hold faculty positions (8 in vision research), 13 developed successful non-
academic biomedical science careers, 6 are postdoctoral fellows and 7 are currently still in training."
10847676,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Support is requested for 12 optometry (OD) students per year to participate in short-term
training in vision research during the summer following successful completion of their
first year. The training will be conducted by established vision science and clinical science
researchers in the Herbert Wertheim School of Optometry and Vision Science.
The training program is designed to attract talented students to careers involving clinical
and/or translational research. Training will be provided within the laboratories of 26
mentors in the School, where currently 28 pre-doctoral Vision Science students and 21
postdoctoral fellows are involved in eye and vision-related research. The Vision Science
PhD graduate program is interdisciplinary, in existence for nearly 80 years, with the
majority of its graduates remaining actively engaged in research. Training is broad,
encompassing many disciplines among which are neuroscience, computational modeling,
psychology, molecular and cell biology, neurophysiology, immunology and infectious
diseases, with both basic science and clinical translational emphases.
By serving as hosts for T35 trainees, the Vision Science research community provide ideal
role models for trainees in line with the program goal of fostering interest in clinician
scientist careers. A wide range of basic science, as well as clinical research projects are on-
going in the laboratories of the mentors and open to trainees. To-date, this short-term
training program has provided for many clinicians a conduit to the Vision Science PhD
program, which has long been supported by a T32 Training Program grant.
Students attending Optometry schools from across the country are targets of our
recruitment efforts aimed at attracting a diverse pool of talented health professional
students to our program, with outreach to individual schools and to pre-Optometry career
education programs, e.g., Opto-camp, supplemented by web-based and social media
promotion. A recently added, zoom-based, research career-focused event will also be
made generally accessible, i.e., beyond the trainee cohort, to further support the
program's long-term goal of encouraging OD students to pursue advanced research
training and/or maintain involvement in research beyond their professional training."
10849895,"The goal of this K08 application is to provide Dr. Julia Carnevale, MD, with the skills she will 
need to become an independently-funded laboratory investigator studying novel ways to engineer T 
cells with more potent anti-tumor activity. There is intense clinical interest in improving 
adoptive T cell therapies to treat and cure more cancers. However, until recently there has been no 
way to efficiently and comprehensively evaluate the genome to find the critical gene networks that 
can be leveraged to program favorable human T cell behaviors. Dr. Carnevale recently developed a 
novel screening technology, sgRNA lentiviral infection with CAS9 electroporation (SLICE), that 
enables genome-wide CRISPR screening in primary human T cells to search for genes that regulate key 
therapeutic functions. Dr. Carnevale used SLICE to perform a genome-wide screen in T cells which 
identified a host of regulators of proliferation, many of which also enhanced T cell activation and 
in vitro cancer cell killing. She now proposes targeting top-raking genes from this screen, SOCS1 
and RASA2 (negative regulators of JAK/STAT and MAP kinase signaling, respectively), to improve the 
efficacy of adoptive T cell therapies. She hypothesizes that disruption of SOCS1 or RASA2 will 
enhance the anti-tumor properties of human T cells, that these genes can be targeted to improve 
adoptive T cell therapies, and that SLICE pooled screening can be performed in vivo to identify 
modifier gene targets that synergize with SOCS1 and RASA2 loss to improve tumor control. The 
specific aims of the proposed research are: 1) to test how SOCS1 and RASA2 influence T-cell 
responses  to  repeated  stimulation  and  explore  the  molecular  pathways  that  govern  these  
responses,  2)  to determine the effects of SOCS1 or RASA2 inactivation on antitumor activities of 
T cells in vivo, and 3) to identify gene targets that synergize with SOCS1 or RASA2 loss in vivo. 
Dr. Carnevale's training and research plans includes a combination of structured coursework and 
workshops, one-on-one tutorials, and hands-on research experience  that  will  all  take  place  at 
 UCSF,  a  world-renowned  academic  center  of  excellence  in  basic  and translational research. 
Dr. Carnevale's training plan will complement her existing expertise to build a strong foundation 
in the following areas: 1) fundamental T cell biology including the study of regulatory circuitry, 
function, and tumor immunity, 2) preclinical modeling of adoptive T cell therapies, and 3) 
next-generation sequencing methods and analysis including single-cell RNA sequencing. This project 
will be conducted under the mentorship of her primary mentor, Dr. Alan Ashworth, President of the 
UCSF Cancer Center and world expert in therapeutic discovery and translational research, and her 
co-mentor, Dr. Alex Marson, leading expert in genome engineering in immune cells. She will also 
receive extensive input from her distinguished advisory panel with complementary expertise to guide 
her research and career trajectory. At the completion of this award, Dr. Carnevale will have the 
relevant didactic and research experience to become a leader in discovering and developing 
next-generation adoptive T cell therapies for cancer patients."
10849897,"The University of Miami Miller School of Medicine is developing a new pre-doctoral training program in
translational immunology. We have assembled a group of 22 researchers that have highly active, well-funded,
and collaborative research programs to support state-of-the-art training in diverse topics related to translational
immunology. All mentors have active research programs in immunology related to autoimmunity, cancer, or
infectious diseases, major themes of this training grant. These Ph.D. and physician/scientist mentors are
distributed across disciplines and Departments at the School of Medicine, reflecting the wide applicability of
immunology throughout medicine, and are highly committed to training the next generation of scientists. This
training program seeks to fill many gaps in current graduate programs that do not adequately train individuals
to move research from bench to bedside. The Translational Immunology Training Program aims to enhance
the trainees' research experience by providing them with skills and experiences to advance the health
applications of their current and future research. Each trainee will perform research in a laboratory focusing on
one of the three themes of the program. To complement the intensive bench research, key unique elements of
the Translational Immunology Training Program are to expose the trainees to clinical medicine, to promote
interactions with clinicians, and to understand the health needs of patients with immune-related conditions.
This program is designed to provide each student with skills that will enhance their ability to pursue careers in
research/education that are directly geared at improving the health of patients with immune-related diseases or
other conditions that might benefit by immunotherapy. We recruit excellent and diverse students through our
Programs in Biomedical Sciences, a first-year umbrella program for our biomedical Ph.D. programs, where
most students are eligible to participate in a T32 sponsored training award. Thus, this proposed training grant
will provide dedicated funding for highly qualified students in translational Immunology, an area of strategic
importance to our School of Medicine and NIAID."
10853876,"Project Summary
Genetics and genomics have become increasingly important in research and medicine.
Moreover, with core tenets valuing variation, genetics and genomics must lead in the
appreciation and incorporation of diversity into biomedical research. In doing so, we must also
correct the demographic makeup of the research workforce, to more nearly represent the
diversity of the general population. We endorse that all levels of the research and clinical
workforce should have fundamental knowledge and skills in genetics and genomics and
understand its role in public health. These steps are necessary to reduce health inequities and
rebuild trust with historically underserved populations so that we may boost their enrollment in
research and incorporate genetics and genomics into their healthcare. To achieve this goal, we
will develop genomics educational modules (GEMs) for the entry-level medical and research
workforce. These modules will build on our recent experience developing and delivering an
online Genetic Assistant Training Program (GATP) to over 300 successful graduates. Using the
experience of our graduates of the GATP and input from a carefully selected Advisory
Committee of educators and employers, we will develop GEM content, best practices, and
workforce needs. The content of these modules will be devoted to the following topics: Genetics
& Genomics of Cardiovascular Conditions, Cancer, Reproductive Healthcare, Newborn Health,
Child Health, Laboratory Genomics, and Responsible Conduct of Research. Educational
content will include slide decks, recorded lectures, lab protocols, and assessments. We will
incorporate animations in education modules to boost engagement and we will build on the
educational principles of adult learning theory and universal design for learning to maximize
accessibility. We will develop, pilot, and refine existing and new GEMs targeted to students in
entry-level training programs at three Baltimore City partner sites that offer courses for
laboratory associates, medical assistants, and community health workers. These sites include
Baltimore’s BioTechnical Institute (BTI), the Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC)
Medical Assistant training program, and the Baltimore City Community College (BCCC)
Healthcare Workforce Development Program. These sites were selected given their dedication
to the community, and their support and enrollment of students that come from demographics
that are underrepresented in science. Ultimately, we will disseminate the GEMs at no cost on an
easily accessible website with the capability to be downloaded and used both nationally and
internationally."

This High End Instrumentation grant proposal seeks to replace the 7T MRI scanner that is currently operational
at the Lucas Center for Imaging (LCI) at Stanford University. The aforementioned scanner was one of the first
installed in the USA and been operational since 2006. Recently, the serviceability of this system, as well as
that of others sharing the same cryostat design, has been severely limited by the termination of this line of
products by their former manufacturer (Agilent Technologies, which had bought Magnex Scientific, the original
designer and service provider for the magnet). The proposed system will be provided by Siemens Medical
Systems, which now manufactures and services its new generation of actively shielded 7T magnets. In
addition, this new system is based on an FDA-approved platform, which will lessen the burden on patients
participating on our clinically driven research projects."
10853901,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarincomas (PDAC) is an aggressive disease with poor prognosis and is
characterized by a unique microenvironment that is severely depleted of amino acids (AAs). Dietary AA
interventions, such as serine/glycine (Ser/Gly)-free diet, can reduce PDAC tumor burden. However, PDAC cells
can regulate various pathways to adapt, grow and survive in response to AA starvation, including transcription,
mRNA translation, elongation, and the mRNA translation efficiencies (mTE) of codons. By regulating the mTE of
codons, PDAC cells allow selective mRNA translation that are required for the adaptation to nutrient poor
microenvironments of a tumor. Therefore, we propose that targeting the pathways that regulate the mTE of
codons can provide novel therapeutic avenues to improve the outcome of patients with PDAC and other cancers
 I previously found that Ser-deprivation decreases the mTE of two out of the six Ser codons, TCC and TCT
(TC[C/T]), to selectively suppress and promote the synthesis of TC[C/T]-rich and -poor genes, respectively.
Interestingly, TC[C/T]-poor genes are significantly enriched in adaptive pathways required for survival, such as
cell cycle, transcription, and secreted factors. Whereas suppression of TC[C/T]-rich proteins can promote
immune escape. By blocking the mTE differences in Ser-deprived conditions, we would be able to prevent the
activation of multiple adaptive pathways that are required for survival upon Ser-limitation in PDAC tumors.
However, the mechanism(s) that regulate the mTE of Ser codons in response to Ser-limitation are not known.
 My research focus is to decipher the regulation, effects, and role of human Ser codons on mRNA translation
during PDAC tumorigenesis, and to harness these findings to identify novel therapeutic strategies in the
treatment of PDAC and other cancers. Using a whole genome CRISPR screen, we have already identified
ELAC2, a 3' pre-tRNA processing enzyme, as a key mTE regulator of Ser-codons in PDAC cells starved of Ser.
Here, we will elucidate the upstream signaling cascade(s) that sense Ser-starvation to alter the mTE of Ser
codons, determine the downstream mechanism(s) that control mTE differences, and to assess the importance
of mTE regulation of Ser codons during PDAC tumorigenesis.
 By elucidating the upstream signaling cascades, downstream mechanisms, and functions in detail, we will
gain a comprehensive understanding of the role of human Ser codons on mRNA translation in response to the
nutrient environment during PDAC tumorigenesis. We will identify multiple therapeutic strategies to block mTE
differences that allow the activation of Ser codon-driven adaptive pathways during PDAC tumorigenesis. This
work also will reveal mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of other human genetic diseases, such as
intellectual disabilities associated with ELAC2 and TPRKB mutations. A comprehensive understanding of the
roles of Ser codons on mRNA translation in response to the nutrient environment can establish a new paradigm
“tumor nutrient-codon preferences” as an Achilles' heel during the tumorigenesis of PDAC and other cancers."

We are requesting a Leica STELLARIS 8 FALCON laser scanning confocal microscope for the microscopy facility
in the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public
Health, which is part of the Johns Hopkins Medical Campus. A unique feature of our facility is the ability to perform
live cell imaging experiments with biological agents that require Biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) containment, including
human pathogens, such as Influenza A virus, Cryptococcus neoformans, Borrelia burgdorferi, Listeria
monocytogenes, Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii. The proposed instrument will represent the
first confocal microscope for this facility and within the current space restrictions will be singularly capable of
supporting the various advanced confocal microscopy needs of our users. Notable features that convinced us
during testing are its Wight Light Laser, translating into 350 laser lines, its imaging speed and the capacity to
detect up to five different fluorophores simultaneously, while offering the gentle imaging conditions needed for
live microscopy at confocal resolution. TauSense and FALCON enable the harnessing of fluorescence lifetime-
based information and with this provide additional image quality, the ability to separate overlapping fluorophores
and state-of-the-art measurements of protein interactions via FLIM-FRET. Altogether, the addition of this
instrument to our facility will significantly enhance NIH-funded projects of our users and greatly contribute to the
infectious disease focus and other key research areas of our institution."

Signal transduction is a universal biological process vital to all organisms. Due to their central role in disease,
signal transduction systems in humans and in bacterial pathogens are the primary targets for drug design. Our
long-term goal is to understand how cells detect, transmit, and adapt to signals. The main focus of our research
is on bacterial signal transduction systems, with the goal of revealing their fundamental properties and
mechanisms at the molecular level. The main unanswered questions that we propose to address are: (1) Which
small molecule ligands are recognized by bacteria; (2) How did signaling networks evolve; and 3) Can we use
the knowledge obtained with bacterial systems to advance our understanding of their counterparts in humans,
especially with respect to disease. We propose to build on our previous findings and capitalize on our tools and
innovative approaches to obtain and capture this knowledge as predictive models. These models will be stored
in public databases, such as InterPro, NCBI Conserved Domain database, and our own Microbial Signal
Transduction (MiST) database. Current MiST capabilities will be further enhanced to better serve the scientific

 Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a severe impairment of arterial vessels resulting in obstruction of normal
blood flow in the legs, leading to acute or chronic lower limb ischemia and subsequently high morbidity and
mortality rates. Common treatments for PAD, such as medications and surgical revascularization, have several
limitations. For instance, medications used to lower cholesterol, reduce high blood pressure, control blood sugar,
prevent blood clots, and relieve symptoms like leg pains may delay onset. Still, they cannot treat the established
disease directly and often cause side effects, including bleeding, headache, and diarrhea. Meanwhile, many
elderly PAD patients cannot undergo surgical options. Therefore, it is vital to develop an alternative therapy to
treat PAD. Our long-term goal is to develop novel degradable dual-modal imaging nanoparticles (DINPs) to
precisely deliver therapeutic reagents that provide cell protection and facilitate the formation of blood vessels de
novo at ischemic sites while allowing detection of the NP location and monitoring of their therapeutic
effectiveness for PAD treatment. We have three specific aims: (1) To synthesize, characterize and optimize our
biodegradable dual-modal fluorescent/photoacoustic elastomers named biodegradable photoluminescent
polymers-aniline tetramers (BPLPAT), (2) To formulate and analyze DINPs made of optimized BPLPATs and
loaded with therapeutic reagents for facilitating cell protection and angiogenesis, and (3) To evaluate the
effectiveness of DINPs to treat PAD in vivo using animal models. Innovative aspects of this research are i) the
use of our novel BPLPAT material allowing both fluorescent and deep-tissue photoacoustic imaging opportunities
to detect the in vivo distribution of these NPs and evaluate their degradation assessment; ii) development of
DINPs based on recent advances in nanotechnology and tissue engineering providing a unique strategy to
deliver new therapeutic agents to the ischemic site in order to enhance cellular protection and promote
angiogenesis in situ under hypoxic conditions such as ischemic tissues. The rigor of prior research and
scientific feasibility of our developed DINPs are well-established as we have already demonstrated (1) their
detectability via both fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging, (2) the retention of DINPs loaded with therapeutic
agents at the ischemic zones, (3) the release of therapeutic compounds in a sustained manner, and (4) their
capacity to provide cell protection and promote angiogenesis to recover blood perfusion after ischemia. The
success of our research will provide a novel therapy for the effective treatment of PAD."

Pediatric cancers are generally quite different than adult cancers. For example, pediatric cancers exhibit unique
oncogenic mechanisms, often reflective of aberrant developmental pathways. Thankfully, pediatric cancers are
rare, and so the field must rely more strongly on cooperation, collaboration, and team-science to enable scientific
progress and translation to the clinic. These realities, when combined with an insufficient research workforce,
necessitate the development of a specifically-designed training program for pediatric oncology research.
The overarching goal of the “Training Program in Basic and Translational Pediatric Oncology Research” is
to provide postdoctoral and graduate student trainees with the requisite skills and expertise to develop into
successful researchers focused on pediatric oncology. The Training Program is centered at the Abigail Wexner
Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, a world-renowned pediatric research hospital environment,
and also leverages the strengths of The Ohio State University as an academic partner. Training includes strong
mentorship in laboratory-based basic and translational research with newly-developed program-specific
classwork, a broad palette of elective classwork, thoughtful training in career-development, team science, and
relationship-building, and a clinical exposure plan to enable trainees to better appreciate the impact of their work
on patients, families, and clinical teams.
This new application seeks 6 training slots per year: 3 postdoctoral fellows and 3 graduate students. Trainees
will generally spend 2 years in the Training Program. Postdoctoral trainees include Pediatric Heme/Onc/BMT
MD (or MD/PhD) fellows and PhD (or MD/PhD) postdoctoral trainees. Graduate students are drawn from one
of three graduate programs at The Ohio State University. A well-constructed trainee selection plan with a focus
on diversity will ensure that the trainees who enter the Training Program have a high-likelihood for success in
their ultimate entry into the field of pediatric cancer research.
Finally, the Training Program includes a thoughtful logic model as a framework for program evaluation and
continuous improvement cycles. The trainees, the mentors, and the Training Program itself will all be subjected
to rigorous evaluation by our External and Internal Advisory Boards, consisting of individuals with key areas of
expertise and focus, to ensure that the Training Program continues to evolve as training needs evolve.
Overall, the Training Program in Basic and Translational Pediatric Oncology Research will expand highly-
skilled pediatric oncology research and improve its collaborative potential to transform the care of children with
cancer."
10841538,"Abstract
The immune system is composed of many heterogeneous cell types that respond in a synergistic
manner to mount both immediate and long-lived immunity against pathogens. The complexity of
the immune system necessitates an integrated view of multiple biological modalities to understand
different roles of varying cell types of the immune system. Detailed transcriptomic and protein
analysis at the single cell level is essential to follow the immune system’s response to pathogens
in mounting an antigen specific response. With heavy emphasis on assays that facilitate the
analysis of antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses, the Integrative Multi-Omics
Core will serve as a resource to standardize, optimize, and perform multi-omic single cell research
to support the biological research objectives of Projects 1, 2 and 3. The implementation of highly
standardized and automated assays will enable longitudinal and cross-sectional analysis of the
human samples within and across the research projects. Specifically, the core will provide: i.
standardized high throughput flow cytometry, bulk transcriptomics and plasma proteomics; ii. well
established synergistic assays for the analysis of antigen-specific T cell and B cell responses,
including several orthogonal approaches for profiling antigen-specific T cells and a range of
systems serology assays; and iii. optimized cost-efficient single-cell sequencing multi-omics
methods for analysis of cellular protein-expression, gene-expression, adaptive receptor
sequences, antigen-specificity, and epigenomics based on the 10x Genomics platform.
Furthermore, we will use a collaborative cloud environment to support data ingest, processing
and provision to the DMAC for deposition into ImmPort in support of rapid public access and
innovation in data integration and visualization."

enhanced potency and durability of immune responses following immunization with a soluble
native-like Env trimer formulated with different adjuvants, 2) evaluation of lymph node germinal
cell activities and B cell function and phenotype that have the potential to initiate development of
HIV-1 broad neutralizing antibodies, and 3) advance high-throughput systems to interrogate the
HIV-specific T cell repertoire following vaccination and identify profiles that may associate with
immune protection in partially efficacious vaccine trials. Embedded in these studies will be
selected analyses of response signatures in unique tissue sources and in diverse populations.
These investigations will accelerate progress toward an effective vaccine by probing innate and
adaptive immune responses at an unprecedented level in humans."
10841542,"HIPC3 Scientific Project 3: Immune response to SARS-CoV-2 natural infection followed by vaccination
Abstract
This project will characterize the innate and adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 natural infection in the
setting of mild disease and follow-on vaccination. We will define signatures correlating with reduced viral
shedding, progression to PASC or long COVID, and magnitude of adaptive immune responses in
convalescence and after vaccination. Our approach uses cutting-edge multi-omic single-cell technologies to
dissect the innate and adaptive immune response and identify correlates of protection, vaccine response, and
PASC. We will 1. Define the innate immune response during acute infection and test the hypothesis that
interindividual variation in viral shedding duration is partly regulated by differences in innate response. These
analyses will also include diverse participants to identify potential contributions by race/ethnicity. 2. Track the
evolution and kinetics of T cell responses to natural infection and follow-on vaccination. We hypothesize that
specific targeted epitopes and phenotypes will be more protective in short viral shedding, and that vaccines
induce unique, protective T cells that are not found in the convalescent repertoire. These studies will also
identify key helper T cell phenotypes for mounting robust humoral and cellular responses to natural infection
and vaccine. These signatures will also be correlated with innate immune signatures to identify innate-adaptive
coordination events 3. Characterize the immune response throughout infection and convalescence in PASC.
Innate and adaptive immunity will be analyzed from acute infection through convalescence to understand how
inflammation and antiviral response trajectories may differ in PASC compared to successful recovery. These
will enable hypotheses on the causal mechanisms of PASC and therapeutic targets from ongoing pathogenic
mechanisms. These results will enable improved clinical outcomes, treatment of existing PASC patients, and
can guide vaccine developments and boosters. Overall, our longitudinal analysis will associate immune
responses throughout disease to concrete functional outcomes including duration of viral shedding, PASC, and
vaccine response."

Large-data management systems and computational analysis approaches to immunological research must be
able to handle high-throughput, multiparametric assay technologies, which pose unique data management and
analysis challenges. Building upon our past work in the Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC),
including the ImmuneSpace HIPC web portal and data resource, this proposal aims to establish an
infrastructure that will streamline data analysis and integration – across research centers and across assay
types – across the different scientific projects of this proposal, thus helping achieve more meaningful biological
insights into their motivating questions. Our Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) will provide data
management and associated services required to support the scientific projects of this proposal in three ways.
First, we will develop pipelines for importing, annotating, pre-processing, and standardizing immunological
assay data to enable data analysis and for deposition into our data management system. These pipelines will
utilize existing tools where appropriate; tools will be modified and/or new tools will be developed, when
needed. In addition, we will strive to use collaborative, open-source tools. Second, utilizing these pipelines, we
will develop a central data management system for data collection, storage, and sharing. The system will be
built around the DataPackageR R package that we have developed, and will track data processing as a
separate step from statistical analysis. Third, we will provide study design and statistical/computational support
for the different research projects of this proposal. These efforts are particularly important for ensuring high
sensitivity and specificity to detect e.g. vaccine-induced immune responses and for quantifying these
responses with maximal accuracy, reproducibility, and signal-to-noise ratios. By achieving the aims of this
grant, unprocessed raw data from diverse labs and immunological assay technologies will be able to be quality
controlled, annotated in a standardized fashion, formatted for downstream analysis and modeling, and finally
stored on a shared and highly secure infrastructure, providing a seamless and highly reproducible workflow
that bolsters the quality of the scientific analyses."
10861032,"Nearly 900,000 Veterans were dispensed opioid medication at the prescribing peak in 2012, with rates of
opioid prescribing in VA subsequently declining year-over-year to fewer than 700,000 Veterans dispensed
opioid medication in 2016. These downward trends are likely to continue with more widespread implementation
of the VA Opioid Safety Initiative, additional efforts at local VA hospitals to enhance opioid risk mitigation and
safe opioid prescribing practices, and recently released CDC and VA/DoD opioid prescribing guidelines that
discourage long-term opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain. Despite steady rates of opioid discontinuation
in VA, little is known about consequences—both positive and negative—of opioid discontinuation. The
objectives of this study are to characterize patients’ experiences with the opioid discontinuation process,
identify ways patients subsequently manage their pain through the use of VA and non-VA resources, and
examine patient-centered outcomes such as quality of life, pain, substance use, and mental health symptom
severity following opioid discontinuation. This prospective cohort study will enroll 1,144 VA patients randomly
selected from the population of VA patients prescribed long-term opioid therapy. All patients will complete 5
mailed or online survey assessments at baseline, 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month follow-up that assess quality of
life, pain, substance use, and mental health symptoms. Additional clinical and pharmacy data will be extracted
from patients’ VA electronic health record. We will monitor patients in the cohort for reductions in opioid dose
and complete opioid discontinuation. Patients who discontinue opioid therapy will complete an additional
survey to assess acute patient outcomes following opioid discontinuation. A subset of 40 patients who
discontinue opioid therapy will participate in semi-structured interviews over the telephone immediately
following discontinuation, as well as 6- and 12 months post-discontinuation. Interviews will ascertain patients’
experiences with the opioid discontinuation process, pain treatment approaches utilized within and external to
VA, and patient outcomes following discontinuation. This study has three specific aims: (1) compare acute
(immediate), intermediate (6-month), and long-term (12-month) quality of life and pain outcomes between
patients who discontinue versus those who remain on long-term opioid therapy (LTOT), (2) test the moderating
effect of gender and race/ethnicity on changes in quality of life and pain outcomes between patients who
discontinue versus those who remain on LTOT, and (3) use qualitative methods to augment quantitative
findings on patient quality of life and pain outcomes, identify patient experiences with the opioid discontinuation
process, and characterize the impact of discontinuation on patient-clinician relationships. The integration of
results from quantitative and qualitative data analyses will characterize patient experiences with, and outcomes
following, opioid discontinuation. This study is both timely and highly relevant to current national VA priority
goals of (1) Pain and Use of Opioids and (2) Care in Community Networks. Specifically, this study will provide
VA operations administrators, hospital executives, and clinicians with information that characterizes opioid
discontinuation from patients’ perspectives. These perspectives can inform best practices for discontinuing
opioid therapy, when clinically indicated, while simultaneously mitigating negative consequences of
discontinuation and engaging and empowering patients to manage chronic pain with evidence-based non-
opioid treatment modalities available within VA and in the community."

Tumor associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) are aberrant glycosylation products that are expressed on
cancer cells but absent on most normal cells. Their expression is typically associated with metastasis, poor
prognosis, and reduced overall survival. Tn antigen (N-acetylgalactosamine O-linked to a serine or threonine) is
a TACA often found on cancer mucins. We have investigated the regulation of B cell responses to Tn- and other
TACA-bearing mucins using a mouse model. Our progress has shown that specificities for TACAs, including Tn,
are highly enriched in the innate B (B1) cell population in mice. We have also found that B cell-intrinsic PD-1
expression potently suppresses tumor-protective TACA-specific antibody (Ab) responses and that CD4+ cells
are required for the increased responses that are observed in the context of PD-1 inhibition. Finally, we identified
a Tn-specific IgM monoclonal Ab that has significant and broad anti-tumor activity in vivo. Our understanding of
the mechanisms regulating Ab responses to Tn and other TACAs is very limited. Similarly, our understanding of
the mechanisms by which these Abs effectively kill cancer cells is incomplete. These critical gaps in knowledge
must be filled in order to harness the protective capacity of TACA-reactive B cells and the Abs that they produce.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that B cells with natural specificities for TACAs play a critical role in
the effective anti-tumor immune response to cancers. Our key objectives are to: 1) Determine the mechanisms
by which CD4+ T cells support TACA-specific Ab responses and the extent to which PD-1 inhibition alters the
diversity of the Tn-specific B cell response (Aim 1), 2) Identify the mechanisms by which Tn-specific IgM
promotes both tumor cell killing and adaptive anti-tumor immune responses (Aim 2), and 3) Examine the
repertoire of Tn-specific B cells in humans and identify broadly reactive Tn-specific Abs with tumor-killing
potential (Aim 3). The findings emanating from these studies are expected to reveal novel opportunities to 1)
harness the anti-tumor potential of B cells with specificities for cancer-expressed glycans and 2) leverage
broadly-reactive TACA Abs for their ability to promote highly specific adaptive and dynamic immune responses
targeting TACA-associated peptides."
10853286,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Today, functional MRI (fMRI) is the most widely-used method for measuring activity across the entire human
brain. FMRI is used to infer ‘functional connectivity’, and most studies utilize coarse spatial resolution (~2 mm
isotropic) with which it is possible to detect interactions between brain areas at the centimeter scale. However,
this approach lacks the ability to estimate the directionality of neuronal communication flowing from one brain
area to another, and thus cannot decipher the underlying circuitry needed to investigate brain computation.
Meanwhile, the emerging field of laminar fMRI seeks to resolve activation patterns across cerebral cortical layers,
and has shown the potential to interrogate the directionality of these connections by probing correlations between
input and output layers of cortical areas. Yet even with the highest spatial resolutions available at 7 Tesla (0.8
mm isotropic), laminar fMRI data are marginally capable of isolating the activity of individual cortical layers and
are incapable of covering the entire brain with adequate temporal resolution. Here we propose to supplement
conventional whole-brain functional connectivity with an ultra-high spatial resolution (0.125 mm) interrogation of
cortical laminar connectivity. Our technology automatically places multiple independent 1D “linescan” fMRI
acquisitions normal to the cortical surface within functional ‘hubs’ identified in a prior conventional fMRI scan.
 Linescan MRI is a classic method that acquires a “1D image”—i.e., a single line—enabling ultra-high spatial
resolution in the “in-line” direction down to ~100 μm. Since only one line is encoded, it also enables short
readouts and ultra-fast temporal resolution. Linescan MRI is well-suited to cortical layers, provided that the line
intersects the cortex exactly perpendicularly. Accurate manual prescription of one linescan at a given location in
human cerebral cortex is difficult with the MRI console’s user interface; prescribing several linescans across a
brain network is prohibitive. Also, linescans cannot be retrospectively corrected for motion. We will overcome
these challenges to enable concurrent linescan fMRI at multiple cortical locations to study communication along
feedforward and feedback pathways between cortical areas. We will also develop novel radiofrequency pulses
to sharpen the ‘line profiles’ to increase resolution and boost SNR. We will develop both novel gradient-echo
linescan fMRI to provide ultra-fast temporal resolution and spin-echo linescan fMRI to provide pure T2 contrast—
difficult to attain with conventional fMRI—for microvascular weighting and increased neuronal specificity. We will
apply our linescan fMRI in experiments designed to showcase its unique capabilities and advantages. We will
extend previous findings by measuring layer-specific interactions between left and right motor cortex, then
demonstrate, for the first time, how input layers and the cascade of information across visual cortex can be
inferred from the onset time of the layer-specific activation, and test a novel hypothesis about directed
communication within the Default Mode Network. The outcomes will be dissemination of data acquisition/analysis
technologies that expand the scope of what is possible with fMRI, and novel insights into human brain circuitry."
10861048,"ABSTRACT
 Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can be a lifesaving treatment for patients with
hematologic disease. It is also one of the most life-altering treatments, given the high risks of morbidity and
mortality, and requiring extensive commitments of money, time, and effort. Following a protracted inpatient stay
and initial successful engraftment of healthy cells, patients return to their homes where they must follow a
complex medical regimen that requires the help of a family caregiver to reduce their risk of infection and other
threats to long term treatment success. Adherence to the regimen by the patient and family caregiver,
however, is a significant clinical problem. Evidence-based interventions to help patients and their family
caregivers manage the many challenges of the post-HCT regimen together are urgently needed but have
received little research attention. To address this need, we have developed a dyadic problem-solving therapy
(DPST-HCT) intervention to help HCT patients and their family caregivers manage the post-HCT medical
regimen as a team. The planned research will make use of a combination of qualitative and quantitative
methods iteratively within a user-centered design approach to refine the intervention and provide evidence of
acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy. In Stage 1, we will conduct focus groups and incorporate patient, family
caregiver, and health care professional feedback on medical management challenges and the usefulness of
the intervention. In Stage 2, we will interatively refine the intervention with a small number of patient-family
caregiver dyads, resulting in a finalized intervention. In Stage 3, we will evaluate the final version of the DPST-
HCT in a single-site randomized controlled trial to determine acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy. We will
randomize 104 newly transplanted allogeneic HCT patient-family caregiver dyads (N=208) to the DPST-HCT
arm or Enhanced Usual Care comparison arm and assess study outcomes at 1-, 5-, 12-, and 24-weeks post-
intervention completion. We will (a) determine process considerations (acceptability, feasibility); (b) provide an
initial test of intervention efficacy on primary outcomes (dyadic team-based management: adherence and self-
efficacy), and secondary outcomes (patient and family caregiver well-being, perceived health, health-related
quality of life, patient clinical events, and patient health care utilization. Anticipated results will provide further
support for a dyadic team-based approach to post HCT medical regimen management and serve as the basis
for a multi-site RCT to test DPST-HCT."

The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has been rising dramatically in Western populations over
the last several decades. EAC arises from Barrett’s esophagus (BE), a specialized intestinal metaplasia of the
esophagus associated with chronic acid reflux. Patients with BE are recommended to undergo periodic
endoscopic screening, in which biopsies are obtained along the BE-lined esophagus to detect progression to EAC.
Here, the goal is to detect the presence of neoplasia, and if present, to categorize the lesion as low-grade dysplasia
(LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or cancer (EAC), all of which have unique treatment implications.
Unfortunately, there is high inter-pathologist disagreement in distinguishing between LGD and HGD. In particular,
LGD is notoriously difficult to diagnose by histopathology, and has variable progression rates to HGD and/or EAC.
Therefore, there is a need to improve our methods for obtaining a definitive diagnosis and treatment
recommendation based on endoscopic biopsies. A significant contributing factor to this problem is that
pathological grading (risk assessment) of esophageal biopsies currently relies upon the subjective interpretation
of 2D sections that only represent ~1% of the total volume of the biopsies. Our team at the Univ. of Washington
(UW), the Fred Hutch Cancer Center (FHCC), and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) is pioneering the
development of non-destructive 3D pathology and associated computational methods (2D and 3D) for clinical
decision support. Non-destructive 3D pathology has the potential to greatly improve diagnostic determinations by
enabling: (1) orders-of-magnitude greater sampling of tissue specimens, (2) volumetric imaging of cell
distributions, tissue structures, and other novel 3D spatial biomarkers that are prognostic/predictive, and (3) non-
destructive imaging, which preserves valuable tissues (e.g. whole biopsies) for downstream molecular assays.
Over the past few years, we have conducted a series of studies to evaluate our nondestructive 3D pathology
methods for the diagnosis and grading of BE-related lesions (LGD, HGD, and EAC). We have demonstrated the
ability of 3D pathology to elucidate esophageal lesions that are ambiguous with conventional 2D histology. We
have also developed deep-learning-assisted pipelines to analyze massive 3D pathology datasets for
prognostication of cancer outcomes. Here, we will continue to refine these collective technologies to improve the
treatment and outcomes for patients with BE. Our project goals include: Aim 1 (standardization and quality control)
– to develop a 3D pathology pipeline to enable reproducible (>95% yield) generation of clinical-grade 3D datasets;
Aim 2 (AI triage to assist pathologists) – to develop weakly supervised deep-learning triage methods, based on
annotated 2D image levels within 3D pathology datasets, for time-efficient pathologist interpretation of 3D
pathology datasets; and Aim 3 (AI decision support) – to develop weakly supervised deep learning, based on
patient outcomes, for fully computational risk stratification of putative low-grade patients."

Cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for single particle analysis has taken the fields of biological sciences
and structural biology by storm, leading to breakthroughs in our understanding of many key biological
processes. Cryo-EM has emerged as the primary approach for macromolecular structure determination to
visualize large protein assemblies that are not amenable to conventional structural biology approaches (e.g.,
NMR and X-ray crystallography). Unfortunately, researchers in Kansas do not have direct access to cryo-EM
instruments at their institutions and regional access is severely limited. Therefore, many eligible investigators
have not pursued cryo-EM, and ones that have are often dependent on distant cryo-EM facilities and/or busy
NIH supported national centers. When considering that iterative sample preparation optimization is required,
the absence of local cryo-EM poses significant barriers for regional scientists wishing to utilize this technology.
This challenge facing Kansas investigators is emblematic of that facing investigators in other IDeA-designated
states where cryo-EM is markedly underrepresented. Our plan is to establish a Midwest regional cryo-EM
facility to meet needs of researchers in Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and beyond. We request funds for a Glacios
200 kV cryo-TEM equipped with the Falcon 4i Detector and a Selectris energy filter. The University of Kansas
Medical Center executed a no-obligation-to-buy lease agreement with Thermo Fisher for installation of the
Glacios system to satisfy the immediate needs of 12 major users and 7 minor users. Significant institutional
resources have been committed to this project including financial investments, infrastructure renovations,
facility staff support, and programs to raise awareness and promote preliminary data acquisition. The 200 kV
Glacios with the Falcon 4i and Selectris imaging filter is an ideal cryo-EM platform with a proven track record.
This system will not only provide excellent screening abilities for high-resolution analysis at NIH supported
cryo-EM national facilities, but also will serve as a stand-alone instrument for single particle analysis for
medium to high-resolution structures. In this way, the system will serve multiple functions and maximize the
benefits to the region. It will integrate into existing structural biology infrastructure and strengths of the region.
KUMC’s proximity to multiple institutions with users needing cryo-EM including KU, Wichita State, Kansas
State University, Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Creighton University, and the University of Iowa,
make it an ideal location to serve a large number of regional users. S10 support for the KUMC Glacios will
meaningfully advance a sizable number of regional research programs while synergizing with national centers
to improve overall workflow in meeting the needs of NIH-funded research in the US."
10842591,"Summary
Intracellular environments are constantly producing local stress in the form of aging organelles or accumulations
of redundant or misfolded components. During disease, these processes are exacerbated as, for example,
pathogen invasion contributes another source of cytoplasmic toxicity. Our cells deal with these various
challenges by creating a new organelle called the autophagosome which grows around the intracellular toxin
and eventually fully encapsulates it. In this way, the dying organelle or the invading virus is sequestered from
the rest of the cytoplasm. A similar process plays out when cells are starving, as autophagosomes can be used
to harvest redundant material as a source of nutrients. Each autophagosome requires millions of lipids to
complete its construction and in high stress, hundreds of autophagosomes may be made over tens of minutes.
In just the last four years, my lab and several others in the field, have discovered the primary machinery needed
to harvest most or all of the lipids involved in autophagosome construction. This machinery includes a lipid
transporter and associated transmembrane proteins that distribute these lipids to both leaflets of the connecting
membranes.
This “bulk lipid transport” system is unprecedented and thus its discovery has raised many important next
questions. Most critically, we know which machines harvest the lipids, but we do not understand how the lipids
are pulled from their source membrane. We also do not have an absolute understanding of which membrane is
the source. These two questions are closely connected as the ability to flux lipids out of a membrane is probably
related to physico-chemical attributes of the donor membrane. In addition, the decision to flux potentially
100,000,000's of lipids out of a donor may impact the normal biology at that site and so we need to understand
how autophagosome biogenesis is coupled to changes in the lipid donor membrane compartment.
The other surprising element of autophagosomes is their shape. They need to adopt a bowl-like structure in
order to encapsulate random bits of cytoplasm during starvation. How this occurs is not known, but several
models have postulated that the harvesting of lipids alone might suffice, while others suggest key proteins that
recognize extreme elements of this unique-shape will stabilize those elements driving the production of bowls.
In this proposal, we build on our recent discoveries to explore where lipids are harvested from, how the flux is
generated and then ask how these two activities are coupled to the formation of the bowl-like intermediates in
autophagosome biogenesis."
10842697,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Live cell imaging has revolutionized the study of dynamic cellular processes, enabling researchers to gain
valuable functional insights that would be impossible to obtain from static images. The recent advances in
microscopy technology have made it possible to acquire an unprecedented amount of live cell image data at
high spatiotemporal resolutions. However, this abundance of data has brought new challenges, particularly
concerning phenotypic and causal heterogeneity. This heterogeneity can complicate the analysis and
interpretation of the data, making it challenging to identify critical mechanistic details and understand how
cellular processes function in different conditions. To address this issue, we have been developing machine
learning platforms that can deconvolve the heterogeneity of live cell images at subcellular and cellular levels.
However, there are still many challenges in analyzing live cell heterogeneity in greater detail. First,
conventional feature selection/learning that aids in classifying known phenotypes could eliminate biologically
meaningful heterogeneity. Second, current cell biology research focuses primarily on mechanisms that
produce similar average effects across various populations, which could suffer from causal heterogeneity.
Even with the significant progress made in single-cell biology, the discovery of causal mechanisms at the
single-cell resolution is still not fully achieved. Finally, the substantial heterogeneity in cell motility and
morphodynamics poses a challenge to obtaining integrated and systematic understandings of these
processes, despite their clear significance in fields such as tissue regeneration and cancer metastasis. To
overcome these challenges, we propose to advance current machine learning methods to i) identify features
that preserve subtype heterogeneity while being discriminative between known phenotypes, ii) acquire causal
datasets of live cell images by tracking cells before and after optogenetic treatment, and iii) deconvolve the
causal heterogeneity of single live cells by integrating time-series modeling and deep learning. We will apply
these methods to map out single-cell mechanisms governing cellular motility and morphodynamics of various
cell types, which will be valuable resources for the cell biology community. Then, we will characterize how
mechanical and metabolic perturbations can shape the heterogeneous landscapes of cell motility and
morphodynamics, providing new insights into the underlying mechanisms integrating these processes."

The primary objectives of Project 3 are to optimize the vaginal film delivery system for the Human
Contraception Antibody (HCA) and to perform assays to assess PK/PD and safety endpoints in
vaginal samples from women in the clinical trials. Vaginal film optimization will be conducted by
Dr. Rohan at the University of Pittsburgh. The first step will be to optimize the immediate-release
film that will be used in the clinical trials; Dr. Rohan will oversee transfer of film production to KBio,
the company that will manufacture the GMP HCA film. The next step will be the development of
an extended-release film that will deliver contraceptive antibody for > 3 days. Antibody studies for
the film optimization work and for the clinical PK/PD trial will be conducted in Dr. Anderson’s
laboratory. Both HCA antibody concentration and activity will be assessed. In addition, Dr.
Anderson’s laboratory will evaluate safety endpoints in women enrolled in the clinical trials. The
Specific Aims of Project 3 are:
1) Develop improved vaginal film formulations for immediate and extended HCA release.
2) Evaluate exploratory PK/PD endpoints using innovative assays that measure HCA
 concentrations and activity in vaginal samples before and after film use.
3) Assess exploratory safety endpoints (vaginal inflammation, changes in the vaginal
 microbiome and gene expression pathways, de novo development of antisperm immunity)
 in women before and after HCA film use.
We expect that data from these experiments will guide decisions concerning critical parameters
of product format, safety and dose that will be invaluable for the progression of ZB-06 through
clinical trials and commercialization."

10924055,"The goal of this project is to characterize the presence and correlates of cognitive decline, mild cognitive
impairment [MCI] and dementia in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) cohort.
Numerous epidemiologic studies have shown that pre-diabetes (PreD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are associated
with higher risk of cognitive impairment. However, gaps in knowledge remain about cognitive impairment in preD
and T2D: (a) What is the neuropathology other than vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia
(VCID)? (b) Is neuronal insulin dysregulation present, and is it related to peripheral insulin resistance
characteristic of preD and T2D? (c) Do the associations differ by pertinent sociodemographics, including sex,
race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and literacy? (d) Are the associations related to behavioral correlates
(sleep disturbances and depressive symptoms), also common in preD and T2D? We will characterize amnestic
and non-amnestic cognitive decline, MCI, and dementia, in all participants (n =1979). We will measure plasma
biomarkers of amyloid (Aβ42/40 ratio), tau (ptau-181), neurodegeneration (neurofilament light [NfL]), and
neuroinflammation (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) in all participants, and brain imaging markers of amyloid,
neurodegeneration (cortical thickness), cerebrovascular disease (white matter hyperintensities [WMH] and
infarcts), white matter microstructure, and functional connectivity, in a subsample of 650 participants. We will
characterize the AD continuum and non-AD pathologic change using plasma ptau-181 and Amyloid Positron
Emission Tomography (PET), following the National Institute on Aging (NIA)/Alzheimer’s Association (AA)
research framework, and will explore characterization by tau, neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and VCID.
We will isolate total circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) and neuronal origin-enriched EVs (nEVs) in all
participants once to examine systemic and neuronal insulin signaling. We will achieve our goal through the
following specific aims: (1) To examine the prevalence and incidence of amnestic and non-amnestic cognitive
decline, MCI and dementia, and examine their association with biomarkers of amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration,
neuroinflammation, and with VCID; (2) To examine the association of cognitive syndromes with systemic and
neuronal insulin signaling measured using nEVs. (3) To examine the association of sociodemographic factors
including sex, race/ethnicity, education, and literacy, with cognitive decline, MCI, and dementia, and
neuropathology biomarkers; (4) To explore the association of depressive symptoms, sleep quality, and
obstructive sleep apnea with cognitive decline, MCI, and dementia. We will also explore their association with
biomarkers of neuropathology. We will also explore (a) whether neuronal insulin signaling is related to peripheral
metabolic measures collaborating with Project 2; (b) whether findings in aims 1 and 2 vary by use of T2D
medications collaborating with Project 3; (c) the physical correlates of cognitive syndromes collaborating with
Project 4."
10924056,"The goal of Project 2 is to study the associations of type 2 diabetes (T2D) related factors with risk for cognitive
decline, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, and related neuropathologies, among persons with pre-
diabetes (PreD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS). T2D
related factors include dysglycemia, its determinants, insulin resistance (IR) and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction,
and downstream markers of pathophysiology including advanced glycation end products (AGE), as well as
peripheral vascular factors (endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, blood pressure, dyslipidemia), microvascular
(retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy) and macrovascular (non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary artery
disease) complications, ascertained longitudinally over 20 years in DPPOS. A vast body of evidence supports
T2D as a significant modifiable risk factor for cognitive impairment. However, it is not clear that T2D related
factors cause cognitive impairment in T2D. Few studies have investigated the temporal changes of T2D related
factors in people with PreD and T2D in relation to cognitive syndromes and neuropathology. As described in the
Cognitive Assessment and Adjudication Core, cognitive impairment syndromes will include amnestic and non-
amnestic cognitive decline, MCI, and dementia. As described in the Biomarker Core we will examine trajectories
of plasma biomarkers of neuropathology including amyloid (Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio), tau (ptau-181), neurofilament light
(NfL), and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) in all participants. In collaboration with Project 1, we will
additionally examine brain insulin signaling from plasma-derived neuronal extracellular vesicles as a novel
plasma biomarker of T2D related dysregulated neurophysiology. Among those participants with brain imaging,
we will use imaging biomarkers of neuropathology including brain Aβ via PET, cortical thickness, and white
matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) and infarcts on MRI to explore brain pathology. Finally, among those with
a cognitive syndrome, we will explore pathologic classification as being AD continuum or non-AD pathologic
change using the plasma biomarkers (see Neuroimaging and Plasma Biomarkers Core) and vascular
contribution to impairment or dementia (VCID) measured via adjudicated stroke by the Clinical Core. Our aims
are: (1) Examine the associations of trajectories of dysglycemia, IR, β-cell dysfunction, and AGE with risk of
cognitive syndromes, biomarkers of neuropathology, and brain insulin signaling; (2) Examine the associations of
trajectories of vascular factors and history of micro- and macrovascular complications with risk of cognitive
syndromes and biomarkers of neuropathology; (3) Build prediction models of cognitive syndromes in persons
with PreD or T2D using T2D related factors (Aims 1 and 2), sociodemographic factors (sex, race/ethnicity,
education), and genetic risk factors (APOE-e4 and diabetes genetic risk scores); Exploratory aims: Aims 1 and
2 will explore sex, race/ethnicity, and measures of cognitive reserve (e.g., education level and literacy) as
moderators of the hypothesized associations."
10845462,"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are an extraordinarily common cause of
infectious diarrhea in resource limited areas of the planet where military personnel are
frequently deployed. In endemic areas these pathogens are a major cause of morbidity
as well as mortality in young children. The acute illness associated with these
pathogens may range from mild diarrhea to severe, cholera-like disease associated with
rapid dehydration. Travelers and military personnel deployed to endemic regions are
highly susceptible to symptomatic illness caused by ETEC. Currently there is no vaccine
to prevent these infections. In addition to the acute illness these pathogens are
associated with a number of important but poorly understood sequelae including
malabsorption and tropical enteropathy, growth stunting, and cognitive impairment in
children as well as tropical malabsorption syndromes and irritable bowel syndrome in
returning travelers.
 ETEC are defined by the production of enterotoxins that lead to net export of salt
and water into the intestinal lumen. Most prior research effort has focused almost
exclusively on the cellular effects of these toxins that lead to diarrhea. However, recent
transcriptome studies of host cells following infection or treatment with toxin suggest
that these enterotoxins may impart many collateral effects relevant to our understanding
of key aspects of virulence associated with acute illness as well as the sequelae
associated with these infections. The proposed studies will focus on the interaction of
highly conserved E. coli fimbriae with a family of cell surface glycoproteins related to
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), the carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecules
(CEACAMs) that are expressed on intestinal epithelia. Interestingly our studies
demonstrate that these molecules are strongly up-regulated by ETEC heat-labile toxin
and that they may serve as a receptor for ETEC. Because these molecules play
essential roles in cellular adhesion and maintenance of tissue architecture, modulation
of their expression could play important roles in the sequelae associated with these
infections."

 Surgery often has benefits, such as reducing symptoms or extending life, but it is not without risk.
Patients vary both in their tolerance of symptoms and of surgical risk. The concept of shared, patient
preference-concordant surgical decision making potentially helps patients achieve their goals.
 Surgical decision-making for persons living with dementia (PLWD) is challenging for numerous
reasons, including limited longitudinal data on outcomes, an inability of the patient to fully participate
in the discussion, and vague advance directives with multiple caregivers(surrogates). In the absence
of evidence-based guidelines, clinicians struggle with recommendations and patients and caregivers
face uncertainty about the consequences of surgery.
 Research on dementia and surgery is limited. However, our pilot work has found that among
common vascular procedures, PLWD had poorer surgical outcomes compared with persons w/o
dementia. In other pilot work exploring the use of Advance Care Planning among PLWD facing
surgery, we are finding that surgeons do not routinely consider dementia as an independent risk
factor. A stronger evidence base has the potential to facilitate surgical decision-making.
 The proposed mixed methods study is designed to understand the epidemiology of surgery for
PLWD, as well as patient, caregiver, and provider practices and challenges of surgical decision-
making in clinical settings. We focus on surgery because it is common among elderly PLWD, it often
represents a critical inflection point in quality of life, and therefore is a fraught process for all involved.
The goal of the study is to improve decision-making and enhance recovery when surgery is chosen.
 Aim 1) Develop the evidence base to understand the case mix and comparative outcomes of
surgery provided to PLWDs. We will use large databases to describe the epidemiology of inpatient
surgery for PLWD from several perspectives intended to inform expectations and decision-making.
Case identification of dementia will take advantage of state-of-the-art methods from an ongoing R01.
 Aim 2) Characterize surgical decision-making for PLWD in practice settings, as perceived
by PLWD and their family caregivers, and providers/clinicians. Using case studies of a multi-
regional selection of 12 health systems, we will explore in-depth: 1) Approaches to surgical decision-
making for PLWDs; 2) Priorities and unmet needs of patients, families, and surgeons around surgical
decision-making; 3) Facilitators and barriers to making patient preference-concordant care decisions.
 Aim 3) Develop recommendations around surgical decision-making processes. We will
conduct a modified Delphi panel with national experts and stakeholders to develop recommendations
about surgical and non-surgical options that mitigate the unique vulnerabilities of PLWD."

 Encouraging the next generation of ophthalmology physician-scientists is a pressing need for the field. To
that end, the Indiana University School of Medicine Department of Ophthalmology proposes a T35 short-term
summer research program for medical students interested in ophthalmology research. The rationale for this
program is that early exposure to research is likely to engender ongoing interest in a research career, and that
early exposure to concepts in ophthalmology beyond the standard medical school curriculum will attract more
students to research in the specialty. Thus, the objectives of this program are to provide a research experience
that (1) introduces trainees to the diversity of research in ophthalmology, including experimental design,
methods, critical evaluation of the literature, and results presentation; (2) instills in trainees an interest in
ophthalmology through didactic lectures, workshops, and hands-on clinical training and shadowing; and (3)
offers trainees training in responsible conduct of research. To meet these objectives, the program will offer a
12-week research experience for medical students after completion of their first year. Students interested in
ophthalmology will be actively recruited from the school, as will students from underrepresented populations,
especially those entering the Indiana University School of Medicine from one of Indiana University’s multiple
pipeline programs. Program slots are requested for 6 students, who will be paired with mentors selected from a
pool of 17 participating faculty. Faculty research interests span basic, translational, and clinical research in
major areas of ophthalmology, with particular strengths in retina, glaucoma, and pediatric ophthalmology.
Trainees will spend the majority of their time working on mentored research projects with their mentors, but will
also engage in other enrichment activities, including responsible conduct of research lectures and workshops.
Innovative aspects of the enrichment activities include (1) integration with the Indiana University Medical
Student Program for Research and Scholarship (IMPRS), a School-wide summer research program, exposing
trainees to scientific and research career-oriented seminars from diverse faculty; (2) a one-day “boot camp”
teaching trainees key basic concepts in vision science and clinical ophthalmology; and (3) interprofessional
education opportunities provided by videoconference participation in a class on “Critical Evaluation of Vision
Science Literature” offered by the Indiana University School of Optometry to their summer OD student
researchers. The Department and School have a deep commitment to this new T35 program, which will
leverage the highly successful infrastructure of IMPRS while providing unique, and currently lacking,
ophthalmology-specific content and trainee slots. The long-term goal of the program is to increase the pool of
ophthalmology physician-scientists in Indiana and nationally by generating excitement about vision science
research through an integrated, dynamic summer research opportunity in the field."
10845477,"Project Summary/Abstract
Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss affecting 60 million people world-wide. Despite this,
prevention and treatment of glaucoma are limited. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common form,
is characterized by progressive retinal ganglion cell death leading to optic neuropathy, often caused by elevated
intraocular pressure (IOP). The long-term goals of the proposed research are to identify genomic regions that
affect gene expression in glaucoma-relevant eye tissues, and in combination with large-scale human genetic
association studies, to uncover novel causal genes and key biological processes that can lead to glaucoma, which
may serve as effective drug targets for novel therapies. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to the
discovery of over 20 genomic loci associated with POAG and over 100 loci associated with IOP, however extracting
biological insights from these genetic associations has been challenging, largely due to the fact that the associated
variants lie in noncoding regions. Furthermore, much of the heritability of glaucoma has yet to be detected. The
Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project has shown that genetic variants associated with gene expression
variation (eQTLs) substantially contribute to disease risk, however GTEx does not contain data for ocular tissues.
The working hypothesis of the proposed research, supported by our preliminary results, is that hundreds of
regulatory effects will contribute to the pathogenicity of glaucoma and will explain much of its heritability, and
that the affected genes will cluster in disease-relevant biological processes. We thus propose in Aim 1, to create
a high-quality map of the transcriptome and open chromatin regions (indicative of transcriptional activity), and to
identify genetic variants associated with gene expression (eQTLs) and alternative splicing (sQTLs) in four key
pathogenic tissues for glaucoma: outflow pathway (trabecular meshwork and Schlemm’s canal), ciliary body,
optic nerve, and macular retina, collected from 100 postmortem donors. We will use RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and
whole genome sequencing on bulk tissue and we will further identify cell type-specific eQTLs and sQTLs using
cell type-specific gene expression profiles from single cell RNA-seq studies that are available to us. In Aim 2, we
will apply novel computational and statistical methods that integrate data from Aim 1 with GWAS data of high or
normal-tension glaucoma and several risk factor traits, with the goal of identifying new genetic associations, and
the underlying causal genes, pathways, and pathogenic cell types for glaucoma. To broaden the impact of our
work, we will build a web-based platform for sharing, browsing, and inspecting gene expression and genetic
regulation data from the different eye tissues in relation to genetic associations with glaucoma and other complex
eye traits (Aim 3). The proposed research is expected to significantly improve our understanding of the
pathophysiology of glaucoma, uncover novel genetic risk factors, and open new avenues for therapeutic
development. Our genomics eye resource will also be valuable for studying the molecular causes of other eye
diseases, such as retinal degeneration diseases, and for tissue-targeted gene therapy design."
10845527,"Project Summary/Abstract
By 2060, approximately 14 million adults are expected to live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia
(ADRD). Although ADRD patients represent 10% of the general geriatric population, they account for 37% of
the direct healthcare expenditures. Compared to other older adults, ADRD patients are at a significantly higher
risk of hospitalization and unplanned 30-day hospital readmission (hereafter “readmission”). Readmissions are
costly and expose ADRD patients to expedited cognitive decline, premature institutionalization, and death.
Availability of a caregiver after hospital discharge is critical for ADRD patients to ensure adherence to diet,
medications, and follow-up appointments. There is a paucity of evidence examining readmission among the
ADRD population. Most risk-assessment tools (e.g. LACE Index) have poor discrimination power and lack
inclusion of influential medical and social features, and caregiver availability particular to ADRD patients. A
potential solution is to develop a risk tool using hospitals’ electronic health records (EHRs) because they
contain salient clinical and sociodemographic features as well as a wealth of information from physicians’,
nurses’ and social workers’ notes (unstructured EHRs data). The specific research aims for this proposal
are to (1) develop and validate a risk-assessment tool for predicting readmission among ADRD
patients; (2) examine the feasibility/acceptability and clinical/economic utility of the readmission risk-
assessment tool; and (3) develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to extract information
on caregiver availability from unstructured EHRs (exploratory). We hypothesize that the predictive power
of our risk tool will be at least 20% higher than that of LACE Index (the current risk tool used in the Michigan
Medicine hospitals). To accomplish this project, my mentors and I have defined a set of targeted career goals
and educational training. My training aims include (1) gain familiarity with the clinical aspects of ADRD
(linked with Research Aim 1); (2) acquire methodological skills in machine learning and predictive
modeling (linked with Research Aim 1); (3) develop an understanding of the logistics of the ADRD
patient discharge and care transition processes (linked with Research Aim 2); and (4) gain proficiency
in NLP and algorithm validation (linked with Research Aim 3). By completion of this award, I will have used
EHRs and data science to develop a validated risk-assessment tool for readmission for hospitalized ADRD
patients. The results will enable efficient and targeted discharge planning to reduce readmission and wasteful
spending. It will also provide pilot data needed to apply for an R01 examining the optimization of discharge
process/location for hospitalized ADRD patients. This career development award will lay the foundation for me
to become a unique health economist specialized in efficient care transitions for ADRD patients."

Discovering preclinical markers of cognitive and functional decline in mild cognitive impairment and dementia
is fundamental for treatment development and to delay disease onset and progression. Subtle functional
deficits on cognitively demanding activities often foreshadow dementia onset, but these early deficits are
difficult to assess objectively with conventional methods. The proposed studies aspire to develop and validate
performance-based indices for measuring functional deficits at older ages that are cost-effective, unobtrusive,
and that could serve as early markers of subsequent cognitive decline and dementia. Specifically, we propose to
develop indices of functional deficits that can be derived from participant response behaviors in existing
population representative surveys. Completing a survey is a complex and cognitively demanding task that taxes
a respondent's neuropsychological capacity. By focusing on how individuals complete surveys, we aim to derive
a series of indices of functional deficits using two approaches: (1) The first approach consists of indices that are
directly computed from participants' response patterns in questionnaires to capture invalid, incoherent, or
erroneous responding on rating scales (examples include agreeing or disagreeing with statements regardless of
content, skipping questions, or giving contradictory responses). (2) The second approach considers indices
derived from individuals' computer use behavior in online surveys to measure the efficiency, speed, and
consistency of behaviors during the completion of online surveys (examples include the proportion of
corrected/changed answers, average response time, and response time variability). To evaluate the validity and
clinical utility of the indices, we will systematically examine their associations with conceptually related
constructs (concurrent cognitive test scores, instrumental activities of daily living, financial wellbeing, frailty),
their sensitivity to change with age, their ability to predict subsequent cognitive decline, and their ability to
predict the subsequent onset of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Self-report surveys administered
regularly in 16 existing longitudinal panel studies (>50,000 participants) will provide a rich basis for
developing and testing indices derived from response patterns in questionnaires. An ongoing population
representative Internet panel will provide the opportunity to test computer use behavior indices that are
unobtrusively recorded “in the background” of online surveys. Marshalling multiple datasets and aggregating
results across diverse samples and survey measures using identical data-analytic models will greatly enhance
generalizability and test the breadth of applicability of each index. Examining the predictive accuracy of the
indices alone and in concert will allow us to identify those indices that contribute substantial prognostic
information and those that provide irrelevant or redundant information. This research has potential to broaden
the repertoire of available tools that could signal cognitive and functional decline in older ages and allow for
advanced study of dementia."

and prevention of disease. The Knight ADRC's efforts thus fully align with the primary goal of the National
Alzheimer's Project Act of 2011, “to prevent and effectively treat ADRD by 2025”. We provide well-
characterized research participants (persons with symptomatic AD and age-matched controls), their clinical,
psychometric, and imaging data, and their tissue (DNA, CSF, plasma, dermal fibroblasts, iPSCs, brain tissue)
to research projects. We also provide intellectual and financial support to scientists at Washington University,
at other Alzheimer Disease Centers, and the research community nationally and internationally and engage in
formal and informal collaborations, including multi-disciplinary/multi-Center studies and the initiatives
sponsored by the National Institute on Aging, the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center, and the National
Centralize Repository for ADRD. Historically, our Center has focused on the earliest stages of dementia to
identify the initial clinical and pathologic changes that distinguish AD from normal aging. Our approach is
balanced between clinical and basic science domains with emphasis on interdisciplinary efforts. We will
continue our training of students, fellows and junior faculty in clinical and basic science research skills. We will
continue to engage in outreach activities to transfer information on ADRD to lay and professional audiences.
We are committed to assuring that our research cohort reflects the racial diversity of the greater metropolitan
St. Louis area and will continue activities that promote the inclusion of these populations in research.

10827232,"The varied and complex symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) present significant challenges for
the development of effective treatments. To provide targeted interventions, an understanding of neurobiological
etiology is imperative. Studies have uncovered strong single gene risk factors for NDDs, prominent among
which are genes coding for chromatin remodelers. The chromatin remodeler CHD8 has emerged among such
genes with one of the highest frequency of de novo mutations in ASD cohorts. Intriguingly, CHD8 mutations
have also been discovered in other neurological disorder cohorts, including schizophrenia and obsessive
compulsive disorder (OCD). Thus, CHD8 represents a model for rare monogenic NDDs, with a common core
set of symptoms associated with ASD, but overall broad and complex expressivity spanning early development
through adulthood. Various Chd8 mouse models have been generated, with constitutive mutants exhibiting
NDD-relevant phenotypes. However, in these models the wide expression of Chd8 and its involvement in early
development have hampered dissociation of developmental effects from effects on mature neurons. Moreover,
experimental emphasis on the cerebral cortex and hippocampus has limited advancement from genetic
findings to causal neurobiology. The cerebellum (CB) has been consistently and causally associated with
NDDs, including in emerging studies of developmental roles of Chd8, and has been implicated in
schizophrenia and OCD. Even though roles of the CB have expanded from a motor control center to include
cognitive and affective (i.e., limbic) functionality, CB non-motor contributions and pathology remain
understudied in neuropsychiatric and NDD research compared to forebrain regions. Further, CB studies in
NDDs have primarily investigated developmental impacts. However, Chd8 expression persists in the adult CB.
This raises the novel hypothesis that conditional Chd8 deletion in the adult CB contributes to neuropsychiatric
and NDD-relevant pathology. Here we propose initial work toward testing this model, defining the impact
of conditional Chd8 ablation on adult CB function across behavioral, genomic and electrophysiological
dimensions. In two aims, we will manipulate Chd8 expression in CB output nuclei and test CB-specific
vulnerabilities in limbic behaviors; investigate CB transcriptomic phenotypes; and begin to probe pathology in
the functional connectivity of CB output circuits to the limbic system. These experiments will establish impacts
of conditional Chd8 ablation on the developed CB and output circuits; pinpoint molecular underpinnings of CB
dysfunction; and begin to build a circuit-level understanding of how Chd8 ablation impacts CB connectivity with
the rest of the brain. If successful, this work will lead to new avenues of research on CB dysfunction in NDDs
by linking a high confidence risk gene with behavioral, cellular, molecular, and circuit deficits in the CB. By
pinpointing biological processes and circuits that remain vulnerable to Chd8 ablation in the developed CB, this
line of research has the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets over a time-extended treatment window."

10836894,"Subcellular compartmentalization is a fundamental characteristic of life that helps cells to regulate their
metabolism in time and space, carry out specialized metabolic reactions, prevent toxicity, and store nutrients. As
prokaryotes generally do not possess membrane organelles, they have to rely on protein-based approaches to
compartmentalize their cytoplasm. Protein organelles are nano-sized functional analogues of eukaryotic
membrane organelles and utilize a semipermeable protein shell to create a sequestered space separated from
the rest of the cell. This compartmentalization strategy can increase the local concentrations of enzymes and
metabolites, prevent the leakage of toxic or volatile intermediates, and create unique microenvironments with
regard to pH and redox state. Protein organelles enable specialized biochemistry that would not be possible
without compartmentalization. Protein organelles are present in nearly all bacterial and archaeal phyla and can
be found in many important human commensals and pathogens. Protein organelles have been suggested to
increase bacterial stress resistance, allow the utilization of alternative nutrients, and help bacteria to colonize the
human host. The two main classes of microbial protein organelles are encapsulin nanocompartments (20-50 nm)
and bacterial microcompartments (40-200 nm). In both cases, specialized enzymatic machinery is selectively
encapsulated within self-assembling protein shells leading to unique catalytic capabilities. The overall goal of my
laboratory is to explore and understand the functional diversity of protein organelles encoded in microbial
genomes. Thousands of commensal and pathogenic bacteria encode encapsulins or BMCs which have been
proposed to increase bacterial fitness and adaptability in dynamic environments. However, the structures,
molecular mechanisms, and physiological functions of most protein organelles have not been explored while
their contributions towards human health and disease are poorly understood. To change this, we will prioritize
four research areas, focusing on protein organelle (1) structure and enzymology, (2) contribution towards stress
resistance, (3) role in nutrient utilization and metabolism, and (4) involvement in secondary metabolite
biosynthesis. We will use a multifaceted strategy relying on biochemistry, structural biology, and microbiology
approaches. Our findings will provide novel biochemical, structural, and physiological insights into the role of
protein-based compartmentalization in bacteria and help elucidate how protein organelles contribute towards the
fitness of both commensal and pathogenic bacteria. This information will be essential for exploring future

The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has recently made remarkable advances that resulted in new and
improved algorithms and network architectures that proved efficient empirically in silico. These
advances raise new questions in neurobiology: are these new algorithms used in the brain? The
present study focuses on a new algorithm developed in the field of reinforcement learning (RL), called
distributional RL, which outperforms other state-of-the-art RL algorithms and is regarded as a major
advancement in RL. In environments in which rewards are probabilistic with respect to its occurrence
and size, traditional RL algorithms have focused on learning to predict a single quantity, the average
over all potential rewards. Distributional RL, by contrast, learns to predict the entire distribution over
rewards (or values) by employing multiple value predictors that together encode all possible levels of
future reward concurrently. Remarkably, theoretical work has shown that a class of distributional RL,
called ‘quantile distributional RL’, can arise out of a simple modification of traditional RL that
introduces structured variability in dopamine reward prediction error (RPE) signals.
This project set out to test the hypothesis that the brain utilizes distributional RL to predict future
rewards. Aim 1 will explore the characteristics of distributional RL theoretically and make predictions
that allow for testing distributional RL in the brain. Theoretical investigations and simulations will be
used to determine how value representations in distributional RL differ from pre-existing population
coding schemes for representing probability distributions (probabilistic population codes, distributed
distributional codes, etc.). Aim 2 will examine the activity of neurons that are thought to signal RPEs
and reward expectation and test various predictions of distributional RL. Specifically, the activity of
dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area and neurons in the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal
cortex will be compared to key predictions of distributional RL. Aim 3 will use optogenetic
manipulation to causally demonstrate the relationship between RPE signals and distributional codes."

Kir4.1/Kir5.1 in distal convoluted tubule (DCT) plays a key role in mediating the effect of low K+ (LK) or high K+
(HK) and low sodium (LS) or high sodium (HS) intake on NCC through Cl--sensitive with-no-lysine kinase
(WNK) which regulates ste20-proline-alanine rich kinase (SPAK), a key kinase for controlling NCC activity.
Although many details of this signaling mechanism explaining the effects of chronic dietary K+ or Na+ intake
have been elucidated, we have demonstrated that chronic perturbations remodel the distal nephron. Thus, the
observed changes may not reflect the initial dynamic response of Kir4.1/Kir5.1 and NCC in the DCT.
Importantly, dietary intake is typically episodic, leading to highly dynamic electrolyte excretory patterns. The
DCT comprises an early part (DCT1) and a late part (DCT2). While basolateral Kir4.1/Kir5.1 and apical NCC
are expressed along both DCT1 and DCT2, the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and ROMK are only
detected in the DCT2. This raises the possibility that the response of Kir4.1/Kir5.1 and NCC to short-term
dietary K+ or Na+ may differ between DCT1 and DCT2, contributing to rapid homeostatic effects. We now
hypothesize that dietary K+-intake induced regulation of Kir4.1/Kir5.1, WNK and NCC is initiated
predominantly in the DCT1, whereas dietary Na+-induced or AngII-application-induced regulation of
Kir4.1/Kir5.1, WNK, NCC is started mainly in the DCT2 via type 1a angiotensin II receptor (AT1aR). This
hypothesis is supported by several lines of preliminary data:1) Overnight LK intake stimulates Kir4.1/Kir5
activity in the DCT1 but not in the DCT2; 2) Overnight LS intake increases Kir4.1/Kir5.1 currents predominantly
in the DCT2 but to a lesser degree in the DCT1; 3) Deletion of AT1aR in the kidney abolishes the overnight-
LS-induced stimulation of Kir4.1/Kir5.1 of the DCT and NCC; 4) Acute application of AngII stimulates
Kir4.1/Kir5.1 only in DCT2 and enhances NCC function; 5) Overnight AngII infusion robustly stimulates
Kir4.1/Kir5.1 activity in DCT2 but to a less degree in the DCT1; 6) Overnight AngII infusion stimulates WNK4
and NCC expression/activity in Kcnj10-/- mice but not in Kir4.1 knockout mice. The three specific aims of the
proposal are: 1) Test whether dietary K+ and Na+ induced regulation of Kir4.1/Kir5.1, WNK and NCC is different
between DCT1 and DCT2; 2) Test whether acute or overnight AngII treatment activates Kir4.1/Kir5.1 and NCC
predominately in the DCT2 but not in the DCT1 and that the activation of Kir4.1/Kir5.1 is essential for acute but
not chronic AngII-induced stimulation of WNK4 and NCC 3) Test whether deletion of AT1aR impairs the
stimulatory effect of overnight LS but not overnight LK on Kir4.1/Kir5.1, WNK4 , pNCC and K+ homeostasis.
The physiological significance of the proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying dual regulation of the
DCT, such that DCT1 behaves like a “K+-sensor” and DCT2 behaves like a “Na+-sensor”. This differential
response is essential for normal physiological homeostasis during short-term alterations in K+ or Na+ intake."

Prevalent, morbid, and costly (≥$83 billion/year), urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) is a major problem,
especially for older women. With etiology usually ascribed to bladder spasms, the available therapies are
bladder-targeted and provide only a modest benefit. Despite inadequate response and poor adherence, there
has been little change in therapeutic approach to UUI in decades, and a novel holistic approach to complement
or enhance current treatment will have a significant impact on care of those with the debilitating symptoms.
UUI has strong bidirectional relationship with poor sleep, a prevalent complaint in older adults. Up to 50% of
older adults report poor sleep, which increases the risk of UUI by up to 55% over 5 years. The brain plays a
vital role in the continence mechanism and sleep is known to affect the pathways involved in executive
continence control. Specifically, sleep loss is associated with hypoactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC) – a region we have identified to be involved in executive control of voiding, and potential therapeutic
response to biofeedback-assisted pelvic floor muscle therapy. Hence, we hypothesize that poor sleep inhibits
bladder control as it does with cognitive tasks; and addressing sleep will improve executive control of the
bladder complementing concurrent bladder-targeted UUI therapy.
Our overall goals are to: (a) assess the additional benefit of behavioral sleep intervention on UUI to the
standard of care (β3- adrenoceptor agonist mirabegron) providing evidence for assessing and addressing
sleep for treatment of UUI, and (b) better understand the brain’s role in the effect of sleep on UU providing
rationale to investigate other ameliorative brain-based therapies targeting the identified brain pathways.
Specific aims are to examine the effect of adjunctive Brief Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia (BBTI) with the
first-line pharmacotherapy: mirabegron on (1) UUI; (2) nocturia; (3) mPFC activity to confirm therapeutic
mechanisms by assessing the effect of sleep on currently understood mediators; and (4) durability of
therapeutic response.
We will randomize 100 women aged ≥ 60 years to receive 8 weeks of either mirabegron alone or
mirabegron+BBTI, assessing bladder symptoms, sleep, and functional and structural brain changes pre- and
post-intervention. We will also explore the durability of therapeutic response at 6-months post-intervention.
The study will provide the first-ever data on a comprehensive multicomponent brain-bladder therapy for
incontinence targeting the known brain mechanisms involve in continence control. It will evaluate clinical
response and durability of this novel pairing and provide an understanding of the underlying pathways involved
in its therapeutic mechanism."

The goal of this proposal is to install an integrated radiosynthesis system for the production of non-commercially
available PET radiotracers for preclinical imaging applications at the UC Davis Center for Molecular and Genomic
Imaging (CMGI). We propose to incorporate a commercial radiosynthesis unit dedicated to the production of
PET radiotracers complete with shielding enclosures allowing the safe and efficient production of the
radiotracers. The integrated system will allow for the automated production of PET radiotracers radiolabeled with
the positron emitter fluorine-18. It includes all necessary components to support radiotracer production and will
allow us to synthesize both established and novel PET radiotracers. As the NIH roadmap calls for an emphasis
on translational research and has identified molecular imaging as a priority, UC Davis is proposing to strengthen
functional and molecular imaging in animal models for future translation to humans by utilizing the system. The
system will be installed at the CMGI, which is a campus-designated and supported core facility providing
infrastructure and expertise to conduct in vivo imaging studies in animal models, from rodents to non-human
primates and companion animals. CMGI is the only location on our campus that oversees a cyclotron and
radiochemistry facilities dedicated to preclinical imaging research. Institutional support provided to the CMGI
ensures the successful operation and maintenance of the system for its lifetime. The system will support at least
10 major and minor users who are conducting NIH-funded research in diverse areas such as gene therapy,

Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains among the leading causes of deaths in the U.S. While a sedentary
lifestyle, unhealthful diets, smoking behaviors, and genetic predispositions are established risk factors of CHD,
emerging evidence suggests that environmental pollutants, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
(PFAS), may also contribute to the CHD etiology. Potential connections between PFAS exposures and
dyslipidemia have been extensively examined in epidemiological studies, although significant heterogeneity
among studies was observed. More recent evidence suggests that PFAS may particularly interfere with the
metabolism of pro-atherogenic lipoprotein subspecies that carry apolipoprotein CIII and other apolipoproteins,
which are significantly associated with CHD risk in multiple prospective studies. This new evidence points to a
new pathway through which PFAS may influence CHD risk. Data are still sparse regarding the inter-
relationships among PFAS, lipoprotein subspecies, and incident CHD risk in the U.S. population who are
ubiquitously exposed to PFAS. The proposed research aims to address these important knowledge gaps by
conducting cross-sectional and longitudinal investigations to substantiate the associations of PFAS with
lipoprotein subspecies and CHD risk in four well-characterized U.S. cohort studies consisting of ethnically-
diverse participants: the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), NHSII, and
Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos (SOL). The rich, existing resources and data allow the
investigators to cost-effectively examine these study aims: 1) to examine various PFAS in relation to lipoprotein
subspecies in blood samples repeatedly collected during the past three decades; 2) to evaluate longitudinally
the changes of PFAS in relation to the contemporaneous changes of lipoprotein subspecies in repeat blood
samples collected ~10 years apart in the NHS/NHSII and SOL cohorts; and 3) to investigate prospective
associations between PFAS and CHD risk and to explore the role of the lipoprotein subspecies in these
associations of interest. Besides filling the knowledge gaps, the innovation of the proposed research also lies
in the coverage of some newly emerged PFAS that can only be meaningfully measured in blood samples
collected recently, the examination of longitudinal relationships between PFAS and lipoprotein subspecies, and
the inclusion of Hispanic participants from the SOL cohort. A highly experienced investigator team consisting of
environmental and cardiovascular disease epidemiologists, lipoprotein and PFAS research experts, and
biostatisticians has been assembled to achieve the study goals in a timely fashion with great qualities. Data
from this proposed research will shed light on the role of PFAS exposures in modulating lipoprotein subspecies
and CHD risk in U.S. populations. Such evidence may also aid in policy-making processes for making more
evidence-based regulations toward the production and use of PFAS in the U.S."
10861405,"PROJECT SUMMARY – OVERALL: MACHINE LEARNING-ENABLED DESIGN OF PROTOTYPE
 PATHOGEN VACCINES AND ANTIBODIES
We propose a highly synergistic Center focused on developing end-to-end strategies for pandemic
preparedness vaccine development for bunyaviruses and paramyxoviruses. Our Center brings together five
research institutions with complementary and synergistic expertise in computational protein design,
structure-based vaccine design, mRNA vaccines, structural biology, viral entry, viral diversity and evolution,
animal model development, high biosafety-level containment virology, vaccinology, and vaccine process
development and technology transfer. Our team has real-world experience in vaccine and biologics product
development in both academic and industry settings. Our Center comprises five Scientific Projects supported
by three Scientific Cores, an Administrative Core, and a Data Management Core. Our Scientific Projects
include: 1) Development of computational methods for vaccine and biologics design, 2) Fundamental research
on viral entry and receptors, 3) Antigen design, 4) Protein nanoparticle vaccine development, and 5) mRNA
vaccine development. We will structure our efforts in two phases: in Phase 1 (Years 1-3) we will focus on
developing vaccines for our prototype pathogens and in Phase 2 (Years 4-5) we will apply those learnings to
two new bunyaviruses and two new paramyxoviruses to demonstrate that our computational and experimental
approaches generalize across viral families. Our prototype pathogens are: Lassa virus (LASV; arenaviruses),
Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; phenuiviruses), and Hendra virus (HeV; paramyxoviruses). We carefully selected
our prototypes as we believe they present specific vaccine design challenges which, if we are successful in
solving, will facilitate the development of vaccines against related viruses. Simultaneously, the antigens from
viruses in these three families have some similarities that will give rise to synergies in our design approaches.
The structure of our Center will allow maximal synergy between our groups in pursuit of its central output: to
define generalizable approaches and tools to develop vaccines and biologics for emerging pathogens with
pandemic potential."
10861410,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CORE E: PHYLOGENETIC AND MUTATIONAL SCANNING
This Core will use cutting-edge experimental and computational techniques to ensure that the vaccines target
the full relevant evolutionary breadth of the prototype virus families, and to map the breadth and specificity of
vaccine-elicited antibody responses. To do this, the Core will combine sequencing and phylogenetic analyses
with deep mutational scanning to characterize viral diversity and its impact on the vaccines. First, existing
sequence data on each of the prototype viruses will be integrated into the nextstrain platform to facilitate easy
surveillance and phylogenetic analyses. These data will then be used to inform the creation of phylogenetic
and deep mutational scanning libraries to experimentally characterize the natural and possible future
mutational diversity of the key viral glycoproteins. The libraries will utilize a powerful new pseudotyped lentiviral
deep mutational scanning system that enables variants of any viral entry glycoprotein to be characterized at
high-throughput using safe non-replicative virions at biosafety level 2. For each prototype viral entry
glycoprotein, the Core will create two types of libraries: phylogenetic libraries that contain variants spanning the
natural diversity of that virus, and deep mutational scanning libraries that contain all amino-acid mutants of key
representatives of each virus. These pseudotyped lentiviral libraries will be used to characterize how all natural
and mutational variants of the viral glycoproteins mediate entry in cell culture, and are recognized by
monoclonal and polyclonal serum antibodies. Initially, the resulting information will inform the design and
testing of the immunogens in the Center Projects. Then as these immunogens proceed into testing, the
libraries will be used to map the specificity and breadth of the elicited neutralizing responses. Taken together,
this Core will therefore provide a resource that can inform the Center Projects through all steps from initial
immunogen design to characterization of vaccine-elicited responses."
10861411,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 1: COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
Project 1 will develop the general computational methods that underpin our Center’s approaches to vaccine
and antibody design. In Aim 1, the Baker and DiMaio labs will extend the RoseTTAFold2 network to enable
truly general biomolecular structure prediction, including full-atom models of protein post-translational
modifications, large symmetric or asymmetric protein complexes, and antibody-antigen complexes. These
methods will be critical for predicting the structures of viral glycoprotein antigens from our Center’s target viral
families as well as their receptors, both of which form symmetric and sometimes asymmetric complexes and
feature post-translational modifications such as N-linked glycosylation. This new All-Atom RoseTTAFold will
also be used as an oracle to evaluate how strongly the sequences of our Center’s designed antigens and
nanoparticle vaccines encode their target structures, allowing us to select the best designs for experimental
characterization. Finally, developing the ability to accurately predict the structures of antibody-antigen
complexes from sequence alone, a long-standing goal in structural biology and immunology, will be a powerful
tool for analyzing vaccine-elicited antibodies and will lay the foundation for de novo antibody design. In Aim 2,
the Baker lab will extend their machine learning methods for protein design, RF Diffusion and ProteinMPNN.
These methods provide two fundamental capabilities—de novo backbone generation and amino acid
sequence design—that will enable our Center to design antibodies and vaccines with unprecedented scale and
precision. In Aim 3, the DiMaio lab will combine existing machine-learning methods with newly developed
methods to extend the capabilities of cryo-electron microscopy. Specifically, these methods will enable
accurate structure determination from samples of proteins with various conformational states as well as
moderate-resolution datasets of antigens in complex with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. In our Center,
structures determined using these methods will guide the design of antigens stabilized in target conformations
that elicit potent neutralizing antibody responses, as well as monoclonal antibodies with exceptional
neutralizing potency and protective breadth. The computational methods developed in Project 1 will provide
our Center with unique tools that power our highly innovative approaches to antibody, antigen, and
nanoparticle vaccine design. All of the computational methods will be provided to the ReVAMPP network and
the broader scientific community as free, open-source software to speed biological research."

and characterization efforts will leverage the expansive facilities, high-tech equipment, and unique expertise in

designed antigens and nanoparticle vaccines produced to support Projects 3-5 of our Center, the Core will
produce and provide to the ReVAMPP network high-quality protein reagents such as monoclonal antibodies,
viral entry receptors, and benchmark antigens to accelerate vaccine design and evaluation broadly. mRNA
vaccine production and characterization will take place in a newly formed mRNA Core Laboratory at the IPD
built on cutting-edge equipment and production processes from Quantoom Biosciences, as well as lipid
nanoparticle formulation through an ongoing collaboration with Acuitas Therapeutics. Core C will also perform
detailed and comprehensive process development on our lead vaccine candidates, building on the IPD’s
proven track record in translating innovative protein-based medicines and vaccines to industry and government
partners. A dedicated team at the IPD will develop the methods, data, and documentation for comprehensive

designed protein medicines to industry or government partners for cGMP manufacturing and clinical
development, including three nanoparticle vaccines that have all entered clinical trials, one of which, our RBD
nanoparticle vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, has been licensed for use in multiple countries. The unique expertise,

Some non-combustible tobacco products, such as various forms of smokeless tobacco (ST), can pose
significantly fewer risks to individual users than traditional cigarettes, including those for several types of
cancers. Although not safe, these products might offer the potential for harm reduction for adults who smoke
cigarettes who completely switch to them. Recognizing these issues, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
developed a new pathway by which tobacco companies can apply for modified-risk tobacco product (MRTP)
status and to legally make modified risk claims about their products. In March 2023, the FDA announced that
Copenhagen, the top-selling ST brand in the US, could legally make a modified risk claim in its advertising that
complete switching from cigarettes to the product reduces risk of lung cancer. FDA had previously authorized a
comparable claim for another ST brand, General Snus, about reduced risks for multiple diseases. The FDA’s
authorization of these ST claims is notable given that previous implicit health claims and tactics used by the
tobacco industry in marketing cigarettes (notably “light” cigarettes”) are now banned by the FDA. Given the
relative recency of these ST claim authorizations, little is still known about how such claims may impact
consumer behavior and health. Effects may depend on several factors including whether participants are
exposed to the claims and find them to be believable and persuasive. Another open and innovative question is
whether newly authorized claims for smokeless tobacco products, which make explicit health references, may
improve expectancies about and subjective ratings for these smokeless products when using them. Indeed,
previous studies show that tobacco marketing, such as packaging color and marketing descriptors (e.g.,
“smooth), can impact subjective ratings of those products when used. This is important given that negative
product perceptions related to subjective use characteristics (such as taste, satisfaction, liking) have been
noted as barriers/reasons why smokers have not switched to these products in the past. A negative sensory
experience may undermine confidence in reduced risk claims and lead to reduced use intentions, whereas
enjoyable sensory experiences may lead to a reevaluation of beliefs about harmfulness, which in turn may
increase future intentions to use. Overall, the current study seeks to explore consumer responses to the
announcement and implementation of these new modified risk claims using a series of complementary and
innovative research activities, including an online survey and experiment, an experimental auction, and an in-
person product use lab study. Two specific aims will explore 1) consumers’ exposure and reactions to
authorized smokeless tobacco MRTP claims; and 2) whether the MRTP claims influence smokeless tobacco
demand and sensory evaluations."

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common type of head and neck cancer. Most patients with
OSCC are diagnosed at advanced stages and have significant mortality and recurrence rates. In addition to PD-
1-based immunotherapy, cetuximab (CTX) is the only FDA-approved anti-epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) monoclonal antibody to treat this disease. However, only a small proportion of OSCC patients benefit
from CTX monotherapy or CTX-based combination therapies, and most of them eventually develop resistance.
These clinical challenges underscore the need to develop safer and more effective treatment strategies to
improve the efficacy of CTX therapy in OSCC. Through an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout
screening, we have identified TNF-mediated pro-survival pathway as the dominant driver of reduced CTX
efficacy in OSCC cells. Strikingly, IACS-010759 (IACS), an orally bioavailable mitochondrial complex I inhibitor,
redirects TNF signaling from cell survival to gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis in CTX-treated OSCC
cells via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanism. Our pilot studies in a human EGFR (hEGFR)-
expressing murine oral cancer model further demonstrated that CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity is
essential for CTX/IACS-induced remission of GSDMD+ oral tumors. Based on these novel and significant findings,
we formulated our central hypothesis that the therapeutic efficacy of CTX/IACS combination is not only due to
its ability to suppress tumor growth, but also critically depends on the interplay between therapy-induced
pyroptotic tumor cells and the host immune system, leading to a durable and more effective elimination of OSCC.
This mechanism-driven project will integrate unbiased molecular and immunological technologies and multiple
preclinical models to advance our understanding of the molecular and immunological mechanisms, and to
develop an improved CTX/IACS combination therapy to facilitate clinical translation. To achieve these goals, we
will elucidate the mechanisms by which IACS is synergistic with CTX against OSCC by inducing NLRP3
inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis (Aim 1) and define the immunomodulatory mechanisms and effects
associated with OSCC cell pyroptosis induced by the combination of CTX/IACS (Aim 2). We will also evaluate
an improved CTX/IACS combination therapy designed with tumor-targeting nanotechnology to maximize efficacy
while minimizing toxicity to facilitate clinical translation (Aim 3). Results of this project should provide us with
preclinical data for the translational development of a Phase 1 clinical trial using this novel combination strategy
to preferentially target EGFR-overexpressing OSCC."

Obesity is a severely debilitating disease state that afflicts 650 million people worldwide. The increased
prevalence of obesity is associated with a number of other diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
and hypertension. Given its implications for health care, it is now considered a global epidemic by the World
Health Organization. These alarming statistics call for a need to understand neurobiological mechanisms that
underlie the development of obesity. The goal of the current proposal is to understand the role that methyl-
CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) plays in the etiology of obesity. Recent studies implicate a role of this
neuroepigenetic regulator in precipitating obesity in mouse models and in children diagnosed with Prader-Willi
Syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by hyperphagia and marked obesity. The current
proposal will utilize transgenic mouse models in which Mecp2 is knocked out in order to understand the
neurobiological consequences of Cre-lox mediated knock out of this epigenetic factor in hypothalamic pro-
opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. Another goal of this proposal is to understand how POMC-specific
knockout of Mecp2 can alter behavioral responses to food. The data from this proposal will elucidate the role
that MeCP2 plays on the development of obesity and may ultimately lead to therapeutic strategies with which

Treatment Response
PTOA is a common, incapacitating, chronic condition among individuals who sustain traumatic joint injuries.
Currently, even after “successful” surgical reconstruction of the trauma-induced pathoanatomy, supplemented
with chondroregenerative interventions, cartilage degeneration continues to progress. Therapies to improve
PTOA clinical outcomes are being developed, including chondroprotective disease modifying drugs that mitigate
or reverse degeneration of cartilage lesions and chondroregenerative tissue engineering platforms that better
recapitulate the composition and structure of healthy hyaline cartilage. However, the ability to assess the efficacy
of PTOA treatments that preserve and/or regenerate cartilage is burdened by a lack of standardized diagnostic
biomarkers that can objectively evaluate the efficacy of PTOA treatments. For clinical diagnostics, arthroscopic-
based macroscopic cartilage grading systems (Outerbridge, ICRS) and MRI portrayals of cartilage composition
are, at best, only moderately correlated with quantitative assessments of cartilage composition and material
properties relevant to the mechanical integrity and functional performance of the regenerate tissue. Raman
spectroscopy is an inelastic light scattering technique that reflects individual molecular vibrational bonds,
corresponding to specific biochemical building blocks of key cartilage constituents: GAG, collagen, and water.
We propose developing a comprehensive Raman platform for monitoring cartilage compositional biomarkers
over the hierarchy of model systems employed for cartilage treatment research, including: 1) a clinical Raman-
based arthroscopic probe that achieves real-time analysis of cartilage in in vivo animal studies and patient clinical
trials, and 2) a tissue-culture compatible Raman-spectroscopy-interfaced plate reader for the rapid, non-
destructive, repeated-measure analysis of live cartilage explants ex vivo. We hypothesize that derived Raman
biomarkers can predict the composition, morphology, and material properties of cartilage in response to
chondroprotective and/or chondroregenerative treatments more accurately than MRI and arthroscopic-based
macroscopic cartilage grading systems (Outerbridge, ICRS). We examine this hypothesis over the hierarchy of
PTOA therapy-development model systems including in vitro systems—Ovine cartilage explants subjected to
injury and treatment with chondroprotective drugs, engineered cartilage grafts subjected to physiologic + supra-
physiologic loading  inflammatory cytokines, and human cartilage explants from autopsy and arthroplasty
donors—and an in vivo system-- an ovine stifle joint subjected to PTOA injury, surgical repair, and drug
treatments. Through objective assessments of the efficacy of emerging cartilage therapies over the hierarchy of
R+D model systems—ex vivo, in vivo, clinical—Raman spectroscopy assessments can advance the next
generation of PTOA interventions into the clinic. The translation of Raman-based arthroscopy into a safe,
effective medical platform can be transformative for clinical practice, enabling rapid and efficient identification of
PTOA cartilage lesions and monitoring of neocartilage regeneration during routine arthroscopy."

Title: Genotoxicity and immunogenicity of the uropathogenic specific protein (usp) in the gut
Project Summary
The uropathogenic specific protein (USP) is a multi-domain protein with nuclease activity
harbored by some uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli. The protein has been shown to
cause damage to cultured endothelial cells. Although USP is primarily associated with urinary
tract, the USP gene has been found in a large percentage of fecal samples screened across
populations in Japan, USA and Puerto Rico. The presence of USP in fecal samples raises the
question of 1) whether USP is toxic to the gastrointestinal tract and 2) whether this toxicity is a
risk factor for intestinal disorders. This proposal is an effort to understand the gut-specific
activity/toxicity of purified USP. Our group has already expressed and purified a USP
protein with high nuclease activity. This R16 proposal details work that will be performed
entirely by students, in which purified USP will be used to: 1) Investigate toxicity of USP
against cultured patient-derived intestinal organoids, 2) Delineate possible mechanisms of
USP entry into cultured patient-derived intestinal organoids, and 3) Explore whether the
presence of USP in fecal samples is correlated with an anti-USP antibody response. All of the
proposed experiments will help to ascertain a possible gut-specific activity of USP, which may
impact disease risk."

transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß) superfamily of secreted signaling molecules in regulating bone mass and
density. The important role that this signaling pathway plays in regulating bone homeostasis has been
documented by both pharmacologic and genetic studies targeting receptors for this group of ligands. Work
from several groups, including ours, has shown that systemic administration of soluble forms of either of the
activin type 2 receptors, ACVR2 and ACVR2B, is capable of inducing significant increases in bone density. By
genetically targeting these receptors in osteoblasts, we showed that at least part of this effect is due to
inhibition of direct signaling to bone. Strikingly, however, we very recently showed that targeting the type 1
receptors, ALK4 and ALK5, in osteoblasts led to much more substantial effects, resulting in increases in bone
mass and density by approximately 10-fold. These findings revealed the extraordinary capacity for bone
accrual that is normally kept in check by this regulatory system and suggest that the potential for increasing
bone mass and density by targeting this signaling pathway is substantially greater than previously appreciated.
As a starting point for developing the most effective strategies to harness the potential of targeting this pathway
for bone applications, we will elucidate the extracellular components that play key roles in this regulatory
network in bone. In Specific Aim 1, we will examine the roles of known inhibitory binding proteins for this group
of ligands in regulating bone structure. In our recent study, we carried out an extensive analysis of the role of
one binding protein, namely follistatin (FST), using genetically-targeted mouse lines in which expression levels
of FST were either up- or down-regulated. Here, we will examine the roles of the three other known binding
proteins, FSTL-3, GASP-1, and GASP-2, utilizing targeted mouse lines that we have generated carrying both
deletion and floxed alleles for each of these components. In Specific Aim 2, we will examine the roles of
specific ligands in this subgroup of the TGF-ß superfamily in regulating bone structure. In our recent study, we
showed that targeting two ligands simultaneously, namely myostatin and activin A, led to substantial increases
in bone mass and density but that these increases were significantly less pronounced than the approximately
10-fold effects that we observed upon targeting their type 1 receptors. Here, we will use genetic approaches to
examine the roles of a wider spectrum of ligands in this subgroup of the TGF-ß superfamily in regulating bone
structure. The overall goal of this project will be to elucidate the specific extracellular signaling components
that play key roles in regulating bone homeostasis with the long-term goal of developing the most effective
strategies to target this signaling pathway to treat bone loss."

Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women and aging is one of the largest risk factors for the
development of breast cancer. The accumulation of oncogenic mutations within incipient tumor cells and age-
related changes in the stromal compartment may together impact tumor progression. One change that occurs in
the tumor microenvironment is the accumulation of p16INKA4 (p16) positive senescent cells which express various
cytokines, chemokines, and enzymes that all together recognized as senescence-associated secretory
phenotype (SASP) factors. While SASPs from different cell origins can exert different effects on tumorigenesis,
SASP factors secreted by senescent stromal cells can not only directly promote the proliferation of tumor cells,
but also create an immunosuppressive microenvironment that ultimately leads to more robust tumor growth. The
less ideal response to immunotherapy among breast cancer patients raises the possibilities that senescent
stromal cells could be one of the barriers protecting breast tumor cells from current immune checkpoint blockade
therapies and that the efficacy of immunotherapy can be boosted when combined with senescent cell elimination
strategies. Since immunosuppressive SASP factors are detectable in human breast cancer stroma, I hypothesize
that senescent stromal cells contribute to mammary gland tumorigenesis by modulating regulatory T cells (Tregs).
Preliminarily, I have shown that depletion of senescent stromal cells can lead to significantly delayed mammary
tumor onset in a transgenic mouse model. In addition, I have found that orthotopic mammary tumor
transplantation with senescent fibroblasts results in higher tumor burden and more Tregs infiltration. Finally, my
single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on murine and human mammary tumor/breast cancer dataset
reveals that senescence signature is highly restricted to a specific cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs)
subpopulation and this population expresses elevated levels of several Treg-inducing factors. I thus propose to
perform further scRNA-seq analysis to identify gene expression signatures of senescent CAFs across breast
cancer subtypes and understand these CAFs’ impact on tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, I will conduct in
depth tumor immunity analysis on both transgenic and orthotopic injection mouse models to discuss how tumor
immune environment is shaped by the senescent CAFs and whether depletion of senescent stromal cells, using
both genetic and pharmacological tools, can exert synergistic effect when combined with immune checkpoint
blockade therapies. These aims will not only provide a comprehensive picture of the relationship between
senescent stroma and breast cancer development, but also help me pursue my interests in immunology and
translational medicine. The training received through this proposal will also strengthen my research skills in
immunology and cancer biology. These skills will allow me to push forward my career goals of facilitating bench-
to-bedside research in cancer therapy."

Diagnostic errors, delays, and related problems have been shown to be widespread in outpatient settings.
Patient and family reports of these experiences offer a vital perspective on the scope, causes, and
consequences of these mishaps. Yet, to date, information regarding patient experiences has been quite limited
in the U.S., largely involving inpatient treatment or limited samples of patients from a few health systems or
self-selected patient advocacy groups.
This project would provide the first nationally representative estimates of Americans’ experiences with and
concerns about diagnostic safety in ambulatory care. Deploying a survey incorporating several innovative
survey methods, the study would (a) more reliably identify patient-reported safety events than in past surveys,
(b) more fully elicit patient- and family-reported narrative accounts of those events, and (c) more consistently
track the extended consequences of diagnostic problems. Data would be collected from 3,300 U.S. households
that experienced diagnostic problems between 2020 and 2025. A sample this size makes possible
comparisons across multiple settings (including newly emergent sites like urgent care clinics) and among
different subgroups of patients, including those most marginalized historically.
Because establishing an accurate, timely diagnosis is often challenging for clinicians and confounding to
patients and their families, diagnostic problems are common in every healthcare system. But American
healthcare financing and delivery systems are especially fragmented. We hypothesize that this fragmentation
elevates the risks and harms of diagnostic breakdowns, particularly in outpatient settings. The study will test
these hypothesis for three forms of insecurity induced by fragmentation (a) coverage insecurity, linked to
anxieties about what healthcare insurance will cover, (b) guidance insecurity, emerging from patients’ difficulty
identifying a clinician who can help them navigate the diagnostic process, and (c) process insecurity, emerging
when multiple clinicians and care settings are associated with the diagnosis, leaving patients with inconsistent
expectations for how the diagnostic process will unfold. Because all three forms of insecurity vary greatly within
the American healthcare, we can both empirically assess the impact of fragmentation on diagnostic outcomes
and estimate the potential benefits of reducing these three forms of fragmentation."

Since its inception, one of the foremost missions of the MIT Cancer Center has been to train the next 
generation of cancer researchers. Trainees at all levels and faculty have been actively mentored since the 
1970s. With the establishment of the Koch Institute (KI) in 2007, senior leadership has taken a proactive role in 
developing formal training opportunities across the learning spectrum from elementary students to 
undergraduates and graduate students, to post-doctoral fellows and established faculty. A full academic

Muscle regrowth and function following disuse atrophy in aged muscle is significantly compromised, and this
increases the risk for falls, long-term disability and loss of independence. Therapeutic strategies to enhance
muscle recovery are non-existent stemming from a poor understanding of cellular mechanism during regrowth
in aging muscle. Invasion of muscle macrophages and polarization to pro- and anti-inflammatory states are
critical to promote muscle stem cell function and the full resolution of muscle and function following disuse. More
recently, macrophage metabolism has been shown to be tightly coupled to the inflammatory state of activated
macrophages and regulated by transcription factors such as HIF-1α and accumulation of TCA intermediates
such as succinate. Our preliminary data in impaired aged muscle during early recovery supports decreased
macrophage succinate and HIF-1α corresponding to a reduced macrophage glycolytic and inflammatory
program and functional characteristics. Therefore, using novel mouse genetic and bone marrow transfer
experiments, along with chemical approaches and in vitro studies, we will test if succinate and HIF-1α are key
regulatory steps for macrophage metabolic and inflammatory activation during regrowth from disuse in aging
muscle and if this dysfunction arises from an aged immune system. In Aim 2, we will translate our pre-clinical
findings to young and older humans and confirm our hypothesis by extensively characterizing muscle
macrophage metabolic and inflammatory functional states in vivo and in vitro during recovery from disuse

10834090,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer begins as a disease of the genome, with DNA mutations initiating a cascade of events that lead to cancer
progression. As single or small collection of cells undergo state transitions to become cancer cells and ultimately
evolve into a malignant neoplasm, the immune system is activated and new vasculature is formed, involving
non-cancerous cells in the system. This process involves the flow and transfer of information across multiple
scales in time and space. Information is encoded within and transferred between cells and across multiple
genomic scales may be detected at the system’s level. Our hypothesis is that information contained in one or
multiple genomic landscapes can be used to detect oncogenic perturbations and predict response to therapy. It
has been shown that mutations associated with AML can be detected years before the onset of disease,
however, they do not predict when the disease will manifest or response to treatment. Nevertheless, these sets
of mutations can be characterized by distinct gene expression signatures collectively representing perturbations
underlying the observed clinical phenotypes. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel and insightful interrogations
and predictions of high-dimensional genomic data sets on a system level. Our approach aims to 1) make use of
the maximum amount of relevant information in the system 2) be simple and parsimonious with the data, and 3)
provide insight and predictions. We propose to validate a mathematical model and approach that considers
genome-wide gene activity as state transition from a healthy state to a cancer state from the perspectives of
messenger RNAs (mRNAs; transcriptome), non-coding microRNA (miRNAs; the miRome), and DNA methylation
(epigenome). The theory and mathematics of state transitions is well known in the systems biology community
and is a powerful tool for interpreting and predicting the behavior of complex systems such as genomics and
cancer biology. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that information produced during a biological process
such as cancer, can be detected from different viewpoints (i.e., transcriptome, miRome, epigenome) such that
information contained in one viewpoint of the genomic landscape can be mapped into another, and that disease
development and progression can be interpreted and predicted with mathematical models of information flow in
a multidimensional genomic space. We propose the following aims: Specific Aim 1. Parameterize a
mathematical model of multi-dimensional state transition. Specific Aim 2. Quantify the impact of treatment on
state transition dynamics and develop a model of therapy response and relapse. We will quantify and model
therapy response in controlled AML mouse model. Specific Aim 3. Characterize the information contained in
the transcriptome, miRome, and epigenome state-spaces. Impact. Through an iterative dialog between
biological experiments and mathematical modeling, this work will provide insight into perturbations contributing
to leukemia initiation and progression, which will guide the design of new therapies targeting pathways at critical
transition points."

Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is one of the leading causes of preventable death in the US and has high personal
and societal costs. Despite the widespread acceptance that evidence-based treatments exist for AUD, less
than one in nine individuals with AUD report receiving specialty treatment. Challenges are particularly acute in
disadvantaged communities. Only 60 percent of US counties have a specialty substance use disorder (SUD)
treatment clinic that accepts Medicaid, despite Medicaid being the largest payer of addiction treatment services
in the US. In 2017, The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services initiated the Certified Community
Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) demonstration, a program designed to increase access and the receipt of
evidence-based care in Medicaid in eight states. As a part of this initiative, CCBHCs were required to provide
nine services chosen to improve access; to provide data on quality metrics; and to engage in a prospective
payment system. Since the initial 66-clinic demonstration, the CCBHC program has expanded to over 240
clinics in 40 states; A primary distinction between the initial demonstration and the expanded model is that in
the expanded model clinics retain traditional reimbursement mechanisms but are awarded a large annual grant
(~$2 million). We use a quasi-experimental approach to compare changes in the receipt of AUD services
before and after CCBHC program implementation with changes in the receipt of AUD services in a set of
matched comparison clinics (or counties). Our project brings together an interdisciplinary team of health
services researchers, physicians, and economists with the methodological and substantive expertise to
examine this understudied issue and explore its complex public health, clinical, and policy implications. Our
specific aims are to assess whether CCBHC implementation was associated with: 1a) Changes in AUD
identification and treatment quality; 1b) Differential changes in AUD identification and treatment quality in
demonstration versus expansion clinics; 2) Differential changes in AUD treatment receipt and quality during the
COVID-19 public health emergency in CCBHC compared to non-CCBHC clinics; and 3) Changes in
trajectories of public health outcomes, including county-level reports of crime and alcohol-involved fatal motor
vehicle accidents. This grant is responsive to NOT-AA-20-022, “Notice of Special Interest: Advances in
Research for the Treatment, Services, and Recovery of Alcohol Use Disorder” and will provide
information ‘to bridge the gap between those who need treatment and those who receive treatment.’ In
addition, we focus on the Medicaid program, which disproportionately serves NIH-designated US health
disparity populations. The significance of this study lies in its focus on how to optimize delivery systems to
improve treatment and outcomes associated with AUD, a growing challenge and understudied policy issue."

Disordered repetitive patterns of behavior and thought characterize numerous neuropsychiatric conditions,
including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (TS) and other tic disorders.
Obsessions, compulsions, and tics are associated with dysregulation of the cortico-basal ganglia circuitry, but
the underlying pathophysiological details remain poorly understood.
Several lines of evidence implicate dysregulation of dopamine (DA) and its receptors in TS and OCD, but much
remains unclear, especially in OCD. New insight has arisen from our recent studies in a mouse model of the
pathophysiology of a rare genetic form of TS and OCD associated with a mutation in the Hdc gene. Parallel
studies in these mice (ex vivo 3H raclopride binding) and in a small number of adult carriers of the Hdc
mutation with TS (11C-PHNO PET imaging) revealed upregulation of D2/D3 receptors in the substantia nigra,
where previous work suggests that D3 upregulation may represent a response to chronic DA excess, and in
the globus pallidus (GP). In unrelated subjects with OCD, 11C-PHNO PET imaging revealed a distinct pattern:
increased binding to D2/D3 receptors in the SN but not in the GP, and a previously uncharacterized increase in
the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens. We speculate that dysregulated DA signaling in the accumbens may
contribute to abnormal reward processing, which we have recently characterized in individuals with OCD.
These pilot data are not sufficient powered for definitive conclusions; they require confirmation, which the
current proposal seeks to achieve. Our tentative finding of overlapping but distinct patterns of DA receptor
abnormality in two related neuropsychiatric conditions sets the stage for an important comparative study.
We will perform 11C-PHNO PET imaging in 60 adult subjects: 15 with OCD, 15 with TS/tics, 15 with both OCD
and tics (which are frequently comorbid), and 15 healthy controls. This will permit us to perform several
analyses, all firmly grounded in our pilot data. First, we will compare individuals with and without tics; we
expect to find increased D2/D3 binding in the SN and GP, which would extend our findings in carriers of the
rare TS-associated Hdc mutation to tic patients more generally and thus constitute a rare instance of true
translation from an animal model of pathophysiology to new insight in humans. Second, we will compare
individuals with and without OCD; we expect receptor abnormalities in the ventral striatum to be related to
OCD symptomatology, while binding in the GP will be associated with tic comorbidity. Finally, we will use
continuous symptom measures across the full dataset, characterizing patterns of D2/D3 abnormality that may
cut across traditional diagnostic categories.
These studies bring together new findings with state-of-the-art methodologies to advance our understanding of
how dysregulation in DA and its receptors contributes to disordered repetitive patterns of behavior and thought
in two common neuropsychiatric disorders."

The University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC), Duke University and Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center (MSKCC) seek support for establishing the analytical and clinical validity of a Circulating Tumor
Cell (CTC) biomarker assay via the UH2/UH3 mechanism. This biomarker assay will evaluate a gene expression
signature of treatment resistant, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
While many patients with prostate cancer benefit from Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibitors (ARSIs), a subset
of patients do not respond to this class of treatments while nearly all others develop resistance within 1-2 years.
Identified mechanisms of resistance include development of Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer (NEPC) and
expression of Androgen Receptor Splicing Variants (AR-Vs). Early detection of NEPC or AR-Vs as drivers of
treatment resistant prostate cancer would eliminate the need to wait for clinical manifestations of resistance,
accelerating the time to administration of more suitable therapy and increasing survival.
While precision medicine approaches are increasing in popularity and reliability, their ultimate capacity to
improve patient care hinges on their diagnostic accuracy. Realization of a clinically relevant assay requires
thorough analytical and clinical evaluation, and while many biomarker assays have successfully demonstrated
analytical performance, failure to address clinical utility has left many unable to improve on existing diagnostics.
By focusing our efforts on evaluation of both analytical and clinical validity, we aim to provide diagnostic accuracy
in assessing an expression of NEPC and AR-Vs, building a necessary foundation for future clinical trials.
To that end, we have optimized a multi-plexed gene expression assay on CTCs, that identifies these two major
categories of resistance to ARSIs. This assay has shown promising initial results in a preliminary cohort of
patients with aggressive CRPC. Optimization of this assay has taken into consideration the rarity of CTCs and
the diversity of other blood cells in circulation; ensuring efficient RNA extraction, probe specificity, and
appropriate data interpretation. The manipulation and retention of rare cells is enabled by our Exclusion-based
Sample Preparation (ESP) technology, wherein centrifugation and wash steps are eliminated. This automated
and commercially available platform, also called the Gilson ExtractMax, offers minimal user variability, thus
maximizing precision. Our collaboration with Dr. Kaitlin Sundling at the Wisconsin State Lab of Hygiene, a CAP-
approved clinical testing laboratory, provides expert oversight for planning and execution of analytical validation.
In collaboration with Dr. Andrew Armstrong, Dr. Susan Halabi and Dr. Dana Rathkopf, we have assembled a
team of clinical researchers and biostatisticians to rapidly validate this multi-plexed biomarker in a prospective
study. This RNA-based CTC assay shows potential for identifying treatment resistant prostate cancer in
preliminary studies of patients and is thus poised for success in both analytical and clinical validation."
10849555,"Many aspects of human health and disease are genetically complex; that is, they arise from multiple
interactions between genetic, developmental, and environmental factors. Understanding this complexity is the
basis of personalized medicine. Unfortunately, human genetic studies are still limited in a number of ways
including inadequate, retrospective medical records, formidable sample size requirements, insufficient
statistical power to study genetic interactions, and insufficient mechanistic information about many genes.
These obstacles are easily addressed using non-human, mammalian models, such as mice, that are designed
for fine scale dissection of genetic complexity, i.e. systems genetics. The biomedical research community has
made a significant investment in the genetically diverse inbred strains and genetic reference populations of
mice as tools for systems genetics research.
This proposal requests ongoing support for The Special Mouse Strain Resource (SMSR) at The Jackson
Laboratory. The SMSR serves as the biorepository for these unique sets of strains, ensuring permanent and
open access from high health status, quality-controlled, state-of-the-art facilities. The resource currently
consists of more than 300 strains, including the widely used BXD and Collaborative Cross strain panels, but
importantly, the strains available in the SMSR are changed and developed as dictated by the needs of
research community.
The major activities of the SMSR are to: i) archive, maintain, and distribute these strains to qualified biomedical
researchers, ii) provide complete, accurate and accessible information related to the mouse resources, iii)
confer with an external advisory board of thought leaders from the complex trait community to define current
and future resources, iv) provide leadership in best practices for research and reproducibility using SMSR
resources.
The SMSR also provides infrastructure, outreach and collaborative opportunities for the development of new
tools for complex trait analysis, as well as access to existing strains and populations for large-scale multicenter
projects; and conducts research to expand tools for genetic engineering of specialized mapping strains."

Inadvertent fetal exposure to excess steroids or steroid mimics poses risks to reproductive and metabolic
health in humans. At risk is the offspring whose mother has elevated levels of endogenous or exogenous
steroids during pregnancy for a variety of reasons, including disease states and exposure to environmental
compounds with steroidogenic activity. Experimental manipulation of the fetal steroid environment provides a
powerful tool not only to unravel the mechanisms underlying the development of reproductive dysfunction and
infertility, but also to develop intervention strategies to improve reproduction and prevent transmission of
undesirable traits to subsequent generations. Our studies using sheep as the animal model demonstrated that
prenatal exposure to excess testosterone from days 30-90 of pregnancy leads to reproductive neuroendocrine,
ovarian and metabolic perturbations in the female offspring that recapitulate those seen in women with
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). These perturbations include oligo-anovulation, multifollicular ovarian
morphology, functional hyperandrogenism, and insulin resistance. Furthermore, excess postnatal weight gain
exacerbated the severity of such dysfunctions in female sheep prenatally exposed to testosterone excess. With
mounting evidence supporting that developmentally-programmed traits are transmitted across multiple
generations, elucidating the mechanisms by which reproductive and metabolic dysfunctions are passed on to
the next generation in the sheep model of PCOS may help develop intervention strategies to alleviate adverse
multigenerational effects and improve the health of subsequent generations. Using the day 60 to 90 gestational
testosterone exposure model that allows natural mating (female offspring are not virilized like the 30-90 day
exposure model), this proposal tests the novel hypotheses that: 1) prenatal testosterone excess promotes
epigenetic, molecular, and functional alterations at multiple levels of the reproductive and metabolic systems
that will carry over to subsequent generations, thus contributing to the vertical transmission of disease traits;
and 2) lifestyle modifications via dietary intervention will considerably mitigate expression of these adverse
events and will protect the second-generation (F2) offspring from inheriting several reproductive and metabolic
defects programmed by prenatal testosterone excess and aggravated by increased adiposity. The studies
proposed in this application target the developmental origins of adult disease and focus on a large animal
model of translational relevance that exhibits a developmental trajectory that parallels that of humans. Because
gestational exposure to excess steroids due to maternal disease and/or environmental factors impairs fertility,
the findings from these studies will provide crucial biological information for improving reproduction across
generations and will be of relevance in meeting the scientific missions of NIH."

Mental health disorders are a major cause of disability in the US and more broadly throughout the rest of the
world. The impact of mental illness extends to other aspects of human health and disease and significantly
reduces life expectancy. As new technologies emerge for assessing mental health disorders, and as research
designs become increasingly complex, the Department of Biostatistics at Columbia University, in partnership
with leading scholars at Columbia’s Department of Psychiatry and New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI),
has developed an innovative program to train predoctoral scholars in biostatistical methods, machine learning,
data science, and interdisciplinary research in order to meet the emerging challenges brought by cutting edge
technologies. Our training program, built on the expertise of the program mentors and resources at the
Department of Psychiatry, NYSPI, and Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) has three goals
tailored toward mental health research. The first training goal focuses on core, foundational skills of biostatistics
and data science. Many modern tools have become especially invaluable in mental health research, including
causal inference, innovative designs of clinical trials (e.g., sequential multiple assignment randomized trials;
SMARTs), and observational studies (e.g., electronic health records; EHRs), psychometrics, latent variable
modeling, and machine learning (supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning).
Foundational training in these methods is essential to next-generation mental health statisticians. The second
training goal provides the best possible individualized training, where each trainee will create a personalized
training plan (PTP) that specifies their choice among three elements. These include (a) computational psychiatry,
which encompasses advanced machine learning methods for high-dimensional, complex, or big data; (b)
methods for precision medicine in mental health; and (c) methods under the Research domain criteria (RDoC)
framework. The third goal trains candidates to gain interdisciplinary research experiences. The best biostatistical
collaborators are those with broad knowledge of mental health issues (e.g., familiar with RDoC concepts;
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual diagnoses) who are also effective and experienced communicators fluent in
the language of mental health. Trainees will thus be prepared to partner with other researchers in mental health
to make meaningful contributions towards achieving the goals of improving basic understanding of mental health
conditions, optimizing treatment strategies, and reducing the incidence of mental health disorders."

State-of-the-Art Preclinical PET/CT Imaging System
Yale University PET Center
The goal of this proposal is to replace an end-of-life Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
preclinical imaging system with a state-of-the-art PET/CT system that will enhance preclinical
imaging research at the Yale PET Center. PET imaging provides a unique non-invasive method
to detect and quantify biochemical processes and physiological functions in the living body. PET
imaging has broad applications in areas of oncology, cardiology, psychiatry, neurology,
metabolic disorders, inflammation, and others. The Yale PET Center is a 100% research
dedicated core facility that features radiopharmaceutical development for diverse biological
targets and high-resolution imaging with state-of-the-art quantification. Preclinical PET imaging
research is essential to support novel radiopharmaceutical probe development and mechanistic
studies not possible in humans. These studies, conducted in diverse species including mouse,
rat, bird, rabbit, dog, and nonhuman primates, benefit and advance the entire PET research
enterprise. However, the current preclinical PET-only system has reached end-of-life and lacks
CT capabilities, motivating the need for a new state-of-the-art preclinical PET/CT imaging
system. We have identified a proposed PET/CT system large enough to accommodate
nonhuman primate imaging that exhibits high sensitivity, high resolution, and excellent
quantitative accuracy. When these PET instrumentation characteristics are combined with a CT
scanner with rapid acquisition speed, the system will provide ideal characteristics for the
preclinical PET/CT research studies of Yale investigators. The preclinical PET/CT system will
improve spatial localization of new radiopharmaceutical probes, allow image-based
measurement of tracer input function, and provide proper measurement of whole-body imaging
data including correction for cardiac and respiratory motion. The proposed instrument will
support 19 NIH-funded investigators in the Departments of Cardiology, Internal Medicine,
Neurology, Neuroscience, Psychiatry, and Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, all of whom are
currently conducting NIH-funded PET imaging research. The additional capabilities and capacity
provided by the new system will also support the development of PET imaging research by new
investigators. Enhanced use of novel radiopharmaceuticals and PET/CT imaging will promote
research studying new mechanisms for diagnosis and therapy of human disease. Together,
these applications hold tremendous potential to advance public health."

This proposal requests funds to acquire a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster with extensive data storage
and Graphics Co-Processor (GCP) capabilities for the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) to support
artificial intelligence (AI) based research integrating institutional laboratory, clinical, imaging and genomic data
resources. MUSC is dramatically expanding its “raw materials'' for AI research: electronic health records (EHR)
data from an expanding (now statewide) healthcare system; clinical and research-based imaging data stored in
a common format in a new PACS (picture archiving and communications system); and deep genomic data
(~100,000 over the next four years). These data create a unique opportunity along with a need for advanced
HPC capabilities to expand existing research projects using these data resources.
AI and specifically machine learning has led to groundbreaking biomedical studies, but requires HPC, robust
graphics processing units (GPUs) and large accessible storage. Currently, a number of NIH-funded investigators
at MUSC are performing research utilizing big data and machine learning, capturing massive amounts of data.
Unfortunately, these highly valuable data sets are disjointed and siloed due to a lack of an adequate, unified
data storage solution that can facilitate translational linking of these data sets.
Growing unmet computational need is also a common theme among these NIH-funded investigators, particularly
in areas of research involving high-volume, high-resolution image acquisition. Currently, inadequate access to
high performance computing and the necessary AI infrastructure limit their ability to apply techniques such as
deep learning to unlock a more complete value from these data sets. These data sets are often of a size and
complexity such that it is impractical to transmit, store and compute upon them using cloud resources, requiring
local HPC “instruments” to perform the computational tasks required. Building upon an existing MUSC
institutional initiatives, proposal adds AI computational infrastructure to the socio-technical resources available
at MUSC and to pilot level computational resources. The proposed HPC cluster will unify these efforts by
providing common data storage with ample and accessible computing power for sophisticated AI techniques
(e.g. deep learning) to exploit the potential synergies among data sets and facilitate translation efforts. The HPC

Replacing the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) system with the new Illumina
NovaSeq X Plus NGS system will improve services provided by the UAMS Genomics Core Facility to all users
by: i) reducing the cost of sequencing by up to ~80% compared to the current system (NovaSeq 6000), ii)
accommodating advanced chemistries allowing for NGS read lengths up to 7KB and thus improving the
specificity of NGS findings, and iii) allowing for the storage of NGS reagents at room temperature versus
refrigeration. The NovaSeq X Plus system will reside in the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS)
Genomics Core Facility, which is an important resource for faculty and students in Arkansas who are engaged
in research that impacts human health. The mission of the UAMS Genomics Core Facility is to provide
investigators with convenient access, at affordable prices, to the latest technologies for advanced molecular
profiling of biological samples. Importantly, this includes NGS-based studies, experiments, and assays.
Services are provided to investigators at UAMS, other universities in Arkansas including faculty and students
from undergraduate institutions in the Arkansas INBRE network, and importantly NIH Institutional Development
Award (IDeA) centers in Arkansas. Three funded IDeA center grants on the UAMS campus that will be a part of
the major users group, which will occupy the bulk of time on this new instrument are: i) the Center for
Translational Pediatric Research (P20GM121293), ii) the Center for Musculoskeletal Disease Research
(P20GM125503) and, iii) the Center for Studies of Host Response to Cancer Therapy (P20GM109005).
Additional members of the major user group will predominately be involved with research activities related to
obtaining NCI Cancer Center designation for UAMS. Services provided by the UAMS Genomics Core may be
“all inclusive” and consist of consultation and in-person meeting(s) concerning an investigator’s question
(hypothesis) along with assistance and guidance for an experimental design. Initial meetings are essential in
order to manage new users’ expectations and foster their success. Additional NGS service components include:
i) sample preparation with QA/QC validation, ii) running the sample on the NGS instrument and, iii) bioinformatics
pipeline processing (data analysis). The UAMS Genomics Core Facility is fully supported and supplemented by
the UAMS Rockefeller Cancer Institute and the College of Medicine. State-of-the-art genomic scientific
instrumentation is essential to facilitate novel research (eg, advanced liquid biopsy assays) for faculty and
students in Arkansas. The goal of obtaining NCI Cancer Center Designation by UAMS will be strengthened by
the addition of the NovaSeq X Plus NGS system."

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitors are tightly regulated by both cell intrinsic mechanisms and the
microenvironment (also known as niches) created by specialized bone marrow (BM) stromal cells. However,
how stem cell or progenitor niches are developed, maintained, and remodeled in response to stress is poorly
characterized. Lack of such fundamental knowledge hinders our ability to understand certain hematological
diseases directly or indirectly involving the BM microenvironment. HSCs, the precursor cells that give rise to all
blood lineages, are maintained in discrete anatomical microenvironments during embryonic development, and
they ultimately migrate from the fetal liver to the BM (“homing”) at the perinatal stage. Yet our understanding of
the mechanisms regulating this process remains limited. We previously demonstrated a crucial cell-intrinsic role
of PTPMT1, a mitochondria-based Pten-like phosphatidylinositol phosphate phosphatase, in hematopoietic cell
development − Knockout of PTPMT1 from the hematopoietic system resulted in hematopoietic failure due to the
bioenergetic/metabolic stress, cell cycle arrest, and differentiation block of HSCs. Using the PTPMT1 knockout
model, we recently examined the role of coordinated cellular metabolism in the stem cell microenvironment by
generating and characterizing PTPMT1fl/fl/Prx1-Cre+ mice, in which PTPMT1 was deleted from BM stromal cells
(and limb bud progenitor-derived other mesenchymal cells). Surprisingly, deletion of PTPMT1 from BM stromal
cells resulted in profound hematopoietic defects: 1). Nearly eighty percent of PTPMT1fl/fl/Prx1-Cre+ mice died
within 3 weeks of birth. The migration/homing of HSCs (wild-type) from the fetal liver to the BM was impaired in
these animals – HSCs in the BM of knockout mice decreased by ~5-fold compared to those in control mice 2
weeks after birth, while there were ~13 times more hematopoietic foci (CD45+) in the liver of knockout mice. 2).
B lymphocyte development was blocked in the pro-B stage in PTPMT1fl/fl/Prx1-Cre+ mice. These striking
observations led us to hypothesize that PTPMT1-mediated metabolism plays an important role in establishing or
maintaining supportive stem cell niches in the BM. The objective of the current proposal is to further determine
the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. By studying this particular mitochondrial protein, we aim to
decipher the metabolic regulation of HSC niche development/maintenance/remodeling. We plan to test our
hypothesis by pursuing the following three aims. 1). To identify the niche cells in which PTPMT1 depletion-
induced bioenergetic/metabolic stress causes HSC homing defects during perinatal development. 2). To
determine the functional relevance of PTPMT1-mediated metabolism in HSC niche cells to steady-state and
stress hematopoiesis in adults. 3). To identify the bioactive molecules that account for the effects of PTPMT1-
depletion from the niche on HSCs, and the mechanisms by which PTPMT1 deficiency reprograms cellular
metabolism."

The burden of cancer disproportionally affects children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which
accounts for over 80% of global childhood cancer cases and deaths. Children in LMICs are four times more
likely to die of cancer than children in high-income countries. One of the main reasons impacting poor
outcomes for vast number of children with cancer in LMICs is the lack of strong health systems, which impacts
timely access to care along the entire care continuum. In order to improve cancer outcomes for children in
LMICs, interventions are needed to improve comprehensive care
using a health system strengthening
approach
. My long-term goal is to improve outcomes for children with cancer in LMICs through support of
locally-relevant programs to strengthen health systems. I am a global health epidemiologist with a passion for
children’s health care in LMICs. Although my formal training and research experiences have been formative for
the analysis of disease patterns and health systems, I will use this award to develop skills to improve health
systems and to translate epidemiologic data into clinical practice. With my extensive epidemiologic experience,
I have previously measured and identified delays in care for children with surgical needs in LMICs due to
geographic, financial, and health system barriers. However, I lack the expertise to translate those findings into
practice through real-world, evidence-based, sustainable solutions. Training in this gap between science and
practice requires an integrated approach to health system strengthening. To achieve my career goals, I need
additional training in health services research and implementation science. The skills acquired during the K01
training grant will equip me to become an independent investigator in low-income settings with my career goal
of becoming researcher to improve global health systems for children. My mentorship team’s expertise in
global care for children, health services research, implementation science, and intervention development will
support my proposed training and research objectives. In addition, the proposed aims will gather preliminary
data needed for the next step of a R01 proposal aimed at testing interventions to improve cancer care for
children in Tanzania."
10841049,"Summary/Abstract
 The human cerebral cortex contains an astonishing diversity of cell types distributed across dozens of
functional areas, which emerge during early development for an apparently uniform neuroepithelium. It has long
been hypothesized that genetic mutations underlying brain development abnormalities and genes implicated in
neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders can impact brain development in a variety of ways, but we currently
lack scalable tools for interrogating their impact on the development of specialized cell types.
 Astrocytes represent a highly diverse cell class that is broadly categorized into a handful of cardinal types.
Astrocytes emerge in late development, and selective vulnerabilities of astrocyte subtypes to mutations or
environmental perturbations may underlie distinct phenotypes in psychiatric disorders or in Zika virus infection.
However, developmental origins, molecular characteristics, and mechanisms of subtype specification are poorly
understood. We currently lack experimental methods to study human astrocyte subtypes and their development.
 Our preliminary data suggest that at mid-gestation, radial glia subtypes may be biased towards generating
different subtypes of human astrocytes. In the proposed project we propose to extend this finding by mapping
the temporal dynamics of cellular differentiation from radial glia subtypes across multiple stages of development.
We will also determine whether similar developmental dynamics take place in ferret, which could serve as a
substitute to human tissue and enable in vivo functional studies.
 Secondly, we will determine developmental lineage relationships between cortical radial glia subtypes and
astrocyte subtypes. Our preliminary studies predict morphologically distinct subtypes of astrocytes emerge from
anatomically distinct germinal niches, and we propose to directly register these morphotypes to transcriptomic
identities using single cell mRNA sequencing.
 Finally, our goal is to understand whether distinct radial glia subtypes contribute distinct cell types of the
cerebral cortex. To address this question, we propose to perform xenotransplantation experiments into mouse
brain. We will combine this approach with single cell sequencing, and in silico analyses co-embedding our data
with existing resources from adult human cortex to reveal what molecular subtypes may emerge from
transcriptomically- distinct subtypes of cortical progenitor cells."
10841051,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Variation in survival and reproduction is due largely to variation in polygenic traits.
Therefore, identifying the genetic basis of adaptive divergence in complex phenotypes is
of paramount importance not only in evolutionary biology, but also in the study and
treatment of human disease. Few studies have been able to identify the individual genes
that underlie adaptive differences in quantitative traits. The overarching goal of this work
is to identify the individual loci involved in quantitative trait variation and link those loci
to fitness in natural populations. Previous efforts have fallen short either because (1)
quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping studies provided limited resolution and failed to
pinpoint particular genes, or (2) the effects of variation in candidate genes and traits on
fitness could not be tested in natural populations. The proposed work will overcome these
limitations in two ways. First, to identify individual loci involved in ecologically relevant
complex traits such as phenology, mating system, and morphology, we plan to combine
QTL mapping in advanced generation hybrids with genome wide association studies and
population genomic scans for selection in natural populations. Second, we will perform
reciprocal transplant studies using genetically recombinant individuals to causally link
genetic variation in quantitative traits to variation in fitness in native habitats. The Mimulus
guttatus species complex is an ideal system in which to study the genetics of adaptation in
quantitative traits because it is an ecologically diverse, experimentally tractable, and highly
inter-fertile group of wildflowers with many genetic and genomic tools. Using this
combination of approaches in Mimulus will allow us to address the following fundamental
evolutionary questions: What is the genetic architecture of local adaptation under spatially
and temporally varying selection? Is evolution in complex traits predictable at the
molecular level? What is the genetic basis of genotype by environment interactions? Our
work uses a powerful integrative approach to examine the evolution of complex traits in
natural populations. How quantitative traits respond to environmental variation in time and
space has important implications for the evolution of complex diseases and agriculturally
important plants and animals in a changing climate."
10840964,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is estimated to cause 4-5 million deaths per year worldwide. In patients with heart
failure, SCD is the number one leading cause of death and is linked to the onset of ventricular arrhythmias.
Understanding how ventricular arrhythmias arise in patients with heart failure is thus critical to designing
effective drugs that prevent SCD and prolong survival in patients with heart failure. In ventricular
cardiomyocytes, the foundation of excitation-contraction coupling is intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Specifically,
activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels cause Ca2+ release from the SR via Ca2+ release channels resulting
in local increases in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] known as “sparks.” Sparks then sum to generate global increases in
cytoplasmic [Ca2+] across the cell called Ca2+ transients. Under normal circumstances, this is a tightly
controlled and coordinated process that leads to synchronous contraction of the ventricles. When disturbed,
however, dyssynchronous Ca2+ release across the cell, known as Ca2+ waves, can lead to uncoordinated
ventricular contraction i.e. arrhythmia.
When studying conditions that are technically challenging—such as visualizing the arrangement of individual
Ca2+ release channels on the SR—or investigating conditions that cannot be easily manipulated—such as
studying how changing that arrangement affects probability of arrhythmogenic wave formation—computational
modeling becomes very useful. Such variables can be easily manipulated to predict experimentally measurable
outcomes. While modeling has been used to study Ca2+ sparks and waves previously, current mathematical
models make several assumptions about the subcellular properties of Ca2+ release units. More specifically,
they assume that only ryanodine receptors are responsible for SR Ca2+ release while ignoring IP3 receptors,
which are lowly expressed in healthy ventricular myocytes and show increased expression in failing myocytes.
They also assume homogeneous dyadic geometry and spatial arrangement of channels between release sites.
While it is known that properties such as the number of release channels in a release unit are variable in
healthy myocytes, these effects as well as changes to dyadic geometry become especially prominent in failing
ventricular myocytes in which remodeling has occurred, and should thus be included in models.
Given the immense clinical need to understand how changes to ventricular myocytes in heart failure
predisposes to arrhythmia and SCD yet the difficulty in experimentally manipulating important spatial and
geometric changes found in failing myocytes, there is a clear need for accurate mathematical models of
intracellular Ca2+ signaling in failing compared to healthy myocytes. I plan to address this need by developing
more accurate models of Ca2+ sparks and Ca2+ waves that account for (1) heterogeneity in Ca2+ release units
and (2) the expression of IP3 receptors in both healthy and diseased ventricular myocytes. I will then refine
these models based on in vitro experimental findings."

The program’s overarching goal is to understand key pathways in the biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis –
the pathogen that kills more people than any other worldwide. It will focus on complex pathways that are
important in adaptation to disease-relevant stressors, by using advanced genetic and biochemical methods that
the collaborators have developed. The work will be done by a team of collaborative investigators, organized into
four distinct but interrelated projects, and supported by four cores. Careful project management will be essential
to the success of this program. The Administrative Core will provide this project management and is a key

10841652,"Core C, Abstract
 Even though it has been over 20 years since the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) was first
sequenced, the functions of over half the genes in the genome remain unknown (or unclear). Additional sources
of information (beyond homology) are needed to generate a better understanding of the specific biological roles
Mtb genes play in basic cellular processes and infection. In this program project, four disease-relevant pathways
will be studied: metabolic response to acidic stress, biotin biosynthesis, RNA processing, and cell division. The
four experimental methods that the Projects will rely heavily on are transposon sequencing (TnSeq; essentiality),
RNAseq (transcriptomics), Activity-Based Metabolomic Profiling (ABMP), and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi).
TnSeq and RNAseq will be applied to knockout or knockdown strains of target genes to assess the intracellular
responses to these perturbations and infer novel gene functions and pathway associations. Sequencing of
transposon insertion libraries (TnSeq) provides a powerful method for probing the functions and relationships
among genes through conditional essentiality and genetic interactions. CRISPRi will be used to generate
knockdown strains to validate phenotypes predicted by TnSeq. Transcriptomic data yields information on co-
expression, which can be used to infer functional relationships, e.g. through regulatory networks. ABMP provides
direct information on gene functions through changes in metabolite concentrations (e.g. possible substrates or
products) when purified protein is incubated in lysate.
 The role of the Bioinformatics and Data Sharing Core is to assist the Projects with rigorous statistical
analyses of these data. Specifically, in Activity 1 the Core will conduct bioinformatic analysis of various 'omics
datatypes to identify novel genes in the target pathways and define their functional roles. In Activity 2 the Core
will apply Machine Learning algorithms to integrate these diverse 'omics datatypes and build predictive models
that can be used to identify new genes in these pathways and predict their functions. Finally, under Activity 3 the
Bioinformatics and Data Sharing Core will serve as a centralized conduit for data sharing; including depositing
datasets in appropriate public repositories, and posting data on an Mtb-dedicated website they have developed."
10841594,"Over the past eight years, my lab has pioneered studies of the acoustic communication system of Drosophila,
to address fundamental questions related to the neural mechanisms underlying sensory perception and the
generation of behaviors. Similar to other animals, flies produce and process patterned sounds during their
mating ritual. Using a combination of novel behavioral assays, neural circuit perturbations, neural recordings,
and computational modeling, we discovered that male song structure and intensity are continually sculpted by
interactions with the female, over timescales ranging from tens of milliseconds to minutes. Building on this
finding, we have gone on to dissect the neural mechanisms underlying the visual modulation of song patterning
in males. Using a similar set of tools, we have also interrogated the female side of acoustic communication,
and have successfully related song representations along the auditory pathway to changes in locomotor
behavior, again across multiple timescales. My lab has developed several new methods to facilitate these
studies, including methods for tracking and segmenting animal behavior, for population neural imaging, and for
single-cell transcriptomics in the Drosophila brain. Our system and discoveries lay the essential foundation for
now solving the bigger challenge of how an animal's internal state and experiences contribute to shaping these
neural mechanisms. To do so, we will employ new computational models to identify the neural correlates of
internal state. We will also use a new paradigm to induce learning during acoustic communication, and will
characterize how learning shapes sensorimotor integration in this system. Finally, we will manipulate the
hunger or arousal status of flies to determine, again at the cellular level, how long timescale modulation of
neural activity shapes fast timescale sensorimotor processes. These new research directions will leverage the
methods we have optimized for the recording and analysis of neural and behavioral data, in addition to
incorporating new methods for recording activity in behaving flies that experience naturalistic, multimodal
courtship stimuli timed to their movements on a spherical treadmill. What we discover in this system will reveal
fundamental principles regarding how brains mediate perceptions, thoughts, actions, and ultimately the ability
to communicate with another individual."

This revised K24 will enable me to optimize HIV prevention among opioid-dependent persons through three broad and
interrelated aims that include: (1) Mentoring a greater number of new patient-oriented researchers via UConn’s Institute for
Collaboration on Health, Intervention, and Policy (InCHIP) and the Yale AIDS Program, (2) Expanding my patient-oriented
research (POR) program to include several high priority domestic (e.g., rural West Virginia/Ohio) and international settings
(e.g., Uganda, Malaysia, and Ukraine), and (3) Engaging in structured training on critical issues surrounding the
implementation of evidence-based HIV prevention within clinical settings nationally and internationally that will complement
my POR skill set. The volatile opioid epidemic in the U.S. has taken an unimaginable toll, with 2.1 million Americans having
an opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose deaths reaching 70,200 in 2017 alone, representing over a 400% increase in 15
years.1 In parallel, a number of HIV outbreaks among people who inject drugs (PWID)2 reversed a downward trend in this
group,1 reflecting the need to more effectively prevent HIV in this group, especially as patients with OUD transition from
prescription pain killers to injectable opioids.3 Consequently, the CDC has intensified efforts to reduce the number of new
HIV infections by more effectively and efficiently targeting PWID via: 1) reduced HIV risk behaviors, 2) increased adherence
and retention in treatment; and 3) promotion of health behaviors that benefit individual and public health. Although drug- and
sex-related HIV risk reduction and adherence are behaviors that are readily modifiable, interventions must be carefully
designed and situated in a range of patient-oriented settings in the US and internationally.4-8 I am in the process of expanding
my POR to focus on better identifying, understanding, and developing strategies at multiple levels to accommodate such
patients so that they can derive optimal HIV prevention benefits via the next generation of interventions (e.g., mHealth).9
Such strategies will need to reinforce adherence to PrEP and other biomedical prevention (e.g., opioid agonist therapies [OAT]
and syringe services programs [SSP]) alongside behavioral risk reduction. This will be especially important as priority domestic
and international communities struggle with their inability to overcome policy factors that limit or restrict access to the full
toolkit of HIV prevention (i.e., PrEP, OAT, SSP, behavioral interventions) for PWID. My ongoing (R01DA044867; Gilead
ISR-US-19-10641), recently completed (R01DA032290; R01DA022122), and future HIV prevention projects form the basis of
my POR and mentoring program as well as future domestic and international research collaborations. Each of the aims will
provide a wide range of opportunities for expanding my POR and for my mentees to develop the skill set they need to become
the next generation of HIV prevention scientists."

This project uses PSP as a model disorder to study early interventions for symptomatic treatment to improve
balance and postural instability in parkinsonian disorders. The goal of this research is to develop effective
therapies for postural instability and falls in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). PSP is a form of parkinsonism
classically characterized by early and severe balance deficits, primarily backward postural instability. Injuries
related to this debilitating postural instability in PSP, or risk-avoidance aimed at preventing such incidents, limit
mobility and physical therapy, which, in turn, leads to a further decline in function. The traditional symptomatic
treatments for bradykinesia and rigidity in parkinsonism (dopaminergic medication and stimulation of the basal
ganglia circuitry via deep brain stimulation) are not helpful for backward postural instability in PSP, or in advanced
Parkinson’s disease. We know that the cerebellum’s normal ability to inhibit and modulate motor output for
postural control is diminished in parkinsonian disorders. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the effect
of non-invasive repetitive cerebellar transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on postural instability in
progressive supranuclear (PSP). The central hypothesis is that augmenting cerebellar inhibition via cerebellar
rTMS will decrease postural instability in patients with PSP by increasing functional connectivity between the
cerebellum, thalamus, and primary motor cortex. Aim 1 uses a specialized force plate platform and wearable
sensors to evaluate objective posturography measures of postural stability before and after rTMS. Aim 2
identifies changes in cerebellar, thalamic, and motor cortex functional activity before and after resting state fMRI.
If successful, this proof-of-concept study for cerebellar neuromodulation in PSP will lead to better rehabilitation
strategies, and cerebellar neuromodulation via TMS may also lead to more durable neuromodulation approaches
for postural instability, such as cerebellar targeting for future deep brain stimulation paradigms. The candidate
for this K23 Career Development Award has a long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator
in the field neuromodulation for symptomatic management of balance impairment and of other untreatable
aspects of parkinsonism. With the outstanding mentorship of Dr. Fay Horak (quantitative gait and balance
research), and co-mentored by Dr. Bill Rooney (fMRI), Dr. Joseph Quinn (clinical trials and PSP), and Dr. Mark
George (neuromodulation), a comprehensive training plan for quantitative research methods and fMRI analysis
is proposed. In a future RO1, Dr. Dale will pair cerebellar rTMS with rehabilitation programs for postural instability
and expand investigations of TMS as a probe of the neural circuitry for motor control in parkinsonism."
10842590,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Nearly every aspect of cellular function—from development to metabolism and signaling—requires that
membrane proteins be targeted to the correct location in the cell. This process requires high specificity as
different cargoes are destined for different destinations. Although the basic steps of this process are known (i.e.,
cargoes are sorted into vesicles, the proper kinesins are recruited, and kinesins then transport vesicles to the
proper destination), our current understanding of the mechanisms by which kinesins are recruited to vesicles
and how their action is regulated on vesicles in live cells is extremely limited. Previously, the field lacked many
of the tools needed to better characterize and understand these mechanisms, but our group has developed
several cutting-edge tools that allow us for the first time to answer several fundamentally important questions. In
this project, we will apply our experience with these tools in combination with primary hippocampal neuron culture
and live cell imaging to achieve four key goals: 1) determine the mechanisms of on-vesicle regulation for kinesin-
mediated transport, using Kinesin-3 family member KIF13A as an initial model, 2) identify molecular links
between cargo sorting and kinesin recruitment, 3) determine the mechanisms that underlie the sorting of
polarized cargoes at the trans-Golgi network, and 4) develop additional molecular tools in pursuit of these goals
that also have applicability to the broader trafficking community."

One third of the US population is clinically obese, a condition which increases the risk for chronic diseases like
type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), heart disease and cancers. Adipocyte dysfunction (AD) is cardinal feature of
metabolic dysregulation and increases the risk for developing insulin resistance (IR), DM, and hypertension.
Along with adipocyte hypertrophy, macrophage infiltration of white adipose tissue (WAT) is associated with the
pathophysiology of obesity, AD and IR, albeit the underlying molecular mechanisms are uncharacterized. We
were first to show the presence of P311 in WAT, brown adipose tissue (BAT) and beige adipose tissue. The
WAT of P311 knockout (KO) mice has fewer resident macrophages and decreased cellular dynamics,
including decreased autophagy and apoptosis. This is potentially leading to adipocyte hypertrophy that in turn
causes hyperglycemia due to age- and genetic ablation-mediated P311 expression leading to overworked and
exhausted adipocytes in P311 KOs or low P311 expressing adipocytes compared to wild types. As studies are
limited, resident macrophages could alter adipocyte function early in adipose tissue development, a novel
mechanism requiring exploration. We will also explore key adipocyte cellular processes of apoptosis and
autophagy/lipophagy, which may affect adipocyte turnover in the WAT of P311 KO mice, leading to adipocyte
hypertrophy and dysfunction, and thus metabolic deregulation.
The proposed project will test the central hypothesis that age- and genetic ablation-mediated P311 levels play
a key role in white, brown and beige adipocyte development, plasticity and function, as well as in metabolic
regulation. Further, we will investigate the role of P311 in cellular processes (i.e., WAT browning and BAT
whitening) and its effect on adipocyte function and glycemic control, as P311 KO mice are hyperglycemic. We
will also evaluate the ability of P311 to modulate adipose biology and metabolic regulation through PPAR and
UCP1 regulation; and myo1C binding to GLUT4. We will develop adipocyte-specific P311 KO conditional mice
using novel CRISPR technology to evaluate the adipocyte-specific P311 roles. The current project will thereby
establish P311 as a new player in adipocyte biology and metabolic regulation. Our experimental strategy will
incorporate transgenic animals using classic cell biology, molecular biology, biochemical, immunoassays and
imaging methods studies. Our findings will enhance the understanding of P311 mediated fat cell development
and function and fat mass expansion. Our ongoing studies indicate that P311 potentially regulates metabolism
through adipocyte dynamics, function and plasticity (a novel approach to targeting metabolic disorders through
browning of WAT); regulating resident and infiltrating macrophages; and controlling adipocyte cellular
processes. These studies are new and do not overlap with existing funding."

The long-term goal of this project is to increase the trustworthiness of health care providers and institutions and
decrease the rates of medical mistrust among homeless-experienced older adults, thereby, improving health
outcomes. The proposal seeks to renew 2AG041860, “Aging Among the Homeless: Social Isolation, Function
and Institutional Care” and continue the Health Outcomes in People Experiencing Homelessness in Older
Middle agE (HOPE HOME) study, which recruited and followed a cohort of 450 homeless adults age 50 or
older. Approximately half of all homeless adults are age 50 or older; this trend is expected to continue. HOPE
HOME participants have poor health, including physical health problems, geriatric conditions, and functional
impairments similar to housed individuals in their 70s and 80s. Black Americans, LGBTQ+ individuals, and
those with mental health problems and/or substance use disorders are overrepresented in the homeless
population, including in the HOPE HOME study sample. Individuals with these identities may experience
discrimination and stigma, which influence medical mistrust. Mistrust may be a barrier to health care utilization
and related to poor health outcomes in older homeless adults; little is known about this association.
We propose to recruit an additional 150 HOPE HOME participants to replace those who have died or been lost
to follow-up, and to follow the cohort for 54 months with nine semi-annual visits for structured interviews. We
will recruit a sub-sample of 30 participants for in-depth qualitative interviews and 20 of those for clinical
observation to understand the factors associated with medical mistrust and its dynamic nature. We will recruit
20 key informants who work in settings that serve homeless older adults for in-depth qualitative interviews.
Study visits for participants will take place at an administrative building belong to Lifelong Medical, a FQHC
which serves older homeless adults. Participant observations will take place at local clinics and health care
institutions. Trained interviewers, under the supervision of study investigators, will administer structured
interviews to assess key variables and study investigators with research personnel will conduct participant
observation of primary care visits. A Community Advisory Board, composed of community and policy leaders in
homelessness and study participants, will work with the study team to guide study development and translate
the findings into a toolkit, practice, and policy. Study findings will contribute to the development of clinical,
programmatic, and policy recommendations summarized in a toolkit aimed to increase trustworthiness of
health care institutions."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating, age-associated, and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disorder.
Although the prevalence of AD is increasing, there are no effective therapies that can prevent or delay AD
onset.
 Brain-derived Lipoproteins (BLps), transport lipids throughout the brain, and are an emerging target for
AD therapeutics. For example, the E4 isoform of the major BLp scaffold protein APOE can stabilize amyloid-
beta (Aβ), leading to plaque formation and increased AD risk. However, due to the suboptimal isolation of BLps
in earlier studies, and the use of unlipidated APOE4, important questions have been left unanswered. What
factors regulate BLp processing, and can they be targeted to treat AD?
 Microglia play a major role in BLp processing and AD pathophysiology. Recent studies have shown that
phagocytic microglia are defined by their elevated expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL); the rate-limiting
enzyme in lipoprotein hydrolysis and uptake. Notably, LPL-expressing microglia engulf Aβ to protect against
Aβ plaque formation. The notion that LPL is protective is consistent with epidemiological studies showing
reduced Aβ plaque formation and decreased AD prevalence in individuals harboring gain-of-function LPL
variants. Although LPL is a potential target for the treatment of AD, this has not been validated in vivo.
 My laboratory has substantial expertise in lipid metabolism, LPL biology, and microglia and is uniquely
positioned to investigate LPL as a therapeutic target for AD. We have previously shown that LPL regulates
microglial phagocytosis, lipoprotein uptake, and immune function, hence identifying LPL as an
immunometabolic gatekeeper in microglia (Bruce et al., 2018; Loving et al., 2021). Furthermore, our compelling
preliminary data has shown that increasing LPL activity can enhance microglial uptake of Aβ and BLps.
Therefore, we hypothesize that microglial-LPL helps to clear Aβ and excess BLps to protect against AD
development and that increasing LPL activity in vivo can ameliorate AD progression. To test this, in AIM
I, we will use microglial-specific knockdown mice (MiLPLKD) and AD susceptible mice (5xFAD) to empirically
determine whether pharmacological LPL activation can halt AD progression. We will also use state-of-the-art

dependent mechanisms governing lipoprotein processing by microglia and to determine whether enhancing

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating, age-associated, and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disorder.
Although the prevalence of AD is increasing, there are no effective therapies that can prevent or delay AD
onset.
 Brain-derived Lipoproteins (BLps), transport lipids throughout the brain, and are an emerging target for
AD therapeutics. For example, the E4 isoform of the major BLp scaffold protein APOE can stabilize amyloid-
beta (Aβ), leading to plaque formation and increased AD risk. However, due to the suboptimal isolation of BLps
in earlier studies, and the use of unlipidated APOE4, important questions have been left unanswered. What
factors regulate BLp processing, and can they be targeted to treat AD?
 Microglia play a major role in BLp processing and AD pathophysiology. Recent studies have shown that
phagocytic microglia are defined by their elevated expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL); the rate-limiting
enzyme in lipoprotein hydrolysis and uptake. Notably, LPL-expressing microglia engulf Aβ to protect against
Aβ plaque formation. The notion that LPL is protective is consistent with epidemiological studies showing
reduced Aβ plaque formation and decreased AD prevalence in individuals harboring gain-of-function LPL
variants. Although LPL is a potential target for the treatment of AD, this has not been validated in vivo.
 My laboratory has substantial expertise in lipid metabolism, LPL biology, and microglia and is uniquely
positioned to investigate LPL as a therapeutic target for AD. We have previously shown that LPL regulates
microglial phagocytosis, lipoprotein uptake, and immune function, hence identifying LPL as an
immunometabolic gatekeeper in microglia (Bruce et al., 2018; Loving et al., 2021). Furthermore, our compelling
preliminary data has shown that increasing LPL activity can enhance microglial uptake of Aβ and BLps.
Therefore, we hypothesize that microglial-LPL helps to clear Aβ and excess BLps to protect against AD
development and that increasing LPL activity in vivo can ameliorate AD progression. To test this, in AIM
I, we will use microglial-specific knockdown mice (MiLPLKD) and AD susceptible mice (5xFAD) to empirically
determine whether pharmacological LPL activation can halt AD progression. We will also use state-of-the-art
metabolic imaging and `omics approaches to identify LPL-dependent mechanisms controlling microglial
metabolism and function. In AIM II, we will use native BLps carefully isolated from human CSF to define LPL-
dependent mechanisms governing lipoprotein processing by microglia and to determine whether enhancing
LPL activity is a rational strategy to restore lipid handling in APOE4 carriers. The findings from this study will be
transformative to our understanding of lipoprotein handling in the brain and the mechanisms leading to AD
neuropathogenesis. Our study will not only determine LPL-dependent mechanisms regulating microglial
metabolism and function but will also ascertain whether novel LPL activators can improve microglial function to
ameliorate AD pathology, a new strategy with major clinical impact."

Evolution via natural selection results in organisms adapted to their environment, but also involves trade-offs.
Many complex diseases affecting humans today are historical artifacts of our past evolution. Thus, a better
understanding of the process of adaptation may provide new tools to combat complex disease. And yet there
are considerable gaps in our knowledge of the dynamics of adaptation at the level of genotype and phenotype,
in large part due to the challenges of inferring the effects of past selection on human populations. The long-term
goal of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular basis of adaptation using an innovative, sexually-reproducing
laboratory system of outcrossing yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Experimental evolution offers a powerful
method to test hypotheses about adaptation as investigators observe populations evolve in real time under
controlled conditions. With genome sequencing, genetic variation can be sampled from populations during the
process of adaptation; this technique is called “Evolve-and-Resequence”, or E&R. Recent E&R work with this
yeast laboratory system has advanced fundamental evolutionary questions, for example by providing strong
evidence that preexisting genetic variation drives adaptation, rather than beneficial new mutations. Also, it finds
that the stable long-term maintenance of genetic diversity is common, even when selection is strong. Building
upon these initial discoveries, additional questions are being tested, such as what evolutionary outcomes result
from complex selection environments involving fluctuating or otherwise dynamic selection pressures, and what
influence gene expression has on adaptive change, over a range of time scales. This proposal takes advantage
of MIRA’s flexible research goals, as it would support multiple yeast E&R projects. Each will further
understanding of general adaptative dynamics, and will also deliver specific insights into particular traits. A trait
of special interest to this proposal is late-life fertility. Senescence, or the decline in survival and fertility with
advancing age, is a good example of a complex disease facing humans as a result of evolutionary trade-offs.
Preliminary data in this application show that through selecting only the oldest cells to reproduce over many
generations, yeast populations evolve to live longer and remain fertile at later ages than control populations. This
provides an exciting potential to dissect the genetic basis underlying longevity and late-life fertility, and new
research horizons are expected to become attainable as a result. The proposed research is significant, because
it is expected to vertically advance and expand understanding of the natural genetic variation underlying healthy
versus disease-related phenotypes, and specifically for phenotypes related to late-life reproductive success.
Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to inform the development of approaches in personalized medicine,
and/or gene therapies, that will lead to a variety of improved health outcomes."
10845701,"Our Country’s biomedical workforce needs more professionals. In particular there is a grave need to promote diversity
within this population. Interventions, from elementary to college, to address this need aim to educate students about
opportunities in biomedicine. However, it’s important to note the educators of our future biomedical workforce are
often not included in these interventions. The lack of engagement of teachers results in a growing gap in knowledge
about the biomedical workforce pipeline and contemporary biomedical research topics which must be remedied.
Innovative interventions are needed to expand student exposure to biomedical careers as well as enhance teacher
professional development in biomedical research areas. Further, when teachers are provided the tools to apply data literacy
to their teaching practices, they are then empowered to maximally engage their students in these novel interventions. The
proposed SEPA program, “It’s Contagious! Promoting the Biomedical Workforce Pipeline through Infectious Diseases”,
will feature the current science issue of infectious diseases. Using data from infectious disease research and interactions
with biomedical researchers the Teachers as Researchers (TaR) program will (Aim 1), engage secondary teachers to create
and integrate Classroom To Career Connections (C2C2) activities and supplemental narratives into their classroom
instruction (Aim 2). The TaR program will provide data literacy professional development for teachers as they will collect
data from the C2C2 activities. TaR cohorts will participate in a Community of Practice (CoP) (Aim 3) where they will apply
data literacy skills to evaluate C2C2 activities assessing student knowledge of infectious diseases and apply data outcomes
to inform teaching practices. Within the CoP Teachers will engage in discourse with CoP colleagues as they evaluate student
data and present data outcomes. Participants will reflect upon how data outcomes from student activities inform decisions
regarding their own teaching practices galvanizing data literacy skills that teachers will apply throughout their career.
Through these aims, “It’s Contagious! Promoting the Biomedical Workforce Pipeline through Infectious Diseases”
will support teachers in their mission as they inspire the next generation of biomedical scientists."

Training Program (SDTP) was established under the leadership of Dr. Roberto Civitelli, with the purpose of
training the next generation of skeletal investigators, and it was renewed in 2015. This SDTP provides the
educational and mentoring infrastructure of the WU Musculoskeletal Research Center, a partnership between
the Departments of Medicine (Division of Bone and Mineral Diseases) and Orthopaedic Surgery, supported by
a NIAMS-funded P30 award, thus integrating the complementary aims of this T32 and the P30 into a unified
structure. The SDTP offers 3 pre- and 3 post-doctoral positions and has so far enrolled 27 trainees (12
graduate students and 15 post-doctoral fellows). Of these, 5 have progressed to faculty appointments, 5 to
permanent positions in industry; one has been awarded a K99/R00 grant; 5 have received an F-type award.
Together, they have published 104 articles directly linked to this program and received numerous awards and
recognitions. This SDTP offers research training in 5 thematic areas, reflecting the focus and common interests
of the participating faculty: 1) Musculoskeletal Biomechanics; 2) Skeletal Development and Regeneration; 3)
The Skeleton and Other Systems; 4) Skeletal Immunology; 5) Tumor-Skeleton Interactions. Mentors selected
for this SDTP are drawn from 9 academic Departments and Programs at WU. The program is based on 4 training
domains: 1) mentored research training; 2) curriculum coursework; 3) enrichment activities; 4) career
development. The training program builds on the graduate programs administered by the Division of Biology and
Biomedical Sciences and the Department of Biomedical Engineering and leverages the Institute for Translational
and Clinical Sciences and other institutional resources. Specific innovations proposed include,1) development
of non-academic research training opportunities; 2) expansion of training in rigor and reproducibility; 3) addition
of a mentor education plan; 4) enhanced participation of previous trainees and creation of an Alumni Network;
5) new efforts in increasing participation of URM to the program; 6) increased emphasis on career development

bases of skeletal disorders, and eventually improve the treatment of osteoporosis, inflammatory osteolysis,
osteoarthritis, bone metastasis, and other skeletal disorders that afflict a large proportion of the elderly population."
10845511,"NHGRI U24: ATLAS OF REGULATORY VARIANTS IN DISEASE (ARVID)
PROJECT SUMMARY
 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to risk of developing specific non-cancerous polygenic diseases,
including ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer’s dementia,
type 2 diabetes, and ischemic stroke. These disease-linked SNPs concentrate in regulatory DNA
active in cell types that may mediate disease risk by modulating genes (eGenes) whose expression
levels may be important in pathogenesis. These disease-linked expression SNPs (eSNPs)
commonly alter transcription factor (TF) DNA binding motifs, indicating they may affect regulatory
DNA activity by changing gene regulator binding. This U24 proposal aims to generate a genomic
resource, the Atlas of Regulatory Variants in Disease (ARVID), containing the following 3 broad
categories of information: 1) the individual disease-linked human eSNPs with differential gene
regulatory function in relevant cell types 2) the target genes (eGenes) that these eSNPs
dysregulate and 3) the gene regulators whose DNA association such disease eSNPs alter.
 First, we will identify the specific functionally altered eSNPs among those linked to index SNPs
identified by GWAS in the 5 widespread human diseases noted above using massively parallel
reporter assays (MPRA). A resulting subset of 300 top disease risk and non-risk eSNP pairs will
then be deeply characterized in isogenic cells generated by gene editing to identify directly and
indirectly dysregulated target genes. This effort will produce a Genomic Compendium of a) the
disease-linked eSNPs that quantitatively impact regulatory DNA function in disease-relevant cell
types and of b) the eGenes for the 300 top disease eSNPs.
 Second, we will identify the specific gene regulators whose DNA association is altered at the 300
disease risk eSNPs above, compared to matched non-risk alleles. To do this, we will use a live-cell
proteomics approach termed DNA Protein Interaction Detection (DAPID). Quantitative mass
spectrometry using isobaric tagging will be complemented by quantitative chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using isogenic, disease-relevant cells that differ only at the
single eSNP nucleotide of interest. This effort will produce a Proteomic Atlas of differential regulator
binding at 300 reference-disease eSNP pairs.
 This NHGRI U24 will generate a genomic resource defining the DNA variants, target genes, and
gene regulators involved in inherited risk for 5 common non-cancerous polygenic human diseases."
10845514,"Project Summary/Abstract
Despite advances in genetic testing for inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs), detection of a DNA variant of
unknown significance (VUS) can prevent a patient from receiving a genetic diagnosis. The long-term goal of the
proposed research is to address this problem using cell-based assays that can efficiently identify which DNA
variants are disease-causing mutations and which are benign polymorphisms, at a scale that would produce
medically-actionable information. IRDs are important causes of vision loss, and are increasingly treatable by
gene-specific therapies such as gene augmentation therapy. While an accurate genetic diagnosis is critical
before administering a gene-specific therapy, confident identification of the genetic cause for particular patient’s
IRD can be difficult, with about one third of patients failing to receive a genetic diagnosis altogether. Thus, there
is an unprecedented need to efficiently identify the genetic causality of IRDs in order to translate existing and
emerging sight-preserving or sight-restoring therapies to patients. To address this need, the goal of the proposed
research is to capitalize on this opportunity via a set of integrated Aims focused on the efficient identification of
pathogenic variants in important IRD genes. The proposed research seeks to shift the current research
paradigm-- analyzing small numbers of DNA variants in IRD genes as they are discovered-- to a paradigm
where large quantities of data are generated in advance about variants in medically-important IRD genes.
Therefore, the proposed research tests the hypothesis that empiric, cell-based assays can be used to efficiently
and accurately identify which DNA variants in humans are pathogenic and cause IRDs, and which are likely
benign polymorphisms. In Aim 1, we assemble and characterize a comprehensive collection of potentially
pathogenic amino acid changes in an important dominant IRD gene, rhodopsin. An expansion of this Aim tests
which of these mutations are amenable to chaperone therapy with small molecules. In Aim 2, these techniques
are modified to characterize a comprehensive collection of potentially pathogenic amino acid changes in an
important recessive IRD gene, RPE65. It is further hypothesized that comparing assay results to human
phenotype data will define proper numerical ranges which correspond to pathogenic results in humans. Viewed
together, these Aims provide a pathway for producing an openly-available resource that could instantly provide
higher-fidelity information about VUS in IRDs to medical geneticist, genetic counselors, and investigators of
IRDs. It takes advantage of a significant opportunity where investigation of the Aims can directly produce
medically-actionable information resulting in the delivery of therapies to otherwise untreatable patients."

The Yale Women's Reproductive Health Research (WRHR) Career Development Center was established 15
years ago. Its objective is to provide advanced training of Ob/Gyns in basic, translational and/or clinical research
in Women's Reproductive Health, under the guidance of skilled scientific Mentors, in order to produce the next
generation of physician-scientists and leaders in the field. It has been extremely successful. So far, the Yale
Program has mentored 10 Scholars, of which 8 have graduated, and 2 are currently in-training. All our original
graduated Scholars are Division Directors in Ob/Gyn Departments at major US academic institutions, and have
been successful in obtaining NIH research support. Our more recently graduated Scholars have become/are
becoming leaders in their respective fields and also include Division and Fellowship Directors. All hold faculty
positions in Ob/Gyn Departments at major US academic institutions and have obtained research funding. This
proposal is a continuation of this well-established, rigorous, step-wise research-training program. The Program
Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) and Research Director (RD) monitor the Scholars’ academic progress
toward independence. We identify prospective scholars from our residents and subspecialty fellows, as well as
by national networking; advertisements in professional journals; letters to Program Directors and Chairs; and
postings at national meetings. Our Advisory Committee chooses Scholars exhibiting exceptional promise and
commitment to a career in Women's Reproductive Health Research. The PD/PI, RD, and Advisory Committee
are directly involved in the training, evaluation and academic development of each Scholar, and monitor their
progress toward research independence. Mentors are experienced in career development and are outstanding
scientists in fields related to Women's Reproductive Health. Core training laboratories in Molecular and Cellular
Biology along with a didactic program are required for all Scholars, including instruction in the responsible
conduct of research. There are two Scholars in the Department at any given time, with each assigned laboratory
space with access to shared teaching and training cores. In order to pursue career development, at least 75%
of the Scholars' time is devoted to research, plus support for up to 5 years to underwrite costs while they obtain
preliminary data for grant applications. During this time, our goal is for Scholars to obtain competitive NIH and
other funding sufficient to suppport an independent academic career. Scholars enter the Department as Assistant
Professors, with appropriate office space and support staff. Clinical duties and responsibilities relate directly to
their research interests. The Yale WRHR program is extremely popular and competitive allowing us to rapidly fill
open positions with outstanding candidates. The overall impact and effectiveness of the program and its quality
are evidenced by the success of all of our scholars. The Yale WRHR Center aims to foster Scholars' development
into independent investigators. Yale seeks to retain, as faculty, Scholars who successfully complete this
individualized training program and who have made significant progress toward independent funding."
10845530,"53BP1 influences genome stability via two independent mechanisms: (i) a direct role in DNA double-strand break
(DSB) repair, (ii) enhancing the activity of p53 as a transcription factor. The role of 53BP1 in DSB repair has
been well described with a large body of literature. However, there is very limited understanding of how 53BP1
impacts p53 with contrasting reports on mechanism and function. Perturbing ‘normal’ mitosis caused a p53-
dependent cell cycle arrest which was dependent on 53BP1 and its known interactor USP28. The suggested
mechanism was that 53BP1/USP28 played a role in the stability and nuclear localization of p53. Another study
reported that 53BP1/USP28 accentuated the transactivation function of p53 in response to DNA damage/stress.
Loss of 53BP1/USP28 impaired the chromatin recruitment of p53 but did not impact p53 protein levels. We
recently identified TIRR (Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator), as a direct interactor and regulator of 53BP1
function in DSB repair. 53BP1 recruitment to DSBs by recognition of histone H4 dimethylated at lysine K20 is
inhibited by TIRR binding to the Tudor domain of 53BP1. Like p53, TIRR also binds 53BP1 independent of
chromatin and DSBs. We speculated that TIRR may regulate the interaction of p53 with 53BP1, and influence
53BP1-mediated activation of p53. Loss of TIRR indeed enhanced the interaction of 53BP1 and p53 resulting in
an aberrant increase in p53’s gene-transactivation function. TIRR specifically inhibited the complex formation
between the Tudor domain of 53BP1 and a dimethylated form of p53 that is poised for transcriptional activation
of its target genes. The impact of TIRR loss on p53 gene expression was partially rescued by depletion of 53BP1
or USP28. Therefore in Aim 1 we propose to investigate the interplay of TIRR with 53BP1/USP28 in regulating
p53 transactivation function. TIRR is a RNA binding protein and our prior structural studies revealed two non-
canonical RNA binding motifs in TIRR. We systematically identified TIRR bound transcripts and discovered that
TIRR directly binds transcripts of several p53-regulated genes. The binding occurs near the transcription start
sites (TSS) and the 3’UTR of these transcripts. Based on this data we hypothesize that TIRR may influence
transcriptional elongation and mRNA stability, providing a 53BP1-independent mechanism by which TIRR
regulates the p53 signaling axis. This hypothesis will be tested in Aim 2. Exploring the clinical relevance of TIRR
mediated inhibition of p53, we observed that amplification of the TIRR genomic locus in human carcinomas is
mutually exclusive from TP53 mutation/deletions and amplifications of the MDM2/4 loci suggesting that these
are distinct mechanisms of suppressing p53 function. We generated a TIRR-deficient mouse model to investigate
the idea that loss of TIRR will prevent the formation of p53-proficient tumors. Our preliminary results support this
idea as these animals in the context of p53 heterozygosity, resembling Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) patients,
have dramatically reduced tumorigenesis. In Aim 3 we will define the relevance of TIRR in cancer biology at the
organismal level."
10845621,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A key question in my research is: why does diversity in quantitative traits persist, despite
evidence of selection that should eliminate this diversity? Environmental variation can generate
genetic tradeoffs both among and within populations, helping to maintain this genetic diversity. I
study the genetic mechanisms and architecture of these tradeoffs in nature. My recent research
has focused on two central goals: 1) developing approaches for finding the genetic basis of local
adaptation and 2) empirical testing of hypotheses about local adaptation and G×E. I propose
research to study genetic mechanisms of adaptation to environment using a model system that
is convenient for ecological experimentation, Arabidopsis thaliana. This work will test
hypotheses about the genetic architecture of adaptation to changing environments through
space and time, about how gene flow influences genetic architecture, and about the role of gene
expression plasticity in adaptation to variable environments. In all projects, our ability to conduct
ecologically realistic but controlled common garden experiments will provide information on
genetic variation in environmental responses (G×E) that can be used to interpret observational
data from nature. We will first study the genetic mechanisms of adaptation to temporally
changing environments. We will study how different populations of have adapted to hundreds of
generations of environmental change by sequencing genomes of museum specimens. Second,
we will study local adaptation along montane environmental gradients with different levels of
isolation to test how gene flow influences the architecture of local adaptation. This project will
collect populations from different geographic contexts and conduct experiments to characterize
the genetic basis of local adaptation and expression plasticity. My proposed work will make
important strides in testing how tradeoffs along complex environmental gradients influence
genetic diversity across the genome."

This is a vastly revised competitive renewal of NIH T32 HL-07910 entitled: “Basic Science Studies on Gene
Therapy of Blood Diseases” which is in its 20th year of funding. The discipline of gene therapy has made clinical
advances, but is still an emerging clinical field that has not come close to yet realizing its potential. To continue
to advance the field in quality of vector transduction and engrafting vector-transduced hematopoietic stem,
progenitor and other carrier cells, we must train the next generation of dedicated pre-doctoral students and post-
doctoral/clinical fellows. Our aim is to continue to train this next generation of scientists in the clinically-relevant
medical area of gene transfer for effective modulation of normal and abnormal cell growth and for gene therapy
to correct blood diseases. We request 4 pre- and 5 post-doctoral slots as allotted in the last competitive renewal.
We have an outstanding group of 25 very productive, interactive, well-respected and NIH funded investigators
as mentors with their primary and/or secondary faculty appointments in 10 departments of the medical school.
These mentors have over their career trained a total of 241 pre-doctoral PhD and 412 post-doctoral students,
and have published more than 3,500 papers (2798 original refereed, and 709 reviews/book chapters), many with
their trainees. Since the competitive renewal of this program in 2014, we were able to train and/or were in the
process of training 10 pre and 10 post-doctoral students, who have published 72 papers [40 (Pre-Doc) and 32
(Post-Doc)]. The Program Director (PD) has trained 21 pre-doctoral and 57 postdoctoral/clinical fellows, has
published 795 papers, cited over 63,000 times with an H-Factor of 120, and been continuously funded by the
NIH since 1978. He is a recognized authority on hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, and regulation of
hematopoiesis. The Co-PD, is a well-recognized and well-funded productive investigator in the area of gene
transfer/therapy, and hematopoiesis during disease who has trained numerous students and fellows. The PD
and Co-PD have had their work translated for clinical benefit and have extensive administrative experience. They
have worked for many years in the area of gene transfer to enhance gene therapy. The majority of our trainees,
since initial funding of this grant in 1999, have gone on to careers in academia and other research intensive
areas of employment. Training of our pre- and post-doctoral students entails one-on-one interactions, committee
and group mentorship, lab meetings, a special seminar series, and journal club in the area of this training
program, didactic courses, ethical training, presentations at scientific meetings and expectations for them to
publish in scientific and medical journals, to present their work at national and international meetings and to
become productive independent investigators whose work will benefit healthcare in general and gene
transfer/gene therapy in specific. Trainees are rigorously picked for their motivation and past productivity.
Training efforts are enhanced by strong internal and external advisory board committees."

In 2020, an estimated 5.8 million Americans had Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of
dementia, and this number is expected to reach 13.8 million by 2050. Alzheimer’s Disease and related
dementias (ADRD) take an enormous toll on individuals affected, as well as their caregivers. Because disease-
modifying therapies have proved largely ineffective, a priority is placed on finding ways to prevent this
debilitating disease. This is particularly important for Black Americans who have a greater risk for poor
cognitive aging compared to non-Hispanic White Americans, whether measured as clinical dementia or lower
cognitive function in late life. Because neighborhood design factors can be modified at the population level
through policy and regulation, they are an attractive area for intervention. Green space is one neighborhood
design element that may be associated with cognitive function because exposure to it may reduce stress,
improve mood, promote physical activity, and provide opportunities for social engagement, all of which have
been associated with better cognitive health. Communities of color are more likely to live in neighborhoods with
lower green space than white communities and structural racism, through past discriminatory policies leading
to residential segregation, has been implicated in this inequitable distribution of green space. Recognition of
these inequities has led to recent efforts to increase the amount and quality of green space in historically
disadvantaged communities through park improvement projects, street tree plantings, and vacant lot
restoration. While these initiatives may have the intention of combatting decades of disinvestment rooted in
structural racism, they may, instead, end up reinforcing segregation by race and/or socioeconomic status
because of gentrification, a process by which under-resourced neighborhoods are developed and experience
in-migration of affluent newcomers. Therefore, it is unclear if green space improvements are harmful or
beneficial to communities of color, particularly in neighborhoods that are undergoing revitalization. In the
proposed work, we will (1) assess the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between changes in green
space and cognitive function, cognitive decline, and dementia over a 20-year period in the (a) overall
population and (b) by race/ethnicity; (2) estimate the association between structural racism (as measured by
historical redlining spatial patterns) and cognitive function, cognitive decline, and dementia; and determine if
this association is mediated by green space exposure; (3) determine if (a) the association between green
space and cognitive function, cognitive decline, and dementia is moderated by gentrification; and (b) there is
an independent association between gentrification and psychosocial stressors, mental health, and perceived
neighborhood characteristics; and (4) partner with a national network of local environmental justice-oriented
organizations to explore barriers and facilitators to green space improvements and mitigation for displacement
due to gentrification. This work has the potential to provide guidance to improve cognitive health equity."

A major approach in causal inference literature aimed at mitigating bias due to unmeasured confounding is the so-
called instrumental variable (IV) design which relies on identifying a variable which (i) influences the treatment process,
(ii) has no direct effect on the outcome other than through the treatment, and (iii) is independent of any unmeasured
confounder. IV methods are very well developed and widely used in social and health science, although validity of
IV inferences may not be reliable if any of required assumptions (i)-(iii) is violated. This proposal aims to develop
(a) new IV methods robust to violation of any of (i)-(iii); (b) New negative control methods that can be used to detect
and sometimes to nonparametrically account for unmeasured confounding bias; (c) New bracketing methods for partial
inference about causal effects in comparative interrupted time series studies. The proposed methods will be used to
address current scientific queries in three major substantive public health areas:(1) to understand the health effects of
air pollution; (2) to quantify the causal effects of modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders;
(3) To uncover the mechanism by which a randomized package of interventions produced a substantial reduction of
HIV incidence in a recent major cluster randomized trial of treatment as prevention in Botswana, Africa. Our proposal
will provide the best available analytical methods to date to resolve confounding concerns in these high impact public
health applications and more broadly in observational studies in the health sciences."

 Heart failure (HF) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are prevalent among older adults in the U.S.
Patients with HF are twice as likely to have MCI than people without HF. Cognitive impairment in HF is associated
with significant decline in one’s ability to take care of one’s self and higher 12-month mortality. A small number
of cognitive interventions have demonstrated preliminary efficacy in improving cognitive function in HF. However,
this work suffers from some major limitations: 1) lack of focus on patients who already have cognitive impairments
and at higher risk of dementia; 2) focus on single-component interventions; 3) lack of evaluation of
responsiveness variables including genetic biomarkers; and 4) lack of long-term follow-up. Dr. Miyeon Jung,
PhD, RN proposes to address this gap by conducting a randomized controlled pilot trial to estimate the
preliminary efficacy of a virtual reality-based cognitive restoration (Vita) combined with a computerized cognitive
training intervention (Com) relative to each intervention alone and standard of care among 172 older HF patients
with MCI. The Specific aims of the project are to estimate the effects of the Vita and Com interventions
individually and in combination to improve: 1) attention and memory (Aim 1); 2) HF self-care, instrumental
activities of daily living, and health-related quality of life (Aim 2); and 3) dementia free survival (Aim 3) over 1
year. In addition, she will explore moderating factors that may influence intervention efficacy (i.e., baseline
cognitive function, depressive symptoms, HF severity, and presence of apolipoprotein E ε4 and BDNF Met allele).
 Dr. Jung proposes career development/training activities to develop expertise in diagnosing MCI
from normal cognition and dementia during this K76 award. Her multidisciplinary mentoring team consists of
highly successful leaders in the fields of neurology and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (LG
Apostolova, MD, MSc, primary mentor and dementia expert), cardiovascular nursing and HF (SJ Pressler, PhD,
expert in cognition and health-related quality of life in HF; DK Moser, PhD, expert in HF self-care and aging),
cardiology with HF specialty (I Gradus-Pizlo, MD), biostatistics with expertise in clinical trials (S Gao, PhD), and
human-centered technology (RJ Holden, PhD). Dr. Jung will receive training via mentor-mentee interactions in
group and individual settings, engaging in didactic coursework, workshops, and professional meetings, and
conduct of the proposed research study. The planned training activities will support Dr. Jung to: 1) develop
expertise in diagnosing cognitive impairment; 2) test preliminary efficacy of Vita+Com intervention among older
adults with HF and MCI; 3) develop leadership skills to become a leader who runs multidisciplinary research
teams and mentors future generations of researchers; and 4) become a successful R01-funded independent
investigator. In summary, Dr. Jung will develop and test efficacious interventions to improve cognitive function
among older adults with HF and MCI. Efficacious cognitive interventions will ultimately contribute to retaining the
patients’ functional independence and promoting related quality of life."

Sepsis is a leading cause of death that kills more than 5 million people annually word-wide. Sepsis involves
immune dysfunction that is characterized by excessive inflammation that causes multiple organ dysfunction
syndrome (MODS). At the same time, immunosuppression and T cell dysfunction impair host immune
defenses, resulting in the unimpeded spread of bacterial infections. Despite intense research efforts in the
field, all previous attempts to improve outcome in sepsis have failed and no effective treatments are available.
These disappointing results clearly demonstrate the need for a better understanding of the underlying
mechanisms that cause immune dysfunction in sepsis.
The focus of this laboratory has been to determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms that cause immune
dysfunction in trauma, critical care, and sepsis patients. Our long-term goal is to identify novel pharmacological
strategies that can prevent excessive inflammation and the immunosuppression responsible for morbidity and
mortality in sepsis. We discovered novel signaling mechanisms that regulate neutrophils and T cells and that
represent promising therapeutic targets to restore immune homeostasis in sepsis patients. These novel
signaling mechanisms regulate cell functions by cellular ATP release and by autocrine feedback through
excitatory and inhibitory purinergic receptors that act in synergy with Ca2+ signaling and mitochondrial
metabolism to fine-tune the immune cell responses needed for host defense. We found that the subcellular
localization and differential activation of mitochondria and purinergic receptors are essential for proper
neutrophil and T cell functions. Interfering with these signaling processes impairs the ability of these cells to
detect and eliminate invading pathogens. We found that these novel cell signaling pathways are impaired in
sepsis patients because excessive systemic ATP that accumulates in the circulation of these patients
interferes with the autocrine purinergic signaling mechanisms that regulate immune cell functions. In addition,
we found that sepsis impairs the mitochondria that provide the ATP for these purinergic signaling mechanisms.
In the proposed MIRA project, we plan to continue our studies in order to define the molecular and cellular
mechanisms that lead to immune dysfunction in sepsis. NAD is a nucleotide that functions as a coenzyme for
many metabolic processes. We will examine whether and how declining NAD levels in sepsis contribute to
mitochondrial dysfunction, immune defects, and poor outcome in sepsis. We will study whether increased
expression of CD38 in sepsis is responsible for increased NAD consumption and whether NAD consumption
deprives sirtuins of the coenzyme they need to prevent mitochondrial damage and prevent immune cell
dysfunction. In addition, we will study how purinergic signaling contributes to the activation and trafficking of
mitochondria within T cells and neutrophils and how these regulatory mechanisms are impaired in sepsis.
Finally, we will explore how CD38, NAD, and sirtuins can be targeted with pharmacological interventions in
order to restore mitochondrial function, purinergic signaling, and immune homeostasis in sepsis patients.
The proposed work is innovative and possibly paradigm shifting because it focuses on the novel concept that
mitochondria are central regulators of immune cells and that mitochondrial dysfunction is the underlying
problem that impairs immune function in sepsis. We propose to exploit this knowledge with innovative
treatments that replenish mitochondrial health and purinergic signaling and thereby restore immune function
from within the cell. This approach is superior to previous strategies aimed at intercepting stimulatory immune
cell signals that failed because these strategies further disrupted immune homeostasis and the ability of the
host to fight infections."

Olfactory (i.e., smell) disorders are incredibly impactful. Gas leaks and spoiled food are undetectable dangers.
Eating habits and the pleasure from food are compromised as meals become unpalatable. Affected individuals
can feel disconnected from other people and the world, contributing to an increased incidence of depression.
Changes in olfactory function may also be early indicators of other serious health problems such as
rhinosinusitis, skull base tumors, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, viral infection, or neurodegenerative diseases.
Routine testing of olfactory function can facilitate the early detection of smell disorders and comorbidities.
Research studies and clinical assessments of the human sense of smell typically operate under the
assumption that – barring insult from injury or disease – olfactory function is largely invariant on the time scale
of hours, days, and even months. However, this common assumption is demonstratively false. For example,
smell function varies on short timeframes like circadian cycles, and long timeframes like normal aging. Thus,
clinicians and researchers need a better understanding of normal variation in olfactory ability if they are to
accurately differentiate pathological dysfunction from normal fluctuations in function. Our proposed study will
document typical olfactory fluctuations in healthy people, in people experiencing natural physiological changes
or in those with smell disorders. In Aim 1, we will determine how olfactory detection thresholds (OdorDTs)
fluctuate on a daily, monthly and yearly basis in a large age-, sex- and race-diverse cohort of healthy adults. In
Aim 2, we will measure daily and weekly Odor DT changes accompanying either the menstrual cycle or
pregnancy. Aim 3 will focus on determining daily, monthly and yearly fluctuations in OdorDT in people with
quantitative smell disorders (i.e., anosmia or hyposmia) associated with previous upper respiratory viral
infections or with Parkinson's disease. Collectively, these studies will provide the first intensive longitudinal
assessment of olfactory function in healthy people and those with olfactory disorders. Further, they will result in
an invaluable open resource for clinicians and researchers who are assessing olfactory function in different
contexts."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and pain are major public health problems affecting millions of people in the United
States. More than 14 million Americans met the diagnostic criteria for AUD in 2019, and 50 million people in
the United States were estimated to have a chronic pain condition. These public health crises are related, as
people experiencing pain often report using alcohol to manage pain symptoms, and people with chronic pain
are at an elevated risk for developing AUD. Drinking alcohol to alleviate pain is a maladaptive strategy and
may lead to withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia, peripheral neuropathy, and AUD. While alcohol confers
analgesic effects in a dose-dependent manner, genetic differences mean that not every person experiences
this analgesia to the same degree. Previous research has revealed moderate-to-strong heritability (h2=0.42) for
ethanol-induced analgesia in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice, but the genes underlying this relationship are still
poorly characterized. Studies in rodent models have revealed evidence that opioid receptor systems, GIRK2
potassium channels, and GABAergic signaling pathways all have roles in ethanol analgesia, but no whole-
genome interrogations have been conducted. This project aims to identify candidate genes modulating alcohol-
induced analgesia using complementary genetic, behavioral and transcriptomic experiments in genetically
informative BXD mouse populations. By mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) for both basal and post-ethanol
hot plate latency with BXD strains, we will identify genomic loci linked with variation in ethanol-induced
analgesia. As an additional genome-wide approach, prefrontal cortex and periaqueductal gray samples from
high- and low-ethanol analgesia BXD strains will be studied by RNA-seq. We will perform weighted gene co-
expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify differentially expressed genes in these two analgesia
groups. By combining evidence from behavioral, statistical, and molecular methodologies, we will select the
strongest ethanol analgesia candidate gene for experimental verification using either overexpression or
knockout mouse models. This proposal comprises an investigative progression from identifying candidate
genes by QTL mapping, to elucidating gene expression patterns in critical brain regions, to validating ethanol
analgesia candidate genes. It represents an outstanding training opportunity for the candidate to design and
perform a suite of systems genetics and animal behavioral experiments and contribute to the scientific
understanding of substance-induced analgesia."

In this application, we seek to design, fabricate, and test implantable, packaged accelerometers that sense
incoming sound by transducing the motion of the middle ear (ME) bones (ossicles). We will test the
performance of these devices using benchtop calibration and quantification tests as well as using acoustic
stimulation of accelerometers implanted in cadaveric temporal bone preparations. We seek to create a device
that meets the stringent geometric, acoustic, weight, and power requirements for prostheses by using a multi-
resonant (multi-band) piezoelectric-micro-electro-mechanical systems (piezo-MEMS) sensor co-designed with
an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) with addressable filtering and amplifying circuitry. A novel flip-
chip packaging strategy is proposed which can deliver a 5-milligram piezo-MEMS-ASIC packaged device by
eliminating the need for printed circuit board mounting. State-of-the-art thin piezoelectric film materials and
deposition will be explored to further reduce the device size and improve performance. Separate, component-
level piezo-MEMS die and ASIC testing in combination with system-level testing in a benchtop setting will
enable characterization of the complete system. Tested sensor systems will be implanted in male and female
cadaveric temporal bone samples, and the acoustic sensitivity and noise floor characterized. We will consider
locations along the ossicular chain to reduce device impact on the ME mechanics, ease surgical implantation
(minimize invasiveness), and maximize sensitivity (as the accelerometer is sensitive to both translation and
rotation). The objective of this present application is to develop implantable sensors, because accomplishing
this objective is a necessary step in achieving our long-term goal of a totally implantable auditory prosthesis
(e.g., hearing aids and cochlear implants with all components housed invisibly). This line of research aims to
provide new implantable options to treat hearing loss, thereby increasing the number of auditory prosthesis
users by enhancing the usability, safety, cosmetic appeal, and performance of the device and improving
patient quality of life."

 CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD) is an X-linked genetic disorder caused by mutations in the cdkl5
(cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5) gene. Patients with CDD exhibit many features common to Autism Spectrum
Disorder, but also frequently suffer from cortical visual impairment. Specifically, patients with CDD display deficits
in visually-evoked potentials, an indirect measure of visually evoked thalamocortical input. Emerging evidence
suggests that loss of CDKL5 is also associated with neuronal hyperexcitability. Together, this suggests that loss
of CDKL5 may shift the balance between thalamocortical and intracortical processing. Mice lacking CDKL5
recapitulate many aspects of human CDD patients, including visual impairment, and also exhibit changes in
arousal. Work from our lab and others has demonstrated that arousal states reflect distinct underlying
physiological processes that influence spontaneous and sensory-evoked neural activity. However, the relative
impact of behavioral state dysregulation on thalamocortical dynamics and the contribution of a shift from
feedforward inputs to intracortical network control on visual processing remains unknown. Leveraging a recently
developed technique from our lab, we can simultaneously monitor spontaneous and visually-evoked thalamic
axon activity in the primary visual cortex and cortical activity across the dorsal neocortex in the awake, behaving
mouse. Using this approach, we have begun to characterize the functional consequences of CDKL5 deficiency
on state-dependent thalamocortical dynamics and visual processing. Our preliminary data demonstrates that
CDKL5 deficient mice display altered arousal states and cortical activity in a sex-dependent manner, along with
increased intracortical functional connectivity. Initial experiments suggest that CDKL5 deficient mice also exhibit
reduced visual response magnitudes in in primary visual cortex. We will therefore test the following hypotheses:
1) dysregulation of behavioral state in CDKL5 deficiency also disrupts thalamocortical network activity; 2) loss of
CDKL5 results in an increase in intracortical connectivity and a decrease in thalamocortical connectivity; 3)
CDKL5 deficiency leads to reduced thalamocortical visual sensitivity; and 4) CDKL5 deficiency decreases
feedforward transformation of sensory information. Together, our results will provide unprecedented insight into
the functional consequences of CDKL5 deficiency for state-dependent thalamocortical networks and visual
processing in a mouse model of CDD."

The National Library of Medicine ﬁrst funded the Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Research Training
(BIRT) program at Harvard Medical School (HMS) in 1992. The program continues to be a driving force in the
education of future leaders in the ﬁeld of computationally-enabled biomedicine. As data-driven research
increasingly enables critical innovation across the whole spectrum of healthcare, we need to train individuals
from a wide range of disciplines to participate in this process. Through rigorous scientiﬁc training, the
proposed program will prepare these individuals to integrate, interpret, and act on large-scale,
high-throughput, and complex data resulting from biomedical research and the practice of medicine.
The Department of Biomedical Informatics at HMS will be the administrative and intellectual home for the
proposed program. Faculty in the department have expertise in artiﬁcial intelligence, biomedical discovery
infrastructure including computational statistics and data visualization, clinical decision support,
computational omics, evolutionary genetics, integration of genotypes, phenotypes and environmental
exposures, learning health systems, microbial genomics, and taxonomies of disease. Additionally, other
Harvard faculty, members of the Broad Institute, and faculty based at aﬃliated teaching hospitals such
Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston Children’s Hospital, Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center, and Dana-Farber Cancer Center will participate in the training of the fellows.
Furthermore, the program will continue to coordinate its training eﬀorts with other data science programs at
Harvard and the Harvard Data Science Initiative.
The proposed program will focus on areas of informatics with direct health-related application domains:
translational bioinformatics, healthcare/clinical informatics, clinical research informatics, and public health
informatics. Combining the broad expertise and deep knowledge of informatics in our research laboratories
with the clinical data generated in the daily practice of medicine at the aﬃliated institutions will provide an
exceptional training environment.
The program will be open to trainees at the predoctoral and postdoctoral level who will enroll in academically
rigorous degree-granting programs. Predoctoral fellows will enroll in a PhD program, and postdoctoral fellows
will enroll in a Master’s program. Through these programs, the academic progress of the trainees will be
assessed regularly. In addition, trainees will conduct full-time research with internationally recognized faculty
on high-proﬁle grants and research projects. We will also oﬀer these research opportunities to short-term
trainees."
10846762,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Humans are frequently exposed to hazardous chemicals in the environment, which can damage DNA and
lead to cancer. However, over the past 30 years, the measurements of DNA adducts have been largely carried
out by monitoring a single or up to several DNA adducts, and the data have provided limited information about
causative agents of cancer. There is a crucial unmet need to establish a robust technology to screen for a broad
range of DNA adducts, some of which can be linked to mutations in cancer driver genes. The goal of our applica-
tion is to advance our mass spectrometry (MS) adductomics methods to screen for an array of DNA adducts
formed with hazardous chemicals in a single assay and develop algorithms for automated analysis. We will em-
ploy high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry (HRAMS) to detect DNA adducts by extracting the charac-
teristic spectral features of DNA adducts as they undergo fragmentation by the multistage (MSn) scanning. These
MSn scanning approaches can detect DNA adducts of diverse structures in human tissues over a wide range of
exposures. In this proposal, we will optimize our MS technology in rodents, under controlled exposures to an
array of chemicals thought to contribute to renal cancer, and we will create a mass spectral database and develop
software and informatics tools for comprehensive characterization of DNA adducts of the genome.
 In Aim 1, DNA adduct profiles will be generated in the kidney of rodents, following exposures to toxicants
found in tobacco, the environment, diet, from pro-oxidants, and electrophiles produced endogenously. Panels
of DNA adduct profiles resulting from these exposures will be characterized by untargeted data-dependent (DDA)
and data-independent acquisition (DIA), employing nanoflow liquid chromatography and multistage MSn
scanning with the Orbitrap MS. In Aim 2, a DNA adduct database will be constructed, and bioinformatics tools
will be created for the unbiased and automated detection of DNA adducts by extraction of the mass spectral
features of DNA adducts. The bioinformatics tools will identify patterns of adducts formed with different classes
of renal toxicants and conduct systematic comparison and identification of DNA adducts based on different types
of exposures and the mechanism of DNA damage. The DIA and DDA scanning methods, the DNA adduct
database, and bioinformatics technologies will serve as templates to examine for different classes of DNA
adducts in humans. In Aim 3, we will test our technologies to screen biopsies of renal cancer patients and explore
tobacco exposure, one of the few recognized risk factors for this cancer.
 The proposed technology for molecular analysis of DNA adducts is amenable to other target organs and cell
types and can help identify chemical agents and lifestyle factors that induce DNA damage and cancer risk.
Identification of DNA-damaging agents can lead to strategies to mitigate or prevent exposures to hazardous
chemicals with a dramatic impact on public health."
10846767,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Since this training program was first funded 34y ago, the specific problems that confront maternal and child
nutrition (MCN) have not gone away, but rather crucial challenges continue to exist and new ones have
emerged. As a result, there remains a compelling need to understand not only how to prevent nutritional
problems in women of childbearing age and young children but also how to mitigate the effects of these
problems on the later health of both women and their children. The proposed program is significant because,
in the short term, it will fill a major gap in training in MCN and, in the long term, individuals trained by this
program should fill a major gap in producing and interpreting integrative research on MCN. We propose
to train 4 (3 predoctoral and 1 postdoctoral) trainees by leveraging the resources of the renowned graduate
program in the Division of Nutritional Sciences at Cornell University, one of the largest academic units devoted
to human nutrition in the country. The proposed training program will be led by a multi-PD group composed of
four faculty members in the Division of Nutritional Sciences at Cornell University: Drs K.M. Rasmussen, L.
Bellows, J. Finkelstein, and J. Hoddinott. Program oversight will be provided by an External Advisory
Committee. Trainees will be mentored by a total of 14 trainers, who have active research programs as well as
an exemplary training record. The co-trainers have differing yet complementary skills in a wide range of
disciplines related to MCN as well as a long history of collaboration with one another in both training and
research. Trainees will complete a core curriculum consisting of 3 graduate-level courses: Topics in Maternal
and Child Nutrition, Grant Writing, and Translational Research and Evidence-based Policy and Practice in
Nutrition. These courses will be supplemented by the highly valued weekly meeting of the MCN Research
Forum as well as training in the responsible conduct of research and rigor and reproducibility in research. Use
of an Individual Development Plan along with our innovative Annual Collaborative Project will further
enhance the trainees’ career and leadership development as well as their resilience in the face of a
changing environment for research. Excellent facilities are available in the Division for the proposed program,
including well-equipped laboratories, animal facilities, an outpatient metabolic unit, a clinical chemistry
laboratory, and extensive support for statistical computing. Trainees will also have access to shared research
facilities throughout the campus and academic centers and institutes that focus on subjects that range from
vertebrate genomics to food and nutrition policy. As a result of the proposed program,pre- and postdoctoral
trainees will be able to identify the most important problems in MCN, address them with their research, and
effectively translate the results of their research into novel policies and appropriate actions."
10846770,"T cells are fundamental components of the adaptive immune system, and following exposure to a pathogen,
diverse populations of memory T cells persist to provide enhanced protection against re-exposure. While
the importance of circulating memory T cells has been appreciated for many years, it is only over the last
decade that it has become clear that subsets of memory T cells reside throughout peripheral tissues (known
as tissue-resident memory, or T RM) and provide potent, front-line protective immunity. The identification
of T RM has resulted in a paradigm shift in the way we need to monitor, target and promote T cell immunity
in vaccines, diseases and immunotherapies. However, our understanding of the ontogeny, maintenance, and
organization of these cells - their ecology - is lacking, even at a very basic level. For instance, humans retain
T-cell immunity to pathogens for years or decades, but it is unclear whether this memory persists as long-lived
cells or more dynamically, sustained by self-renewal and/or supplemented by newly generated cells. There
are many other open questions; for example, what factors govern the development and maintenance of T RM
and how might we manipulate them to boost their numbers? What underlies heterogeneity in their capacity
to persist? Do T RM compete with each other, either intra- or inter-clonally? What role does their spatial
arrangement play in any competitive dynamics? What are the rules of replacement within T RM niches?
In this proposal we will take a multidisciplinary approach to addressing these questions by integrating mathematical
and experimental tools in both mouse and human settings. Specifically: (i) We will use a mouse
model of influenza infection and quantitative imaging to build a set of validated models of the developmental
and homeostatic dynamics of T RM· By combining information regarding the time-varying spatial distribution
of T RM in the lung, and tracking the responses of pre-existing and newly generated T RM during and
after repeat infections, we will refine these models to include competition and spatial niches, and to understand
how interaction between T RM influences the rules of replacement within tissues and the durability of T
cell memory. (ii) We will use a powerful cell fate-mapping system to model the ontogeny and homeostasis of
T RM that are naturally and constitutively produced in multiple tissues across the mouse lifetime, and compare
their dynamics to those produced in overt infections. (iii) We will combine a unique human tissue resource
at Columbia with a novel application of 14C dating of DNA, a dedicated modeling framework, and quantitative
image analysis. This approach will define the contributions of antigen-driven influx and self-renewal to
T RM homeostasis, and identify heterogeneity in T RM dynamics, across tissues and ages.
In summary, this project will deliver a suite of quantitative tools for defining the life-histories of tissue-specific
memory T cells, in both mice and humans, across space and time."

Homeostatic plasticity (HP) encompasses a suite of compensatory physiological processes that stabilize neural
function. It is widely hypothesized that homeostatic plasticity will be linked to the cause and/or severity of
neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and intellectual disability. Yet, there remains limited molecular,
mechanistic information to directly connect homeostatic plasticity to neurological and neurodevelopmental
disorders. We recently demonstrated that the homeostatic regulation of presynaptic neurotransmitter release is
expressed in adult mammalian brain. We present new data demonstrating that presynaptic homeostatic
plasticity is blocked in a novel mouse model of severe intellectual disability, termed Jordan’s syndrome in
human. We will build upon new genetic and biochemical evidence and establish a mechanistic framework to
directly associate homeostatic plasticity with the genetic underpinnings of Jordan’s syndrome. These data
greatly expand our mechanistic and phenotypic understanding of Jordan’s syndrome and open the door to
future therapeutic approaches to ameliorate the pathophysiological severity of Jordan’s syndrome. Ultimately,
this research has broad implications for the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders based upon the
rational manipulation of homeostatic signaling."

10856614,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aneurysms, which are defined as a 50% increase in the diameter of a blood vessel, are an important cause of
death worldwide. Aortic aneurysms (AAs) are the most common type and they are divided into two groups:
thoracic (TAAs) and abdominal (AAAs). All aneurysms share similar histopathologic features of elastic fiber
fragmentation, disorganization and loss of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and accumulation of collagen and
proteoglycans, however, TAAs and AAAs differ in their pathogenesis. While TAAs have a strong genetic
predilection, AAAs are considered of atherothrombotic origin. Regardless of type, there is currently no directed
medical therapy for AAs, which progressively enlarge over time, increasing the risk of vessel rupture and fatal
hemorrhage. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of AAs to devise targeted
therapeutic strategies. A single gene mutation is identified in nearly 20% of individuals with TAAs and the genes
identified to date largely belong to three functional groups: 1) extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, 2)
transforming growth factor b signaling and 3) SMC contractility, which underscores the importance of the interplay
between the cell, signaling and the ECM in the pathogenesis of AAs. SMCs have been the focus of investigation
in AA pathogenesis, however it is increasingly recognized that endothelial cells (ECs) play a role through
endothelial dysfunction. We and others identified mutations in lysyl oxidase (LOX), a gene that encodes an
enzyme important for collagen and elastin crosslinking, as a cause of inherited TAAs in humans. Mice
homozygous for a Lox mutation identified in humans die perinatally of aneurysm rupture similar to mice lacking
LOX, therefore it is challenging to study AA pathogenesis and progression using these models. Our collaborator,
Dr. Philip Trackman at the Forsyth Institute, generated a conditional Lox mouse model, which when bred to mice
carrying Cre recombinase in certain cell types will lead to deletion or loss of LOX from that cell type. Dr. Trackman
generously shared this mouse model with us and we have bred to mice expressing Cre recombinase in ECs,
SMCs as well as specific SMCs of the ascending aorta, which are derived from two developmental origins. Our
preliminary data show increased proliferation markers in the ascending aorta where aneurysms are present. This
observation led us to hypothesize that loss of LOX leads to a phenotypic change in the cell from a differentiated
phenotype to a proliferative phenotype contributing to aneurysmal disease. This hypothesis will be explored in
this application. Results generated from the proposed studies will not only further our understanding of the role
LOX plays in arterial development and maintenance, but they will also help identify new pathways that may be
leveraged to develop targeted therapeutic strategies for aneurysmal disease."

 The long-term goal of this research is to improve self-efficacy, activity performance, and health in
individuals with stroke. Current stroke rehabilitation research and practice must be addressed to shift the focus
of the field from an over-emphasis on impairment reduction to management of stroke as a chronic disease.
The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that a clinically feasible, self-management-based intervention, the
Improving Participation after Stroke Self-Management Rehabilitation (IPASS-R) program, will produce a
significant improvement on measures of self-efficacy, activity performance, quality of life, and community
engagement outcomes as compared to a general health-focused self-management program, the Chronic
Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP). All assessment and intervention procedures will be conducted
virtually via videoconferencing. The specific aims of this project in the subacute stroke population are to: (1)
evaluate the efficacy of IPASS-R to improve self-efficacy within home, community, and work activity
performance; (2) evaluate the efficacy of IPASS-R to improve activity performance and quality of life; and (3)
explore the effect of IPASS-R on objective measures of in-home activity patterns and community engagement.
Participants with subacute stroke living in the community will be recruited through local hospitals at two sites (n
= 100). Those individuals who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to either an IPASS-R group or to a
CDSMP group. Both groups will receive six, 90-minute group sessions of self-management education.
Treatment outcomes will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and at six-months post-intervention.
Treatment efficacy outcomes will be analyzed with an intent-to-treat model with an analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA). Potential covariates will include age, stroke severity, degree of cognitive impairment, and degree
of motor impairment. Independent samples t-test and chi-square test will be used to ensure successful
randomization and balance between groups. Group differences at baseline that are statistically significant will
also be considered as covariates in the analysis. Post-hoc tests will be employed as appropriate. Significance
levels, effect sizes, and confidence intervals will be reported. Completion of this study is likely to result in an
efficacious, clinically feasible intervention to improve self-efficacy, activity performance, and participation in
individuals with stroke that can be feasibly implemented into current systems of care. The proposed study and
anticipated outcomes are consistent with the research priorities of the National Center for Medical
Rehabilitation Research (NCMRR), which include which include rehabilitation interventions focused on chronic
symptom management with real-world, participatory outcomes and objective markers of functional progress."
10855827,"Project Summary/Abstract
Lipid signaling is crucial for regulating organismal physiology and metabolic expenditure, and disturbances in
lipid homeostasis can deleteriously impact health. Cells tightly control the absorption, synthesis, and breakdown
of lipids to accommodate energetic demands and ensure energetic reserves later in life. We recently reported a
mechanism by which cells sense metabolic demand resulting from lipid depletion and respond by increasing
expression of genes involved in membrane trafficking as well as nutrient absorption and catabolism. This is
accomplished by the release of the starvation-responsive nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-49, from endocytic
vesicles and its subsequent nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation. Yet the mechanisms and
participating co-factors facilitating NHR-49 activation and attenuation remain unclear and are critical for
our fundamental understanding of lipid sensing and metabolism. Our examination has uncovered a
mechanism in which loss of antagonistic ligand binding releases NHR-49 from endocytic vesicles. Next, NHR-
49 sequentially engages a series of cofactor, which through direct interactions and post-translational
modifications, facilitate its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, transcriptional activation, and proteolytic degradation.
Through the proposed five-year research period, we aim to understand how cells activation and attenuation this
lipid surveillance response by defining the molecular details underlying the lifecycle of NHR-49 including its
nuclear import, intranuclear retention, and transcriptional regulation followed by its phosphorylation, nuclear
export and degradation. Our preliminary data has identified a series of co-factors including karopherins involved
in its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, nuclear pore complexes involved in its nuclear retention and transcriptional
activation, kinases involved in its nuclear export, and a ubiquitin ligase involved in its proteasomal degradation.
Through a more detailed description of NHR-49 co-factor interactions and their associated post-translational
modifications, we can gain a better understanding of intracellular lipid sensing and metabolic homeostasis."

 Substance use is associated with increased risk of, progression to, and negative outcomes from chronic
disease. Although associations between substance use and chronic disease are well documented, specific
mechanisms underlying these associations are poorly understood and underappreciated. There is a pressing
need for innovative, prospectively-designed, longitudinal studies that can clarify how biopsychosocial variables
contribute to linkages between substance use and chronic disease. However, coordinating and obtaining the
scientific expertise, clinical acumen, equipment, and other resources needed for these studies can be difficult
and time consuming, particularly for early-career scientists. Providing these resources through a research core
can enhance investigator productivity and promote scientific rigor and reproducibility. Thus, the overall aim of
the CADRE’s Clinical Laboratory Core (CLC) is to support research led by CADRE investigators, other
investigators at Brown University, and investigators from other IDeA-state institutions who are conducting
research on substance use and chronic disease, by identifying and providing the scientific expertise, clinical
acumen, technical capability, and other resources necessary to meet the needs of their projects. These
resources build on and complement, but do not overlap, resources currently available at Brown. Specific Aim 1
of the CLC is to provide the resources necessary for conducting both in-person and remote human subjects
research on substance use and chronic disease. Specific Aim 2 is to create a business plan that expands the
user base of the CLC, utilizes a fee-for-service model of cost recovery, and enables the CLC to be self-
sustaining when COBRE funding ends. Specific Aim 3, an exploratory aim, is to continue to build a center-wide
database of transdiagnostic risk factors associated with the development and progression of SUDs and chronic
disease. The successful achievement of these aims will be a thematically- and technically-linked center that
supports the initial and future projects, enhances the competitiveness of the project leaders for independent
external funding, becomes a national leader in understanding biobehavioral mechanisms linking SUDs and
chronic disease, and serves as a resource for training and research within Brown, regionally, and nationally."

induced mutagenesis (2), and to cell cycle checkpoint activation (3). Our primary approaches combine
biochemical and biophysical analysis with genetic analysis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to gain
insight in each of these three broadly defined pathways and their interconnectivity. Our studies are
augmented with structural studies of the complex machineries that function in these processes. Proposed
DNA replication studies are based on a strong record of progress in defining mechanisms of lagging strand
DNA replication and Okazaki fragment maturation. Since Okazaki fragments represent by far the most
frequent DNA discontinuities in all cells, it is imperative to understand the different layers of regulation of
this process. Okazaki fragment maturation has primarily been studied in well-defined biochemical systems,
in isolation from other events that occur at the replication fork. We propose to expand our studies within the
context of a complete replication fork, which has been assembled at a yeast replication origin. Our
mutagenesis studies will center on the main actors, DNA polymerase z and Rev1. On the one hand, Rev1
promotes DNA lesion bypass by Pol z; on the other hand, it limits the extent of mutagenesis by inhibiting Pol
z-dependent DNA synthesis outside the narrow environment of the lesion. We will unravel the mechanism
that underlies this dual regulatory function of Rev1. The primary focus of our checkpoint studies is on the
two sensor protein kinases Mec1 and Tel1, the orthologs of human ATR and ATM, respectively.
Biochemical and genetic studies will be combined with cryo-EM studies to understand how the basal
activities of these unique protein kinases are activated. Furthermore, the advantage of having an efficient
DNA replication system available will allow us to begin addressing the coupling between replication arrest
and the downstream response pathways. Finally, in keeping with the MIRA principle, we will pursue other
fascinating questions in DNA metabolism that may, and undoubtedly will arise during our investigations."

 There is currently no known prevention, cure, or effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementia (ADRD) even as the number of people with ADRD is projected to increase dramatically as the
population ages. Policymakers, advocates, clinicians, patients, and caregivers have asked the research
community to improve our understanding of the cultural dynamics surrounding ADRD in order to develop
effective, evidence-based, and sustainable approaches for caring for ADRD-impacted populations. The
premise of this application is that there is a need for increased research capacity to advance our understanding
of culture, aging, and ADRD and help address the challenge presented by the increasing prevalence of
Alzheimer’s and related dementias.
 This application for an Academic Leadership Award is entitled Leadership to Enhance Aging Research and
iNnovation in Medical Culture (LEARN-MC). It aims to enhance the capacity of the University of California San
Francisco (UCSF) to conduct research on aging and medical culture in the context of ADRD. LEARN-MC will
be based in the UCSF Medical Cultures Lab (MCL). It reflects the PI’s training in sociology of culture and
ethnography, his research track record on medical culture, and his experience developing educational and
training programs. LEARN-MC will build on and expand on existing relationships with multiple communities
conducting ADRD research at UCSF including the Departments of Neurology and Surgery, Divisions of
Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine, and the Global Brain Health Institute. LEARN-MC has three specific aims.
Aim 1: Create and maintain a resource library that synthesizes scholarship on medical culture, aging, and
ADRD from anthropology, geriatrics, gerontology, sociology, and related fields.
Aim 2: Develop courses on medical culture, ADRD, and aging to be taught in coordination with existing UCSF
teaching and training programs to learners at diverse career stages.
Aim 3: Establish the Medical Cultures Lab (MCL) as a center of excellence for research on medical culture,
aging, and ADRD. Expand MCL’s role as a mentorship hub for aging and ADRD research at UCSF. Use public
events and social media to establish MCL as a thought leader among policymakers, healthcare professionals,
and the lay public."

The goal of this project is to develop innovative physicians and PhD scientists trained in the latest methods of
laboratory, translational and clinical research and fully prepared to pursue independent research careers
investigating critical issues in Allergy and Immunology (A/I). For over 40 years this program has produced leaders
in the field of A/I. This application maintains the training collaboration established between the complementary
A/I training programs at Duke University and The University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC). The
combined strength of their A/I programs and their respective Universities create an ideal venue for training
the next generation of A/I investigators. This proposal continues a highly innovative program for both
physicians and PhD trained scientists in translational research in immune- based diseases. These goals
will be accomplished through 1) formal courses in clinical research design, 2) rigorous training in basic
immunology and 3) a structured mentorship program. Our research emphasis areas are designed to
address these future needs in the field: 1) Human Immune Response to Pathogens, 2) Immunobiology
of Food Allergy and 3) Pathobiology of Asthma, Respiratory and Allergic Disease. Mentors were selected from
highly integrated and focused programs currently in place at Duke and UNC who demonstrated research
productivity. Additionally, in this cycle we will bring an increased focus to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion as well
as the mentor development of junior faculty who will become future established mentors. This application
requests support for five trainees each year. Fulfillment of the program's objective would directly or indirectly
serve to meet two urgent medical needs: 1) the need for more full-time researchers and teachers of allergy and
clinical immunology in medical schools throughout the country and 2) the need for more physicians trained
in the specific care of patients with allergic and immunologic disorders."

disease. Powerful techniques allow efficient generation and recovery of zebrafish mutations affecting genes
that regulate developmental patterning, organogenesis, physiology, and behavior. Recent advances make it
easy to study gene function in transgenic zebrafish and with antisense oligonucleotides. The functions of
many, if not most of these genes are conserved among vertebrate groups. Thus, analysis of zebrafish
mutations provides insights into gene function in other vertebrates, including humans.
The Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC) has been established as a repository that provides
animals, materials, and services to the research community. This proposal seeks continued funding 1) to serve
as a central repository for zebrafish genetic stocks and research materials, 2) to provide consultation and
pathology services, and 3) to develop feeding and nutrition strategies for zebrafish that support ZIRC and
research community husbandry goals. ZIRC materials, services, and husbandry and health standards will be
made widely available to the research community."

Invasion is required for development and spread of head and neck cancer (HNC) but unfortunately there are
no strategies that effectively target invasion. This knowledge gap is due to limited progress in identifying and
understanding the underlying mechanisms that control invasion. While progress has been made in establishing
that epithelial to mesenchymal transition in HNC cells allows them to spread and become resistant to
treatment, critical mechanistic links are unknown. It is also unclear which tumors will spread and become
resistant to treatment. Given the continued poor survival of patients with HNC, this project will address the
following questions: 1) what are the mechanisms that encourage HNC to spread; 2) how is HNC protected
from radiation and who is at risk for developing resistance; and 3) how does HNC recur. This work will provide
the foundation for novel mechanism-based treatment strategies to improve the survival of patients with HNC."

Currently there are no effective treatments for the millions of traumatic brain injury (TBI)
patients that are seen each year in US clinics; therefore, identifying and developing effective
treatments remains an urgent, unmet need in public health. Our multidisciplinary team has
developed a non-invasive, transcranial neuromodulation technique using nano-pulsed
optoacoustic laser therapy (NPLT). Our proprietary system operates at levels of optical energy
that are eye-safe and skin-safe, easy to deliver, and stress-free for the subject. This technology
combines near-infrared laser light, which reduces brain inflammation and stimulates neuronal
circuitry - but does not penetrate deeply into brain tissue - and optoacoustic waves, that also
reduce inflammation and stimulate neural circuitry - yet they penetrate deeper into brain tissue,
allowing treating areas of the human brain (such as the hippocampus) that are critical for
memory and cognition and are known to be damaged as a result of TBI. We have previously
shown that, in two rat models of TBI, NPLT improves neurocognitive outcomes, reduces
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration and normalizes neurogenesis. In this proposal,
leveraging the combined expertise of a multidisciplinary team of bioengineers, physicians and
neuroscientists who have collectively studied TBI for over 30 years, we will systematically
develop this promising neuromodulation therapy by evaluating the onset and progression of
neuropathology and associated cognitive dysfunctions in rats subjected to fluid percussion
injury (FPI) and treated with NPLT in the acute or chronic phase of TBI. Moreover, we will
conduct a systematic evaluation of how frequency (1 or 5 weekly applications) will affect NPLT
efficacy to mitigate TBI outcomes. At the completion of the proposed studies, it is our
expectation that we will have aided the development of a non-invasive treatment that, by
reducing the onset of TBI-driven neuropathology and cognitive impairments, has the potential
to reduce the global healthcare burden of TBI. The laser used for NPLT has received non-
significant risk status by institutional review boards at UTMB for unrelated clinical
applications thus supporting the feasibility of translating the use of NPLT to human patients
once the work proposed in the present application will be completed."

The mission of the Hamelberg group is to develop computational tools to complement
experiments in elucidating the dynamics-function relationship in biomolecules. The group has
been continuously making significant contributions to theoretical biochemistry and biophysics,
including developing methods for enhanced sampling, free energy calculation, and the analysis
of biomolecular dynamic data, and their applications to diverse biological systems. These
methods, based on molecular dynamics, can reveal at the atomic level of detail the mechanism
of biomolecular function, which is usually difficult to obtain by current experiments. Such detailed
knowledge is essential for the understanding and fine-tuning of (patho)physiological processes,
which can be leveraged for drug discovery and biomolecular design. The group is dedicated to
continuing this endeavor by developing innovative computational tools that are more intimately
coupled with experiments, implementing more advanced algorithms able to better identify
function-related information from complex data, accompanied by well-established systems for
rigorously checking convergence, robustness, and accuracy, and accessible to the broader
community of biochemists. These tools will be tested on diverse biological systems of
pharmaceutical significance. Our work will help resolve the current challenge that, with the rapid
growth of computing power, longer molecular simulations are routinely performed but efficient
computational tools to transform the data into knowledge are missing. We envisage that these
tools will largely enhance the effectiveness of using molecular simulations to interpret
experimental observations and guide new experimental designs by making testable predictions
or hypothesis, hence promoting more collaborations between computational and experimental
labs that will eventually accelerate new biological discoveries."

Young sexual and gender minorities who have sex with men (YSGMSM) carry a disproportionate burden of the
HIV epidemic in the United States, yet Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake and adherence has been
inadequate for these groups. Research into HIV syndemics has illuminated the importance of social and
structural factors for HIV risk, yet the research into HIV syndemics for YSGMSM has been limited to individual
level survey measures. A parallel line of research has used multilevel models to explicitly model neighborhood
factors, however no research to date has applied this modeling technique to understand the direct relationship
between social and structural neighborhood factors and PrEP adherence. Similarly, immersion in digital spaces
(e.g., consumption of social media) can influence HIV risk as well. Despite interventions for PrEP uptake and
adherence being increasingly delivered through digital devices, some of which utilize digital support
communities and the growing culture of digital communication among youth, including YSGMSM, no studies to
date have characterized how digital immersion influences PrEP adherence through a digital PrEP intervention.
Finally, it has been shown that joining non-digital support groups can mitigate neighborhood factors in
YSGMSM and reduce sexual risk behaviors suggesting that a digital PrEP intervention might have the same
capability but with more reach. For these reasons, this research will examine how convergent digital and
neighborhood factors impact PrEP adherence in YSGMSM by leveraging iTech’s P3 study, an NICHD-funded
randomized controlled trial (RCT) to improve PrEP adherence among YSGMSM. This three arm RCT is
designed to assess the effectiveness of P3 and P3+ to improve PrEP adherence among 246 16-24 year-old
YSGMSM across nine US study sites. The study collects residential zip code, allowing for examination of
neighborhood effects on PrEP adherence. Through mentored training in social and structural neighborhood
determinants of PrEP adherence in YSGMSM, multi-level models, mediation analysis, causal inference, and
professional development activities, the proposed F31 will achieve the following specific aims: 1) Characterize
how neighborhood syndemic risk relates to PrEP adherence in YSGSM, 2) Identify how immersion in digital
spaces and communities outside P3’s intervention influence engagement inside P3’s intervention, and
subsequent PrEP adherence, 3) Determine how the P3 intervention condition attenuates the relationship
between syndemic neighborhood and digital immersion factors’ impact on PrEP adherence. These aims will
enrich our understanding of how digital and neighborhood factors impact PrEP adherence, a critical step in
precision preventative health against HIV for YSGMSM. This aligns NICHD priorities for adolescent HIV
prevention with the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the US by 2030 Initiative."

Aging adults play a central role in the formation and maintenance of social ties in traditional settings. Much
observational and experimental work has demonstrated that health effects can spread across such social ties,
affecting the health of the aging adults themselves and also others. Less well understood is whether and how
exogenous interventions might restructure social ties, fundamentally altering the role aging adults play in their
communities and potentially leading to their isolation or compromising their social relevance or health. In an
existing RCT involving 30,862 people aged 12-93 in 176 villages in rural Honduras, we are assessing “social
network targeting algorithms” to maximize the diffusion of public health interventions. Each village is randomly
assigned to have a different percentage of its inhabitants (from 0-100%) get the intervention. In the proposed
work, we wish to evaluate how the introduction (with experimentally varied penetrance) of a public health
intervention might alter the social fabric of the villages, especially among the older adults, focusing on the
4,589 subjects ≥50 years old. The parent RCT provides an ideal platform on which to build the current project,
collecting new data, asking new questions, and performing new analyses. We have four specific aims. First, we
will re-map the complete face-to-face networks of the 30,862 people in the 176 villages, constituting the third
wave of network mapping, roughly 2 years after the completion of our second wave in 2019. The result will be
a very unusual dataset, capturing how the structures of real-world social networks, and the position of aging
adults in them, change over time, in response to randomized exposure to a formal public health intervention.
Our second aim is to quantify changes in the structure of the whole-village-level social networks over a 2-year
interval. Using various statistics that characterize network structure (e.g., degree distribution, transitivity,
network “motifs”), we will assess the stability of village networks. We will also study how aging adults’ social
ties, and in particular health-related social ties, within the villages are affected by the introduction of varying
doses (across villages) of the public health intervention. The introduction of formal institutions might be
expected to attenuate the informal institutions that had previously served the same purpose, leading to
potential social isolation and less relevance of aging adults in these communities. Our third aim is to
characterize changes in the ego-level networks of aging villagers, based on whether their social connections
received (or adopted) the public health intervention. Our fourth aim is to evaluate the impact of exogenously
induced changes in network position upon the subsequent physical and mental health of the elderly. Overall,
our work will allow us to explore experimentally whether and how the social connections of aging adults, the
role of aging adults in networks related to health, and the health of those individuals change when formal
health-relevant institutions are exogenously introduced into a social system."
10831447,"Cocaine dependence is associated with dysfunctional midbrain cortico-limbic-striatal circuits that impact
decision-making processes and lead to the development of compulsive drug-seeking behaviors. Our new and
published data from the prior funding period show that (1) that the reinforcement-learning mechanisms that
predict cocaine-taking behaviors (e.g., positive-outcome updating) differ from those that are disrupted following
cocaine self-administration (e.g., negative-outcome updating), (2) that midbrain D3 BPND is predictive of
cocaine-taking behaviors and related to positive-outcome updating, but cocaine self-administration disrupts
prefrontal cortical (PFC) mGlu5 BPND and is related to negative-outcome updating, and (3) that positive-
outcome updating is controlled by amygdala projections to the PFC whereas negative-outcome updating is
controlled by PFC projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). These findings, collectively, indicate that the
biobehavioral mechanisms that mediate vulnerability to cocaine-taking behaviors differ from those that are
disrupted by chronic cocaine exposure and identify midbrain D3 and cortical mGlu5 receptors as critical
mediators of susceptibility to and consequence of cocaine use, respectively. The functional relevance of
midbrain dopamine D3 and cortical mGlu5 BPND on the neural activity associated with addiction-relevant
behaviors, however, is not known. The studies proposed here will investigate the role of D3 and mGlu5 BPND in
circuit-level mechanisms of decision-making and drug-seeking behaviors in rats. We will use positron emission
tomography (PET) and calcium imaging with fiber photometry to determine how D3 and mGlu5 BPND are
associated with circuit-level activity in rats before and after cocaine self-administration. In Aim 1 we will
investigate the relationship between individual differences in midbrain dopamine D3 BPND and dynamic neural
activity in cortico-limbic circuits during decision making and subsequent cocaine self-administration behaviors.
In Aim 2 we will determine how disruptions in mGlu5 glutamatergic signaling and neural activity mediate
addiction-relevant (seeking/taking) behaviors and alter decision-making strategies after short and long periods
of abstinence from cocaine self-administration. Together, our integrative and novel approach – combining
sophisticated behavioral tasks, computational analyses, in vivo recordings of neural activity with calcium fiber
photometry, and PET imaging – will determine the functional impact and neurobiological mechanisms of
decision-making circuits and their role in addiction vulnerability and pathology."

Our overarching goal is to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the actions of
volatile anesthetics (VAs). Our objective in the studies proposed here, which represent the next step in
pursuing this goal, is to mechanistically define the functions of astrocytes that underly their involvement in the
process of emergence from anesthesia with VAs. We hypothesize, based on substantial recent and preliminary
data, astrocyte mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) function supports normal emergence through
maintenance of astrocyte calcium signaling, gliotransmitter release, and metabolic support to neurons. We
further hypothesize that specific, spatially defined, populations of astrocytes within the central nervous system
(CNS) drive emergence through their local support of neuronal synapses involved in emergence.
Our experiments will take advantage of pure primary astrocyte cell culture, a mouse model for cell-specific
disruption of mitochondrial function through cre-mediated excision of the ETC complex I protein Ndufs4, and
stereotactic microinjection targeted viral delivery of an astrocyte promoter driven cre-recombinase to enable
brain region-specific disruption of Ndufs4 specifically in astrocytes. These models will allow us to characterize
the astrocyte functions impacted by VAs and the population of astrocytes involved in emergence. Specifically,
they will allow us to: i) define the effects of VAs on astrocyte calcium signaling and mitochondrial function, and
the mechanistic links between the two, in vitro; ii) characterize the effects of VAs on astrocyte gliotransmitter
release; iii) characterize the impact of VAs on astrocyte metabolites which support neuronal function; iv) define
the astrocyte population, defined by region, responsible for supporting emergence from anesthesia with VAs.
Ultimately, this work will greatly advance our understanding of the mechanisms of VA activity and the process of
emergence.
Relevance
Despite their prevalence, the precise targets of VAs, and the mechanisms underlying their pleiotropic effects,
are largely undefined. Emergence is a daily occurrence for thousands of patients, but the process of emergence
is poorly understood. Delays in emergence are associated with anxiety, confusion, resistive activity, delays in
the operating room, increased risks of injury, and significant medical costs. If the mechanisms of emergence can
be resolved, it may be possible to develop strategies for active promotion of recovery of consciousness."
10831548,"Treatment of Opioid Use Disorders (OUDs) includes medications with effects on opioid receptors such as
buprenorphine, but access is limited for many patients and others are opposed to treating addictions with
medications that have opioid agonist properties. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that is more acceptable for
many patients, and recent studies show it to be equivalent in efficacy. Initiation of treatment with long-acting
naltrexone, however, requires a period of abstinence of about seven days during which time patients suffer
from intense symptoms of withdrawal with a risk of relapse that can lead to overdose-related death. Opioids
have an inhibitory effect on norepinephrine and the sympathetic nervous system, and many symptoms of
withdrawal are driven by rebound activation of these systems. Dopaminergic systems in brain areas including
ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) and medial prefrontal cortex (anterior cingulate) play an important role in
opioid addiction, craving and relapse, as do increases in inflammation. This project will assess a form of
neuromodulation involving non-invasive electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve that may play a useful role
during the period of opioid withdrawal before the initiation of long-term naltrexone treatment in blocking
norepinephrine, sympathetic, and inflammatory responses and enhancing peripheral parasympathetic and
central brain function in areas modulating drug craving (ventral striatum, anterior cingulate). Our preliminary
data on the effects of non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) on stress response in traumatized human
subjects and patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) show that nVNS reliably blocks peripheral
sympathetic and enhances parasympathetic function, reduces inflammatory responses (interleukin-6, or IL-6),
and enhances central brain responses (anterior cingulate) to stress. We now propose to apply this technology
to the treatment of patients with OUDs. Following verification using modelling and determination of optimal
dosing parameters, we will use these parameters to assess effects of nVNS versus sham stimulation on opioid
craving, peripheral autonomic, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and brain functional responses measured with
High-Resolution Positron Emission Tomography (HR-PET) and radiolabeled water to videos of drug cues in
recently treated patients with OUDs. Based on the outcome of this research, we will proceed to the UH3
phase, which will involve a randomized, sham-controlled trial of nVNS in patients with OUDs during the one to
two week period of opioid withdrawal followed by assessment of craving, HR-PET imaging of both brain
function and brain dopaminergic function, and assessment of peripheral autonomic, cardiovascular and
inflammatory responses in conjunction with administration of nVNS or sham. We hypothesize that nVNS will
reduce opioid craving and inflammatory, peripheral autonomic and cardiovascular responses and enhance
brain responses (anterior cingulate function and dopamine function in ventral striatum), and promote
successful conversion to long-acting naltrexone, in patients with OUDs."
10932370,"PROJECT SUMMARY
At least 37% of patients treated in the emergency department (ED) are discharged without a definitive
diagnosis, thus leaving the encounter with diagnostic uncertainty. Transitions of care are high-risk periods for
patient safety, especially when patients are discharged with diagnostic uncertainty, and thus are still within the
diagnostic process. Effective communication between clinicians and patients is essential to improve the quality
of these care transitions. In prior AHRQ-funded research, we developed several tools to support high quality
discharge in the setting of diagnostic uncertainty, including a communication checklist, a training program for
physicians in uncertainty communication, and a patient-facing 1-page information sheet about being
discharged with uncertainty. We now propose to leverage the electronic health record (EHR) to implement a
multifaceted strategy to facilitate higher quality discharge transitions for patients discharged from the ED with
diagnostic uncertainty. Our Targeted EHR-based Communication about Uncertainty (TECU) strategy will be
activated every time an ED clinician enters an uncertain diagnosis for a patient being discharged, and will
notify the clinician to counsel the patient about uncertainty while additionally triggering automated 1) insertion
and printing of the patient handout, 2) printing of the clinician-facing checklist to guide the discharge
conversation, and 3) sending of an inbox message to the primary care provider (PCP). We will conduct a pre-
post pilot trial with a hybrid type 1 effectiveness implementation design with the goals of: 1) Testing the
preliminary effectiveness of TECU compared to standard of care in reducing patient uncertainty and return ED
visits and 2) Evaluating the adoption of TECU and exploring patient and clinician barriers and facilitators to
TECU implementation. This work will be led by experienced researchers with expertise in health services
research, clinical trials in emergency medicine, patient communication, health literacy, diagnostic uncertainty,
informatics, and implementation science. The TECU strategy will be easily disseminated as it will be built in
Epic, the world’s leading EHR vendor, and will be available for health systems to implement through the Epic
Community Library. This project has potential to significantly impact the quality and safety of care transitions
for the one-third of patients leaving the emergency department with diagnostic uncertainty."

Over 250 million courses of antibiotics are prescribed annually to out-patients in the United States. The perception that
antibiotic use has minimal adverse side effects contributes to their over-use. Since deploying antibiotics seems to be
relatively free of toxicity, there are few disincentives to their use even when perceived benefits are marginal. Recent
understanding of the human microbiome suggests the relevance of antibiotic exposures to health, with the emerging
view that our microbiota are central to human physiology. In animal models, perturbing the microbiota affects
metabolic, immune, and cognitive physiology. Antibiotics diffuse into all body compartments, selecting for resistance.
We propose to examine the effects of two commonly used antibiotics, a beta-lactam (amoxicillin)and a macrolide
(azithromycin) on microbial populations and on metabolic and immune physiology, in healthy volunteers in a
prospective randomized clinical trial conducted at the NIH Clinical Center (CC). We hypothesize that in addition to
acutely perturbing the human microbiome, these agents will have measurable metabolic and immunologic effects, with
effects continuing over the following weeks and months. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1, we assess the effects of a
brief therapeutic antibiotic course on microbiota and metagenome composition. After initial evaluation, antibiotics are
given for 5-7 days, with a prolonged post-treatment evaluation. Specimens are obtained from multiple sites at each of
10 time-points and used to estimate bacterial and fungal composition and gene content. In Aim 2, we assess the effects
of the antibiotic course on immune physiology. At multiple time points, blood is obtained and used to determine
plasma and cellular levels of markers of both innate and adaptive immunity. In Aim 3, we assess the effects of the
antibiotic course on metabolic physiology. The specimens obtained are assessed for markers of metabolic and
hormonal physiology. A subset of subjects enter the unique CC Metabolic Chamber to quantify 24-hour energy
expenditure and carbohydrate and fat utilization. In addition to the primary data analyses, we will build an informatic
model integrating the temporal data to provide insight into the complex interdependent physiology between
microbiome and host. This project is an opportunity to perform comprehensive and integrated evaluations of two
pharmacologic agents prescribed >90 million times annually in the USA. Careful analysis and development of an
integrated model to understand the pathophysiology of the perturbations may identify problems below the radar in
clinical medicine. The purpose of this renewal is to recruit sufficient numbers of subjects to complete the study after the
interruption caused by COVID-19 and the subsequent COVID studies in the Clinical Center. Increasing the number of
subjects to ~20 per group will permit robust analyses of the extent and duration of microbiome changes due to the
antibiotic perturbations, and their consequent effects on host metabolic and immune functionalities, and their
interactions; the present limitations in numbers of participants constrain a thorough analysis."

NPR1 (NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENSIS-RELATED GENES 1) is a master immune regulator in plants. It
orchestrates systemic acquired resistance (SAR) by activating PATHOGENESIS-RELATED (PR) genes in
response to induction of salicylic acid (SA) during the plant response to pathogenic challenges. Extensive genetic
and biochemical studies have shown that NPR1 is a receptor of SA. SA activation of NPR1 triggers genome-
wide transcriptional reprograming via NPR1 interactions with a variety of transcription activators and repressors.
NPR1 itself is regulated by redox agents, and its proteolytic turnover has profound implications in a wide range
of biological functions, including circadian rhythm and resistance to proteotoxic stress in the endoplasmic
reticulum. Despite the essential role of NPR1 in plant biology, the molecular details underlying the myriad of
NPR1 functions have remained largely unknown. Building upon our initial success in elucidating the structure of
apo NPR1 using single-particle cryoEM, here we propose to elucidate the molecular basis of the NPR1 function
in plants. Specifically, we will address (1) how SA activates NPR1, (2) how NPR1 interacts with transcription
factors and regulators, and (3) how NPR1 is degraded. Information gained from these studies will provide the
much-needed mechanistic insights into the SA-NPR1 signaling cascade in plants and help develop disease-
resistant crops. As SA is the principle metabolite of aspirin, such knowledge may also contribute to a better
understanding of the well-documented medicinal benefits of SA and analogs in humans."

Regulatory T (Treg) cells play a fundamental role in enforcing peripheral immunological tolerance to self-antigens,
commensal flora, and innocuous foreign antigens. The transcription factor Foxp3 is indispensable to Treg cell
differentiation and immunoregulatory functions. Loss of function mutations in Foxp3 precipitate a severe
autoimmune inflammatory disorder, while acquired deficiency in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune
conditions destabilizes Treg cells and sustains disease chronicity and severity. Foxp3-deficient Treg (∆Treg) cells
lack suppressor function and manifest an effector T (Teff) cell–like phenotype. Nevertheless, they continue to a
core regulatory transcriptome, indicating the potential to restore their regulatory function. In agreement with this
hypothesis, we have recently demonstrated that Foxp3 deficiency dysregulates metabolic checkpoint mTORC2
signaling and gives rise to augmented aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Specific deletion of the
mTORC2 adaptor gene Rictor in ∆Treg cells greatly ameliorated disease in Foxp3-deficient mice, improved ∆Treg
cells suppressive capacities, and suppressed their Teff cell–like glycolytic and respiratory programs. These
findings established for the first time the potential to reprogram ∆Treg cells in favor of enhanced tolerance, an
approach applicable to both monogenic and common immune dysregulatory diseases. More recently, we have
established that the ∆Treg cells are heterogenous, ranging along a spectrum from cells with high regulatory
potential to ones more advanced towards a Teff cell-like phenotype.
Based on these results, we postulate that Foxp3 deficiency destabilizes ∆Treg cells towards Teff cell-like programs
in a step-wise process that can be reversed by precision interventions to re-establish their regulatory functions.
Specifically, the degeneration of ∆Treg cells in to Teff-like cells involves the transition from a CD25+Foxp1high cell
population into CD25–Foxp1low activated Teff-like cells that ultimately emerge as ex-Treg cells lacking in a Treg cell
epigenetic imprint. The role of IL-2/CD25 and Foxp1 in this transition will be examined using functional and
genetic approaches (Aim 1). Under Aim 2, we will examine the metabolic checkpoints involved in this transition
and the capacity of targeted combinatorial metabolic and functional interventions to reprogram ∆Treg cells in favor
of tolerance. Under Aim 3, we will employ insights gained from our preliminary and proposed studies to reinforce
the regulatory functions of Foxp3-sufficient Treg cells in the context of autoimmune and inflammatory disease
models. The proposed analysis of ∆Treg cell subsets and their modulation by single and combinatorial
interventional strategies represents a novel approach to restoring immune tolerance in monogenic and common
immune dysregulatory diseases, including autoimmune and allergic disorders and graft versus host disease."

Metastasis from the primary tumor site to the brain is the most lethal complication of advanced breast cancer
and is experienced by approximately 20% of breast cancers worldwide. There is at present no approach to
detect if a tumor has brain metastatic potential, no markers that predict successful future metastasis, and thus
no therapies to target any of the processes involved. These gaps are difficult to bridge due to a lack of
technology that can elucidate the underlying mechanisms by classifying a cancer cell based on its brain
metastatic potential. Current in vivo murine models are slow to manifest metastasis and do not have the
capability of capturing single cell morphology and dynamics; and current in vitro models are short lived and
lack software support therefore, we propose an in vitro blood brain niche (µm-BBN) on-a-chip to measure the
phenotypic differences between cancer cells and normal cells and amongst cancer cells as they transit through
the model niche and to assign them a brain metastatic potential. Moreover, we propose capturing the cells that
transit through the BBN for further analysis.
This system is composed of the µm-BBN, an integrated piezo pump and controller, automated phenotyping
software and a classification algorithm. The µm-BBN has two chambers which form a vessel (human brain
endothelial cells and brain stroma (ECM and Normal Human Astrocytes (NHA), Microglia and Pericytes)
separated by a 5µm porous membrane coated with Matrigel. The goal is to culture cancer cells in the device
for up to 20 days using the integrated pump. Expanding on previous work, the cellular phenotype and
migratory behavior of a library of patient cells will be recorded. Generation of phenotypic measures for
individual cancer cells, micro-metastasis and the tumor micro-environment will enable automated profiling of
the metastatic signature of tumor cells. After culture the cells will be recovered and fixed or analyzed to create
a multi-omic readout enabling a complimentary cellular and molecular signature for single cells and sub-
populations of metastatic cancer cells.
This work will enable improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms of brain metastasis and,
downstream from it, in a more robust set of targetable pathways for prevention of brain metastasis."

The Drugs of Abuse Training Program prepares predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows for
successful independent careers in the field of substance abuse research. This program has been the
cornerstone of interdisciplinary basic science training in addiction, drugs of abuse, and HIV/AIDS at
Temple University since 1988. This application is requesting continuation of the program at the current
level of support, 6 predoctoral students and 4 postdoctoral fellows. The Drugs of Abuse Training
Program is administered through the Center for Substance Abuse Research (CSAR) at the Lewis Katz
School of Medicine. CSAR brings together faculty from multiple disciplines who share a common
interest in researching topics related to the neurobiology of addiction, pharmacology of drugs of abuse,
and the intersection of drugs of abuse with immune function including HIV/AIDS. This common goal
creates a rich, highly collaborative environment for trainees who’s research often extends beyond a
single laboratory. The Drugs of Abuse Training Program is supported by a cadre of dedicated faculty
mentors who are devoted to the education and training of the next generation of scientists. These
faculty are highly successful researchers as evidenced by their excellent extramural research funding
and strong publication records. The program provides rigorous training in scientific methods,
experiment design, data analysis, and research ethics. It includes didactic instruction through a set of
core courses and seminars focusing on the pharmacology of drugs of abuse, neurobiology of addiction,
and neuroimmunology. Excellence in scientific communication is achieved through coursework and
practical opportunities for written and oral presentations. Participation in seminars, meetings with
visiting scientists, journal club, scientific retreats, annual self-assessments and faculty evaluations of
progress results in trainees who are exceedingly well-prepared for the next step in their scientific
careers. The program promotes the highest level of scientific integrity and ethics, along with personal
and public accountability in the conduct of science. The Drugs of Abuse Training Program at Temple
University has been effective in recruiting outstanding trainees including individuals from diverse
backgrounds and has a near perfect record of retention. Trainees complete the program with excellent
credentials and go on to successful careers in academia, industry, government and other science-
related employment, thus fulfilling the NIH directive to improve human health. The Drugs of Abuse
Training Program is a critical resource for supporting students and postdoctoral fellows and advancing
the field of substance abuse research."
10849856,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 As the share of U.S. older population and number of people living with Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementias (ADRD) continue to grow rapidly, marked racial and ethnic gaps in prevalence and incidence of
ADRD and ADRD-attributable health care persist. This study aims to deepen our understanding of racial/ethnic
disparities in ADRD and related health care utilization using a life course approach. We will utilize appropriate
machine learning (ML) approaches to examine how life course factors, especially early-life circumstances, may
accumulate over the life course in ways that differ across populations to shape ADRD risk and its racial/ethnic
disparities; how risk factors in midlife and later life may explain racial/ethnic disparities in ADRD-attributable
health care use and outcomes for persons with ADRD. Identifying ADRD risk in the preclinical stage is crucial,
our holistic life course approach holds promise in enhancing prevention at the population level and addressing
racial/ethnic gaps.
 Our overarching goal is to address ADRD-related health and health care inequities, guided by novel
evidence starting from early stages of life, and ideally delay the onset or slow the progression of ADRD. To
achieve our overall goal, we will adapt ML to a comprehensive set of data linking longitudinal survey, medical
claims, and life history information for non-Hispanic Blacks (Blacks), Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Whites
(Whites) in 1995-2018 Health and Retirement Study (HRS).
 We will pursue four specific aims: 1) develop and validate ML and other models for ADRD prediction,
examining multifactorial influences of life course factors; 2) understand individual and collective contributions of
early-life circumstances to ADRD and its racial/ethnic gap; 3) examine the effect of incident ADRD on health
care use and its dynamics pre- and post- ADRD diagnosis, and racial/ethnic gaps; 4) investigate the extent to
which midlife and later-life factors may mediate the effects of ADRD on health care and its racial/ethnic gap.
 This study will add significant value to narrowing disparities in ADRD and its health care, by using ML
algorithms to explore the role of a uniquely rich set of life course factors on racial/ethnic gaps in ADRD; by
augmenting a diverse and nationally representative longitudinal survey with administrative data to
systematically examine ADRD and racial/ethnic gaps in health care. Taken together, these findings will inform
1) development of risk prediction models for ADRD to offer a cost-effective approach for population-level
screening in the preclinical stage, identification of risk factors and groups at elevated risk of ADRD for targeted
preventive interventions; 2) products that can aid individuals and clinicians in making informative assessments;
and 3) policies addressing ADRD-attributable health and health care inequity starting from early stages of life,
leveraging midlife and later-life mediators, and ideally delaying the onset or progression of ADRD."

10849903,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nearly 6 million people worldwide are infected with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas
disease, and vertical transmission accounts for 22% of all new infections. Between 5-10% of T. cruzi-infected
women will transmit the infection to their children, leading to a spectrum of disease in the infant: the majority of
infected infants are asymptomatic but up to 40% have systemic disease involving the heart, brain, or liver.
Congenital infection can also result in premature birth, or, in rare cases, neonatal death. Nearly a third of
infants, even those with no symptoms, will develop chronic cardiac and gastrointestinal problems later in life.
Unfortunately, up to 75% of affected infants do not receive timely diagnosis or treatment. Most T. cruzi
infections occur in resource-limited rural areas of Latin America where advanced diagnostic tools are
unavailable. Because treatment is safer and more effective during infancy than in older children and adults,
early diagnosis is critical. Infected infants will continue to miss their opportunity for lifesaving treatment until we
develop better algorithms to identify high-risk infants and accurately diagnose congenital Chagas disease in
the perinatal period. Our long-term goal is to accelerate the elimination of congenital Chagas disease by
developing tools to predict and diagnose T. cruzi infections in infants. In this project, we propose to (1) identify
maternal clinical and epidemiological risk factors for vertical transmission; (2) investigate the parasite’s
mechanisms of invading through the placenta using parasite genotyping and identifying gene expression
signatures associated with transmission; and (3) optimize and validate a new test for congenital T. cruzi
infection using recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), a DNA detection method that can be performed
without advanced laboratory equipment or expertise and is adaptable to point-of-care platforms. To accomplish
these goals, we propose a cohort study of pregnant women and their infants in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, a highly
endemic area for T. cruzi. We hypothesize that by combining traditional epidemiological analyses with cutting-
edge genomic techniques, we can better predict which infants born to women infected with T. cruzi are at
highest risk of congenital infection. We also hypothesize that a new RPA assay will allow us to diagnose these
infants more frequently and earlier than current standard diagnostics, which perform poorly to detect congenital
infection in neonates. In Aim 1, we will identify risk factors for vertical transmission in a cohort of T. cruzi-
infected women to better identify high-risk infants. In Aim 2, we will characterize parasite genetic factors
associated with vertical transmission of T. cruzi using genotyping and transcriptomics. Finally, in Aim 3, we will
optimize our RPA assay and test it in the clinical setting to evaluate its ability to diagnose neonates with
congenital Chagas disease. Our innovative approach will integrate field epidemiology, cutting-edge sequencing
techniques, and new diagnostics to identify infected infants in the first weeks of life. These advances have the
potential to lead to a paradigm shift to accelerate cure of Chagas disease’s youngest victims."
10849905,"The progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to fibrotic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is
emerging as the leading cause of liver disease. Until mid-2021, the genetic etiology of NAFLD/NASH in humans has
been limited to a handful of loci. To address this gap, we and others have recently identified 657 novel loci associated
with several quantitative traits linked with NAFLD/NASH. While these new and prior discovery studies have
established secure links between genetic loci and NAFLD/NASH risk, a number of uncertainties continue to exist
about such findings, including: (a) the causal gene(s) at these loci; (b) the directional impact of these loci on disease
risk; and (c) the biological mechanisms leading to disease risk. Moreover, all prior discovery efforts have been limited
to: (d) common variant discovery platforms; (e) populations of European descent; and (f) use of proxy definitions of
NAFLD/NASH based on AST and ALT levels. We aim to resolve these uncertainties and find loci of high therapeutic
relevance by capitalizing on the Pakistan Genomic Resource (PGR), that has leveraged high levels of consanguinity
in Pakistan and assembled the largest cohort of human knockouts (KOs) in the world and a cohort of 4,000
ultrasonography (USG)-confirmed NAFLD cases. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will: (i) perform multi-ethnic association
analyses for rare and common variants in 700,000 participants (PGR + UK Biobank) for serum AST and ALT levels
and conduct validation studies in 4,000 USG-confirmed NAFLD cases and 4,000 controls; (ii) conduct fine-mapping
studies and colocalization analyses; (iii) perform rare variant gene burden tests, focusing on predicted loss of
function (pLoF) and predicted damaging variants (pDM) variants; (iv) conduct pathway analyses and (v) for 10 highly
prioritized loci, conduct call-back studies of pLoF carriers, along with their family members, to drive causal gene
identification and translation. In Aim 2, we will investigate two high priority genes already identified from the analyses
proposed in Aim 1, WWP2 and CASP8, to illustrate how such genes can be studied mechanistically and in
experimental NASH. For WWP2, we hypothesized based on its E3 ligase activity that it is protective by down-
regulating a key protein in fibrotic NASH, TAZ (WWTR1), which is now supported by our exciting preliminary in vitro
and in vivo data. CASP8 is an example of a NASH-promoting gene based on data from Aim 1 and prior mouse
studies, but the mechanisms are uncertain and likely not related to its canonical cell-death function. Here we will test
the hypothesis that PGR pLoF/pDM variants at WWP2 and CASP8, when introduced into hepatocytes of mice
lacking the endogenous genes, affect NASH as predicted from the human data and our hypotheses. We will also
probe the 2 genes' mechanisms in vitro and in experimental NASH and how the mechanism is affected by pLoF/pDM
variants. In Aim 3, we will investigate impact of genetic loci on disease progression by leveraging available serial
VCTE measurements available in 4,000 USG-confirmed NAFLD cases enrolled in PGR. Second, to investigate
pleiotropy and safety implications, we will conduct association tests with multiple traits in > 700,000 participants and
conduct in-depth deep phenotyping clinical studies on human KOs and consanguineous family members."
10861324,"Systems Genetics of Tuberculosis. Overall Program
Abstract:
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection outcomes are highly variable. Most individuals
contain the infection and remain asymptomatic for a lifetime. A fraction of those infected develop
disease; and even among these patients, the timing, location, and presentation of the pathology
is remarkably diverse. This variability is also evident in the efficacy of both chemotherapy and
vaccination. While this heterogeneity represents a great challenge for TB control efforts, the
biological determinants of Mtb infection outcome have been difficult to define due to the
complexity of contributing factors. Both human and bacterial populations are genetically and
phenotypically diverse, and interactions between this genetic complexity and a variety of
environmental factors ultimately determines clinical course. To overcome this complexity, we
leveraged new mammalian and bacterial genetic resources to create a model system that can
be used to study the effect of each of these variables in isolation and in combination. Host
diversity is incorporated using mice from the Collaborative Cross (CC) and Diversity Outbred
(DO) resources, newly generated reference panels that reflect the diversity of an outbred
population. Bacterial variation is incorporated using large panels of Mtb strains that reflect both
naturally- and experimentally-generated diversity. Controlled interventions, such as vaccination,
can be overlaid on this host- pathogen diversity. Using this highly-tractable system, our program
discovered that the combinatorial complexity of these interactions converge on a discrete
number of biological pathways that influence outcome. Supported by the cutting-edge mouse
and human genetic, genomic, and analytical resources provided by the Cores, our SGTB
program will now focus on parallel studies in this model system and human clinical samples to
identify and dissect the pathways that influence outcome. This structure will ensure that
mechanistic mouse studies are linked to relevant human phenotypes. Ultimately, these insights
will be leveraged to develop more precise correlates of risk, more specific diagnostics based on
clinical phenotypes, and new strategies for the optimization and preclinical development of
vaccines."

10840808,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Impressive survival gains for children and adolescents with cancer have been, in part, attributable to the
provision of intensive therapies. However, as a result, most children suffer and experience severe and
distressing treatment-related symptoms. In adult cancer patients, routine collection of patient-reported
outcomes (PROs) improves quality of life (QoL), and delivery of care consistent with clinical practice guidelines
(CPGs) improves outcomes. However, little has been done in these areas for pediatric cancer patients. Thus,
we developed SSPedi (Symptom Screening in Pediatrics Tool) and SPARK (Supportive care Prioritization,
Assessment and Recommendations for Kids). SSPedi is a self-reported 15 item symptom screening tool for
children receiving cancer treatment; it is reliable, valid and responsive to change in children 8-18 years.
SPARK is a web-based application that consists of two components: (1) a symptom screening component
centered on SSPedi; and (2) a supportive care CPG component. Specific aims are among children with newly
diagnosed cancer, to determine if three times weekly symptom feedback to healthcare providers using SPARK
for 8 weeks and care pathways based on CPGs, when compared with usual care: (1) improves overall self-
reported symptom scores (total SSPedi score); fatigue (PROMIS–Fatigue); and cancer-specific QoL (PedsQL
3.0 Acute Cancer Module); and (2) improves symptom documentation, provision of interventions for symptoms,
and emergency department visits and unplanned clinic visits and hospitalizations.
 We propose a cluster randomized trial including 20 institutions. We will include children with cancer who
are 8-18 years; speak English, Spanish or French; and have any newly diagnosed cancer with a plan for any
treatment. For sites randomized to the intervention group (n=10), symptom screening using SPARK will be
prompted three times weekly for 8 weeks with symptom reports provided to primary physicians and nurses
(children may report symptoms more often if they wish). We will also adapt template care pathways based
upon CPGs for symptom management for each intervention site. Control group (n=10) institutions will
continue their usual care for symptom management. Conduct of routine symptom screening and availability of
local CPGs and care pathways for symptom management will be recorded at all sites. For both groups, self-
reported SSPedi (primary outcome), fatigue and QoL will be measured at baseline, week 4 (±1) and week 8
(±1). We will include 444 children at 20 institutions. The entire trial will require less than 5 years to complete.
 In order to improve symptom control in pediatric cancer, we need a feasible mechanism by which children
with cancer can be enabled to report and track symptoms, for this information to be readily available to
clinicians and to facilitate clinician adherence to supportive care CPGs for symptom management through
creation of clinical care pathways. We anticipate the results to have a substantive impact on the care for
pediatric cancer patients and on their QoL outcomes."
10841650,"Core A, Abstract
This technology core, Metabolomics and Lipidomics Core, aims to provide systems level biochemical insight into
the function of key genes, proteins and non-coding RNAs required for adaptation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(Mtb) to disease relevant stressors. To do so, it will make use of a suite of metabolomic technologies largely
pioneered by this core and specifically developed for studies of Mtb physiology. Despite the widely recognized
importance of metabolism as a quantitative source of biosynthetic precursors and energy, growing evidence has
established its importance as an equally important and specific qualitative mediator of nearly all physiologic
processes. Metabolomics is thus emerging as a window into systems level biochemistry.
This core will specifically provide biologically unbiased metabo-lipidomic readouts of: (i) the in vitro activities of
key genes, proteins and non-coding RNAs required for adaptation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to
disease relevant stressors; and (ii) the identities and activities of their physiologically linked pathways in wild
type and genetically engineered Mtb strains. The Core’s Specific Aims are to: (1) Resolve the in vitro biochemical
activities of purified recombinant Mtb proteins of unknown function or only class-level annotation; (2) Perform
unbiased metabo-lipidomic comparisons of wild type and genetically manipulated Mtb strains; and (3) Perform
unbiased activity-based metabolomic comparisons of Mtb proteomes."
10841651,"Core B, Abstract
The overall goal of this program project is to understand key pathways in the biology of Mtb that are important
in the pathogen’s adaptation to disease-relevant stress conditions – including moving from genetic and molecular
characterization to a biochemical understanding of function. Ultimately this requires both purified proteins, and
enzymatic or binding assays. The Sacchettini lab has considerable experience with both protein expression, and
purification as well as with developing biochemical assays to investigate protein function. While they usually
focus on essential enzymes, the methods used can be applied to most biological macromolecules. The
Sacchettini laboratory also serves as an important interface to the TB Structural Genomics Consortium (TBSGC)
and when appropriate they will provide access to structural resources in order to help determine function. They
will produce recombinant protein and develop assays for all projects within the program project, utilizing methods
developed in the lab or published methods. For those cases where there is no first hand or published information,
they will use their general strategy for making soluble and active Mtb proteins, that they have adopted from their
structural genomics pipeline for high throughout cloning, expression and purification.
The Core’s work on defining the biochemical function of the target proteins will rely heavily on interactions with
the metabolomics core (Core A). This will not be an obstacle as these labs currently work closely on several
projects. In addition, the Core will use standard bioinformatic methods to help understand what the amino
sequence suggests about function, in addition to structures of similar proteins. The core will perform two main
activities:
Activity 1: Clone, overexpress and purify recombinant Mtb proteins for functional analysis using in
vitro biochemical characterization and assays.
Activity 2: Develop in vitro biochemical assays for project proteins."
10841653,"Project 1, Abstract
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has to adapt to acidic niches inside the host, which include macrophages
phagosomes and the caseum of granulomas. Previous work led to the identification of acid resistance genes,
that enable Mtb to survive severe acid stress. The key pathways and underlying mechanisms that that enable
Mtb to adapt to and replicate in mildly acidic conditions, a requirement for its ability to transmit from one host to
another, are incompletely understood.
The central hypothesis driving this project is that exposure to acidic pH triggers a reprogramming of Mtb’s
metabolism towards lipid and fatty acid catabolism which facilitates growth and remodeling of its cell surface
lipids. We propose to (i) determine the importance of fatty acid and lipid metabolism from intra- and extracellular
stores for adaptation to and growth at acidic pH, (ii) determine the impact of acid pH on Mtb’s cell envelope
composition and define the importance of pH-dependent cell envelope remodeling for Mtb stress resistance and
(iii) define the genetic and physical structure of pathways required for Mtb’s adaptation to and growth at acidic
pH. These activities directly contribute to our overall program goal to understand key pathways in Mtb biology,
with a particular focus on complex pathways that are important for the adaptation to disease-relevant stress."
10841587,"Project Summary/Abstract
For patients with symptomatic bradyarrhythmias, the current and only treatment is to implant an electronic
pacemaker. Nearly all of the current research regarding rhythm management, including the leadless pacemakers,
are invested in incremental progress in miniaturizing the indwelling devices. While the devices can provide stable
and long-term pacing, the technology is far from ideal with problems inherent to the pacing technology and to
foreign body issues due to the indwelling hardware. The problems can be severe for pediatric patients with
congenital heart block as multiple and invasive surgeries are needed for replacement or revision of the implanted
devices over the patients’ lifetime. Device-related acute problems are rising as well, include infections with the
generator and/or leads wire, which require surgical removal of the entire implanted device.
Bioengineered pacemakers, in contrast, transcend all current modalities by creating hardware-free cardiac
pacing. We have previously demonstrated that minimally-invasive delivery of a natural transcription factor gene
could pace the ventricles in both small and large animal models of complete heart block. The enabling technology
is based on regenerative tissue engineering in which ordinary heart muscle is converted to specialized
pacemaker tissue construct in situ with a focally delivered genetic construct. To advance this concept to clinical
practice, two questions need to be answered: 1) how long can the bioengineered pacemaker retain its function,
and 2) how well the bioengineered pacemaker be able to function in diseased myocardium since most patients
with a pacemaker are also presented with underlying diseases in the myocardium. In this proposal, we will
directly answer these questions by employing chronic heart block models that are known to elicit traits of heart
failure, and examining the efficacy and durability of the gene therapy in a longitudinal study."

This shared instrument proposal requests funding for a Zeiss Light Sheet 7 to be incorporated into the MicRoN
(Microscopy Resources on the North Quad) core at Harvard Medical School. Imaging of whole organs and thick
tissue samples in a more physiological context has become the next frontier in many areas of biomedical
research. Traditionally, researchers rely on extracting information about cellular components within a two-
dimensional section of tissue instead of the entire volume of the sample. Because most of components in tissues
and organisms are not contained in a 2D plane, quantitative volumetric imaging would enhance our
understanding of their development, structure and function. Due to its high imaging speed, light efficiency, low
photo-toxicity, and inherent optical sectioning capabilities, light-sheet microscopy has emerged as a powerful
tool to accomplish this mode of imaging in both live and fixed, optically cleared samples. Unlike many instruments
currently available, the one we are proposing to purchase provides a great deal of versatility and flexibility in
applications, ranging from live cell imaging of organisms and organs/organoids to imaging fixed thick samples
that have been optically cleared with either water-based (expansion, CLARITY, CUBIC) or solvent-based (iDisco)

10843664,"Cigarette smoking during adolescence is common and leads to several long-term adverse consequences.
Preclinical studies have found that adolescent rats are more sensitive to the rewarding effects of nicotine and
that adolescent rats exposed to nicotine are more sensitive to illicit drug administration including
methamphetamine in adulthood. This increased sensitivity to methamphetamine after adolescent nicotine
exposure may be a result of enhanced neuroinflammation. Specifically, nicotine increases microglia activation
during adolescence and microglia activation is now known to be an important contributor to addictive behavior.
The current project proposes to use an intravenous methamphetamine self-administration procedure to further
explore the effects of nicotine exposure on the reinforcing properties of methamphetamine in adolescent
rats. Both male and female rats will be used as female rats are typically excluded from preclinical
investigations, however our preliminary data using oral self-administration indicate that female rats show a
greater nicotine enhancement of methamphetamine intake after adolescent nicotine exposure. In Specific Aim
1, we will use intravenous self-administration to determine if adolescent nicotine increases methamphetamine
intake, reinstatement, or relapse in male and female rats in a sex dependent manner. In Specific Aim 2 we will
determine if inflammation is responsible for alterations in methamphetamine self-administration. To this end
we will treat rats with the anti-inflammatory drug, roflumilast before assessing drug seeking and
methamphetamine intake. We will also determine the impact of inflammation by measuring if rats treated with
nicotine during adolescence have greater expression of inflammatory markers including IBA1, TNF-α and IL-6.
Understanding the relationship between adolescent nicotine exposure and later methamphetamine abuse will
help identify new and hopefully better therapeutic interventions."
10842693,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Generating diverse cell types from a limited number of progenitor cells in development is a significant
challenge in multicellular organisms. Through asymmetric cell division (ACD), progenitor cells divide to renew
themselves and create new cell types. A key process of ACD is the polarization of progenitor cells. Our
research aims to elucidate design principles that govern cell polarization, divisional asymmetry, and the
coordination of cell division and cell-fate determination in plant ACD.
Stomata are microscopic pores in a plant's epidermis. In the model plant Arabidopsis, stomatal development
and patterning provide an excellent platform for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying cell polarity-
driven ACD in plants. The PI identified BASL (Breaking of Asymmetry in the Stomatal Lineages) as the first
intrinsic polarity protein in Arabidopsis that controls stomatal ACD. BASL functions as a paralog of the
conserved PAR proteins in metazoans. Our research, supported by the NIH since 2014, has made significant
contributions to the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying stomatal ACD. Specifically,
we revealed that BASL functions as a scaffold protein that dynamically assembles specific signaling
components required for each step of stomatal ACD. Before ACD, the BIN2 GSK3 (Glycogen synthase
kinase)-like kinases are polarized to maintain a high cell-division potential. After ACD, a YODA MAPK
(Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase) signaling cascade associated with the polarity module promotes cell-fate
differentiation. Furthermore, we identified the BSL1 (bri1 Suppressor 1-like 1) phosphatase that, upon mitosis,
becomes polarized to dissociate BIN2 while activating YODA at the plasma membrane. Thus, the BSL1
molecular switch enables the transition from cell division to cell-fate differentiation during stomatal ACD.
Additionally, our group has determined that polarization of the peripheral membrane protein BASL requires
vesicle trafficking regulated by the PRAF (PH, RCC1, and FYVE) endosomal proteins. PRAFs interact with
GNOM, an activator of Arf GTPases that plays pivotal roles in endocytic recycling in plants. The discoveries of
BSL1 and PRAF represent major milestones in our recent research and offer profound insights into the current
understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying cell polarization and plant ACD.
In the next five years, by employing a comprehensive approach combining genetics, biochemistry, advanced
cell biology, and proteomics/phosphoproteomics, we aim to (1) understand how regulators of membrane
trafficking control targeted vesicle delivery to establish the polarity domain at the plasma membrane, and (2)
determine how cell-cycle regulation coordinates with the dynamic assembly of polarity proteins in stomatal
ACD. Both directions emerge from our recent discoveries and represent significant areas of inquiry. In addition,
we will implement and optimize the usage of TurboID and its variants to enable the spatial and temporal
precision of proximity labeling in living plant cells."
10842695,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although the early embryos of humans and other vertebrates have pluripotent cells that can differentiate into all
cell types of the animal, these flexible cells are absent in adults. In contrast, many invertebrate animals
maintain pluripotency beyond embryogenesis, and harbor adult pluripotent stem cells (aPSCs) that enable
whole-body regeneration. The long-term goal of the PI’s research program is to obtain a mechanistic
understanding of how pluripotent stem cells are made, retained, and regulated in vivo such that they can
regenerate any missing cell type in an adult animal. Across 750 million years of animal evolution, cells operate
on conserved principles, thus invertebrate species that maintain pluripotent stem cells in adult animals can
serve as informative model systems. The overall objective in this application is to identify the molecular and
cellular mechanisms that regulate aPSCs called “neoblasts” in the acoel Hofstenia miamia. Hofstenia can
regenerate any missing cell type and is amenable to high-throughput functional studies of regeneration. The
rationale for choosing a new model system over planarians, the more established system for studying
neoblasts, is that Hofstenia produces manipulable embryos in large numbers, allowing the use of methods
such as transgenesis, currently unavailable in planarians, to answer outstanding questions about neoblast
biology. The experiments proposed here will combine lineage-tracing methods with functional genomics
approaches to uncover and characterize critical regulatory control of pluripotent cells, asking three major
questions: 1) Which genome-wide chromatin regulatory landscapes and transcriptional programs control the
establishment and retention of pluripotent cells in embryos? 2) Which chromatin regulatory mechanisms and
cellular dynamics enable neoblasts to achieve pluripotency during regeneration? 3) Which cellular mechanisms
allow neoblast progeny to assemble into functional tissues? Isolation of the neoblast lineage followed by
transcriptome and chromatin profiling in Hofstenia embryos, techniques that have been feasible in the
applicants’ hands, will be utilized to identify chromatin landscapes and their regulators. Transgenesis, a
technique recently developed in Hofstenia by the PI, will be used to specifically label neoblast subpopulations
to trace their fates. Live imaging of differentiating neoblast progeny and functional studies of cell adhesion
genes will be used to study how fate decisions are integrated with cell adhesion to enable assembly of newly
regenerated tissues. In all research directions, RNA interference or CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, two
approaches that are feasible in this system, will be used to study gene function. This proposal is innovative in
its use of a novel model system that has enabled new approaches, including the labeling and isolation of
specific cell lineages, for studying long-standing questions about stem cell biology and regeneration. This
project will reveal basic molecular and cellular principles for the regulation of pluripotent cells that have the
potential to inform the development of new applications in human regenerative medicine."

Background: Understanding the origin and fate of genetic variation relies on accurate measurement of that
genetic variation. Until recently, whole genome sequencing approaches exhibited blind spots regarding vast
swaths of genomes comprising repetitive regions, despite repeated demonstrations of the importance of
mutations involving gene duplications, tandem duplications, TE insertions, and other structural changes that are
associated with repeats. Indeed, such mutations are often targets of adaptation, are associated with variation in
human traits, play causative roles in many genetic diseases, and often play key roles in important phenotypes
in species that coexist with humans (e.g. conferring pesticide resistance to human disease vectors). Despite this,
surveys of genetic variation typically continue to select techniques based on convenience and cost-effectiveness.
Indeed, even standard long-read sequencing approaches fail to recover >15% of the genome. A better way would
be to apply emerging methods capable of resolving all regions, particularly ensemble approaches combining
highly accurate and ultra-long sequencing technologies and long-range scaffolding techniques. Such
approaches have already proven capable both of reducing the uncertainty in inferring structural mutations and
of saving analysis time. Projects can now plausibly aim to obtain accurate, full genetic catalogs of each
chromosome, from telomere to telomere. Now is the ideal time to discover and make inferences on the full
spectrum of genetic mutations.
Proposal: The Emerson lab’s research focuses on the evolution of genome structure, particularly mutations that
add, subtract, or otherwise refashion genome sequence on large scales. We apply cutting edge sequencing,
computational, and statistical techniques to discover and interpret structural genetic variation in the most
recalcitrant regions in the genome, using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. Over the next five years,
our goal is to identify all structural genetic variation in samples within and between species, infer the evolutionary
forces acting on them, and understand their functional consequences. We will adapt cutting-edge telomere-to-
telomere approaches to extend our reach into every region of the genome to obtain an exhaustive inventory of
genetic variation within and between species, eliminating the thorny problem of genotype-based ascertainment
bias and error in evolutionary inference. In doing so, we will develop tools to aid in genome assembly, structural
variant genotyping, and evolutionary analysis. We will also use functional genomics techniques to understand
how perturbing primary genome structure changes genome function. Finally, we will identify individual candidate
mutations for functional characterization using reverse genetics. With such comprehensive surveys of genetic
variation, we can finally meet the challenge of discovering all classes of genetic variation to study the evolution
of genome structure and function."
10842881,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Biological sex in placental mammals is determined by their X and Y chromosomes, which, though once
a pair, diverged after the Y was confined to the male germline, and progressively lost most of its ancestral
genes. To maintain dosage parity of X-linked genes with XY males, XX females evolved a mechanism to
randomly silence one X in each cell during early development, a process termed X chromosome inactivation
(XCI). However, some genes evolved to escape XCI and resist attrition on the Y. These “escapee” genes
are expressed from two copies in males and females alike, because development is sensitive to their
dosage. Indeed, lack of the second sex chromosome (monosomy-X) causes miscarriage in many placental
mammals. Another group of genes is specific to the X, but nonetheless escapes XCI, and thereby
contributes to sex-divergent gene expression.
 The relevance of genes escaping XCI to human health and development is evidenced by sex
differences in disease, monosomy-X leading all causes of miscarriage, and live-born Turner syndrome (TS),
which predisposes TS females to fatal cardiac events due to altered metabolism and vascular
malformations. Yet, it remains unknown how and which escapees contribute to this outsized health burden,
because far fewer genes escape XCI in the pre-eminent mouse model, which therefore tolerates
monosomy-X without miscarriage and little developmental impact overall.
 To address this gap, we generated monosomy-X alongside isogenic euploid human induced pluripotent
stem cells (hiPSCs) from male and female samples mosaic for the second sex chromosome. We exploited
this unique resource to demonstrate impaired placental gene expression in a trophoblast model of
monosomy-X, and herein propose to extend these studies to link specific X/Y gene pairs and downstream
pathways to this miscarriage-relevant phenotype. Our deep characterization of euploid XX hPSCs also
revealed that escapee genes likely seed X reactivation when XCI master regulator XIST is repressed. Here,
we propose to use novel hPSC lines we since established to elucidate the mechanisms of XCI, escape and
reactivation, all of which have remained largely enigmatic in humans. Our sophisticated epigenetic tools
enable de novo establishment and maintenance of XCI in female hPSCs, which also will benefit the
generation of validated and stable hiPSC lines for in vitro modeling of X-linked disease and sex differences.
We anticipate this research program to ultimately yield mechanistic insights that may inform new means for
reactivation of functional alleles in heterozygous females manifesting X-linked recessive and dominant
disorders, and provide molecular-genetic approaches towards dissecting escapee gene contributions to TS
and human sex differences."

 Light is a profoundly important regulator of physiology and behavior across a wide range of organisms.
Light information is relayed from the retina to the brain via glutamate released from retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs) at more than 40 brain regions, with some RGCs also co-releasing peptide transmitters. Despite the
prevailing dogma that all RGCs release glutamate, there have been hints that some RGCs may be GABAergic.
However, the identity and function of these potentially GABAergic RGCs is completely unknown. Our recent
findings indicate that a subset of the melanopsin-expressing, intrinsically photosensitive (ip)RGCs are
GABAergic. This proposal will test the overarching hypothesis that GABA release from the melanopsin-
expressing, intrinsically photosensitive (ip)RGCs influences non-image forming behaviors. The aims of this
proposal will define the types and targets of GABAergic RGCs and their role in visual behavior using a
combination of mouse genetics, channelrhodopsin-based circuit tracing, anatomy, patch clamp
electrophysiology, and behavior. In addition to mapping the identity and function of GABAergic RGCs, these
studies will open up new areas of research into the role of inhibitory circuits in light-driven behavior and
physiology."

 Gastrulation is a pivotal process in mammalian embryogenesis that is essential for the establishment of
definitive germ layers and the formation of the body plan. Despite decades of research, the precise mechanisms
that regulate cell differentiation, migration, and patterning during mammalian gastrulation remain poorly
understood, particularly in primates. The study of primate gastrulation is especially challenging because this
process occurs after the embryo has implanted into the uterus, making it difficult to directly observe. Recently,
several three-dimensional (3D), stem cell-based models of primate embryos, termed “stembryos”, have been
developed for in vitro studies of embryonic development. However, most approaches for generating stembryos
exploit the inherent self-organizing capacity of stem cells to form 3D constructs and are unable to precisely
control the number of cells and cell types per construct. A lack of tools for engineering stembryos has resulted
in low yields and has limited the ability of stembryos to faithfully recapitulate primate gastrulation.
 We have recently developed a stembryo model using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from
chimpanzees along with an optofluidic (i.e., combination of optogenetic and microfluidic) device for performing
Chip-based, High-throughput Investigations into Morphogenesis in Primates, called the OptoCHIMP platform.
Our OptoCHIMP platform utilizes microfluidic encapsulation to place cells into hydrogel droplets. A downstream
droplet sorter unit allows us to select droplets of interest with prescribed cell numbers of cell ratios. This enables
us to fabricate stembryos in a precise and high-throughput manner. In this proposal, we will utilize the
OptoCHIMP platform to define the roles that 3D structure, local tissue mechanics, and spatiotemporal signaling
dynamics play in symmetry breaking during primate gastrulation. By utilizing optogenetic tools to stimulate
signaling pathways in chimpanzee stembryos, we can recreate the complex interplay of signaling
pathways between embryonic and extraembryonic tissues, induce symmetry breaking in our stembryo, and
develop a model for understanding how morphogen signaling dynamics impact tissue patterning. This proposal
will be the first time that microfluidic droplet encapsulation of stem cells, which offers precise control over the
initial conditions, has been combined with optogenetic, providing a promising approach to uncovering the
mechanisms that drive primate gastrulation."
10826331,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
Hispanic/Latino populations in the United States (U.S.) carry a disproportionate burden of poor cardiometabolic
health outcomes, with higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia than non-Hispanic White
populations. However, the Hispanic/Latino population is diverse and has significant heterogeneity in
cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevalence and CVD risk by factors such as country of origin and
socioeconomic status (SES). Limited research has investigated how immigration status as a social stressor
contributes to cardiometabolic health and epigenetic aging among Hispanic/Latino populations. Immigrants in
general face greater threats to their health due to lower SES, limited English proficiency, and reduced health
care access and use. However, differences in CVD risk and epigenetic aging also exist by immigration status,
a social and economic stressor that dictates immigrants’ access to health-promoting services such as public
safety-net programs and affordable health care. We propose to use the California Health Interview Survey
(CHIS), a large, representative health survey of Californian residents that produces valid health estimates by
disaggregated Hispanic/Latino background. We then propose to use data from the Hispanic Community Health
Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) cohort study, where participants completed an extensive set of SES and
stress measures, provided blood samples assayed for DNA methylation age, and completed clinic visits for
objective cardiometabolic health measures. The overarching goal of this proposed research is to evaluate how
immigration status contributes to disparities in cardiometabolic health and accelerated epigenetic aging across
the life course among Hispanic/Latino populations in the U.S. In Aim 1, we will use 2015-2021 CHIS data to
evaluate the associations between immigration status and CVD risk factors and disease among
Hispanic/Latino adults (N~32,000) and adolescents (N~2,000) in California. In Aim 2, we will use HCHS/SOL
Youth data (N=1,200) to estimate the associations between parental immigration status, accelerated
epigenetic aging, and objective cardiometabolic health measures among Hispanic/Latino adolescents. In Aim
3, we will use a sub-sample of HCHS/SOL adult data (N=1,000) to estimate the longitudinal associations
between immigration status, accelerated epigenetic aging, and objective cardiometabolic health measures
across two points over a 6-year period. Upon completion of these aims, we anticipate the impact of this work to
significantly advance our understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in CVD by evaluating differences in CVD
risk by immigration status, estimating the associations between immigration status, epigenetic aging, and
cardiometabolic health, and ultimately informing future cardiovascular public health interventions for
Hispanic/Latino populations. The planned research and training goals contained in this fellowship application
will develop my expertise in epigenetic and epidemiologic methods, will strengthen my professional career
development, and will ultimately foster my long-term goal of becoming an independent academic researcher."

Anthracycline-based chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin (Adriamycin) are among the most widely used
anticancer agents in oncology for the treatment of multiple solid tumors and leukemias. The clinical use of
doxorubicin is associated with a dose-limiting, potentially lethal cardiotoxicity for which no effective
preventative treatments are presently available. In addition, the mechanism by which doxorubicin accumulates
into cardiomyocytes remains to this day unknown. Using a technique based on human induced pluripotent
stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes from cancer patients receiving doxorubicin, we recently found that uptake
transporter OCT3 is highly upregulated in patients experiencing cardiotoxicity. Functional validation studies in
OCT3-deficient mice and heterologous overexpressed models confirmed that doxorubicin is transported into
cardiomyocytes by OCT3. Furthermore, deficiency of OCT3 protected mice from acute and chronic
doxorubicin-related changes in cardiovascular function and genetic pathways associated with cardiac damage,
and these findings were confirmed using cardiac MRI-based methods. To provide proof-of-principle and
demonstrate translational relevance of this transport mechanism, we found that pharmacological targeting of
OCT3 can also preserve cardiovascular function following treatment with doxorubicin without affecting its
plasma levels and its cytotoxic potential against multiple leukemia and breast cancer cell lines. Finally, we
identified a previously unrecognized, OCT3-dependent pathway of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity that
results in a downstream signaling cascade involving the calcium binding proteins S100A8 and S100A9, and we
validated this observation in a mouse model with S100A8 and S100A8 deficiency. Based on these preliminary
findings, we now outline three sets of related studies that will further test and refine the validity of our central
hypothesis that targeted inhibition of OCT3 function can specifically affect accumulation of doxorubicin in
cardiomyocytes and affect downstream toxic events without negatively influencing its plasma pharmacokinetic
profile or antitumor properties: (i) identification, validation, and mechanistic characterization of novel OCT3
inhibitors from a library screen that includes FDA-approved agents in novel humanized knock-in and
conditional knock-out mouse models; (ii) functional validation of endogenous and exogenous cardiac-specific
OCT3 biomarkers that could serve as a companion diagnostic to guide dose selection of OCT3 inhibitors; and
(iii) safety, toxicokinetic, and efficacy analyses of optimized combinatorial regimens of OCT3 inhibitors with
doxorubicin (acute and chronic), including simultaneous assessment of cardiac protection and antitumor
properties in established experimental models of breast cancer and acute leukemias. It is expected that these
studies will shed new light on the etiology of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and provide a rationale for the
future implementation of novel targeted intervention strategies to prevent this debilitating side effect."

The deltaretroviruses represent one of seven genera in the Retroviridae and are recognized as being complex
retroviruses that encode for gag, pol and env along with several important accessory genes. These viruses have
been associated with the development of lymphoid leukemias in humans (i.e., human T-cell leukemia virus,
HTLV) and cattle (i.e., bovine leukemia virus, BLV). Deltaretroviruses are notorious for being difficult to propagate
in cell culture, which has prohibited rigorous analyses of virus replication, including the steps involved in
retrovirus assembly. The detailed steps involved in retrovirus assembly are poorly understood even for the more
tractable systems, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Our preliminary studies have revealed that
the deltaretroviruses have distinct immature and mature particle morphologies compared to other retroviruses,
as well as distinct Gag-Gag and capsid-capsid (CA-CA) lattice structures, which likely impacts virus particle
formation. Furthermore, we have made observations which reveal that HTLV Gag puncta biogenesis is distinct
among retroviruses, relying heavily on Gag recruitment to particle assembly sites by Gag already at the plasma
membrane. This distinctive pathway for particle assembly likely has important implications for establishment of
HTLV particle assembly sites and the dynamics of particle assembly. In this application, we propose to advance
our research in novel directions through innovative state-of-the-art experimental approaches, making use of
comparative retrovirology in order to provide deep insights into the nature of deltaretrovirus particle assembly
and maturation. In particular, we will apply cryo-electron microscopy/tomography (cryo-EM/ET), super-resolution
microscopy, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, and dual-color z-scan microscopy to
investigate the 1) structure-function analysis of deltaretrovirus maturation, 2) deltaretrovirus Gag recruitment and
puncta biogenesis, and 3) analysis of critical steps in deltaretrovirus particle biogenesis. The proposed studies
will extend our preliminary studies and exploit advanced imaging technologies to gain new insights into the
deltaretrovirus particle assembly pathway, which we have demonstrated as being distinct from other retroviruses.
This research will provide foundationally important knowledge regarding the details of virus assembly at the
plasma membrane for enveloped viruses."

 To better diagnose and treat individuals at risk for age-related dementia and cognitive decline, it is
important to understand the differences between normal and pathological changes to the brain and their
different impacts on cognitive function. Furthermore, the presence of different cognitive trajectories across the
normal spectrum of brain aging presents a particularly challenging problem for cognitive science and clinical
treatment efficacy. The objective of this research proposal is to identify age-related changes to brain function
across cognitive trajectories in different types of learning. Although it has been long documented that humans
and other mammalian species exhibit behavioral shifts from ‘place/allocentric’ to ‘response-driven/body-
centered’ spatial navigation strategies in advanced age, it is unclear whether these shifts extend to strategy
use in other cognitive domains outside spatial learning. This response shift has been defined by shifting away
from hippocampus (HPC)-dependent ‘cognitive mapping’ strategies, and toward caudate nucleus/dorsal
striatum-dependent ‘stimulus-response’ strategies. Furthermore, the dorsomedial subregion of the dorsal
striatum (DMS), has been implicated in behavioral flexibility and age-related changes to goal-directed behavior.
These observations suggest overall age-related changes to network communication that reflect the relative
expression of HPC- versus DMS-dominant solutions. This proposal will test the central hypothesis that age-
related changes to learning strategy are a product of suboptimal, perseverative behavior that can manifest as
cognitive impairment in older adults across different behavioral tasks, that this deficit is reflected by altered
HPC-DMS network activity, and that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a critical role in these dynamics.
To achieve the goals of this proposal we will first combine high density in vivo electrophysiology recorded from
the HPC and DMS during associative and spatial learning in young and aged animals. This aim will determine
whether aged impaired or unimpaired animals have differential coupling patterns between the HPC and DMS
compared to young, and in what cognitive contexts these differences arise. Second, we will determine the
contributions of the ACC on spatial learning in young and aged rodents combining neurophysiology, volumetric
mapping of immediate-early gene expression, and circuit manipulation using virally transfected designer
receptors. The findings of this proposal will begin to unravel a more complex view of memory-system
interaction and age-related cognitive decline, which will have implications for therapeutic strategies in treating
dementia and promoting cognitive health."
10837745,"Animals exhibit astonishing diversity in their behavior, yet almost nothing is known about how evolutionary
variation in neural circuits gives rise to species-specific behavioral variation. Here I propose to take advantage
of recent advances in genome editing and develop an innovative approach to reveal how evolution sculpts
brain circuits. Using CRISPR genome editing technology, we are translating neurogenetic tools from D.
melanogaster to other Drosophila species, allowing for the first high-resolution anatomic and functional neural
circuit mapping across species. By directly comparing the homologous sensory processing pathways in closely
related drosophilids, we will precisely pinpoint where adaptive changes have occurred within the nervous
system to produce species-specific mate preferences. The rapid evolution of Drosophila courtship allows us to
systematically probe how parallel changes in behavior have been independently implemented in different
species, shedding light on the types of changes that are permissible and preferable within brain circuits.
Mapping the sites of anatomic and functional change within these pathways will further enable us to study their
underlying molecular basis, using transcriptional profiling of the relevant neural populations to provide a
definitive link between genetic and behavioral variation. Together, the proposed studies will transform our
understanding of the molecular, cellular, and circuit-level changes that generate adaptive behavioral variation
across species. As the etiology of many brain disorders is aberrant neural circuit wiring, a deeper
understanding of the link between genes, neural circuits, and behavior could have profound consequences for
mental health."

Despite major advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, many of the therapies
that target the most well-studied genes and pathways have not achieved universal success in reversing or
even halting disease progression. This, along with the clinical heterogeneity of patients with idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), suggest that consideration of other genes in models of disease pathogenesis may be
useful. Fibroblasts from patients with IPF differ in the expression of many genes compared to normal
fibroblasts, and this laboratory has had a longstanding interest in identifying epigenetic changes that account
for these differences. KCNMB1 codes for the beta subunit of the large conductance (BK, Maxi-K, KCa1.1)
potassium channel and was identified in our previous microarray study as the top differentially methylated gene
in IPF fibroblasts. BK channels modulate potassium current and are well known to be important in vascular
tone and smooth muscle biology, but its importance in fibrosis has never been examined. We recently showed
in a publication that 1) KCNMB1 expression is increased in fibroblasts from IPF patients, 2) KCNMB1
contributes to increased BK channel activity, and 3) increased function of BK channels promote myofibroblast
differentiation, a hallmark of IPF. How it does so and whether this is sufficient to promote or worsen pulmonary
fibrosis in vivo is unknown. The objectives of this grant are to determine the mechanism of how BK channels
contribute to myofibroblast differentiation and establish the importance of BK channels to animal models of
pulmonary fibrosis. Our central hypothesis is that the epigenetic upregulation of KCNMB1 and increased BK
channel activity in IPF fibroblasts contribute to pulmonary fibrosis by promoting calcium signaling in fibroblasts,
which lead to myofibroblast differentiation. The First Aim is to establish the importance of BK channels to the
development of pulmonary fibrosis in vivo, and localize its pathogenic actions to lung fibroblasts. The Second
Aim is to delineate the mechanism by which BK channels contribute to myofibroblast differentiation, with the
hypothesis that BK channels promote intracellular calcium signaling, which is necessary for differentiation into
myofibroblasts. The Third Aim is to determine how expression of KCNMB1 is regulated in lung fibroblasts and
how profibrotic stimuli modulates opening and closing of BK channels. This proposal is significant because it
establishes BK channels as a novel, but important driver in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis.
Accomplishing these aims will also identify a mechanism and role for BK channels in the differentiation of
myofibroblasts that has never been previously described. Ultimately, these studies will serve to identify new
targets for future IPF therapeutics."

Microglia are immune cells that act as the primary rst-responding sentinels in the brain. In response to brain
injury, infection, or disease, microglia rapidly react to attack intruders, remove neuronal debris, and restore home-
ostasis. In addition to their immune role, microglia have been shown to be critical to normal brain development
and function. Although direct comparisons between morphology and function are hard to make, it is clear that
changes in microglial morphology correspond to di erent responses to external stimuli and internal functional
states. Reactive microglia undergo a series of stereotyped morphological changes that grossly correspond to their
di erent immune functions. Additionally, it has been shown that microglial morphology is altered with neuronal
activity, demonstrating that changes in their physiological functions are tied to distinct morphologies, even in the
absence of pathology. Analysis of alterations in microglial morphology can inform studies of neurodevelopment,
neurodegenerative diseases, and the e ects of environmental toxicants on brain function; however, currently we
are unable to ascribed speci c functions to morphological states. Improved methods of processing and analysis
have the potential to remove this critical barrier and allow us to directly link morphological changes with their
corresponding functional consequences.
 Confocal microscopy is used to capture digital images at the spatial resolution necessary to detect the morphol-
ogy of individual microglia. These images are often processed using proprietary commercial software to extract
individual cells. The morphology of these cells is then quantifying using Sholl Analysis, in which concentric circles
are overlaid on the image and the number of microglial branches that intersect the circle at each distance from
the soma are counted. The resulting curves are subsequently analyzed to obtain summary statistics, such as the
maximum number of intersections observed. The majority of these summaries ignore the dependence between
adjacent distances and lack a corresponding measure of uncertainty. Furthermore, current methods discard a
vast amount of information present in both the Sholl curves and, to an even greater degree, in the digital images
themselves. Finally, individual quantitative summaries are typically analyzed separately, ignoring the dependence
between di erent aspects of microglial morphology and thereby reducing statistical power.
 We propose to develop statistical methods to model microglial morphology that fully leverage the wealth
of information present in the imaging data and provide interpretable parameter estimates and corresponding
measures of uncertainty. The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop statistical methodology that will
lead to improved analysis of microglial images and uncover the changes in morphology that are most predictive of
alterations in microglial function."

upon the Institute for Protein Design’s extensive infrastructure for protein production and characterization,
using measurements of yield, thermostability, and antigenicity to map the strengths and limitations of different
computational design approaches and refine design strategies. Serological and structural characterization of
sera from immunized mice at the UW, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, and UTMB will identify constructs that
elicit potent neutralizing antibody responses. To rigorously evaluate these constructs and distinguish lead
candidates, we will leverage small animal challenge models being developed by UTMB to identify constructs
that confer effective protection."

computational results, high-throughput sequencing data, and experimental data. Our main in silico data are
design models of new proteins, comprising models of the designed protein structures, their amino acid
sequences, and associated scores and metrics. Experimental data include negative-stain and cryo electron
microscopy images; x-ray diffraction images; atomic coordinates of determined protein structures;
deep-sequencing reads and their interpretation; and various wet lab assay results in spreadsheets-like formats.
We will follow the industry-standard and NIH-mandated security practices to manage access to the systems we
operate and all data backups, and the NIH FAIR data sharing principles to annotate newly generated data and
make it available to others. We will distribute our computational methods as free open-source software on
GitHub to make our analyses reproducible and accelerate biological research worldwide. Furthermore, we will
expand and maintain our on-site high-performance computing resources to add storage capacity for the data
we generate and computational capacity for data processing. In addition, we will manage user access to those
resources and provide training on best-use practices of the resources operated by this Core."

 Epidemiological data have established an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease events in
obese individuals, with these events being strongly associated with excessive arterial stiffness. Elevated
aldosterone levels and activation of vascular mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) contribute to obesity related
arterial stiffening. Studies by our group and others have further shown that enhanced endothelial cell (EC)
mineralocorticoid receptor (ECMR) and its downstream epithelial sodium channel (EnNaC) signaling, induce
arterial and EC stiffening together with oxidative stress and inflammation. Conversely, ECMR/EnNaC deletion
prevents diet or aldosterone induced excessive endothelial and arterial stiffness. Our recent data further
indicate that activation of the ECMR increases expression of EC deubiquitinating enzymes and that endothelial
ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (ECUSP8) plays a dominant role in preventing EnNaC ubiquitination and
degradation, leading to increases in EC endosomal EnNaC. Moreover, enhanced ECMR/ECUSP8 signaling
also promotes endosomal EnNaC trafficking and release of exosomal EnNaC. Importantly, exosomal EnNaC,
released from endosomes, is re-uptaken and in turn impacts on EC/vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) and
arterial stiffening. Our research hypothesis is that ECMR activation enhances ECUSP8 signaling that increases
endosomal EnNaC, endosome trafficking, plasma membrane EnNaC, and release of exosomal EnNaC,
resulting in EC/VSMC and arterial stiffening. This notion is supported by the fact that obesity is a major public
health issue in the United States, and it is associated with cardiovascular MR activation and vascular disease.
To address this hypothesis in vivo and in vitro, models of ECMR/ECUSP8/EnNaC activation will include a high
fat, high sucrose diet (diet induced obesity) and aldosterone administration, respectively. A cross-sectional
human study will be included to investigate the correlation between plasma exosomal EnNaC and arterial
stiffening in clinically obese and hypertensive patients. Aim 1 of this application proposes to determine whether
ECMR activation enhances ECUSP8 signaling that increases endosomal EnNaC, endosome trafficking,
plasma membrane EnNaC content, and EC and arterial stiffening. Aim 2 will determine determine whether
ECUSP8 signaling increases release of EC derived exosomal EnNaC that is uptaken by ECs/VSMCs and in
turn impacts on arterial stiffening. The proposed innovative research program will provide enhanced
understanding of the interactions between ECMR/ECUSP8/EnNaC activation, endosome trafficking, release of
exosmes, and identify novel therapeutic targets and strategies for the early diagnosis and prevention of obesity
induced vascular stiffening and related cardiovascular complications."
10852672,"Primaquine and tafenoquine are the only approved drugs that can eliminate plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) infection
from its liver phase (i.e. radical cure). However, both primaquine and tafenoquine are contraindicated in patients
with a glucose-6-phosophate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd) because they can cause potentially life-
threatening hemolytic anemia. Approximately half a billion humans have some form of G6PDd and they are
concentrated in malaria endemic regions. As a result, there is no cure available for the approximately 1 million
G6PDd humans infected with P. vivax. NAPDH (and to a lesser extent NADH) fuel anti-oxidation pathways as
electron donors. Primaquine metabolites (PMs) generate toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) by a redox cycling
reaction wherein PMs receives an electron (from NADPH or NADH) to generate a PM radical, which in turn
donates its electron to oxygen to generate superoxide. The transfer of electrons (from NADPH or NADH) to PMs
requires an enzymatic reductase – however, the reductase has never been identified. Herein we present the
novel finding that the enzymes NQO1 and NQO2 both transfer electrons to PMs and drive superoxide generation.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first identification of reductases in RBCs that participate in and may be
required for ROS generation by PMs. The data generated thus far are largely in vitro. The next necessary step
is in vivo studies, which are the focus of this grant. NQO1 and NQO2 have widespread effects in multiple organs
and drug metabolism by the liver. Accordingly, to allow testing of hypotheses focused on RBCs, we generated
two novel mouse strains with floxed exons either NQO1 or NQO2 (i.e. conditional knockouts). RBC specific
knockouts will be generated by crossing these animals with erythroid specific CRE transgenic mice. We have
also generated humanized G6PDd mice that undergo primaquine induced hemolysis. Combining these tools,
we propose three hypothesis driven specific aims to investigate the mechanistic roles of NQO1 (Specific Aim
1) or NQO2 (Specific Aim 2) in primaquine induced hemolysis in humanized G6PDd mice. A third specific aim
(Specific Aim 3) investigates joint effects of NQO1 and NQO2, addressing issues of potential redundant
pathways. The proposed aims will use both in vitro and in vivo systems to test the roles of NQO1 or NQO2 in
driving PM dependent generation of superoxide, cellular and biochemical damage, and in vivo hemolysis of
G6PDd RBCs. The studies are designed to drive both basic discovery and also translational approaches, as
NQO1 and/or NQO2 inhibitors may decrease primaquine induced hemolysis in G6PDd RBCs. Further
translation is found in that NQO2 is unique in its use of dihydronicotinamide riboside (NRH) as an electron donor.
NRH is part of the vitamin B3 complex and is largely derived from diet. It is well known that within patients with
the same G6PD variant, some patients briskly hemolyze when taking primaquine while others do not, with limited
ability to predict toxicity on a patient-by-patient basis. The use of NRH by NQO2 supports the novel hypothesis
that variability in primaquine toxicity is affected by nutritional status."
10852772,"Background and Significance: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) impacts both individual and relationship
functioning. In romantic relationships, PTSD can impact both partners, causing disruption within the relationship
that can in turn worsen PTSD symptomology. Poor relationship functioning places Veterans at greater risk for
other negative outcomes such as suicide, homelessness and substance use disorders. Veterans seeking
treatment for PTSD often want to improve their intimate relationships and express the desire to involve close
others in treatment. Treatment outcomes are in fact enhanced when both partners engage in treatment together.
One treatment option for Veterans and their partners is brief Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy (bCBCT), a
trauma focused 8-session psychotherapy for PTSD that is delivered in a dyadic format to an individual with PTSD
and a loved one—typically an intimate partner. This intervention has been rolled out in the VA and is consistently
efficacious in improving PTSD, however the effects of bCBCT on relationship functioning are less robust with
small effect sizes, especially among Veterans. Novel pharmacological augmentation strategies that
simultaneously target mechanisms of PTSD and relationship functioning may increase the potency and impact
of bCBCT. Intranasal oxytocin is one such novel agent, as it influences multiple processes relevant to PTSD
recovery, such as fear extinction, and relationship functioning, including but not limited to trust, empathy, and
positive communication. Intranasal oxytocin is therefore ideally suited to enhance the effects of bCBCT. The
goal of this proposal is to examine the efficacy of bCBCT augmented with intranasal oxytocin for improving
Veterans' PTSD symptoms and relationship satisfaction among both Veterans and their intimate partners. It is
hypothesized that the bCBCT + oxytocin condition will outperform bCBCT + placebo with respect to Veterans'
PTSD symptoms and both Veterans' and partners' relationship satisfaction. Additionally, this study will explore
the impact of intranasal oxytocin on Veterans' psychosocial functioning and potential mechanisms of action (i.e.,
communication skills, empathy, and trust).
Methods: This study will recruit 120 couples from the VA San Diego Healthcare System for a placebo-controlled
four-year randomized clinical trial. Eligible couples will consist of a Veteran with PTSD and the Veteran's intimate
partner. Veterans will self-administer 40 international units of intranasal oxytocin (n = 60 dyads) or placebo (n =
60 dyads) 30 minutes before each of the 8 bCBCT sessions. PTSD, relationship satisfaction, psychosocial
functioning, and potential mechanisms of action (communication skills, empathy, and trust) will be assessed at
baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up.
Impacts on Veteran Health Care: This proposal directly addresses the VA priority of advancing innovations in
VHA health care, as well as
the need for interventions that bridge the knowledge-translation gap between existing
evidence-based treatments and increasing their efficacy for Veterans.
Results of the proposed evaluation would
contribute to the VA directive of providing family-based care to all Veterans, as well as address the VA priority
of advancing innovations in healthcare. This investigation of bCBCT augmented with intranasal oxytocin could
yield immediate clinical impact and greatly enhance the delivery of evidence-based care for Veterans and their
partners."

The endogenous tissue regeneration after traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is limited due to an inhibitory
environment by secondary biological events including inflammatory responses. These events result in neural cell
death and demyelination leading to various inflammation-mediated disorders. The long-term goal of this study is
to develop effective acute intervention strategies that limit secondary injuries, thereby creating a permissive
environment that supports regeneration. To achieve this goal, polymer based-nanoparticle (NP) formulations will
be employed to reprogram the circulating innate cells in the blood after trauma. The scientific premise of the
proposed research is based on preliminary data demonstrating that intravenously administered NPs target the
pro-inflammatory sub-set of immune cells prior to extravasation to the injury and reprogram their trafficking
patterns and phenotypes that limit inflammation and additional tissue damage, thereby inducing enhanced
regeneration. Particularly, the immunomodulation is mediated by the physicochemical properties of NPs,
indicating that NPs functions can be engineered differently to influence immune trafficking and phenotypes. The
proposed engineered-NP formulations differentially reprogram innate cells, specifically immunomodulatory
effects of NPs are sex-dependent and, importantly, these effects are solely mediated by distinctive
physicochemical properties of NPs without the active biologics that can cause unfavorable off-target effects. In
this proposal, key physicochemical parameters of NP formulations will be identified for effective
immunomodulation in males and females respectively since the differences in physiological factors between
sexes play a critical role in inflammation after spinal trauma. Aim 1 will focus on interactions between different
NP formulations and innate cells in circulation to identify more effective NP design factors that limit inflammation
in both sexes. Distinct physicochemical properties of NPs will differently affect innate cells trafficking and
phenotype, which will be sex-dependent and subsequently, reprogram an inhibitory environment. NP-induced
differential cellular internalization, phenotype, activation, pharmacokinetic profiles as well as biodistribution of
NPs will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the long-term impacts of NPs on anatomical and functional
regeneration after SCI with a more focused set of NP formulations based on Aim 1. Initially, NP-associated
immune cells will be investigated, then the extent of axonal regrowth and remyelination, synaptogenesis, and
functional recovery in the chronic phase of SCI will be assessed. Collectively, the proposed studies will have the
potential to be a transformational therapy by identifying the relationship between physicochemical parameters
and immune modulation for effective NP formulations to support regeneration. Notably, NPs are made of FDAapproved
polymeric biomaterial enabling them to be readily stored for immediate administration non-invasively
as a means to modulate the innate immune system for functional enhancement."
10847073,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
When a replication fork encounters a DNA lesion in a template strand, replication gives way to DNA repair
and recombination. These encounters define an interface in DNA metabolism that can give rise to genome
instability. This is ultimately manifested in tumor evolution in eukaryotes and the development of antibiotic
resistance and increased pathogenicity in bacteria. In this renewal application, we are investigating perhaps
the most enigmatic of repair processes, the repair of lesion-containing post-replication gaps. When a replisome
encounters a template lesion, disengages, and then re-initiates upstream, the lesion is left behind in a post-
replication gap. The existence of these gaps has been appreciated for over 5 decades, but progress has been
limited by methodology that has been inadequate to properly explore their general importance and repair.
These gaps are primary substrates for DNA synthesis by translesion DNA polymerases, recombinational DNA
repair, and replicational template switching, all processes linked with genomic instability.
 Work in the last funding period has featured the development of a range of essential new methods, as
well as conceptual advances in our understanding of how post-replication gaps are generated and processed.
In E. coli, we now know that post-replication gaps are generated several times each replication cycle and that
gap formation is triggered by encounters with bulky nucleotide lesions. We have laid out the pathways by
which the gaps are targeted and resolved by particular DNA repair proteins. We are now in a position to
provide a deep molecular understanding of these pathways. As a bonus, we have identified four potential
bacterial vulnerabilities that may eventually provide pharmaceutical advances to treat antibiotic-resistand
pathogens or slow the development of antibiotic resistance.
 We bring together world-class expertise in biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, and biophysics.
We will apply our new methods, including novel single-molecule approaches, towards detecting and
quantifying gaps and further characterize the proteins acting on them. While driven by our mechanistic
questions, the new methods will broadly benefit research in genomic maintenance.
 The six specific aims constitute a systematic attack on the problem. Aims 1-3 focus on the
recombinational DNA repair of post-replication gaps by the RecFOR system. Aim 4 is an exploration of the
single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) and how it directs the division of labor in gaps via its interactions
with 20 or more different repair proteins. Aim 5 focuses on the gap-related activation of the mutagenic DNA
polymerase V and its homologues, the source of most mutagenesis in any bacterial cell. Finally, aim 6
investigate an entirely new biological phenomenon, the presence of DNA sequence elements in the bacterial
genome that force the formation of post-replication gaps in particular locations."

Understanding the interconnected web of brain circuits that regulate body weight (fat) is vital for the prevention
and treatment of obesity. The goal of this proposal is to establish a novel role for the cerebellum in feeding
behaviors related to obesity. The vast computational power of the cerebellum (>1/2 of all neurons in the human
brain are cerebellar granule cells) has traditionally been considered in relation to movement. However, mounting
evidence suggests that cerebellar machinery for learning and predictive control operates across a much wider
domain: ranging from autonomic functions to cognitive and motivated behaviors. Guided by our recent finding of
a specific region of the mouse cerebellum that potently drives ingestive behavior, the proposed experiments
leverage state-of-the-art methods for mapping, monitoring, and manipulating neural circuits in mice to elucidate
cerebellar roles in feeding behavior. The proposed studies will lay the groundwork for imputing a vital role of the
cerebellum in optimizing feeding behaviors in the context of extant physiological and environmental conditions."

The University of Wisconsin’s (UW) Computation and Informatics in Biology and Medicine (CIBM) training
program is proposing to continue training the next generation of scientists with deep and broad expertise in
biomedical informatics and data science. We will continue our collaboration with the Marshfield Clinical
Research Institute (MCRI) as a partner in the training grant, and we will enable our trainees to develop their
expertise and establish the foundations of their careers within a vibrant ecosystem of biomedical and data
science research at UW and MCRI.
We will continue our focus on providing trainees with (1) a strong algorithmic and quantitative foundation from

predoctoral positions for research in biomedical informatics and data science addressing HIV infection, and 4
short-term trainee positions.
The CIBM program is well positioned to serve the country with highly trained researchers who have significant

Constitutively increased intracellular pH (pHi) is common to most cancers regardless of tissue
origin or genetic background. Increased pHi is sufficient to induce oncogenic phenotypes,
including dysregulated tissue growth, dysplasia, and invasive cell migration. pH-regulated cell
behaviors are mediated by changes in the protonation state of pH sensitive proteins, termed pH
sensors. At the molecular level, changes in pHi can alter the protonation state of amino acid
residues with pKa values near neutral, which can markedly affect protein conformation and
function. By changing the protonation of multiple proteins in unison, pHi dynamics can coordinate
complex cell processes. Although understudied, emerging evidence suggests that increased pHi
contributes to tumorigenesis.
In this proposal, we will explore how increased pHi regulates the proto-oncogene Myc, and
determine how autophagic cell death is enhanced under these conditions. Aim 1 will explore pH
dependent regulation of Myc. Over-expression of Myc rescues the size and patterning errors
induced by increased pHi, suggesting decreased Myc abundance or activity. We will identify the
domains in Myc protein that mediate pH-sensitivity, and the effects of increased pHi on Myc
function. We will explore transcriptional effects of increased pHi to determine affected pathways
and molecules. Aim 2 will determine regulation of autophagy at increased pHi. We will test if Myc
directly regulates autophagy in Drosophila tissues using established molecular markers. We will
develop our clonal mammalian cell system to test whether increased autophagy at increased pHi
is conserved, and identify affected proteins. Finally, we will measure autophagic flux in tumors
with dysregulated pHi to test the hypothesis that increased pHi promotes tumor growth via
recycling of cellular building blocks generated by autophagy.
Using our established methods in the genetic model organism Drosophila and in clonal
mammalian cells, we bridge scales from tissue-level phenotypic analyses to individual pH-
sensitive proteins that regulate cancer cell behaviors. Significant outcomes from our studies
include new insights on how pH-regulated cellular behaviors enable tumorigenesis. Our strengths
and experience linking tissue-level phenotypes to individual pH-sensitive molecules permit unique
insights in this under-studied area of biology. Insights into the molecular mechanisms of pH-
sensitive proteins may inform therapeutic approaches to limit tumorigenesis."

PROJECT SUMMARY
 This proposal will combine the strengths of experimental mouse model with human prospective birth cohort
study and transdisciplinary expertise to test novel hypotheses that functional RNA methylation (coupled with
DNA methylation) may be one of the mechanisms underlying the association between maternal folate status and
child risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The role of maternal folate status in child risk of ASD has received
great attention and is in debate. While many studies suggest beneficial effect of higher maternal folate intake
against autism, a few studies raised concern about the potential harm of high prenatal folate intake. In the Boston
Birth Cohort (BBC), PI's group demonstrated a wide variation of maternal folate levels, ranging from insufficiency
to excess, which is consistent with the finding in NHANES, a U.S. nationally representative sample. A `U shaped'
relationship was found between frequency of maternal multivitamin supplementation and ASD risk; this
association was further supported by the findings based on measured maternal plasma folate levels.
Furthermore, the preliminary data from PI's group suggest that maternal folate intake may have an impact on
RNA methylation metabolism. Two specific aims were proposed: Aim1 will determine folate-associated
alterations in RNA methylation and RNA/DNA methylation dynamics using mouse neural stem cells (NSCs).
RNA/DNA methylation profiles will be determined using transcriptome-wide and genome-wide bisulfite
sequencing, protein translation will be determined using polysome profiling, and folate-associated alterations in
NSC proliferation and differentiation will be characterized. In-utero folate exposure-associated RNA/DNA
methylation alterations will be determined using a mouse model. Aim 2 will determine RNA methylation sites
associated with in-utero folate exposure in cord blood samples. The inter-relationship of prenatal folate status,
RNA/DNA methylation, and child risk of ASD will be determined via the integration of individual clinical features
with corresponding RNA methylation and DNA methylation information. This proposed study, if successful, will
provide new insight on how environmental exposures (here folate is used as an example) are involved in the
functional activities of RNA modifications and RNA/DNA methylation dynamics, which in turn, may be associated
with adverse health outcomes (here ASD is used as an example). The methodologies developed will be helpful
to investigate molecular underpinnings of other micronutrients or toxicants on other health outcomes."
10850200,"Abstract
Reward-related brain function is consistently linked to greater motivation, pleasure, and goal-directed behavior
and lower risk for depression across the lifespan. Healthy neural reward response supports socioemotional
development, particularly during the preschool years as self-regulatory skills and child reward-related brain
function are rapidly developing in the context of the caregiving environment. Maternal socialization of positive
emotion is one important influence on early reward circuitry development. Mothers with depression are more
likely to discourage (and less likely to encourage) child positive emotions compared to healthy mothers, which
may contribute to early neural reward alterations in their children. Characterizing mechanisms of influence of
maternal socialization on child neural reward response and positive emotion during the preschool years is a
critical window of opportunity when parents have a large influence on child socioemotional development.
Importantly, maternal behavior is amenable to change by training parents on emotion coaching, and these
maternal behavior changes may result in direct and immediate changes in child neural reward function. Thus,
the overarching aim of this proposal is to use a mechanistic trial design to experimentally test the hypothesis
that maternal encouragement of child positive emotion will lead to in-vivo increases in child neural reward
response. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are uniquely suited to non-invasively assess in-vivo, fast-occurring
changes in child reward response during parent-child interactions, including reward positivity (RewP), and the
late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes. Toward this aim, we will randomize 180 mothers with clinically
significant depression symptoms and their 4- to 6-year-old children (50% female) to receive either 3 control
sessions or 3 positive emotion coaching modules from the Parent-Child Interaction Therapy-Emotion
Development (PCIT-ED, which trains mothers on how to encourage positive emotion in their young children.
Children will complete reward tasks at pre- and post-coaching, while neural reward response is assessed via
ERP (RewP and LPP) with their mothers present allowing for in-vivo assessment of maternal behavior. At both
timepoints, we will assess child neural reward response and mothers’ self-reported maternal socialization
behaviors. Understanding how disrupted neural reward responding develops in the preschool years is critical
for the promotion of child emotional wellness and can be directly used to develop preventive interventions
tailored to preschool age children at familial risk for depression."
10850285,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Mirtrons are a new class of small RNAs. Previous findings show mirtrons are generated by splicing and
are less stable than canonical miRNAs. Thus, the expression of mirtrons is often negligible. Additionally, most
mirtrons exhibit distinct evolutionary properties relative to solo and mammals have way more mirtrons than lower
organisms suggesting some unknown importance of mirtrons in mammals. Recently, elevation of mirtrons has
been linked to human cancers and immune disorders. However, the biological significance of mirtrons in humans
is not well understood due to very limited efforts of mirtron research in humans. It is therefore important to
investigate how biogenesis of mirtrons is stabilized during disease development and how increased mirtron
expression promotes tumor/disease progression.
 In ongoing experiments, we show most mirtrons elevated in human cancers contain guanine rich
sequence that forms G-quadruplex, a secondary structure that has been implicated as a strategy adopted by
some RNA viruses to evade the host exoribonucleases, XRN1/2 mediated digestion. We also show XRN/1/2 are
crucial enzymes for mirtron stability that mirtrons in cancer cells significantly increase when XRN1/2 are knocked
down. Additionally, all cancer mirtrons are featured with many (long) terminal nucleotide additions which result
in abundance of mirtrons present in the cancer derived exosomes. Furthermore, we also show mirtrons from the
cancer derived exosomes bind to the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) of macrophages suggesting mirtrons
are novel ligands of TLR7 and potentially modulate immune responses.
 Given these findings, we hypothesize that cancer cells selectively express mirtrons exhibiting high
guanine contents that could form G-quadruplex structure to bypass XRN1/2 mediated degradation. The
nucleotide addition to the 3’ tail provides preferential sorting of mirtrons into exosomes. Cancer exosomes can
be taken by immune cells through endocytosis providing the opportunity for mirtrons to bind to TLR7. The binding
of mirtron to TLR7 serves as an allosteric inhibitor to block TLR7 signaling and the associated downstream
immunological responses. These hypotheses will be addressed in the experiments of the following Specific Aims:
(1) to determine the impact of G-quadruplex structure of mirtrons on the resistance to exoribonucleases, XRN1/2;
(2) to determine the consequence of altered mirtron precursor tailing on exosomal sorting; and (3) to evaluate
the immune modulatory role of cancer mirtrons through binding to TLR7. Should this exploratory study reveal
novel mechanisms of cancer mirtron stabilization and sorting into exosomes, and should these cancer mirtrons
negatively regulate the TLR7 signaling and the related immune functions, novel therapeutics aimed to destabilize
mirtron, to prevent their sorting into exosomes, and/or to compete mirtron binding to TLR7 may provide benefits
to cancer treatment in addition to advance current knowledge of mirtrons in humans."

PROJECT SUMMARY
High-throughput single-cell, spatial, and immune-cell -omic profiling technologies provide a wealth of data to
interrogate basic biological processes, changes in cellular processes, and the molecular basis of disease. When
combined with genomic data science, these fields are opening new frontiers in biology. Phase 1 established the
Center for Quantitative Biology (CQB) with the goal to support and enhance NIH-funded quantitative biological
research at Dartmouth and to facilitate integration of single-cell -omic technologies with cutting-edge
computational methods. The success of the CQB in Phase 1 is highlighted by the graduation of four Research
Project Leaders (RPLs), the onboarding of four new RPLs, and the hiring of seven new tenure-track faculty in
CQB focus areas. The IDeA program investment in CQB RPLs and research cores returned >$60 million in total
external funding, leveraging NIH funds 5:1. Phase 2 will build on the successes of Phase 1 by mentoring the
next generation of CQB COBRE RPLs, continuing growth of research cores, and enabling scientists to engage
in cutting-edge scientific inquiry. The CQB will continue to draw upon faculty from Dartmouth’s Geisel School of
Medicine, the Thayer School of Engineering, Arts & Sciences, and Dartmouth Health. Through its emphasis on
next-generation data, the CQB will synergize genomic data science with ongoing experimental genomic
initiatives across campus, a goal accomplished via four specific areas: 1) Enhance the research competitiveness
of junior faculty in genomic data science and experimental genomics by providing a research environment that
supports and enhances their projects. 2) Expand the breadth and impact of research from NIH-funded
quantitative biologists at Dartmouth by: (a) continuing to recruit talented quantitative biology faculty; (b)
mentoring junior quantitative biologists; and (c) providing systems for translating single-cell dynamics to
applications in human disease. 3) Develop, maintain, and leverage key shared resources to support faculty in
the CQB, at Dartmouth, and in the IDeA community by growing the Single-Cell Genomics and Genomic Data
Science Cores. 4) Create synergistic interactions between the dry-lab computational scientist and traditional
experimental scientist to promote cross-talk, collaboration, and integrative analyses between the disciplines.
Dartmouth continues to make a substantial institutional commitment to the success and long-term sustainability
of the CQB, including the commitment to hiring five new tenure-track faculty. Institutional program enrichment
funds will support research infrastructure, scientific exchange, and a pilot project program to foster a vibrant
intellectual community, recruit new project leaders, and enhance the impact and funding competitiveness of all
CQB members. With experienced leadership, efficient administrative structures, and a compelling vision, CQB
has demonstrated a paradigm that interweaves computational and experimental early-stage translational
research, allowing the CQB to grow its portfolio of extramurally-funded investigators and thrive as a nationally-
recognized Center of Biomedical Research Excellence."

SPECIFIC AIMS. The next-generation sequencing (NGS) revolution has generated massive amounts of new
data that have transformed the field of genomics. Furthermore, development of new and existing genomics
technologies continues to increase throughput of existing platforms while also giving rise to novel data types that
measure an ever-growing list of genomic modalities1. Bioinformatic, computational, and statistical analysis
approaches are critical for extraction of meaningful biological insights from the highly dimensional datasets
generated by NGS technologies. Application of complex bioinformatics approaches has played a central role in
recent scientific milestones, such as the completion and closure of the entire human genome sequence2, and
rapid assembly of the Sars-CoV-2 genome during the COVID-19 pandemic3. Interdisciplinary frameworks that
forge collaboration between quantitative and experimental researchers are required to maintain continued
discovery in the genomic era.
The field of single-cell genomics has recently seen intense and rapid development of novel technologies that
have provided deeper insights into a vast array of biological processes4. These technologies have continued to
increase not only the number of cells examined in a single experiment but also the number of genomic modalities
that can be measured simultaneously. For example, integration of genomic and microscopic technologies has
spawned the field of spatial transcriptomics, which enables spatial analysis of genome-wide gene expression at
single cell-resolution5. However, the promise of these technologies requires the concurrent development of
computational methodologies that can draw robust and efficient insights from these unique data. Development
of novel approaches for specific single-cell applications is an active area of research, with a constant stream of
new methods becoming available to the research community. However, leveraging these methods to make
relevant insights requires teams of bioinformaticians, computational biologists, and quantitative methodologists
who have diverse interdisciplinary backgrounds in genomics, statistics, data science, and computing.
In Phase 1, the Data Analytics Core (renamed herein for Phase 2 as the Genomics Data Sciences Core, GDSC)
developed a dynamic and interactive core facility that met the unique analytical needs of its wide user base. In
Phase 2, we will build on the established services from Phase 1 to serve the new research project leads (RPLs)
as well as those of the wider Dartmouth research community. Specifically, we will develop and incorporate
analysis pipelines for spatial transcriptomics into our analysis portfolio to support the investment in cutting-edge
instrumentation made by the Single-Cell Genomics Core (SCGC). In addition, we will continue to innovate and
incorporate data analysis solutions for other emerging genomics technologies such as long-read sequencing
applications. Furthermore, we will build on our series of nationally recognized online genomic data science
workshops, experiences that train participants in fundamental concepts of practical genomic data analysis, to
include analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data. Collectively, these efforts will allow us to support our
extensive user base amassed in Phase 1, while further developing a fee structure that prepares us for future
sustainability into Phase 3 and beyond. These services harmonize with the analytic needs of new project leads,
the larger Dartmouth and IDeA communities, and the ever-expanding technologies available in the SCGC.
Specific Aim 1. To support the development and implementation of novel approaches for analysis of
-omics data. We will leverage our experience applying cutting-edge genomic data analysis techniques to
support the development and implementation of novel analysis methods to analyze bulk, single-cell, and spatial
genomics research at Dartmouth and elsewhere. GDSC personnel will stay abreast of the latest advances in
analytical developments to facilitate implementation of such state-of-the-art methodologies. Where relevant, we
will also develop resources and training materials that facilitate the dissemination and utilization of new analysis
methods and genomics datasets created by project leads.
Specific Aim 2. To support cluster computing, pipeline development, and access to biological databases
for COBRE Center Project Leaders, mentors, Dartmouth, and the wider IDeA community. We will further
develop computational resources that support cluster computing for multidisciplinary genomics research among
a wide range of investigators at Dartmouth. These resources will include the development and maintenance of
existing and novel standardized data analysis pipelines, aggregation, and hosting of valuable genomics
reference datasets on the Dartmouth computing infrastructure, as well as development of new educational
materials for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data analysis.
This core will continue to serve all the proposed COBRE research projects while remaining highly integrated with
the SCGC. Such integration will be critical in Phase 2 to ensure that experimental design meets requirements
for analytical procedures; this is critical given the complexity of both the novel instrumentation and experimental
designs of the proposed projects. Combined with our expanding educational resources, GDSC will have a
substantial and durable positive impact on the quality of biomedical research at Dartmouth and beyond."
10852730,"Cellular and molecular functions in hormonally-controlled tissues like the uterus are coordinately
controlled by both the endocrine system and the immune system. Immune cells of the female reproductive
tract (FRT) must maintain a microenvironment that is permissible to fertilization but resistant to foreign pathogens
and infection, resulting in a complex milieu of cell types and states. Cyclic changes in steroid sex hormone levels
within the FRT across the menstrual cycle, coupled with heterogeneous physical compartments, necessitate a
systems-level approach to evaluating the fates and functions of these cells. To date, epithelial and stromal
responses to hormones in reproductive tissues like the uterus have been well-characterized, but there is a gap
in our understanding of how immune cells are impacted, including macrophages (MØs). MØs perform diverse
functions in immune defense and tissue maintenance. These cells are also highly responsive to their
environment, and rapidly adapt to shifting tissue milieus. In this regard, MØs are important in the pathology of
endometriosis, a prevalent, painful, and hormone-dependent uterine disease in which endometrial-like tissue
grows outside of the uterus. The long-term goal of the Research Project Leader’s lab is to delineate the
role of sex hormones in modulating MØ functions to better understand their role in health and disease.
This project will specifically address this outstanding knowledge gap by employing a systems-biology approach
to characterize the impact of sex hormones on macrophage fates and functions. First, the team will deeply profile
how sex hormones impact MØ differentiation and response to immune stimuli (Aim 1). They will then use
longitudinal single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin followed
by sequencing (scATAC-seq) to fully map the transcriptional and regulatory impact of sex hormones on MØ
activation and differentiation. Second, the team will use spatial transcriptomics to identify ligands and receptors
that drive key MØ interactions in healthy and endometriotic tissues (Aim 2). This proposed Research Project
will advance the Leader’s research goals and independent career significantly by allowing her to
generate foundational and comprehensive datasets to determine how sex hormones alter MØ
differentiation and activation. This COBRE and its Single-Cell Genomics Core and Genomic Data Science
Core will allow the Project Leader to begin building a systems-level understanding of the cellular programs that
are modified by sex hormones to drive specialized MØ fates and functions. This research has practical
implications for understanding the diverse roles of MØ populations in hormonally-controlled tissues in
pregnancy, menstruation, and disease and will enable approaches for designing macrophage-targeted
therapeutics for reproductive tissue diseases."
10853087,"Project Summary
Double-hit lymphoma (DHL) and double-expressing lymphoma (DEL) are aggressive subtypes of diffuse large
B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that are characterized by translocations or amplifications of both MYC and BCL2
oncogenes, or that co-overexpress MYC and BCL2 oncoproteins, respectively. MYC and BCL2 drive cancer cell
growth and metabolism, or confer a marked resistance to apoptosis, respectively. Accordingly, patients with DHL
or DEL respond poorly to chemotherapy and targeted therapies, and currently lack effective treatment options;
indeed DHL and DEL are currently considered incurable. Thus, there is an urgent need to define new
therapeutically tractable vulnerabilities for the treatment of DHL and DEL. Recently, we modeled DHL using a
platform that includes bone marrow stroma and that mimics the DHL tumor microenvironment. Using this platform
we implemented unbiased activity-based proteomic profiling, drug screens, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq studies to
identify essential pathways and targets that are manifest in DHL. Quite strikingly, these analyses revealed that
DHL have a unique super-enhancer (SE) landscape, where SE manifest in DHL are associated with genes that
control the lymphoma cell fate or oncogenic signaling. Further, these screens revealed that DHL and DEL cell
lines and primary patient specimens are highly sensitive to inhibitors of the general transcription apparatus. In
particular, all DHL and DEL cells are exquisitely sensitive to THZ1, a newly identified covalent inhibitor of cyclin-
dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) that functions as a transcriptional co-factor and that phosphorylates the C-terminal
domain of RNA polymerase-II. Furthermore, our studies with a selective inhibitor of CDK9 coined NVP2 revealed
that DHL and DEL cells survival also requires the activity of this kinase, which regulates transcriptional
elongation. Notably our new findings have established that both CDK7 and CDK90 function are essential to
maintain MYC expression in models of DHL and DEL. We hypothesize that MYC-, CDK7- and CDK9-
dependent transcription and BCL-2 overexpression cooperatively drive the aggressive phenotypes of
DHL and DEL and, accordingly, that combined inhibition of CDK7 or CDK9 and BCL-2 triggers synthetic
lethality in these aggressive lymphomas. Using our cell-based platform, DHL and DEL cell line models, DHL
patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and a syngeneic mouse DHL model that are available in our laboratories, our
respective expertise, and our unique access to large numbers of primary DHL patient specimens, we will address
the role of CDK7 and CDK9 in the maintenance of DHL, and we will define the mechanism by which CDK7/CDK9
sustains the expression of oncogenic drivers in this lethal malignancy. Finally, we will strategically target the
transcriptional machinery and pre-clinically validate a therapeutic strategy that combines drugs that disable
CDK7, CDK9 and BCL2 as a synthetic therapeutic approach to treat DHL and DEL. !"
10831552,"Disturbed sleep places older adults at higher risk for frailty, morbidity, and even mortality. Yet nursing home
(NH) routines frequently disturb residents’ sleep through use of noise and light or efforts, for example, to
reduce incontinence. NH residents with Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias (ADRD)—almost two-thirds
of long-stay NH residents—are likely to be particularly affected by sleep disturbance. This study tackles these
important issues and substantially moves forward goals of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease
2018 Update by proposing to implement an evidence-based intervention to improve sleep: a NH frontline staff
huddling program known as LOCK. The LOCK program is derived from evidence supporting strengths-based
learning, systematic observation, relationship-based teamwork, and efficiency. A LOCK program pilot targeting
staff-resident interactions enabled 6 Veterans Health Administration (VA) NHs make meaningful quantitative
and qualitative improvements. Preliminary qualitative data from a national VA roll out show that the program is
effective when targeting resident clinical outcomes such as pain and pressure ulcers. The program’s methods
have also improved clinical care in non-VA NHs. This proposal is therefore an NIH Stage III, real world hybrid
efficacy-effectiveness pragmatic trial of the LOCK program for sleep (LOCK sleep program). In non-VA NHs
from 3 NH corporations, the study will (1) refine the LOCK program to focus on sleep for residents with ADRD
in an R61 phase, (2) test the impact of the LOCK sleep program for NH residents with ADRD in an R33 phase,
and (3) evaluate the program’s sustainability. The R61 phase (1 year; n = 3 NHs; 1 NH per corporation) has
the following specific aims: (1) Refine the LOCK sleep program train-the-trainer protocol by implementing
and pilot-testing it. (2) Refine the research methods to effectively identify eligible NHs and residents, obtain
consent, collect primary data from residents and staff, explore staff impressions of additional sleep
measurement devices (Fitbits), transfer primary and secondary data to our data center, and merge all data.
After successfully completing designated R61 milestones and refining the intervention methods, we will
conduct a wedge-design randomized, controlled trial. The R33 phase (4 years; n = 24 NHs; 8 NHs per
corporation) has the following specific aims: (1) Implement the LOCK-based sleep program for residents
with ADRD using the train-the-trainer model. (2) Estimate impact of the LOCK sleep program on sleep (primary
outcome) and on psychotropic medication use, pain and analgesic medication use, and activities of daily living
decline (secondary outcomes). (3) Examine factors, using mixed methods, associated with variation in the
program’s implementation and its sustainability. This innovative program also has future potential to address
other important issues (safety, infection control) and expand to other settings (assisted living, inpatient mental
health). The study’s strong team, careful consideration of design challenges, and resulting rigorous, pragmatic
approach will ensure success of this promising intervention for NH residents with ADRD."
10831558,"NIH/NIA and Alzheimer’s association emphasize that capturing complexity in etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD) may substantially advance the understanding of the AD/ADRD pathogenesis. Mechanisms of complexity may involve various endogenous (e.g., genetics, epigenetic, cellular, physiology) and exogenous (e.g., environmental exposures, social milieu) factors, including those of vascular origin, and their interactions. It is recognized that novel insights into the complex biology and heterogeneity of AD/ADRD are needed to develop efficient interventions that can be tailored to a person’s unique risk profile. The objective of this project is to identify personalized (i.e., more homogeneous, group-specific) genetic and non-genetic profiles of risk of, protection against, and resilience to AD/ADRD and vascular diseases in the disease-specific and pleiotropic contexts. Our approach leverages an array of comprehensive methods which ensure synergism in dissecting genetic and non-genetic heterogeneity in predisposition to AD/ADRD in pleiotropic context. This approach overcomes core weakness in the rigor of prior studies characterizing effects of different factors “one by one” using analysis-specific methods. High potential of our approach is supported by our recent publications and rich data from the existing studies. We will address the following specific aims: Aim 1. Identify specific and pleiotropic loci for AD/ADRD and vascular traits from the exome-wide association study. Aim 2. Dissect heterogeneity leveraging the analysis of molecular signatures defined as differences in linkage disequilibrium patterns in affected and unaffected subjects. Aim 3. Identify personalized genetic profiles of AD/ADRD-specific and pleiotropic risks, protection, and resilience using rigorous methods. Aim 4. Characterize the functional roles of SNPs from the identified mono/polygenic variants and biological roles of genes for these SNPs. Characterize transcription pathways for SNPs using individual-level gene expression and epigenetic data and summary statistics from the available expression and methylation quantitative trait loci studies.):"
10931551,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The diagnostic process is an iterative, time-dependent, and collaborative decision-making process under
uncertainty to reach an explanation for the patient’s health condition(s) and communicate this explanation to
the patient. Appropriate healthcare delivery depends on the proximity between a patient’s health condition and
diagnosis and yet, diagnostic errors remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Considering
the volume and variety of primary care patients, combined with the practical challenges of scarce and costly
referral and testing resources, the incidence of diagnostic errors can disproportionally affect medically
underserved and vulnerable patient populations. Diagnostic disparities occur when preventable diagnostic errors
are experienced disproportionately among certain patient demographic subgroups. Research has shown
disparities in diagnostic error
s
by race and ethnicity, sex, gender, geographic location, and socioeconomic status,
in part due to implicit bias, discrimination, and stigma. However, the relationship between diagnostic equity
(i.e., diagnostic disparities related to diagnostic error due to systemic challenges in policies and practices) and
diagnostic uncertainty (i.e., subjective perception of an inability to provide an accurate explanation of the
patient's health problem) is poorly understood. Diagnostic uncertainty, a concept that has yet to be adequately
operationalized in medical practice, is a natural part of medicine and more common in primary care than any
other specialty. Identification of indicators and causes for diagnostic errors is crucial to avoid patient harm.
Previous studies linked diagnostic uncertainty to diagnostic variation (i.e., physicians providing different
diagnosis for the same patient), over-testing, increased hospitalization, and referrals. Yet, the connection
between diagnostic uncertainty and diagnostic equity remains an understudied domain.
While there is an increasing need to develop data-driven and evidence-based methods to study the relationship
between diagnostic equity and diagnostic uncertainty, the complexity, time dependency, and uncertainty of
the diagnostic process makes this challenging. Therefore, we have developed the Improving Diagnostic Equity
in Ambulatory care Settings (I.D.E.A.S.): Research to Practice study to evaluate diagnostic errors in the context
of diagnostic equity and diagnostic uncertainty through the application of decision-modeling and human factors
methodologies. The novelty of the proposed study lies in its unique interdisciplinary approach, bringing together
clinical diagnostician expertise, data science, operations research, and human factors engineering, to work
towards methodological advances in conceptualizing and measuring diagnostic errors. Expected outcomes will
lay the foundation for designing a comprehensive framework via an equity lens to connect diagnostic equity and
diagnostic uncertainty to inform interventions aimed at reducing diagnostic inequity and improving the
management of diagnostic uncertainty."

by the HIV epidemic. Tanzania faces an unfinished HIV testing, treatment, and viral suppression agenda because
of implementation gaps, particularly in children, adolescents, and young adults. Tanzania is also in the early
stages of evaluating strategies to integrate screening, prevention, and care for non-communicable diseases
(NCDs) into care for people living with HIV. The long-term success of HIV care and treatment programs and
achievement of HIV targets in Tanzania can be ensured and improved through this “Training Tanzanian
Researchers for HIV/AIDS Implementation Science” training program, a renewal application and joint initiative
by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH) in Boston and Muhimbili University of Health and
Allied Sciences (MUHAS) in Dar es Salaam. The Harvard-MUHAS collaboration has built strength in three main
HIV research areas: (1) public health interventions and Impact Evaluation; (2) implementation research in
programmatic HIV care and treatment services; and (3) research training. During the first five years, the HIV
Implementation Science training program met or exceeded each of its training aims which included the launch
of a new Master of Public Health in Implementation Science at MUHAS. For this renewal, the training program
will focus on HIV implementation research related to three new priority research areas identified through
discussions with Tanzanian policymakers and HIV program implementers, including: (i) HIV-affected children
(including children living with HIV and HIV-exposed uninfected children), (ii) Adolescent HIV, and (iii) HIV,
nutrition, and NCDs. The program aims to (1) train a critical mass of mid-level and senior researchers to work
as principal investigators leading independent research programs focused on implementation science questions
and teach implementation science research methods at the doctoral-level; (2) Build a critical mass of junior
public health and medical professionals who can design and successfully carry out rigorous research projects in
HIV Implementation Science, Impact Evaluation, and Health Systems Research; and (3) Extend the pipeline of
HIV Implementation Science researchers by developing a new PhD program in Implementation Science at
MUHAS. At the heart of this training program are five strategies both in Boston and in Dar es Salaam that will
achieve these specific aims, including: training 5 Postdoctoral Fellows, 15 Masters Fellows, 5 Doctoral Fellows,
offer 12 short courses in Dar es Salaam that will reach ~500 learners, and hold 5 annual MUHAS-Harvard
symposia to engage with government, implementers, researchers, faculty, and fellows. We will also launch a new
PhD in Implementation Science at MUHAS. Through an approach based on mutual respect and partnership,
our collaborative training program will integrate educational components and resources for fellows, equipping
them with tools to become independent leaders in HIV Implementation Science."
10831460,"Family caregiving for older adults is increasingly recognized as an impending public health crisis due to our
growing aging population and changing family characteristics. To achieve innovative solutions for the grand
challenges family caregivers face, academic entities, who have formerly operated separately, must coalesce to
share research approaches and expertise. The purpose of this K07 application, led by Dr. Lee Ellington, is to
build the Research Collaborative for Family Caregivers of Older Adults at the University of Utah and Utah
Health Sciences to ultimately support the health and wellbeing of family caregivers caring for older adults. The
Collaborative is designed to transcend traditional academic boundaries using a bridging infrastructure to
harness, connect and amplify existing strengths of five campus entities joining for the first time. These entities
include the Center for Alzheimer’s Care, Center on Aging, Center for Health Outcomes and Population
Equity in Cancer, Consortium for Families and Health Research, and the College of Nursing (5Cs). Each is
committed to starting new endeavors and expanding existing partnerships for caregiving science of older
adults through Collaborative activities. Each brings a unique cadre of researchers, trainees and junior faculty,
and has a distinct domain or focus that allows for rich cross-fertilization. In addition to collaborating with the
5Cs, Dr. Ellington will partner with a strong, existing University mentorship program to select and provide
value-added mentorship and training to 10 Caregiver Scholars fostering their potential to become leaders of
interdisciplinary research teams improving support for family caregivers of older adults. Finally, she will create
new caregiving-related curricula, which will be delivered through CCTS and the Interprofessional Education
Program. These curricula streams will have a wide reach at the University and Health Sciences, educating and
training both emerging researchers and the next generation of health care professional about caregiving for
older adults. Drawing from her current leadership experiences and enhanced by additional professional
development activities, Dr. Ellington is poised to achieve the following aims: 1) Leverage existing entities
across the University of Utah and Utah Health Sciences to establish an environment for interdisciplinary faculty
to share, collaborate, and advance research for family caregiving across mental and physical health conditions
and disabilities for older adults; 2) Partner with an established mentorship program at the University of Utah
and Utah Health Sciences to expand capacity and training to promising junior caregiving scientists who actively
participate in Collaborative programmatic activities; and 3) Develop and evaluate new curricula on family
caregiving for older adults to reach new investigators including emerging clinician scientists and future health
care providers. The Collaborative will increase the pool of investigators and promote the capacity and quality of
research; thus, elevating the University’s commitment to caregiving and aging science for the health and
wellbeing of caregivers of older adults for our state, our region and our nation."
10831464,"Project Summary
 Periodontal disease, which results from bacterial infection and inflammation of the gums and bone that
surround and support the teeth, affects nearly half of US adults over 30, with ~9% having severe periodontitis.
The hallmark of periodontitis is destruction of alveolar bone, resulting ultimately in extended tooth loss and oral
disability. Periodontitis is a major oral health problem, particularly among the elderly, that increases the risk for
systemic diseases, including atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes mellitus. The general goals of
this grant are to determine the role of newly discovered gingival solitary chemosensory cells (gSCCs) in
protecting against periodontitis, to identify the receptors, signaling pathways and effectors involved in innate
immunity evoked by gSCC activation, and to identify compounds that activate gSCCs to harness host innate
immunity to reduce periodontitis.
 Periodontitis results from polymicrobial dysbiosis, which perturbs the ecologically balanced oral
microbiota, and from disruption of the host innate immunity, which also contributes to the destruction of
periodontal tissue. While much is known about how microbes and host immunity contribute to periodontitis, it is
still unclear which gingival cells protect against the disease. Recent studies in several types of mucosae have
identified taste cell-like SCCs as specialized chemosensitive sentinel cells that detect bacteria and evoke host
innate immune responses.
 Most recently, we have identified gSCCs in the mouse gingival junctional epithelium that is part of the
epithelial barrier protecting against bacterial infection of the tooth and surrounding gingiva. gSCCs express
bitter taste receptors along with other taste transduction components, respond to bacterial signaling molecules,
and trigger intrinsic innate immunity to protect against periodontitis. The experiments of this proposal study the
role of gSCCs in gingival/tooth health to determine if gSCCs evoke innate immune responses that prevent
overgrowth of oral bacteria in the gingival mucosa (Aim 1); identify the receptors and signaling components of
gSCCs and the mechanism by which gSCCs promote gingival release of antimicrobial peptides and
inflammatory cytokines (Aim 2); and determine if “on demand “activation of the gSCC signaling pathway
reduces periodontitis (Aim 3). Understanding the initiating receptors and underlying mechanisms of these
responses may lead to new approaches to promote oral health and treat periodontitis."
10831846,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching objective of our program is to define general data science driven workflows that
incorporate physical organic precepts and can be deployed directly within the reaction
optimization process. Successfully developing such a workflow would have three key impacts
on the chemical synthesis enterprise: 1) significantly streamline the empirical, costly process of
reaction optimization, 2) algorithms would be applied to predict how new substrates, catalysts,
and reagents (as well as reaction conditions) perform in the reaction of interest as
extrapolations of this sort are poorly intuited. The ability to know quantitatively the
generalizability of a reaction will rapidly accelerate the uptake of new methods in chem ical
synthesis. And 3) as the data driven tools described herein utilize physical organic methods to
describe molecules mathematically, the resulting correlations derived from empirical data can
be interpreted to provide mechanistic insights into how catalysts/substrates interact. This
provides one with the foundation to “transfer” knowledge to new reactions and develop general
catalyst design principles. We plan to continue to deliver to the community a compelling reason
to change the culture of reaction development from empirical optimization and observations to
an insightful, efficient, and high quality data producing process. This work will be accomplished
in the context of asymmetric catalysis and focus on the following question: can we develop tools
to predict reaction outcomes for completely new examples not represented within the training
dataset required for the initial correlation, while simultaneously having interpretable/explainable
statistical models? This will be accomplished by exploring various enantioselective processes
catalyzed by a multitude of catalysts and interrogating the processes using modern
computational chemistry and statistical methods. We will validate these new approaches by
exploring if data-mining and new data collection can be used to build correlations with structural
features of molecules for the prediction of altogether new examples. Within this we will ask
fundamental questions about how catalyst dynamics coupled with non-covalent interactions
impact catalyst performance and how to compile this information for new catalyst design
strategies. Ultimately, we plan to deliver to the community a platform and pathway to facilitate
reaction optimism holistically using easy to apply data science methods."
10831847,"Morphogenesis is a fundamental process in a wide range of cell functions and therefore one of the best
studied. Consequently, most of the contributing component processes and the majority of their molecular parts
are known. Much less understood is how the many underlying component processes are integrated into a
working whole. This integration is regulated by a system of chemical and mechanical pathways with i) a high
level of non-linearity; ii) a high level of redundancy; and iii) a separation in space and time of cause and effect
between component processes. A key consequence of such a pathway configuration is that perturbation of any
component can lead to wide-ranging and fast adaptation. Hence, phenotypic changes primarily reflect a
reconfiguration of the system and not necessarily the function of the perturbed target. This challenge has
plagued the interrogation of molecular functions in cell morphogenesis, and has led to numerous controversies
that likely relate to slight differences in experimental designs triggering divergent adaptation processes. To
circumvent some of these limitations, my lab has developed over the past 10 years quantitative live cell
imaging methods that reveal the functional interplay between spatially and temporally distributed molecular
processes, such as cytoskeleton polymer dynamics, forces, and chemical signals, based on the coupling of
their spontaneous activation fluctuations in unperturbed systems. Building on key discoveries of cell
morphogenic control mechanisms, which required the use of a perturbation-free approach rather than a more
conventional experimental paradigm, we propose here an extension of this research program that will
introduce a rigorous statistical framework to infer the coupling of molecular processes in cause and effect
cascades. This includes algorithms to identify directly, from fluctuation time series, feedback interactions
between processes and the dynamic rewiring of the cause and effect cascades under variable cellular
conditions. These computational developments will be paralleled by innovation in experimental systems for
multispectral live cell imaging of up to 8 concurrent processes and for the analysis of cell morphogenesis in
native tissue environments in 3D. The studies will be focused on the coordination of the system of highly
redundant actin modulating factors in promoting actin mediated cell shape changes and the interactions of this
system with the regulatory system of RhoGTPase signals. The impact of this work will reach far beyond the
new insights we will gain of the regulation of these pathway systems. The work will address the notorious
adaptation responses of complex molecular systems, which are generic and a fundamental impediment to the
systematic inquiry of cell functions. The tools we develop to overcome some of these problems will be made
available as widely-adoptable approaches to the analysis of cell regulatory processes."
10831848,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immigrant populations face substantial adversity and acculturative stressors, with educational and work related
stressors often at the forefront. A substantial percentage of Mexican immigrants have very limited education.
They experience both economic and non-economic stressors in the United States. Paradoxically, immigrant
populations, including those of Mexican immigrants, generally have better health outcomes than subsequent
US-born generations. Recent research indicates that individual experiences and stress exposures translate
into physical changes to biological systems. For example, elevated stressors, such as those caused by
violence or trauma, can result in shortened chromosome telomeres. Telomere shortening is considered a
marker of cellular aging, and contributes to earlier development of age-related diseases, such as heart
disease. Resources, such as strong social support and religious beliefs, may buffer the negative impact of the
stressors. The variation in lived experiences of first and second generation immigrants and migrants, as well as
differential cumulative stress may be evident in biological markers, such as telomere length and DNA
methylation, allowing for a deeper understanding of the etiology of persistent health disparities. The goal of this
study is to determine how immigrant experiences influence individuals’ short- and long-term behavioral,
psychological, and physical health outcomes. This study will compare the experiences among first- and
second-generation Mexican immigrants and migrants living in North Carolina. We will conduct and analyze 60
semi-structured, in-depth interviews, subsequently administer closed-ended interviews with 375 first and
second generation immigrants and migrants, and collect a peripheral blood sample to analyze telomere length
and DNA methylation. This data will enable us to (1) identify commonalities and differences among first- and
second-generation and migrants’ experiences, particularly as they relate to immigrant or migrant experiences
using a qualitative data collection and analysis approach, (2) examine the association between first- and
second-generation and migrants’ experiences and behavioral, psychological, and physical outcomes using a
quantitative analytics approach, and (3) determine if measures of biological age, as measured by telomere
length and DNA methylation, are associated with generation of immigration or immigrant/migrant status and
physical, emotional, and behavioral well-being. This project is significant because it will enable us to examine
immigration is a unique life event and presents a unique set of stressors. The paradoxical relationship between
first- and second-generation immigrants and health outcomes suggests that the immigrant experience
contributes to these differences. This project is designed to identify the stressors involved in immigration as
well as protective buffers, and potentially the biological mechanisms they target, with the potential goal of
identify strategies to improve the behavioral, psychological, and physical health of immigrants and subsequent
generations."

10834738,"The long-term objective of this proposal is to understand in quantitative detail the cAMP- and Ca2+-signalings in sensory transduction by olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). We shall focus on the canonical
olfactory-transduction mechanism in the vertebrate main olfactory epithelium. This mechanism involves a
cAMP-signaling cascade, leading to Na+ and Ca2+ influxes through a cyclic-nucleotide-gated (CNG), non-selective cation channel to depolarize the ORN to firing threshold. The Ca2+ influx leads to signal amplification
via an inward Ca2+-activated Cl current, as well as olfactory adaptation via multiple Ca2+-activated negative-feedback pathways. Recently, however, the significance and performance of the negative-feedback pathways
are thrown into doubt and confusion. In Aim 1, we propose to re-examine this question and to settle it once
and for all.
 Most recently, by using M71-monoclonal-nose mouse ORNs, we have succeeded in quantifying the
density of M71-OR molecules on the olfactory cilia membrane. We also found that an M71-OR, when liganded
with acetophenone (among the most efficacious odorants for M71-OR), nonetheless still has a very low
probability of success (nominally ~10-4) in activating a single downstream Golf/adenylyl cyclase III effector
complex. This low probability is very different from the situation in rod phototransduction, about which we
recently showed that one photoexcited rhodopsin activates 10-20 rod transducin/cGMP-phosphodiesterase
effectors. Thus, a ligand-activated GPCR pathway may be quite different in signal amplification from a light-activated GPCR pathway. In Aims 2, we propose to study another mouse nasal chemoreceptor, TAAR4, which
is exceedingly sensitive to 2-phenylethylamine, a predator odorant aversive to mouse. The objective is to
compare the findings with those from M71-OR, to figure out whether TAAR4's molecular density on the cilia's
surface membrane is very different from that of M71-OR, and to ask whether the amplification at the
downstream G-protein/effector enzyme complex activation step is any different from the case of M71-OR. In
Aim 3, as another comparison, we shall address the same questions for mOR256-17, an OR with one of the
highest abundances known so far in the main olfactory epithelium and with an unusually broad odorant
spectrum.
 Quantitatively elucidating the steps of olfactory transduction will provide great insight into normal
olfactory functions, as well as malfunctions arising from genetic defects in the transduction pathway, as amply
demonstrated by the huge success as such in the case of visual transduction."
10833959,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall aim of this study is to develop and validate sensitive clinical and biological outcome measures for
clinical trials of patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), a fatally progressive rare neurodegenerative
disorder with no cure. Recent breakthroughs in MSA research have identified the crucial role of misfolded α-
synuclein as disease-causative mechanism and there are finally a number of candidate drugs in the pipeline
aimed at slowing or arresting disease progression. Multiple drug companies are now working toward MSA-
targeted therapies and two placebo-controlled clinical trials are ongoing. However, MSA experts along with
industry and regulatory agencies, have identified several weaknesses in our current clinical trial arsenal, with
the lack of sensitive outcome measures as the main limitation. At present, there is only one clinical rating scale
for MSA (the UMSARS) validated as outcome measure for use in clinical trials. The downside is that the
UMSARS is only moderately responsive to change, so it requires large cohorts of study subjects and a long
follow-up period to achieve sufficient statistical power to test the effect of candidate drugs, which is not ideal for
a rare rapidly progressive disorder. There is also a lack of imaging or biochemical biomarkers to track disease
progression. To reach clinical trial readiness for MSA, we propose an international, multicenter, prospective
observational study enrolling 100 patients with MSA followed for a year at 4 sites. We will leverage the existing
infrastructure of the Natural History Study of the Synucleinopathies (an initiative started within the NIH RDCRN
Autonomic Rare Disorders Clinical Research Consortium), and the European MSA Study Group, both of which
include an established network of highly collaborative academic sites sharing their data. With the support of
three pharmaceutical companies working on disease-modifying candidates for MSA, and the endorsement of
the major MSA advocacy groups, we have a unique opportunity for a tight collaboration of all stakeholders to
jointly address the remaining challenges and establish clinical trial readiness for MSA. Our GOALS are: AIM 1.
To develop a novel clinical outcome assessment (COA) and determine its validity. We will determine the ability
to detect change and the response rate of each item of the UMSARS and other clinical scales from historical
data already collected from 400 patients with MSA who were enrolled in the RDCRN Natural History Study of
the Synucleinopathies. We will remove redundant items or with little ability to detect change, and, with the input
of patient advocacy groups, will develop a new COA, which we will validate prospectively in newly enrolled
MSA patients. AIM 2. To compare the responsiveness of the new COA against the UMSARS and determine
the minimally clinically important difference. AIM 3. To validate neuroimaging and biochemical biomarkers of
disease progression in MSA for their use in clinical trials. Providing the tools necessary for accelerating drug
development will have a significant impact on ~15,000 living patients with MSA in the U.S. An external
Advisory Committee will provide guidance. Study data will be available to investigators or companies pursuing
treatments for MSA."

As of 2022, HIV infection and HIV-related diseases remain among the leading causes of death for children under
five, despite the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Children living in Sub-Saharan Africa face the highest
mortality rate, with approximately 1 in 13 children dying before reaching their fifth birthday. Moreover, HIV-
exposed uninfected (HEU) children (exposed in utero or during breastfeeding) have a higher mortality rate, more
frequent hospitalizations, and more severe manifestations of diseases compared to those who are HIV-
unexposed uninfected (HUU). It is estimated that there are 15.4 million HEU infants worldwide, with 90% of them
living in sub-Saharan Africa. Cross-sectional age-stratified analyses have shown that the bacterial community
composition in the saliva of HEU children changes from being similar to HIV-infected children under three years
old to being similar to HUU children at age four and older. Furthermore, the incidence of oral diseases increases
remarkably with age, which might be related to the development of oral microbiota. We hypothesize that the
oral microbiome of HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) children changes significantly during primary
dentition (age 3-5 years) compared to the other two groups, children who are HIV-positive and in care
(HIC) and those who are HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) during one year of follow-up. In this R03 study,
we will collect oral swab samples from 360 children at three visits (1,080 samples in total). Duplicate samples
will be collected and stored for future use. This proposed study focuses on the one-year change in the oral
microbiome during the primary dentition stage among three cohorts in Kisumu County. Kisumu is one of the
poorest regions in Western Kenya and has the third-highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS (19.3%) among children (0-
14 years of age) in Kenya. The research will leverage an important effort (parent study, R21TW012033) aimed
at studying the dynamics of HIV progression and oral diseases. The proposed R03 study will provide the
foundation for potential precise microbiota-targeted interventions to improve oral health-related outcomes among
HEU children. Meanwhile, this study will strengthen the capacity and infrastructure for integrating both medical
and dental care among HIV and HEU children in Kisumu, serving as an example of care for resource-limited
areas. This study will also provide valuable preliminary data for an investigator-initiated R01 research project
that aims to implement microbiome-based care into the routine care of HEU children. We will analyze the
samples using 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) at the V4 region. This way, we can compare our results with
samples collected in other regions using the same method. Additionally, we use 16S rRNA because it is the most
cost-effective approach for a large number of samples and is easily scalable to resource-limited regions."

While the systems that regulate circadian rhythms and energy homeostasis are tightly coupled together, the
pathways which connect them together are not well understood. Our recent findings have identified a novel,
physiological role for a subset of neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) that express the leptin
receptor in the circadian control of feeding, locomotor activity and associated metabolic rhythms. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to identify the neurocircuitry linking circadian rhythms to control of DMH
leptin receptor (LepR) neurons and associated feeding and metabolic responses. Proposed aims seek to 1)
characterize the rhythmicity of DMH LepR neuronal activity; 2) identify the contribution made by specific
subsets of these neurons in the circadian control of feeding behavior, metabolism and locomotion, and 3) to
identify upstream regulators of DMH LepR neurons that regulate circadian control of feeding and metabolism.
To accomplish this, we will integrate advanced neuroscience techniques including in vivo fiber photometry,
viral track tracing and chemogenetic techniques, along with an intersectional genetics approach and
comprehensive rodent metabolic phenotyping. Together, this work will fundamentally advance our knowledge
of the neural circuits underlying endogenous rhythms of behavior, feeding, and metabolism and can be
expected to facilitate the development of new strategies for the treatment and prevention of obesity and related
disorders in humans."

Project Summary/Abstract
We are currently seeking a 5 year renewal for our Training Program Grant in Occupational
Health Psychology (OHP) which has now been expanded to OHP-Total Worker Health. We are
requesting support for a total of 4 full time doctoral students per year. Funded as the first OHP
training program grant (TPG) in June of 2002, our program has served as a model for the
development of other OHP programs. We received a 5-year renewal in June of 2005, another 5
year renewal in June 2010, and then another 5 year renewal in June 2015-June 2020. The
graduate training program at Portland State University (PSU) is designed to address a growing
discipline of Occupational Safety and Health (OSH), namely, Occupational Health Psychology
(OHP), and the newly emerging discipline of Total Worker Health® (TWH). Our trainig program
has been squarely focused on OHP for the past 17 years and is now being modified as part of
our renewal to include TWH. OHP-TWH is an interdisciplinary field that involves the application
of psychological principles for improving the quality of work-life and for promoting the safety,
health, and well-being of people at work. OHP-TWH researchers and practitioners draw from
the domains of public health, preventive medicine, nursing, industrial engineering, law,
epidemiology, and psychology to develop sound theory and practice for protecting and
promoting safety, health, and well-being in the workplace, such as through implementing
interventions to eliminate or control workplace hazards and encouraging workplace
enhancements to foster worker health and well-being.
To date we have graduated a total of 28 students, with 8 of those graduating in the past 4
years with the OHP minor. All are employed in related fields using their OHP knowledge and
skills. We currently have 16 students in the program. Our students have been placed in
nationally-recognized internship programs and upon graduating they have been placed in
academic, government, and industry jobs related to OHP and TWH. Over the years, our
program has filled a need for specialized training in OHP, as well as a need for TPGs in our
region. During this funding period we proactively sought ways to ensure that we have a strong
multidisciplinary focus in the program and have significantly increased our collaboration with
faculty at the Oregon Health and Sciences University (OHSU) through our participation in the
Oregon Healthy Workforce Center (OHWC) described in the proposal. We have been involved
in the development of the joint PSU-OHSU School of Public Health, and we have strengthened
our ties with the University of Washington-ERC and the School of Public Health at Oregon State
University. Through these interdisciplinary and inter-institutional connections, we have
significantly expanded our program's focus from OHP to OHP-TWH, through expanding our
required and elective OHP-TWH courses and research/internship/job opportunities for our
trainees, as well as disseminating evidence-based OHP-TWH solutions to the national and
international communities via both the biennial summer OHP-TWH institute and annual fall
symposium on OHP-TWH. Furthermore, we have a wealth of methodology courses (e.g., Multi-
Level Modeling, Structural Equation Modeling) for students. We have also joined the
Consortium for the Advancement Research Methods and Analysis (CARMA) including webinars
as an additional methodological resource for our students. The primary long term goals of our
program are to provide formal graduate training in OHP-TWH and to serve as a national model
for OHP-TWH training that successfully balances science and practice perspectives while
remaining multidisciplinary in nature, and to support a developing graduate certificate in TWH
that spans across Portland State Univeristy and Oregon Health and Science University."

This proposal describes a five-year mentored physician-scientist training program to characterize the
mechanobiology of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) in cardiovascular calcification.
Cardiovascular calcification is a highly prevalent process whereby calcium mineral forms within the blood vessels
and heart tissue, and its presence is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Despite
decades of research, there remains no effective medical therapy to treat this process. Recent work has
implicated EndMT in cardiovascular calcification. EndMT describes the phenomenon whereby endothelial cells
lining the lumen of the heart valves or blood vessels are stimulated to dedifferentiate into mesenchymal cells.
Subsequently, these mesenchymal cells are capable of differentiating into various lineages, including the
chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages that can promote calcification. While EndMT is a promising target for
therapeutic intervention in cardiovascular calcification, characterizing the EndMT process in experimental
studies can be challenging. Current methods to assess EndMT, such as genetic lineage tracing studies and
immunostaining detection of endothelial and mesenchymal marker expression, are labor-, resource-, and time-
intensive. Further, these methods are binary assessments of EndMT and do not capture an important aspect of
the process – its dynamic mechanical nature. Endothelial cells undergoing EndMT alter their cytoskeletal
mechanics, detach from their neighboring cells, and migrate into the interstitial space. Thus, their mechanical
properties, or “mechanophenotype,” during EndMT are likely dynamic, but have not been previously explored.
In this proposal, we outline our aims to characterize the mechanophenotypes of EndMT, with the hope of
developing novel, high-throughput platforms to more rapidly identify possible therapeutic targets for EndMT-
related disease, including cardiovascular calcification. Further, the accompanying mentored career development
training plan will allow the candidate to develop the expertise needed to successfully complete this project and
will provide him with the mentorship and support necessary to become a fully independent scientific investigator.
In line with the strategic goals of the NHLBI, the aims of this proposal focus on: (1) elucidating our understanding
of the pathobiology of EndMT and cardiovascular calcification, and (2) developing innovative new platforms to
accelerate our ability to identify therapeutic targets for these processes, thereby advancing translational
research."
10849676,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is a devastating condition, affecting 3 in 4 breast cancer survivors.
Non-pharmacologic interventions (e.g. exercise, cognitive training) demonstrated preliminary effects for CRCI,
but their specific efficacies need to be confirmed in larger, rigorous trials using active/attention controls. More
importantly, given the multi-faceted etiology and presentation of CRCI, it is unlikely that a single therapy is
optimal for all patients; thus, there remains a critical need to test novel interventions and personalize treatment.
Acupuncture has a growing evidence base in cancer symptom management, but its role in treating CRCI
remains unclear. In animal models, acupuncture has been shown to modulate hippocampal expression of
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), an important cognitive biomarker. A Chinese study (N=80) found
that acupuncture improved cognitive function and increased serum BDNF in breast cancer patients compared
to usual care, but findings were limited by small sample size and lack of sham control, thus precluding
evaluation of specific efficacy. In secondary analyses of our recent comparative effectiveness trial (N=160) of
acupuncture versus cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), acupuncture significantly improved
subjective insomnia as well as perceived and objective cognitive functions, suggesting that targeting sleep
improves cognition. Acupuncture also significantly increased serum BDNF, particularly among those with low
baseline levels, whereas CBT-I did not. This suggests that BDNF is a specific mechanism by which
acupuncture influences cognition and could help to identify individuals most likely to respond to acupuncture,
thereby personalizing therapy. Based on this data, our central hypothesis is that acupuncture is an efficacious
treatment for CRCI that works through a mechanism involving BDNF and sleep. Building on this work, we bring
together a multi-disciplinary team to propose the Effect and Mechanism of Acupuncture for Cancer-related
Cognitive Impairment (ENHANCE) trial. We found that nearly 80% of breast cancer survivors with CRCI report
insomnia, echoing the growing research on connections between cognition and sleep. Thus, we will recruit 260
breast cancer survivors with CRCI and insomnia and randomize them to one of 3 conditions in an RCT: 1)
acupuncture, 2) sham acupuncture (SA), or 3) usual-care wait-list control (WLC). We will collect serum BDNF
and patient-reported/objective measures of cognition and sleep from baseline to Week 26. The Specific Aims
are 1) to determine the effects of acupuncture on perceived CRCI and objective cognitive function; 2) to
evaluate the mechanism of acupuncture on perceived CRCI and objective cognitive function via BDNF; and 3)
to elucidate the role of insomnia on perceived CRCI and objective cognitive function in context of acupuncture.
If successful, our study would expand treatment options for CRCI, advance mechanistic understanding of
acupuncture, and disentangle the relationship between sleep and cognition, helping to shift the treatment
paradigm towards a personalized model that targets CRCI phenotypes based on BDNF profile and insomnia."

More than 5% of US children and 45% of US adolescents have anxiety or depression; these rates have
increased for over a decade. Anxiety and depression are highly comorbid internalizing mental disorders that
often start during childhood and are associated with abnormal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
function. Early life stress (ELS) increases vulnerability to anxiety and depression throughout life. Accumulating
evidence suggests that ELS may produce long-lasting changes in gut microbiota contributing to abnormal HPA
axis function and behavior, which could play a pivotal role in internalizing behaviors. Many avenues exist
whereby microbiome composition may influence behavior and physiology, one of which is through altering host
epigenetics. ELS reduces folate-producing strains in the gut microbiome and folate is a necessary component
for DNA methylation. Recent work highlights potential interactions between microbiome and host epigenome,
with microbiota involved in regulating the host response to environment signals such as ELS. It is unknown
whether ELS influences gut microbiome composition in early development in humans or how the microbiome
influences HPA activity and internalizing behavior. We hypothesize that early psychosocial stress decreases
folate-producing genre in the gut microbiome which influences HPA DNA methylation and internalizing
behavior. Elucidating how environment and gut microbiome influences behavior will provide insights for a new
generation of effective interventions and treatments for mental health. This proposal capitalizes on two existing
cohorts: the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO; K99 Phase) and the Arizona Twin
Project (ATP; R00 Phase). Both cohorts have extensive longitudinal, affective behavioral phenotyping during
infancy, toddlerhood, and early childhood. Aim 1 will use existing ECHO longitudinal microbiome and ELS
metadata to determine if maternal depression during early childhood contributes to folate-producing relative
abundance. Aim 2 will determine if host DNA methylation is a mechanism by which the gut microbiota
composition influences internalizing behavior. The R00 Aims will extend our K99 results and determine if ELS
influences microbiome composition in adolescence and assess DNA methylation in relation to internalizing
behaviors. Using twin ACE models we can estimate the genetic and environmental influences of the
relationships between microbiome, DNA methylation, and internalizing behaviors. ACE model results will
pinpoint aspects of the environment, unconfounded by genetic influences that are crucial players in the
mechanistic pathway for mental health. Results will provide valuable information for the wider scientific
community in understanding early environmental influences on mental health through development."

Infectious bacteria and inflammatory insults can be so toxic to an organism that they require an immediate
response. One such response, called pyroptosis, causes an inflammatory cell death that both alerts the
immune system to the immediate threat and also ensures a continued inflammatory effort. In classical
pyroptosis, Caspase-1 or Caspase-11 (Caspase-4/5 human) cleaves the pore forming protein, Gasdermin D
(GSDMD). This cleaved GSDMD then oligomerizes to form a pore in cellular membranes. Gasdermin D pore
formation allows the acute release of IL-1 from the cell, while also destroying membrane integrity such that
mitochondrial damage and electrolyte imbalances quickly kill the cell. Implicit in this is that should pyroptosis
be blocked, either genetically or pharmacologically, neutralization of the pathogen is so important to
organismal survival that alternative mechanisms to initiate cytokine release and inflammatory cell death must
have evolved. We are only now beginning to understand these compensatory responses and their role in
shaping the immune response. Our preliminary data, with support from the preliminary data from the other
three projects in this PPG application, will establish that mechanisms of compensation involve both Gasdermin
redundancy and alternative protease cleavage events. We hypothesize that these compensatory mechanisms
are cell-type specific. We further posit that they influence the timing and amplitude of cytokine release, the
timing and inflammatory capacity of the resulting cell death and the in vivo immune response to inflammatory
stimuli. The overall hypothesis of this application is that mechanisms to compensate for loss of pyroptosis
alter the inflammatory and immunologic response to an inflammatory insult. We further hypothesize that this
compensation helps establish myeloid cell homeostasis and that disruption of these compensatory
mechanisms influences the pathologic development of Myelodysplasia and subsequent Leukemia progression.
The long-term goal of this work is to better understand how pyroptotic compensatory mechanisms influence
the inflammatory response and immunologic homeostasis in hopes of better understanding how to manipulate
these pathways in disease."
10861067,"Abstract
This project aims to define novel signaling mechanisms for the regulation of innate immune responses by
Gasdermins D and E (GSDMD/E) in granulocytic leukocytes that include neutrophils, mast cells, and
eosinophils. Physiological roles for GSDMD in both pyroptosis and IL-1β release during inflammasome
signaling have been extensively characterized in macrophages and other mononuclear myeloid leukocytes.
This involves cleavage of GSDMD by caspase-1 to generate N-GSDMD fragments which oligomerize in the
plasma membrane (PM) to form pores that mediate IL-1β efflux and pyroptosis. Notably, the granulocytic
myeloid leukocytes are also important sources of IL-1β during multiple innate immune responses, but few
studies have examined roles for GSDMD or other GSDM-family proteins in these cells. Our preliminary data
shows that caspase-1-generated N-GSDMD in neutrophils does not localize to the PM to form pores or drive
pyroptosis but is required for IL-1β secretion. This absence of PM pores reflects alternative subcellular
trafficking whereby N-GSDMD associates with azurophilic secretory granules (AG) and LC3+ autophagosomes.
Analyses using ATG7-deficient neutrophils indicate that IL-1β is secreted from neutrophils via an autophagy
machinery-assisted mechanism. These findings reveal fundamental differences in GSDM biology, including
high expression of GSDME, between granulocytes and macrophages that will shape granulocyte roles in
innate immunity. We hypothesize that the abundant secretory granules which define neutrophils, mast
cells and eosinophils underlie granulocyte-specific mechanisms for non-canonical production of
bioactive IL-1β and for regulated cell death via alternative pathways of GSDM family processing and
subcellular trafficking. In Aim 1, we will define signaling hierarchies based on activation of inflammatory
caspases, granule-derived serine proteases, apoptotic caspases, GSDMD, and GSDME that facilitate
alternative paths of bioactive IL-1β production by neutrophils, mast cells, and eosinophils. Studies will include
analyses of GSDMD/E trafficking to secretory granules versus the plasma membrane and GSDMD's ability to
act as a chaperone for autophagy protein-assisted secretion of proIL-1β that can be extracellularly cleaved by
serine proteases. In Aim 2, we will define GSDMD/E signaling networks that regulate granulocyte death
pathways which are induced by triggers of extracellular DNA trap release/ETosis, apoptosis, and progression
to granulocyte senescence. The project will draw on the strengths of the other three projects to facilitate our
functional studies. The results will define novel mechanisms for how GSDMD and GSDME mediate
granulocyte-specific signaling responses which play physiological roles during acute infection but contribute to
tissue dysfunction in humans with common autoimmune, allergic, or chronic inflammatory diseases."

ABSTRACT:
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in different individuals, or even in different
anatomical sites in the same individual, progresses along a variety of trajectories producing a
wide spectrum of clinical outcomes – from asymptomatic control to progressive disease. While
many immunological mechanisms necessary for protective immunity have been identified, and
are common between humans and small animal models, the basis for the variable expression of
these defenses and the consequent diversity in outcome remains unclear. We have identified
an immuometabolic axis that controls the ability of the macrophage to integrate proinflammatory
and regulatory signals and influences Mtb infection outcome. In this Project, we will investigate
the mechanisms linking mitochondrial function, the unfolded protein response, and the
macrophage’s response to Mtb infection in cellular models, in intact animal models, and in
multiple human cohorts. The ultimate goals of the project are: (1) to understand the mechanistic
basis for variable immune response to Mtb infection, (2) to identify new and mechanistically-
informative immunometabolic markers of disease progression, and (3) to test the efficacy of
candidate immunotherapies in promoting protective immunity."
10861332,"Project 2: Bacterial genetic determinants of susceptibility (Project Leader: Sarah Fortune)
Abstract:
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an incredibly successful human pathogen, estimated to have
infected up to a third of the world’s population. The field has traditionally considered Mtb to have
evolved its optimized virulence state in the distant past through thousands of years of coevolution
with early humans. There has been little consideration of the possibility that Mtb is continuing to
evolve to enhance its ability to spread within human populations. Here we seek to understand
how Mtb might be evolving to optimize its population level transmission, focusing on one family
of nearly identical strains of Mtb, here called the G2G strains, which emerged in Lima, Peru from
the globally dominant Lineage 2 strains, roughly 50 years ago and now represent ~90% of all
Lineage 2 strains in Lima. There are no obvious epidemiologic drivers of this population sweep
but we have identified a human genetic determinant of G2G susceptibility, which is a likely
regulatory variant of the lipid raft protein FLOT1, which alters many aspects of the inflammatory
response to Mtb. These discoveries make G2G an ideal case to mechanistically define the
bacterial determinants and host interactions that contribute to its population success. In this
program, we will address this question in the following Aims: (Aim 1) Genetic dissection of the
virulence related intermediate traits that distinguish G2G strains from the L2 strains from which
they emerged; (2) Definition of the course of G2G infection in mouse models of FLOT1 deficiency
and associated immune pathways and (3) Understanding macrophage responses to and control
of G2G infection using human FLOT1 variant macrophages. Because we understand so little
about bacterial determinants of TB transmission success of ongoing evolution of Mtb virulence
traits, this will be provide foundational data for the field to evaluate the emergence of other highly
transmitted Mtb strains around the world. These studies will contribute clinically relevant Mtb
variants to Project 1, which is studying the role of the unfolded protein response in Mtb infection,
because G2G strains fail to elicit transcriptional evidence of the UPR in human macrophages.
Similarly, in an effort to optimize vaccine strategies, Project 3 will use the G2G strain as a clinically
relevant challenge strain that is succeeding in the setting of widespread BCG vaccination."
10861334,"Project 3: Determinants of Vaccine Efficacy (Project Leader: Behar)
Abstract
The bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causes tuberculosis (TB), which is a leading cause of
global morbidity and mortality. Given the rapid spread of drug resistant Mtb strains, the long-term solution
must be a safe and effective vaccine. Much well-deserved attention has been devoted to developing new
vaccines against TB during the past twenty years, but without notable success yet. Key knowledge gaps
include the role of human genetics in vaccine-induced protection, the nature of protective immunity itself,
and the identification of clinically useful correlate measures. Moreover, given the challenges in testing
vaccines in NHPs, improved small animal models are of strong interest. To study how variation in genetics
and immunity affect TB vaccine efficacy, we have comprehensively analyzed BCG-elicited protection in
genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) and Diversity Outbred (DO) mice. CC / DO mice have vaccine
responses that differ quantitatively and qualitatively from B6 mice, and more closely resemble the variable
outcomes observed in natural human populations. Our data provide a rigorous basis for correlative and
mechanistic studies to identify pathways associated with vaccine-induced immunity. In Aim 1, we will
analyze BCG-induced immunity in CC strains that vary in their ability to be protected by BCG. We expect to
distinguish a subset of transcriptional signatures and immunological features that correlate with BCG-
induced protection from the pool of immune perturbations triggered by BCG but not associated with
protection. In Aim 2, we will identify alternative vaccine strategies that protect diverse CC/DO mice from TB.
Three novel vaccine strategies will be compared with the goal to identify CoP and to evaluate the use of
CC/DO mice as preclinical models for vaccine testing. In Aim 3, the features identified in vaccinated CC/DO
mice will be used to discover human immunological and transcriptional pathways that are associated with
different TB outcomes, using prospectively collected clinical samples from RePORT South Africa, and BCG
and M72 vaccination trials. Finally, Aim 4 will evaluate novel mechanisms of vaccine-induced immunity. For
example, BCG-protected CC strains have distinct immune responses after vaccination and Mtb challenge.
One of these, Th17-skewed responses, are associated with protection in mice, NHP, and humans, but the
mechanisms are largely unknown. In several CC strains, but not B6 mice, BCG elicits Th1/17 responses
that are associated with protection. Moreover, we identified a genetic locus that controls vaccine-induced
protection in DO mice and Th1/17 cytokine production in CC strains. We will evaluate engineered mouse
strains to define mechanisms of Th1/17-mediated protection and search for the causative variants
underlying these quantitative trait loci (QTL). Thus, in close collaboration with all projects and cores in this
program, the results from these integrated studies will leverage genetic diversity to improve TB vaccine
evaluation, identify cross-species correlates of protection, and reveal mechanisms of vaccine immunity."

We previously demonstrated that the patient and graft survival rates for HIV+ to HIV+ kidney transplants are
comparable to rates seen in other HIV+ transplant recipients. We also showed that these transplants do not
result in sustained HIV superinfection despite presence of a detectable donor viral inoculum in these recipients,
alleviating one of the major concerns with these surgeries.
This proposal aims to expand on these novel findings by initially exploring how the immune modulators these
patients receive may affect the HIV latent viral reservoir, which is the primary hurdle in the search for an HIV
cure. In addition, we and others have observed a possible increased risk of rejection in HIV+ kidney transplant
recipients in general. Therefore, we have partnered with the HIV transplant and pathology groups at UCSF, as
well as a team of other collaborators from the US, Spain, and South Africa, to examine the role of several
components of the immune response associated with organ rejection. We will also utilize this diverse team of
experts in HIV infectious disease, pathology, and transplantation to increase clinical and laboratory support for
transplantation services in underserved areas in South Africa, thereby increasing availability of these life-
saving transplants.
The results of this study will have a direct and immediate influence on transplant clinical practice in South
Africa and the US. Additionally, our study provides an opportunity to answer multiple fundamental biological
questions surrounding HIV cure research and HIV related organ rejection."

Stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) signaling pathways respond to a wide variety of stress conditions,
including DNA damage, oxidative stress, heat shock, endoplasmic reticulum stress, hyper- and hypo-osmotic
stress, shear stress, and a growing number of chemical toxins. We are interested in two general questions.
First, how do diverse stressors activate a small number of evolutionarily conserved SAPKs? We have
developed evidence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that a multitude of stress signals stimulate the two yeast
SAPK pathways – the Cell Wall Integrity (CWI) pathway and the High Osmolarity Glycerol (HOG) pathway –
through intracellular inputs at various points along these pathways, rather than signaling from the cell surface.
Second, how does the cell mobilize coherent, stress-specific outputs from an activated SAPK? The canonical
stress pathways respond to cell wall stress (CWI pathway) and high external osmolarity (HOG pathway), but
many stresses require the activated SAPKs to drive unrelated responses. We use the two SAPK pathways of
yeast as models for understanding the complexity of stress inputs to SAPKs, as well as stress-specific outputs
from activated SAPKs. This proposal is focused on identifying and characterizing the stress-specific
components and pathways that feed into the two yeast SAPK cascades. Aim 1 is to understand the role of
SAPK Hog1 in the intracellular activation of SAPK Mpk1 by heat shock. We have found that heat shock signals
both through the canonical CWI SAPK pathway and, independently, through a Hog1-dependent input to either
Mpk1 itself or its immediately upstream kinase, Mkk1. We propose a combined, biochemical, mass
spectrometric approach, together with a genetic screen to identify and characterize the pathway between Hog1
and Mpk1. Aim 2 is to identify and characterize intracellular inputs to the HOG pathway cascade by curcumin,
a promising cancer and Alzheimer’s therapeutic. We have identified two separate curcumin-induced inputs to
the Sln1 branch of the HOG pathway, one at the MEK kinase Ssk2 and the other at Ypd1, a component of the
HOG pathway phospho-relay. We propose a combination of biochemical and mass spectrometric approaches
and a genetic screen to identify novel pathway components to these two inputs. Aim 3 is to identify and
characterize the intracellular input to the HOG pathway by acetic acid stress. We have identified an input to the
HOG pathway from acetic acid that activates Hog1 either at the level of its MEK Pbs2, or at Hog1 itself. We
have also found that acetic acid stress is unusual in that it induces a stable interaction between Hog1 and its
MEK Pbs2. Our favored hypothesis is that this stress activates Hog1 through recruitment of a scaffold protein.
We propose a combination of biochemical and mass spectrometric approaches to understand the basis for
Hog1 activation by acetic acid, as well as the stress-specific Hog1 output elicited by this stress. Completion of
these aims will provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which these stress signals activate SAPKs."

such as cardiovascular, pulmonary or hematological disorders who will participate in the 10
week Summer Honors Undergraduate Research Program (SHURP) of the Division of Medical
Sciences based at Harvard Medical School. There are currently 551 alumni and 97% of them
have or are planning to continue training in the biomedical sciences. The objectives are (1) to
increase students’ knowledge of biomedical research and career choices, (2) to improve their
research-related skills and confidence in those skills, (3) to stimulate their interest in pursuing
careers in biomedical research, especially in areas of interest to NHLBI, (4) to improve the
students’ ability to select an appropriate program and to prepare a successful application, (5) to
provide intra-program and post-program mentoring, (6) to assist the program alumni in building
a professional network. The major focus of the program is research in laboratories of Harvard
Medical School faculty members who are successful research mentors in the PhD and MD/PhD

supplemented by required weekly student-faculty research discussion seminars, training in the
Responsible Conduct of Research, career exploration and development workshops,
participation in the Leadership Alliance Symposium, mentoring by graduate students, and other
opportunities to meet faculty and graduate and medical students. Applicants are recruited
nationwide through personal contacts with undergraduate program directors and SHURP
alumni, promotion of the program at minority science student research or career conferences,
mailings to science program directors, and print and on-line advertisements. Students are
selected from over 500+ applicants/yr on the basis of their interest in research, intellectual

evaluated by the trainees, faculty research mentors, trainees’ college science advisors. Follow-
up activities include regular contact with trainees to provide advice and networking
opportunities, a twice-yearly alumni newsletter, a periodically-updated alumni directory, campus
visits, and informal telephone, letter, and email contacts with program alumni. These contacts
also allow us to track the applicants and their career paths."

transcriptional targets. Further, single-cell cytometry and transcriptomics of T cells from FOXP3-deficient
patients and mice revealed a narrow cell-intrinsic signature of the deficiency, directly controlled by FoxP3, and
a larger disease signature, conferred in a cell-extrinsic manner, that affects both Treg and conventional CD4+
T cells. We hypothesize that these components vary according to the actual FOXP3 lesion, mutations in
different interaction facets leading to different pathology, and that environmental and activation triggers
promote the unfolding of the full cell-extrinsic IPEX signature. In Aim1, to better understand the components of
Treg dysfunction in IPEX patients, we will analyze the impact of missense FOXP3 mutations by single-cell
RNAseq in CD4+ T cells from paired IPEX patients and carrier female relatives (typically mothers), in which we
distinguish Treg-like cells expressing wild-type or mutant FOXP3 through random ChrX-inactivation and SNP-
based cell identification. Effects on chromatin will also be mapped (ATACseq), and related back to
symptomatology in these patients. To enable further analysis in a genetically and environmentally controlled
environment, where sample access is not limiting, Aim2 uses CRISPR editing to introduce eight selected
missense FOXP3 mutations from IPEX patients into B6 mice, where lymphoid and tissue-resident Tregs will be
examined and profiled. Super-resolution microscopy and HiChIPseq will assess the effect of the FOXP3
mutations on localization of the mutant proteins in the nucleus, in terms of nuclear structure and enhancer-
promoter loops. We will also analyze the timing and determinants of acquisition of the dominant Treg-extrinsic
signature. Aim3 will use this FoxP3 mutant mouse panel to ask how mutation-specific transcriptional features
relate to the IPEX-relevant clinical characteristics in mice: appearance of spontaneous autoimmunity (scurfy-
like disease), susceptibility to induced autoimmunity (colitis, dermatitis). Challenges with defined microbes and
microbial molecules will test the hypothesis that clinical variability in IPEX results, at least in part, from
environmental and infectious triggers. These interconnected Aims, with complementary explorations on mice
and humans, will bring unique information on how variation in a transcription factor modulates its ability to
influence gene expression through chromatin and genomic 3D architecture, and how these relate to a
monogenic loss of tolerance in human patients."

The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is designed to discover and characterize
the range of molecular transducers that underlie the effects of exercise in humans. MoTrPAC was launched in
2016 with six adult clinical centers and a pediatric center that have collaborated to generate extensive Manual
of Operations to guide research protocols involving all aspects of the clinical operations (Phase I). Phase II
began in the fall of 2019 with all human clinical centers showing excellent progress towards initial recruitment
goals and implementation of the protocol. The initial goal set forth by NIH was to recruit 270 children (10-17
years of age) and 1980 sedentary adults (age 18 years or greater) that are randomized to endurance training
(170 youth, 840 adults), resistance training (840 adults), or non-exercise controls (50 youth, 300 adults). An
additional group of highly active endurance (50 youth, 150 adults) and resistance (150 adults) trained individuals
serve as comparators and are not participating in the MoTrPAC exercise training programs. The recruitment and
enrollment approach are sex balanced and with participants across a wide range of ages (10-17, 18-39, 40-59
and >60-year age groups) and of different races. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, MoTrPAC activities were
suspended for over a year (beginning in March 2020) with continued constraints through 2022. Despite the
numerous challenges encountered as a result of the pandemic, recruitment activities at the adult and pediatric
clinical centers have accelerated to a rate that is projected to successfully achieve the target enrollment numbers
by the end of the new award period. This led to the NIH Common Fund to release the current NOFO (RFA-RM-
23-010) to provide MoTrPAC with funding to complete recruitment and follow-up for the clinical studies, including
finishing mechanistic randomized controlled trials of sedentary adults and children and observational studies of
highly active adults and children. This will enrich the participant cohorts that are critical to understand exercise
adaptations and heterogeneity across age, gender, and minority groups. Altogether, this extension will allow
MoTrPAC to complete the intended goals as originally envisioned and will provide a more complete public
database of the health benefits of exercise and provide insight into how physical activity mitigates disease."

An individual’s phenotypes related to their health conditions are associated with the complex interplay between
the individual’s genetics and their exposures to both internal and external environments. Nevertheless, genetics
only account for ~10% of an individual’s health, while the remaining appears to be determined by environmental
factors and gene-environment interactions. To comprehensively understand the causes of diseases and prevent
them, environmental exposures, especially the spatial and contextual exposome—social and ecological
contexts in which the person lives their life (e.g., social capital, climate) or external agents to which the
one is exposed (e.g., environmental pollutants), need to be systematically explored. Nevertheless, the
heterogeneous definitions of the spatial and contextual exposome and the heterogeneity of their data
sources require us to adopt semantic standards using an ontology-driven approach to (1) provide an
unambiguous and consistent understanding of the variables in heterogeneous data sources, and (2) explicitly
express and model the context of the variables and relationships between them.
 On the other hand, the rapid adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems has made large collections
of real-world data (RWD) that reflect the characteristics and outcomes of the patients being treated in real-world
settings, available for research. The increasing availability of RWD combined with the advancements in
analytical methods, especially artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer unique opportunities
to generate real-world evidence (RWE). There is also an increasing interest in spatiotemporally linking spatial
and contextual exposome data, especially contextual social determinants of health, to real-world observational
data including RWD to answer various questions on how exposures to environmental factors affect health status,
disease development and outcomes, and health disparities and equity. However, there are key gaps in the
research infrastructure to support these studies.
 Our long-term goal is to develop and disseminate methods and tools to advance spatial and contextual
exposome research with RWD. Responding to RFA-ES-23-002, the objective of this proposal is to develop an
innovative SPATIAL AND CONTEXTUAL EXPOSOME SEMANTIC DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM (SPACESCANS) with (1)
an ontology-annotated knowledge graph of existing publicly available high-quality spatial and contextual
exposome data from heterogeneous sources, along with (2) a user-friendly data integration tool that can guide
the users to choose (i) the appropriate spatial and contextual exposome variables, and (ii) appropriate
spatiotemporal linkage methods to link exposome data with their RWD, based on their study needs; and (3)
generate analysis-ready (and AI/ML-ready) RWD-exposome linked datasets for downstream analyses."
10841655,"Project 2, Abstract
Biotin is a universally essential cofactor for enzymes that perform various carboxylation, decarboxylation, and
transcarboxylation reactions. This includes key enzymes in fatty acid biosynthesis, replenishment of metabolites
in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid metabolism. When available, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
can utilize exogenous biotin but Mtb is unable to scavenge biotin from the host. To grow and survive in the host
Mtb thus needs to synthesize biotin. Mtb enzymes involved in synthesizing biotin, ligating biotin, or utilizing biotin
have been identified by this group and others as attractive drug targets because their inhibition has the potential
to shorten TB chemotherapy. However, a better understanding of the biology of biotin in Mtb is required to fully
and effectively exploit Mtb’s susceptibility to biotin starvation for drug development. This Project addresses this
need by (i) identifying and functionally classifying the genes Mtb requires to synthesize and utilize biotin, (ii)
defining activities Mtb requires to import biotin or recycle biotin, and (iii) determining how biotin starvation affects
Mtb’s response to host relevant stresses. These activities directly contribute to the overall program goal of
understanding key pathways in Mtb biology that are important in adaptation to disease-relevant stressors."

This NIH Mentored Career Development Award describes a three-year proposal providing the training and
mentorship necessary for the candidate to develop into an independent investigator studying the genetic and
molecular regulation of kidney development, with a specific focus on how mutations in Wilms tumor 1 (Wt1)
affect cell lineage crosstalk in the developing kidney. To accomplish this, the candidate has developed a
detailed career development plan integrating the outstanding mentorship and scientific environment at UT
Southwestern with focused training in bioinformatics and in-vitro techniques to successfully transition to
independence. Wt1, the first gene identified in Wilms tumor, regulates multiple aspects of normal renal
development and has been previously shown to play a critical role in nephron progenitor cell (NPC)
differentiation. Further examination of mutant kidneys with Wt1 loss-of-function specifically targeting the NPC
lineage (Six2cre;Wt1c/c) shows additional effects on the nephrogenic stroma, with an expansion of stromal
progenitor cells, disruptions in stromal patterning, and an increase in expression of several stromal markers
previously shown to be upregulated in Wilms tumors, leading to the hypothesis that signals from the NPCs
and/or early nephron structures non-autonomously regulate stromal development. The testing of this
hypothesis will interrogate how NPC-to-stromal crosstalk directs stromal progenitor maintenance and/or
differentiation in normal kidney development, which will be accomplished through two proposed aims. In aim 1,
experiments utilizing genetically engineered mouse models are directed at determining how signals from
nephron lineage derived cells regulate the nephrogenic stroma. To do this, stromal proliferation, apoptosis, and
patterning will be examined in mutant mouse models targeting different populations of the nephron lineage (ie:
self-renewing NPCs vs. early nephron structures) in comparison to the effects on the stroma identified in
Six2cre;Wt1c/c mutant kidneys. Aim 2 will investigate the mechanism(s) of NPC-to-stromal crosstalk, using
bioinformatics to identify candidate receptor/ligand interactions and in-vitro assays to functionally validate these
pathways by determining if disrupting specific signaling pathways results in stromal defects in control kidneys,
and likewise, if restored signaling pathways can rescue normal stromal differentiation in mutant kidney
explants. Given that advances in renal development research have significantly contributed to the
understanding of Wilms tumor, and vice versa, with the study of Wilms tumor biology leading to advances in
developmental nephrology, the aims outlined in this proposal have the potential to further uncover how intricate
reciprocal signaling interactions regulate progenitor cell proliferation and/or differentiation in normal kidney
development and provide the foundation for future work examining how disruptions in progenitor cell crosstalk
between the nephron and stromal lineages may alter the embryonic microenvironment and predispose to the
development of Wilms tumor."

 The overall vision of our research is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the
molecular mechanisms driving the function of a major brake to cell survival signaling, protein
kinase C (PKC), and its negative regulator, the PH domain Leucine-rich repeat Protein
Phosphatase (PHLPP). The PKC family has been intensely investigated in the context of cancer
since the discovery in the early 1980s that it is a receptor for the tumor-promoting phorbol esters.
This led to the dogma that activation of PKC by phorbol esters promotes carcinogen-induced
tumorigenesis. Nonetheless, PKC has been an elusive chemotherapeutic target despite decades
of research. In 2015 we reversed a major paradigm by showing that PKC generally suppresses,
rather than enhances, oncogenic signaling. This proposal aims to 1] understand the downstream
substrates and molecular mechanisms by which PKC isozymes brake oncogenic signaling and 2]
establish ways to restore PKC in cancer. Furthermore, we aim to understand the regulatory
mechanisms of its negative regulator, PHLPP, which we discovered in a targeted search for a
phosphatase that would dephosphorylate a conserved site on PKC and related kinases such as
Akt. PHLPP functions both as a tumor suppressor and as an oncogene and whereas much is
known about its substrates, downstream signaling pathways, and function, comparatively little is
known about its own regulatory mechanisms. This proposal aims to understand the structure and
regulatory mechanisms of PHLPP in order to inhibit target-specific roles of PHLPP, especially as
a way to restore PKC. The overarching challenge of the proposed research is to fill gaps in our
knowledge of the molecular mechanisms governing the regulation of, and signaling by, PKC and
PHLPP in order to leverage this understanding to develop effective therapies when these
mechanisms are disrupted in disease."

Lipids are synthesized and modified primarily by integral membrane enzymes embedded, at least in part, in the
bilayer itself. These enzymatic reactions are essential not only for the biosynthesis of all cellular membranes,
but also for lipid-mediated signaling and for the export of soluble molecules as lipid conjugates to outer cellular
compartments for a wide array of basic cellular functions, which include protein and lipid glycosylation, and
modifications of the chemical properties of outer membranes. However, despite the advances in our
understanding of how membrane proteins function, our knowledge of how membrane enzymes interact with their
lipidic substrates at atomic level remains scarce, also hindered by the hydrophobicity of the ligands themselves.
The main focus of my lab is to use structural biology – mainly single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)
– to investigate at a molecular level the interactions between membrane enzymes and their lipidic substrates. In
a structural biology-centered integrated approach, our structures, combined with computational experiments, will
produce testable functional hypotheses. We are interested in understanding how hydrophobic and hydrophilic
substrates are brought into apposition for catalysis to occur, on how chemical reactions involving charged groups
and an aqueous environment can adapt to process lipophilic molecules, on what are the molecular determinants
of substrate specificity for hydrophobic ligands, and on the role that the membrane itself plays in these processes.
We expect common principles on the interactions between, membrane, membrane enzymes, and lipidic
substrates to emerge from our studies.
We will focus our attention on the subclass of membrane glycosyltransferases that utilize polyprenyl- mono- and
di-phosphate sugar conjugates as substrates. These enzymes play a role in a wide array of biological functions
including providing the sugars needed for protein glycosylation, modification of the lipopolysaccharide
component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria in response to antibiotics, biosynthesis of the
bacterial peptidoglycan layer, and assembly of the mycobacterial cell well. We will work on individual enzymes
deciphering their molecular mechanism across their entire catalytic cycle, as well as understanding how these
might function as part of larger macromolecular assemblies, in a physiological context.
To succeed, we will combine our expertise in membrane protein production, biochemistry, and structural biology,
to that of our collaborators that are leaders in their respective fields. These range from computational biology, to
chemical synthesis of sugar-lipid conjugates, to biochemical analysis of LPS, to functional analyses of membrane
proteins in reconstituted systems, to the generation of tools to allow cryo-EM analysis of small proteins and time
resolved cryo-EM, to native mass spectrometry, to genetic modification of bacterial strains, to in cell cross-linking
and proteomics."
10844361,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a hepatotropic virus that establishes chronic infection in ~70% of those exposed. As
a result, currently more than 71 million people worldwide are infected and at increased risk of developing liver
disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. While effective interferon (IFN)-free direct acting antiviral (DAA)
therapeutic combinations are highly potent, the promise of DAAs has not yet put us on track to achieve the WHO
goal of elimination by 2030. Reaching this goal will require a scaling-up of HCV screening, linkage-to-care, and
reduction of treatment cost. Additionally, this will require understanding HCV spread, specifically how to prevent
the spread of viral antiviral resistance variants within individuals such that these drug resistance viruses are not
transmitted to the population. Importantly, viral cell-to-cell spread has been implicated in antiviral escape,
immune escape, and persistence of viruses in general. Thus, the insights gained through the study of HCV
should broadly inform future antiviral strategies.
Mathematical modeling of HCV in the serum of infected patients during therapy has driven our understanding of
HCV infection dynamics, the effect of IFN treatment, and led to methods for the quantitative evaluation of HCV
treatment efficacy. Since FDA-approval of HCV DAAs, we have pioneered the development of multiscale models
of DAA treatment response in vitro and in patients. This work revealed the dual mechanism of action of NS5A
inhibitors and has demonstrated that viral kinetic modeling might allow for a reduction in the duration of DAA
therapy in the majority of patients. These clinical insights have been informed by our modeling of HCV infection
in cell culture where we are able to directly measure both intracellular and extracellular viral and cellular
parameters. Applying both cell culture experimentation and in vivo patient data, we have recently obtained
evidence that viral entry/spread plays a major role in the maintenance of steady state infection having broad
implications regarding viral spread as an antiviral drug target and how spread impacts antiviral treatment
response in terms of drug efficacy, viral escape, and drug synergy.
Because these new models have raised important biological questions about HCV spread and antiviral drug
strategies, the objective of this cross disciplinary R01 renewal is to enable the improvement of the treatment for
HCV and other viruses by formulating and testing mathematical models of HCV infection and treatment response
in vivo and in vitro. The specific aims are: 1) Refine and validate time to cure predictions using in vivo and in
silico trials; 2) Elucidate quantitative details about the HCV life cycle and the role of hepatocytes in HCV
clearance; 3) Expand and optimize mathematical models of HCV cell-to-cell spread; and 4) Determine the
importance of cell-to-cell spread as an antiviral drug target."

Mutagenesis” (ECM) which has been under the direction of Dr. Stambrook since its inception in 1986. Dr. Alvaro
Puga, the Co-PI, has been a mentor in the Program since early in its history and has served as Associate
Director for the past five-year budget period, a role in which he will continue. The ECM training program initially
focused exclusively on environmental carcinogenesis and mutagenesis as its title implied. Subsequently, the
Program has evolved scientifically and conceptually. It grew to its current optimal size when the NIEHS directed
that it merge with a smaller training program in toxicology. The Program became scientifically more diverse which
has proven invaluable to the trainees. The ECM program makes every effort to retain this breadth of disciplines
to enhance cross-fertilization of ideas and techniques between the trainees. Thus, the trainees are able to
discuss cogently the impact of environmental exposures in terms of genetics, cell biology and toxicology and
ultimately in the context of human disease, including cancer. To preserve this wide range of disciplines, the
Program maintains a participating faculty of 26 who derive from 12 different departments/divisions from the
University of Cincinnati College of Medicine (UCCOM) or the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center
(CCHMC). There is a very close working relationship between the faculty of these two institutions, and the
CCHMC faculty all have appointments in pediatrics at UCCOM. The financial support committed to the ECM
from both institutions for recruitment and for other training-related expenses exemplifies this tight relationship
and support for the ECM. The ECM continues to build on its past successes, with its graduates populating
academic, regulatory and industry leadership positions. It also continues to fulfill a national need to train
individuals in the impact of environmental exposure relating to biological, oncological and toxicological endpoints
and human disease. Since its inception, the Program has emphasized recruitment of under-represented
minorities, and has been successful in this endeavor. Institutionally, the Program brings together the research
efforts of several laboratories to provide a common focus on exposure and environmental health, and facilitates
collaborations between these laboratories. The ECM encourages trainees to engage in research that combines
the expertise of several laboratories and institutional research cores. Our biweekly meetings where trainees
alternatively present their own data or a topical paper reinforce these interactions. Pre-doctoral trainees all have
the equivalent of an undergraduate major in a chemical, biological or physical science with superior academic
achievements. Many have won awards and recognition while in the Program. We select postdoctoral candidates
who hold the degrees of Ph.D., D.V.M. or M.D., based on proven academic accomplishments, and like
predoctoral fellows, we select trainees from a national pool of applicants. This renewal application requests eight
pre-doctoral and four postdoctoral positions, a size that we find optimal for the mission and goals of this Program."

Lesions to the human medial temporal result in striking and often long-lasting deficits in
delayed verbal memory, termed medial temporal lobe amnesia. While models of medial
temporal lobe function, such as declarative memory theory, hypothesize a restricted role
for the medial temporal lobe in memory function, a growing consensus in cognitive
neuroscience suggests that such deficits also include impairments in representations
important to other areas of cognition, such as perception, attention, working memory,
language, and spatial navigation. Here, we propose a novel model to better account for
the range of cognitive deficits that accompany medial temporal lobe lesions. Our model
hypothesizes that human medial temporal lobe function can best be described as
involving both representational precision and binding, predicting increasing deficits as
task-demands increase along these two critical dimensions. Experiments in Aim 1 test
our model with a particular focus on testing representational precision in the context of
memory and navigation to allow us to compare the outcomes from these experiments
against those predicted by declarative memory theory. Experiments will include testing
with bilateral medial temporal lobe patients, including those with lesions primarily
restricted to the hippocampus, and high-resolution fMRI studies in healthy participants to
better determine the mechanistic basis of hippocampal contributions to precision and
binding. Aim 2 will determine the predictive capacity of our model, in conjunction with
fMRI-based network modeling, to explain deficits accompanying unilateral medial
temporal lesions that occur as a result of surgical resections during treatment of
pharmacologically intractable epilepsy. The anticipated outcomes from the proposal are:
1) a more complete account of the consequences of medial temporal lobe lesions,
particularly to the hippocampus, on cognition than can be provided by
neuropsychological measures alone 2) a more complete predictive model of the effects
of unilateral temporal lobe resection on cognitive outcomes post-resection, possibly
allowing greater flexibility in determining which patients should undergo responsive
neurostimulation (RNS) vs. resection 3) modeling whether and how extra-medial
temporal lobe cortical networks can compensate for lost function following resection 4)
potentially, inspiration for novel therapies involving cognitive interventions or
neurostimulation targeting intact cortical tissue in patients with amnestic-like symptoms."

decipher the molecular programs responsible for the aberrant B cell responses underpinning
autoimmune diseases. A central tenet of the Emory ACE is that unraveling the heterogeneity
of human autoimmune diseases and translating that knowledge into mechanistically based
treatments requires an integrated collaboration between physician-scientists, basic scientists,
and expert clinicians with access to large populations of well-characterized autoimmune
patients. Our fundamental goals are: (1) to understand B cell dysregulation in SLE using single
cell interrogation of their molecular roadmaps, and (2) to assemble a scientific and
technological platform that engages other ACE U19 and UM1 Centers through the
Collaborative Project to perform similar studies in other immune cells and autoimmune
disorders. These goals will be realized through a highly integrated collaboration between the
three components of the Scientific Program supported by an Administrative Core. In the
Principal Project, Dr. Sanz will ascertain the heterogeneity of effector B cells, their regulatory
programs, and their differential utilization according to disease endotypes, and investigate the
diversity and regulation of SLE memory cells. Specifically, his group will analyze germinal
center dependent and independent memory and the role of antigenic persistence in the
regulation of autoimmune and protective memory. In the Collaborative Project, Dr. Boss will
investigate the epigenetic regulation of B cells and other immune cells in SLE and other human
autoimmune diseases as part of the Collaborative Agenda that will be developed within the
new ACE centers. Finally, in the Pilot Project, Dr. Scharer will pursue the functional
characterization of SLE B cell differentiation using high-throughput loss-of-function and gain-of-
function CRISPR screens. The Emory ACE also proposes to continue to manage the ACE
Funds Management Core and to establish a centralized ACE Biorepository Core to coordinate
the collection, storage, and management of samples from the Emory ACE and ACE Clinical
Projects and their allocation for use in mechanistic studies. Collectively, the work proposed
should contribute greatly to the charter mission and goals of the Autoimmunity Centers of
Excellence Network."

 Smoking is the largest risk factor for both lung cancer and obstructive lung disease. The National Lung
Screening Trial (NLST) enrolled subjects who reported a cigarette smoking history of at least 30 pack years and
showed that annual low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening could reduce mortality from lung cancer
by approximately 16%, compared to conventional chest x-ray. However, it remains clinically challenging to
efficiently distinguish the small number of malignant nodules from the many benign lung nodules detected with
screening. In addition, the chest LDCT data captured during screening also has untapped utility in quantitatively
evaluating obstructive lung disease.
 LDCT captures a wealth of information that can be automatically and objectively quantified and extracted
from the image data using computer algorithms. We have methods for automated segmentation of structures of
interest from the image data and will extract hundreds of radiological biomarkers focused on pulmonary nodules,
peri-nodular lung parenchyma, the whole lung, and capture lobar heterogeneity. This study will also incorporate
an objective epigenetic biomarker of smoking history via measurement of DNA methylation at cg05575921. Our
epigenetic biomarker has been shown to strongly predict smoking intensity by several studies. We will use the
objective radiological and epigenetic biomarkers and machine learning approaches to predict both (1) the risk of
lung cancer and (2) rapid obstructive lung disease progression in the NLST screening population. We
hypothesize that incorporating DNA methylation at cg05575921 will be a valuable addition to both prediction
models. Determining the outcome of the hypothesis will guide if this epigenetic biomarker should be incorporated
in prospective lung cancer screening studies.
 This project will have impact as it will result in an improved automatic risk prediction algorithm to guide
management in subjects with a lung nodule detected by LDCT screening. This approach can facilitate rapid
treatment for those with cancer and prevent complications from invasive diagnostic testing as well as
unnecessary radiation exposure from diagnostic imaging in those with benign lesions. Predicting rapid
obstructive lung disease progression may be beneficial for clinician/subject shared decision-making discussions
and targeted smoking cessation interventions in addition to improving lung cancer prediction."

 RNA-binding small molecules have the potential to modulate the expression of genes whose protein
products were previously considered “undruggable.” Risdiplam, targeting a precursor mRNA, was recently
approved for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and demonstrates the specificity and safety
attainable by this approach. Although a variety of small-molecule scaffolds have been uncovered as RNA-binding
ligands, their use is hampered by (1) lack of specificity and (2) unpredictable function. We propose a research
program that will provide RNA-targeting chemical probes that will avoid these drawbacks. Inspired by Proteolysis
Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology, we are designing chimeric molecules that will target RNA specifically
and carry (deliver) the ability to induce RNA degradation or inhibit RNA translation, in a highly predictable manner.
 Our initial efforts towards an RNA-targeting chimera platform use a newly discovered RNA-binding
coumarin derivative as a model and fine-tune its preferential binding properties through chemical modification.
Through structural optimization, which includes using a “bidentate” RNA ligand strategy, we expect to achieve
RNA-binding selectivity equal to or greater than that of oligonucleotides. At the same time, we propose to develop
and optimize three novel effectors to precisely degrade RNA targets or inhibit the target RNA translation. These
new effectors have shown promising results in inhibiting Zika virus (an RNA virus) gene expression. Ultimately,
our proposed work will generate a top-down method for designing selective gene expression inhibitors that are
independent of the gene's protein product.
 The long-term goal of our lab is to build a medicinal chemistry platform for making gene-specific and
patient-specific therapies using RNA-binding small molecules. In this process, we will not only generate various
tool compounds for studying important disease-modifying genes, but also combine computational and
experimental technologies to understand the detailed mechanism of RNA-small molecule recognition."

The VDACS, Office of Laboratory Services, Lynchburg RAHL meets all requirements to be
eligible for this funding. The Lynchburg RAHL is a participating laboratory in the Veterinary
Laboratory Investigation and Response Network (Vet-LIRN). It has met the requirements for
Vet-LIRN participation, successfully completing several proficiency tests for microbiological
testing since becoming a member laboratory in 2015. The microbiological testing that falls under
the Vet-LIRN mission is accredited to ISO 17025 standards by the American Association for
Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA). The Lynchburg RAHL utilizes the USALims Laboratory
Information Management System, which can integrate electronic reporting and data summaries
into forms that can be utilized by the Vet-LIRN Program Office (PO), thereby providing rapid
testing results during case investigations of potential animal, food or drug adulteration or
contamination.
Funding from this opportunity is being requested to widen, improve and develop testing
capabilities within the Lynchburg RAHL that would make it better able to respond to both routine
surveillance assignments with the Vet-LIRN, as well as to larger scale animal/food/drug
emergencies requiring enhanced surge capacity. The Lynchburg RAHL would upgrade obsolete
testing equipment and methods for microbiological identification of organisms, for detecting
antimicrobial susceptibilities of organisms, for supporting testing of animal/feed/drug substrates,
and for expanding the existing capabilities of testing. In addition, it would add the capability for
enumeration of bacteria, yeasts and molds in animal/feed/drug substrates. This increased
capability would also allow for participation in additional projects and/or method validation as
determined by the Vet-LIRN PO. Other activities would include using funds to further efforts to
adhere and maintain its A2LA accreditation status, as well as take advantage of training

early embryogenesis. Accordingly, our ongoing studies using human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESCs) 2D-

YAP KO-derived human 2D-gastruloids display expanded mesoderm and endoderm layers (ME) and reduced
ectoderm layer, compared to WT. NODAL signaling homeostasis is essential for normal gastrulation; active
NODAL cues are needed for ME differentiation. However, efficient NODAL inhibition is needed for the
acquisition of an ectodermal potential. Our data suggest that the gastrulation phenotype in YAP KO cells is
associated with an overly active NODAL signaling. The NODAL gene codifies for the ligand that activates the
intracellular Smad2.3 signaling. Interestingly, our transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis suggest that YAP is
needed to repress the well-characterized Proximal Epiblast Enhancer (PEE) of the NODAL gene during the
exit of pluripotency toward an ectodermal fate. Our data further suggest that YAP restricts the chromatin

forebrain, neural progenitors first produce neurons followed by oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which
migrate and divide to populate the neural tube. Subsequently, many OPCs stop dividing and differentiate as
myelinating oligodendrocytes. Whereas we know a considerable amount about the mechanisms that promote
oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, we know very little about mechanisms that regulate the very
earliest steps in specifying progenitors for oligodendrocyte fate. Based on our in vivo, live imaging-based fate
mapping studies, we discovered that different spinal cord and forebrain progenitor cells produce neurons and
OPCs. We have now used single cell RNA-seq analyses to identify a transcriptional state of these pre-OPC
progenitors, and have identified candidate cell-intrinsic programs and cell-extrinsic pathways that are conserved
between nervous system regions and across vertebrate species. Using zebrafish and mice as model systems,
this project will identify the molecular mechanisms that guide formation of OPCs from neural progenitors. Specific
Aim 1 will test a hypothesis that the pioneer transcription factor Ascl1 establishes the epigenetic and
transcriptional state of pre-OPCs. Aim 2 will investigate the mechanisms by which Notch signaling selects a
subset of neural progenitors for a pre-OPC fate. Specific Aim 3 will test a hypothesis that the transcription factor
Gsx2 helps specify a pre-OPC state and/or regulates a pre-OPC to OPC transition. The results of this project
have the potential for important new insights into developmental myelination, the causes of myelin disease and
potential strategies to restore myelin following disease and injury."

Recent developments in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), biophysical modeling, and computing have
improved the sensitivity of imaging metrics to detect disease-related changes in the central nervous system in
neurological disorders. This improved sensitivity has paved the way for utilizing these metrics as potential
biomarkers of disease, in particular, to measure disease progression over short durations. We hypothesize that
the multimodal analysis of MRI biomarkers (microstructure and morphology) from the brain and spine will improve
sensitivity to detect disease-related changes over durations as short as 3 to 6 months. Our hypothesis is based
on our prior work detecting longitudinal changes in brain microstructure over 6 months in an ALS cohort with
modest change in functional measures over that time, and that a multimodal analysis combining brain and spine
MRI measures can improve disease diagnosis accuracy. In this project, we will establish the scalability, sensitivity
over shorter durations, and overall clinical trial readiness of these metrics through a two-site study. We also
propose to improve the sensitivity of imaging metrics by combining multiple complementary measures from the
brain and spine in a longitudinal multimodal statistical framework. Additionally, we will demonstrate how these
imaging metrics correlate with fluid biomarkers and functional progression measures.
We will acquire structural (T1 and T2) and diffusion MRI data from 40 participants with ALS and 10 control
participants at two sites: the University of Minnesota (host institution) and the University of Florida. We will scan
the brain and cervical spine of participants at baseline and 3 follow-up visits (3, 6 and 12 months). We will
complete a neurological examination, ALSFRS-R, and UMN score at enrollment and obtain longitudinal
ALSFRS-R and plasma neurofilament light (NfL) measurements. We will extract microstructural and
morphological information from MRI data using dedicated computational methods and modeling. We will also
apply novel statistical tools to combine those complementary imaging metrics into a multimodal analysis. Finally,
we will analyze correlations between NfL, change in ALSFRS-R, and multimodal MRI metrics.
Upon completion of our project, we anticipate that the enhanced sensitivity of our proposed longitudinal MRI
biomarkers will have an impact on ALS treatment by providing novel surrogate markers as potential outcome
measures for clinical trials. The expected increased effect size will also reduce the cohort size needed to conduct
trials, thereby increasing their feasibility. Beyond the scope of clinical trials, our multimodal MRI biomarkers will
serve as an objective measure of upper motor neuron degeneration at the single patient level. Our MRI measures
will also be cross validated with fluid biomarkers and will contribute to efforts to stratify ALS patients into clinically
homogeneous cohorts.

Current data continue to reflect that the likelihood of being infected with HIV is elevated among certain groups
who have historically been less well represented in research, including youth ages 13-24, young people of
color (POC), and sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth. During the past 13 years, our team has completed
6 sizable HIV/STI behavioral prevention intervention studies with youth: 3 large-scale NIH-funded randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) and 3 smaller single-arm projects targeting reducing HIV/STI and syndemic health risk
behavior, generating a collective total of N=1,136 independent youth who were successfully enrolled in and
delivered HIV/STI and/or syndemic health risk prevention programming (>91% fully completing interventions)
and followed at 1-, 3-, 6-, and/or 12-months post intervention delivery (overall retention rates of >92% across
waves). When examined individually, each study revealed that youth significantly improved post-intervention,
but effect sizes were small. Yet, even among disparate intervention modalities delivered with high fidelity –
such as those targeting introspective examination of the capacity for change (motivational interviewing; MI),
education-based approaches, reward-based interventions (behavioral skills training; BST), and mindfulness-
based approaches, the differences between intervention types have been minimal. One consistent theme
relevant to youth intervention outcome emerged: the role of common factors, and specifically,
youth:provider relationship. For this proposal, we engage experts in clinical (MPI Feldstein Ewing) and
quantitative (Co-I Bryan) evaluations of HIV/STI and syndemic risk reduction with youth, advanced longitudinal
models of youth alcohol and cannabis use and their intersection with HIV/STI risk (MPI: Chung), and
longitudinal mixed-effects machine learning and patient-provider relationships (Co-I Yang, Consultant
Choudhary). Together, we aim to collaboratively harmonize our 6 sizable HIV/STI and syndemic behavioral
intervention studies to interrogate these data using cutting-edge analytic methods and robust machine learning
model testing. This innovative approach will unearth crucial relations in youth HIV/STI and syndemic
intervention response, in a diverse sample of youth at very high risk for HIV (M = 17 years of age, range 13-24
at baseline; 43% female; 21% SGM; 54% Hispanic; 9% African American; 7% Native American/Alaska Native).
These data are crucial to informing next step HIV/STI and syndemic intervention programming, as they will
illuminate what works (and does not) in this age group. In terms of study goals, this R01 will use an
atheoretical data-driven approach to harness youth prevention intervention data to drive a developmentally-
specific model of youth HIV/STI and syndemic prevention intervention response. Via machine learning, we will
investigate associations between youth:provider relationship and intervention outcomes (primary outcome:
HIV/STI risk behaviors) among adolescents engaged in HIV/STI risk behaviors."
10932983,"On any given night in the U.S., one in 10 youth aged 18-25 experience homelessness. The highest HIV risk
groups disproportionately experience homelessness. Yet, YEH lack access to HIV prevention including highly
effective pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis medications (i.e., PrEP, nPEP). Substance use and stress
negatively impact HIV risk. Stress contributes to condomless sex, more sexual partners, and substance use
with rates being twice that of housed youth. MY-RIDE, is a mobile health intervention that responds to
Ecological Momentary Assessments to deliver personalized messaging and behavioral feedback. Pilot data
found that MY-RIDE decreased drug use, sexual urges, and stress among YEH. This study will fully test MY-
RIDE by conducting a randomized attention-controlled trial. MY-RIDE addresses HIV risk and its antecedents
in real-time using messages developed using the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model. Using
Motivational Interviewing and Shared Decision Making approaches, nurse-led and on-demand sessions help
YEH engage in HIV prevention despite their unstable housing circumstances. YEH receive personalized
mobile messages that address their current HIV risk factors as well as substance use, mental health, and
housing. Aim 1: Determine whether MY-RIDE decreases substance use compared to attention control youth
(N=320; aged 18-25 years) at 3, 6, and 12 months. Aim 2: Determine whether MY-RIDE increases HIV
prevention strategies (condom use, PrEP uptake, reduced STIs) when compared to attention control youth.
Exploratory Aim 1: Evaluate MY-RIDE effects on willingness to take PrEP, stress, substance use urge, and
use of mental health and substance use services when compared to attention control youth. This innovative
study combines nurse-led counseling with JITAI technology to deliver personalized prevention supports at the
time of heightened need. My-RIDE is a highly scalable intervention that increases reach to a disconnected
population and facilitates delivery of an HIV prevention intervention that transcends barriers to access to care."
10837711,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Group 1, 2, and 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3) are immune effector cells that contribute to tissue
homeostasis and host defense against nearly all classes of pathogens, but their dysregulation also play key roles
in prevalent diseases such as cancer, obesity, asthma, and colitis. The transcription factor (TF) networks that
control the development and functions of the different groups of ILC have recently been identified. Yet how the
chromatin accessibility landscape and the 3-dimensional (3D) genome architecture determine the development,
homeostasis, and effector functions of ILC is largely unknown. Thus, the overarching goal of this proposal is
to uncover how the 3D genomic and epigenetic architecture regulate the development of each ILC subset
and to the development of allergic airway inflammation. It is now well-stablished that the transcriptional
repressor Id2 determines the commitment and identity of the ILC lineage. As such, Id2 expression is now
considered a hallmark of all ILC subsets in mice and humans. Our preliminary data indicates that Id2 expression
is controlled in ILC1, but not ILC2 or ILC3, by specific long-range DNA interacting loops between specific distal
cis-regulatory elements (cis-RE) and the Id2 promoter. Moreover, we showed that ablation of these promoter-
cis-RE interactions in mice leads to a dramatic reduction in ILC1 in multiple tissues, while the development and
functions of ILC2 and ILC3 were unaltered. Thus, our findings indicate for the first time that Id2 expression is
regulated by long-range DNA interacting loops between the Id2 promoter and distal cis-RE in an ILC-subset
specific manner. Moreover, it indicates that ablating these cis-RE is a powerful strategy to generate genetic tools
to study the roles of each ILC subset in the context of an otherwise intact immune system. Yet how the chromatin
accessibility landscape and the 3D genomic architecture determines Id2 expression specifically in ILC2 and ILC3
remains unknown. Thus, in aims 1 and 2 of this project, we will use novel genetic tools that we generated, single
cell sequencing technologies, and HiC to elucidate how chromatin folding and accessibility determine the
development and functions of ILC2 and ILC3 through the regulation of Id2 expression. In aim 3, we will exploit
the specificity of these regulatory mechanisms to study the functions of ILC2 during allergic airway inflammation
in the context of an otherwise intact immune system. Collectively, these studies will answer the long-standing
question of how Id2 expression is controlled to drive the ILC fate. Moreover, it will generate an atlas of the 3D
genomic landscape of each ILC subset, which
that
will allow us to identify unknown non-coding regulatory regions
are critical for the function and development ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3.Importantly, through the identification of
specific regulatory mechanisms in each ILC subset, we have created novel mouse genetic tools to study the
functions of each group of ILC in the context of an otherwise intact immune system, which might unveil novel
therapeutic approaches to target ILC during inflammatory disorders."
10826871,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Aberrant development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), including the axonal connections it receives, are hallmarks
of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders (NDDs). Foundational studies have shown that axons
that project to the PFC, particularly from thalamic nuclei, influence PFC development and function. Notably,
these axons are often disrupted in NDDs. We hypothesize that aberrant thalamocortical connectivity seen in
these disorders results from abnormal axon pruning, which in turn leads to deficits in PFC maturation and
function. To test this hypothesis, I will use a novel mouse model to inhibit axonal pruning in this circuit and
determine its role in PFC development. I will use a combination of neural tracers, genomic, and molecular
analysis to quantify axon pruning within the thalamocortical circuit to determine whether its disruption in our
mouse models affects critical aspects of PFC development including lamination, neuronal number, interneuron
migration, and electrical activity. This proposal, undertaken with the intellectual support of the Tri-Institutional
research community and guidance of a mentorship team, will address a significant gap in understanding of how
axon refinement regulates normal cortical development and can lead to cortical dysfunction seen in NDDs."

Abstract
Andrew Holbrook, Ph.D., is a Bayesian statistician with a broad background in applied, theoretical and compu-
tational data science. His proposed research Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning tackles
viral outbreak forecasting by combining Bayesian phylogenetic modeling with ﬂexible, `self-exciting' stochastic
process models. The development and publication of open-source, high-performance computing software for his
models will facilitate fast epidemiological ﬁeld response in a big data setting. Dr. Holbrook will apply his method-
ology to the reconstruction of the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic in the Americas, focusing on identifying key
geographical routes of transmission and phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness.
 Candidate: Dr. Holbrook is Postdoctoral Scholar at the UCLA Department of Human Genetics. He earned his
Ph.D. in Statistics from the Department of Statistics at UC Irvine, during which time he completed his dissertation
Geometric Bayes, an investigation into Bayesian modeling and computing on abstract mathematical spaces, and
simultaneously participated in scientiﬁc collaborations at the UC Irvine Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.
The proposed career development plan will establish Dr. Holbrook as an independent leader in data intensive
viral epidemiology by 1) facilitating coursework to build biological domain knowledge, 2) affording Dr. Holbrook
the opportunity to lead his own project while remaining under the expert oversight of UCLA Prof. Marc Suchard,
M.D., Ph.D., and 3) allowing Dr. Holbrook to continue his focus on quantitative viral epidemiology once he has
moved to a faculty commitment.
 Mentors: During the ﬁrst three years of the award period, Dr. Holbrook will work closely with Prof. Suchard,
continuing their current schedule of weekly meetings. Prof. Suchard is a leading expert in both Bayesian phylo-
genetics and high-performance statistical computing; and with his medical background, Prof. Suchard will advise
Dr. Holbrook in his expansion of domain knowledge in viral epidemiology. As secondary mentor, Prof. Kristian
Andersen, Ph.D., of the Scripps Institute will advise Dr. Holbrook in the impactful application of his statistical
and computational methodologies to the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic. Dr. Holbrook and Profs. Suchard and
Andersen will maintain their collaborations after the postdoctoral period.
 Research: Bayesian phylogenetics successfully reconstructs evolutionary histories but fails to predict viral
spread. Self-exciting point processes are devoid of biological insight and fail to account for geographic networks
of diffusion. Aim 1 addresses deﬁciencies in these two complementary viral epidemiological modeling techniques
by innovating a combined model where the phylogenetic and self-excitatory components support each other.
Aim 2 makes widespread adoption a reality by publishing open-source, massively parallel computing software
suitable for big data analysis. Aim 3 reconstructs the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic, learns key geographical routes
of transmission and identiﬁes phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness."

This is a request to upgrade our current Siemens SOMATOM Force research energy integrating
CT scanner to a newly released photon-counting CT scanner (Siemens NAEOTOM Alpha). While
we have made great progress in the use of quantitative CT imaging to sub-phenotype lung
disease there are limitations which this new scanner design will eliminate. Beam hardening is a
scanning artifact which makes the lung appear less dense than it actually is. Because the new
scanner directly counts every photon passing through the body and bins them into energy ranges,
by reconstructing the lungs with a narrower photon range (selected for the kV range which best
maximizes tissue contrast) will essentiall eliminate this error. Additionally, because the detection
of photons is a digital process, the noise associated with analogue to digital conversion of light
signals is eliminated, significantly reducing electronic noise. The spatial resolution is considerably
higher and there is a choice of keeping similar dose as previous protocols (which have already
been reduced nearly 10 fold) while taking advantage of the improved spatial resolution, or
significanlty reducing the dose further and keep the same resolution. Because the photons are
captured along with their energy characteristics, the photon count at each location can be binned
into energy ranges, allowing for the seperation of multiple materials such as krypton and
gadolinium for the simultaneous assessment of ventilation and perfusion. Additional contrast
agents are under development to also, simultaneously, tag inflammation. Because of the
improved contrast resolution, we will be able to further reduce the amount of contrast agent used
by as much as 40%. We propose 9 major projects, all associated with either multi-center studies
seeking new phenotypes of lung disease (COPD, Asthma, IPF, PASC (long COVID) etc. , or local
investigations into lung pathologies. The scanner promises to improve the ability to assess airway
wall thickness further into the lung periphery and to make possible the identification and
seperation of arteries and veins.with similar abilities to extend to the lung periphery. Through
deep learning and transfer learning, we propose that these improvement will help advance utility
of existing scanner images as well. Because we are the radiology Center, the scanner not only
allows us to take advantage of the advanced methodology locally, but we will be able to continue
to disseminate newer protocols, keeping the lung community at imaging state-of-the-art. There
are already 7 such scanners delivered to cinical centers within the US and this is expected to
rapidly expand. Thus, the opportunity for research translation."

Early language skills like word learning predict later school, social, and behavioral outcomes. While word learning
improves dramatically in year 2, so too do other social, cognitive, and linguistic skills, leading to debate about
the factors that support word learning, and why it improves. Understanding early word comprehension (which
precedes production) holds promise for clinical applications, where timely diagnosis and intervention is critical.
The proposed work ties early word comprehension to other improving skills within infants, across year 2. Its
overall objective is to establish specific factors that may make older infants better word learners than younger
ones, building the evidence base to support children who struggle with this critical facet of language in future
work.
Aim 1 is to test whether point comprehension is linked to robust word comprehension. Pointing allows child and
caretaker to draw each other’s attention to shared context, much as words do. While prior work links pointing
and language, none uses a fine-grained developmental lens with high-sensitivity tasks. Exp. 1 tests the
hypothesis that point comprehension, i.e. receptive joint attention, precedes and is correlated with robust word
comprehension by testing a longitudinal sample of 10-16 mo’s every 2 weeks on both skills. Aim 2 is to establish
the strength of the relationship between linguistic skills and robust word comprehension. Advancing theory on
whether and how linguistic skills support each other, Exp. 2-4 test 3 cross-sectional samples of 10-16mo’s on
word comprehension alongside their ability to recognize how words sound, and their skill at anticipating the
words and sounds in utterances as they unfold. Results will establish whether robust word comprehension is
correlated with and thus potentially reliant on these linguistic skills. Aim 3 is to disentangle the roles of maturity
and exposure by connecting new word learning to familiar word comprehension. Studies testing familiar word
knowledge have a built-in confound between exposure and maturation, since older infants have heard more
language, with repercussions for word processing. Studies of new word learning rely on overly simplified learning
processes. In an innovative 2-week picture book exposure combined with measures of familiar word knowledge
in 14, 18, and 22 mo’s, Exp. 5 isolates maturity and exposure to build a more cohesive theory of word
comprehension. The proposed work’s unique multi-task multi-age design ensures scientific rigor in providing
insight into exactly what improves over year 2, as infants become better word learners.
Successfully completed, this work will establish an important foundation for supporting children with language
delays and deficits, with particular relevance for ASD, Developmental Language Delay, and hearing loss."

Rapid advancements in genomics have revolutionized healthcare, technology, research, and beyond. The
demand for professionals with genomics skills, knowledge, and critical thinking is also increasing. Currently,
genomics skills are primarily acquired at major research institutions, leaving instructors at under-resourced
institutions unsupported. Community and technical colleges, which educate a diverse student population and
entry-level workers, face barriers in developing genomics curricula due to high teaching loads and limited
resources. We propose Faceting GEMs (Genomic Education Modules) for the Entry-level Workforce to
address this gap at under-resourced community colleges. Our program will (1) provide accessible, research-
focused genomics training modules, (2) train and motivate Partner Site faculty, (3) foster faculty community,
support, and collaborations, and (4) use scalable online platforms to promote genomics education. We will
create active learning modules built around authentic research experiences to deeply engage the capable and
driven participants at our Partner Sites. To address the scarcity of professional development opportunities for
community college faculty, our program offers an annual in-person ""Learn-a-thon"" at the Lead Site (Fred
Hutch). The Learn-a-thon will engage Partner Site faculty in research, train them to lead the modules, and
foster collaboration for module improvements. We will prioritize creating an authentic support network by
offering both synchronous and asynchronous forms of communication, while also providing funds for the
Partner Site faculty to visit each other and build deeper support systems. Outside of the classroom, Instructor
Guides and materials will be provided to encourage adoption of the modules by other genomics educators. We
will leverage our experience bringing online courses to millions of learners by scaling and publishing our
module materials as free Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), benefiting other educators and learners
worldwide. All materials will also be freely available on our website to promote broad availability. Finally, we
will assess our impact through evaluation rooted in pedagogical practices. The GEMs program leverages the
established Genomic Data Science Community Network (GDSCN), a collaborative that has worked to
diversify the genomic data science research community by engaging faculty from Historically Black Colleges
and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and
Community Colleges (CCs) across the United States. Our work proposed here builds upon this trusted
collaboration, ensuring continuity and sustained momentum in innovating genomics curriculum."

Project 4 focuses on developing generalizable approaches to the design, production, and evaluation of
two-component protein nanoparticle vaccines for arenaviruses, phenuiviruses, and paramyxoviruses. These
approaches will be enabled by powerful new machine learning-based tools for protein modeling and design. In
Aim 1, we will develop generalizable approaches to designing de novo protein nanoparticle immunogens that
display oligomeric antigens in specific geometrical arrangements with atomic-level accuracy. These methods
and approaches will be used to design nanoparticle immunogens that present trimeric paramyxovirus fusion
(F) and arenavirus glycoprotein complex (GPC) antigens, as well as tetrameric paramyxovirus receptor binding
protein (RBP) antigens. The designed nanoparticle immunogens will present each antigen in various
symmetries and valencies, with precisely varied antigen-antigen spacing and orientation, each an important
structural determinant of immunogenicity. In Aim 2, we will develop generalizable approaches to designing de
novo protein nanoparticle immunogens that display monomeric and heterodimeric antigens in specific
geometric arrangements with atomic-level accuracy. The orientation of these antigens—each of which has the
full set of 6 rotational and translational degrees of freedom since they lack internal symmetry—will be precisely
controlled to maximize the accessibility of epitopes that are targeted by neutralizing antibodies. We will design
nanoparticles in which the monomeric or heterodimeric antigens are presented in various symmetries and
valencies, with precisely varied antigen-antigen spacing and orientation. In Aim 3, we will produce the
designed vaccine candidates; intensively characterize their biochemical, biophysical, antigenic, and structural
properties; and rigorously evaluate their performance in immunogenicity studies and challenge studies in small
and large animal models. We will build on the Institute for Protein Design’s extensive infrastructure for protein
production and characterization to rapidly screen the large numbers of vaccine candidates we design using our
machine learning-based methods. Structural characterization at UW and deep mutational scanning at the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Center will both inform and provide rigorous assessment of the accuracy of our design
methods. Finally, we will leverage the deep expertise and new animal models developed at UTMB Galveston to
rigorously evaluate our designed nanoparticle vaccines and identify lead candidates for further preclinical and
clinical development."

76 externally funded research projects with a total award amount of more than $60 million. The
acquisition of this new microscope is considered essential in order for the OIF to continue
providing the needed services to a large number of NIH-funded research projects. The new
instrument is particularly critical to the major users listed in the proposal, whose highly
competitive and innovative research is dependent on the availability of this instrument.
Investigators, including both well-established and new investigators from diverse research
areas, will greatly benefit. The new instrument can truly lead to a better understanding of basic
biological systems and to develop novel therapeutic strategies in treating many diseases states,
including various types of cancers, brain injury, degenerative neurological disorders, immune
system disorders, atherosclerosis, and liver disease. The availability of this new instrument will
also stimulate other investigators at UT Health SA and nearby institutions to move their

array of disciplines in biomedical research."
10856553,"The PRKACA gene encodes for the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA-C). Recent ge-
nomic efforts have identified several single-site mutations, insertions, and aberrant fusions directly
linked to endocrine diseases. Specifically, a few somatic or germline mutations/insertions have
been linked to adenoma-associated Cushing’s syndrome and its associated cardiac myxomas.
Additionally, two chimeras are drivers for fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLHCC) and
intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasms (IOPNs) of the pancreas and bile ducts. Recent litera-
ture and our preliminary studies suggest dysfunctional spatiotemporal regulation and loss in
substrate specificity of PKA-C may represent common traits for the progression of these dis-
eases. However, there are no conclusive molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of
these diseases. We hypothesize that these PKA-C variants disrupt the allosteric cooperativity that
drives the assembly/disassembly of the regulatory complexes, unleashing active PKA-C. We pro-
pose to use state-of-the-art liquid-state NMR techniques coupled with biophysical and biochemi-
cal approaches to characterize the interactions between PKA-C and its regulatory subunits and
the endogenous regulator PKI. We will assess how mutations, insertions, and fusion chimeras of

 Despite a federal prohibition against marijuana, since 2012, recreational marijuana has been legalized
in 11 states and Washington DC where over a quarter of US population live. Among these jurisdictions, ten
states further opened or planned to open retail markets in near future to adults aged 21 years or older. The
efforts of protecting public health in the new policy regime, however, have been complicated by the lack of
knowledge regarding how individuals make purchase decisions and what regulatory measures would be
effective to reduce problem marijuana use. Particularly, the rapid adoption of novel products and the
coexistence of illegal markets pose unprecedented public health concerns and regulatory challenges. The
overarching goal is to examine the relationships between recreational marijuana regulatory strategies and
individual preferences for marijuana products. We will examine a wide range of policy measures that have
potential to influence individual decisions, including those regulating product characteristics, restricting
promotional features, modifying availability and context, and controlling price. We will innovatively test research
hypotheses using two behavioral economics approaches with distinct yet complementary strengths, namely
stated preferences approach and revealed preferences approach, and integrate them to provide calibrated
estimates. Specifically, we aim: 1) To quantify the relationships of product, promotional, availability, and price
attributes with individual hypothetical choices on marijuana products. 2) To quantify the relationships of
product, promotional, availability, and price policies with individual real-world choices on marijuana products. 3)
To correct hypothetical bias in stated preferences data with revealed preferences data. We will recruit
representative adult samples of never users, former users, and current users of marijuana to complete a series
of web-based surveys with rigorously developed discrete choice experiments on marijuana choices. To
address concerns on hypothetical bias, we will complement these experiments with revealed preferences data
on real-world choices through longitudinal cohort surveys in a subsample of the respondents. Particular
attention will be given to the heterogeneities in policy impacts among never users, former users, and current
users and among current users with medical, recreational, and dual purposes. The project will be the first
rigorous and comprehensive investigation of the impacts of policy-relevant factors on marijuana use decisions
at individual level. It will advance our understanding about the potential effectiveness of marijuana policies on
choices between traditional and novel products in the emerging legal markets. It will also shed light on the
unintended consequences of legal market regulations on demand in the coexisting illegal markets. Overall, the
project has potential to advance the methodological framework for predicting marijuana demand and facilitate
rational and informed design of marijuana regulatory strategies that can be directed to protect public health."
10849847,"PROJECT SUMMARY:!
Each year millions of patients undergo cardiovascular evaluation for stable angina, which is typically caused by
flow-limiting stenosis of the epicardial coronary arteries. However, up to ~40% of men and ~60% of women
with stable angina referred for coronary angiography do not have obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).
Even in patients with moderate to severe ischemia by stress testing, 21% have non-obstructive CAD, defined
as normal coronary arteries or <50% diameter stenosis in all epicardial coronary vessels at angiography. In the
absence of obstructive epicardial CAD, ischemia is often mediated by coronary microvascular disease.
Coronary microvascular disease is present in 25-40% of patients with ischemia and non-obstructive CAD and a
diagnosis of microvascular disease by invasive testing is associated with increased risks of death, myocardial
infarction, and heart failure. Non-invasive surrogate measures of coronary microvascular disease in non-
coronary vascular beds have not been identified.
Despite its prevalence and adverse clinical implications, the pathogenesis of coronary microvascular disease is
unknown. Coronary microvascular disease may reflect a systemic microvascular abnormality. Impairments in
microvascular function due to endothelial dysfunction, abnormal vasodilatory responses to stress, and
microvascular obstruction are hypothesized. Each of these processes may be in part mediated by platelet
interactions with the vascular endothelium. Activated platelets are known to induce endothelial dysfunction
directly and through interactions with inflammatory cells. Increased platelet aggregation has been reported in
stable patients with ischemia and non-obstructive CAD in comparison to both patients with obstructive CAD
and healthy controls. If platelets do mediate coronary microvascular disease, then modulation of platelet
activity could be therapeutic.
We propose to evaluate measures of platelet activity as a potential mechanism of coronary microvascular
disease in a cohort of men and women with stable ischemia and non-obstructive CAD undergoing invasive
measurements of microvascular function (Aim 1). We also plan to identify non-invasive correlates of coronary
microvascular disease in non-coronary microvascular beds that can be characterized in vivo (Aim 2). This may
facilitate diagnosis of microvascular disease in future clinical trials. This proposal will advance the training of
the PI as a clinical and translational investigator in ischemic heart disease through a curriculum of structured
mentorship, didactic coursework, participation in research-related conferences, and protected time for
research. The proposal addresses critical question 4.CQ.05 in NHLBI strategic visioning, will yield novel
insights into the physiology and mechanisms of coronary microvascular disease, and will provide a foundation
for future investigations into microvascular disease diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment."
10849857,"ABSTRACT:
Key components of skeletal muscle that regulate excitability and excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) undergo
major shifts of isoform expression during development. This process of perinatal ECC remodeling is highly
conserved throughout vertebrate evolution and results mainly from post-transcriptional mechanisms in which
alternative splicing of specific exons for ClC-1, CaV1.1, RyR1 and SERCA1 occurs. In myotonic dystrophy (DM),
these splicing switches revert to their fetal set points due to sequestration of MBNL splicing factors in nuclear
RNA foci. We used gene editing to recreate individual DM splicing defects in mice and systematically analyzed
mice for effects in isolation and in combination through breeding. Our preliminary studies indicate that loss of
ClC-1 function combined with CaV1.1 exon 29 exclusion (Cav1.1∆e29), comparable to that observed in DM
patients, results in severe muscle weakness and respiratory deficits and is lethal in mice by age ~9 wks. This
effect is rescued by long-term treatment by oral feeding with a Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approved
calcium channel blocker. Here we propose studies to define mechanisms and explore the possibility that drug
treatments that target myotonia and Cav1.1 channels can mitigate muscle weakness in DM. In Aim 1 we will
investigate the mechanism for the early demise of myotonic Cav1.1∆e29 mice, including the study of how
Cav1.1∆e29 channels impact membrane excitability and Ca2+ homeostasis, and downstream effectors that include
calpain, transcription and mitochondrial health. Further, we will determine if myotonic Cav1.1∆e29 mice exhibit
skeletal muscle weakness and altered respiratory function. In Aim 2 we will treat myotonic Cav1.1∆e29 mice by
oral feeding of FDA approved drugs that target the calcium channel or myotonia by factorial design (one, the
other, both or neither) to see which treatment is most effective at extending life and improving muscle and
respiratory function. In Aim 3 we will move the treatment into a CUG repeat expansion DM1 mouse model that
exhibits severe muscle weakness, myopathic features and shortened lifespan. We will use a series of non-
invasive techniques to measure muscle and respiratory function to determine treatment benefit in longitudinal
studies. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to identify DM1 therapeutic interventions that can be rapidly
transitioned to the clinic."

Project summary/abstract
 The purpose of our study is to determine the role of synaptosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) in Alzheimer's
disease (AD) progression and pathogenesis. Synapses are the most important compartments of neuron that
deliver signals to adjacent neuron and maintain healthy synaptic functions of the brain. Synapse territories are
composed of synaptic vesicles, synaptic proteins, mitochondria, neurotransmitters receptors, postsynaptic
density protein and localized small RNAs and miRNAs. Recently, several studies identified the miRNAs
enrichments at synapse, synaptic vesicles and synaptosomes. However, the role of synapse-associated
miRNAs in AD progression is completely unexplored. In the first part of our study, we will identify the
synaptosome-specific miRNAs that are deregulated in AD, and further, we will characterize their roles in AD
progression and pathogenesis. Synaptosomal fraction will be extracted from frontal cortex region of
postmortem brains from AD (n=15) and healthy controls (n=15). Total RNA will be extracted from
synaptosomal fraction and processed for miRNA and mRNA sequencing. The deregulated synaptosome-
specific miRNAs will be characterized in vitro using miRNA mimics and inhibitor(s) approaches and mutant
APP and p-tau cDNA constructs. Impact of synaptosomal miRNAs will be studied against Aβ and p-tau
induced toxicities. In second part we will determine the role of synaptosomal miRNAs in Aβ induced synaptic
and cognitive dysfunction in AD. The impact of synaptosomal miRNAs will be studied on healthy neurons and
AD neurons with Aβ induced toxicities. We will focus on neuronal processing, neuronal growth and network
development and synaptic plasticity using APP primary neuronal cultures. Alteration of synaptosomal miRNAs
expression and synaptic proteins will be studied with disease progression in APP transgenic (TG) and APP
knockout (KO) mice. We will execute the synaptosome-specific miRNAs expression with various cognitive
behavioral and biochemical tests in 2-, 6-, 12- and 18-month-old APP TG and APP KO mice lines relative to
age-matched TG negative wild-type (WT) mice. And in third part we will study the role of synaptosomal
miRNAs in phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) induced synaptic and cognitive dysfunction in AD. The impact of
synaptosomal miRNAs will be studied on p-tau induced toxicity in neurons, healthy neurons processing,
neuronal growth and network development and synaptic plasticity using tau primary neuronal culture. Alteration

KO mice. We will execute the synaptosome-specific miRNAs expression with various cognitive behavioral and

will provide the answers for - 1) presence of synaptosomal miRNAs at AD synapse, 2) synaptosome-

10849738,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is characterized by incomplete development of the left heart and affects
over 1,000 live born infants in the United States per year. Staged surgical treatment allows children with HLHS
to survive and flourish, but the right ventricle (RV) remains the sole functioning ventricle and the tricuspid valve
(TV) is their only functional atrioventricular valve. Tricuspid regurgitation is thus highly associated with heart
failure and death. Thirty percent of HLHS patients require surgical intervention to treat tricuspid regurgitation.
Despite incremental progress, understanding of the relationship between TV structure and tricuspid regurgitation
in HLHS is limited, and results of surgical repair are suboptimal. 3D echocardiography and quantitative 3D
echocardiography based analysis have dramatically improved adult mitral valve surgical planning and repair.
However, despite preliminary work with basic tools suggesting relationships between the 3D structure of the TV
and patient survival, and the unmet need for precise structural information to guide TV repair, there is no
commercial or readily available method sufficiently adaptable to model and quantify the unique and highly
variable TV anatomy in HLHS. As a result, the information in 3D echocardiography images remains latent, limiting
understanding of the relationship between TV structure and tricuspid regurgitation, as well as the design of
patient-specific repairs informed by 3D structural analysis. This proposal builds upon Dr. Jolley’s experience with
modeling of atrioventricular valves in congenital heart disease and the development of flexible open-source
modeling tools. The specific goals are to 1) investigate methods for quantifying TV structure from 3D
echocardiography images using metric based tools as well as novel shape parameterization and statistical shape
analysis; and 2) use these tools to identify TV structural correlates of TV dysfunction in 100 HLHS patients who
have completed staged surgical repair. The methods developed will be incorporated into the open-source 3D
Slicer imaging processing platform to catalyze future studies of congenital and adult structural heart disease,
particularly those not possibly using current modalities. These studies are the first step toward individualized
surgical repair of the TV informed by 3D structural analysis, and a detailed understanding of structural features
of TV dysfunction in HLHS. The proposal leverages the existing infrastructure and extensive expertise at the
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Queen’s University, and Kitware Inc. Overall, this study represents a
significant advance in the understanding of tricuspid valve disease in HLHS, as well as a flexible, and extensible
armamentarium of tools for the future image-based investigation of congenital and adult structural heart disease."

Thirty-two collaborative training faculty from the Departments of Chemistry, Biology and Molecular and
Cellular Biochemistry, and interdepartmental programs in Cell, Molecular and Cancer Biology (CMCB) and
Neuroscience, request funding to renew our predoctoral training program at the chemistry-biology interface
(CBI) in Quantitative and Chemical Biology (QCB) at Indiana University, Bloomington. Our training mission is
to transform graduate education in the molecular sciences on our campus by facilitating interdisciplinary and
collaborative research training in the chemical and biological sciences to address important problems in
biology and medicine. We outline an evolving, innovative and forward-looking program that takes our trainees
from mere technical proficiency in their chosen disciplines to the development of critical thinking skills across
disciplinary boundaries and professional communication and leadership skills that will allow our trainees to
thrive in the next stage of their careers. We couple a core didactic curriculum in chemical and physical biology
through two 1.5 credit core courses, Introduction to Quantitative Biology and Measurement (CHEM C680)
and Introduction to Chemical Biology I (CHEM C681) and QCB Journal Club (CHEM C689) to a topical
collection of extracurricular programmatic elements that are organized nearly exclusively by QCB trainees
under the leadership of two rotating QCB ambassadors. These programmatical activities include QCB
Student-invited Seminar Series and QCB Evenings, a “super-group” research seminar series, and the annual
Watanabe Symposium in Chemical Biology, which brings diverse scientists to Bloomington from academia
and industry to network with QCB trainees. Innovative programmatic elements include a trainee-run off-
campus retreat and an e-learning/”flipped” classroom instructional approach used to bring prospective
trainees “up to speed” on core didactic material and to significantly augment Plans for the Instruction in
Methods for Enhancing Reproducibility and the Responsible Conduct of Research. We also outline an
internship program for third year trainees to help prepare them for a wide range of career paths after
graduation. The program is directed by a Program Director and a Co-Program Director, each with
complementary expertise in physical and chemical biology, and is overseen by a Steering Committee that
includes preceptors from all five participating departments and programs. The Recruitment Committee is
charged with all aspects of identifying and recruiting training grant-eligible students for support by the program
in training years 2 and 3 or year 3 only. Our program enjoys strong financial support from the College of Arts
and Sciences and the University Graduate School who have committed fifteen (15) matching slots over the
five-year project period and significant matching funds for programmatic elements. Comprehensive diversity
recruitment and trainee retention plans are provided which will allow us to continue our efforts to maintain a
strong, diverse and inclusive trainee cohort."
10850246,"The Kritzer lab focuses on inhibiting protein-protein interactions involved in autophagy. Autophagy is a protein
degradation pathway that is active in all human cells, and inhibiting autophagy shows promise as a therapy for
late-stage cancers especially in combination with DNA-damaging chemotherapies. Autophagy research and
drug development currently rely on compounds that inhibit autophagy indirectly. Better, more specific inhibitors
of autophagy would be broadly adopted. A large amount of genetics and cell biology work supports that
inhibiting the LC3/GABARAP family of proteins can block autophagy selectively. In one series of projects, we
will develop novel stapled peptide and small molecule inhibitors of LC3/GABARAP and evaluate them in
models of late-stage cancers and other diseases.
Because of our expertise in compounds that bind LC3/GABARAP proteins, we also propose to evaluate related
compounds as autophagy-targeting chimeras (AUTACs). These compounds could be used to selectively
degrade any proteins in the cell, similar to proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) but potentially more
versatile and easier to develop. Based on strong preliminary data that validate the AUTAC concept, we will
develop novel AUTACs and demonstrate their ability to degrade endogenous proteins, unlocking a
broad new area for drug development in targeted protein degradation.
Over the course of developing stapled peptides as autophagy modulators, the Kritzer lab encountered a
common problem in the field: how to measure the amount that actually reaches the cytosol. In an
independent series of projects, the Kritzer lab has developed novel assays that quantitate the cytosolic
penetration of large-molecule therapeutics. In this proposal, we describe new opportunities to address
challenging problems in drug development for large-molecule therapeutics. We describe new methods to
measure penetration to different cellular compartments in any cell type, including primary cells. We also
describe a molecular evolution approach to develop a new “turn-on” assay that measures the real-time
kinetics of cytosolic penetration. We describe pooled CRISPR screens to reveal the cellular components
that mediate endosomal escape. Finally, we describe a novel screening platform that will allow us to screen
thousands to millions of molecules at a time for those that are most cell-penetrant; the new screen will be
incorporated into a design-test-learn cycle to produce data-driven design algorithms for cytosol-penetrant
molecules. All together, these data will represent a huge leap in our understanding of structure-penetration
relationships for several classes of large-molecule therapeutics."

The overall goal of the MARC program at UCLA is to increase the number of undergraduates from
underrepresented backgrounds who successfully enroll into graduate programs at highly selective, research-
intensive institutions and subsequently complete a PhD in biomedical fields. The program is designed to enhance
the scientific and career knowledge, skills, and experience of MARC trainees to prepare them for graduate
studies and enhance their persistence by building each trainee’s identity as a scientist. MARC trainees
participate in a structured program that emphasizes research training with outstanding faculty, development of
scientific writing and presentation skills, networking, and mentoring. Trainees will be recruited from life science
majors throughout UCLA to start the program as rising juniors conducting full-time research in their first summer
in the program. Trainees will work with research mentors that are active, well-funded, trained in evidence-based
mentoring practices, and enthusiastic about their role in nurturing the next generation of scientific leaders. During
the academic year, research will continue to be emphasized, and in weekly meetings throughout the academic
year, trainees will receive instruction, opportunities to practice, and feedback on their presentations and writing.
In the trainee’s second summer in the program, they will participate in a research experience at another
institution. Each trainee will present their research in at least two conferences per year, where they can network
with other scientists and build their scientific community. Throughout the program, the experienced MARC
directors will provide both formal and informal mentoring to the students to build lasting, supportive, and
responsive relationships with guidance that is individually tailored. Quarterly social events build community
among the trainees and other scientists from backgrounds that are underrepresented in the sciences. Rigorous
training in the responsible conduct of research and methods to enhance reproducibility, as well as informal
discussions throughout the trainees’ participation in MARC, encourages reflection on the intersection of science
and society and the roles that each individual plays in enhancing the human condition. The program emphasizes
development of trainees as leaders in their scientific fields by encouraging participation in all aspects of the
scientific endeavor.
We propose to select 15 new junior level students per year to participate in this 2-year program, resulting in a
total of 30 students in the program per year. The overall aim of the program is to have at least 80% of the trainees
enter PhD or combined PhD programs within three years of their graduation and completion of the program. The
cumulative effect of the proposed MARC program will increase the pool of strong candidates from
underrepresented backgrounds for PhD or MD/PhD programs, and contribute to the biomedical workforce."
10856921,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT:
Congenital or neonatal accumulation of chyle in the pleural space is the most common cause of pleural effusion
affecting 1 in 10,000 births with mortality rates between 20-60%. Neonatal patients with a spontaneous
accumulation of chyle frequently exhibit bilateral pleural effusion, severe respiratory distress, tachypnea, and
cyanosis, suggesting the mechanical effect of compression on lung compliance and impairment of gas exchange
in alveoli. Although Dr. Bartloet established accumulation of chyle in the pleural space as a lymphatic anomaly
in 1633, the mechanism for their formation and treatment have not been fully defined. Recent studies reveal the
requirement of prenatal lymphatic function to drain pleural fluid and promote the inflation of lungs at birth, which
is required for viability. To accomplish this, an extensive network of lymphatic vessels within the pleura, the
intercostal space, the perivascular spaces of arterioles and venules, and the connective tissue of the terminal
and respiratory bronchioles maintain fluid homeostasis and promote effective gas exchange. Abnormal dilation
of these lymphatic vessels, known as lymphangiectasia, is frequently associated with neonatal chylous effusion,
immature lungs, and severe respiratory distress with mortality. Even though Dr. Rudolf Virchow described
neonatal pulmonary lymphangiectasia as early as 1856, the underlying causal etiology and treatment options
remain elusive. Our preliminary studies identify an unexpected causal link between pathological MAPK activation
and lymphangiectasia in mice and humans. Pathological activation of lymphatic MAPK causes severe pulmonary
lymphangiectasia, accumulation of chyle in the pleural space, and complete lethality. Preliminary analyses of
human pathological tissue samples from patients diagnosed with lymphangiectasia revealed sustained MAPK
activation within lymphatic endothelial cells and recapitulated the murine phenotype. Mechanistically, the
genome-wide phosphorylated MAPK occupancy screen revealed direct regulation of an evolutionarily conserved
genetic program required for lymphatic vessel structure and function. This research program aims to identify how
the MAPK signaling pathway establishes and maintains a specific transcriptional program for lymphatic vessel
development. In addition, proposed studies will identify the mechanisms by which specific kinases and
transcription factors interact to regulate the chromatin recruitment of MAPK within developing pulmonary
lymphatic vasculature. The set of proposed studies has broad significance for understanding how signaling
pathways intersect with chromatin-modifying transcription factors to regulate the development of organ-specific
lymphatic vasculature and could be highly applicable to the entire field of congenital vascular diseases."
10853036,"ABSTRACT
Epigenome data are driving discovery in biomedical analysis of genetic variation and gene regulation. Epigenome
data produced by experimental protocols such as ATAC-seq or ChIP-seq are often summarized into sets of
genomic intervals deﬁned by a chromosome plus start and end coordinates. Databases now provide hundreds
of thousands of such region sets, each containing potentially hundreds of thousands of individual regions. This
data holds tremendous promise to understand gene regulation and disease because many health outcomes are
affected by genetic variation or epigenetic perturbation in regulatory DNA.
Many different tools and methods have been developed to assess such sets of genomic intervals. These ap-
proaches are used for a broad array of biomedical research, such as annotating genetic variation associated
with disease traits. Supporting region-based analyses, we and others have developed novel data structures and
algorithms to compare similarity of region sets and to compute overlaps between interval sets, enabling interval
comparisons on millions of regions. But as the genomic interval set data sources grow in size and scope, we
require both faster algorithms and novel methods to compare this important data type.
As the amount of available data increases, it is becoming intractable to compute exact overlaps. Furthermore,
the fastest algorithms only analyze pure intervals, not signal values, which could be used to compare interval sets
more accurately. Existing approaches have made little progress in the area of deﬁning canonical interval sets to
simplify analysis even further.
Here, we address these limitations in several ways: First, we develop novel, more scalable algorithms using
approximate computations and deﬁne the idea of interval set universes to consolidate analysis. Second, we
develop an innovative approach to analyzing region sets that goes beyond simply counting overlaps, instead
relying on cutting-edge machine learning methods to learn and measure similarity more accurately. We propose
a novel set theoretic approach building on techniques from natural language processing to compare intervals.
Together, we propose a ﬁrst-pass ﬁlter that can be reasonably computed on data sets containing billions to trillions
of genomic intervals, followed by a more accurate analysis to identify more subtle relationships among region sets.
These advances will improve both the efﬁciency and accuracy of existing biomedical research approaches, and
open the door to new ways of exploring the vast and growing corpus of genome interval data."

This proposal describes a five-year plan to prepare Steven Rhodes MD, PhD for independence as a physician
scientist studying the immuno-oncologic interfaces of neurofibromatosis (NF1)-associated peripheral nerve
sheath tumor progression. Dr. Rhodes completed his MD, PhD training at the Indiana University Medical
Scientist Training Program. Upon completion of his Pediatrics residency, he matriculated to subspecialty training
in Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, where he joined the laboratory of Dr. Wade Clapp and generated novel
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) recapitulating the progression of benign plexiform and
precancerous atypical neurofibromas to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a devastating form
of sarcoma that is the leading cause of death in persons with NF1. These GEMMs provide a tractable platform
to study the role of the immune microenvironment in governing the evolution of tumors along the neurofibroma
to MPNST continuum. Leveraging these GEMMs and samples from human NF1 patients, Dr. Rhodes discovered
that precancerous atypical neurofibromas are heavily infiltrated by T cells and exhibit signatures of enhanced
immune surveillance. These findings led us to hypothesize that T cells play a key role in preventing the outgrowth
of malignant clones in these precancerous tumors. The aims of this research are to 1) Define at single cell
resolution the clonal heterogeneity and functional states of infiltrating T cells in mouse models that recapitulate
the malignant transformation of plexiform and atypical neurofibroma; 2) Dissect spatial interaction networks
between infiltrating T cells and neoplastic Schwann cells within native tumor samples from NF1 patients; and 3)
Establish the utility of immune checkpoint inhibition, via CTLA-4 antagonism, to forestall malignant transformation
by potentiating T cell mediated anti-tumor activity in pre-cancerous atypical neurofibroma.
Indiana University School of Medicine and the Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research provides an
exceptional training environment for Dr. Rhodes to develop his research laboratory. The Department of
Pediatrics has an exceptional track record of NIH funded research (currently 6th in the nation) and offers access
to all the necessary resources for Dr. Rhodes to carry out the proposed scope of work. Dr. Clapp (primary
research mentor) is the co-PI of an NCI funded Developmental and Hyperactive Ras Tumor SPORE, focused
on NF1-associtated tumors, and has an exceptional track record of training young physician scientists. Dr.
Rhodes has assembled a diverse panel of mentors that will allow him to develop new expertise in T cell biology,
immuno-oncology and single cell analytics that will serve to distinguish him from his primary mentor and other
investigators in his field. Importantly, uncovering the cellular and molecular mechanisms modulating the
progression of NF1-associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors will provide key insight into the pathobiology of
the disease and identify novel therapeutic targets for treatment or ultimately chemoprevention, for which no
effective therapies exist currently."
10853124,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
While immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of certain malignancies it has yet to yield the same
results in breast cancer. This is striking, given that there is an abundance of intra-tumoral immune cells that
affect disease outcomes. Evidence suggests that these leukocytes are strategically positioned to execute their
functions and yet little is known about their spatial dynamics over tumor progression and regression. I aim to
detail a comprehensive and mechanistic picture of these spatiotemporal dynamics using recent advances in
high-dimensional in situ imaging. I hypothesize that as tumors progress, immunosuppressive cells will block
immune cell organizational structures and cell-cell communications that promote antitumor immunity and that
this phenotype will be reversed upon tumor regression. This will be assessed by characterizing the spatial
organization, cell-cell interactions, activation/inhibition markers, and cytokine production of the main leukocyte
lineages in situ over disease course. My preliminary data demonstrate that I can identify most of these major
immune cell types at once within breast tumors, including subsets of macrophages, dendritic cells, and T cells.
In addition, I found that two subsets of macrophages have differential localization: one which is intra-tumoral
and another that is almost exclusively peritumoral. This peritumoral macrophage population closely interacts
with T regulatory cells, which are important for immunosuppression in breast cancer. As such, I hypothesize
that peritumoral FDMs spatially organize to interact with T regulatory cells via TCR-MHC II, thereby activating
Tregs and skewing tumors toward an immunosuppressed microenvironment. To test this, I will use genetic
mouse models to deplete these populations in a tumor stage-specific manner and assess the impact on tumor
growth, survival, and response to clinical therapies. Overall, this proposal aims to understand the spatial
dynamics of leukocytes in breast cancer, which will reveal key cell-cell interactions, organizational structures,
and cellular communication networks that need to be disrupted/promoted in order to reengage antitumor
immunity, facilitating the development of effective immunotherapies."

High-content automated fluorescence imaging is a broadly useful cell-level bioassay platform technology that
can be used to interrogate biological systems in the context of drug discovery, and genetic perturbations and to
characterize physiologically relevant complex culture systems like patient-derived organoids. High-Content
Screening (HCS) and High-Content Analysis (HCA) are methods that combine high-throughput automated
fluorescence imaging and machine vision to extract spatially resolved, quantitative single-cell data used in drug
discovery and biological research. In the past 5 years, there has been a confluence of significant
advancements in high-content imaging hardware, precision patient modeling using organoids, and deep-
learning analysis tools that have significantly increased the utility of these methods. Typically, mammalian cells
are plated in multi-well dishes and are then incubated with substances, and after an incubation period, the
cellular morphology, and biomarkers of interest can be probed using fluorescent markers to quantitate the
effect and to gain information into the mechanism of action. HCS is one of the main modalities of phenotypic
screening wherein thousands of compounds/conditions can be tested to deliver a single-cell and multivariate
readout toward the identification of compounds/conditions with therapeutic potential in cell-based disease
models. Conventional fluorescence microscopy is low throughput and generally yields qualitative results to
support other experimental methodologies. HCS addresses both the bottleneck in data acquisition through
automation and analysis with machine vision software used to identify cells and extract biomarker intensity and
morphologic features for further analysis. Additionally, the quality of the high-content microscope, optics, and
robotic control directly influence the types of experiments that can be achieved with the more advanced
microscopes being capable of higher throughput, live-cell analysis, drug dispensing, and higher resolution
confocal fluorescence images. The Yokogawa CellVoyager 8000 is a state-of-the-art high-content imaging
platform that has 4-cameras, spinning disc confocal with water-immersion objective lenses that can
accommodate fixed or live cells in a wide array of samples/formats. The U-M Center for Drug Repurposing has
extensive experience in the development of highly physiologically-relevant in vitro disease models, high-
content assay development, and in conducting large-scale high throughput screening. There is currently no
laser-based high-content imaging microscope at U-M. The addition of the Yokogawa CellVoyager 8000 will
significantly enhance drug discovery, drug repurposing, and quantitative biological imaging efforts at U-M."
10830205,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Carbapenem resistant organisms (CRO) have been designated by the CDC as an urgent threat to
human health. Specifically, species of Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that render
resistance to carbapenems through the production of degradative β-lactamase enzymes, known as
carbapenemases, are associated with high mortality rates and require stringent infection control
measures. Unlike non-carbapenemase-producing CROs, CROs that mediate carbapenem resistance
through the production of carbapenemases (CPOs) contain plasmids encoding for these degradative
enzymes that can be transmitted among pathogenic bacteria, making containment of these organisms
of high priority. Further, CPOs are commonly multidrug resistant, increasing the probability of treatment
failure.
Unfortunately, commercially tests available to detect and characterize CPOs are standalone tests that
are not performed until after standard AST results are available. This segmented diagnostic workflow
can extend the time to CPO detection to 2-7 days. As a results, CPO-related infections can cost
healthcare centers $22,484 to $66,031 per patient. Therefore, a diagnostic test that could be integrated
into standard AST panel/systems to offer susceptibility results and CPO confirmation and classification
information simultaneously would inform treatment selection and infection control measures days
sooner. Herein, we propose the development of a biochemical assay powered by DETECT (Dual-
Enzyme Trigger-Enabled Cascade Technology) to offer the first CPO identification and classification
test compatible with automated AST systems.
DETECT is comprised of targeting and signaling tiers which can be individually modified. The targeting
tier features a small molecule probe that mimics the structure of β-lactam antibiotics, with each unique
probe displaying distinct recognition for variants and/or classes of these degradative enzymes. We have
demonstrated our capacity to synthetically modify the small molecule probe to capture variants of
extended spectrum-β-lactamases, and the objectives described herein represent two independent
methods of tuning DETECT to capture carbapenemases-producing organisms.
If successful, the test formats produced in Aims 1 and 2 would represent unique and/or combination
products, which would be optimized for use with a specific AST system in a Phase II project. The final
desired test - an AST panel/plate with carbapenemase-targeting DETECT components integrated into
the wells, would streamline existing clinical workflows, expedite care delivery to patients, and accelerate
infection control de-escalation measures."

The Single Cell Sequencing and Bioinformatics Core (Core A) is designed to support all Program Projects in
their studies of how external, modifiable risk factors influence the progression of clonal hematopoiesis to
hematologic malignancy in mice and humans. Two major themes of the Program – understanding how cells with
specific mutations respond to modifiable stressors and evaluating the impact of individual mutant clones on
others in the ecosystem – both depend on single-cell analysis of cells. The mission of this Core is to provide
advanced technical and analytical platforms to track and characterize human and murine mutant cells at single-
cell resolution, followed by bioinformatics and mathematical analyses necessary to interpret the data. The Core
will (1) provide high-throughput single-cell genomic analysis and other advanced sequencing platforms to all
Projects; (2) will provide bioinformatics analysis of multi-dimensional datasets and facilitate data sharing; and (3)
will develop mathematical modeling based on large-scale molecular data from mice and humans. To support the
first aim, the core is equipped with various single-cell genomics platforms such as Chromium (10X Genomics)

hematologic malignancies, making him ideally suited to lead to this Program-specific Core. In the second aim,
the Core will provide necessary bioinformatic support in analyzing large-scale epigenetic and transcriptomic data
in response to modifiable extrinsic risk factors (infection and obesity in Project 1; chemotherapy and smoking in
Project 2) to understand the biological effects of stress on clonal hematopoiesis and malignant transformation.
In the third aim, the Core will utilize broad epidemiologic data to develop a mathematical model to predict the
risk that CH progresses to frank hematologic malignancy in individuals based on their genetic variants, clone
size (as measured by variant allele frequency), and specific exposures to modifiable external risk factors (e.g.
smoking, obesity, infection, chemotherapies). Dr. Marek Kimmel, Co-Leader of the Core, has an extensive
background in mathematical modeling of stem cell dynamics and cancer and is well-positioned to lead this aspect
of the Core. This Core will coordinate data storage and quality controls (QC) to ensure the rigor and
reproducibility of the data and facilitate public data sharing. Overall, Core A will provide cutting-edge technical
and analytical support for all three proposed Projects and support statistical rigor and reproducibility, with support
from Core B. By centralizing data analysis and storage, this Core will facilitate the integration of datasets and
cross-sectional analyses in order to optimize crosstalk between the large-scale mechanistic animal and human
epidemiology studies in this Program. The work of this Core is central to the Program’s overall goal of elucidating
the mechanisms of clonal dynamics in response to modifiable external stressors."
10838150,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The research objective of this proposal is to develop a technology-based HIV prevention intervention for Black
women in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. The intervention will be based on the previously developed
culturally-adapted Safer Sex Skills Building intervention (SSSB), aligned with modern prevention efforts, and
informed by intersectionality. Black women with SUD continue to be gravely impacted by the HIV epidemic. In
2020, Black women made up 13% of the general female population yet accounted for over 50% of new HIV
infections. Given the gender norms and social expectations (present within both Black and substance using
communities) related to sexual behavior, Black women with SUD are uniquely at risk. These women are also
impacted by intersecting systems of oppression (e.g., racism, sexism, substance use stigma) that influence
HIV risk. These unique experiences underscore the need for culturally specific interventions. Furthermore, from
2015-2019, only 16.5% of Black women who needed SUD treatment received it. This disparity could result in a
limited number of Black women within a single SUD treatment setting at the same time, which could be a
barrier to in-person interventions. Technology-based interventions have demonstrated effectiveness for SUD
treatment and HIV prevention/treatment among Black women, suggesting that technology could be leveraged
to address this gap. The proposal has the following aims: 1) Examine psychological and social determinants of
sexual risk behaviors among Black women in SUD treatment through an intersectional lens, 2) Deepen
understanding of sexual risk behavior through an intersectionality framework and identify culturally-informed
approaches for reducing sexual risk behavior, and 3) Design a technology-based HIV prevention intervention
for Black women in SUD treatment. Aligned with these research aims, my career goal is to be an independent
researcher focused on the design, implementation, and testing of culturally specific interventions to reduce HIV
prevalence and other health disparities for racial/ethnic minorities with SUD. The training goals of this K23
Mentored Patient Oriented Career Development Award that will assist me in meeting my long-term goal are: 1)
Develop advanced knowledge of the mechanisms within intersectionality and social determinants of health that
influence sexual risk behavior for racial/ethnic minorities, 2) Increase knowledge in qualitative and mixed
method research methodologies, 3) Obtain training in the development of technology-based interventions that
target health behavior change among racial/ethnic minorities SUD, 4) gain knowledge in clinical trial design for
culturally specific interventions, and 5) Participate in professional development activities, improve grant writing
skills, and increase scholarly writing and dissemination. The research in this proposal will complement the
proposed training activities that I plan to complete at the University of California, San Francisco and will
provide me with hands-on training with my proposed mentorship team."
10849556,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT – Curation and Informatics Component
The proposed project aims to establish a bioinformatics component within the Special Mouse Strain Resource
(SMSR) program at The Jackson Laboratory by taking advantage of advances in genomic technologies for
resource development and operations. By developing a pangenome resource that incorporates diverse strain
chromosomal assemblies and variant sets, the SMSR will enhance its strain resources, improve genetic
quality control operations, and support the research community in their use of these strains for genetic
analysis of complex traits and disease modeling. The project will involve the implementation of computational
tools, data curation, and management approaches, as well as the creation of an interactive portal for users to
explore the pangenome and compare it to the human reference genome. Through these efforts, the SMSR will
expand its user base, and enhance its own operational and research capabilities, in alignment with the NIH
Strategic Plan for Data Science and data management policies."
10850071,"Applied Research -Summary / Abstract
This proposal seeks continued funding for the Tetrahymena Stock Center to build the research capacity of the
community of scientists that use this resource, by designing custom research materials for use in genetic
studies. These activities center on two specific aims: 1) Promote future studies with Tetrahymena by
developing and displaying new gene expression and mutation datasets on Stock Center informational
resources. Our rationale for this approach is two-fold: first, the rapidly decreasing price of DNA sequencing
technology makes new data-driven approaches very affordable; and second, recent improvements to
Tetrahymena Genome Database (TGD) (such as the upgrade of the genome browser to JBrowse2) make it
possible to offer analysis assistance to Stock Center users. Furthermore, because our resources are widely
used in undergraduate classrooms to engage students in guided research experiences, we are obligated to
offer resources that allow the next generation to train in data sciences. We will identify existing useful gene
expression datasets deposited in NCBI databases for curation and visualization on the TGD genome browser.
In addition, we will generate RNA-Seq data from key life cycle stages or growth conditions to fill in missing
information. We will make these data accessible at TGD and on the WashU epigenome browser, a cutting-
edge, genomic data visualization resource. In addition to gene expression data, we will use sequencing
technologies to identify genes mutated in a selection of mutant strains with striking phenotypes. This will allow
us to improve our resource curation by linking gene to phenotype with the hopes of stimulating new research.
2) Optimize gene knockout strategies for the strain engineering services offered by the Stock Center.
As part of our function as a full-service resource center, the Stock Center creates a variety of genetic mutant
strains for members of the research community. We will generate standardized workflows with predictable
outcomes and time lines for the completion of custom gene knockouts in Tetrahymena. This will allow us to
communicate more transparently and effectively with the patrons of this service. Overall, these enhancements
to resources and practices will have the key outcome of ensuring that the Tetrahymena Stock Center can meet
the research needs of both established and young investigators as they strive to make significant discoveries
using ciliates."

This Phase II Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) proposal aims to sustain and enhance an
interdisciplinary research Center within the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) focused on fundamental molecular
and cellular signal transduction mechanisms within the cardiovascular system. Our COBRE is unique, as there
are no existing centers or institutes with a focus on basic cardiovascular research within the State of Nevada.
The unifying scientific theme of the COBRE is the discovery and characterization of novel molecular and cellular
signaling mechanisms that regulate the cardiovascular system in health and disease. This research mission is
significant because cardiovascular diseases remain the leading causes of death and disability in the US and
much of the world. COBRE-sponsored research programs develop deep insight into the basic molecular and
cellular signaling mechanisms that regulate cardiovascular function, thereby accelerating the rate of discovery
of new treatments for common cardiovascular diseases and ultimately improving human health. The primary
function of Phase II is to provide mentoring and support for the COBRE’s Research Project Leaders (RPLs), a
group of three promising early-stage investigators, with the goal of developing them into fully established
research scientists funded by independent Research Program Grants (RPGs), such as an NIH R01 or equivalent.
The COBRE will continue to improve the research infrastructure at UNR by maintaining and enhancing two
research cores—the Transgenic Animal Genotyping and Phenotyping Core (Core B) and the High Spatial and
Temporal Resolution Imaging Core (Core C)—to serve the needs of the RPLs and the wider research community.
Phase II of the COBRE will lay the groundwork for the long-term sustainability of the Center by increasing the
number of RPG-supported investigators within cardiovascular theme at UNR and by promoting collaborations
among these investigators to stimulate the development of new multi-PI R01s and Program Project Grants. Dr.
Scott Earley, Professor of Pharmacology, is the Principal Investigator and COBRE Director. Dr. Earley is an
accomplished investigator with an established track record of NIH funding and publication in high-quality journals.
Additional scientific leadership will be provided by a group of outstanding established investigators with common
interests in ion channels, localized Ca2+ signaling, intracellular signal transduction pathways, transgenic animal
models, endothelial cell function, epigenetics, novel cell surface receptors, neuronal cardiovascular control,
localized signaling domains, and excitation/contraction coupling in cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells.
Successful completion of the objectives of Phase II will maintain and enhance the Nevada COBRE in
and Cellular Signal Transduction in the Cardiovascular System as a sustainable multidisciplinary
Molecular

Center with a critical mass of investigators working within this thematic focus."
10847625,"The renewal of the “Multi-Disciplinary Training in the Biology of Alcohol Use and Abuse” pre- and postdoctoral
training program at Wake Forest University School of Medicine will continue support for five predoctoral and three
postdoctoral trainees. Our objectives remain to broadly train interdisciplinary and independent alcohol
researchers who have a strong appreciation for the molecular, cellular, neurobiological, and behavioral aspects of
alcohol use and abuse. To achieve these objectives, the training faculty utilizes an array of state-of-the-art-
technical approaches and models that include in vitro systems, rodents, nonhuman primates, and human
subjects. Integration of these across the program exposes trainees to diverse, translational research experiences.
Our training faculty also have a strong history of productive mentorship with both predoctoral and postdoctoral
scientists. Their collective expertise, along with the highly-collaborative nature of our training environment,
together serve as the specific rationale for the proposed training. The overall design of the training program
incorporates robust didactic experiences, intensive laboratory training, and extensive professional development
activities that include ethics, teaching experience, grant and manuscript writing, extramural didactic/practical
training, and outreach to the lay public. These are supplemented by a training environment characterized by
numerous seminar programs, journal clubs, and data clubs that are all either directly focused on or tangentially
related to alcohol research. As a condition for appointment/reappointment, all trainees are required to present
abstracts at national meetings, publish peer-reviewed manuscripts, and apply for individual training support
through the NIH, NSF, or private foundations. These professional development activities all sharpen the skills
required for a diversity or post-training positions including both academia and research-related careers. We also
hope to limit the number of support-years each trainee receives to help ensure the brightest, most productive
trainees are appointed to the program. Using these administrative and training approaches, along with an
energetic training faculty, the program has a long history of past success and has trained numerous, nationally
recognized researchers. The proposed training will take place in the Department of Physiology & Pharmacology
within Wake Forest University School of Medicine. The department is well-known for its focus on drug and alcohol
abuse research, providing a remarkably diverse and modern training environment for the program. The institution
is likewise dedicated to the training of the next generation of scientists and hosts a number of professional
development activities that both compliment and synergize with the proposed training. Our preceptors, the
applicant pools, program design, and environment together produce a one-of-a-kind opportunity for the training of
the next generation of alcohol researchers."

Toxicology (MST) provides a multi-disciplinary research mentorship program centered around training in systems
toxicology including genomics/epigenetics, proteomics, and metabolomics as well as molecular approaches to
understand underlying mechanisms of toxicity. The T32 training program is housed under the multi-institutional
Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Sciences graduate programs which are based within the Department of
Pharmaceutical Sciences, Skaggs School of Pharmacy, but which includes faculty from the Schools of Medicine
and Public Health on the Anschutz Medical Campus and also includes faculty from National Jewish Health. The
MST training program successfully trained 9 PhD students from 2019-2023. For renewal of the MST T32 training
program, we are requesting 3 predoctoral positions/year for 2 years of support (in years 3 & 4 for a total of 15
predoctoral trainees over 5 years). The University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus MST training program
is be supported by 18 faculty which are focused on systems toxicology research and are listed as mentors on
this T32 application. This training program has the primary goal and responsibility of developing predoctoral
students into independent and successful environmental health scientists with expertise in systems toxicology.
This goal will be achieved by utilizing: 1) internationally recognized, well-funded research mentors in systems
toxicology; 2) outstanding institutional support from the UC Anschutz campus; 3) targeted didactic learning
approaches; 4) training in responsible conduct in research, grant writing and career development; 5) continued
excellence in recruitment and enhancement of diversity; 6) continued student engagement in research, education
and career development through various programs; 7) continual development of systems toxicology related
coursework and experiences; 8) evaluation metrics to continually improve the MST training program. Ultimately,
we expect our trainees to develop into independent scientists with the knowledge and skills to address challenges
in toxicology and environmental health using cutting edge `omics' and `big data' approaches."

Neuroimaging technology such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) is critical to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD) studies. In spite of the wide consensus that the integration of neuroimaging and data science approaches offers a powerful tool for understanding the underlying disease mechanisms and developing personalized treatment strategies for AD / ADRD, we are facing the urgent challenge of a capable workforce with computational neuroimaging skill-sets, due to the lack of early exposure to high-quality, hands-on research education experiences in the imaging-based AD / ADRD studies. To address this challenge, we form an inter-disciplinary team of data scientists and AD / ADRD experts to develop a summer research education program on computational neuroimaging for NIA expanding research in AD / ADRD (ERA). Specifically, our education program consists of four inter-connected components. First, we will design a hybrid curriculum of computational neuroimaging for high school students that includes a set of synchronous/ asynchronous short courses covering research ethics, imaging physics, biomedical image processing, statistical inference, machine learning, and AD/ ADRD clinical applications. Second, we will develop a collection of hands-on tutorials to train the students how to formulate the AD / ADRD question into a well-posed computational problem, how to analyze neuroimaging data, and how to translate the computational tools into clinical applications. Third, we will build a cloud-based neuroimage processing platform with the integrative functions of visualization, analysis, and data management/ sharing, which allows us to deliver the computational power to every student in this research education program. Lastly, and primarily, we will manage a project-based mentoring plan to offer each student a one-to-one open research exploration opportunity with AD / ADRD experts in UNC, Duke, and Wake Forest University during the summer program. We will work with the academic mentors to continue the training for motivated high school students by tracking the project progress, providing career advice, and evaluating the training performance. Under the umbrella of AD / ADRD research, we will partner with two NIH-funded Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) at Duke/UNC and Wake Forest University. We will also align our education program with the existing renewed STEM programs at North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics and North Carolina Science & Engineering Fair to engage high school students with diverse scientific and cultural backgrounds and develop a research outreach plan for including underrepresented groups in the biomedical science to the NIH AD / ADRD portfolio. The success of the program is built upon the unique neuroimaging, data science, and education expertise of the PIs (Drs. Wu and Kaur) and their collaborative relationships with experts in computer science, biostatistics, psychiatry, neurology, and radiology research faculties. The synergistic integration of research, mentoring, and outreach will enthusiastically engage more prospective students in AD / ADRD research, contributing to a collaborative research environment in the nation."

We are requesting funds to purchase a Zeiss LSM 980 confocal fluorescence microscope with
Airyscan 2. This instrument combines super-resolution, fast scanning, and high signal-to-noise
imaging modes that will greatly expand the imaging capabilities at the University of Rochester’s
High Content Imaging Core (HCIC). Access to the instrument will be made available to a user
base that extends throughout the University of Rochester. Many research topics at the
University of Rochester encounter questions that cannot be answered with conventional
confocal microscopy due to the diffraction limit on resolution, the bleaching rates of scarce
fluorophores, high phototoxicity, or a combination of these factors. Over the past 15 years, a
variety of innovative super-resolution techniques have been developed that allow optical
microscopy to explore details below the diffraction limit. However, techniques that boost
resolution typically come with a cost in speed (e.g. single molecule localization microscopy
(SMLM)) and/or phototoxicity (e.g. simulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy). These
costs can be too high for many biological applications. Airyscan is a super-resolution technique
that has become popular in recent years because it offers improved resolution (~2x increase)
along with higher temporal resolution and lower phototoxicity relative to conventional laser
scanning confocal microscopes. This technology would therefore provide enormous benefit to a
wide range of ongoing projects at the University of Rochester. We have established an initial
user group comprised of researchers from across the University of Rochester River Campus.
These scientists span a diverse set of research interests that cover cutting edge areas of
quantitative biology including cell differentiation, phase separated DNA condensates, functional
genomics, the molecular basis of aging, and cell trafficking. The Zeiss LSM 980 with Airyscan 2
is an ideal resource to support these investigators and future researchers in advancing the
goals of their NIH-funded research."
10834953,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is a neural crest-derived malignancy that accounts for approximately 15% of pediatric
cancer deaths. Importantly, NB arises from a failure of sympathoadrenal progenitors to differentiate.
Furthermore, the degree of tumor differentiation strongly correlates with NB outcome, as the most
undifferentiated tumors are predictive of poor overall survival. We have recently identified a novel pathway that
is capable of restricting NB differentiation, and this pathway involves de-regulation of the histone chaperone
CHAF1A (chromatin assembling factor-1A). CHAF1A is a major epigenetic and transcriptional regulator and its
aberrant expression has recently been linked to tumorigenesis in numerous cancers. We found that high
CHAF1A expression strongly predicts poor NB survival and an undifferentiated phenotype. Importantly, we show
that CHAF1A is necessary for in vivo tumor establishment and growth, restricts NB differentiation, and rewires
distinct metabolic programs. Thus, our guiding hypothesis is that NB remains frozen in a highly undifferentiated
state in part due to CHAF1A-mediated suppression of differentiation programs and metabolic reprogramming.
Our working model is that by blocking CHAF1A functions, we can drive NB to differentiate. The specific aims of
this proposal will test these hypotheses and determine: 1) the contribution of CHAF1A to NB resistance to
differentiation therapy, 2) the molecular mechanisms through which CHAF1A blocks NB differentiation and
reprograms tumor metabolism, and 3) how CHAF1A metabolic reprogramming alters NB tumorigenesis and
response to differentiation therapy. We expect to uncover the molecular mechanisms by which CHAF1A opposes
NB differentiation and to identify genes and pathways that alter tumor metabolism in CHAF1A-driven
tumorigenesis. We expect that the proposed research will also more generally provide new insight into the
transcriptional regulation of NB differentiation and energy metabolism in NB progression and resistance to
therapy. These studies will be significant as these findings will lead to develop novel differentiation therapies for
NB."
10834956,"Project Summary/Abstract
KCNQ channels are members of a conserved family of voltage-gated potassium channels. KCNQ2 through
KCNQ5 subunits are expressed in the nervous system, where they regulate neuronal excitability. Epilepsy,
autism, and other neurological conditions have been associated with mutations in the KCNQ channel genes
expressed in the nervous system. Although evidence supports the expression of KCNQ channels both in
neurons and in glia, the role of these channels in glial cells is still unknown. In this study, we use C.
elegans to investigate the physiological function of KCNQ channels in glia and the consequences of glial
KCNQ pathogenic mutations. Using RNA sequencing we have found that the amphid glia, a pair of glial cells
that encapsulate sensory neurons in the amphid sensory organ, express KCNQ worm homolog kqt-
2. Preliminary behavioral and Ca2+ imaging experiments suggest reduced GABA release from glia of kqt-2
knockout and glial knock down worms. Importantly, expression in amphid glia of human KCNQ2 and KCNQ3
genes rescue the kqt-2 knockout phenotype, supporting conservation of function across species. Thus, our
preliminary results suggest that glial KCNQ channels may be needed in glia to dampen neuronal activity via
GABA release. In this application we will test this hypothesis through the following 3 specific aims: 1) To
establish to what extent the function of glia and neurons is altered in kqt-2 knockout; 2) To determine the
physiological properties of KCNQ channels in glia; and 3) To establish the consequences of glial KCNQ
pathogenic mutations on glial and neuronal structure and function. Our findings suggest a paradigm shift:
neuronal output is regulated not only by neuronal KCNQ channels but also by glial KCNQs. Our work will
shed light on the underlying mechanism of this regulation and will determine the contribution of pathogenic
glial KCNQ mutation to the expression of the phenotype."
10840833,"Among the costliest diseases to society, and with rising prevalence in an aging population, neurodegenerative
diseases pose a public health challenge. However, there are few options available for their treatment, and
without pathomechanisms being sufficiently elucidated, one's ability to generate a rationale for interventions is
greatly limited. Our studies are expected to address this barrier by establishing new etiological factors and
molecular mechanisms of mammalian neurodegeneration. One such mechanism is Ribosome-associated
Quality Control (RQC), that mediates the degradation of incomplete polypeptides produced by ribosomes that
stall during translation. Key factors working in RQC are the Ltn1/Listerin E3 ubiquitin ligase and its partner,
NEMF (Rqc2 in yeast). PI Joazeiro has previously found that Ltn1 mutation causes neurodegeneration in mice.
PI Cox has more recently identified two independent mutations in mouse Nemf causing motor neuron disease
and used this to knowledge to identify previously undiagnosed patients with a similar neuromuscular condition
that inherited causative mutations in the human NEMF gene. In several ways, Ltn1-ENU and Nemf-ENU mice
phenocopy each other, thus strengthening the connection between RQC dysfunction and neurodegeneration.
The proposed studies are aimed at understanding molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration
caused by NEMF loss of function. We focus our analyses on a recently-discovered activity of NEMF that is
conserved from bacteria to humans–the modification of aberrant nascent chains with C-terminal Alanine tails
that have a proteolytic function. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that NEMF-mediated Ala tailing
protects neurons against degeneration. Results of these studies are expected to provide critical understanding
of how defects in protein quality control lead to neurological disease."
10841576,"Project Summary:
Offspring of obese mothers are more likely to develop asthma, although the exact molecular mechanisms that
determine this relationship remain unclear. We recently have developed a mouse model of maternal obesity that
recapitulates metabolic abnormalities seen in offspring seen in humans. Despite being fed solely a regular diet,
offspring of obese mother developed hyperinsulinemia, airway epithelium hyperinnervation and reflex airway
hyperresponsiveness. Changes in both parasympathetic and sensory nerves are believed to contribute to this
hyperresponsiveness. We have previously reported that hyperinsulinemia reduces M2 muscarinic receptor
function on airway parasympathetic nerves causing increased acetylcholine release and potentiating
parasympathetic nerve-induced bronchoconstriction. It also has been reported that insulin promotes neurite
outgrowth, and we have previously shown that increased sensory innervation correlates with disease severity in
patients with asthma. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that intrauterine exposure to maternal
obesity increases airway innervation and subsequent airway hyperresponsiveness in an insulin-
dependent manner. In this project, we will characterize changes in airway neuronal structure and function,
neurotransmitter expression, as well as the role of insulin in these changes, by testing the following three specific
aims. First, we will test the effect of maternal obesity on airway sensory and parasympathetic nerve function in
offspring. Second, we will test the effect of maternal obesity on neuronal architecture, neurotransmitter content
and M2 receptor expression in nerves of the offspring. Finally, we will determine the role of insulin in airway
hyperresponsiveness and hyperinnervation in the offspring of obese mothers. This project uses cutting edge,
innovative techniques developed in our labs and will significantly increase our understanding of the mechanisms
of asthma in adult offspring of obese mothers, which will guide us to develop new strategies for specific
prevention and treatment in this population."

 Carbenes are versatile reactive intermediates capable of engaging in cycloaddition, bond insertion,
rearrangement, and coupling reactions. Previous efforts to develop catalytic variants of carbene transfer
reactions have largely focused on the use of diazoalkanes. The primary limitation of this approach is that
diazoalkanes generally must be stabilized with electron-withdrawing or aryl groups in order to avoid the
spontaneous, exothermic elimination of dinitrogen gas. The overarching goal of this program is to study
transition metal catalyzed reductive carbene transfer reactions that use readily available gem-dihalo reagents
as precursors to non-stabilized carbenes. Catalytic turnover can be achieved using chemical reductants, such
as metal powders. Alternatively, the use of photoredox or electrocatalytic reduction makes these reactions
compatible with emerging flow synthesis platforms.
 A broad scope of catalytic cycloaddition reactions will be developed. A particular focus will be on
generating odd-membered rings, which are challenging to access by conventional thermal pericyclic
processes. For example, transition metal catalysis will allow current limitations of the Simmons–Smith reaction
to be addressed, such as the enantioselective synthesis of dimethyl-, spiro-, and methylenecyclopropanes.
Asymmetric [4 + 1]-cycloadditions of vinylidenes and 1,3-dienes will generate complex cyclopentene
derivatives. Finally, three-component [n + m + 1]-cycloadditions will be developed for the synthesis of five- and
seven-membered carbocycles and heterocycles. Some of these reactions will use dinuclear metal catalysts,
which provide a unique active site environment to mediate carbene and vinylidene transfer reactions.
 Transition metal-catalyzed additions of vinylidenes to alkenes can also be diverted to non-cycloaddition
pathways by intercepting metalacyclic intermediates prior to ring closure. Reaction design is based on
promoting β-X elimination or transmetalation reactions of these metalacycles. Based on this concept, novel
carbon–carbon coupling reactions will be developed for the synthesis of chiral alcohol and amine products.
 The catalysis concepts developed in this project will impact human health by providing access to complex
C(sp3)-rich frameworks that can be incorporated into biological probes and therapeutics."

Modern neuroscience demands breadth of knowledge as well as quantitative rigor. The goal of this program is
to satisfy the needs for rigorous literacy in experimental design, data analysis and quantitative methods applied
to neuroscience, with the purpose of training generations of responsible, ethical, inclusive students who will
become tomorrow’s innovators. Carefully designed mini courses, workshops and laboratory rotations will support
trainees in developing a deep understanding of the power and limitations of different experimental approaches
and in the appropriate use of statistics. Specialized courses will raise awareness of biases in data analysis and
provide strategies for reducing the negative effects of bias on the interpretation of experimental results. The
activities proposed here are based on active learning pedagogy and will support trainees in developing the skills
they need for successful careers in neuroscience related fields, be it in academia, industry, or other enterprises.
In addition to core courses and laboratory rotations, the curriculum includes two new experimental design and
data analysis courses, a course aimed at training students in grant writing and reviewing, and scientific
communication courses and workshops offered by the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science here at
Stony Brook University. Mentor/mentee workshops will facilitate the establishment and maintenance of rewarding
and productive mentoring relationships as students advance to the completion of their degree and develop a
long-term career plan. Such comprehensive training will prepare trainees to meet the demands of their
experimental work during their doctoral degree with confidence, supported by committed mentors and by a
program that fosters a diverse and inclusive training environment. A tight network of alumni, together with career
development resources at the institution, will place trainees graduating from this program at a competitive edge
for a variety of careers in STEM disciplines.
The program will provide financial support for 6 trainees per year starting on year 1 of the proposed funding
period. Additionally, 6 trainees will be supported in their second year during years 2 – 5, for a total of 12 supported
predoctoral trainees from year 2-5. Eligible students will be selected for support by an appointed committee.
Financial support will be awarded for 1 year, renewable for the second year based on trainees’ standing and
progress. Program activities will be open to all students in the program, currently a total of 51 trainees. The goal
of this plan is to engage faculty with expertise in new approaches to experimental design and data analysis to
bring quantitative training in signal processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence into neuroscience
experimental design and data analysis, to expand recruitment and increase the number of participating trainees."

The overall goal of this project is to replace the current micro computed tomography (micro-CT) at Nova
Southeastern University (NSU) which is near to end of its life with a more advanced robust micro-CT, to
provide accurate and efficient analysis of mineralized tissue as well as vascular structure to the investigators,
accelerating and enhancing the research efforts at NSU and nearby institutions. Micro-CT has become an
indispensably robust equipment for 3-dimensional imaging of bones, teeth and vasculature. The currently used
micro-CT, production of which was discontinued by the manufacturer, may permanently stop working at any
time, placing the ongoing projects in a dire situation, most of which are funded by the NIH. Most of major and
minor users of micro-CT who have laboratories in the Center for Collaborative Research (CCR) belong to one
of four distinctive colleges of osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, dental medicine, allopathic medicine, in the
Health Professional Division, or in Guy Harvey Oceanography Center at NSU. In this resubmission, we are
joined with additional two major users from the neighboring Florida Atlantic University and University of Miami
(Total of 7 major users and 7 minor users). Those researchers propose their need for the new micro-CT
system in the field of bone regeneration, cancer biology, oral/craniofacial skeletal biology, HIV, antibiotic
resistance, aging associated bone lytic diseases, and oceanographic research. The new micro-CT system will
facilitate investigators at NSU to thrive in their research programs, as well as catalyze more internal and
external collaborations, while serving as an attractive feature for recruiting more research faculty. It will be
maintained as a core facility in CCR, and users will receive assistance from the designated operator and CCR
staff for instrument usage and data analysis. The well-versed experts in using micro-CT at NSU will ensure that
the new system will be fully utilized and well maintained. The Vice President of Research at NSU and Dean of
College of Dental Medicine (where four of the seven major users are affiliated with) fully support the proposal
and has agreed to provide full institutional support for the maintenance service, in addition to the retention of
currently designated operator's time, for at least 5 years. The oversight committee composed of in- and out-of-
house members will ensure the sufficiently efficient operation and use of the new micro-CT. The price of the
instrument $412,365.11, includes the micro-CT instrument with 3D analysis software, computers for
reconstruction and data analysis, and initial installation and training. In summary, based on 1) the well-justified
need of micro-CT for research at NSU, 2) extensive expertise with micro-CT technology, 3) the established
solid administrative structure and oversight committee for the core management, and 4) full institutional
commitment to maintain the micro-CT, this award will be a worthwhile investment that serves the missions of
the NIH and NSU."

 For most solid tumors, high-quality surgery represents the greatest potential for cure. While many cancer
quality improvement efforts have focused on screening and diagnostic processes or timely delivery of adjuvant
therapies, relatively little attention has been paid to cancer surgery technical quality. To address this gap, the
American College of Surgeons (ACS) published 134 operative standards across 15 cancer types. Operative
standards attempt to define critical elements of optimal cancer surgery that can be used as a quality assurance
tool for practicing surgeons. The Commission on Cancer (CoC) recently implemented six of these standards
for accreditation, and hospitals are expected to reach 80% adherence by 2024. As the CoC accredits >1400
hospitals serving >70% of incident cancer patients, this program potentially impacts up to one million patients
annually. There are several mechanisms by which operative standards may improve outcomes, but other
scenarios may lead to no effect or a false outcome signal. Operative standards could improve technical quality
through behavioral mechanisms such as clinician education, the Hawthorne effect, or audit and feedback.
Additionally, as many standards are directed at lymph node evaluations for cancer staging, standards may
improve staging and appropriate delivery of adjuvant therapies. On the other hand, operative standards may
fail to improve cancer outcomes if they are directed at technical components already performed at high rates,
at components not directly impacting outcomes, or if they target outcomes with low event rates. Finally, the
reporting of some standards will rely on self-assessment by the operating surgeon. In this case, operative
standards may fail to improve outcomes if the surgeon incorrectly assesses the standards without a change in
technical quality. Understanding whether the current slate of operative standards improves outcomes is critical.
Well-designed standards have the potential to reduce technical variation and improve quality. In contrast,
ineffective standards would place costly and unnecessary administrative burdens on clinicians and CoC
hospitals, potentially distract clinicians and hospitals from other high-quality care, or lead to more extensive
surgery that does not benefit patients. We propose to evaluate the impact of six CoC operative standards on
short-term cancer outcomes by leveraging a natural experiment—the implementation timeline planned by the
CoC, scheduled CoC site visits to assess for implementation of the standards, and pre-existing data collection
by the National Cancer Database (NCDB). To fully evaluate the relationship between the CoC operative
standards and outcomes, we will employ a CoC Special Study to collect cancer recurrence outcomes not
currently collected by NCDB. Further, we propose to evaluate implementation outcomes, including resource
burden across diverse CoC sites that potentially explain any observed heterogeneity in implementation or
effect."
10842880,"Project Summary/Abstract: Epigenetic biology associates with inherited cellular cues to define
diverse cell fates with the same genome. Among essential epigenetic events is protein methylation
deposited by more than 60 human protein methyltransferases (PMTs) and recognized by hundreds
of effectors to render downstream functions. Because many methylation events are invisible in
cellular contexts for conventional methods, our understanding of epigenetic roles of protein
methylation is very limited. In the past five years, our laboratory has focused on developing novel
chemical biology technologies and implementing them to annotate novel methylation events and
their downstream outcomes. We plan to continue this research theme for technological, functional,
and conceptual advances. Regarding the technological advance, we envision developing a
collection of complementary chemical biology tools to annotate each PMT-target-effector axis in
the context of the complex methylome. For potential functional and conceptual advances as
supported by our preliminary data, we will characterize nonhistone and noncanonical histone
methylation events associated with transcriptional regulation and protein homeostasis. The
completion of this proposal is expected to reveal the molecular mechanisms of multiple protein
methylation events in their biologically relevant contexts."

Sequencing of genetic and epigenetic variants associated with disease states has revealed that ATP-
dependent chromatin remodelers are among the most frequently disrupted genes in a number of diseases. In
mammals, BAF (SWI/SNF), PBAF, and GBAF complexes are highly conserved ATP-dependent chromatin
remodelers that generate accessibility for DNA-templated processes. Although these complexes have well-
documented roles in many contexts, the mechanisms by which BAF-family complexes are regulated by specific
signals remains poorly understood. Additionally, accessible sites across the genome respond with extreme
heterogeneity to remodeling by these complexes, yet the basis of this heterogeneity, the physical origins of
remodeling specificity, as well as the effects on transcription after initiation remain largely unknown. Improved
understanding of these principles would provide powerful opportunities to manipulate gene expression in
normal and disease states. To address this challenge, we will develop and combine new tools in epigenetics,
chemical biology, and microscopy. We will make use of rapid technologies to manipulate BAF activity in living
cells using cell-permeable molecules, and measure the outcomes using sensitive, unbiased approaches,
including epigenomics and live-cell microscopy. We will use these tools to answer essential questions about
ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling specificity, including: (1) How are BAF (SWI/SNF) complexes regulated
via cellular signals? (2) Why do sites respond differently to chromatin remodeling? (3) How does chromatin
remodeling influence transcription after initiation? Revealing the fundamental mechanisms used by these
factors holds great promise to enable powerful intervention strategies for diverse human diseases."

 Enhancement of Optometric Education with Basic, Applied and Clinical Research
Abstract
The T35 Training Grant titled, Enhancement of Optometric Education with Basic, Applied and
Clinical Research, seeks to afford qualified Optometry Interns the opportunity to pair with
experienced research faculty to conduct basic, applied, clinical and translational research at the
University of the Incarnate Word Rosenberg School of Optometry (UIWRSO). Objectives
include (a) Faculty-Intern research committed to early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of
ocular disease as well as basic and applied research which enhance our understanding of visual
function leading to improvement of vision in normal and abnormal populations (b) inspire
Interns to pursue postdoctoral research and academic activities and positions paving a course
toward academic and research careers (c) foster collaboration with other UIW programs (Schools
of Medicine, Pharmacy, Physical Therapy, Nursing, Math, Science and Engineering and
Biomedical Sciences) as well as institutions and industry sharing common goals. The rationale
for our proposal is predicated on our success with our Summer Fellowship Training Program
(SFTP), active since 2011, allowing Interns to participate in faculty supervised research during
the summer between first and second professional years. The SFTP has been highly successful
yielding 17 peer-reviewed papers and 60 peer-reviewed poster and paper presentations at major
meetings comparable to or exceeding major schools and colleges of optometry funded with T35
grants. While the SFTP is largely internally funded, previously supplemented by industry and a
grant to increase diversity in optometric education, it closely mirrors current T35 programs, and
we hope to continue our success. We propose that a T35 grant support four Interns per year for
8-week summer periods for a duration of five years."
10826398,"Project Summary / Abstract
 The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in various aspects of host health, including resistance against
pathogen colonization. Phages, viruses that infect bacteria, can impact the composition and function of the gut
microbiota, leading to changes in gene expression, metabolic activity, and/or acquisition of novel traits. Our
research focuses on how phages interact with the gut microbiota and influence infection outcomes, specifically
in the context of Vibrio cholerae (Vc) infection, the causative agent of cholera. We have determined that
differences in gut microbiota-mediated bile metabolism are key factors in personalized outcomes of Vc
infection. As Vc uses bile in the gut to regulate its virulence gene expression during infection. The gut
microbiota, particularly the Bacteroidota, can modify the bile pool via enzymes called bile salt hydrolases
(BSHs), which converts bile acid molecules from those that strongly induce Vc virulence to weakly inducing
forms, thereby disrupting the regulatory cascade of Vc. We have also found that phage infection in
Bacteroidota can lead to significant changes in gene expression, including the repression of a sensory protein
(TspO) that regulates BSH activity, resulting in increased ability to deconjugate bile acids and reduce Vc
colonization. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that phage infections in closely related strains and
species of Bacteroidota lead to conserved changes in gene expression, disrupting Vc colonization through up-
regulation of BSH activity, while other genes regulated by TspO increase vulnerability to Vc competition. To
test our hypotheses, we will (Aim I) track phage mobilization in gut microbes using fluorescent protein
reporters and characterize the effect of phage on BSH activity in new hosts. We will also (Aim II) investigate
the consequences of commensal phage on Vc infection using mutagenesis and co-colonization experiments,
to identify the genetic determinants responsible for Vc antagonism of Bacteroidota without phage. These
studies will provide valuable insights into the role of commensal phages in modifying gut bacterial bile salt
sensing and deconjugation, and contribute to our understanding of how phage-mediated processes can be
harnessed for prophylactic interventions against gastrointestinal pathogens such as V. cholerae. Further
understanding of the interactions between phages and the gut microbiota will enable the development of
strategies to manage and potentially engineer the effects of phage-mediated processes on community
dynamics and host health. Overall, our research sheds light on the complex interplay between phages, gut
microbiota, and host-pathogen interactions in the context of Vc infection, with potential implications for
personalized medicine and interventions against infectious diseases."

Lasso peptides are bacterial metabolites characterized by a unique knotted configuration that confers thermal
stability, proteolytic resistance, and potent target affinity in biological applications. Known lasso peptides have a
diversity of biological functions, including as antibiotics. In terms of modification for drug development, they are
recognized for their ability to be engineered via epitope grafting and genetically encoded libraries. However, the
lack of a viable platform to produce lasso peptides has hindered the discovery and development of lasso-based
drug leads. Chemical synthesis of lasso peptides is impeded by the lasso fold, positioning microbial production
as a favorable alternative. However, heterologous expression of lasso peptide gene clusters (most commonly
using E. coli as the bacterial host) results in low yield (<15 mg/L). In an experiment to test the expression of the
model lasso peptide capistruin in an alternative Burkholderia bacterial host, a stochastic overproducer clone was
identified. Preliminary investigation into the underlying molecular mechanisms of capistruin overproduction led
to the recapitulation of high yield capistruin production (up to 130%) by way of plasmid copy number modulation.
Production of capistruin with this alternative Burkholderia host corresponds to a yield 800-fold greater than that
reported for production using E. coli. Our production platform was validated when Burkholderia was employed
to express an orphan gene cluster from the endosymbiont Mycetohabitans sp. B13 (Burkholderiaceae), leading
to the discovery of two lasso peptides. The objectives of this proposal are to further establish an effective
production platform for novel lasso peptides while simultaneously deepening our understanding of the molecular
determinants of compound overproduction by the Burkholderia host."
10826924,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
Ozone (O3) is a harmful air pollutant that exacerbates chronic lung diseases in part by activating inflammatory
responses, inducing lung injury, and inhibiting resolution mechanisms. Resolution mechanisms are mediated
largely by specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs). SPMs are potent bioactive molecules that inhibit immune
cell recruitment, downregulate pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, and upregulate
phagocytosis of apoptotic cells – a resolution process termed ‘efferocytosis’. We have previously reported that
O3 decreases SPM production and inhibits efferocytosis, potentially contributing to exacerbated and persistent
inflammation observed in patients with pulmonary diseases exposed to O3. SPMs are metabolized primarily from
ω-3 fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA can be consumed through diet or, more commonly
in western cultures, synthesized from the essential fatty acid α-linolenic acid by elongation of very long-chain
fatty acids protein 2 (ELOVL2). Preliminary data in this proposal indicates that DHA concentrations and ELOVL2
expression increase in the lung tissue following O3 exposure. Furthermore, ELOVL2 is increased in alveolar
macrophages (AMs) after O3 exposure, suggesting an immunological need for endogenous DHA in AMs. When
exogenous DHA was supplemented through diet, the O3-induced pulmonary and AM driven inflammatory
responses were reduced, AM efferocytosis was augmented, and markers of lung injury resolved faster.
Additionally, similar findings were noted when mice were pretreated with DHA derived SPM intermediates that
correlated with an increase in the SPM maresin 1 (MaR1) in lung tissue. MaR1 is a unique SPM that is primarily
produced by monocytes and macrophages that binds to leucine rich repeat containing G protein-coupled
receptor 6 (LGR6) to facilitate resolution processes. To examine MaR1 signaling following O3 exposure, we
measured LGR6 expression on AMs and found it to be significantly reduced when pulmonary inflammation was
ongoing. Taken together, these data indicate that endogenous DHA in AMs leading to MaR1 signaling may be
a crucial pathway to resolving O3-induced lung injury and inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesize that
endogenous DHA synthesis in AMs is required for production of MaR1 which reduces the severity and
improves resolution of O3-induced lung inflammation . To test this hypothesis, we will: 1) Examine how
endogenous DHA synthesis via ELOVL2 in AMs reduces O3-induced pulmonary inflammation and promotes
resolution responses, and 2) Determine if DHA-derived MaR1 signaling induces a pro-resolving AM phenotype
through LGR6, mitigating pulmonary inflammation and promoting resolution following O3 exposure. Completion
of the proposed aims and training included in this proposal will prepare the applicant for a successful career as
an independent investigator and will equip him with cutting edge techniques, a strong network of mentors, and
didactic training required for a successful career in academia."
10826975,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in mammalian development, cellular differentiation, and disease, with
5-methylcytosine (5mC) being the most well-studied epigenetic modification. 5mC globally represses gene
expression and has significant gene-regulatory importance in various diseases. The ten-eleven translocation
(TET) family of enzymes can oxidize 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which is a stable marker of global
transcriptional activation. While previous studies have characterized the role of 5hmC modifications in healthy
human tissues and evaluated plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) for its biomarker potential in various malignancies,
urine cfDNA has not yet been studied. Urine represents a non-invasive, easily collectible, and proximal biofluid
to a number of GU diseases. At present, it is unclear how urine cell-free DNA (cfDNA) 5hmC profiles reflect
normal physiological conditions and mirror the composition of neighboring tissues. Researchers wonder whether
urine cfDNA 5hmC profiles might offer a superior alternative to plasma cfDNA, the current gold standard in liquid
biopsy, in the diagnosis of GU cancers like bladder cancer. To address these questions, this proposal seeks to
characterize the genome-wide 5hmC landscape of healthy urine and develop biomarkers in the setting of
localized bladder cancer. The proposal aims to achieve these objectives through two specific aims. The first aim
focuses on identifying sources of unwanted variation, characterizing the genomic and epigenomic 5hmC
landscape, and inferring the tissue-of-origin of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) derived from healthy urine samples. To
accomplish this aim, a bioinformatic pipeline will be optimized for processing 5hmC profiles from urine cfDNA.
The 5hmC regulation in urine cfDNA will be characterized by analyzing its activity on gene bodies, promoters,
enhancers, and various regulatory epigenomic regions. This aim also proposes the creation of tools to determine
the tissue-of-origin of urine cfDNA and confirm its enrichment for GU tissues compared to plasma cfDNA,
highlighting the applicability of urine cfDNA in GU contexts. The insights gained from Aim 1 will provide a
reference for evaluating the deviations in 5hmC distribution in urine cfDNA in various cancer and non-cancer
disease states. The second aim focuses on developing robust diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for localized
bladder cancer. The study will demonstrate the utility of urine cfDNA 5hmC-profiles in bladder cancer diagnosis
and treatment surveillance and compare its performance to plasma cfDNA 5hmC profiles. Additionally, a multi-
omics classifier model incorporating 5hmC, copy number, and targeted mutational data will be created and
validated for predicting minimal residual disease in bladder cancer patients who underwent curative-intent
bladder removal surgery. The results from Aim 2 will generate 5hmC signatures that can be used to predict the
onset of localized bladder cancer and to predict minimal residual disease. Ultimately, the data from Aim 2 could
deliver a set of new gene and enhancer targets that maybe serve as exciting therapeutic targets for prevenation
and treatment of bladder cancer."
10837678,"Protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is indispensable for the life of the cell and constantly chal-
lenged by physiological demands and environmental stressors. When the homeostasis of ER protein folding is
perturbed, a potentially lethal condition, known as ER stress, is ignited. To mitigate ER stress, a set of con-
served ER membrane-associated sensors prioritizes the production of ER foldases and disposal of chronically
misfolded proteins. When these adaptive responses are insufficient, the UPR activates pro-cell death process-
es. Due to its critical housekeeping roles, the UPR is essential during growth of multicellular organisms and
insufficiency leads to harmful conditions in humans, including diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cancer.
For decades the UPR has been studied mainly in vitro, in unicellular model organisms and in differentiated cell
lines, which can survive UPR insufficiency or are unable to recapitulate the complexity of whole multicellular
organisms. Because of this, the design of effective medical therapies targeting UPR-associated diseases re-
quires whole-body UPR models where it is possible to develop a mechanistic understanding of the impact of
the UPR in growth, stress resistance and pro-death decisions.
My long-term research goal is to develop an evolutionarily distinct model system with unique advantages for
uncovering the UPR in a whole-body context to formulate a comprehensive understanding of this essential sig-
naling pathway in vivo. Towards this goal, our research addresses fundamental knowledge gaps of the UPR in
the plant model species Arabidopsis thaliana, because of the conservation of plant and metazoan UPRs and
the vast genetics and genomics resources that we have developed and leveraged to study the UPR in whole-
body context. Moving forward, we will build upon our exciting new findings, which support the existence of
novel signal transduction pathways depending upon the conserved UPR sensors in growth and stress, as well
as newly identified effectors of ER stress-related cell death in conditions of unresolvable ER stress in vivo.
Specifically, we will focus on 1) the role of protein phosphorylation changes depending on the most conserved
UPR sensor, the protein kinase and ribonuclease IRE1, in growth and ER stress mitigation; 2) the characteri-
zation of novel non-redundant effectors of cell death discovered through a whole-body forward genetics
screen, and 3) the mechanisms which underlie the unique signal transduction pathways of the conserved UPR
transcription factors. These efforts will 1) define new non-conventional mechanisms that modulate ER stress
response; 2) identify critical cell fate effectors with a functional relevance for unresolved ER stress survival in
vivo, and 3) expand the frontiers of the understanding of UPR signal transduction at the intersection with other
biological pathways operating in a whole-body system. In the long term, our research will contribute to the
knowledge of the UPR at the cellular level and significantly advance our understanding of the UPR in vivo, thus
overcoming bottlenecks in formulating effective therapeutics to ameliorate human conditions linked to the UPR."

Dysfunctions in mitochondria and mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (MAM) are
associated with the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Mitochondrial protein, CHCHD10, plays a pivotal role in governing various mitochondrial functions, including
respiration, genome stability, dynamics, cristae organization, and oxidative phosphorylation. In our preliminary
study, CHCHD10 declines in the brains of APP/PS1 mice and human AD patients, which negatively correlates
with Ab levels. Restoration of CHCHD10 in APP/PS1 mice reduces AD pathogenesis in vivo. In transfected cells,
wild-type CHCHD10 promotes mitochondrial respiration as well as mitophagy and autophagy via PINK1/Parkin
and p62/LC3 pathways. In addition, increasing CHCHD10 mitigates MAM hyperactivity in AD. We have identified
specific small DNA oligos (antagoNATs) derived from CHCHD10 natural antisense transcripts (NATs) that
effectively augment CHCHD10 levels in both mouse and human cells. Our preliminary study shows that
CHCHD10 antagoNATs increase endogenous CHCHD10 protein both in vivo in mice brains and in vitro in human
cell lines. This study has two principal objectives: (1) to evaluate the therapeutic potential of CHCHD10
antagoNATs by assessing their protective effects on these phenotypes in APP/PS1 mice and human neurons,
and (2) to delineate the intricate interplay between CHCHD10, MAM, and mitophagy, thus elucidating their
collective role in ameliorating AD pathogenesis.
Successful conclusion of this study will: (1) facilitate the CHCHD10 antagoNATs as a therapeutic strategy for
AD; (2) provide a mechanistic basis and insights into CHCHD10-associated mechanisms in AD."

Arteries and veins play different roles in human physiology and vascular diseases. Notably, arterial and venous
endothelial cells (ECs) demonstrate distinct molecular profiles. The establishment of such molecular distinction
is orchestrated by series of transcriptional programs, which have been well studied in developmental biology.
However, how these EC transcriptional programs control adult blood vessel structure and function, and how to
translate this knowledge into clinical application such as vein or tissue engineered graft adaptation is under-
explored. To address this question, we examined the transcription profile of arterial vs. venous ECs in adult
blood vessels and have identified several key transcription factors that are differentially expressed in arterial
vs. venous ECs. Among them, Sox13 and Sox17 are highly expressed in adult arterial ECs but not in venous
ECs. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that over-expressing Sox17 in venous ECs reconstitutes all the
known arterial markers, suggesting Sox17 is a key regulator of adult arterial EC phenotypes. Importantly,
Sox17 induces the expression of multiple families of molecules (Notch, Ephrin, Connexins, PDGF) that may
confer signals from ECs to smooth muscle cells (SMCs) to regulate SMC phenotypes in blood vessels. EC
Sox17 also promoted SMC contractile phenotype in EC-SMC co-culture and graft remodeling model. On the
other hand, over-expressing Sox13 in ECs facilitates the recruitment of SMCs toward blood vessels. Based on
these encouraging preliminary data, we hypothesize that endothelial Sox13/17 play synergistic roles in the
homeostatic regulation of adult artery functions by maintaining adult arterial EC phenotype and engaging EC-
SMC crosstalk. To test this hypothesis, we will investigate how the endothelial Sox13/17 regulates EC and
SMC phenotypes and their role in blood vessel structures and functions using in vitro bioengineered models as
well as in vivo animal models."
10855741,"Bladder cancer (BC) accounts for 80,000 new cancer diagnoses and 20,000 deaths annually in the US. Recent
large-scale studies have comprehensively mapped the genetic landscape of BC, yet the median survival for
patients with metastatic BC is only 14 months. Therefore, there is an urgent need for mechanistic studies
informed by new genomic data to define the role of specific alterations in BC biology and guide novel therapeutic
strategies. Aberrant activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a common feature of
cancer, and ~20% of bladder tumors harbor MAPK activation driven by RAF1 (CRAF) amplification or an
activating HRAS mutation. Peroxisome proliferator activating receptor gamma (PPARG) is a nuclear receptor
and transcription factor that regulates lipid and glucose homeostasis. PPARG also has an important role in
urothelial cell differentiation and a subset of BCs have genomic PPARG alterations leading to increased PPARG
signaling and an immune-excluded, luminal-like phenotype driven at least in part by changes in NFkB-mediated
gene expression. We recently found that MAPK and PPARG pathway alterations co-occur in a subset of BCs
and the central hypothesis of this proposal is that aberrant MAPK and PPARG signaling cooperate to drive the
unique phenotype of these MAPK/PPARG-altered tumors. Furthermore, we hypothesize that targeting MAPK
signaling with novel MAPK-directed agents such as RAF dimerization inhibitors will provide dual therapeutic
benefit by directly inhibiting oncogenic MAPK signaling as well as by restraining PPARG signaling, thereby
promoting immune infiltration and increased sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibition. In Aim 1, we will dissect
the signaling interplay between MAPK and PPARG by measuring the effects of MAPK pathway modulation on
PPARG phosphorylation and activation state as well as on PPARG and luminal gene expression programs in
MAPK/PPARG altered and non-altered BC cell line and patient-derived models. We will also define the
transcriptional networks that orchestrate MAPK-PPARG signaling in BC cells. In Aim 2, we will investigate the
impact of MAPK pathway activity on NFkB-mediated cytokine signaling and macrophage properties in BC
models. We will test whether MAPK signaling in BC cells drives macrophage polarization via direct or paracrine
mechanisms and we will define the impact of MAPK pathway perturbations on BC cytokine gene transcription.
In Aim 3, we will investigate the combined activity of MAPK inhibition and immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) in
multiple MAPK/PPARG-altered immunocompetent BC models. We will measure treatment effect on tumor
growth and survival and will define the impact of MAPK pathway inhibition on immune contexture. Finally, we
will investigate the association among PPARG signaling, MAPK signaling, and treatment outcomes in ICI-treated
and untreated clinical BC cohorts. Together, these integrated studies will define the mechanism(s) through which
MAPK pathway activity regulates the unique tumor cell intrinsic and immune microenvironmental features of
MAPK/PPARG-altered BC, potentially informing novel therapeutic approaches for this subset of BCs."

 The core objective of the pre-doctoral Developmental Biology Training Program (DBTP) is to produce
highly qualified, independent research scientists who are trained to take a broad interdisciplinary approach to
developmental biology problems. This mission is consistent with the philosophy of the University of Chicago’s
Biological Sciences Division (BSD), which seeks to avoid artificial boundaries between disciplines and
encourage broad based interaction and collaboration.
 To produce researchers trained in a variety of areas relevant to human health and disease, the DBTP
builds on both long-standing and burgeoning University of Chicago strengths in developmental biology. We
have well-established strengths in the genetics of model organisms, the molecular and cellular basis of
development, computation/modeling/systems level approaches in developing systems, and evolutionary
developmental biology. During the ongoing third funding period, strategic new hires have enabled the DBTP to
expand in areas of developmental neurobiology, stem cell biology, and biophysical approaches to
development, and through affiliation with the MBL to exploit a wider array of non-traditional models. The DBTP
trainers are a vibrant group of thirty-four well-funded researchers, including experienced senior faculty and
talented junior faculty, based in eight BSD departments, the adjacent Chemistry department, the Pritzker
School of Molecular Engineering, and at our affiliate organization the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL).
 DBTP trainees are carefully selected from six interdisciplinary graduate training programs: training
grant support begins as they enter their second year of studies and generally extends for two years, subject to
competitive renewal. We propose to continue to support four trainees in year 1, and then increase that number
to five trainees in years 2-5 to take advantage of the expanding pool of students with interests in our new joint
graduate program with the MBL. This number of trainees will allow us to be highly selective, while maintaining
a critical cohort size.
 Trainees benefit from a strategically designed curriculum that includes access to six dedicated formal
courses, a unique new lab-based Embryology course at the MBL, a requirement for quantitative/computational
training, and an extensive range of supplemental training-related activities. Among these activities are the
DBTP sponsored developmental biology seminar series and data club (associated with our required
communications course), an annual retreat, and student-run DBTP-sponsored symposia. Our training plan
ensures students develop broad transferable skills—including communication, networking, teaching,
computation, and rigorous critical analysis—key to their success in the biomedical research workforce. In
summary, the DBTP integrates a range of training approaches to prepare future leaders in developmental
biology research and education. The success of the DBTP is demonstrated by our funded tenure-track alumni."

Although typical scRNA-seq or scATAC-seq data contain 5-25% of reads that map to the mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) genome, such mtDNA mapped reads are often filtered out or ignored during downstream analysis. The
mitochondria generate over 90% of the cellular energy and are central to health and disease. mtDNA mutations
directly cause mitochondrial disease. In addition, random somatic mtDNA mutations accumulate with age and
are associated with a broad range of aging-related diseases such as immune disorders, cardiovascular disease
and neurodegeneration. However, little is understood about whether accumulation of specific mtDNA variants
during aging occurs at the same rate across different cell types, organs, age, gender and race. Such insights
would substantially improve our understanding of how mtDNA mutations contribute to various human diseases.
Accordingly, significant gaps of knowledge in the single-cell biology field include the lack of robust mtDNA
analysis tools and how to utilize the rich mtDNA information often neglected in the ever-increasing datasets to
obtain new biological insights. We propose to address these knowledge gaps by: (1) develop robust mtDNA
analysis workflows and tools integrated with the HuBMAP Portal; (2) systemically analyze mtDNA from single-
cell datasets generated by HuBMAP and other resources; (3) determine whether and how prevalent human
mtDNA variants impact mitochondrial and cellular function."

Cell transplantation, using GABAergic interneurons that integrate in host brain circuits, and function similar to
endogenous inhibitory neurons could offer a novel therapeutic alternative for intractable epilepsies. Our work,
over the past two decades, demonstrated that GABAergic progenitor cells derived from murine embryonic medial
ganglionic eminence (MGE) integrate into host circuits (following transplantation in neonatal or adult mice),
where they make functional inhibitory synapses, efficiently suppress epileptic seizure activity, and correct
behavioral comorbidities associated with epilepsy. To establish an alternative source of MGE progenitor cells
that would facilitate translation of this disease-modifying transplantation strategy to larger species, we recently
established protocols using porcine embryonic MGE progenitor cells. Building on these findings, two specific
aims are proposed: (i) to optimize intra-hippocampal xenotransplantation of porcine embryonic MGE progenitor
cells and (ii) to evaluate the range of therapeutic benefits possible with porcine embryonic MGE progenitor cells.
Techniques will involve cutting-edge electrophysiology, optogenetic and calcium imaging methods (in vitro and
in vivo) to study functional integration of MGE-derived interneurons. Video-EEG monitoring, rodent epilepsy
models, sophisticated behavioral assays, and confocal microscopy techniques will also be applied. Our results
promise to provide new information about porcine MGE progenitors and direct demonstration(s) of the potential
for xenotransplantation as a treatment for intractable epilepsies."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is projected to become the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related
deaths world-wide by 2030, largely due a lack of effective treatments. A major barrier to successful therapy is
the abundant fibrotic reaction in PDAC, which includes cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). While many
pancreatic tumors are hypovascularized, endothelial cells regulate immune maturation and infiltration, tumor cell
metabolism, and metastatic dissemination. In PDAC, SLIT-ROBO signaling was recently identified as frequently
mutated. There have been contradictory genetic and pharmacologic studies in mouse models, indicating the role
of SLIT-ROBO signaling in PDAC is highly complex and context dependent. Our preliminary data indicate that
SLIT2 inhibits angiogenesis in human endothelial cells in vitro. Previous work showed that epithelial Slit2 deletion
promotes neural invasion and metastasis in PDAC. However, we find the majority of Slit2 is produced by
fibroblasts, while Robo receptors are expressed in endothelial cells. This proposal aims to uncover two key
aspects of SLIT-ROBO signaling in PDAC: a) fibroblast secreted SLIT2 (Aim1) and SLIT3 (Aim2) -dependent
impacts on the PDAC TME. In Aim 3 of this proposal, I will determine the fibroblast-specific contribution of dual
SLIT2 and SLIT3 deletion in primary human CAFs to angiogenesis and tumor cell growth using a novel
multicellular co-culture approach. Overall, the proposed experiments will provide a new understanding of
the SLIT-ROBO dependent cellular cross talk within the pancreatic TME."

 Of the several metabolic and immunological privileges that the brain enjoys, autonomy in cholesterol
regulation is one of the important features. This privilege is afforded by the presence of the blood brain barrier
(BBB) that is composed of a monolayer of brain microvasculature endothelial cells (BMVEC) which have
cholesterol-rich tight junctions (TJ). It is not known if the central nervous system or the vasculature provides
cholesterol to the BMVEC. Recent studies show that apolipoprotein E (apoE)-null mice display severely
increased BBB permeability, which is aggravated with aging. ApoE is polymorphic with apoE3 considered anti-
atherogenic and apoE4 associated with risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Both serve as ligands for lipoprotein
receptor mediated endocytosis thereby lowering plasma cholesterol. We hypothesize that apoE plays a critical
role in maintaining the integrity of the BBB in an isoform-specific manner by providing cholesterol to the TJ in
BMVEC. In parallel, we propose that age-related oxidative stressors impair the ability of apoE to mediate the
function of supplying cholesterol thereby compromising the BBB integrity.
 To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will evaluate the isoform-specific role of apoE in maintaining the BBB
integrity using polarized BMVEC as mono- or co-cultures with astrocytes secreting apoE3- or apoE4- high
density lipoprotein (HDL). They will be treated with apoE3 or apoE4-HDL with fluorescent cholesterol supplied
from the basolateral or apical sides and cell associated fluorescence visualized by fluorescence microscopy
using TJ markers and quantified by flow cytometry. TJ complexes will be captured by immunoprecipitation to
quantify levels of TJ markers and cholesterol. Lastly, cellular internalization of cholesterol will be evaluated to
determine if there are preferred uptake routes via the LDLr family. In Aim 2, the effect of oxidized apoE3 and
apoE4 on uptake and TJ integrity will be followed, with additional focus on scavenger receptors that play a role
in internalizing oxidized lipoproteins. This is relevant since heightened oxidative stress is considered one of the
hallmarks of aging. In Aim 3, the apoE isoform- and oxidative stress-related alterations to the proteomic and
lipidomic profiles of TJ complexes will be determined by mass spectrometry. It allows us to develop an
interactome map and identify candidate proteins that may be associated with the aberrant behavior of apoE4.
 A diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students will be involved from experimental design to data
collection and analysis, manuscript preparation and conference presentations. An HSI, CSULB has seen a
transformative change in research culture after ~10 years of the NIH Building Infrastructure Leading to
Diversity (BUILD) initiative. It is well suited to engage a large number of students from diverse backgrounds in
meaningful research leading to careers in biomedical sciences. Employing innovative and inter-disciplinary
approaches, findings from this proposal will provide timely opportunities to identify potential mechanism-based
intervention strategies to address AD that affects millions of aging populations in the US and elsewhere."
10850216,"ABSTRACT
Over 20% of patients discharged from the Emergency Department (ED) have unplanned revisits within 30
days, often due to preventable causes. Upon revisit, the ED physician lacks vital data on the timeline of events
and physiologic changes leading to the patient’s return, which can lead to delayed diagnosis and over-testing.
Continuous monitoring of vital signs and activity can produce detailed information about a patient’s condition
and stability, both in the hospital and after discharge. It is not known, however, which patients benefit most from
post-discharge monitoring (PDM), which monitoring signals and strategies best predict quality of life and ED
revisit risk for specific patient populations, and how PDM data can be made diagnostically useful when a
patient returns to the hospital. To address these gaps, we aim to produce a framework for the integration of
PDM and acute care to improve our understanding of ED patient trajectories, both after discharge and upon
revisit. Specifically, we hypothesize that integrating hospital data and PDM can improve the predictability of ED
revisits, identify potential targets for post-discharge interventions, and improve diagnosis and disposition of ED
revisits that cannot be prevented. We will enroll a clinically and demographically diverse cohort of ED patients
at high risk of revisit within 30 days, and configure noninvasive wearable monitors with an accompanying
smartphone app to continuously track activity and physiology after discharge. We will develop interpretable
deep learning models to predict revisits and changes in health-related quality of life, and characterize, for
specific patient populations, the monitoring signals and measurement frequencies most relevant to predicting
revisits and quality of life, and the prediction horizons in which preventive interventions could be delivered.
Finally, we will combine in-hospital and PDM data to develop and evaluate an intervisit report for the ED
physician treating a returning patient, summarizing the relevant trends in patient physiology, activity, and
health-related quality of life between visits, and including a large language model-derived interpretation of the
antecedents of the return visit. Better understanding how and for which patient populations PDM can predict
ED revisits and quality of life can improve the integration of acute and ambulatory care, identify new clinical
use cases for existing monitoring technologies, and inform the design and timing of preventive interventions.
Analyzing intervisit trajectories can reveal the antecedents of acute presentations, and improve diagnosis and
disposition upon ED revisit."

 Pattern separation is the process by which the brain distinguishes between similar or overlapping
features of the external world. This fundamental computation is performed by multilayered circuits – including
the dentate gyrus, cerebellar cortex, and insect mushroom body – that expand and diversify neural
representations. Diversity in “space” (i.e. the identities of neurons responding to a given stimulus) is achieved
by sparse and unstructured synaptic connectivity, but we currently lack an understanding of how synapses
generate diversity in time to support temporal pattern separation. This gap is due to two basic challenges: (1)
measuring dynamical properties of multiple synaptic inputs to a given neuron and (2) causally perturbing those
properties while monitoring downstream neurons and behavior.
 Here we propose to overcome these challenges, by investigating synaptic mechanisms of temporal
pattern separation in a tractable experimental system: the mushroom body of the fruit fly, Drosophila. We have
developed new methods to rapidly characterize the short-term plasticity dynamics of multiple synaptic inputs to
a single neuron, as well as genetic strategies to perturb these dynamics. This enables a systematic
examination of how synapses generate diversity over time to separate fine temporal differences in sensory
inputs. In Aim 1, we will determine how populations of mushroom body neurons use temporal diversity to
expand their sensory coding capacity. In Aim 2, we will combine 2-photon optogenetic stimulation with whole-
cell electrophysiology to examine the organization of short-term plasticity properties across the synaptic inputs
to the mushroom body. In Aim 3, we will experimentally manipulate short-term plasticity at mushroom body
input synapses to study their role in associative learning. Together, these studies will reveal synaptic and
cellular mechanisms for temporal pattern separation in the mushroom body.
 Although there are differences between flies and mammals, the basic logic of pattern separation is
strikingly conserved between circuits of invertebrates and vertebrates. These similarities suggest that
discoveries made in the fruit fly will be relevant to the mechanisms of temporal pattern separation in other
animals. A more thorough understanding of how short-term synaptic plasticity implements higher-order
computations has the potential to transform our understanding of the role of timing in learning and memory,
which could lead to improved treatments for memory-related disorders."
10831852,"Abstract
Dysfunctional angiogenesis is implicated in several pathologies that affect tens of millions of patients in the U.S.
alone. A lack of healthy vascularization can result in lethal complications, including tissue death and limb
amputation, and current solutions fail to promote stable vasculature. Therefore, there is a demand for strategies
that can support healthy vascularization throughout the angiogenic process. As high-level regulators of
angiogenesis and healing, macrophages are an attractive target for pro-angiogenic cell therapies. Intensely
responsive to environmental stimuli, macrophages have been shown to exhibit a pro-inflammatory (M1)
phenotype in early healing, then a less-inflammatory M2 phenotype dominates later stages. Although the roles
of macrophage phenotypes in angiogenesis are poorly understood, studies suggest that M1 macrophages
induce sprouting of new blood vessels, then M2 macrophages promote stabilization. In vivo, the M2 population
can derive from circulating monocytes, or from the phenotypic switching of pre-existing M1 macrophages, but it
is unknown to what extent each group is present or what they contribute to angiogenesis. We have previously
shown that IL-4 causes M1-activated macrophages to switch to an M2 phenotype with some increased
angiogenic functions, compared to IL-4-treated M0 macrophages. We hypothesize that M1-derived M2
macrophages are a unique phenotype essential to angiogenesis, and that promoting the M1-to-M2 switch with
biomaterials will enhance angiogenesis in vivo. Aim 1 will thoroughly investigate the differences between M0-
derived and M1-derived M2 macrophages in vivo using next-generation sequencing, producing the unique gene
signatures and functional phenotypes of each group. In Aim 2, PLGA microparticles will be loaded with the M2-
promoting drug simvastatin, then co-cultured with M0 or M1 macrophages to facilitate phagocytosis. The
macrophages will then be injected into a murine model of wound healing, and as the microparticles degrade and
release simvastatin, the drug will promote M2 polarization intracellularly. It is expected that the group undergoing
the M1-to-M2 transition will augment angiogenesis. This study will increase our understanding of the roles of
macrophage phenotype during angiogenesis, and will result in a translational pro-angiogenic biomaterials-based
cell therapy."
10831906,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Little Rock Green Schoolyard Initiative, with training and technical assistance from the National League of
Cities and the Children and Nature Network, aims to transform the grounds of two elementary schools into
nature-filled greenspaces. Using a community-schools model, several critical needs were identified. These
include: (1) opportunities for outdoor learning; (2) improved outdoor play experiences; and (3) safe, welcoming
spaces to connect with nature outside of school hours. Both schools serve low-income, predominately African
American communities. Each school is centrally located in a walkable neighborhood, but residents in these
neighborhoods have limited access to city parks within walking distance. The communities surrounding these
schools are disproportionately affected by cardiometabolic conditions linked to inadequate physical activity and
obesity. For the children, more opportunity for active learning and play may increase physical activity which
has been shown to be beneficial for cardiometabolic profiles of children and may help address obesity-related
health disparities. These health disparities are already evident in children in the two neighborhoods being
impacted by this city-led program with higher proportions of severe obesity by 4th grade (body mass index
exceeding 120% of the 95th percentile) than other schools in the city and state. The goal of this study is to
explore the pathways through which green schoolyard improvements can reduce the development of obesity-
related health disparities, as well as improve academic outcomes and community well-being. A growing
literature on the health benefits of greener environments suggests that physical activity, air quality, sleep, and
social behaviors are intertwined pathways that may protect against excess weight gain. Data will be collected
on outcomes related to these pathways before, during, and after the green schoolyard transformations from
children in the two program schools and in comparable non-program schools within the Little Rock School
District. The study is designed to understand how these pathways work in combination and whether greener
schoolyards influence patterns of play in ways that improve opportunities for physical activity among children
who are at greater risk for developing severe obesity. Community and school-level barriers to implementation
of the green schoolyard intervention will also be identified to inform future initiatives. Another strength of this
study lies in the fact that there will be different dimensions to the greenspace improvements across the two
schools. This allows for a richer understanding of how characteristics of the greenspace and differences in
implementation affect these pathways. The lessons learned from Little Rock’s green schoolyards program will
inform pragmatic and cost-effective interventions that slow the growth of severe childhood obesity in
communities across the United States and reduce obesity-related health disparities."
10831991,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is chronic and disabling; most individuals never achieve full remission,
even after acute treatment, and 50% of those who access acute treatment will relapse within 6-
months of discharge. AN relapse-prevention treatments are urgently needed that can disrupt the
persistent cycle of admission and discharge from acute treatment. Importantly, existing
treatments do not differ from control treatments in the ability to alter cognitive-behavioral AN
pathology, which is the primary remaining symptomatology at discharge from acute care. The
inability to alter cognitive-behavioral pathology is a function of the limited availability of
treatments that include skills training to promote behavior change in a “real-world” context,
outside of treatment facilities. As such, relapse-prevention treatments should explicitly target
core cognitive-behavioral pathology to facilitate approach behaviors (e.g., facing fear foods) in
the real-world. Our scientific premise, developed from our past work, is that the application of a
virtual format of Facing Eating Disorder Fears (FED-F) for AN will facilitate engagement in
approach behaviors and minimize avoidance behaviors - improving outcomes, enhancing full
recovery, and decreasing the likelihood of relapse. FED-F is a modular treatment that enhances
exposure therapy with psychoeducation and cognitive skills teaching how to face fears of (a)
food, (b) weight gain, (c) interoception/body, and (d) social situations. Our study goals are to (1)
refine and test the acceptability and feasibility of FED-F delivered post-acute treatment as
adjunctive to step-down specialty care, (2) test if this treatment outperforms treatment as usual
(TAU), and (3) to examine if treatment targets our hypothesized mechanism of action: approach
behaviors. These goals will lead to a highly deployable and accessible virtual treatment targeted
at core AN mechanisms that predict relapse. The proposed research uses highly innovative
methods; we will use an all-remote technology-based approach, combining a virtual, non-
therapist assisted treatment with remote behavioral and momentary assessment of
approach/avoidance behaviors. Specific aims are to (1) refine FED-F into a fully virtual format
with input from patients and stakeholders and collect preliminary data (N=10) on its feasibility
and acceptability, (2) conduct a small pilot RCT of FED-F (n=30) as compared to TAU (n=30),
and (3) examine if FED-F targets approach/avoidance behaviors and test if this mechanism is
associated with clinical outcomes. Ultimately, this proposal will lead to the creation and
dissemination of a highly user-friendly, easily accessible and deployable intervention, delivered
during a critical period of care, that can prevent AN relapse, which will decrease mortality,
morbidity, and the high costs associated with chronic treatment."

10833584,"ABSTRACT
Despite being the most frequent and deadly of the interstitial lung diseases (ILD), Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
(IPF) remains challenging to diagnose and treat. The diagnostic process for IPF relies on subjective
interpretations of clinical data while current antifibrotic therapies employ a “one size fits all” paradigm.
Members of our team have been at the forefront of developing `omics approaches to diagnose and define
prognosis in ILDs. Importantly, we identified the first pharmacogenomic interaction suggesting that IPF patients
with TOLLIP rs3750920 T/T genotype strongly benefited from NAC. There is a critical need for molecular
classifications that define IPF, thus allowing precision-based management. Our long-term goals are to move
ILD diagnosis and therapy into the “era of precision medicine.” In a highly innovative approach we have
partnered with the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation (PFF) Clinical Care Network (CCN) and Registry. This group
has recruited ILD patients who have provided extensive baseline phenotypic and longitudinal outcome data,
biological samples and have consented to be re-contacted for future research. Our overall objective is to
efficiently conduct a novel, precision genotype-based trial in IPF while leveraging the CCN and its unique
biospecimen collection to characterize a broad range of ILDs molecularly and identify genetic variants of IPF
risk. To address our goal of precision-based ILD management, we will complete three complementary Specific
Aims. In Aim 1 we will determine if NAC is an effective treatment in IPF patients characterized by a precision
genotype approach. In partnership with the PFF, we will identify PFF registry subjects with the TOLLIP T/T
genotype to begin randomizing 200 IPF patients followed by enrolling new subjects at the same clinical sites to
receive NAC or placebo in a double-blind fashion. This study, the “Prospective tReatment EffiCacy in IPF
uSIng genOtype for Nac Selection (PRECISIONS)” trial, will document the benefits of an innovative “precision”
genotype-specific study design of a well-tolerated and inexpensive therapy. In Aim 2 we will distinguish IPF
from non-IPF ILDs using unbiased combinations of blood transcriptomics and proteomics. We propose to
conduct RNA-seq and proteomics to characterize gene expression and protein biomarkers on the entire PFF
registry cohort. We will define “signatures” for distinguishing IPF from non-IPF ILDs. Our unbiased approaches
to `omics traits will be integrated to reveal `omics risk scores that define individual diseases, predict disease
course, and response to therapy. In Aim 3 we will identify genetic variants playing a role in IPF risk. We will
conduct whole genome sequencing of the entire PFF cohort to detect novel genetic associations for IPF and
ILD risk. With sufficient power, we will assess both common and rare/infrequent variants in comparison to
ethnically matched un-afflicted cases, and between ILD cohorts to meet our objective. This will establish the
largest collection of its kind and establish quantitative trait loci for all `omics' data. The results of our proposed
experiments will move ILD management, and IPF therapy, in particular, into the precision medicine era."
10833585,"Cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes are major public health concerns, particularly in older adults.
There are major gaps in our knowledge about diabetes and how to prevent its associated microvascular and
cardiovascular complications. In older adults, there is controversy regarding the total burden of risk associated
with diabetes and prediabetes, optimal treatment targets, and how best to reduce cardiovascular risk and
prevent cognitive and physical impairment. Novel cardiac biomarkers reflect the summation of acute and
chronic morbidity and may have utility for informing treatment decisions in diabetes and other cardiometabolic
conditions, but they have not been rigorously evaluated. To address these issues, we need junior patient-
oriented investigators who will need rigorous training and mentorship in the areas of clinical epidemiology,
translational research methods, and the conduct of large clinical studies. The candidate, Elizabeth Selvin, PhD,
MPH, has devoted her career to the study of the clinical epidemiology of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular
disease and the mentorship of trainees in this field. The continuation of this K24 award will protect the time of
the candidate for research and mentoring. The goals during this award are to recruit a team of diverse, multi-
disciplinary junior investigators who will receive mentorship in the clinical epidemiology of cardiovascular
disease and diabetes; to promote formal training in epidemiology and clinical research methods for beginning
clinician investigators; and to mentor trainees to address significant research questions in the field and help
launch their independent research careers. Dr. Selvin's large research portfolio (including three R01 grants)
will provide a rich substrate for training and new research opportunities for mentees. Dr. Selvin has a strong
track record of success in the field and in mentoring junior scientists. With continued support from this K24, she
will be able to expand her mentorship activities, strengthen her research portfolio, and recruit and train the next
generation of leaders in the field."
10833586,"Project Summary
 Craniofacial anomalies account for a third of all human congenital birth defects and significantly impact
national health care budgets. Affected individuals typically undergo multiple surgeries throughout their lifetime,
which are rarely fully corrective. Therefore, it is critical to develop therapies for improved prognosis and
prevention, but this can only come from a better understanding of the genetic and cellular mechanisms
governing craniofacial development and the etiology and pathogenesis of individual disorders. Disruptions in
neural crest cell (NCC) development are considered the underlying cause of many craniofacial birth defects.
Therefore, understanding the genetic and cellular mechanisms that regulate NCC development and their
ultimate generation of craniofacial tissue is crucial for developing preventative therapies and improved surgical
prognosis.
 Delamination from the neuroepithelium is a critical step in the formation of migrating NCC. However,
the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing NCC delamination in mammalian embryos are poorly
understood. Delamination is a biophysical process by which a cell departs its tissue environment, and my
extensive preliminary data indicates that cell extrusion may be a novel mechanism facilitating cranial NCC
delamination. This proposal focuses on cell extrusion and will broaden our understanding of NCC delamination
by elucidating the cellular and genetic systems regulating NCC delamination via cell extrusion. Aim1 will
visualize and capture the dynamic cytoarchitectural and morphological changes that drive cranial NCC
delamination in mouse embryos. Aim2 will investigate the role of Piezo1, a mechanosensitive ion channel in
cranial NCC delamination and craniofacial development. The impact of Piezo1 loss-of-function on NCC
delamination and craniofacial development will be analyzed through null and conditional genetic knock out of
Piezo1 mechanosensitive ion channels in mouse embryos. The downstream regulatory network and signaling
pathways will then be elucidated through transcriptomic comparisons measuring the differences in candidate
downstream regulators between wild type and knock out embryos. Completion of the study will advance
fundamental knowledge and further our understanding of neural crest cell and craniofacial development and of
congenital birth defects."
10833590,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Intrinsically disordered proteins and protein regions (IDPs and IDRs) lack stable tertiary structure but retain
biological function. Understanding the structure/function relationships of such disordered protein regions
presents a significant challenge because of their highly variable and dynamic nature. The past few years have
resulted in an increased awareness and recognition of the prevalence and roles of IDPs and IDRs in
membrane trafficking and organization. The primary goal of the proposed research is to advance our
understanding of how the dynamic and highly variable structure of IDPs mediates their functions in membrane
trafficking and organization. A key aspect of IDP function in membrane trafficking and organization involves
direct IDP-membrane interactions, which can occur in conjunction with disorder-to-order transitions, or in the
absence of protein ordering. Formation of membrane-binding amphipathic helices (AHs) is the most common
example of the former, but the mechanisms underlying and regulating the formation, stability, specificity and
function of such membrane-associated AHs remain poorly understood. Factors that govern membrane binding
by IDRs that remain disordered in the bound state are even less well understood. A major area of proposed
research centers on delineating mechanisms for these types of IDP-membrane interactions using the protein
complexin as a model via a combination of in vitro characterization of structure and dynamics and in vivo
functional assays. Another emerging aspect of IDP function is their ability to mediate the formation of
condensates or membraneless organelles. Recently, it has been demonstrated that IDR-containing membrane-
binding proteins can form cytosolic condensates that sequester and organize intracellular reservoirs of
membrane vesicles. The mechanisms that regulate the ability of condensates to interact with and organize
membranous vesicles or compartments have barely been explored and represent second major focus of this
proposal. The primary model system for these efforts will be the clustering of membrane vesicles mediated by
the protein synapsin, and the regulation of this clustering by IDPs and IDRs such as synucleins and rab
proteins. Efforts will also include investigating the role of condensate formation in the organization of tubulo-
vesicular organelles such as the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC). These systems will be characterized
using structure/function analyses combining in vitro characterization of condensate formation and vesicle
recruitment/release with in situ and in vivo functional studies. Achieving the overarching goals of this proposal
will serve to advance our understanding of different mechanisms that underlie the roles of IDPs and IDRs in
the regulation of membrane trafficking and organization. By focusing on specific models with physiological
significance, namely factors governing vesicle exocytosis and the formation of clustered vesicular structures in
neurons and other cell types, the results will make a significant impact on specific fields as well as broaden our
general understanding of how protein disorder contributes to the organization of cellular membranes."
10833591,"Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus occurs in the well-defined neurogenic niche in the subgranular zone of
the dentate gyrus. Newborn neurons are continuously generated and mature over the course of weeks to
integrate into the hippocampal circuit. Adult-born immature dentate gyrus cells (DGCs) have unique functional
properties that give them a privileged role in circuits that define specific behaviors, and which are critical to
episodic memory formation and retrieval. In particular these neurons play important roles in an animal’s ability
to separate similar patterns and disambiguate overlapping memories, processes that become impaired during
normal aging and in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, mechanisms that regulate
adult-born DGC maturation and integration are important in understanding diverse neurological disorders
including Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress disorders. Kainate receptors are a
class of glutamate receptor whose contributions to heterogeneous synaptic processes are still not fully
understood. The premise of these studies is built upon foundational studies in which we discovered that the
maturation of adult-born DGCs is more rapid after ablation of kainate receptors. We found that this effect was
likely through a disruption of intracellular Cl- gradient because of an effect on a neuronal Cl- transporter. We
will fully describe the altered molecular, synaptic, and functional alterations after loss of kainate receptor
signaling and will test whether GABA disruption is causal to the altered integration of maturating DGCs into the
hippocampal circuit. We will determine how altered maturation of adult-born DGCs affects the animal’s ability
to discriminate between similar patterns and temporal overlap of episodic memories and using in vivo
microendoscope imaging correlate cellular activity to behavioral measurements in a pattern separation task.
The goal of this project is to examine a new mechanism by which glutamate receptors affect adult-born DGC
integration by modulating GABA signaling. These studies would define novel processes that regulate adult-born neurons that could underlie the known involvement of kainate receptor signaling in mechanisms of
learning and memory."

10839832,"The mission of the Pharmacological Sciences Training Program (PSTP) is to train outstanding scientists in the
pharmacological sciences, enabling them to transition to any of the varied career opportunities in the U.S.
biomedical research enterprise. A highly productive and well-funded faculty provide a diversity of research areas
for trainees that builds on our traditional strengths in receptors and signal transduction, cancer and protein
kinases, and neuropharmacology with emerging areas in chemical biology, nanotechnology, genomics and
proteomics, stem cells, RNA biology, bioinformatics and systems biology. Students apply to the Biological and
Biomedical Sciences Program (BBSP), an admissions portal/first year program for 14 degree-granting
departments, an umbrella program that oversees recruitment and training of first-year graduate students in the
biomedical sciences. The BBSP admits between on average 75-90 students per year, with an increase to 100
students slated for 2019. A significant portion (20-25%) of matriculating students are underrepresented in the
biomedical sciences. Students carry out three research rotations, take a required first year course and another
course of their choosing, and, at the end of their first year, select a thesis mentor and a degree-granting PhD
program for their thesis research. Students joining the PSTP choose from 46-core faculty for their dissertation
research. A very strong Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) also brings in ~10 students per year, 0-2 of
which join the PSTP per year.
The PSTP is designed around a complementary set of training tools, including formal lecture-based courses,
seminar courses focusing on scientific communication skills, an immersive grant-writing course, and original
doctoral research. Our rationale is that by combining these training approaches, we prepare our trainees for
future success. Introductory and advanced courses in pharmacology and physiology, and elective specialized
courses are required during the first and second years. A rigorous and intensive grant-writing course develops
skills for identifying an important, innovative and tractable research question and hypotheses and formulating a
strong set of Specific Aims that test these hypotheses. Presentation courses and a student seminar series
provide students with many opportunities to hone their research presentation skills and gain confidence in public
speaking. Quantitative skills are developed through strong emphasis on biostatistics, biocomputation, and ligand-
receptor binding theory and analysis. Rigor and reproducibility are emphasized across all training opportunities.
Individual Development Plans are drafted for all students, and also are used to identify quantitative skills classes
germane to the students’ research projects. A robust advisory system oversees the thesis research years of
students. Faculty rely on evidence-based mentoring practices to best help students achieve shared goals. Based
on previous years, we anticipate that we will have 9-11 new, training grant-eligible students entering the PSTP
program each year. Students will be appointed to the training grant for a maximum duration of two years, during
their second and third year of graduate school. The average time-to-degree over the last five years for all PSTP
students, including trainees from underrepresented groups, is 5.5 years, and these students had on average 4
publications, a little less than two of which were first-author publications. Twenty-three percent of current PSTP
trainees are from underrepresented groups, and three of our current UR trainees were awarded the prestigious
HHMI/Gilliam Fellowship for Advanced Study. Our overall goal is to train a diverse cohort of future scientists by
equipping them with critical-thinking, computational, and communication skills and providing exposure to myriad
career opportunities needed to obtain a position in a scientific career of their choosing."
10857277,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Transition metal-catalyzed cross coupling reactions are among the most widely used strategies for
C—C and C—N bond formation during the synthesis of small molecules for biomedical research.
Despite their widespread use, limitations to these methods can often be attributed to poor control
over the metal's reactivity or selectivity during key elementary steps of the catalytic cycle. In
particular, problems with oxidative addition can limit the chemical space that can be accessed
through cross coupling methods. During this elementary step, a transition metal oxidatively
inserts into a bond of an electrophile (typically a carbon–heteroatom bond). Challenges related to
this step include (1) subverting conventional site selectivity when two or more identical halides
are present on aromatic substrates, (2) exploiting relatively non-labile phenol derivatives as
electrophilic coupling partners, and (3) developing selective, mild cross-coupling reactions
catalyzed by low-toxicity base metals such as iron and cobalt. This proposal seeks to develop
solutions to these challenges through a combined experimental and computational approach.
Completion of this work will help to streamline access to pharmacologically relevant compounds
through more efficient catalytic methods. Furthermore, an in-depth understanding of the
mechanistic origin of selectivity and reactivity in these systems will lay the groundwork for future
rational design of new catalytic systems."

Proposed is a five-year research career development plan focused on evaluating the role of intratumoral (IT)
administration of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 21 (CCL21)-gene modified human monocyte-derived dendritic
cells (DC) plus pembrolizumab for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The
candidate is an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Hematology/Oncology at The University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The proposal builds on the candidate’s previous translational research and
clinical experience in lung cancer immunotherapy by incorporating (1) formal training in clinical/translational
research via The Master of Science in Clinical Research Program, (2) conduct of a phase I clinical trial, and (3)
evaluation of clinical and correlative data generated on trial. Under the tutelage of his Primary Mentor, Steven
Dubinett, M.D., a successful mentor of more than 45 trainees, and strong Mentorship Committee of David
Elashoff, Ph.D. and Edward Garon, M.D, M.S., the candidate will gain the skills necessary to become an
independent physician scientist. Importantly, he also has strong institutional support to foster his development.
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Programmed cell
death-(ligand)1 [PD-(L)1] agents, such as pembrolizumab, have revolutionized treatment of the disease, but a
significant proportion of patients still do not benefit. The most commonly proposed reason for the lack of anti-
PD-(L)1 efficacy is the absence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. One potential approach to overcome this
limitation is to utilize in situ vaccination with IT injection of functional antigen presenting cells, such as CCL21
modified DCs, since this chemokine promotes (1) co-localization of lymphocytes and DCs and (2) facilitates T
lymphocyte activation. A phase I trial evaluating IT administration of autologous CCL21-DC in advanced
NSCLC patients revealed that the procedure is safe, feasible, and promotes effector T lymphocyte infiltration,
in addition to systemic immune responses. However, increased PD-L1 expression was observed in the tumor
microenvironment following IT injection, suggesting the PD-1 immune checkpoint may be forestalling a more
robust CCL21-mediated antitumor response. As a result, it is hypothesized that combined IT CCL21-DC plus
pembrolizumab will improve clinical outcomes in patients with advanced NSCLC. The aims of this proposal are
to (1) complete a phase I trial of IT CCL21-DC plus pembrolizumab in patients with advanced NSCLC and
evaluate (2) blood and (3) tumor tissue collected on trial via mass cytometry (CyTOF) and multiplex
immunofluorescence (MIF), which will be guided by the results of four additional correlative analyses planned
on trial, to further elucidate remodeling of immunologic pathways as a result of this novel therapeutic approach."

Doxorubicin (DOX) chemotherapy regimens play a prominent role in many cancer treatments. With long
term cancer survivorship, a substantial population of cancer patients remain at risk of early cardiovascular

treatment of DOX with the ErbB2 inhibitor, Trastuzumab has synergistic effects in improving the control of cancer
progression and survival in breast cancer patients, and is better than either drug alone. However, the combination
therapies with the ErbB2 inhibitor coupled with DOX cause severe and aggressive form of heart failure. To
overcome this clinical problem, we propose a novel combination therapy with PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil (Viagra)
and mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin in preventing the severe cardiotoxicity caused by DOX and DOX with sequential
use of Trastuzumab in breast cancer-bearing mice. We will evaluate the therapeutic effect of sildenafil and
rapamycin on DOX-induced cardiomyocyte death in vitro and cardiac function in vivo. In addition, we will
determine the role of inflammation in the development of cardiotoxicity by measuring the expression of TLR4,
NLRP3 and pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and IL-18. The role of cGMP-dependent protein kinase
G (PKG) activation and mTOR inhibition with associated downstream signaling pathways in protecting against
DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction will be studied. We will also investigate the effect sildenafil and rapamycin
treatment in potentiating the anti-tumor efficacy of DOX and DOX with Trastuzumab and improvement of cardiac
function in the clinically relevant mouse models of spontaneous and orthotropic breast cancer. Furthermore, we
will determine the effect of sildenafil and rapamycin in attenuation of hypertrophy in cardiac specific ErbB2
transgenic mice. Because sildenafil and rapamycin are clinically approved drugs, the proposed studies may help
in developing novel combination therapy for treatment of thousands of cancer patients experiencing the lethal
and debilitating cardiotoxic effects of DOX and Trastuzumab worldwide."
10850204,"Project Summary – High Spatial and Temporal Resolution Imaging (HSTRI) Core (Core C)
The goal of the present proposal is to maintain and enhance a High Spatial and Temporal Resolution Imaging
Core (HSTRI) research core (Core C) that offers a wide array of state-of-the-art instruments enabling
visualization of cells and tissues samples pharmacologically or genetically labeled with fluorescent indicators.
With the assistance of expert staff and unrestricted access to these instruments, greatly enhanced the
competitiveness of Research Project Leaders (RPLs) in Phase I, and we will provide the same services to RPLs,
pipeline investigators, and Pilot Project leaders in Phase II. This facility is specifically designed to meet the needs
of our RPLs but will also enhance the overall capacity for biomedical research at the University of Nevada, Reno.
Core C will accomplish the following Specific Aims during Phase II of the COBRE: Specific Aim 1: To operate
and expand a facility providing state-of-the-art high spatial and temporal resolution imaging
methodologies for studying cellular structure, signaling pathways, and function in health and disease.
Recent advances in microscopy have produced a new generation of commercially available instruments that
enable biomedical researchers to investigate the relationships between structure and function in biological
systems with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. The main goal of this Specific Aim is to continue
making advanced imaging modalities available to COBRE investigators and to the larger UNR community of
researchers. Specific Aim 2: To continue advising, training, and informing investigators in the use of the
new technologies. Training users in the operation of HSTRI Core equipment and appropriate sample
preparation, as well as educating them about the scientific possibilities offered by these technologies, is crucial
to maximizing the Core’s impact on research and for achieving long-term self-sustainability. Core personnel will
continue to provide appropriate training and supervision of users, manage the logistical challenges associated
with accommodating multiple research projects, and offer workshops on novel microscopy and imaging
approaches. Specific Aim 3: To expand the userbase and devise an operational plan that will sustain the
long-term viability of the Core. Plans were already implemented during Phase I and will continue to be
developed to provide support for the Core after the end of the funded period through a business plan of revenues
that includes user fees and institutional support. As was the case for Phase I, HSTRI Core services will continue
to be offered to investigators directly associated with the COBRE (Research and Pipeline Project Leaders, and
Senior COBRE investigators) and non-COBRE investigators at times not reserved by COBRE investigators.
Notable in this latter context, many well-funded laboratories at UNR Med and UNR, including non-biological labs
in Engineering, have begun utilizing the infrastructure to incorporate high-resolution imaging methods in their
research and grant applications."

Project Summary
The Appalachian Training Program in Occupational Health and Safety at West Virginia
University (WVU) serves a critical need to supply qualified occupational health and safety
professionals for our state and region. Our specific goal is a practical one: to train professionals
who understand hazardous workplaces and who are prepared to serve in a “front-line” capacity
to prevent, mitigate, and manage workplace injuries and disease in a rural context. We
emphasize the recruitment and training of graduates who will be committed to remain within the
Appalachian region. The Appalachian Training Program in Occupational Health and Safety
provides Master's level training in Industrial Hygiene (IH), both Master's and Doctoral-level
programs in Occupational Safety and Health Engineering (OSHE), and an Occupational
Medicine Residency (OMR) for physicians. Although this is not an Education and Research
Center (ERC), it is one of only three NIOSH-supported Training Project Grants to offer multiple
programs. The OMR has been supported by NIOSH since 1988, the IH program since 1980
and the OSHE program since 2005.
It is difficult to overstate the importance of these programs to Appalachia, defined by the
Appalachian Regional Commission as a 205,000 square-mile area with approximately 25 million
people extending from southern New York to northern Mississippi. This is the only OMR in the
entire region, and there are only two other NIOSH-supported programs providing training in IH
and OSHE. Not only do these programs serve critical regional needs for qualified occupational
health and safety professionals, but this grant helps connect programs based within the
Benjamin M. Statler College of Engineering and Mineral Resources to those of the Robert C.
Byrd Health Sciences Center (HSC) and form the nucleus around which larger activities are
built, such as broader educational outreach, research, clinical service, workplace evaluation and
control efforts, and national/international faculty recruitment and retention. All three programs
benefit not only from the resources of a large, land-grant university but a close relationship with
all three Divisions of NIOSH-Morgantown, currently the only such facility in the country located
on a university campus and adjacent to the HSC."

The proposed research project continues and expands our investigation of the interaction of thrombin with the
anticoagulant protein C responsible for a key feedback regulation of the coagulation response. The project
addresses unresolved issues in the field using an innovative structural approach and plans to fill existing gaps
in basic knowledge about protein C as a substrate of the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex and activated
protein C as an enzyme that inactivates factor Va. Unraveling the architecture of multidomain factors involved in
blood coagulation, complement and fibrinolysis remains a challenging task because of the difficulty of obtaining
high resolution structures. This limitation is even more acute when considering complexes involving these factors
and their macromolecular substrates or activators. Our approach addresses this challenge directly with cryo-EM,
the new gold standard for the structural investigation of biological macromolecules. Building on our recent
success in solving the structures of human coagulation factors V and Va, the proposed research project plans
to revolutionize the structural enzymology of protein C in a way that is relevant to other multidomain proteins and
their complexes in the blood coagulation cascade. Toward this end, we have obtained preliminary cryo-EM
structures of protein C free and bound to the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. Once fully refined as planned
under aim 1, these unprecedented structures will unravel the mechanism of protein C activation and test the
hypothesis that thrombomodulin promotes the interaction of thrombin with protein C by offering a scaffold that
changes their conformation and alleviates electrostatic clash. In addition, we have obtained a preliminary cryo-
EM structure of activated protein C free and prepared stable particles of activated protein C bound to factor Va
and protein S for cryo-EM data acquisition. Progress from these studies will elucidate how the structure of
activated protein C compares to that of its zymogen form and will further refine the mechanism of protein C
activation. Furthermore, direct information on the epitopes of recognition of factor Va will enable a structure-
based engineering of variants of activated protein C with altered specificity for potential therapeutic applications."
10850469,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT – Metabolic & Analytic Core
Diabetes (DM) is a global epidemic and the state of Hawaiʻi is especially afflicted as the ethnicities that compose
its population are particularly susceptible. Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and Asians who constitute a
majority of the population in Hawaiʻi are twice as likely to develop DM as Whites. Recognizing the lack of
dedicated infrastructure to study the mechanisms of DM in humans as well as in cellular and animal models, the
Phase 1 of the COBRE has established a Diabetes Research Center (DRC) at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa
(UHM) John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM). The COBRE-Diabetes has developed a Resource Core
that supports the career development of young investigators and promotes DM-related research. In the five years
of the Phase 1 COBRE we have established a dedicated Center and mentored 7 multidisciplinary RPLs from the
JABSOM, Cancer Center, and College of Engineering. The Phase 1 Core has promoted the growth of DM
research in Hawaiʻi by successfully graduating 7 RPLs and supporting 7 Pilot Project Leaders. We are now
developing a critical mass of investigators required to lead our school through the COBRE Phase 2, as a Center
for biomedical sciences with a Pacific focus through enhanced educational and training activities.
In this Phase 2 application, we propose to sustain and improve the Core by expanding the services it provides,
acquire new equipment, improve sustainability via the cost center, and continue DM-related research and
development to support both human and animal studies. The Core will directly support the evolving needs of our
new COBRE RPLs and Pilot Projects Leaders. Project 1 consists of developing novel non-invasive skin
microfluidic devices to monitor DM complications related biomarkers. Project 2 will investigate the
genetic underpinnings of cerebrovascular disease in Native Hawaiians. Project 3 will study the molecular
mechanisms of DM-mediated cardiac autonomic dysfunction in a rodent model. The goals of the Metabolic and
Analytic Core (MAC) of this Phase 2 COBRE will be achieved through the following specific aims: 1) Enhance
the MAC by expanding services for the growing number of investigators interested in DM and 2) Provide genomic
services and access to in silico analysis of variation associated with DM. The MAC will continue to support the
goal of our COBRE grant, to create a sustainable resource for the local scientific community conducting
meritorious research in DM and its’ complications at UHM and in Hawaiʻi.

Mount Sinai's Training Program in Social Neuroscience Research will offer late-stage predoctoral (PhD) students
and early-stage postdoctoral fellows an integrated program of training in social behavior research that builds on
vast expertise in translational neuroscience, neurology, psychiatry, and genomic sciences. The overarching goal
of the program is to provide rigorous, broad-based, individualized, and multidisciplinary training with enhanced
opportunities for mentoring, collaboration, and career development designed to prepare the next generation of
independent investigators in social behavior research, particularly as it relates to neuropsychiatric syndromes.
At the heart of this new Training Program will be a superb training faculty representing remarkable diversity in
basic and clinically-relevant topics, including social behavior disturbances in psychiatric and neurological
diseases; molecular and synaptic mechanisms of social behavior; and developmental disorders of social
function. The training program comprises seven inter-related components: academic coursework, laboratory
training, non-curricular training activities (seminars, retreats, etc.), testing/evaluation, teaching opportunities,
mentoring, and career development activities. Varied laboratory opportunities at Mount Sinai take advantage of
strengths in translational neuroscience, computational neuroscience, neuropsychiatric genomics, neuroimaging,
epigenetics, and synaptic and behavioral plasticity and provide opportunities for the study of diverse model
systems. The Training Program includes more than a dozen opportunities either newly created or building on
existing opportunities to create sharp focus on training in social neuroscience relevant to neuropsychiatric
disease, to emphasize multidisciplinary collaborations, and to foster and promote exceptional rigor and creativity.
Pre-and-postdoctoral trainees will participate in a range of required and optional training activities to ensure
strong grounding in basic neuroscience and opportunities to learn from and with peers and faculty from across
the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, the medical school,
interdisciplinary Centers and Institutes, central among them the Friedman Brain Institute), as well as from other
institutions. Creating a structure for, and culture of, mentoring across the continuum of the Training Program is
a key component of the program; formal and informal advising and mentoring will be integrated into training
across roles and levels, including mentoring opportunities for training faculty and sponsors (preceptors).
Integrating predoctoral and postdoctoral training through formal mechanisms will provide greater continuity in
the overall training experience, enhanced opportunities for collaboration among trainees interested in pursuing
careers in mental health research, and will benefit the neuroscience research effort at Mount Sinai. The Training
Program in Social Neuroscience will prepare the most promising trainees for productive, independent careers in
social neuroscience research through a training program that both promotes rigor and nurtures innovation."

This proposal requests support for a new animal MRI scanner magnet and gradients to replace the original
equipment that was destroyed in a recent untimely and unexpected magnet quench. After replacing the
magnet and gradients, the Animal MRI Core will again have a state-of-the-art system that supports research
from NIH-funded investigators representing four IDeA State institutions in the Midwest: University of Kansas
Medical Center, University of Kansas-Lawrence, Kansas State University, and Pittsburg State University. The
upgraded system will also support the research initiatives of seven NIH-funded centers: University of Kansas
Alzheimer’s Disease Center, University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kansas Intellectual & Developmental
Disabilities Research Center, University of Kansas Polycystic Kidney Disease Research & Translation Core
Center, Frontiers: University of Kansas Clinical and Translational Science Institute, and two CoBRE Centers
(Kansas State University Cognitive and Neurobiological Approaches to Plasticity Center and Kansas Center for
Metabolism and Obesity Research.
Our user group includes >20 NIH-funded investigators who have adopted MRI methodology to answer
complex biomedical questions in neurological, renal, pulmonary, and hepatic disease and through studies in
neurodegeneration, metabolism, obesity, pain, and developmental biology. With this scanner, these
investigators will have access to high-performance electronics that will provide many new acquisition
sequences for data acquisition and an intuitive graphical user interface based on clinical MRI scanner designs
which is more user-friendly to operators, thus opening access to a wider user group including graduate
students and post-doctoral fellows since their training period will be dramatically shorter. Accordingly, we
anticipate reduced imaging costs to investigators funds.
This system will be installed in the University of Kansas Medical Center Hoglund Biomedical Imaging Center. It
will be supported by strong institutional commitments to operating costs and an outstanding team of imaging
scientists who will collaborate with our Major and Minor Users on study design, imaging protocol development,
analysis of data and interpretation of results. We expect this system to quickly and dramatically increase in
research activity at the University of Kansas Medical Center as well as in the nearby region."

The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway promotes animal fertility by protecting the germline genome against
mobile DNA elements. Despite this well-established paradigm, several critical gaps remain in our understanding
of piRNA mechanisms, including the sexual dimorphism of their biogenesis and downstream gene regulatory
functions. We discovered that the ancient SNAPc (or SNPC) transcription complex that transcribes small nuclear
RNAs (snRNAs) of the spliceosome has diversified in C. elegans to drive the expression of male- and female-
specific piRNAs, in addition to its canonical function in snRNA transcription. In the fly and human, the SNPC
holocomplex is composed of SNPC-1, SNPC-3, and SNPC-4 subunits, each encoded by a single gene. In
contrast, C. elegans expresses several paralogs of SNPC-1 and SNPC-3 that we propose dictate the specificity
of three distinct SNPC complexes. In particular, based on our published and preliminary data, we hypothesize
that the SNPC-1 paralogs comprise the primary specificity factors that define the unique functions of each SNPC
complex for either snRNA or sex-specific piRNA transcription. In this proposal, we will first investigate how this
specificity is achieved by identifying the cis-regulatory elements recognized by each SNPC transcription complex
(Aim 1). We will also determine the specificity domains, cofactors, and subcellular assembly of the piRNA and
snRNA SNPC complexes (Aim 2). Finally, we will characterize the biological phenotypes of the male and female
piRNA mutants and leverage these insights to predict and validate endogenous gene targets of sex-specific
piRNAs. Collectively, this research will bridge the gaps in our understanding of sexual dimorphism in piRNA
transcription and gene targeting mechanisms that ensure proper germline development and robust reproductive
capacity of animals.

 The aggregation of a-Synuclein (a-syn) into insoluble fibrils plays a key role in the pathogenesis of
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson’s disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. Despite the
documentation of a-synuclein as a component of Lewy body inclusions for over 25 years, there remains a
significant knowledge gap in the mechanisms that causally link protein aggregates to neurodegeneration. Recent
genetic studies have implicated the lysosomal degradation system into the pathogenesis of DLB and PD. Among
the strongest genetic risk factors are loss-of-function mutations lysosomal β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase)
encoded by GBA1, indicating that compromised lysosomal function may play a direct role in neurodegeneration.
During our previous funding period, we found that a-syn aggregates are initiated inside lysosomes by interacting
with glycosphingolipid substrates that accumulate upon loss of GCase. Once formed, these aggregates perturb
multiple, essential branches of the proteostasis pathway, including the folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
and post-ER trafficking at the cis-Golgi. This further augments a-syn aggregation, creating a self-propagating
pathogenic cycle. The previous funding period uncovered novel mechanisms and biological targets that enhance
the trafficking of hydrolases and lysosomal function. Here, we will build on our previous work to examine how a-
syn aggregates perturb protein folding in the ER, N-linked glycosylation in the ER, and the downstream effect
on lysosomal function. We will develop novel molecules to restore these key proteostasis pathways. Our studies
will employ a combination of patient-derived PD iPSC-neuron cultures, synucleinopathy mouse models, and
human brain. We previously found that a-syn accumulation in PD patient neurons induced ER fragmentation and
concealed the cell’s ability to recognize misfolded proteins in the ER, resulting in aggregation of immature
GCase. Since misfolded proteins in the ER are usually recognized by the unfolded protein response (UPR), in
aim 1, we will examine the link between the UPR, GCase solubility, and trafficking to the lysosome. We will
determine if triggering the UPR in PD can restore lysosomal function and reduce a-syn. In aim 2, we will test the
hypothesis that reduced glucose flux and protein N-glycosylation of GCase and other hydrolases contributes to
lysosomal depletion and dysfunction in PD. In aim 3, we will build upon our prior studies, which showed that
lysosomal function can be rescued by enhancing the SNARE protein ykt6. We will test novel small molecule
activators of the ykt6-lysosomal biogenesis pathway in vitro and in vivo. By studying basic biology mechanisms
of protein trafficking, we have a unique opportunity to link essential cellular proteostasis pathways to disease
pathogenesis. Our studies may impact the field by discovering novel pathogenic mechanisms, identifying new
biological targets, and further develop therapies to enhance lysosomal biogenesis to restore proteostasis in PD
and DLB."

Ribosome biogenesis, a complex and coordinated cellular process for making the ribosome in the nucleolus, is
essential for cell growth and proliferation. Defects in ribosome biogenesis are associated with a group of
diseases called ribosomopathies. The goal of our research program is to understand how ribosome biogenesis
is regulated during normal cell homeostasis and how it is deregulated in human diseases. Emerging evidence,
including our own work, suggests that SUMOylation plays a critical role in ribosome biogenesis. We identified
the ubiquitin-specific protease USP36 as a novel SUMO ligase that promotes the SUMOylation of snoRNP
components Nop58, Nhp2, NOP56 and DKC1, the RNA exosome component EXOSC10, and the
endonuclease Las1L, and plays a key role in multiple steps of rRNA processing. Meanwhile, deSUMOylation of
the key nucleolar proteins by SENP3 is also essential for ribosome biogenesis. Thus, the proper nucleolar
protein SUMOylation dynamics controlled by the coordinated action of USP36-mediated SUMOylation and
SENP3-mediated deSUMOylation might be essential for ribosome biogenesis. However, there are several key
gaps in understanding the SUMOylation dynamics in ribosome biogenesis, including the unclear mechanistic
insights into the role of USP36 and SENP3, the limited scope of SUMO regulation of ribosome biogenesis
identified, and the lack of dissection of the nucleolar SUMOylation dynamics. Our laboratory is well equipped in
investigating ribosome biogenesis and protein posttranslational modifications. The goals of our research
program for the next five years are to address these key gaps. We will investigate the mechanisms underlying
the roles of USP36 and SENP3 using molecular imaging, structural biology, and molecular biology approaches.
We will identify novel SUMOylation/deSUMOylation substrates of USP36 and SENP3 and dissect their roles in
specific steps of ribosome biogenesis. We will then investigate the SUMO dynamics and its role in ribosome
biogenesis and cell growth as well as the role of USP36 and SENP3 in cells in response to stress. Achieving
these goals will provide critical insights into how USP36 and SENP3 properly coordinate to regulate nucleolar
SUMOylation and ribosome biogenesis. The long-term vision of our research program is to understand how
ribosome biogenesis is deregulated in various human diseases."

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a central role in many cellular processes, including lipid metabolism.
The ER network is formed from a single membrane and yet contains functionally distinct subdomains that
allows the ER to regulate lipid metabolism and respond to stress. How this functional diversity is
mechanistically achieved is not well understood. One type of ER subdomain are regions of the ER in close
contact with other organelles, called membrane contact sites (MCSs). They play important roles in cellular
lipid homeostasis, signaling, and stress responses. Other subdomains are regions where some organelles
are formed. One is lipid droplets (LDs), which are lipid storage depots that have many roles in cell
physiology. Here, I take a multidisciplinary approach to address key gaps in our knowledge about
the formation and function of ER subdomains. Central to the projects in this proposal is the question
of how cells control the distribution of lipids within the ER and how this contributes to cellular lipid
homeostasis. There are three directions in the proposal.
 1) Direction one addresses key gaps in our understanding of how LD biogenesis occurs and goes
 awry in disease. We will leverage a novel in vitro LD biogenesis assay we have developed to
 investigate mechanism of LD formation and the roles LD biogenesis proteins. We will also
 determine how disease-causing mutations in these proteins alters their functions.
 2) Direction two addresses the mechanism and functions of a recently described new family of tube-
 like lipid transport proteins that operate MCSs.
 3) Direction three addresses a key gap in our knowledge of how the hydrophobic metabolite
 Coenzyme Q (CoQ) exits mitochondria and reaches the ER and other compartment and how export
 is regulated in response to oxidative stress. Capitalizing on a novel genetic screen we conducted,
 we will identify proteins that facilitate and regulate CoQ interorganelle transport.
Collectively, these directions will provide mechanistic insights into the formation and functions of ER
subdomains and how defects in these processes contribute to various diseases."

Efficient genome maintenance is a double-edged sword. Accurate repair of DNA lesions and damaged
replication forks promotes genome stability, which is a key to avoiding cancer, aging and neurodegenerative
diseases associated with DNA repeat expansion. The same mechanisms that maintain genome integrity in
healthy cells, allow cancer cells to acquire a more aggressive character and develop resistance to radiation and
chemotherapy. Untimely deployment and/or dysregulation of the DNA repair machines may further destabilize
the genome or may result in the accumulation of geno- and cytotoxic repair intermediates. Significant gaps
remain in our understanding of the molecular events that funnel the intermediates of otherwise accurate repair
into “rogue”, genome-destabilizing mechanisms.
This research program emphasizes the molecular and structural mechanisms by which the intermediates of DNA
metabolism bound by Replication Protein A (RPA) are channeled into DNA repair, protection of DNA replication
forks, homologous recombination, DNA damage tolerance and signaling.
Our central hypothesis is that the activities of the RAD51 recombinase, the ssDNA-binding protein RPA,
recombination mediators BRCA2 (in human) and Rad52 (in yeast), and DNA repair helicases are finely tuned by
a variety of factors, which include posttranslational modifications, interacting partner proteins, specific DNA
structures and DNA lesions. These factors affect the protein configurational dynamics and critical protein-protein
interfaces. Understanding how the protein plasticity and kinetics of assembly of the macromolecular machines
of DNA repair will show us new ways to selectively manipulate the activities of RAD51, RPA and multifunctional
DNA helicases and polymerases in DNA replication and repair.
We are leveraging and building the tools of single-molecule biochemistry, biophysics, structural and chemical
biology. Our unique perspective on the formation, activities and regulation of the nucleoprotein complexes
orchestrating genome maintenance is rooted in our ability to visualize microscopic configurational dynamics of
and sort individual human DNA repair proteins with their native posttranslational modifications, and to probe and
separate activities associated with different surface-tethered proteins and nucleoprotein complexes at the single-
molecule level. Our goal is to provide an entirely new outlook on how the cell balances the assembly and activities
of the molecular machines that can repair, but also destabilize, the genome, and to be able to alter this balance
with new chemotherapeutics targeting cancer and neurodegenerative diseases."
10841299,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Congenital heart defects are the most common and resource intensive birth defects managed in the United
States and have high morbidity and mortality. Further, significant disparities are known to exist in both
outcomes and resource requirements. Neighborhood economics, education, environment, and interpersonal
bias are thought to contribute to these inequities, yet mechanisms—and optimal targets for intervention—are
unknown. Marked heterogeneity in disease subtypes among congenital heart patients limits the power of
single-center studies and complicates conduct and interpretation of clinical research. Multicenter data are often
siloed in diagnostic or procedural registries, in in-patient databases, or are the product of individual trials and
investigations. Consequently, research conducted to improve outcomes in the CHD population is often
insufficiently powered or lacks the degree of phenotypic and socioeconomic detail necessary to allow for
clinical progress for all patients. Enhanced registry-based clinical trials that expand the “data lake” by marrying
a variety of “big data” sources—clinical registry, administrative, individual and neighborhood level social
determinants, and National Death Index (NDI) data—with prospectively collected patient-reported and clinical
outcome measures and deep genomic and proteomic phenotyping can increase effectiveness and efficiency of
clinical research. Such collaborative efforts can help us understand mechanisms underlying health inequities
such that we can develop interventions to improve care for all CHD patients. We propose bringing together
two integrated, pediatric and adult congenital heart centers in northern Manhattan with complementary, data
and clinical research expertise, to form the Pediatric Heart Network New York Consortium (PHN-NYC).
Together, these centers serve a large and diverse patient population that represents ~60% of patients
undergoing congenital heart surgery across all of New York State, is 47% low income and 36% NH-Black or
Hispanic. This consortium would leverage its interdisciplinary strengths to accomplish the following aims: 1)
Create a novel infrastructure, linking existing locally held clinical registry, administrative, social determinants of
health, and NDI data with prospectively collected genomic, proteomic, and clinical trial data to support
enhanced registry-based investigations, capable of identifying modifiable mediators of health inequities; 2)
expand engagement of families affected by congenital heart disease traditionally underrepresented in clinical
research; and 3) leverage existing NIH-funded investigator training initiatives to expand and support a next
generation of diverse congenital heart clinical researchers."

Training (UrogynCREST) program will prepare participants to recognize the critical role that data play in
delivering high quality health care. The program brings together expertise in health services and women’s
health research, biostatistics, decision science, and data science. It will target assistant professors in
urogynecology from across the country who seek successful careers in HSR and data science. The program
leverages the American Urogynecologic Society infrastructure to recruit participants with diverse racial and
socioeconomic backgrounds who have interest in a broad range of conditions resulting from PFDs. Three
cohorts will each spend 2 years in the program. The UrogynCREST program is an interactive, virtual, and
creative educational program with centralized activities organized at Duke and delivered by distance through
an on-line learning platform developed specifically for academia and designed to support teaching, research,
and collaboration. A diverse faculty has been assembled with expertise in data sciences and the advanced
methodology required to perform HSR and participants will obtain skills through a combination of didactic and
interactive coursework and training in the regulatory requirements and responsible conduct of research
necessary to work with healthcare databases. Nationally recognized HSR clinical mentors and peer mentors
will assist with identification of appropriate and existing database(s) to address the question and participants
will perform hands-on manipulation of data through extraction, cleaning, and analysis with biostatisticians.
Mentors will guide protocol development and each participant’s project will culminate in the publication of a a
peer-reviewed manuscript. In addition, analysis datasets, workflow and analysis codes, project metadata and
tools will be made publicly available using either the Duke Research Data Repository (RDR) or a designated
repository as specified in original data use agreements with the source. Yearly in-person meetings at the
annual American Urogynecologic Society meeting will encourage networking and the development of
partnerships among participants from various institutions, as well as interactions with the mentors and other
researchers in the field. This creative multidisciplinary, multi-institutional educational initiative is unprecedented
in the field of urogynecology and the program will shape future scientific leaders in urogynecology by
encouraging the development of clinician-scientists and provide the skills and resources for invigorating data
discovery and tools for investigations in HSR specifically addressing pelvic floor disorders."

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a sight-threatening neurovasculopathy and the leading cause of blindness in adults.
The number of DR patients is growing, but therapeutic approaches are limited, and many patients develop DR
despite treatment with anti-VEGF therapies. Increasing evidence suggests that Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a
prominent role in DR pathogenesis. IL-6, a pleiotropic cytokine, functions through multiple signaling modalities,
including “cis-signaling” through a membrane-bound IL-6 receptor and “trans-signaling” through a soluble IL-6
receptor. Studies suggest that the pro-inflammatory actions of IL-6 are mediated by trans-signaling, whereas
many regenerative activities of IL-6 are mediated by cis-signaling. We have observed that selective inhibition of
IL-6 trans-signaling with the drug sgp130Fc restored normal expression of VEGFA and VEGFB within the inner
nuclear layer (INL) of the retina. Müller glial cells (MGCs), a specialized glial cell type critical for retinal
homeostasis, are the major source of VEGF production in the mature retina, and, while VEGFA is implicated in
both blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown and increased oxidative stress, VEGFB is thought to be protective.
Our preliminary studies support the idea that IL-6 cis- and trans-signaling differentially modulate VEGFA and
VEGFB expression in MGCs, and that some of the effects of IL-6 on oxidative stress and endothelial (EC) barrier
function may be mediated by VEGF signaling. These observations led us to hypothesize that: (i) IL-6 cis- and
trans-signaling differentially modulate MGC-derived VEGF expression; and (ii) disruption of the “IL-6 cis-trans
balance” contributes to the retinal pathology seen in diabetic retinopathy. We will test this hypothesis with the
following Specific Aims: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that disruption of the IL-6 cis-trans balance in MGCs alters
VEGFA and VEGFB expression, leading to MGC oxidative stress and inner BRB breakdown. In this aim, we will:
(i) identify the intracellular signaling mechanisms that lead to the differential effects of IL-6 cis- and trans-signaling
in MGCs and determine how these intersect with VEGF signaling. (ii) Determine the role of VEGFA and VEGFB
in oxidative stress induced by IL-6 trans-signaling, and how IL-6 modulates the VEGF-oxidative stress positive
feedback loop in MGCs. (iii) Determine whether IL-6 cis- and trans-signaling affect the MGC-EC interactions that
maintain the inner blood-retinal barrier and if any of these effects modulated by VEGF signaling. Aim 2 will test
the hypothesis that disruption of the IL-6 cis-trans balance in diabetic mice contributes to VEGF dysregulation
and MGC dysfunction. Experiments in this Aim will answer: (i) Do IL-6 cis- and trans-signaling affect MGC-driven
VEGF signaling, oxidative damage, and breakdown of the inner blood-retinal barrier in the diabetic mouse retina?
(ii) Does treatment with sgp130Fc restore the IL-6 cis-trans balance in vivo, and does this treatment affect the
efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy to prevent structural and functional changes in the diabetic retina? Results from
these studies have the potential to provide a new therapeutic approach to mitigate the retinal neurovascular

10854510,"Project Abstract
Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), through its gentle, efficient, and fast 3D
imaging capacity, has tremendous potential in biological, biomedical, and translational
applications. However, LSFM has fragmented into a myriad of specialized instruments,
each optimized for a specific class of samples and imaging regimes. As such, the
widespread use and ultimate impact of LSFM has been curtailed by its lack of adaptability.
Here we propose a universal LSFM platform that can be adapted to a wide range of
applications, ranging from sensitive live cell imaging to imaging organs and tissues that
have been rendered transparent by different clearing techniques. Further, we will improve
the spatial and temporal resolution, as well as the volumetric coverage of LSFM. These
additional improvements will be packaged in modules, which can be integrated into our
proposed platform on demand. To demonstrate its biomedical potential, we will image
human cardiomyocytes, both live and with super-resolution microscopy, to evaluate the
performance of emerging cardiac therapies on a molecular level. In its most sensitive
configuration, our LSFM platform will be able to study spatiotemporal patterns of calcium
signaling, in health and disease, which we will analyze with statistical times series
analysis methods.
Overall, our proposal will increase the capabilities and accessibility of LSFM, and as such
will spur three-dimensional imaging in biological and biomedical research."
10845098,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT COMPONENT
(COE)
The mission of University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC) Community
Outreach and Engagement Component (COE) is to promote equitable cancer care and inform, facilitate, and
disseminate relevant research along the cancer continuum in our diverse catchment area in line with
UCCCC’s Strategic Plan, through direct engagement of its community of stakeholders and data-driven
programs. The COE team achieves this mission through activities that: (1) cultivate and maintain strong
bidirectional research partnerships between community stakeholders, and UCCCC programs and members;
(2) advocate for local and state cancer policy initiatives; and (3) engage community and academic partners
in innovative education and care delivery programs. The UCCCC catchment area encompasses five
contiguous counties: Cook County, IL (with the densely populated city of Chicago); DuPage County, IL; Will
County, IL; Lake County, IL; and Lake County, IN (in northwest Indiana). These 5 urban counties represent
77% of new patients seen at UCCCC and 73% of all accruals to treatment trials, with a population of 8 million
(48% non-Hispanic white, 23% Hispanic, 19% Black, 8% Asian). This catchment area was defined to best
support specific local geographic areas (communities, neighborhoods, and zip codes) which have high need
due to elevated cancer incidence and mortality. Specific racial and ethnic groups continue to have
disproportionate burdens of cancer incidence and mortality due to social deprivation (persistent
poverty/adverse social determinants of health), risk behaviors, environmental exposures, and known
barriers to cancer prevention, control, treatment, and survivorship. COE uses a data-driven process
engaging community and UCCCC leaders to establish priorities in cancer prevention and treatment. Our
priorities include: (1) reducing breast, colorectal, prostate, lung, and viral-mediated (cervix, oropharyngeal,
liver) cancers; (2) addressing modifiable risks (e.g., tobacco use, obesity, cancer screening, environmental
factors such as air quality and chemical exposures); and (3) addressing infrastructure needs (navigation and
enrollment in clinical trials). These areas align with the UCCCC Strategic Plan, and COE leads community
and internal UCCCC dissemination of information regarding priorities. COE partners with UCCCC basic,
clinical, translational, and population sciences researchers and with community members through formalized
programs to facilitate research that is responsive to these priority areas. Bidirectionality is a key guiding
principle for the COE team and the UCCCC Strategic Plan and is integrated when planning activities. Over
the next funding period, COE will continue to lead, evaluate, and adapt initiatives to best support community-
driven priorities through sustained bidirectional partnerships, improving infrastructure for data analysis and
visualization and continuing to nurture UCCCC members’ research that are responsive to priorities."
10845099,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT (CPDM)
The overall goal of Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) is to establish and maintain central
management and oversight functions for coordinating, facilitating, and reporting cancer clinical trials by the
University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC) in a scientifically rigorous and
regulatory-compliant manner. This goal is carried out through the Clinical Trials Support Office (CTSO) that
oversees a broad portfolio of trials including investigator-initiated clinical trials (IITs), trials through the
National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN, ETCTN) and other NCI-sponsored clinical trials, and industry-
sponsored clinical trials. The CTSO is committed to supporting high-quality clinical trials with equitable
access throughout the UCCCC catchment area. The Specific Aims of the CPDM program are to (1) Provide
centralized oversight, management, and reporting of all cancer clinical trials at the UCCCC; (2) Provide core
resources, expertise in study management, timely activation and completion of trials, and robust quality
control and quality assurance for UCCCC investigators in the conduct of investigator-initiated clinical trials
through central infrastructure within CTSO Quality Unit; (3) Hire, train, and retain a diverse, equitable, and
inclusive CTSO team with opportunities for professional growth and provide ongoing education and training
to staff and investigators to ensure safe and ethical conduct of clinical research; (4) Integrate Community
Outreach and Engagement (COE) and CTSO to improve awareness of clinical research and identify areas
of opportunity to enhance accrual of women, children, and minority cancer patients across the lifespan within
the UCCCC catchment area and beyond.
During the current project period, several strategic and operational improvements occurred. These include:
(1) reorganization and centralization of key functions under newly branded CTSO infrastructure, with an
overall 77% increase in clinical research staff from CY2017 (98 FTEs) to CY2022 (173 FTEs); (2) increased
annual operating budget of the CTSO to $5.73M (compared to $1.13M in 2018) to support new and newly
centralized units; (3) developed innovative pathway programs to attract and recruit new talent to our CTSO
with a focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion within the CTSO; (4) increase in interventional accruals during
this funding period (5,786 in previous funding period; 6,644 in current which includes 3,633 treatment
accruals); (5) growth in minority treatment accruals within our catchment area increased from 30% in CY18
to 34% in CY22; (6) growth in the number of novel IITs which increased from 4.7% to 10.8% of new trials
from 2021–2022; (7) a total of 51 new IITs (out of total of 86 actively open IITs) were open to accrual , and
45 INDs were held by UCCCC investigators, leading to a third of all accruals to IITs; (8) achieved efficient
start-up timelines for national trials (< 31 days) and decreased IIT start-up timelines by 62 days from CY21
to CY22."

The Leadership, Planning and Evaluation component of the Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) develops and
implements a vision for the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC), and
addresses Center’s overall goals, policies and operations. It serves as the framework for obtaining effective
internal and external advice, setting priorities, making decisions and defining, evaluating and executing the
Strategic Plan. Significant and substantial changes took place in Senior Leadership over the past funding period.
Kunle Odunsi, MD, PhD, a well-regarded physician/scientist with immense Cancer Center experience, was

Directors (ADs), 2 of which are new AD positions: AD for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and AD for Shared
Resources. Senior Leadership sets the goals with guidance from the Executive Committee, program leaders,
component leaders, community members, as well as internal and external advisory committees. During the
current funding period, the Senior Leadership Team led a comprehensive strategic planning and evaluation
effort. This resulted in a five-year Strategic Plan (2022-2027), that robustly aligns programmatic initiatives and
organizational priorities for the Cancer Center. A formal External Advisory Committee (EAC) meets annualy,
along with mini-EAC Retreats throughout the year addressing specific components of the CCSG, to provide
objective evaluation and advice to the Director. The external advisors are appropriately balanced for basic
laboratory, clinical, prevention, cancer control and population science and administrative expertise. UCCCC led
seminars, retreats and workshops aim to stimulate transdisciplinary research opportunities and assessment of
implementation of strategic goals. The aims of Leadership, Planning and Evaluation are: (1) To establish a
leadership structure to support the UCCCC mission; (2) To engage in planning and development of a unified
Strategic Plan and develop tactics to execute strategic decisions and oversee implementation of the Strategic
Plan; (3) To track success, implement change, and evaluate performance of the UCCCC using external and
internal advisory groups. Overall, Odunsi and the UCCCC Senior Leadership team have effectively utilized the
Cancer Center Support Grant to put in place a vigorous and robust process of vision setting, evaluation of
progress, implementation of improvements, and planning for the future."
10845102,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM (PRMS)
The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) serves as the body for scientific review and monitoring
of all cancer-related clinical trials. At the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center
(UCCCC), the PRMS consists of two Protocol Review and Monitoring Committees (PRMC), PRMC-A and
PRMC-B, which have identical responsibility and authority. The overall goal of these Committees is to ensure
that all cancer clinical trials conducted at the UCCCC are of scientific merit, as well as to monitor the progress
of these trials. PRMC is responsible for the initial protocol review, including scientific rigor (background,
statistics), and feasibility (e.g., in terms of competing studies, and populations seen at University of Chicago
Medicine). PRMC also reviews studies annually and assesses overall progress of the study in terms of
accrual, response to any stipulations placed on the protocol at the initial review, amendments, adequacy of
serious adverse event reporting as well as other items. Over the current grant period, PRMS conducted full
reviews of 1,041 new protocols; 187 received full approval, 412 received conditional approval (response
reviewed by the Chair or Co-Chair), and 66 were deferred (a new submission and a full review are required).
Of those deferred, 2 were formally disapproved upon re-review and 32 were formally withdrawn or never
submitted for re-review. Over the same period, the Committee reviewed 1,295 protocols to monitor progress
and accrual with 142 closed during the review process. Accomplishments over the current grant period
included restructuring and renaming of existing PRMS committees and membership, implementing a formal
two-stage review process for all clinical trials, redefining requirements for formal second stage review by the
PRMS committees to include only clinical trials, streamlining scientific review of protocol amendments,
enhancing and redefining the process for monitoring low accruing trials, and improving our informatics
infrastructure. The PRMS is a well-established, efficient, and effective structure for the review of UCCCC
clinical protocols. Over the next grant period, we will continue to refine processes and procedures as needed,
including decreasing activation times for new trials and improving the ability to quickly identify and update
trials that are not performing as expected. We also plan to create PRMS reviewer training materials to foster
the development of our members on the best review practices and policies."
10845103,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – SHARED RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (SRM)
The overarching scientific goal of Shared Resources Management is to enhance and accelerate UCCCC
members’ research by offering specialized expertise in cutting-edge technologies within our Shared Resources
Cores. The Shared Resources are crucial to the mission of the UCCCC and offer high-quality customized
services on state-of-the-art equipment, which aligns with the research conducted in our CCSG programs and
the pillars outlined in the UCCCC strategic plan. Shared Resource Management ensures the cores are managed
efficiently, so members have priority access to the shared resources at cost-effective and competitive rates.
There are currently 10 UCCCC cores, including Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, Cellular and Tissue-Based
Processing (cGMP), Human Immunological Monitoring Facility (HIM), Cytometry and Antibody Technology
Facility (CAT), Genomics Facility, Human Tissue Resource Center (HTRC), Integrated Microscopy (IM),
Integrated Small Animal Imaging Research Resource (iSAlRR), and Transgenic Mouse Facility (TMF). To meet
the UCCCC members’ needs and foster members’ scientific innovation and collaboration, the Shared Resources
are overseen and managed cooperatively between UCCCC and the Biological Science Division (BSD) Office of
Shared Research Facilities (OSRF). These cores are governed by the UCCCC Shared Resource Executive
Committee (SREC), which includes UCCCC and BSD leadership. SREC meets regularly to review members’
scientific needs, survey data, and metrics including budgets, usages, services, progress of developing cores,
allocations of philanthropic funds, and approval of core directors and Faculty Oversight Committee (FOC)
appointments. UCCCC members make up the majority of the membership on each of these oversight committees
to assure UCCCC needs are addressed. This cooperative management approach provides benefits to cancer
center members beyond what the Shared Resources cores provide alone, through cores such as Proteomics
and Cellular Screening Cores, which also support cancer-specific research studies. Currently, there are two
cores in development, the Organoid and Primary Cell Culture Research Core (OPCCR) and Cancer
Metabolomics, both of which were created to meet UCCCC members’ emerging research needs. In summary,
UCCCC Shared Resources have benefited greatly from CCSG support and this support has been leveraged to
provide added value to all UCCCC scientific programs. Shared Resources plays a crucial role in the research
mission and the strategic goals of the UCCCC and this continued support is critical to continuing to provide high
quality scientific services to UCCCC members at a reasonable cost and supports the discovery and development
of new Cores and services which support the UCCCC mission."

10842958,"ABSTRACT
Iron metabolism is an essential biological pathway that broadly impacts cellular processes ranging from
aerobic respiration and nucleic acid metabolism to oxygen transport and multiple biosynthetic pathways (amino
acid, nucleotide, and lipid). To maintain sufficient iron to perform these key cellular functions while avoiding the
toxicity associated with excess iron, eukaryotic cells have developed an intricate set of regulatory pathways
that coordinate iron utilization, transport, and storage and ensure that cellular iron levels are kept under tight
physiological control. My laboratory has established a multi-faceted research program that utilizes a
combination of biochemistry and proteomic mass spectrometry-based methods to explore the regulatory
mechanisms underlying iron metabolism. We are currently focused in two areas. First, we are characterizing
the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXL5 and examining the hypothesis that it functions as a key signaling hub
responsible for integrating a diverse set of iron-regulated signaling cues in order to coordinate multiple iron
homeostatic pathways. Second, we are actively developing novel proteomic mass spectrometric methods to
address key outstanding questions in iron metabolism and other biological processes. Investigation into these
areas will not only uncover novel features regulating iron metabolism but also contribute to our understanding
of how dysregulation of these pathways contributes to human disease."
10845515,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Maternal toxicant exposure and nutritional status during pregnancy contribute to the emergence of attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and serious externalizing behavioral problems. A prevailing belief is that
toxicants and fetal micronutrient deficiencies disrupt fetal brain development, with subsequent long-term
implications for offspring health and development. However, evidence that prenatal toxicant exposure and
micronutrient imbalances influence fetal neural systems in humans is lacking, as is evidence that changes in
the fetal brain precede nutrient- and toxicant-related developmental concerns of childhood. Filling these gaps
in knowledge is critical, given the high prevalence of prenatal toxicant exposure worldwide and evidence that
events during gestation influence long-range health and well-being. The central objective of this proposal is to
examine development of human neural networks in utero, and to link variation in prenatal brain development to
prenatal toxicant and nutrient levels (measured in the fetus) and to child outcomes. This will be done in a way
that is sensitive both to chemical mixture effects and to time-variant exposure across the course of gestation,
which are both likely to have specific neurodevelopmental consequences. We will pair advances in fetal
resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) MRI with innovations in tooth-biomarker assays to rigorously
investigate associations between prenatal chemical/micronutrient exposures and human fetal neural
connectome development, and will determine how exposome and connectome development in utero relate to
child neurobehavioral development. Data collection in a Detroit-based pregnancy cohort was initiated more
than 7 years ago, beginning with fetal brain RSFC MRI. Children have been followed over time, with
assessments at birth, 7 months, age 3 and age 5, and have begun to naturally shed their deciduous teeth. The
primary aims of this project are to (i) identify fetal brain connectome abnormalities associated with prenatal
toxicant exposure and micronutrient imbalance, and identify key windows of gestational vulnerability; (ii)
evaluate prenatal exposures and fetal neural connectivity as longitudinal predictors of executive function,
externalizing problems and school readiness at age 5; and (iii) isolate protective factors in the postnatal
environment that promote resilient outcomes in children with prenatal micronutrient deficiency and toxicant
exposure. We will thus be able to meaningfully evaluate whether and how prenatal nutrient availability and
toxic exposure events affect functional neurocircuitry of the developing fetal brain, and the longer-term
neurobehavioral consequences of those associations. Such work would constitute a substantial advance in our
understanding of both the longitudinal effects of micronutrient and toxicant exposures in the prenatal period
and the origins of child neurobehavioral disorders."
10846732,"Analytical Services Core: Project Summary/Abstract
The purpose of the Analytical Services Core (ASC) and two Subcores (Lipid and Oxidative Stress) is to provide
Vanderbilt Diabetes Research Center (VDRC) investigators with assays that measure plasma and tissue
hormones, cytokines, amino acids, lipids/lipoproteins, nucleotides, markers of oxidant stress, and GCMS
determination of isotopic enrichment and isotopomer distribution and mass used for metabolic flux analysis.
These services require unique instrumentation and involve rigorous standardization of procedures. It is neither
practical nor economically reasonable to establish these assays in individual laboratories. The consolidation of
services into one core laboratory provides investigators with efficient, high quality, low-cost analyses performed
by experts in the field. All services are tailored to meet the needs of the specific investigator in that the exact
protocol followed may differ depending on the analysis desired by the investigator and the sample volume to
be analyzed. Through training and education, investigators become more aware of the various services offered
and how these services might address specific areas of interest. Finally, an important function of the ASC is
method development, which not only enhances the spectrum of services offered but ultimately also increases
efficiency by providing researchers with the opportunity to expand their research programs. The core provides
space, equipment, and personnel for sample analysis. Investigators pay a fee-for-service that covers the cost
of reagents, supplies, pro-rated service contracts for equipment, and a percentage of personnel salary. The
core also serves as a valuable resource for investigators without ready access to wet-lab research space and
personnel. Core services utilize the latest instrumentation run by experienced research personnel in a
consistent, quality-controlled environment. The ASC works closely with other VDRC cores to develop standard
operating procedures to facilitate translation of this technology to VDRC investigators performing in vivo and in
vitro studies. Investigators rely on the Core and Subcore directors and their staff for advice on how to collect
and process samples collected during in vivo studies. Thus, the ASC provides essential services to VDRC
investigators that allow them to perform important and innovative diabetes research."
10828381,"Alphaviruses are vector-borne pathogens that have proven capable of causing significant outbreaks of clinical disease. Currently, there is an absolute lack of safe and approved antiviral therapies / vaccines. Thus, research which defines the molecular basis of infection is essential and critically important to not only understanding alphaviral pathogenesis, but to the development of innovative antiviral strategies. The overarching research objective of this proposal is to define the mechanism by which a novel alphavirus RNA species impacts infection and pathogenesis. The scientific premise and rationale supporting this objective are based upon a wealth of preliminary evidence which indicates that the production of noncapped genomic RNAs (ncgRNAs) is essential for alphaviral infection, as evidenced by studies involving Sindbis virus (SINV) and Ross River virus. Nonetheless, the extent to which the ncgRNAs impact viral infection is unknown and represents a critical gap in the knowledge base. Thus, we propose the following specific aims- i) To determine the mechanism with which the noncapped genomic vRNAs impact infection, and ii) To define the impact of the noncapped genomic vRNAs on viral pathogenesis. To accomplish the first aim, we will undertake an exhaustive molecular analysis of SINV infection to determine the mechanism by which the ncgRNAs effect viral infection. Specifically, we will determine whether or not ncgRNA function is linked to its translatability via a novel IRES-based approach. In addition, we will determine which viral process is negatively affected by ncgRNA reduction; and determine the molecular interactions required for ncgRNA function. The second aim uses a combinatorial approach of in vivo studies and IFN-competent tissue culture models to comprehensively define the contribution of the ncgRNAs to SINV pathogenesis. Briefly, the contribution of the ncgRNAs to the induction of a detrimental neuroinflammatory response will be evaluated in depth histologically, and at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels. Moreover, the consequences of increasing and decreasing alphaviral capping efficiency on the host innate immune response will also be defined in highly tractable tissue culture models of infection. The proposed work is highly significant in that it seeks to characterize and define the molecular importance of a novel viral RNA species. Moreover, the proposed research is conceptually and technically innovative as state-of-the-art techniques, approaches, and models of infection are used to delineate the contributions of the novel ncgRNA species to molecular infection and pathogenesis. The successful completion of this work will fundamentally expand the knowledgebase by eliminating the critical gap in understanding described above; in addition, the proposed research has a high likelihood of leading to the identification of novel antiviral strategies."
10828383,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by lung vascular endothelial (EC) barrier compromise resulting in
pulmonary edema. Gram negative (G-) bacteria are the source of bacterial toxins such as lipopolysaccharides
(LPS), which are potent triggers of ALI. Despite the use of potent antibiotics and aggressive intensive care
support, the mortality of LPS-induced ALI remains high, primarily because the complex molecular mechanisms
involved in EC barrier regulation are ill-defined. The Scientific Premise of this Project derives from our novel
preliminary data indicating that the class IIa histone deacetylase, HDAC9, is upregulated in the lungs of patients
with sepsis in concert with the inflammatory responses. Accordingly, the overexpression of HDAC9 in transgenic
mice increases basal lung vascular permeability and exacerbates vascular barrier compromise induced by LPS.
Conversely, deletion of HDAC9 gene improves lung function in LPS-induced murine ALI model. These data
suggest pro-edemagenic role of HDAC9 expression in ALI. HDAC9 is nuclear-cytoplasmic protein and its cellular
localization is regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation leads to HDAC9 nuclear export thus inhibiting its
activity in the nucleus and promoting interactions with extra-nuclear targets. We demonstrated that LPS
increases HDAC9 phosphorylation accompanied by its nuclear export in EC. In contrary, de-phosphorylation of
HDAC9 leads to nuclear import thus inhibiting its association with cytoplasmic proteins. We showed that HDAC9
interacts with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which has a barrier-protective role in EC. Further, our novel data
indicated that PP2A is activated by Gi-mediated EC barrier-protective agonists, HGF and the stable ATP analog,
ATPγS, suggesting the link between Gi-mediated signaling and PP2A in EC barrier enhancement. While the
mechanisms of Gi-mediated PP2A activation have not been described, our data suggest that they may include
the activation of GAB1/Shp2-mediated signaling. Further, both HDAC9 and PP2A interact with AJ protein
plakoglobin suggesting functional complex. However, whether the HDAC9-dependent EC barrier regulation
involved HDAC9/PP2A/plakoglobin interaction and EC barrier-protective effect of PP2A is mediated through
decreased HDAC9 phosphorylation is not yet established. Therefore, a primary goal of this Proposal will be to
define a novel role for HDAC9/PP2A crosstalk in AJ-mediated EC barrier regulation. We hypothesize that the
phosphorylation status of HDAC9 and its interaction with PP2A alter intracellular signaling to regulate the EC
barrier via effect on AJ assembly. The SAs are: 1: To evaluate the role of HDAC9 phosphorylation/nuclear export
in the LPS-induced adherens junctions-mediated endothelial barrier compromise in vitro and in vivo. 2: To
determine the importance of PP2A-mediated HDAC9 dephosphorylation/nuclear import in the assembly of AJs
and endothelial barrier strengthening in vitro and in vivo."
10828387,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 While chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-Ts) have provided impressive responses in hematologic
malignancies, children and young adults with metastatic or relapsed solid tumors have not yet benefited from
CAR-Ts and continue to suffer dismal outcomes. A major barrier to CAR-T efficacy in solid tumors is inadequate
CAR-T expansion, driven in part by CAR-T exhaustion and poor memory potential. Preclinically, CAR-T
exhaustion results from excessive CAR signaling, and can be rescued by eliminating the CD28 T cell
costimulatory domain from CAR design. Clinically, in samples from general pediatric oncology patients, poor
memory potential in T cells is associated with chemotherapy exposure. Preclinical models further suggest that
CAR-T exhaustion can be reduced by overexpressing a transcription factor, cJun, and that memory potential can
be enhanced by exposing T cells to a drug, Ibrutinib. Based on these observations, Dr. Ramakrishna will apply
novel single-cell and multi-dimensional technologies to CAR-T patient samples to assess the impact of CAR
costimulatory domain or pre-apheresis chemotherapy exposure on CAR-T exhaustion and memory potential and
ultimately on patient CAR-T fitness, defined as CAR-T molecular signature paired with functionality. To
accomplish her aims, Dr. Ramakrishna will innovatively compare CAR-T samples across three GD2 CAR-T
clinical trials. In Aim 1, with training in multi-dimensional data analysis, Dr. Ramakrishna will integrate phenotypic
(CyTOF), epigenetic (ATACseq), and transcriptomic (RNAseq) molecular signature with CAR-T functional
assessments to determine whether GD2.Ox40.CD28.z CAR-Ts (NCT02107963) confer exhaustion, thereby
affecting CAR-T fitness, as compared to GD2.41BB.z CAR-Ts (NCT04539366) in osteosarcoma patients. In Aim
2, with training on cancer immune biology, Dr. Ramakrishna will use CyTOF, ATACseq, and in vitro cytokine
production, to test the hypothesis that apheresis and CAR-T products from chemotherapy-naïve patients (diffuse
midline glioma; NCT04196413) have improved CAR-T fitness as compared to those from chemotherapy-treated
patients (osteosarcoma; NCT04539366), followed by single-cell RNAseq to track persistent CAR-T
transcriptional profiles in patients. In Aim 3, with training in immune regulation, Dr. Ramakrishna will evaluate
whether CAR-T fitness in chemotherapy-treated patient aphereses can be enhanced through modulating
molecular pathways by cJun or Ibrutinib. To build upon her substantial prior CAR-T research and clinical
experience, Dr. Ramakrishna has developed a strong training plan and mentorship team, including her primary
mentor, Dr. Crystal Mackall, a pioneer in translational immunotherapy research; co-mentor, Dr. Sean Bendall,
an innovator in multi-dimensional immune assays; advisory committee, Dr. David Miklos, Dr. Holden Maecker,
and Dr. Michelle Monje; and collaborators, Dr. Rosie Kaplan and Dr. Steven Feldman. In completing her
proposed plan with this team, Dr. Ramakrishna will be prepared to compete for R01 funding and to launch a
translational research program identifying and overcoming CAR-T limitations for pediatric solid tumors patients."
10826397,"Project Summary
Large-scale changes in brain structure occur in aging and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that demonstrate sulcal
vulnerability to age-related atrophy and AD-related amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition. Recent work has shown that the
morphology of tertiary sulci (the shallowest and latest-developing cortical indentations) is associated with
individual differences in cognitive development and symptoms of various disorders, but these sulci have not
been investigated in aging or AD. This project will investigate individual differences in gyrification in multiple
brain regions in cognitively normal older adults and adults with AD, and will combine positron emission
tomography (PET) and MRI imaging methods in investigating relationships between tertiary sulci, pathology,
and metabolism. All sulci in medial parietal cortex (MPC) and lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) will be manually
labeled on individual structural MRI scans of younger adults, cognitively normal older adults, and older adults
with AD. Morphological metrics (such as sulcal cortical thickness) will be extracted from these labels in order to
investigate their relationship to cognitive decline, AD pathology (Aβ and tau, measured with PET), and glucose
metabolism (measured with PET). Aim 1 will investigate changes in sulcal morphology in MPC and LPFC in
aging and AD. Aim 2 will identify how these changes in tertiary sulci relate to cognitive impairment and AD
pathology. Aim 3 will determine whether sulcal morphology relates to metabolism in early adulthood and
subsequent Aβ deposition in aging, as a putative explanation of how these sulci confer vulnerability to
pathology and neurodegeneration. Overall, this study will investigate whether tertiary sulci can serve as
structural markers of early degenerative and pathological changes relating to cognitive decline and AD. This
project will provide training in (1) multimodal neuroimaging acquisition and analysis techniques, (2) statistics
and data analysis methods, (3) pathophysiology of AD, (4) scientific communication, (5) teaching and
mentorship skills, and (6) career development. The UC Berkeley Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute is an ideal
environment for this research, ensuring access to cutting-edge PET and MRI neuroimaging facilities as well as
world-class neuroimaging, biostatistics, and cognitive neuroscience experts to support the project and training
goals. Ongoing collaboration with the UCSF Memory and Aging Center will provide additional training in AD
pathophysiology and research. The project’s co-sponsors are exceptionally suited to support its successful
completion: Dr. William Jagust is an expert in PET imaging and in applying multimodal neuroimaging
techniques to understand underlying mechanisms of aging and AD, and Dr. Kevin Weiner is an expert in
tertiary sulci and in linking individual differences in neuroanatomy to cognition. The proposed research and
training plans will provide the applicant with the skills and support necessary to ensure successful completion
of the project and a strong foundation to pursue a competitive post-doctoral fellowship and research career
investigating factors underlying cognitive decline in aging and dementia."
10826469,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Transposons, also known as transposable elements (TEs), are parasitic mobile DNA elements that, when re-
activated, can introduce regulatory or protein coding changes at a new site in the genome. Previous studies
showed TE activation was primarily in the germline and was thought to be overall inactive in differentiated
somatic cells and tissues. However, transposon re-activation has been observed to occur frequently in the
gastrointestinal tract, where it has been associated with diseases such as Crohn’s, colitis, and cancer. The
reasons for increased TE activity in the gastrointestinal epithelium are still poorly understood, however.
Interestingly, we have evidence of a novel interaction linking epithelial adherens junctions with transposon
regulation. The adherens junctions, comprised of E-cadherin and p120 catenin as the core adhesion complex,
act to stabilize cell-cell contacts and are frequently compromised in diseases of the colon epithelium. Preliminary
studies in the lab have uncovered an interaction of the adherens junctions with PIWIL2 (PIWI-like mediated gene
silencing 2). PIWIL2 is an endoribonuclease that is responsible for transposon silencing and germline
maintenance by interacting with piRNAs (PIWI-interacting RNAs) to target TE RNA transcripts for degradation.
We found co-localization of PIWIL2 with E-cadherin, p120 catenin, and PLEKHA7 which is an adherens junction
specific protein marker in well-differentiated colon epithelial cells and tissues. Furthermore, our data show that
disruption of the adherens junctions through depletion of E-cadherin and PLEKHA7 results in mis-localization of
PIWIL2 to the cytoplasm or nucleus. E-cadherin depletion also increases the levels of the LINE1 transposon,
which is the only autonomously active transposon in humans. Additionally, through RNA-sequencing, we have
shown a specific subset of piRNAs are depleted when PLEKHA7 is depleted. From these data, we hypothesize
that PLEKHA7 recruits PIWIL2 to the adherens junctions to suppress transposon activity in differentiated cells
to maintain the integrity of the epithelium by preventing DNA damage caused by transposons. In Aim 1 we will
examine how PLEKHA7 regulates the formation of a functional PIWIL2-piRNA complex, and use shRNA
knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9 to deplete components of the complex and examine effects on its functionality
by using retrotransposition and genomic integrity assays. The experiments proposed in Aim 2 will dissect the
mechanism of PIWIL2 recruitment specifically to the mature apical adherens junctions in well-differentiated colon
epithelial cells and examine whether disruption of this mechanism is critical in diseases such as inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn’s and colitis, as well as colon cancer using patient tissues and an organoid
system. Completion of the proposed study and training plan will further develop my technical skills, research
independence, and clinical knowledge, and will position me to become a successful independent investigator."
10826976,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality affecting over 5% of Americans. Arrhythmias
have become increasingly prevalent due to an aging population with diabetes, heart failure and hypertension,
which has led to an increasing number of invasive electrophysiology studies and catheter ablations. Our grasp
of the cardiac arrhythmia mechanism, if it is focal or reentrant, and the specific location of the arrhythmia origin
is limited by the current first-line, standard of care, noninvasive diagnostic test — the 12-lead electrocardiogram
(ECG), which is dependent on physician subjective interpretation. Furthermore, it does not present the
arrhythmia in an easily visualized, three-dimensional, anatomical manner for patients or physicians to
understand. Other noninvasive mapping techniques such as ECG imaging (ECGI) or virtual-heart technology,
requires additional preprocedural imaging such as computed tomography which exposes patient to radiation, or
magnetic resonance imaging which is costly. Over ten years, the collaborative team effort between Cardiac
Electrophysiology and Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, has developed
Electromechanical Wave Imaging (EWI), an ultrasound-based technique that takes 10-15 minute to non-
invasively image arrhythmias by visualizing the electromechanical wave corresponding to electromechanical
coupling. We have now developed a new technique, a full 3D EWI noninvasive ultrasound technique which can
construct an entire 4 chamber cardiac activation map using a single heartbeat of arrhythmia acquired in one
apical transthoracic echocardiographic image. We propose three aims which will validate non-invasive 3D EWI
to high density activation maps (HDAM) acquired during invasive electrophysiology study and demonstrate its
clinical impact to shorten procedural times and improve clinical outcomes in a randomized clinical trial. We will
demonstrate that 3D EWI is an invaluable tool for pre-ablation planning to (1) provide target localization, (2)
diagnose the mechanism of the arrhythmia, as focal or macro-reentrant arrhythmia, useful in decision-making
for systemic anticoagulation and (3) improve ablation outcomes. We will study patients with manifest pre-
excitation such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, premature atrial complexes,
premature ventricular complexes and ventricular tachycardia at two clinical sites, Columbia University (NY, NY)
and Mount Sinai Medical Center (NY, NY). This project presents a strong team with imaging expertise in
ultrasonography, clinical cardiac electrophysiology and biostatistics. Using a collaborative, multi-disciplinary and
integrated experimental approach we will clinically validate noninvasive 3D EWI with invasive 3D HDAM and
deliver a translational and transformative technique with immediate clinical impact that will enable personalized
imaging for ablation of cardiac arrhythmias."
10836229,"Autophagy represents a complex pathway of cellular homeostasis that functions in cytoprotection, but if
dysregulated can cause cell death; a complete knowledge of regulation is critical for the potential modulation
of this process for therapeutic purposes, and to increase our basic understanding of membrane dynamics and
organelle biogenesis. Autophagy occurs in all eukaryotes, and the protein components of the autophagic
machinery are conserved from yeast to mammals. The hallmark of this process is the formation of double-
membrane cytosolic vesicles, autophagosomes, that contain cytoplasmic components sequestered by the
phagophore, a unique transient compartment. After completion, the autophagosomes fuse with the
lysosome/vacuole to release the inner vesicle that is broken down, allowing access to the cargo. Autophagy
plays a role in various developmental processes and is associated with a range of pathophysiological
conditions. The long-term goals of this proposal are to understand the mechanism of action of the autophagy-
related proteins, how the process is regulated, and why specific mutations result in human disease.
 In the last 20 years, we have learned much about the molecular aspects of autophagy—43 fungal
autophagy-related (Atg) proteins have been identified, but we only have a cursory knowledge of their function.
In addition, autophagic dysfunction is associated with numerous diseases in humans, including cancer, heart
disease and neurodegeneration. Although autophagy is primarily cytoprotective, excessive autophagy is
detrimental. Thus, we need a full understanding of the regulatory network in order to apply therapeutic
interventions aimed at treating disease through autophagy modulation. In the next five years, we want to (1)
understand the structure and function of the Atg proteins; (2) define the regulatory controls that allow
autophagy induction, determine the switch between specific and non-specific types of autophagy, and
maintain autophagy at appropriate levels; and (3) decipher the relationship between mutations affecting
autophagy and diseases, with an ultimate goal of facilitating treatment. We are using yeast to investigate the
molecular mechanism of autophagy; this is the best system for a molecular genetic and biochemical analysis
of this complex process. Because of the high degree of conservation, however, the information we learn from
yeast will be applicable to more complex eukaryotes.
 The experiments described in this proposal are significant because they will elucidate important links
between upstream regulatory components and the machinery that carries out autophagy, providing the next
step in a comprehensive analysis that links the signal transduction elements to the functional apparatus,
advancing our knowledge of basic cell biology, and identifying targets for ultimate therapeutic intervention.
The proposed research is innovative, because it is providing new, and in some cases paradigm-shifting,
information about the regulatory and functional components of autophagy."
10854642,"Project Summary
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health burden. In 2021, the number of deaths from TB increased to
1.6 million, once again making it the leading cause of death from infectious disease. Current anti-tubercular
drugs are mainly effective against metabolically active and replicating bacteria. In addition to the need for new
antibiotics that are effective against both drug sensitive and drug resistant strains, there is an urgent need for
new therapeutics that can shorten therapy.
We identified several series of molecules using a target-based, high-throughput, phenotypic screen for inhibitors
of protein secretion. We evaluated these series for tractability and druglike properties and completed preliminary
structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. We identified two high priority series for hit-to-lead progression. Our
data suggest these molecules target protein synthesis and importantly, have activity against both replicating and
non-replicating bacteria.
The aim of this proposal is to develop new anti-tubercular drugs that work by targeting protein secretion and to
determine the mechanism by which these agents kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We will complete lead
generation for our priority series and generate proof of concept of in vivo efficacy in the mouse model of infection.
We will determine how inhibition of LepB-mediated secretion leads to rapid cell death in M. tuberculosis, and
why this is more pronounced under non-replicating conditions. In addition, we will determine the in vitro and in
vivo mechanisms of resistance to LepB inhibitors that will be relevant in the clinical setting.
The outcomes of this project would be (i) identification of a molecule for lead optimization; (ii) identification of the
mode of action and mechanism of kill of the series; and (iii) identification of in vitro and in vivo mechanism(s) of
resistance. Demonstration of in vivo activity and tractability of the series would lead to a full drug development
project in the future."
10861091,"Latently infected CD4+ T cells are considered to be the most important HIV reservoir preventing the
implementation of an HIV cure. However, myeloid cells have been shown to be infected by HIV/SIV and to
establish latency in animal models1-4. Therefore, elimination of the T cell reservoir alone is not likely to result in
complete virus eradication. One of our long-term goals is to aid the development of effective HIV cure
strategies by gaining a better understanding of the type and location of the cells that harbor replication
competent HIV under ART suppression. HIV-associated neurological disorders or HAND affect up to 50% of
people living with HIV (PLWH)5-7 suggesting that HIV-infected cells may persist in the brain of ART-suppressed
individuals. HIV-DNA has been readily detected in the CSF of aviremic ART-suppressed PLWH and its
presence is associated with poorer neurocognitive performance8. Analyses of brain tissue obtained
postmortem from PLWH indicate that macrophages and microglia are major targets for HIV infection in the
brain9-11 and demonstrate the presence of HIV-DNA+ cells in brain tissue from aviremic individuals10-12.
Microglia are the predominant population of myeloid cells in the brain and in contrast to macrophages, are long
lived and undergo cell division13,14. For these reasons, microglia are thought to represent a key cellular
reservoir of HIV in the brain11. While there is a significant body of knowledge about the mechanisms of HIV
latency and persistence in resting CD4+ T cells, there is significantly less known about HIV persistence in
myeloid cells and therefore, a need to establish their possible role as a source of HIV reactivation after ART
discontinuation. Specifically, in the brain the contribution of microglia is relatively unknown due in part to the
difficulties in sampling cells in this compartment in PLWH. Our hypothesis is that HIV maintains a persistent
reservoir in the brain under suppressive ART and our objective is to utilize an innovative humanized mouse
model reconstituted with human brain microglia to increase the knowledge and understanding about how
microglia contribute to HIV persistence and viral rebound by analyzing 1) HIV suppression by ART in human
microglia in the brain, 2) the viral reservoir present in infected microglia, and 3) the development of HIV latency
and rebound in human microglia in the brain after analytical therapy interruption. The new knowledge gained
from the proposed experiments will contribute to a better understanding of HIV persistence in the brain,
reactivation, and aid the development of novel HIV Cure approaches that target the CNS."
10860952,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A major gap in cancer diagnostics is that state-of-the-art imaging and other existing methods fail to reliably detect
low levels of cancer known as minimal residual disease (MRD), which remain following surgical resection of
early-stage tumors or treatment of advanced disease. Left untreated, MRD can proliferate and result in lethal
cancer recurrence. Hence, there is a critical need to sensitively detect MRD in order to optimize adjuvant
therapies or precision immunotherapy. Liquid biopsy offers the ability to noninvasively monitor MRD by detecting
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) originating from cancer cells. Nonetheless, detection of ctDNA is challenging due
to extremely low levels of ctDNA in low-burden disease. The prevailing paradigm argues for deep targeted
sequencing of informative loci. However, we have shown that this approach faces fundamental barriers to
sensitivity due to the low amount of available DNA in typical plasma samples, which imposes a physical ceiling
on depth of sequencing. To overcome this challenge, our interdisciplinary team of geneticists, computer
scientists, and oncologists developed MRDetect, an orthogonal approach for ctDNA detection based on
genome-wide mutation aggregation of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs) using
whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of plasma. MRDetect enables ultra-sensitive MRD detection down to one part
in a hundred thousand, and we have demonstrated its ability to detect MRD shortly after surgery or treatment in
colorectal cancer, melanoma and non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our objective in this project is to develop
crucial advances that will foster broad-based adoption of this technology across cancer settings. First, we
propose to incorporate advanced machine learning (ML) framework known as ‘deep learning’ (DL) into the
MRDetect platform to enable SNV identification in plasma WGS in low tumor burden settings (Aim 1). This will
yield MRDetect-DL, which we anticipate will significantly improve cancer detection at low tumor levels through
a >100-fold improvement in signal to noise enrichment compared to MRDetect. MRDetect-DL performance will
be tested in high-risk post-operative melanoma to define the need for adjuvant therapy, as well as in advanced
melanoma treated with immunotherapy for precision immunotherapy applications. Critically, MRDetect-DL will
obviate MRDetect’s need for a matched tumor sample, ensuring broad adoption across different clinical settings.
Second, we posit that in addition to SNV-based advances, MRDetect’s sensitivity can be increased by enhanced
detection of CNVs, as these are broadly observed in solid tumors. We propose to develop MRDetect-CNV, an
ML-denoising technique to ultra-sensitively detect small CNVs using plasma WGS (Aim 2). We will test
MRDetect-CNV on NSCLC plasma samples from patients undergoing neoadjuvant immunotherapy to define its
ability to predict treatment response. Impact: Pairing MRDetect-DL with MRDetect-CNV will significantly improve
low burden cancer detection in adjuvant, neoadjuvant, and systemic immunotherapy, enabling broad clinical
application in oncology."

The field of pharmacology has a direct impact on the health and care of the U.S. population. Located at The
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences (DPMS)
is well-positioned to provide superb career training in the broad field of Pharmacology. The training mission of
the Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences (PMS) Training Program is centered on providing trainees with state-
of-the-art research knowledge and professional skills focused on drug design, mechanism of action and the
process of development and translation. Our broad objective is to prepare a diverse pool of budding scientist-
scholars for a variety of pharmacology-related careers. The Program curriculum and activities are specifically
designed to provide training that covers each component of the drug discovery and development pipeline and to
nurture a positive training experience. We accomplish this objective through numerous activities designed to
develop trainee core competencies and preparation for careers in pharmacology. In addition to mentored
laboratory research, our program has four training components: 1) specialized and broad coursework in the
areas of basic and clinical pharmacology, physiology, bioorganic chemistry, drug discovery and biomedical
sciences, 2) collaborative ties to the Lieber Institute for Brain Development (LIBD), which exposes students to a
translational biotech research environment, and the Division of Clinical Pharmacology, which offers training in
the areas of clinical and translational pharmacology, 3) multi-faceted pharmacology-focused career building and
networking activities through our extensive alumni and pharmaceutical career connections and institutional
resources, and 4) multi-faceted pharmacology-related training in the responsible conduct of research and
methods to enhance reproducibility that are ongoing throughout training. With the above plan we arm our trainees
with the requisite knowledge base, technical and professional skills needed to be successful in the broad field of
pharmacology. Our success in achieving these objectives will be measured through validated assessment
instruments covering the courses, training activities, Doctorate Board Oral/Written Exams, and through external
reviews. Importantly, we strive to provide a pathway for our trainees to attain skills that allow them to achieve
work-life balance and to positively impact society in their chosen career paths. The Program intends to recruit
and retain nine new trainees each year who will be supported by this training grant for their first year of training.
In their subsequent years of mentored research, they will be supported by our well-funded and diverse training
faculty. The Program is structured to support appropriate time-to-degree for all trainees (~5 years). We provide
a unique pharmacology-focused career and professional development curriculum and environment that arms
trainees with the skills to adapt to an ever-changing biomedical research landscape and directly facilitates entry
into a broad spectrum of pharmacology-related career paths."
10860955,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause of death due to birth defects. Despite CHD
frequency, the etiology remains mostly unknown. Understanding CHD pathogenesis will help establish
prognosis, identify comorbidity risks, and develop targeted therapies. We have identified a novel CHD candidate,
SHROOM3. SHROOM3 induces actomyosin constriction and is implicated in cleft palate, neural tube and kidney
defects in humans, but is unexplored in the heart. A recent study demonstrates that SHROOM3 interacts with
Dishevelled2 (DVL2), a component of the noncanonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway,
suggesting that SHROOM3 may serve as an important link between actomyosin constriction and PCP signaling.
PCP is required for cardiac development, driving neural crest and second heart field migration to the outflow tract.
I utilized a Shroom3 gene-trap mouse (Shroom3gt/gt) to demonstrate SHROOM3-loss-of-function leads to cardiac
defects, including outflow tract defects, phenocopying PCP disruption. Additionally, through whole exome
sequencing in patients with PCP related CHD phenotypes, I identified rare and potentially damaging variants
within SHROOM3's PCP-binding domain. I hypothesize SHROOM3 is a novel component of PCP signaling and
disruption causes CHD. To test this hypothesis, Aim1a assays genetic interaction between SHROOM3 and PCP
during cardiac development, by generating compound heterozygous Shroom3gt/+;Dvl2-/+ embryos and assaying
for a cardiac defects. Aim1b assays Shroom3gt/gt embryos using western blot (WB) for phosphorylated, activated,
PCP components and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses for neural crest cell and second heart field migration
to the heart. Aim1c tests the hypothesis that SHROOM3 loss of function disrupts the PCP transcriptional profile
by assaying Shroom3gt/gt hearts using RNA-Seq analysis. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that specific SHROOM3
variants cause disrupted PCP signaling in vitro. Utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, I will generate
SHROOM3 variant induced pluripotent stem cell lines (iPSCs) and derive cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). Aim 2a
utilizes a coimmunoprecipitation WB to assay disrupted SHROOM3-DVL2 binding within the variant iPSC-CM
lines. Aim 2b assays the variant iPSC-CMs for WB and IHC evidence of PCP disruption. Aim2c assays the
variant iPSC-CMs for altered PCP transcription using RNA-seq. The research plan will demonstrate SHROOM3's
mechanism as a novel component of the PCP pathway and a novel CHD candidate gene. Indiana University's
top10 NIH funded Department of Pediatrics provides a highly supportive environment for physician-scientist
development, and my unique panel of mentors each has world-class expertise in an important aspect of the
project, including cardiovascular genetics, development, and disease modeling with mice and iPSCs. I will gain
a skillset in statistics, molecular and developmental biology, mouse and iPSC disease models, CRISPR-Cas9
gene editing and genomics analysis. The project is a move towards my goal to become a physician-scientist with
an extramurally-funded, translational research program that improves CHD diagnosis and treatment for patients."
10854735,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Comorbidities between different mood disorders, as well as those with other syndromes such as
schizophrenia, PTSD, and OCD suggest the possibility of shared underlying mechanisms that
could inform development of new treatments. However, a rate-limiting step in uncovering such
mechanisms continues to be the difficulty of studying these disorders in laboratory animals: it may
never be possible to look at the behavior of an animal and know that it is experiencing a mood
disorder.
To side-step this fundamental challenge, we take a different approach: we will establish a neural
assay of negatively biased thought. Many mood disorders are characterized by biased information
processing, including recall biases for negative past events (in major depression) and biases
towards generating negative future scenarios (in generalized anxiety disorder). Cognitive process
theories of learning, memory and decision-making indicate that such biased thought may not only
be a signature of mood disorders, but in fact causally contribute to it.
This work will develop a neural assay of negatively biased thought in mice by focusing on sharp
wave-ripples (SWRs): bursts of internally generated, synchronous neural activity in the
hippocampus that can depict past or upcoming experiences. SWRs are an attractive preclinical
target because (1) SWRs are highly conserved across mammals including rodents and humans,
making it likely that results will translate, and (2) SWR activity can be decoded to reveal their
content, such as retrieval of specific prior experiences. This implies that we can establish an
objective neural assay for negatively biased thought: given a positive and a negative experience,
are both experiences retrieved equally often, equally effective downstream, or is there a bias?
Aim 1 will optimize a behavioral task and neural assay to provide positive and negative
experiences that can be neurally distinguished, yielding for individual subjects and individual
recording sessions a SWR content bias for negative compared to positive events. Next, Aim 2 will
administer drugs known to generate affectively biased information processing in rodents in
humans (amphetamine and pramipexole) and determine their effects on SWR bias and behavior.
Finally, we will probe the mechanisms that link SWR content to motivational/affective systems at
the neural circuit level through their interaction with dopamine in Aim 3.
Taken together, the proposed work is expected to establish SWR content as a candidate
transdiagnostic process that is of broad relevance to a number of mental health disorders."

objectives is that individual health, health care, public health, and biomedical research can be
enhanced through the application of the theory and practice of biomedical informatics, data
science, and related areas to improve human health. The design of our program allows
predoctoral trainees to pursue a PhD in biomedical informatics in 4-5 years and postdoctoral
trainees to obtain further training that includes a research master’s degree if they have no prior
degree in biomedical informatics in 2-3 years. The educational program for all trainees consists
of coursework; a substantial research project culminating in dissertation for PhD students and
thesis for master’s students; and associated publications, presentations, and other academic
activities related to their research. In this funding cycle, we propose to maintain a steady state of
11 predoctoral trainees (including two HIV-focused trainees), six postdoctoral trainees, and four
short-term diversity trainees.
The OHSU Biomedical Informatics Training Program has been a leader and innovator in the
NLM T15 training grant program. In this next funding cycle, we aim to:

10854740,"Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is the most prevalent HF phenotype, currently
affecting ~3.1 million Americans 1 and disproportionately afflicting Veterans compared to non-Veterans.2
Although the VA has prioritized studies in this Veteran patient group, HFpEF remains the leading cause of
hospitalization 3 and mortality 4 within the VA Health Care System. Unfortunately, the treatment of HFpEF is
challenging, as traditional HF pharmacotherapy has failed at improving survival in this patient group, in part, due
to poor understanding of HFpEF pathophysiology.5 Clearly, this unmet need warrants new lines of research to
improve our knowledge of HFpEF and to identify alternative, therapeutic approaches to better rehabilitate this
patient group. One chief symptom of HFpEF is severe exercise intolerance, an important predictor of quality of
life, functional capacity, and mortality.6 In these patients, severe exercise intolerance is attributable to a disease-
related loss of “peripheral vascular control,” as evidenced by a marked attenuation in exercising skeletal muscle
blood flow.7 Loss of peripheral vascular control is manifested as dysfunctions of the autonomic nervous system
(ANS) and vasodilatory ability of the microvasculature, thereby restraining skeletal muscle blood flow and O2
delivery and limiting the capacity for sustained physical activity.8 Indeed, insufficient microvascular blood flow
and O2 delivery of the lower limbs have been linked to reduced functional capacity, as determined via six-minute
walk test (6MWT), thereby exacerbating physical inactivity and exercise intolerance.9 To date, the contribution
of ANS and vascular dysfunction to disease-related changes in functional capacity and exercising limb blood
flow has not been evaluated in Veterans with HFpEF, and the proposed research aims to address this significant
knowledge gap. There is some indication that aerobic exercise training may improve peripheral vascular function
in HFpEF10 , though the mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. Our group is particularly interested in the efficacy
of knee extensor (KE) training to improve functional and vascular outcomes in HFpEF, as it provides the
opportunity to study peripheral responses to exercise training with minimal cardiac involvement. Our group has
utilized this exercise model to investigate peripheral vascular control,7 although no studies to date have
capitalized on this unique exercise training modality in Veterans with HFpEF. Thus, the purpose of this CDA-2
proposal is to determine the role of ANS dysfunction (Specific Aim 1) and of vascular dysfunction (Specific
Aim 2) on exercising skeletal muscle blood flow and exercise tolerance in Veterans with HFpEF (acute phase)
and the efficacy of KE training to improve these aspects of HFpEF pathophysiology (chronic phase). These
proposed studies are highly relevant to Veteran Health, as they seek to address an unmet need within the VA
Health Care System by (a) improving our understanding of HFpEF pathophysiology and (b) determining the
efficacy of a unique exercise training modality to restore functional capacity and exercise tolerance in Veterans
with HFpEF. It is anticipated that knowledge gained will offer new insight that will ultimately advance clinical
practice in rehabilitative medicine, improving quality of care for Veterans suffering from this pervasive disease.
My long-term career goal is to become an independent VA scientist with expertise in neurovascular and exercise
physiology in Veterans with HFpEF. To meet this long-term career goal, this CDA-2 application will provide
immediate unique skills and expertise via additional mentorship and scientific/professional training (i.e.,
knowledge, technical research, and transferrable skills) in rehabilitative medicine and clinical domains in the
context of neurovascular and exercise physiology. Successful identification of peripheral vascular control
mechanisms behind exercise intolerance upon completion of this CDA-2 will provide critical information for
optimal exercise rehabilitation in Veterans with HFpEF and preliminary data for subsequent VA Merit Award and
NIH R01 applications."
10854856,"Project Summary/Abstract
High-risk polypharmacy is common among older adults in the United States and is associated with harms such
as adverse drug reactions, falls, and higher costs of care. Individuals with cognitive impairment or dementia
may be at particularly at risk for adverse outcomes from polypharmacy. To date, efforts to reduce the rate of
high-risk polypharmacy have had limited uptake due to their expense per clinician and their modest
effectiveness in helping clinicians stop potentially inappropriate medications. These prior efforts have relied on
rational clinician behavior models. However, like people in general, clinicians are susceptible to irrational
biases and cognitive shortcuts that might perpetuate inappropriate high-risk polypharmacy. Therefore,
behavioral economic nudges, which do not assume rational decision making, might be well-positioned to
reduce such high-risk polypharmacy. Moreover, such nudges can be embedded in electronic health records
(EHRs), enhancing their scalability at a low cost per clinician—as long as they are acceptable to clinicians who
worry about EHRs’ effects on their workflows.
 The overall objectives of the project are to test EHR-based behavioral economic nudges that may
reduce the prevalence and degree of high-risk polypharmacy among older adult patients and to describe their
impact on clinicians’ experiences and workflows. The specific aims are (1) to evaluate the effects of an EHR-
based commitment nudge, a justification nudge, and the combination of both nudges on a composite measure
of high-risk polypharmacy in all older adults and the subpopulation with dementia or mild cognitive impairment
via a pragmatic randomized controlled trial. This will use cluster randomization in which primary care clinics
from two large health systems are randomized to receive 0, 1, or 2 nudges using a factorial design. The
nudges will run for 18 months, followed by 12 months of observation to assess persistence of effects; and (2)
to assess qualitatively and quantitatively clinician experiences with the EHR-based nudges, including their
acceptability and effects on workflow. At the conclusion of the intervention period, semi-structured interviews
with approximately 40 clinicians will be used to describe their experiences with the nudges in detail, and a
clinician survey will be conducted to examine the relationships between clinicians’ perceptions of the nudges,
their actual use of the EHR tools, and the relationships of these factors to actual changes in high-risk
polypharmacy. The study will yield EHR-based nudges that can be implemented across the country, detailed
descriptions of how these nudges affect clinicians’ workflows (to spur dissemination), and scientific papers
documenting the nudges’ effectiveness in reducing high-risk polypharmacy among older adults."

 In recent years, large-scale sequencing revealed that the presence of clonally expanded hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cells in the bone marrow and blood of healthy individuals is a widespread phenomenon in
humans, generally referred to as clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Clonally expanded hematopoietic cells in many
instances harbor mutations associated with myeloid malignancies and, importantly, their presence is
associated with increased risk of developing myeloid malignancies (myelodysplastic syndrome, MDS and
acute myeloid leukemia, AML). Leukemic progression is invariably associated with acquisition of additional
mutations by the CH clone and further clonal expansions. CH is thus a premalignant condition that often
constitutes the initiating event of leukemogenesis and thus offers a glimpse into the early events of malignant
transformation. However, there is a relative scarcity of models to study early events of leukemogenesis, as
mice do not develop CH and most human cancer models (immortalized cell lines, patient-derived xenografts)
capture advanced cancers. My lab has pioneered the modeling of myeloid malignancies with human induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We recently developed a model of successive clonal evolution of AML.
 The overarching goal of this proposal is to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the
oncogenic effects of CH mutations. In the first Aim we will characterize cell-intrinsic (transcriptome, chromatin
accessibility, DNA methylation) and cell-extrinsic (cytokine secretion, differentiation propensity) effects of the 3
most common CH mutations – DNMT3A, TET2 and ASXL1 – using CRISPR-edited isogenic human iPSCs. In
the second Aim we will explore the role of cell competition in the clonal advantage of cells harboring CH
mutations before and after acquisition of additional mutations. In the third Aim, we will address the question of
whether fully transformed AML cells maintain or lose dependency upon the initial CH mutation using
engineered mutant alleles reversible via Cre-loxP recombination and testing the effects of correction of the CH
mutation on the initiation and maintenance of AML in vitro and in vivo in xenografts.

DNA replication restart pathways reload cellular DNA replication complexes onto
replication forks that have been prematurely terminated, forming an essential link
between DNA repair and replication. The proteins that drive these reactions, referred to
as the primosome or the Replication Restart Proteins, recognize the structures of
abandoned replication forks and reload the DNA replication machinery specifically at
these sites. The replication restart process is regulated to ensure loading fidelity and to
avoid over-replication that could arise from initiating replication at improper DNA
structures. In spite of the broad biological importance of this process, the mechanisms
underlying DNA replication restart and its regulation remain poorly understood. Our
proposal combines structural, biochemical, and genetic approaches to define the structural
and cellular mechanisms of DNA replication restart. Our overall objective is to determine
the mechanisms that govern each step of the process, from recognition of diverse

Youth current e-cigarette use rates have dramatically increased in recent years, reaching 19.8% in 2020. State
and municipal governments have passed flavor bans, e-cigarette taxes, and Tobacco 21 laws in part to
respond to these high rates of youth e-cigarette use. The long-term goal of our research agenda is to provide
information that will allow for optimal regulation of e-cigarettes by identifying intended and unintended effects of
e-cigarette policies. Specifically, the objective of our current renewal application is to use quasi-experimental
methods (e.g., difference-in-differences) to evaluate contemporary tobacco policies of flavor bans, Tobacco 21
laws, and new e-cigarette tax schema. We will use high quality, reproducible data from the Truth Longitudinal
Cohort Study, Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health, Monitoring the Future, and Youth Risk Behavior
Surveillance System to estimate: (i) the effect of flavor bans with varying levels of strength on youth e-cigarette
use, combustible tobacco product use, and substitution towards the remaining legally available flavored
tobacco products; (ii) the effect of Tobacco 21 laws on youth e-cigarette use, combustible tobacco product use
(e.g., cigarettes, cigars, hookahs), and source of e-cigarettes; and (iii) the effect of e-cigarette taxes, including
new e-cigarette tax schema of sales taxes and two-tier taxes, on youth e-cigarette use and combustible
tobacco product use. Our project is significant by carefully examining high rates of youth e-cigarette and
alternative combustible tobacco products in the United States; identifying policies to reduce tobacco-related
disease and death (the leading cause of preventable death in the United States); by contributing externally-
valid estimates of the effect of flavor bans from as many as 330 state and municipality flavor restrictions
currently on a wide variety of both flavored and unflavored tobacco product outcomes; by carefully considering
the strength of flavor bans including products covered, flavors covered, and retailer exemptions; by considering
questions on tax saliency for new types of e-cigarette taxes; and by being among the first to study the effect of
Tobacco 21 laws on youth e-cigarette use and where youth obtain e-cigarettes. Our project is innovative by
using cutting-edge quasi-experimental methods designed to mimic a randomized control trial including newer
methods designed for the presence of heterogenous treatment effects; being the first to use Truth Longitudinal
Cohort study data and Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health data for quasi-experimental research; by
providing a database of standardized e-cigarette taxes; by providing a workshop on heterogenous treatment
effect methods; and by collaborating across economics departments, a leading tobacco control non-

This application for a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award will promote Dr. Alison Huang’s mentoring and
career development in patient-oriented research on genitourinary aging in women. Dr. Huang is a general
internist and women’s health investigator dedicated to advancing scientific understanding and improving
management of the impact of aging on women’s health, especially genitourinary health. With funding from
the National Institute on Aging and other NIH institutes/centers, she leads a nationally recognized, patient-
oriented research program that emphasizes shared factors underlying aging-associated genitourinary
dysfunction and other common aging syndromes such as physical function decline, cognitive decline,
depression and anxiety, and sleep disruption. Her work to date has created new patient-reported outcome
measures used in national and international studies of genitourinary health in older women and provided
new evidence to guide diagnostic and treatment strategies for conditions such as urinary incontinence,
urogenital atrophy, nocturia, and menopausal symptoms. She has also emerged as a successful mentor of
junior clinicians who have published high-impact research, obtained federally funded research awards, and
continued to participate in patient-oriented research on older women’s health.
Currently there are no K24 awards from the National Institute on Aging that support mentorship for research
on genitourinary aging in women or on older women’s health broadly. As a result, Dr. Huang seeks support
to expand her mentoring of diverse clinical trainees interested in studying genitourinary health and function
in older women as well as the impact of aging and menopause on older women’s health. She will leverage
past and current research projects that contribute a rich repository of data on aging-related urinary and
vaginal symptoms, aging-related changes in physical and mental function, and associated quality of life in
older community-dwelling women. She will address new research questions about relationships between
changes in urinary incontinence, physical performance, psychological function, and sleep quality and
disruption in older women in response to behavioral, physical activity-based interventions, using ancillary
measures incorporated into one of her recently launched clinical trials. She will develop a new workshop
series designed to guide early stage investigators in designing and conducting pilot or feasibility trials. She
will also carry out a formal mentoring program with plans for recruitment, development, and evaluation of
additional mentees from diverse backgrounds. These plans will make full use of the outstanding research
training environment at UCSF and leverage leadership positions that Dr. Huang already holds in multiple
NIH-funded training programs to identify and support high-quality mentees with the potential to become
leaders in patient-oriented research at the intersection of aging and women’s health."

The proposed UWF U-RISE Scholars Program, modeled after the successful model Meyerhoff Scholars Program,
combines a successful model MARC Scholars Program with best practices from the UWF Chemistry Scholars
Program proven to increase persistence, graduation, and matriculation to PhD and MD-PhD degrees for
underrepresented students at the University of West Florida (UWF). The U-RISE Scholars pool of students will
include underrepresented students, specifically racial and ethnic minorities, students from low socioeconomic
backgrounds, and students with disabilities. Twelve years after establishing Chem Scholars in 2011, the ethnically
UR Chemistry graduates have increased from an average 6% during 2009-2012 to an average 30% during 2012-
2022. The percentage of ethnically UR students pursuing biomedically relevant PhD or MD-PhD
degrees has increased from 0% during 2010-2012 to an average 60% in 2012-2022. Perhaps more
impressive is the average past 5-year percentage of ethnically UR majors matriculating to PhD or MD/PhD
programs exceeds the percentage of non-UR by 14%. NIH-funded MARC Scholars expanded the model into
Biology, Mechanical Engineering and Physics in 2014. To date, 34 underrepresented MARC Scholars have been
accepted, 93% of MARC Scholars (28 of the 30 MARC Scholars) graduated with a BS degree (Biology, Chemistry,
Mechanical Engineering and/or Physics), and 80% (24 of the 30) of MARC Scholar graduates have matriculated
to PhD or MD-PhD programs, 1 MARC graduate is enrolled in a NIH-funded PREP, 1 is enrolled in a MS program,
and 2 graduates went directly into the biomedical workforce.
The proposed U-RISE Scholars Program will continue to encompass the four major components of the model
programs with several additions. U-RISE Scholars will provide the following: 1) academic and social integration
via the a 2-year research experience (on and off campus) and STEM Living Learning Community; 2) rigorous
academic preparation via professional development workshops and a seminar series tailored specifically for
STEM and biomedical topics, a STEM Writing course, an RCR and Enhancing Reproducibility course and
research experience both at UWF and R-1 institutions; 3) a support system implemented through U-RISE
Scholars, “intrusive advising,” and regulated mentoring and advising for both academic coursework, research,
and U-RISE Scholars; 4) preparation for U-RISE Scholars, matriculation to graduate school, and ultimately to a
research career through individual development plans, application materials preparation, and resume building
workshops; 5) support and training to develop Wellness and Resilience to help Scholars understand the critical
and symbiotic nature of emotional and physical health to be live a successful and fulfilled life (personally and
professionally). These resources are currently available only through NIH-funding of MARC Scholars (renamed
U-RISE Scholars with this proposal) specifically for high-achieving underrepresented junior and senior students
pursuing biomedical degrees at UWF and long-term research careers."

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent joint disease. Although aging represents one of the most important
risk factors for OA, mechanisms leading to the aging-related cartilage degeneration remain to be determined.
We reported that cellular homeostasis mechanisms such as autophagy and oxidant defenses are
compromised in aging and OA-affected cartilage. In our recent studies we investigated FoxO transcription
factors, which regulate expression of autophagy proteins and autophagy activation. FoxO3a in particular is
known as molecular gatekeeper of cellular aging. We observed a reduction in FoxO mRNA and protein
expression in aging and OA-affected cartilage in humans and mice.
These findings support the hypothesis that ‘Aging-related reduction of FoxO expression impairs protective
cellular homeostasis mechanisms, compromises chondrocyte survival and biosynthetic capacity and leads to
accelerated joint aging and initiation of OA pathogenesis’. This hypothesis will be tested in the following aims.
Aim 1: Regulation of FoxO expression and function in chondrocytes. We will examine the extracellular
regulators and mechanisms of FoxO suppression or activation and identify the responsible cis-elements in the
FoxO promoters. Using in vitro models of FoxO knock down and overexpression in normal and OA human
chondrocytes and cartilage explants from FoxO deficient mice we will examine the role of FoxO in regulating
chondrocyte functions.
Aim 2: The FoxO signaling network in cartilage. FoxO target genes are tissue and context specific. We will
establish FoxO target genes in mouse cartilage and human chondrocytes by using RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and
ChIP-seq for histone marks. Integrative analysis of these datasets will identify pathways and signaling
mechanisms that are regulated by FoxO.
Aim 3: Role of FoxO in cartilage homeostasis, aging and experimental OA. Our preliminary studies show
that conditional cartilage specific deletion of FoxO1 leads to abnormal cartilage growth postnatally and
spontaneous OA-like degradation by 6 months. We will generate postnatal triple and single knock out mice
using Acan-CreER and test them for aging related changes and severity of experimental OA.
Aim 4: Protective effects of FoxO overexpression and activation
We will generate mice that overexpress active forms of FoxO1 or FoxO3 in cartilage to balance the OA
associated suppression and determine outcomes with respect to homeostasis mechanisms and OA severity in
the aging and surgical models.
This project will establish that aging-related reduction in FoxO expression is an early and critical event in OA
pathogenesis. This will provide the foundation for therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating FoxO
expression and/or activity to prevent age-related and injury-induced onset and progression of OA.

10849962,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Macrophages capture harmful microbes by engulfing them and forming dynamic organelles called phagosomes.
Following internalization, phagosomes undergo a graded process known as phagosome maturation. This
involves the phagosome being transported by motor proteins along microtubules from the cell periphery to the
lysosomes in the perinuclear region. During transport, the nascent phagosome sequentially fuses with early and
late endosomes, leading to a gradual acidification of the phagosome lumen. Various pathogens, including
Mycobacteria, Salmonella, Candida, and others, employ strategies to subvert or adapt to the acidic phagosomal
pH, which can have serious consequences for human health. The roles of luminal pH in phagosome function
and the factors that regulate phagosomal pH are not yet fully understood. Our recent study revealed a surprising
new role for phagosomal pH in governing the transport of phagosomes and identified the sodium proton
exchanger NHE9 as a regulator of phagosomal pH. Our long-term objective is to understand how the
phagosomal environment impacts motor protein activity, to devise novel approaches for combating pathogens
evading the acidic phagosome. NHE9 hinders the directed motion of phagosomes along microtubules and
promotes early detachment from the microtubule tracks. However, the mechanism by which NHE9-mediated
changes in pH within the phagosome lumen alter phagosome transport is not yet known. This application aims
to achieve two objectives: first, to uncover the mechanism that links NHE9-mediated luminal pH regulation to
phagosome motility, and second, to characterize the effect of this regulation on the mechanics of microtubule-
associated motor transport. Dynein and kinesin motors both drive phagosome transport, but their opposing
forces create a tug-of-war. Membrane lipids could play a crucial role in regulating this process by selectively
determining which class of motors binds to phagosomes, tipping the balance in favor of one direction over the
other. Specifically, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) on early phagosomes and cholesterol on late
endosomes, are vital for motor protein recruitment and activity. Previous studies indicate luminal pH impacts
both PI3P and cholesterol levels. Our central hypothesis is that luminal pH changes mediated by NHE9 are
communicated to the motor proteins via the membrane lipids. We will test our hypothesis through the following
aims: In aim 1, we will investigate the impact of NHE9 expression on PI3P and cholesterol levels on phagosomes,
as well as the recruitment of motor proteins on these membranes. Luminal pH measurements will be conducted
in conjunction with these experiments. In aim2, we will elucidate the impact of NHE9-mediated luminal pH
changes on the mechanics of bidirectional motion. This research is significant as it will unveil the mechanism by
which luminal acidification regulates phagosome transport, a crucial process for effective pathogen elimination."

Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (U-RISE)
Abstract
The U-RISE program at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NC A&T) has,
as its overarching goal, the aim of cultivating and preparing an enthusiastic pool of undergraduate
scientists ready to pursue a Ph.D. in biomedical science. This goal was established with the
expectation that students will master the skills and acquire the confidence necessary to make
substantial contributions to the field of biomedical research. Since the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) began funding NC A&T fifteen years ago, the university has seen a remarkable growth in
the number of underrepresented (UR) undergraduate students enrolling in and completing highly
competitive Ph.D. programs in the biomedical sciences. Prior to the NIH-funded training
programs, only a very small number of undergraduates every decade enrolled in Ph.D. programs
in fields related to biomedicine. We plan to maintain this track record of success in preparing
students for Ph.D. programs in the biomedical sciences while accepting and embracing the
difficulties of increasing the efficacy of our research and academic training. Each year, we will
choose six new talented underrepresented students to participate in a challenging and intensive
scientific curriculum and provide them with high-quality, thought-provoking research projects and
activities. We will also collaborate with the University Honor’s College to provide academic and
professional skill-building events with the goal of enhancing competitiveness for the Ph.D.
Additionally, the NC A&T U-RISE program will use best practices as the foundation for various
seminars, workshops, scientific literacy and communication series, community-building,
computational skills, colloquium, and honors courses. Our comprehensive training program
consists of the following goals: Goal 1: improving and enhancing computational and quantitative
skills; Goal 2: strengthening writing and science communication skills; and Goal 3: expanding
mentoring and early career alumni networks. To achieve our overall training goals, we will pursue
the following targets: Objective 1: At least 75% of participants will enter biomedical Ph.D.
programs. Objective 2: Ensure that U-RISE trainees are progressing in the research and
academic skills training that will enhance 1) success in completing an undergraduate STEM
degree and 2) success in Ph.D. programs. Objective 3: Expand our academic and scientific skills
training to enhance competitiveness and success in biomedical Ph.D. programs. Specifically,
training in computational and quantitative skills, enhancing scientific writing and communication
skills and building a strong early career alumni network."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing cause of cancer-related death in the United States and
one of the leading causes of death in patients with cirrhosis – the end result of any chronic liver injury. HCC is
difficult to treat and outcomes have barely improved over the last 30 years, with 5-year survival under 20% and
an incidence-to-mortality ratio near 1. Innovative strategies for detection, prevention, and treatment for HCC are
desperately needed, the development of which will depend heavily on mouse models of liver cancer. The current
models are inadequate because they do not take into account the cells of origin, which will likely have a significant
impact on tumor initiation, maintenance, and therapeutic vulnerabilities. While the liver is appreciated for being
a central metabolic hub and for its astounding regenerative capacity, cellular heterogeneity in the liver is mostly
unexplored. Along the portal to central axis within the hepatic lobule, profound differences in gene expression,
metabolism, hypoxia, and ploidy are observed. Whether or not these differences reflect differences in neoplastic
potential, and whether or not they influence metabolic disease or carcinogenesis, is unclear. In recent years,
there has been intense controversy about whether or not there is a liver stem/progenitor cell. To compound these
debates, the injury assays used to drive HCC development often do not model common etiologies such as non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is emerging as the most common cause of cirrhosis in the U.S. We posit
that a critical problem for HCC modeling is a lack of understanding of how different cell types contribute to cancer
in the context of clinically relevant injuries. We believe that identifying the specific cellular subtypes that give rise
to HCC and then being able to genetically perturb these cells is critical for us to better model HCC. Unfortunately,
the field does not have mouse reagents to manipulate much of the heterogeneity in the liver. To address this,
my lab has optimized CRISPR genome-editing methods to rapidly generate lineage tracing mice. Nine new
CreER knock-in models that label different zone-specific and progenitor populations have been produced,
effectively quadrupling the number of CreER lines available to our field. We will use these tools to trace and
genetically manipulate cell types in a systematic fashion in order to identify the most important regenerative cell
populations (Aim 1) and the HCC cell(s) of origin (Aim 2) in the context of clinically-relevant chemical and
nutritional injuries. We will then ask if cell type specific gene manipulation of common HCC driver genes will help
to uncover different transformation competencies between hepatocyte subpopulations (Aim 3). Success in this
project will provide the community with a large panel of important CreER tools, allow the field to focus on
important subpopulations that are more likely to transform, and reveal pathways that control tumor development
in these cells."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in adults living with HIV (ALHIV), and
cigarette smoking is the single most important modifiable CVD risk factor in this population. Success rates for
existing smoking cessation interventions are relatively low. Poor sleep is more prevalent among smokers, more
prevalent among ALHIV, can be caused by smoking cessation attempts, predicts relapse to former smoking
patterns, and represents a parallel pathway to morbidity including increased cardiovascular disease (CVD)
among ALHIV. Thus, unhealthy sleep may make smoking cessation more difficult and increase cardiovascular
risk and other poor health conditions in ALHIV. Yet, poor sleep is amenable to nonpharmacologic interventions,
and a pilot study from our group revealed that a sleep health intervention increased smoking cessation rates
when added to routine smoking cessation treatment. The mechanisms by which improvements in sleep health
enhance tobacco cessation are unknown, but improved cognitive and affective functioning are two candidates.
To evaluate the efficacy of our sleep training approach to improve sleep health and increase smoking cessation
rates in ALHIV, the proposed study will supplement an empirically-supported smoking cessation program (6-
session, 15-week counseling program with varenicline) with a Sleep Training Approach to Reducing Smoking
(STARS) intervention developed for smokers. This intervention uniquely addresses (1) existing sleep difficulties,
if any, prior to quitting that may be associated with HIV status or nicotine use; (2) inoculation against future sleep
difficulties brought on by quitting and/or varenicline; (3) acute intervention on sleep efficiency and duration as
the participant progresses through the program; and (4) development of healthy sleep habits to carry forward
beyond the intervention. This approach is based on the gold-standard approach to treating insomnia (Cognitive
Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) but includes a number of novel elements tailored to this population. STARS
will be compared to a General Health (GH) educational control. The study will recruit N=200 ALHIV smokers
who are interested in quitting. They will be randomized to smoking cessation with either STARS (N=100) or GH
(N=100). The study will measure the efficacy of STARS versus GH to improve objectively measured healthy
sleep metrics, assess its impact on smoking cessation as well as other metrics of CVD risk, and determine
whether cognitive and affective variables mediate the association between sleep health and smoking cessation.
Results of these studies will provide practical information as well as mechanistic insight into how sleep health
can be leveraged to optimize smoking cessation treatment in ALHIV."

Protein self-assembly into structured fibrils plays both functional and dysfunctional roles in biology. We are
investigating two classes of fibril forming proteins: collagen, a fibril that forms essential interactions with
numerous proteins and extracellular matrix components for proper cellular function and α-synuclein (αS), an
intrinsically disordered protein that self-assembles into oligomers and fibrils that are associated with debilitating
synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson’s Disease. While in both cases, fibrils are often thought of as rigid,
rather inert, entities, we have recently discovered conformational dynamics that profoundly impact their atomic-
to-nano scale properties. Despite the importance of these fibrillar proteins, the molecular determinants of fibril-
protein interactions and their impact in health and disease remain unanswered. Thus, the overarching objective
of this proposal is to understand how molecular motions and surface properties modulate protein interactions
at different assembly stages (monomer, oligomer, fibril), spatial extent (atomic to nanoscale), and temporal
regime (picosecond to hours) to promote normal homeostasis or pathological disease states. The unifying
theme of this proposal is that we are developing the key techniques and protocols necessary for fibril
characterization that recognize the conformational plasticity and diverse interactions of these systems. We use
a multifaceted approach integrating solution and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, atomic
force microscopy, cryo-electron microscopy, computational methods, and link these to cellular experimentation.
We are addressing the question of how collagen fibrils recognize their binding partners (we focus in particular
on integrin, a key protein involved in platelet aggregation) despite the fact that many binding sites are hidden in
the complex collagen fibril architecture. Beyond structure/function in healthy fibrils, we will investigate the
impact of GlyX mutations in hereditary connective tissue disease such as Osteogenesis Imperfecta (brittle
bone disease) and visualize for the first time how these defects impact on fibril assembly, structure and
function. Although a very different biological system, we raise similar fibril interaction questions for αS: cell-to-
cell propagation and templated seeding of endogenous αS monomers by fibrils increases the number of fibrils
and is one of the primary factors in disease progression. This interaction mechanism is not understood and we
will investigate this by first characterizing amyloid surfaces from the atomic to the nano-scale and then
visualizing the interactions of the monomers with them. Results will shed light on the nature and specificity of
collagen and αS interactions, the biophysical and biological impact of disease-affiliated collagen mutations,
and mechanisms of pathological cell-to-cell propagation and seeding of αS aggregates. Elucidating novel
interaction mechanisms will aid in design of new therapeutic strategies to rescue compromised collagen
interactions or pathological αS aggregation in devastating neurodegenerative disease."

Combustible cigarettes (CC) use among persons with opioid use disorders (OUD), including those in OUD
methadone and buprenorphine treatment programs (OUDTP), is nearly universal (75~95%). Contributing to
premature mortality and poor quality of life, CC may also promote relapse to opioids. CC smokers in OUDTP
particularly suffer from severe intolerance to nicotine withdrawal discomfort. Even with potent, evidence-based
nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and extended care interventions, no study has found even modest rates of
sustained CC abstinence among CC smokers in OUDTP. Electronic cigarettes (EC) may be superior to traditional
NRT approaches for tobacco harm reduction either by successful switching to EC completely, or by substantially
reducing the number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD).
The goal of this R01 application is to test the effectiveness of an 8-week telehealth counseling EC harm reduction
intervention on CPD reduction among adult (≥ 21 years) CC smokers in OUDTP. We propose conducting a
randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=302) to compare telehealth counseling + nicotine EC (Intervention) vs.
telehealth counseling + combination NRT (Control) on CPD reduction. Our intervention approach is guided by the
Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model. We will recruit our sample from OUDTP in New York City using
electronic health records, in addition to participant and provider-initiated approaches. The primary outcome at
end-of-intervention (8 weeks) is the proportion of CC smokers achieving 100% CPD reduction [i.e. switching
completely to EC (Intervention Arm) or achieving CC abstinence (Control Arm)], verified by exhaled carbon
monoxide. Secondary outcomes include 100% CPD reduction at 26- and 52-weeks, percent change in CPD
relative to baseline, improvement in markers associated with health outcomes (respiratory symptoms, and
health-related quality of life), and reduction in smoking toxicant exposure as measured by NNAL (a tobacco-
specific carcinogen metabolite) in urine. The specific aims are to: 1) Compare the effect of EC versus NRT on
CPD reduction outcomes, 2) Estimate and compare the effect of EC versus NRT on health outcomes and
CC smoking exposure, 3) Evaluate moderating and mediating factors of the intervention effectiveness.
In Year 1, we will finalize the intervention protocols, surveys, hire and train staff, and create the study database
for proactive recruitment. Recruitment of participants will begin in Year 2 and will roll out over 24 months.
There is a vital need for high‐quality RCTs evaluating EC as a tobacco harm reduction strategy. If effective, EC
would provide an additional tool for tobacco harm reduction among CC smokers in OUDTP. This research has
implications for OUD treatment, as well as tobacco use treatment policy and EC regulations."

pathway). Targeting MAPK signaling using small-molecule RAF or MEK inhibitors is a validated therapeutic
strategy in cancer, but the antitumor activity of these drugs is commonly attenuated by various mechanisms of
adaptive resistance. One such common mechanism is the result of relief of negative feedback which promotes
upregulation of expression and activity of multiple Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs), which in turn activate
RAS and downstream MAPK signaling in the presence of inhibitor. Further, questions relating with how MAPK-
directed therapies can achieve a higher therapeutic index by minimally affecting normal tissue and how can
they be optimally combined with immune checkpoint therapies remain largely unresolved. SHP2 (PTPN11) is a
non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase that mediates signal transduction downstream of multiple RTKs by
associating with GRB2 and other adaptor proteins to form a complex that promotes RAS activation. SHP2 has
also been suggested to have an immunosuppressive role, but this function of SHP2 has also been relatively
understudied. The recent development of potent and selective allosteric small-molecule inhibitors targeting
SHP2 provided the opportunity to potentially overcome adaptive resistance by co-targeting both oncogenic
signaling and feedback-induced RTK-mediated RAS activation in tumors dependent on deregulated MAPK
signaling. Using one such SHP2 inhibitor, SHP099, we found that combinatorial targeting of SHP2 and MAPK
signaling prevented adaptive resistance in defined subsets of MAPK-dependent tumors. In each MAPK-driven
tumor analyzed, induction of p(Y542)SHP2, a surrogate marker of SHP2 activation, in response to MAPK
inhibition was required for combined treatment sensitivity. The strategy was broadly effective in tumor models
representing aggressive cancer types for which there are no targeted therapeutic options currently available,
including Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) models, as well as tumors with RAS mutations at G12. In
contrast, RAS(G13D)/(Q61X) mutations were associated with tumor resistance to the combination, revealing a
hitherto unappreciated complexity of mutant-RAS signaling and variability in the dependence of different RAS
mutants on upstream RTK/SHP2 signaling. Finally, using an in vitro co-culture tumor cells/T cells system we
found that SHP2 inhibition enhances T cell function. Based on these observations, we now plan to use specific
inhibitors and biochemical and cell-based methods to comprehensively study mechanisms that regulate wild-
type and mutant RAS activity downstream of RTK/SHP2 signaling. We will further investigate ex vivo and in
vivo for molecular and tumor type-specific determinants of response to combined SHP2 and MAPK inhibition,
that may be used as potential biomarkers and of the effects of these therapies on normal tissue and the
immune system. The goal is to use the mechanistic knowledge gained by these studies to develop novel
effective combinatorial pharmacologic strategies for MAPK-driven cancers."
10833121,"Core G: Genetics and High Throughput -Omics Project Summary
Aging populations worldwide, particularly in developed countries, face an increasing burden of
neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer disease (AD), Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and other
AD-related dementias (ADRDs). Genetic studies have greatly contributed to our understanding of these
complex diseases. Initial studies of a Mendelian form of AD resulted in the identification of mutations in the
genes encoding β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), Presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and Presenilin 2 (PSEN2).
Mutations in Granulin (GRN), Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau (MAPT), and C9orf72 have been identified
as causes of FTD. These diseases are characterized by protein misfolding and aggregation, and also share
some clinical and neuropathological characteristics. The promise of the twenty-first century is that we will be
able to classify these diseases by the genetic cause or genetic risk factors. Furthermore, it is clear that studies
beyond genetics, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, or epigegomics, are needed to fully understand the
biology of AD and ADRDs, with the intention of identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The goal
of the Genetics and High Throughput -Omics Core at the Knight ADRC is to obtain, bank and QC
biospecimens (DNA, RNA and plasma) from Knight ADRC participants. The Core shares these biospecimens
with qualified investigators that will generate genetic or other -omic data for these samples. The Core also
stores and harmonizes all genome-wide association study (GWAS), whole exome sequencing (WES), whole
genome sequencing (WGS), transcriptomic, and proteomic data generated for Knight ADRC participants in
order to guarantee the integrity and compatibility of the data so that these data can be shared with the scientific
community."
10833707,"ABSTRACT: Interrogating the cholinergic basis of opioid use disorder
Opioids offer unmatched clinical efficacy in the treatment of pain, and offer pronounced therapeutic potential in
the treatment of anxiety, depression, and psychosis. Nevertheless opioids come with equally harmful side effects
that can lead to opioid use disorder. Three major subtypes of opioid receptors have been identified, which are
each expressed in numerous cells. Because traditional drugs impact all cells in a given volume, it has been
difficult to map cell type-specific contributions of drug-mediated behavior. To address this gap, we developed
DART
(drugs acutely restricted by tethering), which works by genetically programming a subset of cells to capture
and concentrate a specific drug to levels ~1000 times higher than anywhere else, thus restricting drug action to
the chosen subset of cells. Here, we propose to develop, characterize, and distribute a comprehensive toolset
focused on opioid neuropharmacology. As a roadmap for the widespread adoption of these reagents, we propose
behavioral experiments motivated by a recent double-blind placebo-controlled trial in which a cholinergic drug
demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of opioid use disorder. We will test the hypothesis that μORs on
cholinergic interneurons mediate the harmful (addictive) effects of opioids, independent of helpful (analgesic)
effects. The proposed technologies will offer the unprecedented opportunity to establish causal behavioral roles
of opioid neuropharmaceuticals mediated by defined cell types. Because the technologies are rooted in
therapeutically relevant neuropharmaceuticals, clinical relevance is provided without the need to sacrifice
mechanistic rigor."

10833710,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Alcohol misuse and sexual assault are significant public health problems, especially among college
women. Heavy drinking is a primary risk factor for sexual victimization and increases risk for revictimization
and sexual dysfunction. Sex-related distress is also a common – yet rarely addressed – consequence of
sexual victimization. Women with a history of sexual victimization report drinking to cope with sex-related
distress; thereby increasing risk for revictimization. Despite strong associations between alcohol use, sexual
distress, and sexual victimization among college women, there are no interventions that concurrently target
these intersecting health outcomes. The proposed research will therefore develop an intervention that
integrates evidence-based alcohol intervention strategies, techniques to reduce sex-related distress, and
sexual assault risk reduction and resistance education with the goal of decreasing revictimization among
sexually active college women with a history of sexual victimization who report heavy drinking and sex-related
distress; a particularly high-risk group. Following a Stage 1A and 1B treatment development model, in Stage
1A information from informant interviews (N = 10) three focus groups (N = 30), stakeholder interviews (N = 6),
and a campus advisory board will guide the development of the integrated intervention. The integrated
intervention will be tested in an open trial (N = 20) in which interview and self-report methods will be utilized to
gather information regarding the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. The intervention will be
revised and then evaluated in a Stage 1B randomized pilot trial involving 90 women assigned to the proposed
intervention or an attention and dose-matched control group. Women will be followed at 2- and 6- months
post-baseline. In the Revision Phase, we will conduct exit interviews and revise the intervention to prepare for
a larger clinical trial. Results of this research are expected to inform the development of interventions that not
only target the intersection of alcohol use and sexual assault among college women, but also promote the
overall sexual health of women. This integrated approach represents a shift in how these public health
problems are typically addressed and has the potential to be widely disseminated and tailored for other
populations."
10834091,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a heterogenous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders, are an
acquired bone marrow failure syndrome. MDS is characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis resulting in
peripheral blood cytopenia and progenitor expansion. Genes encoding for RNA splicing factors (U2AF1, SF3B1,
SRSF2, and ZRSR2) are frequently mutated and occur in the founding clones of MDS, representing a unique
class of genetic vulnerability for targeted therapy. However, despite the prevalence of spliceosome mutations,
how such mutations impact different cellular mechanisms are largely unclear. Recent studies by us and others
suggest that R-loops, a group of transcription intermediates containing RNA:DNA hybrids and displaced single-
stranded DNA, are a source of genomic instability induced by different spliceosome mutants. In the preliminary
studies leading to this application, we find that PARP1 is activated by R-loops and it plays a key role in
suppressing R-loop-associated DNA damage. Furthermore, we show that MDS-associated RNA splicing factor
mutations promote R-loop accumulation and render cells sensitive to PARP inhibition. These exciting findings
lead us to hypothesize that PARP1 is a key sensor of R-loops and a critical suppressor of R-loop-associated
DNA damage. Furthermore, aberrant R-loop accumulation represents a new targetable vulnerability in MDS-
associated splicing factor mutant cells, making PARP inhibition an attractive way to target R-loop vulnerability in
MDS. Finally, since PARP inhibitors achieved limited FDA approval in different diseases, repurposing PARP
inhibitors to treat MDS patients harboring RNA splicing factor mutations may provide the fastest route to translate
our findings to the clinics. To test these hypotheses, in Aim 1, we will elucidate mechanisms by which PARP1 is
activated by R-loops. In Aim 2, we will identify global PARP1 substrates and R-loop distribution landscape in
U2AF1-mutant cells, providing a proteomic and genomic view of how PARP1 regulates R-loops. In Aim 3, we
will evaluate whether PARP inhibitor, olaparib, can selectively eliminate MDS-associated splicing mutant cells in
vitro and in vivo. Together, these studies will mechanistically explain how R-loops are sensed by PARP1 in
splicing mutant cells, reveal how PARP1 guards cells against R-loop-associated genomic instability, and address
whether R-loop-associated vulnerability in spliceosome-mutant MDS cells can be exploited by PARP inhibitors
as targeted MDS therapy. The combined expertise in R-loops, PARP1, DNA damage response and spliceosome
mutations in MDS (Nguyen laboratory), PARP regulation by proteomic approach (Leung laboratory, co-I), and
MDS GEMM mouse models of U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutations (Lee laboratory, co-I) provides us the unique
opportunity to characterize PARP1 function in cells expressing MDS-associated mutations. These studies will
not only significantly advance our understanding of R-loop biology and PARP1 signaling, but also repurpose the
use of FDA-approved PARP inhibitors in targeted therapy for MDS patients harboring RNA splicing factor
mutations by exploiting R-loop-associated vulnerability."
10839837,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal aims to improve colorectal cancer (CRC) screening uptake by developing and validating a novel
online decision aid called the Automated Colorectal Cancer Educational Support System (ACCESS). While CRC
is preventable, it still remains a major public health issue, as it is the third most prevalent and deadly malignancy
in the U.S. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that all Americans at average risk
for CRC undergo screening starting at age 50, yet one-third of Americans are unscreened. Eliciting patient
preferences by engaging in shared decision making via decision aids has been proposed as a potentially
effective strategy to improve screening rates. CRC screening is ideally suited for a shared decision making
approach, as the USPSTF endorses 7 different testing options (e.g., stool-, imaging-, and endoscopy-based
tests), each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. Of the few existing CRC screening decision tools, most
were ineffective as they were beset by imprecise assessment of patients’ preferences and ineffective integration
in clinical workflows. This proposal will address these gaps by creating an online, efficient, conjoint analysis-
based decision aid called ACCESS that generates a personalized report that rank orders the importance of each
test attribute (e.g., accuracy, invasiveness, etc.) in patients’ decision making. The report will also be shared with
their clinicians via the electronic health record so that they can efficiently recognize their patients’ priorities when
selecting a screening test. The hypothesis is that use of ACCESS, through optimizing shared decision making,
will lead to selection of a modality that accurately matches each patient’s unique values, and as a result, increase
screening uptake. To test this hypothesis, the proposal will achieve the following aims: (1) Gain insights into
patients’ knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and drivers of decision making when selecting among the different
screening options through conjoint analysis, a quantitative technique that assesses how individuals make
tradeoffs; (2) Build the ACCESS decision aid in partnership with patients, clinicians, implementation and
behavioral science experts, and computer scientists; (3) Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to determine
if ACCESS improves CRC screening uptake vs. usual care. To successfully complete the project, the PI will
receive mentorship from experienced clinicians, health services researchers, implementation and behavioral
scientists, and digital health experts. The PI will also address his knowledge gaps by taking formal coursework
in implementation and behavioral sciences, conjoint choice modeling, qualitative analysis, quality measurement
and improvement, and trial design. He will also participate in R grant writing workshops over the award period.
Obtaining these competencies combined with successful completion of the study will allow him to work towards
his goal of becoming an independent, NIH-funded digital health scientist focused on enhancing cancer
prevention and health promotion through the user-centered development and use of innovative, scalable,
evidence-based technologies that support patients and clinicians in making shared decisions."

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus; SA) is a major public health threat causing a variety of diseases from the
skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), comprising over 90% of infections, to invasive and life-threatening
infections, the major cause of SA mortality. The problem is further exacerbated by growing antibiotic resistance
and a lack of a vaccine. SA has a remarkable ability to evade and manipulate immune responses through a
range of virulence factors, including a plethora of toxins, mainly the pore-forming toxins (PFTs) and
superantigens (SAgs). Several SA surface antigen vaccines were tested in human efficacy trials and all have
failed. There is a profound knowledge gap about the nature of a protective immune response to SA infection. In
the past 10-15 years, we have learned that using staphylococcal surface antigens to enhance opsonophagocytic
clearance is not a viable strategy against SA, and response to cell-associated antigens can trigger deleterious
immune responses. Antitoxin antibodies and an effective T cell response are critical for protection against SA
infection. Neutralizing antibodies against key SA toxins, primarily PFTs, and SAgs, correlate with better clinical
outcomes. Under the prior R01 preceding this renewal application, we developed a multi-component vaccine,
IBT-V02, and demonstrated its efficacy in multiple models including primary and recurrent SSTI. IBT-V02
received further funding from CARB-X and a VC firm for advanced development and is now scheduled to enter
Phase 1 clinical trial in 2022. We intend to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine against recurrent SSTI in a follow-
on Phase 2/3 trial in patients presenting with a primary SA-SSTI. In the current renewal application, we will test
the hypothesis, in humans, that neutralizing PFTs and SAgs reduce the rate of recurrent SA-SSTI by protecting
tissues, innate immune cells, and T cells from the cytolytic and immune-modulatory effects of these toxins. In
Aim 1, we will conduct a clinical study at Olive View-UCLA emergency Department with longitudinal sampling of
patients presenting with SA-SSTI over a one-year period with monitoring for possible recurrence. This study will
provide an accurate estimate of the rate of recurrence with a tightly defined case definition and, for the first time,
provide longitudinal microbiological and immunological samples during and after a primary infection through the
time of recurrence. In Aim 2, the bacterial isolates and longitudinal immunological samples will be characterized,
and the relationship between immunological markers and probability of recurrence will be analyzed by state-of-
the-art statistical methodologies. In Aim 3, using humanized mouse models and cytokine reporter mice, we will
test the hypothesis that neutralization of PFTs and SAgs will enable the host to mount effective Th17 and γδ T
cell responses. A highly experienced team of vaccine development experts, clinicians, and immunologists with
decades of experience with SA and biostatistics experts with an extensive track record has been assembled to
address these questions. The result of this study will elevate our understanding of basic immunology of
staphylococcal infections and also inform clinical development of urgently needed vaccines for this pathogen."
10857298,"Every year, over a million children HIV-exposed but uninfected (CHEU) are born in sub-Saharan Africa and this
population will continue to increase with improving availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The long-term
effects of in utero exposure to HIV and ART on child health and well-being have not been adequately
characterized, especially in resource-limited settings. CHEU are at higher risk for infectious diseases and recent
studies suggest they may have impaired neurocognitive development compared to their children without HIV
exposure. Identifying the causes of and risk factors for neurocognitive delay is essential for the development of
effective interventions to improve the lives of CHEU children. This proposal takes advantage of the unique
opportunity to evaluate the impact of in utero HIV and ART exposure on neurocognitive development in children
by extending the cohort enrolled in an ongoing clinical study we are conducting in Malawi. We are screening
pregnant women, enrolling infants and conducting intensive analysis of neonatal adaptive immunity among
infants in three categories: (1) CHEU born to women diagnosed with HIV at the first antenatal visit, thus exposed
to uncontrolled viremia for at least half of gestation; (2) CHEU born to women initiated on ART prior to conception
with undetectable viral loads; and (3) infants born to HIV uninfected mothers. In this proposal, we will continue
enrollment into our cohort of CHEU and children without HIV exposure to reach the sample size required to
conduct a robust longitudinal analysis of neurocognitive outcomes. We will adapt standardized and locally
validated assessment tools to investigate overall neurodevelopment as well as key neurocognitive domains.
After our initial milestones are achieved, we propose to evaluate neurocognitive development at 18, 36, and 60
months of age. Our interdisciplinary study team of infectious disease specialists, developmental pediatricians,
psychologists and immunologists will lead one of the most comprehensive studies of CHEU in resource-limited
settings to simultaneously address the impact of maternal and neonatal factors on neurocognitive development
on this population. We hypothesize that in utero exposure to HIV will impair neurocognitive development in the
first five years of life and children born to HIV-infected mothers with untreated HIV infection at the start of
pregnancy will demonstrate more delay than children of mothers with undetectable HIV viral load throughout
pregnancy. We further hypothesize that immunological status at birth will contribute to impaired neurocognitive
development in HEU children and explore the possibility that basic maternal history or laboratory tests may
identify the highest risk infants. The results of this study can immediately be translated into interventions to
improve the lives of CHEU, especially in low-resource settings."

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common complications associated with diabetes. Detection of
clinical DR signs can take several years from the onset of diabetes; hence, the long preclinical phase should
provide a window to apply interventions that can slow or prevent progression to clinical endpoint (mild to
severe visual impairment). In fact, early detection and treatment of DR can prevent more than 90% of vision
loss. However, the current unmet clinical challenge is finding an appropriate tool or technology to detect
preclinical signs (biomarkers) of DR. Since the retinal vessels are early and prevalent targets of diabetic
damage, sensitive identifiers of structural and functional blood vessel changes hold great potential as
biomarkers. Recent advances in retinal imaging technology have allowed a better visualization of vessel
characteristics. Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) and OCT angiography (OCTA)
studies recently suggested that there may be a transitional vascular remodeling during the preclinical phase in
diabetic patients. Though the main benefit of these technologies is the non-invasive nature of data acquisition,
there are limitations (e.g., long scan times, limited field-of-view, motion artifacts and need for an expert
operator) that prevent these technologies to be effective preclinical detection tools to be used in a clinical
setting. Therefore, there is a great need for enhanced detection sensitivity and quantitative means to analyze
the early preclinical vasculature changes that can be readily translated into clinical practice. To address this
critical unmet clinical need, we have developed a novel dynamic tracer kinetic model to measure quantitatively
vascular permeability and blood flow changes based on fluorescein video-angiography (FVA). The approach is
immediately translatable to FVA data collected in patients as demonstrated by our preliminary data. In this
proposal, we will demonstrate that our dynamic tracer kinetic model can detect preclinical DR with a higher
sensitivity and specificity than other retinal imaging modalities such as OCTA and AOSLO. Specific Aim 1 will
optimize/validate the retinal vascular permeability and blood flow measurements against gold standard
techniques of permeability (Evans-blue) and blood flow (microspheres). Specific Aim 2 will demonstrate that
longitudinal preclinical changes in the retinal vascular permeability and blood flow detected by our model will
occur before clinical retinopathy in diabetic rodent model. Specific Aim 3 will characterize longitudinal changes
in retinal vascular permeability and blood flow in both normal subjects and diabetic patients. Specific Aim 4 will
demonstrate higher sensitivity of preclinical DR detection by the dynamic tracer kinetic model over optical
coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) in
diabetic patients without clinical retinopathy (DMnoDR)."
10857304,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Diabetes is a global epidemic that is expected to become even more severe. Although there are treatment
options, such as exogenous insulin, one of the most promising long-term treatments is transplanting donor islets
into diabetic patients. While this treatment can allow patients to maintain normal blood glucose levels for
extended periods of time, there is an extreme lack in the amount of viable donor islets for transplantation. To
combat the lack of suitable donor islets, researchers have begun to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells
(hPSCs) into β-like cells that respond to glucose by secreting insulin, with the hopes of creating a limitless supply
of transplantable pancreatic β cells. This approach has been somewhat successful; however, the current
differentiation protocols lack the ability to make pure populations of β cells and often result in immature β cells
and polyhormonal cell populations. More complete knowledge of the transcriptional networks and associated
cofactors required in the differentiation and function of pancreatic β cells is needed to supplement the current
hPSC differentiation protocols and provide the information required for better diabetes treatment options. One
such cofactor is the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4). CHD4 is the motor protein of the
nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex and, along with histone deacetylase 1 and 2 (HDAC1
and 2), CHD4 creates condensed chromatin states, thereby repressing genes. Preliminary data has shown that
CHD4 interacts with essential transcription factors in pancreatic β cells. Furthermore, my preliminary data shows
that the loss of CHD4 in the β cells of mice causes hyperglycemia along with glucose intolerance. This suggests
that CHD4 is a necessary transcriptional cofactor in the function of β cells. A better understanding of the role
CHD4 plays in the development and function of pancreatic β cells could provide additional information to facilitate
the directed differentiation of β cells from hPSCs in vitro. In this proposal, using both in vivo and in vitro
experiments, I will determine the role and mechanism of CHD4 in the development and function of
pancreatic β cells."

The most abundant internal mRNA modification is N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and growing evidence has
suggested its critical roles in cancer. However, the global patterns of m6A RNA modification and its regulators
over large patient cohorts are not available. It remains unclear how m6A RNA modification contributes to cancer
initiation/progression and how it may be used in cancer therapy. The objective is to systematically characterize
the genome-wide patterns of m6A RNA modification and its regulators using well-characterized The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) patient cohorts, elucidate their interactions with other molecular aberrations, and assess
their potential clinical utility. The working hypothesis is that the dysregulation of m6A RNA methylation plays
critical roles in cancer development and may represent potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We will
pursue three specific aims: Aim #1. Generate the genome-wide profiles of m6A RNA methylation using
TCGA sample cohorts. As part of an NCI Functional Proteomic Center, our team has unique access to these
samples. We have developed a sensitive, robust m6A-seq protocol, and will apply it to ~1,000 patient samples
from diverse cancer types, and generate high-quality, standardized m6A genome-wide profile data. Aim #2.
Generate the protein expression profiles of m6A regulators using TCGA sample cohorts. Using the MD
Anderson reverse-phase protein array platform, we will characterize the expression levels of ~30 protein markers
(including both total and phosphorylated proteins) of 15 m6A regulators (five writers, two readers, and eight
erasers) over ~8,000 samples of 31 cancer types as well as ~400 common cancer cell lines. Aim #3. Perform
the integrative analysis and modeling of m6A RNA methylation data in a rich TCGA context. Using TCGA
multi-dimensional molecular data, we will develop predictive models that quantify the effects of various factors
involved in m6A RNA modification by deep learning. We will perform analyses to define m6A-based tumor
subtypes, assess the clinical utility of m6A-related markers, and study the interactions of m6A with other molecular
aberrations in diverse tumor contexts. Finally, we will build a publicly available, user-friendly database that will
contain comprehensive information of the m6A data generated through Aim #1 and Aim #2. The expected
outcome of this project is (i) the establishment of an integrated resource of m6A-related genomic and proteomic
data based on the most widely used cancer patient cohorts, so that further investigation of such data can be
conducted by the cancer research community fluently; and (ii) assessment of the biological and clinical utility of
m6A RNA methylation for cancer therapy in a comprehensive way. This project is innovative because it will
systematically assess the clinical relevance and functions of a key class of RNA modifications that are currently
understudied in cancer research. These results will have an important positive impact because the knowledge
gained will not only greatly advance our understanding of the role of m6A RNA methylation in cancer development,
but also directly facilitate the development of a novel class of cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets."

Wilms tumor (WT) is the second most common solid pediatric cancer that usually develops in young children
before age 5. WT encompass three main cell types: epithelium, stroma, and blasterma. WT are typically
treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although the survival rate for WT
patients is generally favorable, prognosis for patients with blastema dominant histology remain poor. Patients
with blastema dominant histology are more resistance to chemotherapy and have higher rate of cancer
recurrence, therefore there is unmet clinical need to improve therapy. The major obstacle for developing
novel therapies is the lack of cell lines and animal models representing high-risk blastemal WT. Because
blastemal WT represents aberrant ESCs, we reprogrammed WiT49 WT cells of epithelial origin into induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and transplanted iPSCs into kidneys of mice. The tumors metastasized to the
liver and lung. Thus, WiT49-iPSCs represent the first blastemal WT model suitable for mechanistic studies to
understand the molecular changes distinguishing epithelial and blastemal types of WT and can be used to
screen FDA-approved drugs to find better treatments for children with aggressive WT. Because WiT49-iPSCs
acquire stem cell markers as well as metastatic traits as compared to WiT49, we hypothesize that WiT49-
iPSCs serve as a blastemal WT model suitable for mechanistic studies and drug screening to develop novel
therapies for metastatic blastemal WT. In this proposed study, we will (1) reprogram WiT49-iPSCs and
perform the teratoma assay to determine stem cell potency. (2) identify the epigenetic and chromatin
signatures distinguishing the blastemal and epithelial types of WT. (3) develop novel therapeutic strategies
for the treatment of WT. We will screen WiT49 and WiT49-iPSC cells against FDA-approved drugs and
epigenetic compounds to identify drugs effective against WiT49-iPSCs versus WiT-49 cells. Successful
completion of this project is expected to have a great impact on understanding the biology of kidney cancer
and establishing the invaluable experimental platform for the development of safer and more effective
therapies for Wilms tumors."

Pediatric traumatic injury (PTI) is a public health priority, with nearly 300,000 children incurring injuries so
severe that they require hospitalization each year. PTI is associated with annual individual and societal costs of
$87 billion and elevates risk for posttraumatic stress, depression, and other health risk consequences that
affect quality of life, physical recovery, emotional and behavioral outcomes, family roles and routines, and
academic functioning. Follow-up care for affected children and caregivers is critical to support behavioral and
emotional recovery, but few trauma centers provide these services and established, scalable models of care
are lacking. Cost-effective, sustainable interventions are needed to reduce barriers to care and reach families
that need it most. Pilot data collected by the candidate suggest that a technology-enhanced model of care is
appealing to caregivers and has high potential to address service barriers by providing real-time assistance to
help caregivers manage their own distress and their children’s behavioral and emotional recovery. The
candidate proposes to develop and systematically evaluate CAARE (Caregivers’ Aid to Accelerate Recovery
after pediatric Emergencies), an intervention informed by our ongoing clinical initiatives together with results of
qualitative semi-structured interviews with caregivers of young children after PTI. CAARE will consist of
education, self-monitoring, and coping resources. Specific aims include: 1) finalize the CAARE model and
research protocol with ~15 caregivers after PTI; 2) pilot test CAARE via an open trial (n=60); and 3) assess
CAARE implementation feasibility with families (n~20), trauma center directors (n~15), and program managers
(n~15). The research environment, facilities, and resources at MUSC are ideally suited for mentored career
development in child traumatic stress research. Dovetailing with the research aims, K23 training objectives are
to: 1) develop proficiency in clinical trial design, implementation, and evaluation; 2) enhance proficiency in the
use of iterative-design technology-based solutions; 3) develop expertise in implementation science; 4) enhance
statistical training in clinical trials, longitudinal analyses, and qualitative data analysis; and 5) expand skills in
scientific communication, including grant writing, presentations, and publications. Mentorship and consultation
from experts in pediatric trauma, health technology solutions, implementation science, and advanced statistics
will ensure training goals are met. The candidate’s long-term career goal is to establish a research portfolio
that develops, rigorously tests, and scales innovative, cost-efficient, evidence-based health technology
resources to improve access and quality of care for trauma-impacted families in real-world settings. These
research and training goals directly correspond with priorities detailed in NICHD’s Pediatric Trauma and Critical
Illness Branch, and will allow the candidate to become an internationally recognized leader in child and family
trauma prevention and treatment research. The training proposed herein is designed to develop expertise in
this area, represents a clear progression from prior training, and would not be possible without this K23."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a gradually progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in total cognitive
and functional loss. To date, disease-modifying therapeutics and secondary prevention efforts have proven
ineffective in combating this public health burden, which impacts over 5.8 million individuals, and is the 6th
leading cause of death in the United States. The proposed study addresses the critical need for minimally
invasive, cost-efficient, scalable, and accessible AD risk screening biomarkers capable of detecting AD in the
earliest pathologic stages (preclinical AD) before clinical symptoms are evident. We target biomarkers in the
human retina, a part of the central nervous system (CNS), as they can be visualized non-invasively using
standard ophthalmologic techniques and show promise for early AD risk detection and disease monitoring. The
Atlas of Retinal Imaging in Alzheimer’s Study (ARIAS) is a longitudinal, observational cohort study to identify
sensitive and specific retinal biomarkers of preclinical AD and define their context of use. The objective of the
proposed project is to leverage the existing ARIAS infrastructure, adding reference standard brain imaging
biomarkers (3T MRI, Ab PET) and novel plasma biomarkers (ptau231, ptau181) to test the central hypothesis
that retinal biomarker alterations will predict cerebral biomarker changes and mirror longitudinal cerebral
biomarker changes in preclinical AD. Four specific aims will be pursued: (1) identify retinal biomarker differences
between preclinical AD participants and cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults; (2) validate candidate retinal
biomarkers cross-sectionally against cerebral biomarkers using Ab PET as a measure of cerebral amyloidosis
and MRI as a measure of neurodegeneration; (3) determine the longitudinal relationship between retinal and
brain imaging biomarkers, and the ability of baseline retinal biomarkers to predict cognitive and/or brain imaging
biomarker changes over 3-year follow-up; and (4) (exploratory) assess the combined sensitivity and specificity
of candidate retinal biomarkers with emergent plasma biomarkers in AD risk prediction. Work will be carried out
at one existing ARIAS site and two high performing AD research sites. CU participants will complete 5 study
visits: screening, baseline, year (Y) 1, Y2, and Y3 follow-up. Brain imaging (MRI and Ab PET) and plasma
analysis will occur at baseline and Y3 follow-up. Retinal imaging and cognitive evaluation will occur at baseline
and Y1, Y2, and Y3 follow-up. Brain imaging, retinal imaging, cognitive evaluation, and plasma analysis will be
supported by four respective cores. Validating retinal biomarkers in preclinical AD is expected to shift focus in
AD retinal biomarker development towards systemic, quantitative characterization of retinal risk biomarkers
scalable for population-based AD risk screening. Combining plasma biomarkers with sensitive and specific
retinal biomarkers could transform AD risk assessment, allowing identification of AD-related changes decades
before clinical onset, which may offer the best chance of therapeutic success. Clinical applications include
population-based screening for ideal candidates for emerging secondary prevention therapeutics."

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are becoming more prevalent in the US and represent a major societal health
concern. Exposure to psychosocial stressors increases the likelihood of developing IBD in genetically
predisposed individuals, implicating a brain-gut axis in the IBD etiological framework. An emerging line of work
has established that stress-induced disruptions to the gut microbiota (i.e. dysbiosis) may be the most proximate
cause of stress-induced IBD predisposition. This includes data from our laboratory where we showed that a
mouse adaptive pathogen (C. rodentium) was more effective at colonizing and inducing colitis in mice colonized
by a microbiota from mice exposed to a chronic social defeat stressor. Moreover, our new preliminary data
provides evidence stress exacerbates chronic, immune mediated (T-cell) colitis. However, how the gut
microbiota and mucosal layer becomes dysregulated in response to stressors and why those changes
predispose worsened colitis, is not yet understood. We recently demonstrated that stress induces large shifts in
intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) activity that tightly corresponded to changes in gut microbiota function and thinning
of the mucus layer. Of those changes observed in IECs, our preliminary data indicate that the reactive-oxygen
species (ROS)-generating capacity of IECs may be the most proximate causes of stress-induced dysbiosis and
mucosal disruption. Signs of stress in IECs were absent in germ-free (GF) mice at baseline, thus implicating the
microbiota in IEC responsiveness. Nevertheless, IECs were still primed to respond differentially to an ex vivo
bacterial challenge (evidenced by an increased expression in the ROS-generating enzyme dual oxidase
(DUOX2), suggesting that host stress signaling molecules and the gut microbiota are together involved in
regulating IEC activity. Intriguingly, the upregulation in DUOX2 and ROS activity in IECs corresponded to
expansion of ROS-resistant bacteria that are capable of mucus degradation. These data led us to build a
cohesive framework underlying this proposal, whereby stress hormones ‘prime’ IECs to respond to endogenous
microbiota signaling/adhesion through heightened ROS generation. This enhanced ROS activity at the mucosal
interface creates a unique niche for mucosal associated microbes that are resistant to ROS activity and survive
by degrading mucus glycans that normally provide a barrier against both endogenous microbes and pathogens.
We hypothesize that this IEC-directed expansion of ROS-resistant, mucus-degrading endogenous microbes is
what underlies IBD susceptibility in organisms exposed to chronic, unabated stress."

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are the most common medical condition affecting pregnancy and a
leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in the Unites States. Fifty percent of women with prenatal
hypertensive disorders will continue to experience hypertension in the postpartum period. More than half of all
pregnancy-related deaths occur in the postpartum period, and over 30% of maternal deaths are complicated by
hypertensive disorders. Consequences of hypertensive disorders extend well past the perinatal period; women
with prenatal hypertensive disorders are twice as likely to develop heart disease in their lifetime, and offspring
exposed to hypertensive disorders in utero face significant lifetime cardiovascular disease risk. Therefore,
prevention of prenatal hypertensive disorders is critical to reducing risk for postpartum obstetric complications
and lifelong cardiovascular disease. Mindfulness-based interventions hold significant promise as a non-
pharmacological intervention to prevent these disorders as mindfulness-based interventions reduce blood
pressure in adults with hypertension and prehypertension, and results from our pilot RCT indicating that
prenatal mindfulness training was associated with reduced blood pressure and risk for hypertensive disorders
in at-risk women. Now, our team is conducting a 5-year RCT investigating the daily mechanisms of prenatal
mindfulness training on prenatal markers of cardiovascular risk (R01HL157288). To date, we have recruited a
racially and ethnically diverse sample of women at risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, with >90%
participant retention, and 89% of participants who completed the parent study reported interest in participating
in the proposed ancillary study. However, the most severe and fatal cardiovascular complications occur in the
postpartum period, and it is not yet known whether the cardiovascular benefits of prenatal mindfulness training
extend into the postpartum period. Thus, in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): “Heart, Lung,
Blood and Sleep Focused Ancillary Studies to Ongoing Clinical Studies,” we propose to test the long-term
effects of prenatal mindfulness training on postpartum mechanisms of risk for maternal and infant
cardiovascular disease. The proposed ancillary study will follow N=130 participants and infants that are
enrolled in the parent RCT across the first postpartum year. At 4-, 6-, and 12-months postpartum, we will
measure effects of prenatal mindfulness training on: 1) postpartum maternal cardiovascular disease
biomarkers, 2) postpartum physiological and psychological responses to ecologically valid daily experiences,
and 3) infant growth trajectories that confer risk for lifetime CVD. Results will have a significant impact on the
field by identifying modifiable mechanisms in the pre and postnatal periods to reduce rates of hypertensive
disorders and decrease lifelong burden of CVD in women and their offspring. Consistent with NHLBI’s
objectives, results from this study will help to develop and optimize novel therapeutic strategies to prevent
heart, lung, and blood diseases in women and infants."
10934576,"SUMMARY– OVERALL
The central theme of the Drexel Climate Change and Urban Health Research Center (CCUH) is the creation
and dissemination/translation of evidence that will support urban policies to address the health and equity
impacts of climate change in cities. Urban areas are key contributors to climate change and are home to large
inequities, but also present many opportunities for action. Urbanization is occurring more rapidly in lower-and
middle-income countries, and climate change is spurring migration across countries. Research on the health
impacts of climate change must span urban communities across countries, yet little work has focused on intra-
urban inequities or conducted comparative analyses of these inequities across heterogeneous cities. Based on
our established, productive collaboration across 13 institutions in the US and Latin America, we aim to build
institutional capacity at Drexel and at three partner sites included in this formative Center (University of
California Berkeley, University of São Paulo in Brazil, and INCAP in Guatemala) to support action-oriented
research on the impacts of climate change on population health and health inequities in diverse cities across
the Americas. Specifically, we will leverage existing strengths at Drexel in urban health and health equity, our
research network on urban health in Latin America (the Salud Urbana en America Latina or SALURBAL study)
and our work with US partners including US Big Cities Health Coalition. This robust, existing infrastructure will
enable us to expand our urban health and health equity work to encompass the generation of solutions-
oriented evidence on the impacts of climate change on health in cities and translate that evidence into actions
in partnership with communities and policymakers. Our aims are: (1) to create an organizational structure that
promotes collaborative and inclusive transdisciplinary and policy-relevant research on climate change and
health across cities of the Americas (Administrative Core); (2) to support capacity-strengthening for research
on climate change health impacts in urban settings through structured training activities, funding pilot grants
and research methods translation and support (Research Capacity Building Core); (2) to demonstrate the
informativeness and policy-relevance of multi-country research on climate change and health equity through a
research project on intra-urban inequities engaging researchers from the US and Latin America (Research
Project); and (4) to increase capacity for policy translation and policy impact through the engagement of policy
makers and impacted urban communities in order to inform future research questions, as well as dissemination
and translation efforts to maximize impact (Community Engagement Core.) Through these aims we will support
the creation of the infrastructure, research and engagement capacity, and partnerships needed to expand
policy relevant research on the impacts of climate change on health and health equity in urban areas. Our
ultimate goal is to become a center of excellence on climate change and urban health with a strong equity
focus, global reach and meaningful engagement of policy makers and communities to maximize policy impact."
10934577,"SUMMARY – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Administrative Core (AC) will provide oversight, coordination, and integration of all activities of the Drexel
Center on Climate Change and Urban Health (CCUH). It will support the organizational structure and
infrastructure needed to advance the central theme of the CCUH: the creation and dissemination/translation of
evidence that will support urban policies to address the health and equity impacts of climate change in cities.
The AC will leverage significant prior experience at the Drexel Urban Health Collaborative in leading and
coordinating large multinational and transdisciplinary research collaborations with a focus on urban health and
health equity in ways that are inclusive and informative for policy, practice and community action. The AC will
establish a Center Executive Committee and convene an External Advisory Board composed of external
experts and leaders who will provide input into the overall direction of the Center. The Administrative Core will
ensure that the activities of the Research Project, the Research Capacity Building Core (RCBC), and the
Community Engagement Core (CEC) are coordinated and synergistic and that our partners (University of
California Berkeley, the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, and Institute for Nutrition of Central America and
Panama (INCAP) in Guatemala) are meaningfully engaged and supported. The AC will develop and implement
a data infrastructure and management plan that facilitates collaboration and will support synthesis and
communication of key findings to stakeholders in ways that are useful for action. The AC will also monitor and
evaluate all Center activities including our plan to promote and support diversity and inclusion, and coordinate
engagement and collaborations with the Climate Change and Health Research Coordinating Center and the
broader Community of Practice. Finally, the Administrative Core will support the development of an agenda
and priorities for the future, including plans to secure additional funding and expand the research, capacity
building, and policy and community engagement work to a broader network of countries and cities across the
Americas in ways that support solutions-oriented research. The specific aims of the core are: (1) To establish
and sustain a participatory governance and administrative structure that provides programmatic and budgetary
oversight, that ensures coordination and integration of all Center activities, and that regularly monitors,
evaluates and reports on all activities; (2) To ensure that diversity and inclusion are prioritized and integrated
within all Center activities; (3) To develop and implement a data infrastructure plan that facilitates access to
and use of data on the impacts of climate change on health in urban areas for research as well as for
dissemination and engagement purposes. (4) To synthesize and communicate Center findings and lead the
development of a broader research and engagement agenda on climate change and health in urban areas that
engages multiple stakeholders at Drexel University and beyond, establishes programmatic directions and
identified new funding opportunities to ensure sustainability and expansion of Center activities into the future."
10840813,"Chronic pain affects over 100 million Americans, with an annual cost estimated at
over $500 billion. Reliance on opioid medications has led to an “opioid crisis” and
the need to identify alternative treatment for chronic pain. The proposed project
hypothesizes that chronic pain represents failure or suboptimal function of pain
modulatory capacity (PMC). The proposed project aims to test hypotheses about
resilience to clinically relevant pain challenges, and test multisystem
(psychological, behavioral, and neural) mechanisms underlying chronic pain.
Furthermore, the project aims to demonstrate the trainability of PMC in
asymptomatic controls, which has relevance for pain prevention, and in patients
with fibromyalgia (FM) who are hypothesized to have suboptimal PMC
(resilience) to pain challenges. We will test hypotheses about the trainability of
endogenous pain modulation based on similar processes seen in other
physiological systems. The research is highly innovative and challenges common
(and unsuccessful) conceptualizations of pain treatment and variability. A typical
target of pain treatment is reduction of pain variability, which we argue is
erroneous. We hypothesize that pain variability is a marker for PMC and
treatment should focus on increasing this capacity rather than eliminating it.
Demonstration of the modifiability of PMC will have direct translation to both
prevention of chronic pain and treatment of chronic pain.

10841580,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a secreted lipase and the key enzyme in clearing triglycerides from circulating lipoproteins. Because elevated plasma triglycerides are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, we seek ways to enhance LPL activity, which will lower plasma triglycerides. LPL activity is downregulated by a family of macromolecular inhibitors known as angiopoietin-like (ANGPTL) proteins. This family includes the LPL inhibitors ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4, and ANGPTL8. Loss-of-function mutations in the ANGPTLs results in increased LPL activity, and decreased serum triglycerides. Our objectives in this study are to better understand how the ANGPTLs associate with LPL, and with each other, so that we can target these interactions to prevent LPL inhibition. We will achieve these objectives in three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build on our knowledge of the mechanisms used by ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 to inhibit LPL to identify new therapeutics that specifically block the inhibitor-LPL interaction. In Aim 2, we will use cryo-electron microscopy to solve structures of LPL bound to its inhibitors. Finally, in Aim 3, we will study the function of inhibitors within cells, and their transport out of cells. Successful completion of these aims will provide molecular details describing how LPL and its inhibitors come together, as well as new ways to block these interactions. Because of LPL's key role in regulating plasma triglyceride levels, these discoveries hold promise for new ways to prevent cardiovascular disease."

Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is indispensable for structural biology studies. Arizona State University
(ASU) has a long history of leadership in the electron microscopy field. ASU has been expanding and promoting
cryo-EM research for biomedicine and fundamental biology since establishing its cryo-EM facility in 2017. ASU
has a large pool of researchers utilizing cryo-EM to study biomolecular structures and their action mechanisms
and to develop new medical applications, such as rational drug design and nanomedicine. However, the
hardware for cryo-EM imaging has dramatically advanced in recent years, and the ASU cryo-EM instrument has
been outdated, presenting challenges in imaging thick specimens for electron tomography or achieving high-
quality data of membrane or small proteins. This limits the productivity of scientific studies and prohibits the
advancement of knowledge in this field at ASU.
 To this end, ASU requests an energy filter to upgrade the cryo-EM capability, aiming to improve cryo-EM data
quality and research productivity in structural biology. An energy filter can filter the inelastically scattered
electrons and reduce the background noise, thereby boosting the data quality and improving the resolution of
the target structure. This energy filter is equipped with a new-generation direct electron detect (DED) camera,
which enhances the image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and records the data at full temporal resolution. The
proposed energy filter system is fully compatible with the current cryo-EM setup at ASU and will be operated by
the natively supported software. The new cryo-EM workflow with the proposed instrument is expected to improve
the resolutions of crystallographic reconstruction of micro-crystals and image reconstruction of single particles.
It will also allow imaging of thick samples for cell biology studies, enabling in situ structural investigation of protein
complexes.
 ASU has a complete and existing management system for multiple electron microscope instruments. The
cryo-EM instruments are managed and maintained by the ASU Eyring Materials Center (EMC), which has
extensive long-term experience and a thorough framework in managing electron microscopes and related
instruments. ASU also contains a pool of electron microscopy experts who can provide expertise and
suggestions in research and administration of these instruments. Overall, the addition of the proposed cryo-EM
upgrade will significantly benefit NIH-funded biomedical research at ASU and the broader community in the
Southwestern region."

award application by the end of the third year of the program. With heavily circumscribed clinical
responsibilities, trainees will focus on the refinement of their research projects, developing international
collaborations, and strengthening their clinical research skills."
10853596,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gammaherpesviruses (GHVs) are DNA tumor viruses that establish lifelong, chronic infections of host
lymphocytes. The expression of viral gene products that manipulate host cell physiology and thwart antiviral
immune responses places the infected host at risk for numerous cancers. For individuals with AIDS, infection by
Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. However, KSHV
does not infect mice, which complicates attempts to define mechanisms by which KSHV establishes long-term
infections and disease. To overcome this barrier, we have used a chimeric virus approach in which KSHV genes
are transferred into the closely related virus, murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), which is a natural rodent
pathogen that readily infects laboratory mice. The KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen (kLANA) is an
oncogene that modulates viral and host-cell transcription and is required for maintaining latent viral episomes as
infected cells divide. We used this MHV68-KSHV chimeric virus approach to evaluate kLANA functions during
productive viral replication, latency establishment, and maintenance. Our published work demonstrated that
kLANA was sufficient to replace MHV68 LANA (mLANA) for viral latency in mice. Remarkably, kLANA, but not
mLANA, suppressed MHV68 lytic replication by inhibiting the activity of the promoter for lytic transactivator RTA,
suggesting that KSHV-specific LANA functions are also active in the chimeric MHV68. In new preliminary data
we demonstrate that suppressed lytic replication by kLANA correlates with a drastic reduction in adaptive
immunity to chimeric virus infection, which supports the guiding hypothesis for this proposal that kLANA-
mediated inhibition of viral replication and reactivation is immune evasive. Experiments in Aim 1 will define the
scope of immune avoidance by MHV68-KSHV chimeric virus and determine the impact of reduced immunity on
outcomes of infection. We will simultaneously identify kLANA’s role as a transcription regulator in the process.
Experiments in Aim 2 will leverage reduced replication and immune evasion to define how kLANA functions
impact viral pathogenesis during immune impairment, especially when CD4 T cells are depleted as in non-drug-
controlled HIV infection. We have also developed a combinatorial MHV68-KSHV chimeric virus that encodes
multiple KSHV oncogenic latency genes for future development of chimeric virus models. Through the use of
innovative and rigorously established small-animal models of infection and disease, we will better define
mechanisms through which KSHV LANA contributes to latency and pathogenesis. This work will increase the
experimental tractability and relevance of a preclinical model and may foster the development of therapies that
target LANA and other viral proteins to treat or prevent KSHV-related cancers as a result."

10844349,"Symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (sICAS) is a common disease associated with a very high risk of stroke. Although clopidogrel + aspirin and intensive risk factor management are considered standard care for sICAS, the 1-year rate of all stroke and vascular death in subjects presenting with a symptomatic infarct and 70- 99% sICAS was 27% with this therapy in the SAMMPRIS trial. Clearly, we need better treatment. Combining ticagrelor with aspirin may be more effective than clopidogrel + aspirin for sICAS because ticagrelor provides faster, greater and more consistent platelet inhibition than clopidogrel. Additionally, ticagrelor is a direct P2Y12 receptor antagonist and may be more effective than clopidogrel in patients who carry genetic single-nucleotide loss-of-function (LOF) polymorphisms for the CYP2C19 cytochrome P450 enzyme necessary to metabolize clopidogrel to its active form. The novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) may also offer potential advantages in patients with sICAS. Atherosclerotic disease progression to an unstable state is characterized by increased platelet activation, elevated procoagulant activity and thrombin generation, which provides the mechanistic rationale for combining anticoagulation with an antiplatelet agent in patients with atherosclerosis. However, combining full dose anticoagulation with an antiplatelet agent increases the risk of major hemorrhage, including intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). This has led to interest in combining a low dose NOAC with low dose aspirin in patients with atherosclerosis. We propose a seamless Phase II/III adaptive, prospective, double-blinded, 3-arm clinical trial at 115 sites that will randomize 1683 high-risk subjects with sICAS to 1 year treatment in one of three arms: 1) ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose, then 90mg twice daily), 2) low dose rivaroxaban (2.5mg twice daily), or 3) clopidogrel (600mg loading dose, then 75 mg daily). All subjects will also receive aspirin (81mg daily) and intensive risk factor management per the SAMMPRIS protocol. The 3-arm Phase II/III adaptive design increases the efficiency with which we can evaluate two new potential therapies for sICAS, using a shared control group and a shared trial infrastructure. The Phase II Primary Aim is to identify an excess of ICH or non-ICH major hemorrhage in the rivaroxaban or ticagrelor arms that could lead to an early termination of one or both of those arms. The Phase III Primary Aim is to determine if the experimental arm(s) (rivaroxaban or ticagrelor or both) that progress from Phase II to Phase III are superior to the clopidogrel arm for lowering the 1-year rate of the primary endpoint (ischemic stroke, ICH, or vascular death) in subjects with 70-99% sICAS. The Exploratory Aim is to estimate the impact of CYP2C19 LOF carrier status on any benefit that the ticagrelor or low dose rivaroxaban arms may have in lowering the primary endpoint compared with the clopidogrel arm. This innovative trial will evaluate two new antithrombotic approaches to maximize the chance of establishing more effective therapy for sICAS, one of the most common and high-risk cerebrovascular diseases worldwide."

Large scale genetic datasets have revolutionized human genetic research. In the past decade, genome-wide
association studies have identified numerous genetic variants associated with various complex traits. These
discoveries have informed new biology and led to novel therapeutics. Yet, most studies focused on European
samples and most of the studies were conducted by pooling both sexes together. Sex-specific genetic
architecture in diverse populations remains largely elusive. As the next step, consortia efforts have begun to
aggregate datasets from diverse non-European populations. Meta-analysis is often employed in large consortium
studies There is a compelling need to develop methods that can effectively conduct trans-ancestry meta-
analysis. To this end, we will develop a series of innovative methods to improve the power for association
mapping, the precision of fine mapping and the accuracy of polygenic predictions in trans -ancestry analysis.
Resulting methods will be applied to a series of heart, lung, and blood related traits, in collaboration with a
number of consortia studies. This is a continuation of our strong track record of method development in statistical
genetics. We will implement the methods into a few widely used tools, including RVTESTS, SEQMINER, and
RAREMETAL, which will not only benefit our own study but also other researchers in the field."
10845605,"Project Summary: The primary aim of this application is to examine the effects of a clinic-integrated community
health worker (CHW) intervention on HIV outcomes among Black people with poorly managed HIV. Miami-Dade
County, Florida, is an HIV epicenter where Black adults account for 17% of the population and 64% of AIDS-
related deaths. These health disparities arise from the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH), the modifiable
circumstances in which people grow, live, work, and age. Among Black people, negative SDOH limit healthcare
access and foster racial inequities. In Miami-Dade, Black people account for ~60% of the homeless, are more
than twice as likely to live below the federal poverty level, and three times more likely to be unemployed
compared to the non-Black population. These disparities highlight the critical need for multi-level interventions
that ameliorate the impact of the SDOH on this population. Accordingly, this application aims to examine the
effects of the CHW intervention on the impact of the SDOH and system-level factors on HIV outcomes.
 For over 15 years, the University of Miami has supported research on CHW interventions to reduce HIV
disparities. Our earlier work found Black PLH randomized to receive community based CHW support for 12
months improved rates of viral suppression vs. those receiving standard HIV care. Further research found clinic
based CHW support also led to improved HIV outcomes among Black PLH. Expanding this work, this application
proposes to broaden CHW support to both community and clinical settings by integrating CHWs into HIV clinical
teams within Miami-Dade’s largest public health system. Feasibility research (1R56NR019755-01) elicited
stakeholder input on CHW clinic integration and data was used to develop a clinic-based CHW intervention that
extends care to community settings. As this work occurred during the pandemic, stakeholders were also queried
on perceptions of emerging healthcare challenges and potentially responsive CHW support strategies.
 Integrated Navigation Services for Treatment Adherence, Counseling, and Research (INSTACARE) will
embed CHWs trained in motivational interviewing into HIV clinical care teams to address SDOH, system-level
factors, and individual self-care behaviors among 300 Black PLH. Using a randomized controlled trial design,
participants will receive a 12-month CHW intervention or usual HIV care. As 1 in 3 local Black persons
emigrated from the Caribbean, CHWs will receive robust training to utilize MI strategies with Black Caribbean
subpopulations. Intervention effects on viral load, medication adherence, hospitalizations, and self-efficacy in
treatment adherence at 12 months will be determined from medical records, participant tracking data and pre
and post assessments. Subgroup analyses will compare outcomes between African American, Caribbean-
Blacks, and LGBTQ participants. Results will contribute to knowledge on the utility of clinic- and community-
based CHWs to improve HIV outcomes among Black PLH. If successful in optimizing HIV health outcomes,
this research could make a substantive contribution towards reducing other health disparities in this population."
10845607,"Project Summary/Abstract
Gains in life expectancy and population aging are driving a sharp rise in Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementias (ADRD). In this context, it is crucial to understand what factors can modify ADRD risk and cognitive
decline in older ages. Education has been identified as one potential modifier, as higher education is robustly
associated with lower ADRD risk. However, little is known about how much of this association reflects a causal
effect from education to ADRD risk and how much is driven by common third factors, such as genetics, that may
confound and moderate this relationship. In addition, the relevance of factors beyond the quantity of education
– in particular the importance of education quality as a driver of ADRD risk, as well as a moderator in the
relationship between education and ADRD – are not well understood. Filling these knowledge gaps is essential
to the design of effective policies aimed at improving cognitive health and reducing disparities in ADRD risk.
In this project, we propose to study how much of the association between education, cognition and ADRD risk
in late-life is due to a causal effect running from education quantity and quality to cognition/ADRD risk. To deal
with the fact that different people self-select into different types and quantities of schooling, we will use two
natural experiments: one school reform that affected education quantity (years of compulsory schooling) and
another that affected quality (academic curriculum). We will supplement existing datasets with the construction
of polygenic indexes (PGIs) for educational attainment (EA) and for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and by linking
participants to local historic school quality measures such as pupil/teacher ratios and teacher pay. This will allow
us to study the role of genetics and school quality in moderating the effects of both school reforms on ADRD.
We will use data from three large international aging cohorts: the UK Biobank (UK), FinnGen (Finland) and
Lifelines (the Netherlands). These cohorts allow us to study administrative-based measures of ADRD diagnosis,
ADRD risk factors and survey-based measures of cognition. Moreover, the three cohorts were genotyped,
allowing us to explore the role of genetics in driving ADRD risk as well as in moderating the relationship between
education and ADRD risk.
Establishing whether education has a causal effect on late-life cognition and ADRD risk is challenging but
essential for identifying clinical and policy interventions. Without causal evidence, policy makers do not know
whether education improves individuals' later-life cognitive health or whether the education-ADRD association
reflects differences in the characteristics of individuals who self-select into education. Moreover, it is equally
important to know what aspects of education causally affect ADRD risk. What is the relative benefit of increasing
the quantity of education versus improving its quality? Are individuals who are predicted to get more education
based on their genes protected against genetic risk of AD? The lack of such knowledge limits the design of
policies aimed at reducing disparities in ADRD risk. Our project aims to start filling these knowledge gaps."

The MapHabit System (MHS) is our neuroscience-based interactive care management platform that utilizes a
patented visual mapping system supported by smart devices to improve cognition and reinforce routine habits
in individuals living with AD/ADRD. The MHS approach relies on the discovery that certain regions of the brain
that underlie habit and procedural learning are spared during the course of AD/ADRD, and these regions can
help maintain activities of daily living (ADLs). Unmet needs addressed by the technical innovation for this
FastTrack: Caregiving is commonly acknowledged as one of the most stressful, under-recognized, under-paid,
and under-supported jobs. The new MHS+Caregiver Training Program (CTP) will offer key innovative feature
to enhance the caregivers’ own quality of life, which, in turn, will result in reduced turnover and reduced
caregiver-related cost burdens in all types of care settings, hospital systems, and for payers and providers.
This will make MHS a unique mHealth product in the AD/ADRD community and will increase its market
competitiveness, attract in-home users and be especially appealing to memory care facilities that are
concerned with achieving measurable improvements in managing caregiver burden. The CTP will feature
innovative components designed to directly support caregivers in their role, including self-paced learning
starting with understanding the caregiver’s knowledge and skill level; interactive live coaching sessions; easy
to use caregiver-centric dashboards to share information, and social networking capabilities to promote social
support and community building.
Phase I, Aim 1, will build out the CTP into the MHS platform. Phase I, Aim 2, will assess usability,
acceptability and feasibility of the CTP using iterative usability studies involving 15 caregiver/patient dyads to
determine optimal user experience, and modify the build accordingly. Phase II, Aim 1, we’ll build out enhanced
user support modules to improve the CTP experience, including visual map games to increase caregiver self-
awareness, motivation, and learning, social networks to provide social support connection to other caregivers,
and a caregiver-centric dashboard for caregivers to track their own stress and well-being, as well as key
patient performance measures. Phase II, Aim 2, will assess usability, acceptability and feasibility of the
enhanced CTP features. Phase II, Aim 3, we’ll conduct a RCT (n=50 caregiver/patient dyads) to determine if
adding the CTP to the MHS leads to enhanced caregiver and patient outcomes compared to the MHS alone.
We hypothesize that enhancing caregiver knowledge and social and emotional support will improve caregiver
quality of life, which will, in turn, improve the patient’s overall quality of care and functional status. The primary
data driven outcome will be caregiver quality of life. Patient care, determined by the MHS and standardized
cognitive assessments as well as self-reported caregiver and patient satisfaction will be assessed as well. This
integrative, easy to use caregiver-centric training program will be unique to the caregiver market."

Nearly 40% mammalian genome originates from retrotransposons. Most mammalian retrotransposons
are strictly silenced in development and physiology, yet induction of specific retrotransposons can be
observed in normal oocytes and preimplantation embryos. Interestingly, a subset of retrotransposons
confer a gene regulatory role, at least in part, by acting as alternative promoters, exons and
polyadenylation signals to regulate proximal protein-coding genes. Such retrotransposon-dependent
gene regulation frequently alter gene structure and/or gene expression, and have been shown in our
preliminary studies to play important developmental functions in oocyte biology and preimplantation
development.
Female reproductive aging presents an excellent experimental system to probe the functional importance
of retrotransposons in aging. Unlike somatic tissues which strongly repress retrotransposon expression,
oocytes and preimplantation embryos exhibit a strong induction of specific retrotransposons, possibly
due to extensive epigenetic reprogramming during these unique developmental stages. Our preliminary
studies show that aged oocytes exhibit expression alteration of specific retrotransposons, as well as
RT:gene isoforms. Interestingly, the IAPEy4 family, which is retrotransposition-competent, is strongly
induced in aged oocytes. IAPEy4 induction could lead to DNA damage and innate immune response in
aged oocytes, as a result of its retrotransposition. In addition, the MII oocyte specific MTC-Dicer1 isoform
is strongly repressed in aged oocytes. The MTC-Dicer1 encodes an N-terminally truncated Dicer isoform
that governs the transposon surveillance through post-transcriptional silencing by RNAi. These findings
suggest that altered retrotransposon expression and retrotransposon mediated gene regulation in aged
oocytes could functionally promote reproductive aging. Using genomics, mouse genetics, cell and
molecular biology, we proposed to investigate the importance of retrotransposons in female reproductive
aging. We will 1) profile retrotransposons and retrotransposon-dependent gene regulation in young and
old oocytes and somatic granulosa cells; 2) Investigate the importance of aberrant retrotransposon
induction and retrotransposition during reproductive aging; 3) investigate the importance of
retrotransposon mediated gene regulation in reproductive aging. Taken together, the proposed studies
will provide new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern female reproductive
aging, and will add a new dimension to our understanding of retrotransposon functions in development
and disease."

The Administrative and Enrichment Core oversees the Vanderbilt Diabetes Research Center's (VDRC)
interdisciplinary research base and Research Cores. The VDRC leadership is responsible for determining the
membership of the VDRC, allocating VDRC support of research cores, overseeing the Pilot and Feasibility
Program and VDRC training efforts, and developing long-term VDRC strategy. Vanderbilt continues to make a
sustained and substantial commitment of space and resources to the VDRC, and the Administrative
Component is responsible for integrating this with support provided by the NIH. The VDRC leadership, which
brings considerable research and administrative expertise and perspective, consists of: Director (Alvin
Powers); two Associate Directors (Nancy Cox and Owen McGuinness); and a distinguished Executive
Committee. In these VDRC efforts, the Director and the Administrative Component of the VDRC receive advice
from: 1) an Internal Advisory Committee 2) an External Advisory Committee; 3) the Pilot and Feasibility Review
Committee; and 4) a Research Training Advisory Committee. The VDRC's Enrichment Program oversees and
organizes robust enrichment activities, including a weekly seminar series, annual Diabetes Day, regular
meetings of VDRC's interest groups, and the National DRC Virtual Seminar Series. A major goal is to foster
the training and development of new diabetes investigators. In summary, an experienced and effective VDRC
management team, bolstered by sustained and substantial support from Vanderbilt, is working to ensure that
the VDRC's research base, core facilities, training activities, and enrichment efforts continue to be outstanding
and at the forefront of diabetes research."
10846733,"Animal Metabolic Physiology Core: Project Summary/Abstract
The Animal Metabolic Physiological Core (AMPC) is a new Vanderbilt Diabetes Research Center (VDRC)
Core. In prior VDRC cycles, mouse services for VDRC investigators had been provided by the Vanderbilt
Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center (MMPC; U24 DK059637). The Vanderbilt MMPC, an original and
continuous participant in the national MMPC national program, has been on the forefront of development,
standardization, and dissemination of techniques to study metabolism in mice for 20 years. NIDDK will retire
the national MMPC Program in June 2021. At the time this was announced, the VDRC was engaged in
strategic planning for its competitive renewal. VDRC investigators expressed concern as to how funded grants
could be executed and new scientific projects developed without these mouse services. Thus, the VDRC
proposes to create the AMPC to make these mouse services available to VDRC investigators. The rationale for
the AMPC is based on overwhelming feedback from VDRC investigators expressing a need to continue the
sophisticated mouse services that had been so impactful in their research (54 VDRC users, >24,000 services,
98 publications used this type of service in past 5 years). The AMPC will provide state-of-the-art research
techniques and expert guidance in integrative metabolic physiology to VDRC investigators. The AMPC
services and expensive equipment that will be made available through the AMPC are impractical to develop or
acquire and maintain in the lab of an individual investigator. Plus, the AMPC’s expertise and services
overcome barriers to studying the mouse and are highly integrated with VDRC services provided by the
Analytical Services Core, the Genomics and Human Physiology Core, and the Islet and Pancreas Analysis
Core. The AMPC will have an important role in training of fellows, students and staff which will serve to
propagate valuable concepts and technology. Thus, the AMPC and its services are vital to address the
research aims of funded grants and for the development of new scientific projects for VDRC investigators."
10846735,"Islet and Pancreas Analysis Core: Project Summary/Abstract
The Islet and Pancreas Analysis (IPA) Core was established in 2007 as a result of growing demand for murine
islets from Vanderbilt Diabetes Research Center (VDRC) investigators. Over the last funding cycle, the IPA
Core provided services to 47 different investigators (40 Vanderbilt and 7 external nonprofit) by assisting with
4,120 procedures. Research programs within the VDRC encompass the fields of pancreatic islet biology,
development, and function in normal homeostasis and disease, including a broad spectrum of islet-related
processes raging from intracellular signaling, physiological response and adaptation, the immunology of type 1
diabetes, the function of islet-enriched transcription factors, and the maintenance of normal hormone-secreting
status and cell fate. Essential to rigorous research in these areas is the ability to robustly isolate murine islets
and to assay the complex physiological function of both murine and human islets. Vanderbilt has been a
national leader in developing islet functional assays, as evidenced by the selection of the NIDDK-supported
Integrated Islet Distribution Program (IIDP) to house the Human Islet Phenotyping Program (HIPP) at
Vanderbilt under direction of Marcela Brissova, IPA Core Director. The HIPP's location at Vanderbilt has
greatly benefitted VDRC Investigators, allowing newly developed procedures to be seamlessly implemented
through the IPA Core. In addition to offering functional assays, the IPA Core also provides VDRC investigators
with high-resolution, whole-slide image scanners that enable simultaneous analysis of both tissue architecture
and single cell morphology. Numerous VDRC investigators utilize the imaging infrastructure and associated
analytical tools, and in this competitive renewal, the IPA Core proposes the addition of multiplex imaging to
perform high impact, tissue-based studies. While access to this technology is cost-prohibitive and technically
challenging for individual labs, offering it as a core service will significantly enhance the impact of histological
analysis of mouse and human tissue. The IPA Core is also working closely with the Animal Metabolic
Physiology Core (AMPC) to standardize islet transplantation techniques, a valuable experimental resource that
will complement existing ex vivo assays and allow more investigators to perform in vivo studies. Through its
centralized resources and expertise, the IPA Core provides VDRC investigators with reliable and standardized
procedures that facilitate discoveries related to islet biology, cell signaling, and metabolism. The continued
excellence of the IPA Core is crucial to sustain rigorous and impactful work in the areas of pancreas and islet
development and physiology by VDRC investigators."

Congenital heart disease is a major cause of illness in newborns and children. While studying Leigh’s
syndrome, a mitochondrial metabolism disease caused by LRPPRC that also causes congenital heart disease
and heterotaxy, we were surprised to discover that regional metabolism in the early Xenopus embryo dictates
cell fate. We found that the Spemann-Mangold Organizer (the Organizer) depends on regional metabolism. In
fact, our work demonstrates that Hif-1α regulates the specification of the Organizer and that the Organizer
consumes 20% more oxygen than more ventral (non-Organizer) tissue. To reconcile an increase in oxygen
consumption and activation of Hif-1α, we discovered that the Organizer has “leak” metabolism, which we have
proposed previously in our group to be caused by the c-subunit of the ATP Synthase. This proposal
investigates a signaling pathway that connects canonical Wnt signaling, Hif-1α, and regional metabolism to
understand an iconic signaling center, the Spemann-Mangold Organizer."
